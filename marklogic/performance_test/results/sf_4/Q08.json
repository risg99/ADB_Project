  "text": "We had my sons birthday party this weekend there. Needless to say, I will never go back and talked to the manager twice and all he could do was make excuses for the terrible service we got. Our \"party planner\" (I won't name her on here)was completely checked out, sat in the dark room ( not with the kids) playing on her phone. Thankfully my friends were there to serve the kids drinks and pizza. We paid for laser tag, ball blasters and black light mini golf. The laser tag was broken, one ball blaster wasn't working so one kid had to sit and watch and we never got to play mini golf. We had no clue what was going on or what activity was next as our party planner was no where to be found. We talked to the manager and he gave each kids ( there were 8) tokens to play arcade games... ha! What a joke. The games were broken and just took their tokens or didn't spit out the tickets. I called the manager today and he told me she is his best girl and something must be wrong. It's sad if that is his best girl. He told me to call him and he will let my kids play golf anytime on him. I said no thank you, we will not be returning. What really pissed me off was having to leave a $25 to a girl who played on her phone. I should have tipped my friends. I will never go back again.",

Which is dumb cus I didnt like to curse much back then and I was in training which I knew they will ask the girl how the training went. So I basically had to be on my best behavior. I was upset that they would believe a new girl over me. That was back in 2013. I would have still worked there. Also they got mad at me and my friend for speaking Russian and when I told them that they always speak Spanish they got mad. Lmao oh well. Food is bomb though.

I went for the five-piece combo with original chicken, slaw as my salad, and the corn fritter as my side (as opposed to fries). The chicken was crunchy and extremely juicy, while the slaw was fresh and had lots of hearty carrot in it. I loved the corn fritter, which was served in a milky, sweet liquid. I did not find the chicken too greasy, and the price point was great. The place is rather small with most people doing take out.

We also ordered the Mac and cheese with hot chicken added, which we had seen was recommended on Yelp prior, however, while it was also really tasty, the pizza outdid it BY FAR. If ordering pizza, our waitress recommended ordering any pizza with mozzarella cheese, as they make it in house along with their crusts and breads. I also saw quite a few sandwiches and burgers, which looked good too. You may have to wait for a table and something I wish I had known was that there is additional open seating upstairs, however, regardless it was worth the wait and I will definitely return!",

  "text": "We stopped by Sun King and thought we would check out the new Oca restaurant/shop inside. Oca, meaning \"Goose\", is a spin-off for Goose the Market that opened inside the public area of the brewery. Although they hadn't \"officially\" announced they were open, I had heard that they were open in the evenings and were working through a soft opening process. So glad we stopped by!\n\nMy wife and I both tried one of the bundled French Bread sandwiches. Tonight's featured City Ham and Gruyere with Dijon mustard, tarragon, and mini sweet pickles (cornichons). I placed our order at the counter, paid, and gave my name. They asked if I wanted the sandwiches toasted (yes!) and that allowed me time to pick up a couple drafts at the Sun King counter. As soon as I was making my way back to our table, the Oca staff called out my name and I was good to go. \n\nI loved the crispy crunch of the bread and the toasting brought out the flavors of the ham and cheese. Excellent pairing for the spices too. Can't wait to come back to try some of the sausages and charcuterie. \n\n*****update******\nI made it back one evening and decided to try the Choucrote Garnie which may as well translate to \"meat lover's dream!\"  Actually, it's a \"traditional dish of France's Alsace region bordering Germany\" and the Choucrote is fermented cabbage while the Garnie means it is dressed with Riesling (white wine), herbs, potatoes, and charcuterie.\n\n This huge option is brought out in a roasting pan.  My eyes started to glaze over at all the meats.  In the center was a large peppery Knack(wurst) nestled over a large serving of the Choucrote.  To the left was a thick (a full inch) smoked rib chop that was the most tender pork chop I've had.  In the upper left corner were two Nuremberg sausage (technically much larger at about 5 inches instead of the 9 cm traditional).  The Nuremberg have a thicker casing and more in the Bratwurst family.  To the right of the Knack were a couple slices of Pancetta that looked like American bacon, but have a higher salt content.  Just below that, there were two Strasbourg frankfurters.  Oh, and there were two potatoes that were halved and roasted.\n\nThe Choucrote itself was a great surprise at how much I enjoyed it.  My mother used to make a really nasty version of sauerkraut and dressed it with white vinegar.  I hated it!  But here, the pungent odor of vinegar is replaced by the pleasing notes of the Riesling.  The sour of the dish is tempered as well, so the overall taste is quite pleasing, especially since it is warm and served thoroughly tender. (I am not a fan of the sometimes rubbery and tough texture of raw cabbage.)\n\nThe portion size suggests it is for two to four people.  They mean it on this dish!  I made really great headway on devouring the dish, but common sense struck me before I was stuffed and decided to get a to go box.  Not for the picky eater, this is a dish that goes great with a dark beer (I went with the Sun King \"Stuck in the Middle\" Milk Stout option. Yum!)\n\n*****back to the original review*****\n\nAs if I didn't have enough reasons to stop by Sun King already, now I can get great quality sandwiches while there. Note that Oca sells packaged meats to take home if you stop by to fill your growler.\n\nTech stuff: They are open generally the same hours as the brewery.  Parking is free in the Sun King lot.  A number of platters are meant for 2 to 4 people, so bring friends!\n\nReview #439\nRev #30",

I loved my Afghani meatballs, my sister loved  her kebab (not the most appetizing looking thing, but it was spiced well), and the four different appetizers we tried out were all gone quickly (they were on the smaller side, so we could each only have a bite or so each).",

There are great choices of calzone ingredients to choose from and if I want to build my own, I have that option too. The salads are also huge portions and super filling if you're not in the mood for a tasty calzone. Great beers on tap and wine selection too.

Have had Groups there multiple times, even one that filled one of their larger banquet rooms.  So it was a no brainer to consider Maggiano's for a family Xmas eve dinner. \n\nAll that said; I am so disappointed in a gentleman named Brewster...here's the deal; have a reservation for a large party (8) at a very busy time (Xmas Eve) and had called to see if we could add an extra person.  I called completely understanding that this may be a long shot, not expecting they/he could come thru in a pinch!  He did!!  Awesome \n\nUnfortunately, he was so rude about it (didn't even say \"goodbye\") when he hung up the phone, I couldn't believe it!!  Seriously??!!  \n\nThanks for fitting us in Brewster, I do appreciate that, but geez, at least if your going to give me something, do it with a little grace...tis the season I suppose!!\n\nUpdate; well regardless of how rude Brewster had been on the call for the reservation; the dinner ended up fantastic!  Excellent service, great food...highly recommend it for a large party!!",

Hopefully you never have any issues but if you do like the cleaning guy stealing your things and yelling at you on multiple occasions, you will not be taken care of by management. There are way more apartments with professional staff in the gulch area than what I've experienced here. If you work with maintenance directly they are pretty good about it luckily I have gotten to know those guys. The cleaning guy is running some kind of side business selling things the residents throw away which makes him all too eager to take your things. I know this because he has asked me about buying those things off him before...didn't think I would be having issues with solicitors at my gulch apartment. Just a really weird experience.",

It's in a converted seven-bay garage and is influenced by all types of cultures - Spanish on the wall directing you to the bathroom, traditional Jewish cuisine with a twist as well as miso soup on the menu) But, I really enjoyed it even though we waited a little over an hour. \n\nWe had the: \n\n*potato & rutabaga latke (acorn squash butter, green harissa cream, scallion) - this was SO good. I don't think I've ever had a latke, but it was tasty. Not too oily. The flavors will the butter, cream and scallion were perfect. \n\n*cranberry walnut & geneva & raclette grilled cheese (black truffle honey, local sunny duck egg) - Whew, I'm glad I shared this dish because it was very heavy. Extremely delicious but if I ate the entire grilled cheese myself, I'd definitely fall into a food coma. \n\n*indiana hot chicken wings (dried chiles & crystal sauce, bleu cheese dressing, carrot & celery slaw) - this was SERIOUS business. I've had seriously hot nashville chicken, but damn this was SO spicy. I loved it though!\n\nThe only thing I didn't love was the camellia drink I had (apple, matcha, pistachio and steamed milk). It was grainy from the pistachio maybe? and just an interesting but not that tasty combination of flavors. Also, a small cup was $6!!! Ridiculous.",

I said yes they do with properly letting the customer know beforehand or in writing in their brochures. She said well this is how we do it...so tonight will be my last order. She never even tried to accommodate her error in taking the order wrong and make amends , especially with a long time good customer.

My SO and I were so saddened that it decided to move to a new location because we didn't know where to go for solid BBH as we wait for it to open back up again. But the wait is over!!! We both ordered the deluxe BBH and while the taste is the same and still so delicious I thought the freshness of the beef cuts dropped. It tasted like the beef was several days old. Perhaps the BBH we got was on the later end of the batch, because I do know at the old place- they mass make it during one of the days and just store it in plastic containers and reheat as it is ordered. Will definitely give it many more chances because the flavor is still solid.",

  "text": "As a vegetarian for a few years now, I can't say I ever crave the taste of meat, including burgers. \n\nBurger Study offers the Beyond Beef veggie burger that \"bleeds\" (from the use of beets) and was created for omnivores to give it a shot in the hopes that it'll convince them to not eat as much meat. I was excited, at first, to see that this place carried this. \n\nNow that I've tried it, I hope that Burger Study will look into creating their own veggie burger, in addition to the Beyond Beef patty that they currently use. I feel that the Beyond Beef burger option was an \"easy way out\" for them. Put it on the grill and it's done....not much effort involved. It tastes eerily a lot like meat and the bleeding part is just weird for me.\n\nI tried a few of the sides while dining here (all of which come separate). They were all a-okay but the portions are way too small for the price tag that comes along with them. I honestly don't remember which apps we tried as nothing left a major mark for me.\n\nMy biggest issue with Burger Study: the price tag + the small portion sizes just don't add up. I always create two meals when I dine out. I ate all of my burger (and sampled a few apps) and was still hungry.\n\nMy favorite part of the dining experience was the bourbon milkshake.... now THAT was yummy and worth the price tag. They bring out the milkshake and then pour the bourbon into the milkshake in front of you. Pretty neat. \n\nIn terms of decor and interior: it could use some work. It takes the restaurant name fairly seriously. Books around and some random photos and that's about it. \n\nBurger Study has the potential to be a great place; however, at the time of this writing, there are other, better burger spots around Indy that I'd recommend checking out before this place, especially for you vegetarians/vegans.",

I visit often since I work around the corner and I'm never let down by the mouthwatering breakfast sandwiches and paninis. \nFrom the moment I walked in over a year ago, the staff treated me as if they had known me my whole life. Greeting me with a friendly smile and making time for small talk even when busy. \nCoffee is fresh and always hot. I'm always a little hesitant to review coffee shops since some let their coffee sit and get bitter. This does NOT happen at Cafe Envie. I've gotten coffee throughout the day and into the evening. It's always fresh.",

The patio was lovely as always, the waitstaff was attentive. \n\nThe food was hit and miss. Between the 4 of us, 2 left satisfied and the other two not so much. We had a severely overcooked veggie burger that was sent back, a range avocado burger that was completely devoid of any flavor. \n\nThe tortilla soup and mushroom burger were good. \n\nFor the price for a burger I was hoping for more. \n\nNot sure I will go back for more than a beverage.",

Started to yell at me and then the owner of the moving company tells me he lost his temper.  \n\nLong story short, the employees are no longer with the company because they have had other issues.  But the bigger problem is that Art (owner) refuses to pay for the damages.  At this point I just want my $$ for the damage to the old place and move on.

We also had to ask a different server for the check and didn't even see our waitress until we were walking out - we paid in cash so we wouldn't have to wait any longer. The food was tasty but a little less than the ideal heat temperature I expect of getting in a plate of barbecue and mac and cheese.

  "text": "My experience at Coast Dental this morning was beyond horrific! I cannot believe that I wasted my time, money, and energy. Let me begin:\n\nWhen I arrived for my 10:30AM appointment, I was left waiting for over 40 minutes before being called back into the exam room. Then the medical assistant came in and told me that she would be taking TWELVE x-rays, despite my informing her that I have already had recent x-rays that I can transfer over from my previous dentist. She insisted that she needed to take her own x-rays and despite my protests about not wanting to be exposed to radiation from a dozen x-rays, she took the images anyway. On the 11th x-ray, I opened my mouth slightly because of the pressure from the metal rod in my mouth and the stick fell out. The medical assistant came running in the room and rudely said, \"You don't have to spit it out!\" I was shocked and told her that I hadn't intended for it to fall out of my mouth, that I absolutely had not spit it out, and that because my arms were restrained by the weighted x-ray jacket, I did not have use of my arms to catch the stick as it was falling (it only landed on my chest, not on the floor.) For the remainder of the x-ray session, the medical assistant was unnecessarily rude.\n\nThen I waited another half hour for the dentist to come in. When she arrived, she briefly looked at my teeth, told me that I had not cavities, and said that I would have to make an additional appointment with the dental hygienist for a cleaning (though I had made my appointment for a cleaning today, they said that they do one appointment for x-rays, a second appointment for an exam, a third appointment for a cleaning... instead of the one appointment that most dentists do for an annual cleaning.) I have a chip on one of my front teeth, so I asked the dentist about having it shaved down. She said that she would refer me to the in-house orthodontist who would take care of it. Then the dentist left.\n\nI was left in the exam room for another 40 minutes before the medical assistant came back in and said, \"We forgot to tell you that you can leave now.\" What?? You left me in the exam room unnecessarily for over half an hour?!?! \n\nI have Invisalign, so before I left the room, I asked the medical assistant if there is anything that I can do at home to clean the brackets. She said that she would check with Dr. Patel and let me know in a few minutes. Instead of going to ask the doctor, I saw her walk into the break room (leaving the door open), pull her lunch out of the fridge, and sit down next to another medical assistant. I waited for 20 more minutes while I watched her chat with her friend and finally realized that she was not going to ask the dentist my question, so I got up and left. \n\nWhen I checked out, I asked the front receptionist (Chris) to make an appointment with the in-house orthodontist to have my chipped tooth smoothed. He told me that since I have Invisalign, if I want to see the orthodontist for any reason whatsoever, I have to start my Invisalign treatment COMPLETELY OVER and pay out of pocket. That's right: even though having my chipped tooth shaved down has NOTHING to do with my Invisalign (which is being treated by another orthodontist), the only way that the in-house orthodontist will see me for my chipped to is if I agree to re-do my Invisalign treatment with him by having all of my brackets taken off, the Invisalign molds re-done, and new retainers made. This was the most absurd thing that I had ever heard and was nothing more than a greedy play at having me pay out-of-pocket for a treatment that is almost complete (I'm on my last Invisalign tray) and that has nothing to do with my chipped tooth. Between this and the 12 x-rays taken by the medical assistant, I question the ethics of Coast Dental. \n\nI wish that I had read the other reviews online before attending my appointment this morning because every other patient has detailed my experience and it would have saved me from wasting a beautiful morning. Coast Dental does not operate like a normal dentist's office. They seem intent on drawing out treatment plans to maximize their profit, they are manipulative in their practices, and they seem to care very little for the patient. Additionally, the exam room was filthy. The floors had dirt and dust. When I entered the room, the medical assistant told me to place my purse on top of the \"medical waste\" bin. THE MEDICAL WASTE BIN! I told her that I was pretty certain that was a biomedical hazard and that I didn't want to place my bag on top of the open medical waste container, but she told me that was the only place for it. Again, another completely bizarre occurrence at Coast Dental.\n\nIf you make an appointment here, plan to spent at least 2 hours and to only be seen by the dentist for approximately 10 minutes. Be ready to be dismissed, minimized, manipulated, and prompted to pay out-of-pocket for completely absurd treatment plans.",

  "text": "My wife, 6 year old daughter and I arrived on a Thursday during lunch time and noticed a sign advising to wait to be seated. We waited but noticed no one was around to receive us. So after looking around and finding no wait staff, we decided to go seat ourselves. After about 3 minutes we were greeted by a waitress. \n\nThe restrooms were not clean. This should've been the first red flag. The doors, light switches and anywhere people touch were caked with dark brown grease/dirt and there were no paper towels available either. This made me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen. \n\nMy wife ordered the cashew chicken and the Mongolian beef for me. The mongo beef was good with green and white onions and a good sauce. The cashew chicken looked and tasted bad. The veggies appeared to have been canned and the the sauce was milky white colored. The chicken was breaded and soggy. Definitely stay away from their cashew/almond chicken if you decide to come here. \n\nThe egg rolls that came with the lunch special were freshly made but a little hard and weird tasting. The fried rice was good. The service was okay. The wait staff was friendly but not very interested in checking up on us. Had to wave them down for things.\n\n$7.50 lunch special enticed us but would have rather gone to Panda Express across the street if we would have known about the lack of cleanliness and food quality.",

I told our bartender and he said I'll let the kitchen know but never took the salad off my bill. Today we ordered takeout because we're extremely busy with Christmas orders and I got another brown salad. I went back and told the food manager and he yelled at ME for not being nice. We used to eat at this place 4-5 times a week between dinners and lunch take out. No more. You're off my list. How dare you serve me old brown slop for food and then yell at me. \n\nA different horrible experience was a few months ago. Bring noise cancelling headphones because the music is intended to please the staff NOT the customers. Loud, head banging horrible music. I looked around the patio and inside the restaurant and aside from a few youngsters at the bar we were the youngest people in the place and I'm sure no one was enjoying it. My brain was bleeding. And when the music slowed down a depressing song came on about a man using needles and crying because all his friends were dead. Made for a very unappetizing and horrible lunch experience. \n\nWe usually get take out because our very first experience with this place was very similar but lately they've been burning our food beyond recognition and forgetting important items like salad dressing. How do you let food leave your restaurant like that? \n\nWhen the food is done right  it's really good. The Greek salad and the crispy salmon are my fav dishes. But I can't deal with the music. We eat out everyday but there are numerous good restaurants in our area to choose from.",

  "text": "Stop reading reviews and go eat at Murph's. \n\nStill here? Well, I guess I'll give you my two cents, then. I don't know how anyone can give this place anything but 5 stars. Murph's is one of a kind, and it does what it does perfectly. It's a relaxed neighborhood bar, staffed by neighborhood people, and an authentic Italian chef who creates some of the best Italian food on the planet. Trust me, I've eaten so much Italian food. It's a problem, actually.\n\nYou won't find a better meal, at a better price in the city. I have read a few of the negative reviews, and I just can't get with them. Customer service issues? Never in my million, bazillion visits to Murph's have I experienced bad service. They get super busy in there, sure. It can be loud sometimes, sure. It's a flippin' neighborhood bar, not the GD Ritz! If the soup Nazi was running this place, if I had to wash my own dishes after, if I had to catch my food mid-air with my mouth, I would still be eating at this Murph's! (A side note about people who have ONE bad experience and feel the need to write a negative review for a business - someone's life work, the result of their dream, blood, sweat, and tears - all because it wasn't what you expected. Seek help.)\n\nFurthermore, about Murph's, get the pear and cheese fiocchi if it's still on the revolving menu. My boyfriend and I usually split it as an appetizer (it's an entree), and then get two other pasta dishes for our meal, so we can consume as many dishes as possible in one sitting. It's all made fresh, it's all perfectly balanced, portions are just right and the prices cannot be beat. So far, after every meal we have been treated to a delicious limoncello, homemade by the chef's wife. It's outstanding, and just a nice touch, adding to the, \"You're home. You belong here,\" feeling of the place.\n\nI'm going to leave it at that for now, because I'm getting way too hungry writing this. it's a good thing I have plans to have dinner at Murph's tomorrow night.",

It's obvious that they prioritize appointments over walk-ins. \n\nIt's also obvious that they are used to dealing with patients who are combative or otherwise difficult. The nurses were very no-nonsense (\"Don't flush, don't wash your hands until you bring me the sample, you have four minutes etc. etc.) and aren't really in the mood for small talk. Come prepared (read: hydrated), be polite, and it'll take 5 minutes to get in and out.",

Great food and drinks as well. \n\nLocated in a good spot on the strip next to a few hotels, you can't beat something this good within walking distance. They have a lot of seating which is always nice (and a good sign).\n\nI had the shrimp tacos which were amazing. They were sweeter than I normally like, as I normally like spicy, but they were delicious. They had jicama coleslaw with pineapple in it. The sauce on top really perfected it.\n\nMy husband had the blackened grouper sandwich which was cooked perfectly. \n\nDefinitely recommend!",

  "text": "My daughter had two vision screenings at her daycare- one in July and one in early December of this year, during these last 6 months, they progressively worsened. As a result, I decided to locate an optometrist who works with pediatrics and has the patience needed. I called three different places that Google recommended including Envision Eyecare Center, Banner Ophthalmology,  and Sato's office. The Banner people were rude and not helpful (review pending), the staff at Sato's office were equally as rude and unhelpful; nonetheless, I made an appointment with them (for mid- January 2018). Finally, I called Envision Eyecare Center and they were so personable on the telephone and were able to get me in the following week. I called Sato's office and cancelled my appointment and showed up at Envision a few days ago (12/27/17). \n\nEveryone from the front desk person (Erica) to the optometric technician (Jessica) to Dr Barry and the licensed dispensing optician (Laura) were amazing and most of all patient with a 3 year old: \n\nErica greeted us upon entry even though she was with another patient. We waited patiently for our turn and then check-in, filled out appropriate paperwork, provided our insurance card and ID and sat in their waiting area. They even had a smaller kid-sized table and chairs. Erica came and showed my kiddo where the toys were and helped her get settled in as we patiently waited our turn. Unlike, most of my experiences with doctor's office we only waited the 15 minutes we were early and were then called back by Jessica. \n\nJessica introduced herself to me, but most importantly to her- YES, TO A KID! Jessica asked my kiddo if she felt more comfortable with her sitting on my lap or on the chair alone, being my kid- she responded \"alone.\" She then proceeded to ask me the questions only a parent could answer and would intermittently check-in with my kiddo. *MAJOR KUDOS FOR THAT* This built immediate rapport with my kiddo and my kiddo proceeded onto the exam. At the end of Jessica's part, she even remembered to get my kiddo the cup of water that she had previously promised her. *KUDOS X2 FOR FOLLOWING THRU*\n\nDr Barry came in, introduced himself to mom and dad and than to our kiddo. He was a slender, mid-height, older gentleman with one of the kindest faces I have ever seen. He had an appropriate level of energy and made us (mom & dad) laugh occasionally. He was extremely knowledgeable of his \"trade\" and was able to effectively explain to both of us what exactly was going on with our kiddo's eyes, how the school screening went and was his recommendations would be. By this time, my kiddo was becoming inpatient and her attention span was shorter and shorter, not to worry though, Dr. Barry was able to hold it for as long as he could for each step of his examination. He even offered to take a picture with her for her first exam, but she declined and told \"next time.\" \n\nFinally, Dr Barry escorted us to a section adjacent to the waiting area where there were numerous frames, big, small and some for the kiddos. Laura came out and helped us. Showed us a cabinet with kiddo frames and my kiddo went away trying them on until she finally decided on ones she liked and the rest is history...well actually, we're waiting for them now. \n\nI've had glasses for many years and so has the hubby, we've only had two seamless interactions (including this one) and we're so happy we know our kiddo is in good hands. We were also happy to find out that we can bring our prescriptions to Laura (or one of the other ladies) and get our frames here as well!",

It was a Friday night around 6:45 and we were seated right away, but shortly after a line formed of people waiting for seats. \nThe restaurant is large and simply decorated. It's BYOB, so don't forget your favorite bottle! All of the employees were  friendly. Our waitress was very busy but she was still attentive and a great server. \nWe started with the salt and spicy pepper calamari. I was surprised that it didn't come with a dipping sauce, but after eating\nIt we decided it didn't need one. The little green chilies that were sprinkled on top were very spicy, which was a nice way to cut the richness and saltiness. We ate the whole plate- they were delicious. \nWe also got the fried pork dumplings and they were very good as well. Pretty typical dumplings with a nice dipping sauce. \nFor our meals we split the Singapore curry noodles and the chicken in spicy garlic sauce over jasmine rice. The curry noodles were different than most curries I've had. They were dry but had a nice flavor. The chicken in garlic sauce was addicting. I couldn't stop eating it, despite being incredibly full. We can't wait to eat our left overs today, and will definitely be coming back in the future.",

In the last 4 visits I have had the following problems:\n\nTwice have I gotten home to find that the pizza was either not cut at all, or only partially cut. You had one job dude with the pizza cutter. Remind me again why a minimum wage job should be a working wage? There's a reason some jobs should not pay enough to support a family.\n\nTwice have I sat waiting for my pizza (over 15 minutes the most recent time!) only for some genius to look at the rack of boxed pizzas and realize that my order was sitting there all along. I can see the rack, I can see when boxed pizza is added to the rack. Not that there will be a next time, but if there was I would ask them to read me the names on each pizza if I show up and they tell me it isn't ready yet.\n\nThese are all problems specific to this location.

The space is so much smaller than I had anticipated but it just ads to the intimacy and charm of such an old building. The jazz music, singing and band were wonderful and we had such a great time. No photos or video are allowed inside. Just sit back, relax and enjoy every minute of the show",

Its either as pale as an English person who has not seen the sun in a year or burnt (not dark brown - its burnt).\nThey do ask you if the pale version is okay.. when you ask for it more toasted it burns and they hide it on the plate.. then you try to nicely say it's too burnt and they do try again. (How they cant see that themselves I'll never know....) After the second try I give up and eat it. It's usually a mix of half pale and burnt. \nI wont be back unless I get the bagels to go and take care of the toasting at home.\n\nOn a positive note, the staff are very friendly!!",

As another reviewer stated, I also got a \"weird\" vibe from the staff - no one was friendly at all, except for the bartender, who was only slightly so.  Our waiter was okay, but again, not friendly at all - more \"robotic\" when citing the specials, taking our orders, etc. My husband spent a small fortune on drinks and dinner - which were good - but not really worth what they were charging.  It's a beautiful place, if only the staff had a bit of warmth in their demeanor.  Overall, I was disappointed and I'm not sure if we will be back.",

I got the three eggs breakfast and a biscuit and while it's more simple, it was still delicious.  We're from Chicago so we're no stranger to delicious brunches and this one was truly such a treat.",

The manager said why didn't you buy it the first time you were here then and basically told me he dosent know what to tell me so I said I was going to shop elsewhere and he said OK. I was blown away from the lack of professionalism. The furniture is cheaply made anyway. Ended up going to ashley furniture the same day, got my daughter a 5 piece bedroom set for 1,800!!!!

All of a sudden my cars RPM starting skyrocketing at a low speed, feeling like it was in cruise control--even would remain driving while in neutral. Then all of a sudden a strange metal scraping sound from my passenger side front tire. And then to top it all off, my rear passenger tire almost FELL OFF WHILE DRIVING!!!!!! Felt like it was wobbling and all this smoke started coming out!! Brought it to another shop and somehow the wheel bearing and cap were missing!!! So now I have to pay $240 to repair this!! \n\nNEVER EVER GO HERE!!! \nI wish I would've thoroughly read the reviews before I went! I now see on other review sites that many others have had issues with this place too!!!

All the dishes are pretty good, but the escargot was particularly delicious and creamy. We even asked for more bread to soak up the sauce with.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the seared duck breast which came over a bed of risotto. The duck breast was cooked to Perfection and melted in your mouth.\n\nLeslie and for dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle and the Apple Brandy creme brulee. The chocolate souffle came with some sort of pour-over sauce, it was delicious creamy and chocolatey. The Apple Brandy creme brulee was unique in that it wasn't overly sweet with the caramelized sugar on top. The Brandy Apple flavor was refreshing with little bits of Apple on top",

Hope those 2 experienced drivers they inserted in to our race are proud of themselves busting up first timers consisting of mostly teen girl drivers.

Thankfully they were one of very few that actually opened. We arrived around 5:30 and there was 3 large groups ahead of us. We got seated about an hour later. Thing we're hectic and I don't think they were prepared for the heavy crowds as they were running out of utensils and cups. They finally take our order which took a really long time and the food came out a lot later. Although the food took a long time and they seemed unprepared, I think they still handled it well. (Maybe they will take this as a lesson for next year) Everyone was friendly and by the end of the night it seemed they had called in more people to help. I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was flavorful. The spring rolls & spring salad were ask very delicious.

Have tried twice now and both times have been delicious and consistent. \n\nThe brisket is super satisfying, being strips instead of ripped to shreds and swimming in sauce. \n\nThe fried pickles are fried spears, not chips, so you get more bang for your buck with this item. The batter on them is so light and flavorful; they can definitely stand on their own without the dipping sauce. \n\nThe best thing, hands down, is the banana cream pie milkshake. Heaven in a cup. \n\nIf the prices weren't such a ripoff ($18+ just for a brisket sandwich and milkshake), I'd go more often.",

I got the enchiladas verdes and they were very enjoyable. It was a huge portion and was enough to take home. My fellow diners really enjoyed the quesadillas and enchiladas poblanas.

  "text": "This was my Third time visiting and will be my last.\nMy family from Europe was visiting on their very 1st day (November 20th) so we decided to give this place one last try only because of the proximity from my house.\nFirst thing, when we walked in trying to get a little bite at 9:15 pm after coming from the airport, we asked the hostess if they were still serving. She gave us a look as if we were crazy to \"disturb\" her that late. She replied \"Well, I'll ask my manager\", who was just right there by the bar. Next thing she did was taking the menus and taking us back to seat down with an unwelcoming attitude. (I almost left but we had guests). If I were the manager, she would be unemployed right now, and if I was the owner, both of them (as a Manager, he didn't do his job)\nFrom there, the service was less than good. Our feelings were that nobody wants to be working here.\nSo now here comes the food, we ordered a vegetarian and Margherita pizza, both which came out raw. The only thing we liked was the lentil soup, that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars...\nAnd just one more thing... when my family left and we took them to the airport, they told us \"What a great trip and city!!... except for the first night at the Pizza place!!!\"",

Clearly this tire was not in good condition to begin with and when I called budget the representative told me I would be charged for someone to come out. They stated if I could put on the spare tire  myself I could come exchange the car, so that is what I did. I returned the car and was told by the person checking in the car that I would not be charged for the tire, as well as the girl at the counter issuing me a new vehicle. After issuing me 3 different vehicles that were not parked in the designated spots in the garage, I finally got another car and was on me way after 2.5 hours. \n\nAlso, I pre-paid for my rental and when I returned it I was changed an additional charge of $85. That took 3 phone calls and that was finally returned. \n\nWell about a week after returning the car I received a letter stating I was being charged $165 for the tire. I have called and spoke with 5 different people. I was told by one rep named Abel, that I would not be charge and he would note the account so anyone could see it. Guess what, I was charged. I called in again and mysteriously no one can see those notes. Finally I speak with a supervisor Taurean who stated he would look into this and call me back by Friday December 1st and I still have received no call. I have asked everyone I have spoken with for something in writing but they all state they can't give me that but they have \"noted\" the account. Such horrible service.

But plenty of fresh veggies and white chicken peices were provided. The to go box was huge with no sections, the fired rice was layed over foil for proper protection. Good deal and good value for $10. The hostess was nice and friendly as well.",

  "text": "I was told to never come back...by an immature abusive host. The meal started out fine. Then the host, a young man, began verbally abusing his mom. Raising his voice, after she seemingly asked an innocent question about a contract. He threw a box in the air in exasperation. She got up with her coffee to remove herself quietly from the situation and he chased after her stating \"Give me that, you don't deserve it\". He was trying to pull a hot coffee from her hands. He turned to me to address my astonishment and noted he was \"taking the coffee because it was unhealthy for her\". She doesn't need the coffee? I'm pretty she also doesn't need a disrespectful abusive son!! That will kill her quicker than any coffee will. If he treats her like that in front of customers I can't imagine what it is like behind closed doors. I left crying, heart broken for the woman. All customers in the establishment got up and left. Grow up young man and learn to treat others with respect. Your family business now suffers because of your actions.",

I wonder if it's because of complaints by people in the neighborhood. I hope they will make it stinky again! Other than that all their food has been consistent in flavor! There are so many dishes I love there and if I name them all, it'll be the whole menu. The main reason I love this place is that they serve authentic Taiwanese dishes. They're not like other Asian restaurants with limited menu that gears to only westerners. I'm glad this place expanded because they're always packed!",

Obviously there were tons of kids there, with their unlimited energy. Trampolines are an insane workout, and Flying Spider is very aware of this because they offer classes to get your heart pumping. But I've seen teens, adults, and middle-aged people here, all having a blast; that's because this place is so fun. If I ever have a 1st date with a girl, I bring her here. It's way more fun than dinner and a movie. They have zip-lines , dodgeball, and tons of different trampoline types and areas. Not to mention the prices are extremely fair. But on top of all of this, the staff are so great. Everyone is extremely friendly and have a genuine positive energy that makes this place better than anywhere else. \n When I eventually have kids, I'll be bringing them here, this place is great.",

  "text": "I've used this location for tire work, oil changes, etc. multiple times without incident, and have been pleased with their customer service.\nYesterday, I called to confirm an appointment to get tires switched to snow tires, oil change, and headlight replacement. I asked the technician whether it would be a problem if he could leave the key under the floor mat so that I could pick the car up after they closed at 6pm.   He assured me that leaving the key under the mat would be no problem.\nAt 5:30, I called to confirm that I would, in fact for sure not be there until after 6, but would the work be done by 6, and would the key would be left under the mat.  \nThe new manager reacted wirh surprise, and explained she could not allow the key to be put inder the mat after hours because of liability and theft concerns, despite what her employee had told me.\nThis required that I change my transportation plans to go back and get my car immediately.   I had to call for an Uber (rather than rely on a friend who got off work after 6pm) so that I would be there before they closed at 6 p.m.\nI arrived via Uber, with the cost associated with, shortly before 6 pm. Although they were now closed, my car was not ready until well after 6:30 pm. When I explained that my car had been promised to be ready at 6 p.m. and that I thought they wouldn't wait because of them closing at 6 pm, I was cited corporate policy about leaving key under the mat, what a liability that was, Etc.\nI explained that now I had waited longer than promised and could have had my friend pick me up to take me to get my car, without incurring extra expenses because of their false deadlines and refusal to work with me by leaving a key under the mat.\nI was again cited corporate policy, they were not willing to be responsible for my car theft, Etc. ad nauseam.\nAll the manager had to do, was to tell me that they could not in the future leave my key under the mat, but that they would be willing to wait for me until 6:30 p.m.  That way, I would have understood their future policy, and had a reasonable solution to come get my car after hours. \nThe manager seemed so unreasonable to work with, citing nothing but corporate policy, concern about responsibility for car theft, etc.\nI simply refuse to do business with a branch location of a major corporation, who hires \"robots\" who simply want to cite corporate policy, and won't work with their customers.\nI do not recommend having your car repaired at this location, unless you want broken promises and the threat of having your car impounded unless you happen to have a spare key ready to use to pick up your car after hours.

  "text": "Full disclosure- This review is for soft opening. So excited that this location is finally open & absolutely thrilled with the menu! Carnivore husband would not stop stealing bites of my country fried seitan & loved the Mac n cheese croquettes (totally didn't realize it wasn't actually cheese).\nHands down best app was the poutine- that mushroom gravy is ridiculous. Mac n cheese croquettes were good but need consistency in sizing. One of the 3 was very large & frozen in the middle. Needs to be 4 balls honestly. The hot sauce served with them was fantastic & we drizzled it all over a sandwich as well. Polenta fries were good but have had them many other places with similar flavor profile.\nI want my last meal to be the country style- think chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes & Mac n cheese smothered in gravy. The Bahn Mi was my fave at the city market location & still fantastic. Something about those fresh sliced jalapeños. Friend really enjoyed cauliflower steak. Only disappointment was the pulled sandwich- it needed a sauce or maybe some slaw, tasted dry and missing something. We were served salads with the meals that had some really great dressing options. All the food looked amazing, the restaurant has really taken the next level with Three Carrot's food.\nThey have lunch & brunch menus so we will def be back to again. They will also have craft sodas (wasn't working first night) which is a fun addition. Healthy selection of wines & craft beers too. Service is still learning- they will figure it out but plan to be patient the first couple of weeks.\nThree Carrots is a gem because they do comfort food that isn't just vegan- it's legitimately honest to goodness food pure & simple.",

  "text": "Without a question the worst dining experience I and my 14 other friends have ever had. After confirming our reservation that same day, we showed up to a fully packed restaurant with no table for us. After waiting nearly an hour, we were finally seated with half of our party squished against the wall with no way of getting out (which would have process to be particularly problematic if anyone had to use the restroom).  About 15 min later we moved to a table that was just cleared but our food was not served until two hours after our reservation. The prix fixe menu items were all incorrect--the squid ink pasta had no squid ink pasta and all pasta was undercooked, the red sauce was watery and sans flavor. When we approached management to address all of these issues, the owner was unbearably rude, at times becoming belligerent and ultimately yelling. I have never been so blatantly disrespected in my life. As a patron expressing legitimate concerns with service, I was shocked to be berated and attacked by the owner (whose only excuse was \"it's a party of 15 in a small place what did you expect?\") how about this: if you can't seat a party with a reservation within ten minutes (or 25) then don't take reservations. This owner is a pig and a bully. \n\nPoor aesthetics, bad food, and abysmal service. DO NOT EAT HERE. Especially if in a large group. You'll thank me later.",

The channa masala was tasty, as well as this paneer dish that I can't recall the name of. The butter chicken was good, but could stand to be a little more spicy. Usually, I prefer tikka masala, but this was not offered. The chicken biryani was good, spiced very nicely, and had nice portions of chicken on the bone in it. Complimentary naan was offered, which was great. I think that the only thing missing, that I enjoy from an Indian buffet, is an assortment of fried vegetable appetizers, such as pakora or samosas.\n\nThe owner and his front house staff were very nice, and checked on us often. I'm looking forward to my next experience with them, hopefully the buffet offerings are changed up by then.",

  "text": "Tonight my husband and I brought a friend in for dinner. We arrived at 9pm looked at the menu for a few minutes and then ordered a pizza, appetizer, and a few drinks. Our drinks came midway through eating the appetizer. We actually just assumed they weren't coming. A few bites into our pizza we decided to order another of the same because it was so good and everyone was starving. The waitress came around collected our plates and silverware....then dropped off our pizza in a to go box. We told her we planned to eat it now & she responded, \"Well, we close at 10.\"  It was 9:50. I understand everyone wants to leave, but after spending almost $100 I thought it would be acceptable to stay at least until 10. I have been in the event/hospitality industry for 15 years and I have never been made to feel so uncomfortable and awkward. I would never complain about service if the restaurant was packed and understaffed, but we were 3 of 5 customers and there was no excuse for such poor service. There are way too many other good choices in our neighborhood for us to come back.",

  "text": "Let me begin by saying that I had been to Allora before, for lunch, dinner, and Easter dinner with my family and had never been disappointd...in fact gave a great review on Yelp last Easter.  But last night, our woman's club had their annual holiday party there (for a change in venue) and disappointment was the consensus all around.  Over 30 local woman from our club attended the dinner.  The space allotted to us was fine;  large and pretty private.  The dinner selection was fine. We were promised \"4 courses\" for the, I think, $28.00 pp plus tax and gratuity.  The service was fine.  But here is an accurate description of the food and you be the judge.\nFirst \"course\" was salad, which was served on a saucer sized plate and consisted of 3 literally forkfuls of salad.  Second \"course\" was another saucer of penne pasta.  I counted LITERALLY 6 pieces of tiny penne on my plate.  When I joked about it with my fellow members, everyone commented on how skimpy the serving was.  One person bragged she had gotten 7 pieces on her plate. I commented on this to the head server (who appeared to be the manager) and he said that he was giving us a bargain for 4 courses at such a price.  When I replied that he probably had paid like 30 cents for a pound of pasta to feed us all, he said, \"oh I am only kidding..but the servings are intended to be appetizer size portions.\"  Sorry, dude, but 6 one inch penne is not an appetizer by any stretch, and since pasta is the cheapest thing you could serve, you could have at least given us, like 8 penne!  Our President was embarrassed by the negative comments (though it was not her fault) and she, too, told the manager of our disappointment. So by now we are all starving and filling up on bread.  Our entrees were on the smaller side compared to other Italian restaurants, but were acceptable.  The chicken parm I had was tasty and tender, and I think it was risotto with it, also creamy and tasty.  Those who had the short ribs said they were good.  The 4th \"course\" was dessert which consisted of a dish of 5-6 mini cannoli (they were dry and skimpily filled) and about a dozen very thin , small slices of soft biscotti (tasty) for the table of 8.  I mean it was \"ok\" as a dinner, but not what I had expected from my previous visits here, which had been much better.  To the managers:  when you have a group of Marlton woman coming into a Marlton restaurant, you should try to impress a little more, since we ae usually the decision makers on where we will bring our family to dine.  You missed the mark this time.",

  "text": "My friends and I are night owls and we love applebees for the awesome drink and apps specials and we go a few times a month.  That being said this past time going was the absolute worst experience I've ever had at an applebees or any restaurant really. \n\nOur server's name was Lorilyn(?) and she was just awful. We had to use the call server button just to get her attention after waiting 20 min to even get our drink orders. And then it took another 25 minutes to even get our drinks (some of which were wrong).  And then a half hour later we finally got our apps and still waiting on refills and for her to fix the wrong drinks but it sounded like she just completely forgot.  At one point we called the manager over and very calmly and politely pointed out all the issues we were having because at this point it had been like an hour and a half and we still didn't have the right drinks or even all the apps we ordered or even our food yet, but he did nothing to resolve any of it besides \"I'll go check on your food\"  it sounded like he didn't care at all.  And we're not ones to make a big scene and scream and moan over stuff so that's probably why he didn't actually do anything even though we were all very upset. \n\nWe finally get our food and over half the table just decided to get a to go box because it had been two hours and we weren't expecting to be there that long.  It was just really awful because three of us ordered the unlimited chicken tenders and riblits deal but couldn't even use it because of how incredibly slow it was. And the restaurant was over half empty. \n\nAs we were all checking out and getting ready to go we overhear our waitress badmouthing us.  Which was just absolutely unjustified because it was the worst service I've ever experienced and because we're good people we still tipped.  \n\nJust awful overall and will never go back to this applebees.",

  "text": "I was recommended to Cameo by my best friend who has her hair cut and colored by Lori, the owner. She knew how I was never satisfied with a hair cut and color, ever! Especially since it always costs so much. So I saw Lori for a blonde balayage and layered cut. I wasn't satisfied so I came back a second time and had some of the balayage redone to get my hair blonder as it still looked very brassy and not white blonde like I wanted. It seemed I had difficult hair and the color just wasn't lifting. She tried, but again I left ($400+ later) feeling like I'm just never going to leave a salon feeling truly happy with my hair. About 6 months later, I scheduled another appt with Lori to get my hair redone, but she was booked 2 months in advance. So I got in the same week with Samantha, who I was told was previously Lori's associate.  \n     Nervous about getting my hair done, as usual, and knowing that l have difficult to color, very thick hair I attempted to warn Sam about my hair.  I've been told by many, many stylists that I just need to use toner to get my hair blonder or that the color can never be lifted enough to get it the shade of blonde I want. (I had white blonde hair as a child and its gotten increasingly darker blonde over the years). However, Sam, (who also has blonde hair) listened, she colored, she cut, and MAGIC happened!  She had the color lifted to the right shade of blonde in half the time and used products to keep my hair healthy. She cut my hair wet then cut some more when dry. She was like Edward scissor hands, cutting so quickly! In the end, I left the salon for the very first time in my entire life feeling 100% satisfied with my cut and color! She is definitely a very skilled stylist. Sam is your girl if you have or want blonde hair or if you're not really sure what you want, she'll make magic happen, trust me!! Plus she's so nice, like all the staff there. \n     My only complaint is that the salon is very expensive and they all try to push the products on you.... like most salons do. But if you find the right stylist for you, it's worth it to feel beautifully transformed when you leave. Thank you, Samantha! My friend, Liz, still goes to Lori and loves her, her daughter gets her hair cut by Dominic, and my Aunt Caroline now sees Sarah and loves her.",

It has all of the amenities you'd typically find in a delta or American lounge, lots of comfortable seating, open bar, food buffet, business services, free newspapers, and even a shower. Some things that push AMEX a little above would be the premium drinks at the open bar (although they frequently run out of popular options), their signature mixed drinks, a dedicated \"phone room\" for taking calls which has been very helpful, and overall a level of service and attention that other lounges just don't offer. You really feel like they're taking care of you here, as opposed to just checking you in and getting you off their list. \n\nMy one reason for providing 4 stars is that I've never been very impressed with the food. Typically go for more of the protein-heavy options and it's just seemed very dry. Would appreciate a few more meat options (maybe with some sort of sauce?) but other than that really glad this lounge opened in Philly.",

  "text": "I really really wanted to love you, Cake Bake...but I just don't think I do.\n\nLet's start with the positive: the decor was so gorgeous. The place was decked out with twinkly Christmas lights and pink and white Christmas trees. It was very magically Victorian and I really felt like I was in a story book. The wait staff wore adorable pink and white dresses and aprons and the building itself is breathtaking. \n\nMy husband and I ordered a slice of red velvet cake, blue birthday cake and a cafe au lait. The red velvet had chocolate chunks and cream cheese icing layers which were tasty; however, the icing was a cross between a whippy frosting and a buttercream but not very sweet, surprisingly. It was almost like it was made with shortening because it was very stiff but the flavor was not there at all. It was strange to us that the entire cake wasn't frosted with cream cheese icing. \n\nThe blue birthday cake had the same tasteless frosting and the cake itself was just ok (think funfetti). The slices are massive (which for $12 they should be) but were relatively crumbly and some bites were dry. \n\nThe cafe au lait was served in a bowl with no handle and it was barely warm.\n\nWe came here on a Friday night around 8:30 pm and had to sit at the bar which was ok. We were attended to right away but I felt slightly rushed by the staff; they brought boxes for our cake before we were even finished and gave us a bill pretty quickly. They never asked how our food was or if they could get us anything else. We did order two gingerbread men for our children to eat later so we'll see how those taste. They were adorable. \n\nI feel like you're definitely paying more for the experience of this place than the quality of the food. For $50+ with tip for what we got, I would have expected better tasting desserts. I think we'll stick with the Flying Cupcake from now on.",

  "text": "I can't believe this company is still in business. They have changed their location but it appears to be the same business.  I've noticed there used to be a lot of terrible reviews that are now gone.  Some say that the posts were removed under threat of litigation.\n\nI feel morally compelled to say something. I hired JM Grove to convert my garage to a family room.  I got five estimates and JM Grove was the lowest.  I walked Justin through the entire project including the materials I wanted used (for example, I wanted the same sink and toilet as upstairs).  Justin agreed to everything and promised everything would be done as specified.\n\nI signed a contract and Justin insisted that all the details we discussed did not need to be included in the contract because I already told him everything in detail orally.  \n\nThe project started several weeks late.  The township permit office said it did not appear that JM Grove knew how to fill out the permit paperwork correctly.  I got involved and completed much of the paperwork and paid for the township fees (even through the fees should have been included in the contract).  The situation was so bad that the woman at the permit office suggested I go with a different contractor. However by that point I had already given a $5000 deposit that I knew I wouldn't get back if I fired them.  The work started about three months after I signed the contract.  \n\nWhen it came time to pick out materials, Justin said the price I paid only covered the cheapest materials and if I wanted better materials I had to pay extra.  For instance, I wanted a toilet around $200 (the same one I showed him) and Justin bought an American standard toilet for around $89 that was a different color than the sink and toilet I showed him (tan instead of white).  I ended up paying significantly more for adequate materials. Over a thousand dollars.  I took several jobs out of the contract such as the carpet because Justin was trying to charge a higher than reasonable amount.  For example,  I told Justin I needed a sub panel when I showed him the job. He said we didn't need to put the sub panel in the contract because his electrician may determine it's not needed. I told him that's fine but I would not pay extra for a sub panel.  Months later, Justin told me that if I didn't pay an extra $950 for a sub panel that he could not complete the job. I ended up hiring an electrician to install the sub panel for $600, and the average estimate I found was $650.  \n\nNext came the plumbing and HVAC issues.  Justin hired someone to do the plumbing and HVAC work but the sub-contractor only did the plumbing work. He said Justin did not pay him enough to do the HVAC and refused to come back.  All the sub-contractors said this was their first time working with Justin.  I got HVAC estimates and learned that Justin put the name of a plumber who gave him an estimate on my inspection paperwork.  I previously pointed out the error, and he told me directly it was corrected.  The township stopped work until the correct plumber came to the township building and paid licensing fees.  This became a big deal and the township inspector said he felt sorry for me but there wasn't much he could do.\n\nJustin subsequently hired some guys on Ebay to complete the HVAC work and the rest of the project.  He ended up only paying them half what was owed.  There was also a drywall subcontractor who Justin refused to pay.  \n\nI ended up hiring a different company to do all the finish work, because Justin wanted to use materials that I thought would make the job look cheap.  \n\nBy the end of the job, Justin said he underbid the job.  Throughout the project, he often said he ordered materials but they never showed up.  I ended up charging about $600 on a credit card to pay to finish the job.  In total, I paid about $1,800 out of pocket.\n\nFinally, it came time for me to pay the last check.  I had the drywall contractor, plumber and Ebay guys all asking me to pay them directly because they knew Justin would not pay them.  I told Justin I was going to write the check out to the contractors and he proceeded to send me a lot of angry emails and texts insisting that I do not do that. I'm an attorney, but I contacted my own attorney and determined that I had to pay Justin. I felt terrible since most of the contractors did not get their money.  \n\nI paid my bill minus the approximately $1,800.00 I had spent out of pocket.  Justin sued me.  Yup, he sued me for materials he did not supply.\n\nI proceeded to write a very long legal brief with many, many, many exhibits.  I showed up to court ready to show the judge that Justin was engaging in a fraudulent scheme.  Justin did not show up.  I reported him to the better business bureau and the PA Attorney General Office.  I believe he was engaged in fraud.  \n\nI am writing this post to warn other people.  This was a terrible experience and I hope to help others avoid the many hours of time and frustration I experienced.",

The tap list is constantly changing as well as their collection of cans and bottles. The bartenders are knowledgeable and will let you taste anything on tap. They can also recommend something new for you based upon what you usually drink. I like this option since I'm prone to order what I like to drink. \n\nThe Independent is connected to a cafe that offers coffee and tea, as well as salads, soups, sandwiches and shareable dishes. I've had so many things on this menu and I love all of them. The beer cheese and pretzel, cheese plate and sausage platter are delicious to share with company. As far as the sandwiches, the Grilled Indie is my absolute favorite thing on the menu, hands down. The Havana and the Rob are also very good. I prefer the side salad over the chips and it's worth trying! I don't even like blue cheese, and I like this side salad. \n\nParking is a bit odd but there's an abundance of it if you know where to look. There is parking in the back of the bar and along the Dollar Store directly next to the bar. Be careful when parking in the Dollar Store parking lot, though. If the Dollar Store is open within store hours, they will tow your car if left in their lot. There is also parking available across the street from the bar in the field that's fenced in. If you bike, there is a bike rack available. \n\nThe bar also has darts and a few board games.",

  "text": "My wife and I came here looking for a sofa and loveseat to purchase for our living room. We weren't looking for anything fancy, just something nice and affordable. Needless to say, Bob's Discount Furniture had the best deals of the all the places we checked out. We immediately found a comfortable sofa/loveseat that we liked, right within our price range. Some of the other places we visited cost nearly twice as much for a similar set! The sales associates were very friendly and helpful, without being pushy. The sofa did have to be back ordered, but they offered to deliver the loveseat by itself on an earlier date at no extra charge (which we declined), and both pieces were delivered right on time as promised. I can't yet speak to the lasting quality of the furniture, but my initial experience at Bob's has been nothing but positive.",

  "text": "Went to this target because frankly it's cleaner and nicer than Walmart, had a hand basket of food and miscellaneous items and put my carrier on the cashiers conveyer belt. When it arrived to the cashier, he, David, began throwing and dumping all of my stuff out?! I couldn't believe it! I guess, unknowingly that's a code sign for  battle. I asked if it was offensive to him that I had put my basket on his conveyer belt? I received no reply. I tried to think to myself how in the world that someone could misconstrue what I thought was a helpful act in such an aggressive manner. The man behind me had a hand basket as well...I warned him not to put the basket on the belt as apparently David found it offensive and his items would be quite roughly thrown out of it! I have friends who are cashiers and the appreciate it when a customer puts the hand basket of goodies on the conveyor. Say it's a bit easier. Not sure what the exact customer protocol is here, but I'm sure the cashier protocol wasn't appropriate.",

  "text": "Nice lady in the office that answers the phone, but terrible customer service otherwise.  Do not hire this company to service your pool.  They ruined my brand new pool in about 2 months.  Doug the technician was a grumpy guy that said uncalled for threats to me like, \"if a dust storm ever comes along and blows dirt into your pool, i'm done.\" I asked \"what do you mean done?\" and he said he would no longer work on my pool.  First of all, my pool is never dirty, and there is no threat of my RAISED pool yard being attacked by a dust storm filling the pool.  And he said something else along those lines threatening me....OKAY, so I started looking for a new technician, one that was going to help me, not threaten me, and when he tested my water he and one other 3rd party verified the extremely high levels of Cyanuric acid and said I need to drain my pool and start over.  Tucson pool confirmed my CYA levels were perfect when they started my pool service a couple of months ago. The water still LOOKS perfect too, but the CYA levels are unacceptably high now and they don't test for that on a regular basis as the technician would have to bring a water sample back to the office (and how would a consumer know to do this on their own or what it even is if you're paying for someone else to keep your water treated correctly) and it's unfortunately due to the type of chlorine tabs they use.  Just skip this company or else you will be sorry if you ever even realise how they ruined your crystal clear water with this invisible problem.  They also won't take any responsibility for the problem even though they confirmed the level was perfect when they started service and now is 3 times the recommended level.  They would not handle my issue in a professional manner when I called to speak to the owner, I talked to Lee who tried to blame it on someone else (God only knows who else could have done this!)  They could have made it right by re-imbursing me for the water bill I will now face to replace the water, but it looks like i'm screwed unless I win in small claims court.  DON'T TRUST THEM.  I am a Realtor and this company was recommended by a client who has crystal clear water, so they were also duped.  And they will no longer use them nor will any of the clients that ask me to refer them to my pool co of choice.",

Hey \"chef\" maybe if you weren't reheating day old prep... Just a thought from someone with a clue. Wine parings showed up after the food and were dropped at the table by dissappearing waiters with no explanation of varietal, region or vintage (yeah we asked to back track and find out what we were drinking, but should we have to?) We told the manager how terribly dissappointed we were with our entire experience, and oh hey SURPRISE she didn't care. Do not eat here.

Started well...seated immediately, drinks right away, order quickly taken.  One frittata with veggies, including onion.  Singling out the onion because you don't expect to have several slices of onion skin included, which this one did.   We compare it to something like finding a hair or two, just not quite as gross.\nAlso ordered bacon, egg, cheese sandwich with side of well done potatoes  Asked for eggs over medium but still runny.  Got eggs over well, nothing runny about them.  Normal potatoes, not well done.\n\nPointed out the pieces of onion to waitress who said she let her manager know.  We stuck around for several minutes but no manager came by to comment, apologize, or offer a discount.\nMaybe I'm expecting too much of today's managers.  They're too busy or lack the customer service training, or worse, they don't care?\nIf rating restaurant today, it would be a 3 1/2 star.",

  "text": "Seven Things to know about the Feast of the Seven Fishes Christmas Eve Dinner here:\n\nUno: Acqua e Farina (Water and Flour), owned by the same owners as Vecchia Osteria, is usually a pizza place, but for Christmas Eve, they transformed into a seafood lover's dream, and like, the number 7, we were lucky to be able to attend!\n\nDue: The menu was small (7 dishes, and actually 10 fishes!) but everything was delicious (yep, we ordered the whole menu for 4 people, and had a LOT of leftovers). Gluttony is clearly my family's favorite of the 7 deadly sins.\n\nTre: The menu included a calamari and fried smelts appetizer and two gigantic salads (arugula, shrimp, and octopus, and a salted cod and cauliflower salad), lobster ravioli (so good it was the only dish we didn't have leftovers of), a heaping portion of linguine de mare (clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp in spicy red sauce), lastly, a branzino with sauteed spinach and Chilean sea bass with tomatoes and toasted bread to dip (both incredible). For dessert they were out of cannoli but we had a delicious (and surprisingly light) limoncello vanilla cake (tiramisu and a chocolate cake were also available). We were so full, but basically in 7th Heaven.\n\nQuattro: The service was amazing- they coursed out the dishes for us since we were eating family style (definitely recommend doing so), and our waitress told us all about her family's Italian roots and traditions. We started with a complimentary roasted veggie appetizer, and finished with housemade chocolatecello on the house!\n\nCinque: It wasn't too crowded but they could accommodate parties as large as probably 7 at one table, maybe more. The restaurant can probably seat about 50 max. We called ahead to make a reservation.\n\nSei: The ambiance was lacking a little bit (bright lights and a pizza place with a big oven...) but we still had such a good time! \n\nSette: Don't forget to BYOB!\n\nIf you're looking to change up your Christmas Eve traditions (we're not actually Italian) or just trying to avoid cooking for your family on Christmas Eve, I highly recommend it! Buon Natale!",

  "text": "Every Wednesday night from May to September, Media, Pennsylvania hosts an event called Dining Under the Stars. State Street is closed down and each restaurant offers dinning outside under the lights. Media offers all genres of food such as Italian, Middle Eastern, Japanese and even Irish. This beautiful Wednesday night we chose my personal favorite, Spasso Italian Grill. We started off at the bar inside. We kept it very traditional. I ordered my usual extra Dirty martini w/ kettle and Steph ordered her usual Old fashioned w/ Makers. Before we could even finish our drinks we were being called for our table. Walking outside you get the full experience of dining under the stars. From the classical sounds of the Frank Sinatra performer to complimentary sidewalk chalk given to the children to entertain themselves while their parents enjoy a nice dinner.\n\nWe started off with the fried Calamari and the Tomato Bruschetta. The Fried Calamari batter was seasoned perfectly. I find restaurants often over season their batter because of their lack of knowledge on cooking seafood. Spasso did a really good job on allowing you to appreciate the actual taste of the Calamari. The Tomato Bruschetta was on point. The mozzarella was fresh. The Tomatoes were packed with flavor and the smoked salmon's pinch of fresh cracked black pepper was just enough.\n\nFor the main course I had Filet Mignon overtop a crispy Potato, dressed with Oscar sauce and crab meat. The crab meat alone could have been a small meal. The Oscar sauce poured over top was essential to the meal. It helped define the steak while giving the crispy potato a little more flavor. The Filet was cooked very well (medium), not too soft but didn't take much effort to cut.\n\nSteph had the classic chicken parm. Kind of hard to mess chicken parm up, spasso did not disappoint. Despite having a very large portion, the meal was still cooked with care and from the heart.\n\nBoth kept tradition going by ending our meal with coffee and baileys.\n\nLegitness 8.5\n\nPortion 8.3\n\nDisplay 8.2",

Service started out ok, but once the food was served, not by our waitresse, things went down hill from there.  She disappeared, I mean I saw her across the resturant, but she never came back to see if we wanted drink refills, or to see how the food was until we were almost done. The food was extremely salty, to the point  of not being edible. When she finally came over, I informed her, and while she offered to replace the food, I had at this point lost my appetite.  It was very frustrating.  Would I recommend this place I am not sure. I have had better service there, so I am not sure.  My date was bothered by the fact that the table was not clean.",

The manager gave us samples of a couple side choices, because I was having trouble deciding, which was great customer service. Staff was super friendly too. We also got a side of fries topped with Hot Chicken, which was on point! Those fries are a must. There's two types of BBQ sauce on the table, one a little spicier than the other but both had great flavor. Wish I lived here, I'd come here often.",

I love that they always post where the potatoes came from that they're using that day on a board outside of the kitchen. They are a little pricey, but I feel like they're a higher level of fast food, so it's totally worth it.\n\nMy go to is a \"Regular Fry\". They fill the cup up with fries, and then throw another scoop of fries in my bag. When I get back to work the bag is soaked with grease, and that just makes me even more excited to dig in (as horrible as that sounds). I make sure to fill a condiment cup with ketchup and I'm set!\n\nI have eaten their burgers before, but I don't eat red meat that often, so when I do indulge I add the green peppers and onions. So friggin delish. I may have to have it for lunch tomorrow.",

It was folding tables and folding chairs - like a picnic. My husbnd's knees were killing him after sitting in these very uncomfortable seats all evening. The food was served family style and I assumed this would provide significant quantities for the 22 adults at the dinner. My son is 6'4\" and is used to eating a fair amount at dinner. Although the food was quite delicious, the quantity left much to be desired. One of the \"large\" plates I chose was crab cakes - I assumed this would be 1-2 crab cakes per person but it was 1 small crab cake to be shared by 4 people. My guests didn't even know what to do when 1 crab cake was placed on the table for 4 people. Did everyone get a spoonful? For the price, my husband and I were very disappointed and embarrassed. This was the first time we were entertaining my son's new in-laws. I wish the event planner gave me an honest sense of the amount of food since I was doing all the planning via email/phone. Very embarrassing.",

When you first enter, there is a small market where you can buy artisan cheeses and if you keep walking past the market, that is where the restaurant is. The restaurant is super cute. We all got their signature cocktails which are delish so make sure when you eat here you try one of their drinks. After drinks were ordered, we got one of their charcuterie plates and their combo appetizer plate which included fried pickles, cheese stuffed onion rings, and their sweet and spicy chicken wings. Their sweet and spicy chicken wings were amazing - perfect blend of sweet and spicy. For entrees, my husband got their grilled cheese sandwich with avocado and bacon. The sides were tomato bisque soup and sweet potato fries. I got their fried brussels sprouts salad with fried prosciutto and goat cheese. Both dishes were amazing - the grilled cheese had thick slices of bacon and avocado, and the brussels sprouts were perfectly grilled and that fried prosciutto added the perfect crunchiness! If you're in the West Reading area, you gotta give this place a try, so worth it!",

It's a beautiful restaurant, classy designs, lots of natural wood, it's lovely! Our server was extremely kind and helpful, we always love a waiter willing to chat and joke around a little. We initially went for happy hour, got some delicious oysters (the happy hour deal is amazing- 75cents for a raw oyster!!!). We were so impressed that we decided to get 12 more oysters and share the Flammekuchen for dinner. The oysters were all around impressive and I highly recommend this place for happy hour and snacks! The flammekuchen was slightly disappointing for us. It's originally a thin crust pizza from the Alsace region of France and that's where we first were introduced to it. We expected it to have lots of cheese and appropriate toppings. It came out mostly onion and bacon, with a very small portion of cheese sprinkled on top. The flavors were good but it was TOO much onion. We were pretty sad about it, and it definitely lost the restaurant a star. However, if you love caramelized onions and bacon, you will likely love this!\n\nOverall this space is cute, convenient, and they have great happy hour deals! I hope that if we don't make it back by this trip, we will on a future trip because the entire menu was mouth-watering. Plus, it's hard to beat 75 cent oysters!",

They take tater tots which are already a gift from above, and take them to a whole new level. Also they fry up cauliflower and give you one of theost incredible sauces to dip it in. \n\nThen you get to the burgers. The meat is from the same providers of the meat for the St. Elmo's steakhouse. So you know it's good. But the creativity and combination of flavors for each of the burgers is brilliant. \n\nThe food may be pricey but this isn't the Trump University of burger restaurants.

Our room was extremely small, barely fit the 2 beds and the decor they use only makes it feel that much smaller and gawdy. It's also a very confusing casino hotel and incredibly easy to get lost and we were sober mind you and not the only people trying to figure there way around. Id hate to be hammered walking around this place, security must get a kick out of those people and good luck trying to find someone to help you navigate this place. It's very interesting to see wierd windows and doors off of the hallways and wierd little nooks here and there. It's like they kept expanding the hotel and didn't quite have a master plan with each addition. TV channels are limited unless you wanna drop 20 bucks on a movie...yeah not me! After we checked in we wandered to see the pools, one which was closed for renovations that we clearly couldn't see any type of Reno going on. With one pool closed it caused the other one to be packed full of heads, turning it into a giant cesspool. Think I'll pass on taking a dip. We asked one of the workers for a good spot to eat, they recommended Milan, I wanted the island buffet, but the line was forever long,  food was typical make sure you don't look behind your booth in the artificial greenery, it's packed full of dust, gum and old food. It hasn't been cleaned in months, great job health department! In all I find it funny so many people have rated this a great casino hotel for families with kids, it smells of smoke even in the non smoking rooms but I do realize I'm in Nevada and all casino hotels smell like this, they have tried to put air purifiers everywhere but it's not much help. In all  I wished we had stayed at the Grand Sierra, at least there pools were open, they have a movie theater and a bowling alley. This shit box has an arcade with expensive costs to play the games.

  "text": "I came because I had been searching for a Thai massage for a while. Thanks to Yelp I saw that MidCity wax and Spa does that and more! So I went ahead and booked a 90-minute Thai massage as well as a brow waxing. \n\nFrom beginning to end, Suzie was courteous and professional, doing everything she could to ensure my comfort. The online system wasn't allowing me to log on, so had to call and leave a message.  She immediately return my call. \n\nOn the day of my appointment she called again to confirm and got there early to ensure the room was comfortable before my arrival.\n\nMassage itself was everything I wanted and then some. It hurt in more places that I wanted, demonstrating how desperately my body needed the massage. And Thai massages are NOT for the faint of heart. As you're laying on the floor, getting pulled and yanked, I felt like my body was getting a work out. If I could hire Suzie to stretch me like that on a daily basis, I'm sure I'll grow a couple of inches by next year. \n\nThe waxing was also smooth and effortless. It didn't irritate my skin and I loved how painless that part was. \n\nBest of all, you get 20% off for checking in on Yelp. Love it when businesses show Yelp love!",

However, the place is quite overpriced for what it is, don't go by the prices on their website's menu (or rather add $7-10 to each entré).  The food is visually appealing, ingredients seemed good, and it tastes okay... okay is the problem. At this price range I don't expect just okay I expect great Mexican food and a good handle of spices and Mexican cooking techniques. If I'm paying $20 for an enchilada, then the sauce better be superb; I should exclaim \"oh my God!\"  Also skip the drinks. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which was just limeade. Nobody felt the slightest relaxation from drinking those. There are much, much better options at this price range in Tampa and saint Pete. If they charged $12-15 ave for an entree, I could possibly consider coming back, but not when the entrees average $20-30; it's just not worth it.  Sorry... this place is bougie for the sake of being bougie. \nNow for excellent Mexican food, it's always the no frills holes in the wall.

  "text": "I've had credit cards with Chase bank since 2007 following the institution's takeover of Washington Mutual in 2008. Last month I discovered the secondary credit card attached to \"my\" Chase credit account (issued in my grandson's name) was \"missing\" after the child's wallet was confiscated (later returned) by the Encinitas sheriff's department following a still pending dispute. Upon discovery of the missing card I immediately called Chase and \"cancelled\" the old card and was told (per website instruction) to notify ALL existing merchants if the billing information were to remain the same. (New account number issued/balance forwarded but old account closed for \"security\" reasons. Simple enough, you would think? But apparently this is not the case.)\n\nWhen reviewing my Chase account on 12/12/2017, I noticed a new charge for $39.99 (posted by LA fitness--my grandson had signed up for reoccurring billing prior to the credit card account being closed and balance reassigned) prompting me to file a single charge dispute. Two days later, another charge by LA Fitness (Encinitas location) ($19.98 also not authorized) was posted to which I called to file a second dispute. \n\nWhen I called Chase I was put in touch with the institution's fraud department (both calls routed through India call center) and was told the charges were related to the previous account (even though the account had been deactivated, closed and reassigned) and were therefore \"authorized\"! (What?! And by Whom?) When I explained that no new information to authorize billing had been forwarded to LA Fitness and that the new charges reflected since new account issuance had been reassigned were not authorized the representative could not understand! \n\nTen minutes later I called Chase back (800-945-2000 ext. \"0\") and asked for the newly assigned account to be placed on a temporary hold until the matter could be resolved. I reemphasized my reasons for WHY I was disputing both charges and informed the India consultants that I would be doing so in writing once Chase forwards the paperwork to explain why.  Pending HOW Chase handles this dispute will determine what action I follow up with, which could include taking this matter to federal court! (Since it's the banking industry and because it affects the general population it's seems fitting at this point.)\n\nWhile I'm waiting for a response from Chase anybody have any suggestions as to why Chase - or any credit card company for that matter - would take on other businesses contractual obligations and without both parties first consenting let alone being informed ? Is that even allowed?  F.Y.I. Amazon won't do it - their call center is also based out of India - so why would the banking industry take such a risk?\n\nCheck back..... I'll post updates or modify or change the 1 star review as events unfold....\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate 12/19/2017..... Called JP Morgan-Chase Bank USA N.A. fraud department yesterday and the problem was \"instantly\" resolved. The man on the phone pulled my account (with my permission) and immediately understood and transferred me to someone to reverse the unauthorized charges. They put a block on LA Fitness vendor and made sure my accounts were safe and not subject to future charges.\n\nShould you ever encounter difficulties or not be able to resolve a problem from Chase's India based customer service location I suggest calling the USA number (1-800 -432-3117).\n\nThank you gentleman working in Chase's Fraud department, I appreciate you looking out for my best interests! \n\n(F.Y.I. reason upgrade to 3-star review - first experience 1 star, updated experience 5+ star = 3+ stars.)",

I am thanking my lucky stars for that gift certificate, and especially that it was for Dream Dance.  Here I am now seven years later still taking lessons and loving it even more. My lessons are with Matt who is a wonderful dance teacher who somehow weaves a lot of fun into his lessons. Working with Matt and growing as a dancer has brought a lot of joy into my life. Whether you just want to learn to dance for the pleasure of dancing or want to compete....or even perform (thank you Zhenya for your beautiful choreography) you can find it at Dream Dance. It is a professionally run and fun studio and I would highly recommend it.",

I was automatically attracted to this Starbucks even though I passed 4 others because they have a drive through and it was freezing cold outside. I didn't realize that it would take forever to get my items. With 5 cars in front of me it took several minutes. Once I ordered they were out of cream cheese which is kind of annoying. You would think the buyer would order enough cream cheese to equal the amount of bagels, but no. And by the time I got my bagel it wasn't even really warm. My white chocolate mocha didn't taste right. I probably will not comeback unless it's another cold morning because when you pay $7 for 2 items that didn't come out right and take forever to make that's not acceptable.",

His aunt had read a review in a national magazine that raved about the pearl sugar waffle and she had to have it. \nIt was a weekend but the wait time was only about 30 minutes. Yes, on weekends there is a wait but when you have a delicious, steaming cup of absolutely perfect coffee and a serious pastry to munch on- time flies. I am not a fan of \"fancy\" food that throws together disparate flavors haphazardly in an attempt to be special or precious. Milktooth does not go there. Flavors are balanced. Food is hearty and real. Service is great. The experience left me looking forward to the chef and owner's dinner venture soon to open in my 'hood. Everyone, including aunt and uncle (who are gastronomes) loved it.\nWhy only four stars? Holy crap, this food is super rich.

The crab cakes were perfect.  My mother loved her vegetable pot pie and I enjoyed the shrimp creole.  If you want some delicious creme brûlée, then you better come here.  The wait staff paced our courses perfectly so that we never felt rushed or impatient.  I love that.  This is a beautifully restored mansion as well.  This would be a perfect spot for a romantic dinner!",

  "text": "They were very accommodating with room requests. The staff is super friendly and helpful and so polite when we utilized the room service. The food from the grill down stairs was excellent. The bathroom is very small and the blankets are very thin. The room did have an odd smell when the fan shuts off. We had an exterior room that faced the east, and it was pretty peaceful. Didn't hear much traffic noise. Heads up though, they require an extra $25 a day deposit that they charge immediately. This was something that we were completely blindsided by. Also, if you use the room service and want to charge to your room beside they understand that. The first night we ordered they charged to our card even though we asked to charge to the room. (That comes out of your deposit) check in and out is very simple and there is a tiny fridge in the room even though the room descriptions don't include that. There is a microwave at the end of the hall. The pool is in a big open area in the middle of the hotel and would be nicer if it was a little more private. Over all our stay was enjoyable and I would stay here again.",

I know, it's a chain restaurant and it can be pricey, but sometimes it feels good to indulge and not worry about prices or calories. \n\nI got a Long Island ice tea to drink, for only $7. Great deal! Wellll. The liquors listed are top shelf but I barely tasted alcohol. Doesn't anyone make strong drinks anymore? Bummer. \n\nLuckily, the food pleased me. \n\nThe biscuits are, of course, amazing. I ate 3 before our entrees came, and honestly could have had more. (Ha). \n\nI went for a triple item platter - lobster tail, salmon, and shrimp. It came with a salad and I upgraded my side to get the baked potato covered with mashed potatoes and sea food - omg it was so good. \n\nThe meat was wonderful, although too much butter was used for my preference on the lobster and shrimp. The salmon was AMAZING and had a delicious taste. The lobster tail was smaller than in the pictures, but that is to be expected I guess. It all smelled amazing and tasted amazing. \n\nService was incredible. Very friendly, prompt, and eager to please. Sent us home with 4 fresh biscuits. \n\nI definitely look forward to a return adventure.",

The latest visit was 2 months ago, and I will truly tell you that the quality of the seafood obviously declined in the past couple of years. The crab legs are thin and salted now, the same taste in many low price buffets. The oysters are smaller and not served as quickly as it was 2 to 3 years ago. People have to wait in line now because Minado tents to leave the oyster bar empty for a while before they reserving oysters. They used to serve tiger shrimps, but not any more.\n\nSushi bar is still good, fresh and tasty. However, it's now expensive to spend $33 dollars plus tips for just eating sushi. Most people come here for crab legs, oysters, and raw fishes, but again, they are not the same qualities 2 to 3 years ago. I won't stop going Minado, and wish them not only considering raising the prices but also the food qualities.",

Like the below review says, you don't realize just how good Dean's haircut is until a couple of days later, when all the salon hairdo is gone and you are left to do your hair normally. I have a strange texture for an Asian. It's wavy and textured in the front and side, then straight in the back. If cut and layered just right, I get this free easy wavy layered effect, but only if the layers are done right. Dean's haircuts left me with awesome natural waves, and I just have to wash and go to get it. He just know my hair. The second time he cut it, he did it under 30 minutes and I was frankly shocked and a little doubtful that he did it right. But I am sorry I doubted. His cuts are on point! He is also laid back and doesn't pressure you to upsell services like other hair dressers that I've seen do. Thanks, Dean! Happy New Year and I will be back I'm 3-4 months.",

  "text": "***CAUTION: DO NOT RENT FROM THESE SCAM ARTISTS!!*** I'm only giving this shady business one star because negative zero isn't an option. Had my fiance and I seen these reviews, we NEVER would've rented from them. Where do I start? From the beginning, Realty Corner false advertised their rental unit in their ad stating the home had granite countertops and stainless steel appliances...they were plastic. (Pssst! That's illegal, Realty Corner!) We let it slide because we loved the home so much. We moved in and next thing we know, the washer/dryer doesn't work properly. The law states that all advertised appliances in a rental unit must be in working order at the time of move-in. The heater was also blowing cold air and we moved in in December. So here we are in the middle of a snowstorm with no heat and me, my fiance and our little girl couldn't do our laundry. Luckily, my fiance does maintenance for a living, so after SEVERAL attempts to call, email and put in online work order requests and no response, HE took it upon himself to fix the heater. The dishwasher also was not working properly, so once again, my fiance had to flush the lines himself. After an unacceptable number of maintenance requests and a threat to report them to the Nevada Housing Division/ Tenant rights, did they finally come out and replace our washer/dryer. That was it. Great first impression of this horrible company! We stayed for two years and had nothing but problems with Realty Corner- now calling themselves \"PMI Nevada\". Chris, the maintenance manager has little to no regard for people's lives or privacy and lacks people skills something fierce. A quarterly inspection is conducted and they send you a letter TELLING you when it will be. Any request that they work around your schedule is useless. I work from home and requested they come on a day my fiance was off work and could be there, as I did not want to be home alone with a male stranger. This request was repeatedly never honored and Chris decided to show up anyway, causing my dog to bark and my customers to hear it over the phone, also leaving our garage door open after he left giving anyone access to our vehicles, personal belongings, tools and access to the inside of our house. Yes....all while I was working alone from home and did not realize the door was open until evening when my fiance returned home from work.  When you call to express your grievances, your concerns are met with snide, snarky comments and NOTHING is ever done to resolve these matters. The majority of our issues always stemmed from maintenance and Chris- who is clearly in the wrong field of work. Don't try to stop by their office to pay rent, ask questions or do any business with them- their office is never open. Not in the morning, not during lunch, not after lunch. You can't leave your rent in a drop box, because they haven't figured out a way to get people to stop vandalizing theirs (lol). So your only option is to pay rent through their online portal and they charge you $5.00 to do so. They will raise your rent, your sewer, trash and water without notice. Lastly, we always paid our rent on time. We took care of the house- we never even wore our shoes in the house in an attempt to keep the carpets clean and new.  We cleaned the house from top to bottom, including blinds, vents, baseboards, cob webs, steam cleaned the carpets, etc. We got $250 back of our $1,500+ deposit...basically our pet deposit. They charged us a LOCK CHANGE FEE AND AN \"ADMIN. FEE\" just for moving out- even though we returned the keys to them?! They nickel and dimed us for things like light bulb changes, a new coat of paint on the walls and nail holes, which is considered normal wear and tear. Considering we lived there 2 years, we should not have been charged for these things.. Get it together, Realty Corner/ PMI Nevada. You are going to be in a heap of legal trouble very soon! Renters/Buyers, beware! The internet is your friend...you've been warned.",

I called to ask about euthanasia and was told they perform it on birds.  I appreciate that they saw him right away.  I asked about putting him down as I didn't want him to experience the suffering he was going through.  The examined him and told me what was wrong with him, although the tech who greeted me agreed he was a very sick bird.  I asked about euthanasia and Dr. Gerstenfeld  refused saying that he would not put an animal down the first time he saw them, and needed to treat him.  They quilted me into a $270 bill, told me to buy a heat lamp and call them tomorrow.  They also quoted $250 just to euthanize an 8 oz. bird, not counting the cremation costs.  I paid for the treatment, went home, bought a heat lamp and two hours later, my bird passed away.  I would have rather paid for euthanasia and cremation, than worthless treatment.  I know my bird having lived with him for 35 years.  I have reflected on this before posting as I didn't want to post a negative review in anger and pain, BUT they are like many vets, looking for revenue first, rather then telling the client what really needs to be done.",

I ordered the grilled pork over vermicelli noodles.  The waitress brought out the fish sauce prior to my dish coming to the table.  The color was more red than any other place I have been to, and my wife sitting to my right indicated that she could smell the sauce from across the table (to my left).  It didn't smell bad, it just had a strong smell.  The portion of my dish was fine, and the addition of the fish sauce, made the flavor that much better.

He gets so excited when he realizes where we're going, and he can't wait to get inside, so I know they're treating him well and I don't worry at all about leaving him there. We only live about 5 minutes away, and he's usually asleep by the time we get home, even from just a half day of play. He's usually tired all day the next day too! They always offer to dry him off when I pick him up (his favorite thing to do there seems to be playing in the kiddie pools), which I appreciate. Their prices are reasonable compared to other dog daycares we've gone to, and it's definitely worth the money if you have an energetic pup! I also like that, unlike some dog daycares, they do have the half-day option.",

  "text": "I was a little disappointed given the aesthetics of this place is very pleasing and I had attended a work party here where the crab dip was very good & there was a lovely spread. \n\nFast forward 2 years and I used up a gift card I received almost last year. I made reservations on Open Table which was very convenient, and was sat immediately even though we arrived a little early. It was the day after Christmas and very slow. There was 1 other table occupied in the dining area when we arrived. The waitress was nice, but stopped coming to our table after we placed our order, which was a tad off-putting considering it was not busy at all.\n\nThe crab soup IS delicious! If you go here for anything, go for that. The bread they give you before the meals is also very good and a nice assortment (a seeded roll, corn bread, and another type of roll). I appreciate good bread. Move onto dinner and although my boyfriend thought his Pizzette was good (for $8 it was reasonably sized as well), my salmon was dry and overcooked. It was a big serving, but for the price, I'd expect a nicely cooked salmon. I needed to dip a lot of the lemon caper sauce to add moisture to it. I should have said something, but did not want to wait longer or waste the food. When I got it packed up to-go, the person who packed it up didn't bother to put any of the sauce in my container, which there was a lot of it on the plate. I ate it right when I got home as to not waste it or have it dry out even more the next time I heated it up. Overall, I might go back for drinks and that soup, but was unimpressed by the entree.",

We decided not to BYOB because we knew ahead of time the cocktail selection.  My Negroni and her Aperol Sprtiz were excellent and priced right.  My beef carpaccio appetizer was outstanding and served on a very cold plate, as it should be.  My niece loved her olives and pickled peppers.  The olive I snuck from her dish was outstanding.  My niece got the pasta with clams and she loved it.  The pasta (I can't remember what it's called but it was a twisted, solid bucatini-type pasta - no hole in the middle) with fungi is the best I've had outside of Italy.  Service was friendly, water glasses were filled often, and the pace was even and not rushed (they kept checking, surreptitiously, to be sure we were done).  My pizzelle were a tad sweet for my taste, but I managed to finish all 5 of them.  A definite repeat - with or without my niece!",

They will be confused for 15 minutes wave bagels around, bicker among themselves... then make the wrong thing three different times. Someone in line said I probably asked for too much from the staff (sarcasm),which I agree since they never made it correctly. Yes after 40 minutes still gave me the wrong thing. Again it wasn't busy, also the entire time I was there no breakfast sandwiches out at the registers, but there were 5 people hanging out talking. Also they rang it up incorrectly and the cashier was not pleasant and didn't fix it which caused MORE issues because it was such a difficult special order and I couldn't produce a receipt for what I ordered. The store was a mess as usual with people that looked homeless inside with bags and asking for money. When I contacted Wawa and complained they said someone would call. You can guess that they never bothered. Start making food at home. I sure am! Such a terrible eyesore to my neighborhood.",

Also, Dr. Nardone is a funny guy and helped keep me calm and comfortable during the extraction. \n\nI only had one tooth to get out, but had a bad experience during my lower extraction 8 years ago so was apprehensive. Turns out I had nothing to worry about!\n\nDuring the initial consultation, they showed me an informational video, answered my questions, and discussed options. Dr. Nardone really listened to my concerns and came up with a great solution!\n\nThe office was able to give me the estimate up front, and answered all my questions about how they bill out so I knew what to expect if the extraction was more difficult than anticipated. \n\nOn the day of, they were prepared and there was a very short wait. I opted to just do local anesthesia, which the Doc agreed with since I was just getting one. He said if at any point I felt uncomfortable or it got more complicated we could switch over to general. Fortunately, it was the fastest procedure ever! My tooth was out before I even realized he had made an incision! It was really exciting actually. (Yes, my tooth extraction was exciting...)\n\nThey were really clear about follow up care, and gave me 2 prescriptions so I could start with the mild painkillers but could go get the stronger ones if needed without having to come back. My follow up appointment was a week later and he said it was healing perfectly! \n\nI really appreciated the care of Dr. Nardone and definitely recommend going to him for your extraction needs. \n\nI also appreciated that the office was well prepared, and that the were so up front with fees and helped me plan since it's a large expense. \n\nAnd most importantly, no more wisdom tooth pain!",

We were not expecting that but price was regular hour if you ask me. My french martini was $11 during hh. We got the crab cakes on happy hour menu for half the price. They were so GOOD. If I had to do it over again would just order a white wine and crab cakes. \n\nIt took forever for our chicken, potatos and spinach to come out. Spinach was super good too. Customer service was good. Wasn't a wait on Sunday night and parking is pretty good and valet is also an option. \n\nNice music and love the wine bottles as decor. \n\nThinking of bringing my picky auntie here for her bday. If I am bringing her here, I must really think highly of this place.",

I came in later for my appointment and was handed a water bottle and an assortment of colors to choose from. The owner called me by name and totally agreed and understood when I told him I needed to give my nails a break so I just needed a good manicure to fix them up a little. Very kind couple (owners I believe) and very relaxed atmosphere that really makes you feel at home. My nails looks and feel great. I will be back for sure!! (With an appointment of course )",

The cheese empendada was cooked perfectly and stuffed full of rich cheese, but was paired with a bitter kale salad... It needed a sauce to cut the richness.  The plantains were cooked well, but the relish with which it was served didn't quite work.

This is creole Mexican, and as such must be judged as a different breed entirely. I walked in without specific expectations, and therefore was not disappointed. \n\nI ordered the three amigos nachos without cheese or yogurt. The server, hinting that the dish might be boring without the dairy, offered to have guacamole added in place of the cheese, so I said sure. I kinda regret that because they ended up dousing the chips in an ungodly cascade of guac, but hey, it was my own fault, and I did manage to remove some and thus locate the other components. The tofu was smoky and delicious and the salsa was quite tasty. The beans, as well, had good flavor. \n\nAnd did I mention the portion size? This mountain of chips and toppings was a thing of beauty--nothing short of epic. I barely finished half! Prices are super low for what you get: only 7.25 for my meal!\n\nSo bring your appetite, leave your usual standards for Mexican cuisine at the door, and you'll probably go home happy.",

I actually pay two weeks in advance to eliminate late fees, gives them ample time to process my check, since they do not have epay, direct electronic payment from my on line bank.\n\nSo it is a constant dispute monthly about extra charges and raising rates not as advertise pricing.

The prices are a bit steep, but you're also paying for the experience. \n\nThe support staff who helped wait on us were all great - refilled our drinks, brought our salad and soup promptly and made sure we had everything we needed.\n\nSomething to keep in mind - if you do hibachi and your party is fewer than 8, you may be sat with another party or two. It's not bad (depending on who you're sat with), just something to know!\n\nWe came here right before seeing a show at the AMC in Plymouth Meeting, and it was perfect! We would be back.",

The breakfast salad looked extremely good, and quite large! \n\nI did put down one of their fresh juices that was super delicious and a soy latte that got my own juices flowing!\n\nThe layout is open and modern and the internet worked great for us! \nThis is the type of place I could see myself buying one of their unlimited drip coffees and working from the whole day!\n\nStaff was super smiley and nice!

On top of that, my windshield wipers were ripped off going through the exterior wash. No one bothered to inform us this occurred, but I heard through an employee's radio that something happened with the wipers. When I asked an employee if everything was ok, she responded that the wipers were reattached, but I later discovered only one was put back on and it was completely broken.

I had a two questions about the menu which had to be asked to another server than the cook in the back. Being a vegetarian and not having the veggie patties was pretty disappointing! After paying I was told they weren't able to accommodate and I would need a refund and repay the refund was given and than when I tried to pay the server said it went through I tried to argue that didn't happen. At my seat I was then approached and asked not to sit there and that the order wasn't paid for (no surprise I tried to tell them that the first time) overall a very simple question and order (gluten free bun for a celiac and no bacon) was over complicated unnecessarily. I would understand if there was a line up but we were the only new customers there! Once we receive our order it looked great but nothing past that sadly! The burger was okay (if you've tried burger priest patties this would not be up to par). They need to try the gluten free bun there's a lot of better choices and as for the mac n cheese it was MEH I could've made it better at home disappointedly I was hoping for a savoury, cheesy good time! High expectations and low delivery but as for the milkshakes I will give them a second chance as it could be the one thing worth it to go!",

Drove all the way from N Wesley Chapel to try it when we were on vacation as we had purchased a restaurant.com coupon for $25 off $50. After we sat we saw a big poster stating they don't accept them because they changed owners. We stayed anyway since we had driven all that way and the waitress seemed nice even though she couldn't really speak English very well.\nBIG mistake, cannot even believe how bad it was. Flavorless food and all cold. Very literally reheated bacon that was old from the morning as you could see the white from the dried grease. Just microwaved it and then let it sit to harden and I mean it was like biting into hard nuts if you can picture that. Should never have been served even if it is new kid cooking because of new ownership.\nOwner yelled at the staff about the food in front of everyone so that was awkward. No compensation, even a free coffee offered. Very high pricing for what it was especially. We then walked to our car through a cloud of smoke from the owners relative sitting on the sidewalk on the side of the building so that was the final cherry on the cake.",

  "text": "Milestone birthday called for a special dinner party for 11.  Dominic's couldn't have been more helpful from the first phone call.  Reserved a space right in front of their private room (which was booked) and we really had our own section of the dining room to ourselves.  We brought flower arrangements and a birthday cake in ahead of time and they took great care of setting it all up.  Our waiter, Emiljo, was superb at handling all drink and appetizer orders, without rushing us as we took our time getting settled.  And the food...was just flawless.  Toasted ravioli and calamari starters were hot fresh and crisp, with a subtle marinara that didn't overpower the foods' flavors.  House salads were crisp and fresh and the vinaigrette with a hint of lemon was just right.  Entrees were equally well prepared, from my delicious Tenderloin Brochette, my partner's Pasta Primavera, several Veal Chops around the table, steak, chicken parm, etc.  All superbly done! To top it all off, when the birthday cake was presented to the guest of honor, then taken back to the kitchen to be cut and served, the owner sang a lovely Italian serenade to my sister, who had the birthday of her life on this perfect evening.  You won't go wrong at Dominic's , whatever the occasion.  Complete 5 star experience!",

  "text": "My entire pregnancy/maternity experience was excellent. From my prenatal care at Temple Northeastern with Nurse Amanda and Dr. Herrine (and amazing staff) to ultrasounds in the fetal center with the amazing technicians and Keisha (non-stress test tech) to my actual labor and delivery with the amazing Dr. Martin, Dr. Pantoja, Dr. Kylee, Nurse Sylvia, Nurse Linda, Nurse Jody, Nurse Jaime, Dr. Kylee and every single nurse, doctor, resident and student who made us a priority....we can't thank you enough. Everyone who works for the OBGYN, fetal center and labor/delivery absolutely LOVE what they do. It shows. If you want to go natural then they support you, which they did for me. Because my son was estimated to be larger, I had to have a c-section but wasn't pressured at all. My husband and I were informed of all the details and were left to make whatever decision we felt was best. Everyone on staff was so supportive and encouraging (I went in early for induction and didn't dilate for 2 days straight). Many times Temple can get a bad reputation but this was NOT my experience. I will have all of my children at Temple as long as I am living in Philadelphia. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my experience a wonderful one!!!",

  "text": "I met Mega while on vacation in 1998.  I was in the throes of an MS episode that flared up from my trip across the country.  Having never experienced energy work at that time, I gave it a go.  Needless to say, I found immediate physical relief but more importantly it began my journey to self healing in a significant way.   Proudly, I am free of MS today and have been for 17 years (diet change, healing work both emotional and physical were part of the routine).  Over nearly 20 years, I have worked intermittently with Mega and other healers to help clear deep layers of emotional and spiritual wounds that led to dis-ease in my body.    It is my firm belief that no one heals without their own commitment to doing so, leaning on someone for a miracle is not the way out.   This is a principal that Mega clearly shares with me.   She is grounded (which is not always easy to find in a healer), she is VERY skilled (and I have been to many people), she is deeply caring, she just IS magnificent.   I am sincerely blessed to have found Mega on my path.",

I had booked my movie ticket online long back and when i went at the ticket counter the girl who was assisting me she was literally saying that due to some reason we are not showing the movie and she asked me for the refund and she gave me the refund as a gift card  then i got doubt so went to next counter and asked for the movie ticket which i went to watch that guy gave me the ticket. I dont whats wrong with that girl, literally infront of me for 4 people she lied that we are not playing this movie and sent them back. She dont even have that much of sense that people travel from so far with family and friends to watch movie and spent some time.  Heartless girl seriously i dont want to take out her name in this message. Atleast if she reads this review  she wont repeat this things again.

  "text": "TERRIBLE service ruined the meal entirely. Our main waiter took our order and then never once did he come back to the table, despite the fact that after 45 minutes we still had no food and needed drink refills. He was checking on other tables around us, but he wouldn't even look at us. The second waiter (Rhett or Brett?) was trying his best, he brought us a second round of drinks and finally brought our food. My husband and I split a burger, each of our kids had pasta, and our granddaughter had fried fish. Our $18 burger and fries were stone cold, completely inedible (this should have been that big, delicious burger you can only get at a bistro). The two pasta dishes were both terrible - the Shrimp & Angel hair Pasta was bland and tasteless, and the Pasta Jambalaya was just gross, it tasted awful. My granddaughter's fried speckled trout was actually delicious. We sent the burger back and waited, and waited, and waited some more. Keep in mind, our main waiter could see all of this unfolding the entire time and still never approached us. Finally we asked to speak to the manager, he didn't seem too concerned and he never apologized, just said he would \"go find our burger.\" After another 15 min or so, we got up to leave and the manager finally showed up with our burger. By this point we didn't even care. Finally, the manager became apologetic and offered to comp our meal, he boxed up our burger to go. After two hours of waiting in a beautiful restaurant, my husband and I ended up hurriedly eating our burger in an Uber on the way to City Park. We will NEVER go back, nor recommend it to anyone. We live just a couple of hours from NOLA and visit frequently; in a city with so many fabulous places to eat, why would we ever give our business to a restaurant that treated us so poorly?",

  "text": "I had my car serviced here. Just an oil change which included a car wash and for a nominal fee a tire rotation.  When I picked up my car I noticed it wasn't washed which didn't bother me, but then I started wondering what other services were not done and it looks like the tire rotation wasn't done either. I called Bryan my the service advisor and he said that a 3 tire cross rotation was done (impossible by the way) and to bring my car in this weekend to have it detailed.  After speaking with his manager Richard Phelps I opted to take Bryan up on the offer, but Bryan now said it would have to be either Tuesday through Friday or 7a Saturday morning, none of which worked for me, and so it was an empty gesture. I would think twice about letting them work on your car. They're untrustworthy and dishonest at worst. \n\nUpdate: I took them up on the offer to detail my car and rotate my tires. Overall the job is satisfactory and I will not nit pick the small stuff, but they did forget one major thing that I noticed as I was about to pull away. The picture speaks for itself.  Good thing the windshield wiper was on the dash and it was a sunny day otherwise it could have been dangerous for me. As a result, my rating stays.",

Leading with this in mind, I thought the Carmel Christkindlmarkt did a fantastic job of creating a cozy and warm environment on the plaza of the Palladium. The German wooden booths combined with the ice skating rink in the center, raclette sandwich booth with Amelia's baguettes, gingerbread, hot cocoa, mulled Guhlwein, brats and sauerkraut from Joe's Butcher Shop and festive decor makes for a lovely winter wonderland. I loved seeing the integration of several Hoosier businesses like X'Chocal Art, Joe's Butcher Shop, Winzerwald Winery and Urban Chalkboard. Carmel has had an impressive increase in local and diverse businesses in the last few years and this event offered a taste of that.  I imagine next year they will spread out the space and add more food vendors to help with the flow and wait lines for eats and drinks. \n\nMy only complaint would be the placement of the porta potties and the proximity of the smell to the funsies. All learnings for next year. Great work!",

In regards to the seating, there are perhaps 4 small tabletops, 1 large communal style table that seats around 20, and a long bar style seating area for around 10 persons.  We were able to procure a small table for the two of us.  \n\nMy wife ordered our dishes: the Johnny Ham Hands and the large size option for the Gravy Train dish.  The smaller size for the Gravy Train would have been enough, as we only ate half of the dish.  Both dishes were okay, nothing special that would warrant our return to the restaurant, since there are closer options to where we live.

We shared the Buratta Toast and the Calamari, both were superb.  I wasn't crazy about the bread that was brought to the table, it was more of a whole grain bread instead of a baguette, but not a big deal.  We shared the table side Caesar salad, as our server made the salad he told us a funny story.  Good dinner theater, we laughed.  I had a braised Lamb Shank finished with Au Jus for dinner.  I didn't need a knife, so tender.  Absolutely wonderful.  My wife had the Veal Saltimbocca and our guest had a fish special.  All entrees were excellent.  We opted to share two desserts, and our server graced us with a complimentary round of limoncello.  I forgot to mention that we ordered a nice bottle of wine that our server had suggested.  We had a great experience and look forward to going back again soon!",

The environment is quirky, artsy, and wonderful. The waiter was attentive and informative. We had a great time. The bill came out to $61 and was well worth it. We even had leftovers for another meal. The meals were all cooked well and the cornbread and salads kept us happy until the courses/appetizers came. Alligator cheesecake is a must! It's not the standard cream cheese cheesecake but is more like a quiche. But...my favorite meal here was the jambalaya. The flavor was complex and the consistency was perfect (the rice was fluffy, not soggy). It had a nice refreshing zest too it as well as a deep savory flavor.",

  "text": "Overall I had a fun experience here, in this unassuming strip mall storefront that opens out into a very nicely furnished pub area. It's not what you expect from the outside at all - the menu is actually upscale (as are the beer selections). Wouldn't hurt if they could update the building exterior. Maybe add a nicer-looking sign from the highway. Little things.\n\nThe food, a strong 4.5 stars. My friends had good reports back about crab chowder and the crab enchilada special. While in the middle of my two delicious beers I lit into the special burger of the day, which came with bacon, Gorgonzola, mushroom gravy, and something else I forget. I asked rare, it came out nice and just on the medium rare side of rare, which is really what I wanted. Heck, Courtney (our waitress) asked if I wanted it Pittsburgh rare (similar to \"blue\"), and so I bet they will do whatever you ask.\n\nSide note: Courtney was awesome. She was a great sport and took everything in stride. She made me feel like the only patron even as she waited on my other 10 friends and other tables. I did have to ask for her once or twice but heck, that's life in a popular establishment. She got all of our orders right, only forgetting one beer on the evening (but not charging for it, and it wasn't mine so who cares!). Kudos to Courtney. If you know her, remind her about The Fest in Gainesville.\n\nAnyway, if I can point to one main culprit for the slide to four stars, it's dessert. I had my heart set on the caramel cake, but apparently it was discontinued (Courtney mentioned that they should remove it from the menu, so it seemed like more than just being out). I tried the chocolate stout ice cream and it was unfortunately sitting in a sea of liquid. The texture of the remaining ice cream was rather icy. The other ice cream ordered did not appear to have these problems, so I'm inclined to blame it on the alcohol from the beer, but TSP may want to check their freezer temperature just in case. Food prices are a bit high but not outrageous enough for a star deduction, not to mention beer prices were very reasonable for the craft selections.",

How do you run a business like this ?!\n\nI encouraged everyone to fill out one of the survey cards I saw on the wall.

See attached pic \n\nWe all detest insurance companies.  And having this business to be our designated lab, is a slap in the face. \n\nI know this isn't an exception At this Bryn Mawr location, as everyone I asked has had the same experience. \n\nIf anyone is reading this, please address and send this woman some HELP!!!!",

  "text": "After living in Vegas for a while, my boba standards have become a bit higher; this place does just the trick. My problem with Reno boba is that their boba is not that chewy! They're usually on the firmer side, but Bubble Tea Station Café have perfected their tapioca pearls. The pearls are the right amount of chewy and gooey, making them have a great bite. \n\nNow for their drinks, they are delicious! The honeydew snow is very flavorful and you can really taste the fruitiness of it. The Thai tea is also good; the only complaint I had with this drink is that it tasted a bit watered down. I'm sure it was a fluke in the making of the drink, and I'll be sure to update my post the next time I have this drink.\n\nWhat I also like about this boba spot is that you can adjust the sweetness of their drinks! All of the Vegas boba spots have this as an option, so it's great to finally see this option in the Reno/Sparks area.\n\nThey also have a variety of sweet treats, from the Filipino Casava cake to Baklava. I wasn't able to try any of these at this time, but they all looked delicious!",

  "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this museum particularly because of the Nick Cave exhibit. I've never heard of this particular artist before but I'm glad I stopped in because he has some really colorful pieces. The museum is easy to find with ample parking, however there is a charge for their lot. I paid $3, arriving around 4:00 and staying until closing. The World War I exhibit is on the first level and it's pretty extensive. This might be the first museum I've visited where the 70% of the museum is dedicated to World War I Art. It got pretty boring for me since I'm not into World War I art but did enjoy seeing their small contribution of two pieces of artwork to the Harlem Hellfighters. They could've covered more of that but I digress. The upstairs seems to be reserved for Special Exhibitions which in this case was Nick Cave. The building is so huge that I wish there was more exhibits on display. There appears to be another section of the building that is closed off, going down the hall on the first floor. Not sure if there's something on that side used for rental spaces or offices but I do think the building is underutilized. They also have a cafe which unfortunately I did not visit. As long as they continue to have more interesting exhibits like Nick Cave, I'll keep coming back whenever I'm in town.",

This was my first time here and I found this cool gem thru Yelp of course!\n\nThe restaurant was easy to find and it looks like they are doing some remodeling.  Couple of the positives that stuck out the most to me were: \n\nService: quick, fast, and super friendly \nFood: great prices, portion, delicious food\nValue: $9 for 12 dozen oysters? Where do I sign? \n\nOur favorites were the crawfish tails, calamari, gumbo, and oyster poboy, I will definitely order these in my next visit back. I was really pleased with the quality of food and the prices since some seafood joints tend to be on the pricier side, will definitely be back!",

Once i opened up my food I realized my fries were all over the bag spilled and the falafel sandwich turned out to be some sort of falafel burrito. The falafels were horrible cold and flavorless and the other ingredients added no flavor to the meal. Overall i wish i had never made this order save yourself the time and money",

Lots of live shellfish, very reasonable prices, and just a great vibe and atmosphere.\n\nExpect a wait, but as long as you're not concerned about how shellfish goes from being alive to on your plate, that time will pass quickly as you watch the master butcher win time and time again against whatever poor foe is next on the ticket. \n\nThe food is very lightly seasoned -- only simple stuff like salt, oil, or butter, but with seafood this fresh and at the prices they charge, it won't make a difference to your taste buds. \n\nFor two, we did the live uni/scallops, clam chowder, rock crab, and coconut shrimp. Filled us to our bellies, and we had so much shellfish I might develop an allergy. \n\nAdd to it that the staff is super friendly and very into it. Drop by, have fun, and have some amazingly fresh seafood. Will go again (tomorrow morning, in fact)!",

There were three instructors with about 20 of us.  I heard one instructor didn't have much personality but I didn't work with him I had another who was quite the character.

Problem came in when I was told by my account manager I could cancel my membership at any time when I signed up. Time came where I wasn't able to continue membership and called to cancel, I was told then that they require 30 days notice and I have to come into the club to cancel. I told them this is not what I was told previously and they basically told me tough, it's in the fine print of the contract you signed.\nFast forward three months, I've sent five-six emails to cancel and 3-4 phone calls as well and they're still trying to charge my card and sending my emails and calls that I owe over $1000 for a membership I have been trying to cancel for three months- note- at this point I still had not had time to go to the club to cancel in person, hence why I wanted to cancel in the first place.\nI finally make it into the club to speak with a manager who was very understanding and empathetic and said he would try to help get my account credited as much as possible and some sort of reduction to cancel, I said given the circumstance and what I was told by the Lifetime Account manager it would be fair to split the difference and I will pay a half month of dues to cancel. He agreed and said he'd try to get that approved.\nI was still getting notices via email and finally received one offering one months dues- $314 to bring account current and continue membership. I responded that I cannot continue membership at this point but I would be willing to pay half month and cancel membership now.\nThe customer retention rep told me the best he could do would be me to pay $225 over the next two months and then in 60 days if I still want to cancel I can cancel then.....\nI've been trying to cancel this membership for three months! Last thing I want to do is prolong this anymore!\n\nTake this story and use it as you wish, really a great place just unbelievable this experience. \n\nReally too bad, I would've loved to return to Lifetime when circumstances changed but with this treatment and experience, I never will...",

  "text": "This place loves that is has a dive bar reputation. I was here for two different events that they hosted and talk about thinking outside of the box. The first time I was at The Hideaway was for their third Tuesday of the month Meat Bingo. Yes, the prizes are meat. This night the place was packed, but it did not stop the fun. If you decide to go, go early. The bartenders kept the drinks flowing and everyone was happy. They have a great selection of liquors to chose from, plus this was an evening that Urban Chestnut sponsored and I think the crowd drank them out of their beer. The next time I was at the Hideaway for was a wine and pizza pairing. This event was a little tamer, around 30 people was guided through a wine tasting with prosseco, chardonnay, pinot noir, cab sav and finished with the best moscato I have ever sampled. We were served bite size samples of breakfast pizza, chicken alfredo, meat, nacho and finally dessert pizza (which this one was made by the owners). We met the owners Sam and Gracie. What a fun and engaging couple. You can tell they love the bar. We talked with them about future pairings....please please do a vodka pairing.",

  "text": "Gave this place 1 star, but if could go minus, it would be -10 or lower. 1st appointment (scheduled ahead) no one there to do 60 minute special. After 10 minutes of waiting a man came in door, didn't bother with pretense of washing hands. I lost 10 minutes on an hour service. Thought would give a second chance, again scheduled a 60 minute service a day in advance. Only 1 person when I arrive, and she spoke no english. NONE. I pointed to the service I wanted, she motioned me to a chaise and made phone call. 15 minutes later still waiting. Got up, showed the employee I was leaving & she quickly made a phone call and put me on the phone. The woman on phone said she would tell the employee what to do and did agree to add 15 min on todays service(12-29-2017) to compensate. I had scheduled for 60 minute special - 45 min reflexology foot/back, 15 min head, shoulder, arms. The employee rubbed my feet for an hour. No head, shoulder, arms. It was useless to try to communicate as she had no understanding of anything I said. BTW - BOTH  times there was no one in the building except for me and 1 employee the entire time. No one came in for a massage and no phone calls. It was very odd, as the other reflexology places I frequent nearby usually have people in lobby waiting their turn as well as incoming phone calls to schedule an appointment. Worst foot rub ever had. Should have followed my instinct and left. These people opened 2 places. 1.Kolb/Broadwy. 2. Kolb/Golf Links. May Kolb/Golf Links is staffed and run better. Or NOT.  Save your $$ and time and go elsewhere. A parting thought: Why would this business have only 1 employee who literally speaks no english???",

  "text": "I ended up here because of a snotty cab driver on the evening American Airlines tried to ruin my life...My flight home was cancelled and I was pissed. I grab a cab from the airport and say I want to go to my hotel. To which the cab driver replies, \"do you realize we wait three to four hours for a fare and you only want to go xx miles?\" So after some back and forth I say he can take me to one of the best restaurants in St. Louis if that's more to his liking. I imagine he took me here because 1. It is a fantastic restaurant and 2. The cab fare was close to $60.\nAs for the restaurant; it really is phenomenal Italian cuisine. The restaurant is in an adorable Italian area (think Boston's North End but smaller). The restaurant is very old school Italian feeling and I loved the dark, plush decor, and the Christmas decorations did much to bolster my black mood. \nThe service was excellent. I had a drink at the bar while I waited for a table. I was afraid I'd be waiting a long time on a Friday night, but I only waited as long as a glass of wine took to drink (not long).\nI usually pass on bread but I almost ate the entire basket. It was so fresh and so delicious; don't skip out on the bread here. They had French Onion soup as a special tonight and it was probably the best French onion soup I've ever eaten. For dinner I had chicken lemonota and it was one of the best lemon chicken dishes I've ever had. I ordered a side of pasta since all pasta is made in house. The pasta itself was good but I regretted getting the garlic and olive oil sauce. It was so crazy spicy I started sweating and I live in the south where we pour hot sauce on damn near everything. If I could go back in time, I'd caution myself and insist I order Alfredo or red sauce. So maybe also heed this warning when you go. Unless you enjoy having your taste buds burned off your tongue. \nI ordered cannoli for dessert which was definitely fresh and pretty tasty if not the best I've ever had it was still good!\nI would highly recommend this restaurant. It really was one of the best dining experiences I've had in this city and the food is just absolutely delicious. The price is also fair. My bill for all the food I mentioned was $55 which seems like a steal considering how fancy the restaurant is and how delicious and wonderfully prepared the dishes are.",

There were 11 people joining us this afternoon so we had plenty of room once we got to our fishing spot. \n\nWe used the boat's poles and they gave us a a quick tutorial of how to catch some fish. We stayed out for 2 hours and they moved the boat as soon as we stopped catching fish. \n\nIt takes an hour to get to the spot and an hour to get back. So, sit back on the top floor and catch tom rays or grab some food and a drink so you have plenty of strength to reel in those big ones you catch. \n\nWe caught 4 kinds of fish - bass, white grunt, snapper and perch. router we wanted. We were looking for that grouper but when we got back we saw the boat beside us caught the gWhen we got back they cleaned them for a small fee. There are 2 local places in the same marina that will cook up what you caught. One is a 'dinner' and one is 'tacos.' That way if you don't really like that fish smell you don't have to take it home with you other than what you get on you while actually fishing. \n\nWhich brings me to say you can get as messy or stay as clean as you want. There is staff available to take the fish off the lines and bait your hook if you want. I opted to bait my own hook but given the lack of pliers I let others remove my fish. That was also for my own safety as well as everyone else around me. Those fish start shaking back and forth and you can catch your hook in someone skin WAY TOO EASILY. So since I wanted to avoid that I just let Boomer remove the hooks from the fish. \n\nWe had a wonderful time. The price was right. We checked into other days and they do fill up completely on certain days so check online and give them a call and schedule ahead of time to make sure you don't miss out on this fun time. \n\nAnd if one of you likes fishing and the other doesn't, thats ok! You can stay up top and catch even more sun and listen to the gleeful fisherman below you.",

I was a bit confused how pack it was everyone just jumbo up at the bar waiting for a drink. Then 15mins later suddenly the crowds had somewhat broken up and no one on the other of the bar waiting. The flow of the crowds comes and goes. The bar tender was on a mission. She looked intimidating not much people approach her for drinks since she was so fast getting mix's out. She didn't bother to look up. We just happen to stand at a corner bar and a waitress approached us for drink orders. Yes for the price $12 a cocktails I expected to be stronger it tasted just like juice. \nGood luck grabbing that booth seats. Only way you will get one is literally waiting, hanging around in front of the table that your waiting on. Very limited seatings. This place is a really cool place for lounging. Grab a drink place.",

My personal favorite is the turkey leg, but others in my group have loved the fried chicken, ribs, turkey meatloaf special, and bologna.  Sides are all solid - cauliflower, Mac & cheese are two favs. Second is the passionate and friendly people who work there and want you to enjoy your meal. Owner / chef Rick gets a ton of credit for creating the right culture!  Third is the setting.  Warm and friendly with plenty of seating. Fourth is the prices which are reasonable.  Fifth is the fact they are constantly experimenting. Whether it be a few new dishes in 2018, to adding a catering menu.\n\nThis is a must visit place for those who live in or visit stl.",

I mean the slaw was ok of you like very tiny pieces for slaw and more on the creamy side. but if you put the spice rub on the slaw it is a very nice touch.  the fried potatoes which was a premium side that cost an extra was in my opinion  bits of French fries cut up with some sautéed onion and a dash of spice rub and the serving side was extremely small. when I picture fried potatoes I image slices potatoes fried in oil with onions.",

  "text": "My ongoing saga for good, mildly authentic Korean food in Philly continues as I attempted Southgate a few months back (listen, 2017 was a hard year!). Now, I have -never- had success with any place that sells both fried chicken and bibimbap, but you have to give everyone a fighting chance.\n\nThat being said, my boyfriend and I dined al fresco on the tiny streets of Grad Hospital with a soy garlic happy hour appetizer, which were appropriately crunchy and sweet. The only fault was the whopping 3 wings on the plate for the price, but I'm not bitter considering the atmosphere. I also urged him to try out soju, so we split a bottle of Cham, or I guess it's Charm...romanization is weird. I've never had this brand out of the US but it's like a cross between Choeum Cheoreom and Chamiseul: not bad, not great.\n\nOnto the entrees. I gave into the temptation of a steak dolsot bibimbap while my boyfriend bravely (read: naively) ordered jajjangmyun. The bibimbap was about what I expected, but I respect no establishment that doesn't give me the bottle of bibimbap sauce because it needed way more than what they gave me. The jajjangmyun was as disappointing as expected, with hardly any noodles, the sauce on the bottom, and the bonchan used as a garnish (and not even all that nicely). The flavor was kind of there but meh, needed salt.\n\nHopefully Southgate has improved over the months, since this was in August. I'll be back soon!",

To save time we placed our order online, and I appreciate that they have a good, comprehensive ordering system. Despite saying they were set up to do deliveries, there was a note online that this location is not yet delivering - just a heads up, as I'm sure it's related to being a new location and I can understand that it can take a bit to sort out the logistics of delivering food after just opening. I didn't ask for any customizations on my Italian grinder except that there be no bell peppers. There wasn't a specific check box for that (although there were specific check boxes for things like no onions) so I wrote it in the special instructions, but they still included the bell peppers, so that's why I took one star off. Otherwise, the sandwich was good and fresh, and definitely hit the spot. The location is clean, and in a good location.",

The service was excellent from the hostess to the waiter but that's where it ended. My husband's entree was $26ish for 3 golf ball sized meatballs. They lacked flavor, seasoning & were very dry. About how the frozen meatballs from publix taste before you put them in any sauces. I ordered the beef tenderloin and it was consistent with steak I've eaten at very low end establishments- not inedible, but not worth the price or quality of somewhere like Red Pony. It was cooked to the right temperature (medium rare) but it was so tough I struggled to cut through it with my steak knife, I wasted half of it because I got tired of chewing and it had no flavor...nor was there any steak sauce to soften the blow. The au gratin potatoes I had as a side were still very crunchy. The dessert menu looked good but we were too scared to attempt any after spending $85 on two entrees that we only ate half of. We paid our bill and ended up going somewhere else and eating because we were still hungry. It was really unfortunate because we frequently have date nights and love downtown Franklin but can't recommend this place after our experience.",

  "text": "We used Big Man's Moving Company on Monday and are SO INCREDIBLY GLAD we did! When you envision the way that your move should go, this is the company to hire to fulfill or exceed your expectations. \n\nIn the past four years, we have completed no less than 8 moves between our household and my grandmother's. Each time has been more stressful than the time before, with either damage to \"stuff\" or property, movers not showing up, or unfriendly/disinterested movers on phone calls or smoke breaks, to slow and careless packing/moving and the list goes on.. We were very nervous about who to hire for my grandmother's most recent move, but based on reviews and discussions, we chose to hire Big Man'e Moving Company. The moved us this week and it was the VERY BEST moving experience. Ever. For starters, they were on time with the amount of movers and supplies they promised. They worked so hard, diligently, and compassionately all day. It was sort of unbelievable, honestly.  Each of the movers treated our belongings as if they were there own when packing, padding, wrapping, and moving.  We've slowly been unpacking for almost a week and we haven't found one thing broken or damaged. They also appeared to genuinely care about where my grandmother wanted each piece of furniture placed and moved anything for her with a smile.  When a room or area would fill up with boxes to the point that it might impede her ability to get around, they would see the issue and anticipate the problem by asking if they could start placing in another area.  These guys had more than just strong bodies, they put thought and effort into what they were doing, anticipating our needs before we had to ask.  This is not what you get with \"other movers\" who will box and stack until there is no way to enter/exit, move around, or even fix the problem. It sounds corny, but they were a pleasure to work with and have in our home.  So much so that my grandmother invited them back whenever they are in the area.  I cannot stress enough about how hard they hussled, all with a smile and a gracious, positive attitude. This is something that sounds trivial, but having had experiences with other \"not so friendly\" movers, I can tell you that their positive attitude makes a BIG difference in this line of work. Lastly, they came in UNDER our anticipated budget. No kidding. We HIGHLY recommend this company.  Thank you to Josh, Charles, Mark and John for everything you did for us. We sure do appreciate you",

  "text": "This company is horrible! The equivalent of slum lords at this point. I closed in February of 2016 I didn't receive my HOA information until almost 2 months later. This trash and landscape upkeep have been nonexistent since I've been here. They refuse to address the trash dumping issue but continue to raise the HOA fee. I've filed complaints through their website and included pictures to no avail. We couldn't even safely walk our dog due to shattered beer bottles on the sidewalk that have been there all weekend.\n\nAs of today after my interaction with Kathy Sullivan or Sutherland(she didn't want to give me her name I had to ask 3x) I can't say anything has gotten better. She proceeded to tell me that even though my agreement and there website states they can have cars towed they no longer do that and I would just need to park elsewhere. Then basically said she had to be there and she wasn't going to do that. Then called me back and wanted to suddenly help. Keep in mind they just sent a tow truck with no hesitation a month before and I told her this. When I told her I wanted to speak with someone else she flat out said, \" no you won't they are all under me right now I'm the only one you can talk to.\" I've never dealt with such a rude \"manager\".",

  "text": "Barrio has an excellent selection of beers and good pub food. While I always enjoy the food, the service always seems to be lacking. This is likely due to the fact the restaurant is a seat yourself establishment. I find this rather odd for such a large place, but I don't care as long as the service is fine. We had trouble getting our server's attention, and they seemed to be all over the place. I don't know how it's organized, but it didn't seem like anyone had a section they were assigned to.\n\nIn terms of beer, Barrio has a nice variety of beers available, so everyone can find something they like. I prefer lighter beers, such as wheat ale, hefeweizen, etc., so I'm very picky about what I order. I'm not into stouts, porters, IPAs, and many smaller breweries often have very bitter selections. One of my friends suggested half Barrio Blonde, half cider. I was skeptical since the drink was flat as hell when the server brought it to me, but it was delicious. Their cider is incredibly sweet, so the Blonde mellows it out without diluting the flavor.\n\nI've always enjoyed the food here. I usually get the sonora dog as it's a good size for a hot dog meal, and their fries are delicious. We also ordered the chips and salsa. The salsa tasted fresh, but I don't think they make their own chips.\n\nOverall, good food and beer, but the service seems to be hit or miss.",

  "text": "HORRIBLE! We will never return. \n\nWe've been here before and enjoyed it so we thought it would be a safe choice when taking out three of my students after a fun, Christmas-y Saturday in the city. \n\nWe had a reservation for 7:30 but were walking towards the wrong location so I called to say we were running late. Arrived at 7:45 and didn't get seated until 8:00. It was packed and loud. As of 9:00, we still didn't have our food. \n\nThe only saving grace of this experience was the fact that our waitress was nice and the food runner was extremely kind and personable. \n\nOur waitress was, however, set up for failure. When she greeted us she let us know that they were out of about 6 things on the menu. Never a great start. As the night went on she had to keep bringing back food and drinks from every table in her station. It's hard to be a good waitress when the management, kitchen and bar are not doing their part. \n\nThe most disturbing part of this whole night was that the hallway leading up to the bathroom smelled like a dirty diaper. It was disgusting. I thought it was the bathroom but once we got into the bathrooms, they smelled like bleach. That made me feel better about the bathrooms but wayyyyyy worse about the restaurant. The smell was coming from the hall which is between the bar and the kitchen. If it isn't the bathrooms that smell, then what exactly is it? How disgusting. Even the 3 six year olds with me were making a huge deal and holding their noses and saying how disgusting it was. One of them said, \"if you are in a fancy restaurant, it's supposed to be clean, it shouldn't smell like this.\" EXACTLY. \n\nThe staff were all rude. I stopped to let the bartender go ahead of me since he was working. Even though I was a female with three young girls, he accepted my offer, barreled past us and didn't even look or say thank you. How rude!!!! The manager wasn't even kind until he had to do a table visit but when we were just walking past him, he also blew past without using manners. \n\nOur burgers both came out undercooked. I said I wanted mine burnt and it came out red. My man said he wanted his med well and his came out red as well. We had to send them back. When they came back out, they had no fries. They had to go back again. When they finally came out they just weren't good. All they tasted like was the grill. They had no other flavor. I didn't even want to waste the calories since by this point we waited over an hour for our food, it was past 9:00 and it wasn't even good...so I ate less than half. The fries weren't good so I didn't eat those either. The manager did not come back to see if they were better. He did not comp the uneaten burger which was clearly still not up to standard...or discount the bill at all. I'm not one to WANT that to be done but when you are offering a terrible experience with sub par food and a kitchen that literally smells like poo, I think you should try to do something. Offer the girls dessert on the house...something! \n\nOne of my students said she wanted only grapes with her children's menu selection. When their kids meals came out she was the only one that had zero grapes. She got a totally different fruit salad from the other two girls. They had grapes and strawberries and she had no grapes at all even though she said she wanted grapes. It made no sense. We had to ask for the other fruit salad to be brought out since she didn't like the fruit options in hers. The manager said they scrambled to make the one she had. Why are you scrambling to make something she doesn't even want when the two girls next to her have something totally different...which happens to be what she wants?! The menu made no mention of there being separate fruit salad options. Even if it did, she was clear she wanted grapes so she still got the wrong one! \n\nWe asked for refills on the girls water multiple times before it happened. There was an old, melted, stepped on butter packet under our table. We personally did not have butter. \n\nLike I said at the start, it was a horrible, horrible experience and I don't wish to ever return here. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone looking to dine out in the city. There are too many other places that offer better food, better service and a dining room that doesn't smell like feces. We've been here on New Year's Day before when it was crowded and it was still a good experience so the fact that it was a busy Saturday is not an excuse. The whole goal of a restaurant is to be busy and just because you're busy doesn't mean your service and food should start going downhill. If that was the case, you wouldn't be busy anymore. \n\nHorrible!!! Never again!",

J'aime French Bakery has a great ambiance and the happy ghosts of the long gone Millenium Coffee (and Afterwords) that used to occupy the space.\nBright and cheerful, simple yet elegant - the visual appeal and feel is great.  I arrived early and my server was nice and cheerful, very helpful.  He seemed a bit chagrined when I purchased most of the stock that was set out - 3 each of: eclairs, pear tarts, orange tarts, blueberry tarts, 6 chocolate croissants, 4 sugar brioches, 3 chocolate brioches and two regular French baguettes.  It was too early for a few of the other items on the menu like the chocolate tartlet or the Paris Philadelphia.\nService was good and the pastries were overall pretty good and the baguettes were excellent.  One of our guests oversees the baking of croissants in France so he felt the chocolate croissant were a bit sloppy and as a baker of croissant and eclairs myself, I have to say I agreed.  They looked a bit hastily made but they tasted fine.  I still think that J'aime French Bakery was pretty good overall in spite of a few issues and so I still give them a 4.",

  "text": "Went here before a concert at Bankers Life. There wasn't many people in there. 2 bartenders working. They seemed to be very attentive to them (it's self serve beer and it seems like most take that route) - we had wine. Not only did we have to walk up to asked for another glass (we were seated at a time DIRECTLY in front of the bar area - near their register - so not like we were hidden), but even asked for a glass. They poured it, then forgot to give it to us. About 10 mins later (seemed like longer) we had to question each other if we ever got that glass. We hadn't. Had to go back up to bar. And ask for it. They had it sitting behind the bar....really?!?! We then got a hot sandwich with sweet potato fries. Both came out warm. We ordered a sauce for our fries based off the menu, and was told after we placed order that the menu changed and they didn't have that anymore - fine but shldnt you know that when taking my order. I asked for a different sauce - curry ketchup. I got.......ketchup. Way to listen to me. Was completely frustrating. Not a great experience and actually sorry I even had to pay for what we got. Red wine blend was mediocre (only have 2 wines total). Food wasn't appetizing. Service horrible. Just not a happy experience, which is unfortunate bc I so wanted it to be....place had great reviews and a cool feel inside...but it crashed and burned.",

After looking over the menu, I decided to try the BBBLT.  While I was not exactly sure what the first two B's were for, I assumed after reading the description, that it just meant more bacon.  I was pretty excited.  When I received the sandwich, while good, I was a little disappointed in the amount of bacon.  Don't get me wrong, it was a great BLT but when the description says \"Tons of hickory smoked bacon\", I expected a little more than what I got.  The sodas they had were from Excel Soda - always good!  I would like to go back and try some more of the menu.",

We started of with their pork & shrimp dumplings. They looked more like Shu mai which was different than what we expected but very delicious. They have 4 spice levels; mild, medium, hot, & Thai hot. They are not kidding around with how spicy their food is. Normally I order the Pad Thai the first time I visit a Thai restaurant but decided to try the spicier Garlic Beef at their medium spice level. It was delicious & perfectly spicy. The hubby got the Panang curry chicken, medium spice, & it was delicious & perfectly spiced too. The portion sizes were just right. We finished off our meal with their sweet, sticky rice with mango. OMG, it was the best I've ever had! They use the black rice & it was warm & drizzled with hot sweetened, condensed milk. The mango was perfectly ripe & there was more than 2-3 slices. We will definitely go back. The hubby wants to try something hot.\nAttention Vegans - they have a separate menu of dishes just for you!",

  "text": "I have a lot of pros and only one con about SoulCycle. \n\nLet's get the con quickly out of the way: it's wicked expensive. $30 per class ($20 introductory).  It is what it is, but people are clearly glad to pay it. Maybe it's because of all of the pros listed below...\n\nNeedless to say, the workout is great. You get what you put into it. But as long as you're not just sitting there, you should be sweating profusely shortly into the workout and throughout. The room where you cycle is kept at a comfortable temperature and it has cool lighting and a great sound system. Next, the staff: extremely well trained, super nice, very upbeat people who are glad to help. Every single one of them, including the manager, Natalie. They greet you with a smile and make sure you get acclimated comfortably and quickly. Another pro: very, very clean facility with well maintained showers, locker room area, and bathrooms.  They provide clean, soft towels and filtered water fountains. And lastly, the instructors. I have seen two instructors since I've been coming here and they are both energetic and positive people who get you pumped and motivated to have a good workout. \n\nI am very pleased with my experience at SoulCycle and I would strongly recommend it to anyone!",

  "text": "My wife and I decided to check out Mad Rex before a show at the Fillmore last week and it was decent in some ways and lackluster in others. Our waiter approached our table and asked if it was our first time dining with them, which we told him it was. He seemed excited that we were first timers and he explained to us that all of the decorations were art and authentic etc. He then pointed to the survivors menu and explained that anything were ordered from it would come on a hot salt rock that we would use to cook our own meat. We ordered two drinks which were good from the happy hour menu. My wife and I were both enticed by the survivors\nMenu and ordered a Mac n cheese as an appetizer and a survivor menu burger each. The mac and cheese arrived at the exact same time as our burgers, which also came with a side of Mac n cheese making the whole appetizer kind of pointless. Regardless, we ate it and felt it was overly covered in cheez whiz and not enough of the other cheese that were supposed to be on it. We moved onto the burgers that were sizzling on the salt rock with all the topics surrounding it, except the cheese and onions which were already on the burger. No plates to put the burger on once it was done which made eating slightly annoying. The cheese being already on the burger made flipping them impossible, unless we wanted to have all of our cheese stuck to the salt rock. We let our burgers sizzle for a few mins until the bottoms were burnt and took them off hoping they would be medium in the center. They were not. They were in fact burnt on the bottom and raw on the top where the cheese was. I bit into my burger only to find a cold bloody center. I put the burger back onto the salt rock hoping it would cook more but by then the salt rock was not hot enough. We picked the burger apart and ate the parts that were actually cooked. Nobody came to check on us while we were eating but once we had finished and our plates had been cleared, a really nice manager approached said she noticed we ate off the survivor menu and asked how it was. At this point my wife and I were just over the entire experience and didn't bother making a big stink. We ate enough to be full but it was just a very lackluster meal. The last round of drinks that we ordered was taking a very long time so they came out and were in a much bigger glass to make up for the weight which was nice but we still didn't receive them until we were already paying the check. Won't be going back unfortunately due to these issues.",

The green beans that came with the redfish were not really edible, but the redfish made up for it. I ordered a Moscow Mule. They didn't skimp one bit on the liquor. The ONLY reason I gave four stars instead of five, was because our service was lacking. I got a cup of bisque instead of the bowl I ordered, and the server wasn't very attentive. These are both things I can overlook when a restaurant is really busy. However, we came at a time that was what I would call more steady than busy, meaning we had absolutely no wait for our table. Maybe our server was having an off day, which is understandable. We will definitely eat here again!",

  "text": "My fiance and I decided to try this place out for dinner last night, and what an amazing experience we had! Our server was sweet, attentative, and immediately brought us water after we sat down. It wasn't very busy, which surprised me. We decided to get a couple starters, the traditional spring rolls and pork belly pops. I am a huge spring roll fan, and these ones were tasty and unique with roasted pork belly, basil, and prawns. The accompanying peanut sauce was great; I could've eaten another bowl of it. The pork belly pops were tender, rich, and flavorful. I let my fiance have the last one, and he was happy haha. \n\nFor our main courses, I got the tonkatsu ramen and he got the shoyu ramen. The broth was delicious, creamy and flavorful. My fiance added some sauce to his, thinking it needed a little something more, but I was happy with mine. It was full of meat, which was a nice change, since a lot of places usually skimp on the meat, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. This place is now my favorite in Reno for ramen, and a much shorter drive than our favorite ramen joint in San Francisco. \n\nThere is a full bar, so my fiance enjoyed a couple drinks, and I had a tasty Vietnamese coffee. Although we came for ramen, we will definitely be coming back to try some of the other menu items as well. If you haven't been here, give it a try!",

At first I thought I was allergic to the grass, because I am allergic to grass, but after hosing off the second time, feeling a horrible burning and stinging sensation, I realized that I was covered with fire ants   ! They were extremely aggressive! They were blasted up my pants with all the mud and dirt too and I suffered hundreds of bites! The staff acted like this never happened before, but I read about it online, which means that they ignore the problem! Avoid This Place! Because you never want to be covered with fire ants  particularly when they are sprayed all over you! It was positively horrible and I'm also allergic to bug bites on top of it! The staff gave me back my money, but it really didn't make me feel any better. I'll see how it goes tonight and maybe have to go to the hospital later! I can't believe this happened to me!",

It might have been the least interesting and creative flow I've taken in years. The instructor had zero energy, monotone voice and a \"why did I agree to sub on a Sunday\" attitude.

My son enjoyed his hamburger while I started with the Mac & Cheese Fritters, which came with a slightly spicy dipping sauce. This was a big appetizer, at least for one person! My entree was the BBQ chicken with a side of mac and cheese and broccoli. It was decent but nothing special. My son also had the tiramisu milkshake and for dessert had the chocolate peanut butter pie, which was pretty sweet! Service was generally good.

  "text": "It is obvious after digging into this yelp page that the only reason people continue to patronize this restaurant is because it is paying yelp for premium services which include HIDING THE PLETHORA OF TERRIBLE REVIEWS (over 30) in the \"not recommended\" section... dozens and dozens of credible yelpers giving honest opinions being pushed to the back pages so a business that should be closed can continue to operate and steal money from unsuspecting tourists (not that I'm a fan of tourists) and locals trying unsuccessfully to continue to give this place a chance. Just a word to  the wise... if you have 30 something reviews that aren't recommended, it's not the reviews that constitute the problem , IT'S THE ESTABLISHMENT. This is why i really don't even trust yelp anymore at all. \n\nI have ordered here approximately 5-10 times in the last couple years, mostly from Uber eats but in person as well. It has never been good and i don't know why i have yet to learn my lesson. After today, however, I'm actually done and i feel the need to warn others because this place should be nowhere near as popular as it is. It's diner food that tastes like diner food but there is literally ALWAYS something wrong with the order, something improperly cooked, or something missing from the order. This time the wrongness came in the form of a COMPLETELY RAW HAMBURGER that cost $11.50.\n\nPotential customers please see the photo, but Slim if y'all are allowing that garbage to come out of your kitchen you obviously have no quality control whatsoever, let alone a meat thermometer, and certainly don't deserve 3.5 stars or honestly even to be open. I will not be patronizing this establishment ever again and i hope you, my fellow yelpers, won't either.",

Bala's location typically gets my order incorrect while King of Prussia picks and chooses when they want to charge for two sides of dressing.

  "text": "I lived in Philly years ago, but this was my very favorite place to eat and shop.  My favorite was fresh meals that they served daily that much later found out was macrobiotic .  It was amazing and delicious!!  I always felt good after I ate there.  At the time thought it was just health food, but then years later found a cookbook on Amazon written by the store owners, and I was like....oooohhhhh, so that was the macrobiotic diet. \n  Every friend that came through town, I brought them here to eat.   They loved the food too. \n\n I now live in Portland Or. and, yeah there is great food here, miss this place.  Portland mostly has Gluten-free, organic vegetarian...but not macrobiotic.  (Personally they blame gluten for too much out here!) \n\nOwners: Come open a store/ restaurant out here!...since I will never be back in Philly again.  Portland is awesome!!!",

It turned out to be quite serendipitous, as they actually had a GMT Master II Batman in stock.\n\nGregory took immaculate care of the sale. I have large wrists and it was a bit too tight, but it was OK because he tracked down an extra link. He also took me on a little tour of their offices (cool IT stuff guys) and threw me some nice swag. Instead of carrying it around with me they mailed it (for free) next fay air to my local shipping center. \n\nAnd I will not mention what I paid for the piece, but it was extremely reasonable. \n\nOverall I cannot recommend these guys enough. I would absolutely train down from NYC again to work with them.",

  "text": "I was really hesitant to get a second ear lobe piercing after I got it done with my mom when I was like 8 years old on an island at a jewelry store. It was traumatic as I waited to be the last one to have them shoot a stud with one of those retractable guns. They shouldn't even allow those things. It took over a year to heal and it hurt so bad that I walked out in tears. They had to cut the post off after it healed as they didn't inform me how to properly clean it. \n\nFast forward, 20 years later, I mustered myself into finally getting a 2nd lobe. This time at a reputable tattoo and piercing parlor. I just walk in without an appointment to Metamorphosis. This was the best ear piercing experience by far. They had a beautiful selection of titanium jeweled or metal studs, but I opted for beaded ones. Guess what? They're reusable for future piercings which is awesome. My 2nd lobe was done by Kristin-down to earth gal and experienced piercer. I highly recommend her. \n\nI would totally go back and get additional piercings in the future. The price for piercing is competitive to elsewhere, but I like how they take you into a private, sterile room like a doctor's office not like at a mall kiosk with everyone watching you. The piercing process was quick and painless, much less than having a 14 gauge needle stuck into your arm. They give you a care card and two plastic condiment cups with a bag of salt to cup over your ears to keep them clean while they're healing.",

Even though we did not have serious medical conditions, I experienced a panic attack. I heard a township representative and local firefighters claim that the hotel did not follow proper protocol because they did not contact 911 immediately. I was assured that I would hear from management the very next day. I have not, even though I've called and left voicemail. No response from them. We had to file incident reports with the hotel, firefighters, and the township. Today I woke up to find I was charged extra money for incidentals. You've got to be kidding me. I demand full reimbursement. This hotel has acted irresponsibly and unprofessionally. This hotel is so close to my parents house and I  was hoping to make it a tradition to stay here Christmas Eve. I will never stay at this hotel or recommend it again. @courtyardmarriottusa",

Why don't businesses require people coming in with animals to prove that they are a therapy dog, cat iguana, etc.?! It's very startling to turn the corner with your small child and realize there's a dog at their level. Most children are bitten in the face because they are at the same level as these canines. Instead of Home Depot worrying about their bottom dollar they need to be more concerned with lawsuits which would definitely affect their bottom line. If they allow these animals to be in their store and they attack and bite someone they WILL be held libel as well as the pet owner. How ridiculous that this seems to be the norm nowadays. If you can't leave your house without your iguana, dog, cat, bird then maybe you should stay home and not subject other people. Did you ever stop to think that maybe people are allergic to fur and pet dander? Be responsible.",

You will not find most of these dishes at other non-Turkish restaurants, not even at other Mediterranean restaurants.  Of course there are some dishes found elsewhere, but most are local to or customized as Turkish.  But they were all of high quality.  Only thing was that many of the entrees needed a side to round them out, and the menu doesn't really indicate that or offer a ton of sides.\n\nService was quite polite, but we didn't see our server for very long stretches.

Be sure to order pepper jack cheese sticks with sriracha dipping sauce for a nice departure from the old mozzarella sticks.\nWe plan to return for dinner soon.

  "text": "We recently had a new addition to our family - a Beautiful female Cane Corso. We decided to have her ears cropped as most Cane Corso owners do, and searched around to find a good vet who does this procedure. We discovered that there are very few vets who perform this procedure. However, after numerous phone calls, we finally found Dr. Singh at the All Pet Care Center who has excellent recommendations and utilizes lazer surgery. So we decided to have Dr. Singh perform the ear cropping procedure on our Mia and we are totally 100% satisfied with our experience at the All Pet Care Hospital and all of the staff there. Mia's ears look perfect. I highly recommend this vet and his staff located on Sunset Point Road in Clearwater for any veterinarian needs you may have.",

I was impressed with how well the staff worked the line in getting people seated and our server was on it, especially considering her workload which was several tables. The food came out pretty quickly as well. My problem was really with the food itself. I guess I was expecting too much, but the pancakes weren't anything special and the rest of the food: sausage, eggs and bacon weren't prepared very well. Sausage over cooked, bacon undercooked, and eggs were oddly very small. Plus out food came out cold which is an instant killer for me. We were just passing through on this trip but next time I'm in Nashville I won't be returning - there's just too many other options.",

Overall we felt extremely unwelcome from the moment we walked in the door.

  "text": "When my husband and I got engaged, we decided that we wanted to find the ring together. We talked about it a lot and we both agreed that we wanted the ring be 'one of a kind'...and for us, this meant having the ring designed and made by a local jeweler. We went to 7 ring shops before we walked into Portche's. The first thing I want to say about Portche's is that the staff is incredible! From the moment we walked through their doors until the day my husband picked up our rings, and every visit since then, has been so wonderful. Everyone we have encountered has been so helpful and kind...not to mention how professional and talented they are. I should mention that even though we opted to have our rings made special, I was slightly tempted to buy a ring that they already had in store. Some of their jewelry is vintage and most of the jewelry at Portche's has a kind of elegant quality. So, if you're looking to have something made special or just want to ogle beautiful jewelry, I would recommend a trip to Portche's.",

  "text": "Given that it was Christmas day, I'm not surprised there was quite a long wait for a table (1.5-2 hrs was the estimated time). Luckily we called ahead of time when we got to the hotel (online reservations can also be made but the front desk lady did mention something about being completely booked for the next 2 weeks..) so had our name put down 45 minutes before we actually headed down to the resturaunt. We still had to wait another 30 minutes but it was much better than waiting for over 1.5 hours like some other people.\n\nOnto the food, we got the AYCE sushi (dinner price $32.99) as their normal entree items (not sushi) already cost around $26+ and definitely got our money's worth. There's a large selection of rolls and although you can't get sashimi, they give you a good fish to rice ratio for their nigiri and their rolls weren't stuffed with thick layers of rice. Our favorite rolls were the San Francisco and Hokkaido. I'm also a big fan of salmon sashimi but their seared nigiris are also really good! The fish tasted fresh and pleased us all. You put in your order on a sheet of paper and it comes out in batches which is nice so you don't  have to wait forever for everything to come out all at once. However, it did take a while for everything to come and in the end, we cancelled 3 of our orders because we were stuffed (so perhaps it was a good thing it took a while for it to come out?). Granted the place was packed so that may have affected the speed of the sushi making. Our waiter was extremely friendly even though we could tell she was really busy and overall I would recommend this resturaunt.\n\nP.S. don't forget to check in for a free cocktail or draft beer. Only one check in is allowed per table though",

  "text": "From the moment I walked into Cake Bake, it felt like I was living a dream. I was lucky enough to visit during the holidays and I'm so glad I did! Every inch of the place was covered in absolutely beautiful holiday décor. Christmas trees and garlands everywhere, twinkling lights and the most amazing smells. My team at work had lunch reservations and we were seated in this decadent room with a fireplace and a giant farm sized table to gather around. \n\nThe food was remarkable! Every bite I took had me in awe. I started with a lavender latte, which I tend to order whenever it's on the menu. I have to say that this was one of the best I've ever had.  It was so smooth and flavorful, there was even crystalized lavender sprinkled on top. How fab is that?! Next up was my actual lunch. I ordered the soup of the day (sweet potato) and a ceaser salad on the side along with a baguette. The soup was thick and creamy. It came with a dollop of orange crème on top and I ate every single bite. Dipping the baguette in the soup made for heaven in your mouth - seriously. The baguette wasn't tough to get through like most baguettes I've tried. It was crunchy (but not too much) on the outside and nice and warm and chewy on the inside. I also got a slice of carrot cake for the road. After a three-hour drive back to Columbus, I couldn't wait to dig in to it. First of all, it was enormous! I only ate half and saved the rest for later. The cream cheese frosting was thick and sweet, the carrot cake itself was so incredibly moist and flavorful. It was a fantastic choice! Another adorable little touch, glitter was on every single thing I ate. I'm not kidding, everything from my latte to my soup to my salad. Now, I'm not typically a glitter girl but this made everything so fun and unique. I totally embraced the glitter during my stay. \n\nLastly, the service was top notch from the moment I walked in the door. The hostess greeted me warmly and our server was the sweetest and so on top of everything. Another cool aspect of this place was the window into the kitchen. You could see all the chefs in their neat chef hats, hard at work. It's easy to see why Cake Bake has been so successful and Indy is so lucky to be getting a second location soon!",

When someone finally spoke to us, that person claimed that the employees assigned to our job had \"disappeared\" and would not be coming back. Not only that, we were told that part of the office staff had disappeared at the same time. That was all we ever learned. We were then double-charged with the tasks already completed. We gave up trying to negotiate anything that made sense over the telephone and drove to their office. Another mistake !! If you enter their office you'll come into contact with with Jhonny himself: also rude & brusque & aggressive... always denying anything that's wrong could possible be his fault. \n   \nWe continued to complain to Jhonny that partial work done at our place seemed done too hastily and-- remember-- NEVER COMPLETED!!!... & of course, that he was over-charging in every category.  When we pressed our complaints, Jhonny demanded that we sign an statement agreeing not to post a BAD review. I refused.

The job they did was nothing short of perfection.  Their attention to detail was superb, always immediately cleaned up after working and our home looks stunning.  Another major benefit is that Patrick always showed up on time; answered calls, texts and emails promptly; and completed the project on schedule.  Anyone in the Tahoe area knows how rare this is. We will hire him hands down for any future painting needs.",

Expertly fried, not greasy with the right amount of flavor, these tenders are awesome! Definitely shareable (or not)!\n\nAnd the Bru fries, oh the fries are wonderful! My personal favorite dipping sauce is the black pepper mayo. \n\nBoth are excellent as a to go order or for staying in the restaurant. And, as I've written before, don't be afraid to sit at the bar if you're able to! A great way to cut the wait for a table and chat with knowledgeable bartenders!",

We're up and down Keystone quite often, but for some reason...we seem to not think of it.\n\nSahm's family of restaurants has always impressed me.  They're combination of solid food and service, the fact they're locally owned, and a nice, varied menu makes me a fan.\n\nThis restaurant appears, on the inside, a bit more upscale to me than some of their others.  It doesn't have the sports bar feel that the one in Fishers has, it's more of a place to go have a quiet meal and conversation.\n\nAlthough it appears a bit more upscale, the menu isn't expensive, rather, I'd call it moderate.  Nice mixture of salads, burgers, steaks, fish, and more.  I'm pretty certain anyone can find something to suit their palate here.\n\nThe knotted buns on the burgers are AMAZING.  Huge fan.\n\nThe one thing that kept me from giving a 5 star review was the service.  I found it to be a bit aloof and not especially prompt.  It wasn't terrible, mind you, but enough to knock a star off.",

  "text": "I came here to watch Essence on Saturday night. I got there as the doors were opening so I got promptly seated. This is the first time I have ever been to Sammy's showroom and I was surprised how small the stage was. I have been to the Eldorado showroom and I was expecting the showroom to be similar of that size, but nevertheless, it didn't take away from the great show that these beautiful ladies put on. \n\nI decided to limit my alcohol that night, so I didn't order any other drinks, but I did appreciate the complimentary glass of champagne upon being seated.\n\nWe got seated up front and in retrospect, I regret sitting so close to the stairs. Being so close to the stage, you become victim to awkward eye contact and having to keep turning around to see what was happening when the performers went off stage into the crowd. \n\nI loved the show although and thought it was a great burlesque style show and the lead singer slayed those songs! She has an amazing voice! The dancers were very entertaining and comedic as well. They got that bend and snap and hair flipping down to an art!\n\nI had a great time and great thanks to Yelp for making this experience possible for me.\n\nI would definitely recommend this show to anyone wanting to watch a good show.",

When it's busy (weekends, holiday time, weekends at holiday time) there's going to be a big line, and the people who stay in it are the ones who are going to get their things wrapped before the people who leave it behind for later pick-up. At least, that's what I'd expect if I continue to wait. If you ask, they'll probably just give you paper to wrap it yourself (though, Lord knows it will look like crap if I do it!), or you can go down the street to Papyrus (beautiful wrapping job, but they charge).",

My car wasn't very dirty to begin with and the interior was slightly dusty as it was washed a few weeks ago. After I left, I went to the grocery store and when I got out of my car, I looked on the passenger side and was surprised and disappointed at how streaked it was on both doors. Front bumper was sad looking also. I have to say I couldn't believe I had just gotten a car wash, except the interior looked nice (one of the stars). I attempted to call when I got back into the car to explain that I would like to come back another day, but got the answering machine. I'll try and call tomorrow, but only as a courtesy call because I doubt that I even want to go back. The employees were very nice -- thus the other star.

The amount of food was so much for me that I had it packed up and had dinner later on!\n\nFor my appetizer I selected the tandoori chicken naan pizza. To be honest, it wasn't exactly what I was expecting - if I hadn't known that the pizza was made with naan, I wouldn't have had any clue. It seemed just like a regular personal sized pizza. It was tasty, with a little bit of Indian seasonings and delicious peppers, in addition to the chicken and cheese.\n\nFor my entree, I got the chicken makhani. To be honest, I really didn't have much of a clue what I was ordering, I just know that I like chicken, and figured I'd give it a shot. The menu I had didn't mention that it was a \"butter chicken\" dish, which might have given me a better idea. Nonetheless, I thought that the chicken was delicious and flavorful, and just the right tenderness with the meat. The rice was a bit on the bland side, but the sauce on the chicken made up for it. \n\nAll in all, the food here was pretty good - my husband ordered the chicken madras, which I sampled and we both agreed that the makhani was far better. So if you're visiting, I'd definitely recommend that dish. Can't wait to come back and try a bit more of the menu!",

  "text": "I had fabulous service for my daughter and me at by Nikkie at Divinity Salon. We were in dire need of a salon that was well versed in ethnic hair. I'm black mixed and my kids are black, plus we have tons of hair. We're from CT and use to such variety of hairdressers that can do any type of hair. We've tried many salons in the Tucson area that promised they are well trained in \"ethnic\" hair and are excellent with black hair. I didnt realize they feel they could do ethnic hair because they have a large amount of Mexican clientele. The results from those salons being only that my bank account was lighter and I had to try and fix something as simple as a blow out on my own at home. \nSomeone suggested Ms.Nikkie at Divinity and sent me a link to her work. Needless to say, the very next day I  called and made an appointment for my daughter AND me. Nikkie was able to take both of us on that afternoon. We might have missed the salon had we not seen the inconspicuous sign in the front that we were informed was just put up not too long ago. FYI, the salon is all the way around the back of the building. \nUpon our arrival, we were promptly greeted by our stylist who offered us a seat as she was just finishing her client. That was fine, we looked around, used the bathroom and had some water. I found the salon was clean with a nice decor. The music they played was something everyone would enjoy and was not so loud you could barely concentrate nor was it so soft one would struggle to hear. \nThere's plenty services offered in this one salon, which is great if you don't want to travel all around Tucson. They offer mani/pedis and eyebrows. They do weaves, wigs, braids, twists, basically any and everything to do with enhancing your beauty. They offer clients the option to book appointments entirely online, but I prefer making appointments with a human being to be sure there are no misunderstandings.\nAll in all I found our stylist, Nikkie, to be pleasant and very talented. It was a major plus that my daughter liked her. Our hair looked flawless upon departure and we received tons of compliments! We've been back and I'm making another appointment asap. \nI did leave one star off ( I wish I could only leave 1/4 of a star off instead) because you will most likely be there for hours and that may deter some folks pressed for time. I've always alleviated this issue with any salon by automatically assuming I'll be there quite some time. I only book days I have nothing to do, but that's just me.",

Niki is so sweet too, she suggested to me that to put some glitter to it (good idea). I love coming here! The atmosphere is friendly, and they even have complimentary drinks.",

  "text": "After years of passing by this unassuming business in my neighborhood, I finally tried it and can't believe I've been missing out! \n\nI was easily able to make a reservation for my group of 6 on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was not crowded at all on this particular night and they made sure to set a table for six prior to our arrival. The place itself is rather small, with a long bar running down one side and a row of tables along the opposite wall. There was a pretty narrow path between the two. This did make it a bit squishy for those of us with our backs to the people at the bar and awkward for others to walk in between. \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful with the eclectic menu. We opted to eat family style, with food delivered as it was prepared. We started with the korean fried chicken, one spicy and one soy garlic. These are essentially amazing chicken wings. I say go for the spicy - it was super flavorful and not all that spicy. My personal favorite were the short rib ho-ppang. The buns were fresh and delicious and the pork was seasoned absolutely perfectly. We then had the beef dolsot bibimbap - ours was not served sizzling as described, but was very tasty all the same. Finally, we had the japchae which was probably my second favorite. \n\nOverall, this was a great group experience. We loved the food and option to eat family style. I'll definitely return for more of those pork buns and other deliciousness in the future!",

We both ordered a steak and had it delivered to our table in good time.  That's where things went south.  I cut into the edge of the steak and found it to be tough and overlooked. I then tried to cut into the centre and it took all my strength to cut through it.  My wife really could not cut through hers.  We called  a waiter over and he said he would let our server know. Five minutes later we still had our inedible food in front of us with no sign of our server or any indication that our concerns were going to be addressed. We had no choice but to walk out.",

  "text": "Terrible service and parts department!  OK, bad service one time, I give it as a fluke and pass it off.  Two times, and well they made good after a complaint to the service manager, so I hoped it too was a fluke.  But THREE times!!! That did it.  I drive a distance to service my car at Glanzmann because I bought it from them, and wanted to be loyal.  This last service call was a warranty repair.  So I have to wait 3 weeks after they order the part (and I'm told the part is in), to make sure I get a loaner car--waaayyy too long.  Ok though, I do, and book an appointment.  When I take the car in it should be ready the next day.  No one calls me with an update on the progress of the car, so I call them at the end of the 2nd day and they tell me it will be ready in a few hours.  Because I can't make it there before they close, I drive down the next morning to pick up the car.  Upon arrival they tell me they ordered the wrong part and I have to wait 6 more days till it gets here.  What a waste of time----I still have the loaner but would prefer my own car.  It would have been helpful it anyone would have called me BEFORE I drove down to get the car, which I was already told was completely repaired!!!  This is just the third mishap, the other two were not as drastic, but still a great inconvenience.  So you have to wonder if there is a serious gap in service and parts department management and communication.  Don't bring your car here, one hand doesn't know what the other is doing.",

(The cooked radishes were a miss - too bitter even for we radish lovers!) We also had a huge grilled mushroom and a to-die-for plate of fried chicken thighs. \n\nOne important issue: the back of the meal was very rushed. Looking back on it, that was partly our fault - we ordered everything at once. But I wish our server would have coached us about the pace of the food. We hadn't even received our initial glasses of wine when the first three items arrived at the table. And the bussers were incredibly eager to clear our table so they could bring the next two plates. Next time we go we will be more assertive about the pace we are seeking, and we will probably order the mezze first, take a pause, and then order our mains so we can be in better control of the timing. \n\nOtherwise, a very lovely meal.",

My wife and I were just in the middle of the main course of our dinner, up until that point a pleasant meal with good service, when we were asked to move tables, since you had a reservation that needed the table apparently and they had \"shown up early\".  We literally picked up our own plates and had to move with no apology at all from your staff.  Only after we moved, when I asked our new waitress , a very nice person, whom the manager was I was informed by her it was the man whom had been taking care of our table but had since disappeared after we were forced to move and had made no attempt to remedy this situation. When he finally came over after I specifically asked, I asked if this was representative of the treatment your restaurant provides their customers, embarrassingly asking them to move tables with other patrons staring and wondering what is happening.  I was provided neither a satisfactory answer nor any apology or attempt to remedy this.  I left my half eaten meal on the table as I was disgusted at this point.  So again I ask you is this the way your company treats customers?  Being busy and having reservations is not an excuse for unacceptable practice.  I hope all that view your site for restaurant recommendations read the above and your response or if none lack of before patronizing",

There were several different kinds of chicken all very good, vegetables, plain rice, chicken biryani, soup, appetizers, salad, chutneys, desserts, mango juice, and masala tea all for $10.99. Can't beat that price anywhere! Before you sit down you are asked what kind of naan you would like to have and then it is brought to you in a basket. Water is constantly replenished. The food is piping hot at the buffet. Service is quite attentive. It is a small place, but homey and quiet. A friend who is a chef highly recommended this place.

  "text": "We haven't been in St Pete very long and are constantly on the lookout for cute places with fresh seafood. (Why else live at the beach?)\n\nSeveral people have mentioned Shells so we headed over to check it out.\n\nCute place, small parking lot behind with street parking all around. I'm guessing during season lots of people are within walking distance.\n\nWe were welcomed even before we got to the door as one of the ream was helping a disabled woman out the front door. (HUGE BONUS POINTS). Hosts welcomed us again and seated us quickly.\n\nWe were seated in the bar area to the right... initially the bartender was a little (OK, A lot) loud; but I think our server said something. Seems there was a large group in the main dining room which is why we and several other tables we seated in the bar.\n\nOur server was awesome, welcomed us, got soft drinks, told us about happy hour drinks and as it turns out our Yelp checkin got me a margarita!\n\nThe walls have chalkboard paint with cute quotes and specials - we ordered the Fried Calamari ($7.99) while we checked out the menu.\n\nThe basket of Fried Calamari was good sized, crispy and flavorful; just enough for two of us to share... the \"spicy Diablo sauce\" didn't have much of a kick.\n\nMy husband went with the Jambalaya ($12.99) a big bowl of blackened chicken, shrimp and Andouille sausage with peppers, onions, rice in a creole sauce... the position was a great size, plenty of chicken, shrimp and sausage... not as spicy as he would have liked (we do like spicy)... but our server quickly brought him hot sauce.\n\nI went for the Seafood Cioppino over linguini ( their special that night and out servers recommendation). It was a big bowl with a good sized portion of pasta, a TON of seafood for the price (I think it was $15.99) clams, mussels, fish, bay scallops and shrimp with chunks of tomato is a garlicky broth. I was really impressed with the amount of seafood and the flavor. It also came with two nice chunks of garlic bread.... which as great to sop up the last of the amazing broth!\n\nWe didn't have any room for dessert... but will next time!\n\nHappy hour specials, wonderful service, fresh seafood and really reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food. \n\nWE will absolutely be back; there's LOTS on the menu we want to try.",

We got the desserts on the house, which they really did not have to do but we really appreciated it. They also gave up a complimentary appetizer. The Dan dan noodles are fabulous and spicy (careful if you don't like spicy food). We also got the Mee goreng which was delicious. The Harissa grilled tofu tacos were so tasty as well. We got the Rose Lemonade and Imli Soda which were great, a bit on the sweeter side though. The soft serve of the day was really good.

I have to agree, at least banana puddingwise, yes comparable. Magnolia's makes ice box cake, which we didn't see at Sweet Life, and I LOVE ice box cake... but I am also a Phulph'n, and Magnolia's ain't worth 2 hours on the Chinatown bus for pudding, when I can get some BETTER options here on South Street.\n\nUnlike Magnolia's, Sweet Life has a variety of pudding flavors: peaches-n-cream, banana, banana caramel, salted caramel, no-nana, \"magic\" (like a Snickers bar), etc. And Sweet Life adds cake at the bottom, which I do not remember being in Magnolia's cups (just wafers). Bakery cake, all saturated with the pudding to make it thicker, was a really nice twist to America's idea of Jello snack cups.\n\nAlso got the potato pie, which was sweet, and spicey, and savory too. Very good!\n\nCan't wait to try more next time!",

Very knowledgeable and friendly. The food was amazing, I got the Ruben and fries my fiancé got the burger and salad. The Ruben was so hot I couldn't even eat it for a few torturous minutes. The fries were delicious and crispy, the corned beef was so freaking fresh it was ridiculous! My fiancé's burger was amazing and fresh as well! The beers were super good too! \nAll I can say is that management needs to handle things better because if Chase hadn't stepped in and made sure we were seated we would never have had an amazing experience here and discovered this gem.

I'm eating the blueberry lemon scone now and I love how it's not too overly sweet and you can really taste the blueberry in it. Owner also personally came out to greet and talk to us while we were there which we appreciated. Could feel some Sunday morning vibes.

  "text": "It was almost midnight on a Tuesday and we had just returned home from a full 13 hour day of traveling; we were hungry and tired. Instead of opting to go to a sit down place we decided to drive thru Steak n Shake. It had been forever since we had been to one so looking at the menu was something we had to do. I was hoping to get a chicken melt, but I didn't see that on the menu. Instead, they had a grilled chicken sandwich and that seemed to be the only chicken sandwich I saw, so I ordered it. My husband just wanted to order a burger with fries. There was a car in front of us so we didn't think much of it. We placed our order and were told to pull around to the window to pay. The car in front of us was still waiting so that's exactly what we did too. It took about 10 minutes for the car in front of us to get their meal and then we pulled up to pay. Once we paid we waited for about 6-7 minutes before our food was ready. I guess it's a good thing they cook our food to order, but that was a long time to wait IMO. We were handed our bag (we double checked it for accuracy) with drinks and were on our way.",

  "text": "We live on Cape Cod, and obviously know very well what good New England seafood is.  A local tipster told us of this place and that they serve fresh Ipswich Clams (those, if you are not familiar with, are tops!) ... so we were happy to find good home seafood in Florida.\n\nI got the fried clams, and wife got the lobstah roll.  Well, based on all the great reviews I am reading here, we must have caught a really bad day.  The service, and our server, were good.  The food was not!  We live on fried clams and lobstah back home, and I've never had such chewy clams.  Actually took 3 of them out of my mouth to throw away.  My wife's lobstah roll was tasty, but much chewier than it should have been ... maybe overcooked a little.\n\nSo, we left disappointed in our $50+ lunch (more than we spend back home, but afterall they have to have it shipped here).  I guess by all the great reviews they are getting you might want to give them a try.  We will look elsewhere!",

  "text": "My husband & I came here last night for a work Christmas party.  We had a fixed menu.  Chips and salsa ( nothing fancy), guac ( husband said it had no flavor except lime).  We ordered the filets.  Best Filet I've ever had.  But that was the only positive of the restaurant.  I wanted to plan another trip to try things on the menu ...but the service was horrendous!!!  We were given wrong drink orders, or waited 20+ minutes for the correct one.  Once the food came our waiter (Jeffrey) never waited on us again.  All our waters were empty from when we received our food until desert FINALLY came.  Great steak but extremely disappointed in the lack of service from our waiter.  It was too bad because we did want to visit again, and now we will take our business elsewhere.  For a several hundred dollars tab, we should have had superb service, not an annoyed waiter.  2 stars because of the horrible service.",

  "text": "We've driven by here several times crossing the waterway and outdoor seating on the water is always a huge plus for us.\n\nMy husband found a Groupon for Salty Rim and thought it was a great opportunity to give them a try.\n\nI originally thought the parking area on the water was there space and quickly learned it was a watercraft storage and launch and that they share the lot on the other side of the building (with the Italian restaurant, bar and a few small shops); on a Friday night, it was pretty crowded and hard to find a space.\n\nOnce we found a space we made our way between the buildings to the entrance, met the hostess and were seated. The inside seating was completely empty with about 8 people at the bar.\n\nThe inside is really cute with a nautical feel and the mixed wood on the walls adds a really interesting (in a good way) look to the space.\n\nWe opted to sit outside - it was 60 degrees out and they had plastic tarps above the fence to block the wind and several propane space heaters near guest tables.\n\nThere were about three other tables outside and another 8-10 people at the outside bar. (not nearly as crowded as the other places we've passes in St Pete Beach and I'm still not sure why. \n\nThey had a guy playing guitar and singing outside, who was actually very good, and I'm sure he froze his butt off. The heater near our table did the trick and kept us comfortable during dinner. The only turnoff to outside dining was that people were allowed to smoke at the outside bar with the smoke blowing over to the dining tables.\n\nOur server approached the table, offered drinks, took our order and split... when she NO, so we ordered.\n\nMy husband ordered the Fish and Chips and I ordered a small house salad with balsamic vinaigrette and the Drunken Mussels. She did ask if I preferred the salad first.\n\nOur server refilled our soft drinks (diet Coke and iced tea - $2.49) and told us food would be out shortly. In a few minutes, she returned with all of our food; pretty quickly, but then again it was really quiet. \n\nMy husband's Fish and Chips ($14.00) was a BIG piece of cod, the batter was light, crispy and not too tick; the menu says it's a Jamaican ginger beer, but the flavor was really faint. It came with a nice pile of crispy fries and blueberry cole slaw. The blueberry cole slaw was a small cup of regular, creamy cole slaw with about four blue berries on top; nothing unique.\n\nMy Drunken Mussels ($12.00) were a pretty big portion (its listed as an appetizer) with a really nice garlicky tomato broth - the ONLY drawback to this dish was that it is listed as coming with garlic toast points; it actually came with two, tiny, thin, crispy slices of baguette. The really delicious broth left in the bowl really needs a big hunk of bread to sop it up.\n\nThe small House Salad ($4.00) was HUGE, mixed greens, wedges of tomato, sliced cucumber, onion and some croutons. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing had a great flavor.\n\nOur server checked in brought our check, applied the Groupon and disappeared. She was sweet; but I'm kind of old school I want to know your name, suggest a cocktail or appetizer (even to share), suggest SOMETHING. If it's this slow I can't imagine not taking the time to increase the check.\n\nTo that end, the oddest part of dinner was the check - at the bottom, like many places there are 'suggest tips'. Most places list 15%, 18% and 20% calculations. This bill listed \"Average\", \"Great\" and \"Super!\", the odd part was that the calculations were 15%, 20% and 25%... I'd like to think that the average tip for their servers as closer to 20%, but at least 18%!\n\nWe're likely to give it another chance as the food was pretty good, the portions were really great for the price and there are some things there I'd still like to try.",

It is definitely the after party spot for all the wedding guests staying in block rooms. Given the crowds and the bar otherwise being nothing special, I would avoid as a late night destination except for convenience if you're staying in the hotel. I also had some strange experiences with the servers and bartenders at night. They ran out of clean glasses   and we had to wait for our drinks. Not a problem, except when they finally brought them they did so without the water my friend requested. She asked again and they responded that there were no clean glasses...while making another alcoholic drink in one. They were clearly prioritizing the paid drinks but it was obvious and rude. They also said told us they couldn't communicate with the kitchen and serve food which also seemed odd. \n\nBrunch was decent. I had a chicken and waffles special that was nicely spiced.

The service was very quick even for a packed Friday night. The portions were generous. We split calamari and spring rolls as our appetizers and ordered separate spicy beef noodle soups, all very delicious. The Vietnamese coffee is a must! It basically a black hole in a cup. Think Turkish coffee to the power of ten, which if that's not how you take your coffee, you can get it with sweetened condensed milk. Being my first experience I can't really say wether it was overpriced or cheap as far pho restaurants go. It is a very open dining room which wasn't very conducive for conversation. As we ate and talked I could hear the nearby tables conversations as well which was distracting. The restrooms were clean, but average and they were out of paper towels. There's plenty of parking out front, but the place can be a little difficult to find because they have a small sign out front.",

Instead, the food comes out on a large plate with a handful of items such as miso soup, salad, california roll, some vegetables, and some dumplings. I got the Chicken Katsu (fried) over rice for my bento box entree, and it wasn't even crispy.",

I was a bit apprehensive to come as it was a bit late 7:45 or so but hey we were very hungry and this was the place we had decided to dine. The place has clothe table covers and I am a fan....it just dresses the place up! When we arrived the folks directed us to pick any table (I am told this a family ran and worked restaurant)....a lady followed us as we picked a table and she wiped it down although it was very clean. Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly, he kept our glasses full while we waited for our meals. ...be prepared to wait a bit for the food as it is fresh and yummy, which makes the waiting worth it!!!  We had ...well see the photos and you will see that is was all good!!!",

I explained our situation; We needed flooring installed in a vacation condo and would not be in town for weeks.  We needed the flooring so we could use our bedrooms and set up furniture.  Mark was excellent -- he came right over to the condo, reviewed the situation, made recommendations, and gave us an estimate.  I trusted him with the keys!  And sure enough, he got the job done quickly, efficiently, and even came in under the original estimate.  Excellent service!  I had friends recommend JB's, and they had used them multiple times over the years and had been pleased.

Since we came to eat and talk with friends, and not attend a concert, we had to leave the place and find another nearby restaurant. In this case, we were very happy with the Wine Exchange and Bistro.

The hostess originally  wanted to sit a 4 year old in a bar chair. I kindly let her know this wasn't appropriate - especially when there was a table available for us to sit comfortably. The restaurant was pretty bright, which i liked, i could easily see the menu. There wasn't a wide variety of beer or wine maybe 7 options combined. This wasn't an issue but I'm hoping soon they will pick up a contract with a local distillery. \n\nThe food was ok. I loved the smothered seitan! But, the macaroni and  cheese needed a lot of help. I've been to other vegan restaurants in the past and noticed this same issue. It just doesn't compare.. it could be the milk they use or just the cheese substitute but it shouldn't be apart if the menu until perfected. The mashed potatoes were ok, they needed a little more seasoning but overall it was good.  The gravy taste great but looked very thick. \n\nOverall my experience was ok. I'll definitely go back and try different options! The only reason this review is a 4 and not a 3 is because i really want to see this restaurant be great! I know with time it has the potential to be amazing!",

And as messy as the place looks when you walk in, everything is actually very well organized. They also have books in many languages. \n\nThe second floor has plenty of small nooks for you to hide away and preview any books you will be purchasing.

  "text": "I stayed here for 3 nights during a conference in November. These are some things I liked about the place:\n1. The cookies that they gave during check-in. Those were great and came in very handy the first night when I was craving a late-night snack and the following morning when I did not get the chance to get breakfast and simply had a cookie, along with coffee that I could make in the room.\n2. While Wi-fi wasn't provided for free to everyone, the bar was set fairly low. All you had to do was to provide your Hilton Rewards number and you could have access to wi-fi for free. While this means that people who haven't signed up have to do so to get the free wifi, it is still infinitely better than having to pay $11.99 or however much it is that Sheraton or Marriott wants to charge me when I spend one night at their hotels.\n\nHere are some things that were not so great about the place:\n1. The poor quality of the sound-proofing: I was on the 23rd floor of the hotel and yet the road noise from below was enough to bother me on two of the nights that I stayed at the hotel. That is one of my biggest peeves about hotels - if they invest in sound proofing their rooms, they can help their guests get a better night's sleep but some choose not to invest in that consciously. I have stayed at hotels on the Las Vegas strip where in spite of all the ruckus going on below, the rooms themselves were practically noise-free.\n2. The quality of the food: Overall, very unimpressive. We had two lunches at the conference catered by the hotel and they were not inspiring. One of the lunches was better than the other but in general, they were not great. On the last day of the conference, I also ordered room service and again, I was not happy with the taste of the food. I had sausages that were overcooked to the point of being burnt; the scrambled eggs I had were not fluffy or well-seasoned - all in all, not the kind of food that makes you either happy or excited.\nI stayed here for the sole reason that the conference was happening here. Given a choice to freely pick across hotels, this wouldn't be my first choice in the area by a long shot.",

  "text": "Verdict: It's not the original but it's not a bad alternative at the airport.\n\nThis place is located in the outskirts of the airport terminals, in what seems to have the local food offerings. You'll also find the Philadelphia Pretzel Factory right across the food court. The Tony Luke's here isn't cheap by any stretch but you'll pay the premium when in need of a Philly fix.\n\nI loved going to the original Tony Luke's before they started popping up everywhere. They made a decent cheesesteak but you could get that in a lot of places in Philly. This place probably does a better job than most with their pork sandwiches.\n\nLooking for that familiar flavor, I ordered the roast pork with broccoli rabe. There wasn't anything really on the lighter end but I did find and order the cooked spinach side dish. The sandwich was exactly what I expected and I enjoyed every bite. The spinach side was tiny and a bit salty but otherwise good.\n\nEven though this terminal is at the far end, there's a shuttle that brings you right here from one of the more central locations. If you have the time and crave some more authentic local cuisine, this place might be worth the trip.",

One girl started my nails by giving me a tiny dish of cold water to soak my cuticles in, no soap. Without explanation, she disappeared and 10 minutes later someone else came over to continue. The technician took her tool box (which was not lined or clean) from working on someone next to me, did a quick douse with soap and water and began to use them on my hands. I asked her if that was the typical sanitation procedure, and she said yes. Very unsanitary, as they should be disinfecting and sanitizing.

The restaurant was inviting but only a few tables were occupied on what should have been a busy Friday night. After dining there, my guess is because the service is not the best. It took a bit for someone to come over and take our drink order by the time they did, we were ready to order our food from an extensive menu. The menu has many great offerings for those who are vegetarian or love seafood along with other meat options as well. We tried the Shrimp spring rolls which were excellent. You get five of them for about $6 and it is the perfect amount for an appetizer. Our main meal arrived and it was delicious as well, though it was not quite enough to eat for my brother. He ordered one of the seafood items while I went for a vegetarian option. I ordered a Pad Sun Wen which was a perfect amount for me; I even took some home. The Thai iced tea is also delicious and was my favorite part of the whole trip. We never were asked if we wanted refills and the only time someone came by, was to drop off our food, drinks or the check. I did observe that this place seemed to do a lot of carry out and perhaps that is the way to go.",

  "text": "I have always loved Frost Gelato, but tonight there was truly something wrong with the gelato. I ordered my usual Gianduia-Chocolate with Hazelnut & it has never tasted like this before. My husband ordered a peanut butter and that was also not same flavor as before ( it had too much creme and not much peanut butter flavor, almost tasting like milk. My gelato tasted tart and something was off about it.   I had my husband taste my gelato as well as I tasted his and we both agreed there is something not right tonight.\nSo I went inside to tell the very young person behind the counter about how it tasted tart and not fresh. He turned and said to me, \" well, we haven't changed the tray yet\" Then he tells me that different Frost's locations sometimes have different colors/tastes and depends on \"chef\" who makes it & that it could taste different. I never heard anything like this before. This young \"boy\" offered me another one, but after his explanation I told him no longer interested and that I was throwing my gelato away in the garbage-and did so in front of him. He never said I will refund you.  He just watched me toss an entire cup away as did my husband. I did not care about the money but the fact he made excuses for something that was not right-is just wrong.\nThis is what happens to any good place turns into a Franchise. Any Pastry Chef will tell you making Desserts are like a science. Each measurement must be done right or it will never turn out the same. \nThere must be a recipe they have to follow as well. \nSorry Frost, I have supported you since you opened in Tucson but now, I will not eat Gelato in Tucson. \nI love gelato and fortunately I do travel, so I will have to wait to have my gelato when I return to Italy.",

The dipping sauce is spicy oil. Naturally.\nThrice-fried chicken: tiny bite-sized spicy white-peppery nuggets lost in a pile of hot chilies that I didn't really have the guts to eat. Comes with a side of steamed rice, which is essential to survive eating in this joint, where everything is spicy. \nComing from the Manhattan branches of Han Dynasty, this giant restaurant is a welcome change!",

Both had great flavor and very good portions. Very spacious and we were sat immediately, even though the place was packed. Great drinks as well! Was not disappointed and definitely worth another visit!",

  "text": "Though I was totally enamored by the idea of being served dishes crafted by an Iron Chef (Jose Garcia), I thought the dishes were a bit lacking. I thought that the head chef for the day was a bit heavy-handed with the seasoning. I get it, you want each dish to pack a punch but there's magic in the subtleties of combining flavors that make your taste buds dance. Maybe my expectations for the Iron Chef were too high... I'll check back in when I try my favorite Iron Chef's restaurant (Michael Simon). ;) \n\nOther than shattering the pedestal I placed Garcia on, the experience and ambiance of the restaurant was so romantic. It definitely made me give my date some brownie points for surprising me with an ad hoc dinner here during my very short visit to Philly. :)",

  "text": "Having gone to this popular establishment multiple times with friends and colleagues, I can comfortably say that Han Dynasty is...ok, not great, but not bad either.\n\nMy recommendation is to get the Han Dynasty tasting menu option as it comes with so much food that you'd be waddling your way with the inevitable food coma. Of the menu items, I recommend the dan dan noodles, the twice fried (insert protein here, but I like the fish), and the eggplants. The food that didn't live up to expectation were the pork buns (really dry meat), the rabbit w/peanuts (which was more like peanut with rabbit bones) appetizer, and the dumplings in chili oil (more carbs than protein). The other dishes, like the bak choy and mapu tofu were standard.\n\nOne of the main reason why I was disappointed at Han Dynasty was the lack of communication between the staff for large party organizations. I called ahead 1 month in advance to prepare a dinner with specific food and spices request due to individual preferences. When I arrived on that evening, the waiter had no idea of the previous arrangement, and I spent 15 minutes trying to re-order the entire menu and we ended up getting multiple dishes with the wrong level of spices and excessive amount of meat dishes even though we had multiple vegetarians in our group.\n\nI think at the end of the day Han Dynasty isn't bad, but if you're trying to impress a native Chinese foodie, there is much room for improvement.\n\nFood: 3 stars\nPrice: 3 stars\nService: 2 stars\nAmbiance: 2 stars (very stuffy, despite the tall ceilings)",

They were a pleasure to work with and were more than accommodating with every request. They went above and beyond. They listened carefully and cared a lot about what I wanted -- from beverages to music, they made sure all of my wants were met, with sincerity.

  "text": "I messaged Fixit on a Sunday, before they were even open for the day about my aging laptop. My precious MacBook had decided on Friday evening to not fully boot up. My goggling on my phone lead to dead ends and I was losing my mind by Sunday as nothing I did would work. They messaged back within minutes. Their Veterans BLVD location is less than a mile from my house. They had no one to look at it on Sunday, so I gave them my information and a deposit. Monday after work, I stopped by and the technician was looking at it. Tuesday morning, they call me and tell me it was repaired. With the discount at check in on YELP, the whole bill was less than $100, and they did not have to wipe my hard drive clean. Yes, my laptop was purchased in 2010, but they were completely non-judgmental I so appreciated that. Yes, I know that I should not have put money into something so old and outdated, but I really dislike change, even something as minor as a laptop. I don't really use it all that much for anything but iTunes and my iPod (please don't judge me for that, I will NOT go to the iPhone and all that entails).\n\nThey were honest and did not bat any eye about my grandmother of a laptop. I will probably suck it up eventually and get a new laptop and transfer all of my music over. They do repair the iPhone, but do not repair any other phones of any sort. I hope to never come back, but if the need arises, I will know where to go, and I will refer everyone hear and shout their good news from the tree tops. Great customer service. Fast and affordable. I am grateful for this place.",

They allowed me to test drive the car overnight and I let them know that they should go ahead and draw up the paperwork; I'd be in to sign them in the morning if there were no issues.

I left their car on the lot and drove mine home.\nAbout a month later I realized that I had left my inflatable kayak in the hatch of their car.  When I called, they took my information but claimed they didn't have it.\nGood luck inflating the boat, crooks.  I had one of the necessary bits for proper inflation at home.",
