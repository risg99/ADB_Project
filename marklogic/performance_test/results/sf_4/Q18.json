For 9 out of the last 10 summers, the air conditioning has not worked at all, even when it's 105 degrees outside. \nLocal staff has no ability to fix anything, and \"Customer Service\" at the corporate level is non-existent. You can't even get through to talk to anyone, they refuse to let you contact management, and they are totally unresponsive. This is just a big corporation run by bean counters trying to cut costs at all costs. They don't care about their members at all. Unless you like it really, really HOT when you work out, find another gym.",

I went to inquire about potential personal training lessons at this location and sat with a manager named Stuart who proceeded to tell me all about the process and the costs and formalities. As I was dressed in workout clothes hoping to have a trial session that day he then started profusely at my chest area and made an extremely vulgar comment that I won't post on here but then also referred to them as my \"assets\". I was mortified and felt reduced to an object by this individual and exited practically in tears. Trust me their corportate offices will be emailed about this incident as well!",

As a national gym, I would expect the staff to take ownership and routinely wipe down equipment. I cant speak on behalf of ladies, but the mens lockeroom is gross.\n\nStaff just roam around and crack jokes with each other. They're just there to clock in, clock out, and get paid. \n\nCanceling my membership was the most annoying part of my entire experience. No Customer Service # and the only way to cancel is by going to the gym in person or sending a letter via certified mail. \n\nI guess it was my own mistake for expecting more out of a membership that only cost me .70 a day.\n\nKudos to you Planet Fitness on renting space, throwing fitness equipment in there with some staff and getting away with calling it a legitimate business franchise.",

  "text": "The main recreation center is in line with the reputation of the University of Arizona. State-of-the-arc facility that includes an ample amount of cardio equipment: elliptical, arc trainers, treadmills, recumbent bikes, stationary bikes, stair masters, and row machines. The facility includes two separate basketball gymnasiums with a total of five basketball courts. Four racquetball courts, an Olympic swimming pool, a massage station, outdoor volleyball, pool and ping pong tables, and so much more! \n\nThe reason it doesn't deserve the maximum five stars is because much of the equipment to work out the body are outdated. All the cardio equipment is up-to-date and I don't know why there is inconsistency with some of the other machines. Regardless, this is a center that can match any fitness goal and cater to different needs and interests. Plenty of exercise classes to choose from! \n\nIf you are the general public, then you won't be able to call this your gym. I'm sure if that was the case, thousands of more people would want to work out here. As for the students, alumnus, and employees of the UA, get the most out of your association with the University and commit to fitness at the center!",

  "text": "Four stars because a signature club should at least provide bottled water too since they have towel service like Lifetime Fitness. That's my only complaint really. Since this location is in South Tampa where parking is very limited in this specific part of town, the parking garage is great. There's plenty of parking here. \n\nIt's a two story building with weights on the 2nd floor and cardio machines on 1st floor. I came in during lunchtime and there was plenty of weight equipment with little to no wait. Tons of cardio machines. There's also a smoothie bar on the first floor that has supplements, fit for life meals along with smoothies. Since this was a fairly new gym all the equipment was newer and clean. The 2nd floor has every weight machine or equipment you could ask for from free weights to machine weights. Yeah there are a lot of young, fit people but you can't let that bother you. Everyone was a beginner at one point so don't let that or the place intimidate you. There are also trainers ready to help you if you are just starting out so don't be afraid to ask. \n\nI wished there was a signature club in the Tampa/Clearwater area since I do pay for it.",

They have a lot of machines to choose from, and I especially love the circuit machines. You can work out for 39-45 mins and work out your entire body! This location beats any of the locations in Philadelphia.\nLove the fact that I pay only 20 dollars a month and I get to bring a guest with me every time to the gym. I also save on drinks and can buy them for half off compared to the other members who pay 10 dollars a month. I also can utilize the tanning beds and massage chairs as much as I want to.

After leaving OTF you feel great! It's very addicting. My resting heart rate was around 55 before joining OTF in December and has since dropped to around 47. Max heart rate during exercise has also increased in that timeframe, best of both worlds. Before OTF when I would swim a 400m fast, I would always feel winded during and after the swim. Last time doing the swim, halfway through I realized that I was breathing calm and feeling a lot of energy, I ended with the best time on my 400 yet. Each trainer is great, especially: Rebecca, Katie, Sandy, Zach, Lani and Miranda. The atmosphere is wonderful, from the music to the other daily members.

Try the We-Fit class, but expect a huge challenge, even if you are fit.

The instructors and staff are beyond amazing and really make the experience stand out. They're helpful with your bike set-up, friendly and genuinely care about you. Within only a few classes, each of the instructors that I have taken with remembered my name, which definitely gives the studio more of a \"family\" feel and makes me motivated to go back. The instructors I've had have absolutely rocked. If you are into newer music and instructors that change the exercise depending on the song then Shoshanna, Jess and Russel are the ones for you. I've also taken with Kevin and Barry and enjoyed their classes as well. They both seem to teach based on longer intervals throughout the 45-60 min class -- I found those classes a little less intense, but great if you aren't looking for a crazy cardio workout.

  "text": "ORANGETHEORY FITNESS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE!\n\nI know it's a bold statement...but I'm 100% serious.\n\nI first heard about Orangetheory Fitness in the Spring of 2014, when I read about the killer workouts in a popular magazine. It sounded amazing--but there was a big problem: I didn't live within 100 miles of the nearest studio (tragic, I know).\n\nFast forward to Winter 2016 when I moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, and passed a sign which read: \"Orangetheory Fitness.\" The name instantly rang a bell--I had been meaning to try this workout for years!!! So I called the Tyrone Studio, and headed in to try a complementary session the next day!\n\nThat's when my life changed. \n\nI've always enjoyed workout classes, and I've tried several--from cycling to Pilates to barre. While they're enjoyable, and promote good fitness--they don't necessarily \"push\" you to work outside your comfort zone. Orangetheory Fitness is FINALLY a class where you can't \"cheat the system\" or fake your commitment to the workout! By wearing a heart rate monitor, which tracks your results on a large screen during the entire class (don't be intimidated--participants tend to stay focused on their own numbers), OTF encourages you to push yourself in ways most classes simply do not (without hurting yourself, of course).\n\nA typical Orangetheory class at Tyrone holds up to 24 people, and consists of 25-30 minutes on the treadmill (running, or walking at an incline); rowing; and exercises in a weight room. The HIIT of class promotes \"after burn\", as well--so the theory is you will continue to burn calories for several hours after class ends (although eating several slices of cake is still not advised).\n\nI usually take 2-3 classes a week, and with consistency, I've had GREAT results! My running has improved drastically, and I've lost 11 pounds (and counting) since joining the OTF Tyrone community this winter. \n\nOrangetheory Tyrone is a great community with fabulous coaches (teachers), and they sometimes have great specials on classes--making them more affordable, as well. I am so glad I discovered OTF--I can confidently say it is the best decision I ever made for my fitness and my fitness goals (and I've had several personal trainers, too)!!!!\n\nSo...for those reasons, I'd say Orangetheory Fitness Tyrone deserves 5 stars in my book! \n\nP.S. If you're on the fence about trying OTF--know this: you'll never know what you're capable if you don't try. And if you feel \"lost\" or overwhelmed during your first class, do not be intimated! The more you go, the classes will become much easier to follow along! :)",

  "text": "I was a member here and cancelled my membership because it go too expensive, the equipment was ALWAYS broken or dirty, and because the gym itself was disgusting most of the time. Also, the staff is incredibly pushy even after you are a member, they will not leave you alone to get personal training.  I was in the middle of a workout one time, with my headphones on, and one of the salespeople motioned for me to take out my headphones so he could tell me about the personal training they offered.  I was beyond annoyed.  I went into the ladies bathroom one Saturday when I arrived and found only one toilet that was \"clean\". I told the front desk staff (every trash can throughout the gym was also overflowing) and they told me that their cleaning lady did not come in that weekend.  I couldn't understand why that meant the rest of the staff could not clean up a little and at least empty the trash.  That was the final straw for me.  I would recommend any other gym in the area, but stay far, far away from this one.",

  "text": "I've been a member for about 5 years now and the facility has gone downhill noticeably. The staff is indifferent. On any given day half a dozen treadmills don't work. And not all of the ones that aren't working have  a sign on them saying they're out of service but when you actually run on them the deck cuts off and on very quickly making it impossible to continue the workout. This could be dangerous. Half of the audio devices on the treadmills connecting to the TV's don't work so don't count on listening to the televisions.  You would think one of those bored staff members would actually get on a piece of equipment and actually test them to see if they work. Including the audio.  On any given day one of the three giant overhead fans isn't working. I have the Black Card membership and visit other PF's around the country when I travel for work and I have to say the Pottstown facility is the worst I've been to so far.  This place is in need of a big refresh - management, staff, and equipment. The only reasons I give it 2 stars is the reasonable cost of membership and the potential to turn it around.",

  "text": "Just left a class here with Lindsay(?). I was so excited to attend this studio using my new Classpass, but I have to be honest: it was slightly underwhelming. We spent 20 of the 45 minutes actually on the rowers. The other 25 min was spent doing wall sits (with 5 lb weights), air squats, and lunges using a paper plate. While I did break a dripping sweat, I would attribute it to those exercises vs the actual rowing (and that I'm no Ironman triathlete either...). My heart rate remained at around 110-120, where it would be a 180+ at a spin class. I think I will attend another class with a different instructor to see if the workout changes. I was also disturbed that when I first entered the studio to the front desk, I was the only person there and the front desk person/this instructor did not even look up or address me until about what seemed like an eternity and until I said something to her first. First impression really damaged by that. \nThe studio? I would personally update the look so meet the standards of these trendy fitness boutiques, but then again, you're here to workout, not be aesthetically pleased, right?! \n\nIf I could speak to the owner, I would say that changing their music selection and turning up the volume would improve scores immensely, as this seems to be a common complaint. Increase the enthusiasm of the instructors and add more rowing to the class versus body weight exercises that I can do at home! \n\nSide note-they are exclusive to Classpass and won't be doing Fitmob- fyi\n\n\nAddendum: the day after, I am feeling a little sore! So, good workout at the end of the day!",

All the employees that I've encountered are friendly and always talk to me when arrive and leave. They also are COVID conscious and have sanitizing wipes all over the gym and in the cardio section they have every other cardio machine on to keep a six feet distance. Also every person I've seen at the gym keeps their mask on and respects people space. They also have a 85 person capacity so people are not on top of each other. I've read the other reviews about the billing issues with the gym and I personally haven't encountered anything yet but I also wasn't a member before covid. Lastly I am so happy they are remaining open because gyms are essential in my opinion!",

Beware, in the time of Covid, you must reserve your class and you HAVE TO cancel within 2 hours or you'll be charged a fee of a buck since I canceled 1 hour in advance.  Oh well, lessons learned.\n\nThe instructors are young and witty, enthusiastic and keep this bag of bones young at heart, mind and soul.  I really like the energy.

Pedal hard\" I'm not even kidding. And the music? If I was closer to the door I would have left, it was so loud It was literally hurting my ears and it was hardcore rap the entire time! It's a different kind of bike than I'm used to also and seems to be hurting my back. What I miss most about flywheel is their ability to track your progress so you can see how your doing, and reserve a certain bike.

As another reviewer stated, I feel as if I am interrupting their social hour when I check in to work out. Occasionally I will receive a greeting depending on which staff member is working. Other times good luck finding a staff member, let alone a greeting. Then there are the days when the staff is so busy having their own personal conversations that they don't even know you're there. The other day the staff was having so much fun at the front desk that I could hear them yelling and hollering from across the gym. I thought I was at a bar watching a football game. \n    The maintenance has gotten slightly better than it was previously. Don't bother going on a hot day. This gym refuses to run their air-conditioning. If you happen to bother to ask about it, you will be directed to a \"manager\" and then told that the AC is broken and that they are not sure when it will be fixed. So be prepared to workout in a 90+ degree gym.\n   I wish this 24 hour fitness would take lessons from their south Reno counterpart. If you don't have to go to this gym, then don't. There are many nicer and cheaper gyms in Reno that will actually make you feel welcome, are clean, and have newer well maintained equipment.",

  "text": "Where to start? I have been a member of L.A. Fitness for about 11 years now ranging from various locations from Norristown to Collegeville, so that should tell you that overall I am pleased with L.A. Fitness.\n\nI am going to start off with the positive by saying that this place is extremely affordable and they have pretty much everything you are looking for in a work out. \n\nI typically go at lunch due to it's proximity to my employer, and I will say that is the only reason I go to this location. Around lunchtime there is a moderate, but not overbearing crowd. I typically can get in a workout with light cardio in a little over an hour. \n\nThe staff seems friendly and the equipment in the workout area is well maintained.\n\nThe bad thing(s) about this location, or why I rated it so bad is that there is absolutely zero pride in appearance. The men's locker room is trashed and by trashed I mean that roughly 30% of the lockers are broken. For this reason I would never bring valuables; i.e., my wallet in there. There used to be a scale, but that too is broken/missing. \n\nNext, the free weight area is mostly disheveled with dumbbells loosely scattered throughout the location. People also like to leave a water bottle or sweatshirt on benches or equipment to claim it. Meanwhile they are off bullsh*tting or working out on something else. This drives me, and I am sure other members insane. Plates are rarely re-racked and just left on equipment. This usually leaves it a guessing game if somebody is actually using the equipment. \n\nMy biggest pet peeve is SOME PEOPLE for some reason REFUSE to wipe down equipment after using it. Why? Seriously! They have like 10 different locations to get a paper towel and sanitize solution to wipe the equipment down. \n\nI am not going to say this doesn't happen at other locations, it is just more often here that this kind of crap happens. \n\nThe employees need to hold members accountable for the above complaints. \n\nOutside of that gripe, it is a good gym for the price. You just have to be able to tolerate some of the crap to get the benefit. \n\nThe Collegeville location is far superior, but I am not about to hit the gym between the hours of 5-7 pm and the weekends are not for working out. They are for doing the things that make you feel guilty enough to work out.....",

  "text": "I've been a member of Philadelphia Sports Club in Ardmore for a few years now but decided to get a Planet Fitness membership as well since they are 24 hrs during the week and it's so cheap. A lot of my friends have Planet Fitness memberships too so I get to work out with them when I go there. \n\nPlanet Fitness is to Philadelphia Sports Club what a cup of coffee is to a grande skinny half-caf caramel macchiato. At Planet Fitness you get machines. That's it. If you upgrade to the black membership, you can use one of their two (2?!) massage chairs or carcinogenic tanning booths. Because of the low cost, you get a motley group of people that join (students, crazy people, moms, crazy people...). There are a bunch of TVs at the front of the non-description 2nd flr old office space that are always on sports channels (no HGTV here). My main complaint has to be the staff. They obviously don't care about their job and never acknowledge your presence.\n\nI don't know about you but I would much rather pay a little more and go to Philadelphia Sports Club in Ardmore which is gorgeous (located in an old movie theater), has a steamroom, yoga classes, kickboxing, spinning, tvs on most machines and super friendly, helpful staff.  I can also use the PSC Radnor pool at non-peak hours which is great. \n\nIt goes to show you get what you pay for. I will defiantly keep my PSC membership. Mt PF membership? Not so much.",

  "text": "I have been going to Psychosomatic Fitness since January. I don't have any experience to compare to. I just needed to change things, and with the help of Matt, Arnold, Josh and sometimes Brad I'm getting there. Initially I started with a 3week trial package and I then signed up for more permanent membership. Since there are always membership drives for the group classes I've signed up for, the classes can vary in size from 5-16 people. Psychosomatic Fitness offers classes as early as 5 am and as late as 6:30pm during the week and two sessions on Saturday morning at 8 and 9am. They are closed Sunday.\nIt's not at all easy but overall if you are willing to do the work, they provide the tools to help you reach your goals. No two sessions are the same, it is always a mix up of various things. \nI started out with a right foot injury and a left knee strain. So when it's time for certain sets, like box jumps, which pretty quickly hurt my knee, I tell them I need an alternative and they find alternatives to make sure I'm working what I need to without hurting myself. As hard as some sessions have been, I haven't injured myself and I've had success in losing weight and getting into better shape.",

  "text": "Overall I like this gym more than the smaller Hyde Park Village option and it's less than $10 a month more so it's a deal in this area. There are plenty of pros about this signature gym, especially compared to other options around South Tampa. I go at various times and I have never had to wait for a machine, although the free weights upstairs do tend to get very busy and you will be waiting at peak hours. The pool and hot tub are always clean and I love how the lanes are set up for splits (two people can do laps in same lane), the sauna could be much hotter (avg. is 162 and it needs to be about 170), but it's always clean, and the showers/locker rooms (for guys anyway) are again, always clean. I've never had my stuff moved or my locker opened or anything stolen and I consider this a plus and they have a TV for every locker row which I appreciate. The scheduling of classes seems to hit the majority of work schedules and I have taken over 20 spin classes and like everything, some of the instructors are good and some are better. They even play the background music pretty low (except for those loud, obnoxious sales days where the group fitness companies get to come in), the food and drinks at the smoothie bar are good and the service there is always friendly. \nI do have a couple of cons though: the parking is frustrating! Tight, and if you go during peak hours be prepared to wait in a long line, come close to getting clipped around corners from juiced up necks in their beer-bro trucks, and I've almost hit a few pedestrians in that garage myself. It's craziness during the peak hours! They need to wipe down the racquetball courts more often - they are more slippery than other courts and that's an ankle injury waiting to happen. My biggest gripe is the staff at the front desk, and even a few trainers. The front desk are simply clueless. I was told recently that I couldn't schedule a racquetball court less than 8 days ahead of time (this was wrong), it took 20 minutes to get a receipt for a league I was signing up for, they seem to play on their phones instead of watch for the herds of people coming in to check in, and just last weekend I was dropping off a cancellation form for a friend and the desk girl said they simply wouldn't take it, wouldn't even drop it in the mail for me, I had to mail it myself to the California office (it says right on the form to drop it off at any club). They are almost useless. Over by the trainer area the trainers have their clients running almost full speed up and down the elliptical and treadmill rows and that is ridiculously unsafe and I can't believe they allow it. The TV's on the cardio machines are hit and miss and there's no way to tell what is going to work or not until your set up and running already. It's a big place though with plenty of space and equipment to do your thing without any hassles in the least. Overall, the best gym I've paid for and a real deal for the money in the South Tampa area. Also a shout out to Ron who gave me and my girlfriend great deals to move from the Hyde Park location to Signature - well worth the time and money for a gym.",

As many earlier reviews state, the opening wasn't smooth sailing, but every issue I had was quickly addressed and resolved. Customer care goes a really long way and it certainly hasn't gone unnoticed. \n\nThe variety of equipment and machines here is glorious. I have found that in just a few short months, I have been able to challenge myself with new exercises out of sheer curiosity for exploring everything the gym has to offer. Absolutely nothing here comes in small supply - from the equipment, to the number of water stations, to lockers and cleaning wipes - I never feel like I'm waiting to use something. \n\nAnd perhaps my most favorite thing is the water massage chairs! Nothing feels better than a tiny \"treat yo'self\" session after a good workout. Kudos to the Crunch Reno team for building a facility that truly has its members in mind!",

The cycle class has been the only reason I was hanging on since the cost per month was pretty low.  But this already over-crowded gym doubled their size and took Bally's members on when Bally's closed.  Now it's overly packed, all of the time.  LA Fitness has many disgruntled members from my experience.  I love 1 spin instructor but will have to find another since I cannot even be assured a spot on a bike anymore even when I am there 30 minutes early to sign in.  Policies are not enforced as there seem to be constant complaints.  I have heard for 6 months that they are getting new bikes for cycling.  I came from Golds in Lawrenceville, and NYSC in Princeton...and never have liked this gym.  It's been 'ok' from the start.  But now it's time to quit.

I think these risks are significant enough to invite a strict NO TOLERANCE rule that includes a plan of how it will be enforced. \n\nI would like to see one or more staff members assigned to walking the gym to enforce this essential safety precaution as opposed to all of the wiping I'm seeing.  \n\nI am remaining hopeful that Clayton Center will recognize how vital and essential it is to make certain that this protocol is enforced.  \n\nPeople continue to do as they wish only because they can.",

  "text": "When I moved to Reno, I told myself that I would take the time to take care of me and put myself first and that included getting into a workout routine. When I found Kate in August 2014, I figured that's what I would get but she is SO much more than a personal trainer. She takes the time to assess where you're at, provides literature on current fitness and weight management issues you may be having, and takes the time to follow your nutrition and daily food log. All her workouts are fun, different, and she's so personable and fun that you kind of forget that you're in an intense workout.\n\nI have a torn ACL in my right knee and a recovering fractured left ankle so I used to have so much pain when working out. It really turned me off to exercise because no trainer I worked with before really realized how painful it was. Kate is so incredibly knowledgable about the body and is aware of the dangers of putting too much strain on injuries. She has been focusing on my foundational balance abilities and strengthening the muscles around my knee and ankle so that I can increase my training. It has definitely worked and I can feel how much stronger I am all around. She takes the time to work through everything, not just rush through a workout like so many other trainers I've had.\n\nI have lost inches everywhere and am so happy with Kate's skills and talents in helping me get into shape. I can honestly say that I am in the best shape of my life (even more so than when I was an athlete as a teenager). She's affordable, and really works around schedules to accommodate all the other responsibilities we all have in the week. I can't stress enough how much Kate has changed my view on working out, nutrition, and what it means to be fit. You won't be sorry.",

  "text": "This gym is poorly run and for a new gym I expected more.  I was a member there a few  years ago when it opened.  Nobody wiped down the equipment as they should.  Almost every time you would switch to a new machine, bench, whatever, it was covered in sweat.  Sometimes dripping, and not with the spray you're supposed to use.  I brought this to the attention of the front desk and the manager in email.  Very little was done about it and the desk people asked me to point out the individual(s) not wiping the equipment down...right then and there. Yeah, that's smart...let's incriminate people during their work out.  That's bad customer service and I'll likely get my ass kicked.  Cars literally fly in the parking lot.  I've had several close calls of other people hitting me.  The parking lot has a weird design with all these diagonal drive lanes so there are blind spots.  Be careful.\n\nOnly good thing about this place is it's newer.  I've worked out at some rough gyms...don't need this anymore.  Go to Ardmore and do yourself a favor.",

Wedding band, watch, and cell phone were left alone.\n\nAnother gentleman soon walked up with a similarly broken lock - and he was not as fortunate ... he lost a substantial sum (over $1k) and airpods (which when pinged - was supposedly still on the premises at the time). \n\nWhat was concerning was that the response felt acclimated ... that this was not the first/few times it happened.  A first time occurrence usually has a more engaging reaction ... like \"oh my goodness, I can't believe this happened - let me get the manager ASAP!\"  Management was called only after the second person reported a break-in and the loss more substantial.\n\nAlso, the replacement Commercial grade Master locks the guys got? The same model is showing up with more frequency in the locker rooms the past few months.\n\nResolution pending, and I hope this can be transparently resolved so we can have peace of mind in a nice facility. However, I suspect not much will/can be done.\n\nThis will be challenging as folks often come here from work, and have laptops, documents, sensitive information that they place in lockers. I'll be keeping my bag with me from now on.\n\n***Upon digging deeper, we heard that locked lockers have been broken into in the same fashion during the past several months. :/\n\n*** Update: the office saw the updated (short) YELP review and wants to speak with me on my next visit.",

  "text": "Crossfit Renaissance has been open 3-4 years now and Bill runs a top-notch shop. I have worked out in years past at the gym formerly known as Crossfit Philly (now Urban Athlete) and other CF gyms in both the DC and Bay areas. Crossfit Renaissance is on par with every one I've been to, but (for now) has a bigger gym and fewer athletes for a lot more one-on-one focus. \n\nPros: \n- Plenty of parking (this distinguishes it from other Crossfit gyms in the area)\n- It's literally *right* off I-95 and the Betsy Ross bridge, so if you commute on either of these two arteries, it's on your way to /from work.\n- Tons of class times. If working out is a priority for you, there is a class time that will fit your schedule. \n- Bill is super organized and proactive about mentoring/ coaching his athletes. \n- Totally unpretentious go to work atmosphere, which is refreshing (especially if you're new). \n\nCons: \n- For most, it will be price, but... you get what you pay for (for me, it's results I know I won't be able to win on my own at a gym). There are tiered levels of membership to accomodate different budgets (with different allotments of classes/wk at each). \n\nIf you are serious about wanting to make a change, improve your health/ fitness/ stress levels, look no further.",

  "text": "It's crazy that I haven't written my review of this place yet. It's also insane that there are only 2 reviews so far considering how much people seem to love it here. Let me tell you, the love is justified. \n\nMe? I have a love/hate relationship. I hate the workouts when they are over because generally, I'm sore all over. But there is no denying the results.  I've been a runner for a few years now, running 6-8 half marathons a year.  However, at one point, I stopped losing weight.  It might have something to do with not changing my eating habits (I run for bacon), but I plateaued.  Enter Orangetheory Fitness, and I've not only started losing weight, but look better than I have in a long time.\n\nSo what is OrangeTheory?  First, the name - during your workouts, you wear a heart monitor that color codes your heart rate.  Orange is the ideal zone to be in (red is good, too) as the fat burning zone.  So the goal - the theory - is to stay in the orange zone or higher the entire time.  At least, that's how I understand it.  The workouts range from 45 minutes for an express to 90 minutes to an ultra, and in each workout, you will do a certain number of blocks (2-4 of varying lengths) on a treadmill (or elliptical or bike, if running doesn't work for you), a rower, and the weight room.  Treadmill work ranges from moderately strenuous jogs to all-out runs of varying lengths, with occasional inclines.  The workouts include treadmill work for non-runners (walks with larger inclines).  Weight room ranges from some dumbell exercises, to body weights, and TRX strap workouts.  Each class, has a coach guiding you through each routine.\n\nDifferent studios involve different experiences.  So, for example, it is virtually impossible to get into the classes you want to get into at the 4th street, St. Pete, location, because frankly, they have too many members and need to open another location.  The tyrone studio can be hard if you try to book a last minute class, but as long as you book a few days in advance, chances are there will be enough cancellations that you'll get in off the wait-list.  Furthermore, the coach makes all the difference.  I have been to classes where coaches just kind of go through the motions - they don't pay attention to people struggling through the weight room routines, don't correct bad form, and don't encourage.  I have seen coaches only help women, and only younger, prettier, ones, too.  I'm happy to report Tyrone has some awesome coaches.  I have only taken a class or two with a few of them, but have taken a bunch of classes with Matt, Aimee and Kyle, and they are fantastic.  Constant encouragement, extremely helpful with form, and their workouts are awesome.  And by that, I mean their workouts suck and I think they are sadist, but that's only because of how hard they can be.  However, each workout can be done at your speed.  If its too hard for you to bang out 3 sets of each weight room block, then do 2.  It's fashioned for people of all levels, and you get whatever you put into it.\n\nThe rest of the staff is great, too.  Tiffany and Nick at the front desk are extraordinary helpful and easy going when it comes to changing your plan, scheduling/cancelling classes, and billing questions.  There are others, but I am not great at learning people's names.  They're great, too, though.\n\nComplaints?  Price.  This is not a cheap routine.  My $99 plan still only allows me 8 workouts a month, and the next upgrade is $159 for unlimited.  Extra classes are $12, which means as long as I don't take more than 5 extra classes, its not worth upgrading.  And it does get frustrating trying to get into classes and constantly being on the wait-list.  If you can workout in the middle of the day, then those are the easiest to get into.\n\nUntil my girlfriend got me into running 3 years ago, I was 50+ pounds overweight and hadn't done an ounce of exercise outside of walking and occasionally hiking.  Since then, I have tried a couple of different gyms when it's gotten too hot to run, but I mostly used them for treadmill work since weight lifting never produced results for me.  I get discouraged, and stop going.  OTF is different.  I look better, feel stronger, and if I could just leave the carbs and sugar out of the diet, I would be in even better shape.  But I love pizza, and cookies, and cupcakes.  The best part is though, OTF allows me to keep those things in my diet (within reason) and still keep the weight off and muscle on.  \n\nThis is a great routine.",

There are so many different classes to choose from, I just wish I had more time to attend all of them!",

No sales pressure to purchase add on services (massage therapy, tanning, personal training, nutrition counseling, etc.). Large selection of group fitness classes - I just wish they would rotate the times/days since some classes I've wanted to try do not work with my schedule.  Very clean facility and if/when machines are down for repair, they are back up quickly.  Even during peak times, I've never had trouble getting a machine I wanted to use.  I also like that the clientele is of all ages, sizes, and fitness levels.  There is a separate area for serious weight trainers as not to intimidate those of us just looking to slim and tone.  Parking can sometimes be a challenge on Saturday or Sunday mornings when they have a lot of classes and events running, but if you're coming to the gym, finding a close parking spot shouldn't be your perogative (doesn't hurt to walk/warm up on your way in!)",

  "text": "UPDATE:  DO NOT become a member of this gym!!!  I finally came in to fully cancel my membership, which I had on hold for a while.  They said they needed to look up my account to do so and scanned my card, later telling me actually a manager had to be present so that front desk person I spoke to couldn't actually cancel my account anyway.  Was not able to get a hold of a manager for quite a while, turns out for those 6 weeks they had begun charging me full membership again because scanning my card reactivated my membership!  So then I had to call corporate to refund my card (good luck finding that number, it's very buried), even a gym manager can't fix that kind of mistake and literally said I'd have to speak to corporate.  So front desk staff does not seem to know what can reactivate a membership on hold nor do they have the ability to cancel accounts, which is a hassle because a manager must be present to do so.  So be aware if you sign up here it will be damn near impossible to cancel or adjust any false charges.  I fully expect they'll continue to try to charge me even though they swear I'm cancelled, in which case screw them, they can take it up with my credit card company because I'll refute the charges.",

BULLLLLL-SHEEEEEET. I mean, you're not walking through a garbage dump, but it's not a tidy place. Every machine has some sort of trash attached to it whether it's food trash, sweat rags, etc.\n\n2nd issue- Too crowded. If you go at any normal hours (ex: 8 a.m. - 11 p.m.) you can get a machine but it's uncomfortably crowded. I'm glad all of you are working on your fitness, but damn, I don't want your sweat on me. \n\n3rd issue- Not enough variety in machines! Plenty of weights, but not enough cardio. I was spoiled by my old gym, the Bally's on Aramingo, because they had so much to do!\n\nThe good----\n\n1) Super cheap, I mean for the price I can understand why the place is packed like they have free giveaways.\n \n2) The lunk alarm is hilarious.\n\n3) Each machine has a radio/tv channels (9 different channels) attached to the machine. All you need are headphones!\n\n4) Everyone is pretty friendly and keeps to themselves even when it's crowded.\n\nBTW; why am I complaining? I don't even pay to go here!\n\n:)",

To keep up with their ever growing membership, they expanded and added more equipment. I will say that Retro is a clean gym. They are constantly trying to keep up with the bathrooms, as they get a lot of use. Most times I have found it to be acceptable. This is a gym after all. I use the tanning beds on occasion, and once, about a year ago, made a comment to the manager that the fans inside the bed were very dirty. He assured me they would be cleaned that day. To my surprise the next day, they were. They have kept this up, as I was in there last night. \nThey have just about every piece of equipment you would ever want in a gym, and keep them maintained. For cardio, they have the typical treadmill, bicycle, elliptical trio, but all have their own T.V. attached. There is also a theatre room, which has the aforementioned cardio equipment, in a dark theatre with a large screen. They play uncut, full length movies in there. It is nice for a change.\nYou really can't beat this place for $20 a month. I would highly recommend it.",

The classes are a joke - as many have mentioned, their class schedule is really random and classes are often cancelled. \"We Fit\" is a TOTAL JOKE - the 5:30 class has been dangerously over-crowded every time I go. Since there are 25-30 people crammed into a room doing exercises at 10-13 various \"stations,\" it's impossible to know whether you're doing an exercise correctly or just injuring yourself because you can't get the attention of the personal trainer. On that note, the gym's culture is really cliquey and \"bro-y\" - the employees spend more time chit-chatting with one another than helping answer patrons' questions. The woman who worked the desk Monday, May 21st at around 3:30pm was downright rude to me when I asked for a towel. She ignored me, looked over my head at the television, and only gave me the towel when I asked a couple of more times. Basically, the staff are a bunch of cocky jocks who prioritize one another's fitness goals and needs over those of patrons. I was surprised that when \"We Fit\" has been brimming over with bodies, staff have been allowed to remain in the class while patrons will turn themselves away because it's too full.",

  "text": "I think the worst thing about this business is its location, on Sunnyside and just off of Pendleton Pike; now, seeing as my mom lives on that side of town I feel it's fair of me to say, one block in the wrong direction at night? No thanks. And in the day it's not much better. So, the only reason I have gone there is for my daughter's volleyball tournaments. What I LOVE about going to Incrediblex as opposed to the other places that have hosted the tournaments is that they give you a players card worth the amount of your admission fee, $5. The place is really ginormous, soccer, basketball, batting cages, and all this is happening all at once, under one roof! They even have a full service restaurant. No, you can't order a steak and there's no waitress to serve your table, it's deli style ordering with a cute area of umbrella'd tables where you can eat everything from wings to sandwiches. Or, you can sit at the bar and partake in some wine and beer and although this is the only area designated 21 and over, you can drink outside of there as well. I saw dad's with beers in another table area watching sports. And I find it ask kind of funny. Yes, please serve parents alcohol while they watch their kids sporting events then have them drive home, lol! (And I am oneif thoseparents who partook becauae sometime a nice cold beer is just what an all-day volleyball tournament required. But, in all seriousness, no, I think the alcohol and food stuffs is about drawing in the Dave and Busters type of market without the D&B type of price. Unfortunately, they don't have the gaming and high end bar feel the other establishment can brag about;  BUT they have a lot more variety. They have bowling, inflatables, Lazer tag, and when the courts aren't being used the kids and I hopped on a court and played pepper (meaning you can just free-play between games). From what I understand they also have a gym? And open gym for the kids. \n**My only worry was having my teen daughter dropped off for open gym at a place that serves alcohol and has sooooo much to offer. It's a great place.  But as a mom, she likes to go and well the freedom to loiter and wander (20-ish age guys have been \"recruiting\" and now \"befriended\" my 16 year old daughter and her friends for open gym nights) worries me.**\n So, I'm a fan, wish it was closer, think some things might need to be reworked to keep bad situations like young girls being preyed on (precautionary), parking is more than sufficient (if you keep driving past the entrance you'll see that there's a whole lot behind the building (and the exit is one way so you have go that way to leave anyway),and I like how you can roam around watching and even just hanging around until the next game uncorralled (still love that part). As for the staff, tourney and restaurant staff have been courteous and seem to run things smoothly and they're usually busy.  To sum it up, my biggest beef with Incrediblex is its locale,  but, from what I've seen the patrons don't reflect the location, once you're inside you could be anywhere USA. So, would I recommend it? YES.",

  "text": "In Tampa, I would say this I the best place to spin in the city. You can buy your classes and reserve them online. It's usually pretty high energy. I love the fact that they give you towels, you can buy water, if you are new to spin you have the option to wear sneakers instead of spin shoes, and they have two bathrooms where you can freshen up after class or change. They also have projector screens with the music videos on the wall, which is cool. The quality of the class is solely dependent on the instructor. Take the time to find the right instructor for you. Some of them are really great. \n\nI have a feeling that the owner will pick instructors that pack a full class, but it doesn't mean the instructor is good. Sometimes you have a new instructor that isn't social media savvy or doesn't work at Lululemon for example, and it will obviously take her longer to fill the class and build a reputation. Those instructors do not get the great class times either, and it makes it a lot harder for them to build their class. The problem is the instructors don't really have that long to prove themselves in terms of their marketing ability. \n\nToday, I had a class that was almost full in terms of people who booked the class. The instructor was on her phone texting or e-mailing and figuring out her play list literally the whole class, and it felt like more of a giant advertisement or promotional gig than a class. She kept calling out people in the area that have \"fitness\" businesses or work in the business in the area she kept talking about her future classes, and her eyes were glued to her phone. She also kept changing the song in the middle of the song several times because she didn't have a playlist set up in advance. If someone was not in the business, she would call them out in a rude way for leaving early. It was an hour long class right before most people go to work, so it's likely that some people are going to leave early to get to work in time.  If she knew them, she would say bye with a smile on her face. It was so strange. She also went over on the class, and she didn't have anyone stretch. I personally lose motivation when that happens. I would say that is abnormal though. Go check it out for yourself!",

  "text": "I'm coming up on my one month anniversary of my first true WOD at Crossfit Renaissance so I thought it was time to write a review. I have always been athletic to a degree. I played a lot of sports. I crushed every spin class I took. I ran half marathons for fun. But I get bored easily. Once I truly conquer something, it's no longer interesting to me. I was sick and tired of going to the gym and lifting the same boring kettle bell and doing the same boring bicep curls. I decided to give crossfit a try and came to Crossfit Renaissance after my sister told me how great it was. I literally can walk to about 6 crossfit studios in the city, but I get in my car 5 days a week and drive to CFR. Why? Because the coaches are awesome, the workouts are intense, and the family atmosphere here is like nothing I have experienced before. I didn't want to join a cult. I also didn't want to be shunned because I was the new kid in town. Those \"too cool for you\" vibes don't exist at CFR, and that's why I am so hooked on this place. In just 4 short weeks, I went from having a hard time swinging a 12KG kettlebell to swinging a 20KG kettlebell. I conquered my fear of box jumps (went from 12\" to the real 20\" box) and I completed an unmodified version of Fight Gone Bad. IN MY FIRST MONTH! Coming to CFR is pretty much the best part of my day. I look forward to every single workout, no matter how many burpees are thrown in the mix. My only regret is that I didn't join sooner. If you're looking for a crossfit place, look no further. Get off the couch and come in to CFR. You won't regret it.",

  "text": "TLDR: Amazing prenatal yoga classes, wonderful tribe of moms in the Mommy and Me classes, and now I can add the perfect place to throw a birthday party!\n\nI've been going to Green Locus Yoga for close to two years now. I started when I first got pregnant and now my son is 13 months. Wow, does time fly.\n\nMost recently, we attended a one year old birthday here. It was perfect! Here was the set up.\n\nWe ran in 15 minutes late (of course. Btw how were all the other moms on time? I honestly thought we would all be that late.) The class had already started and kids and moms were dancing on their yoga mats. I really respect places that are timely!\n\nWe had about 30 minutes of yoga/body movement to music (about 45 minutes for everyone who was on time). Then we had some refreshments the mom brought. I thought it was over at this point, but no, we had more structured play with a giant parachute! I thought it was a fantastic way to structure the birthday for one year olds - they have the attention span of squirrels so that food break was a necessity. \n\nAt the end of the party, Mallory, the owner, told everyone to stay as long as we liked, but of course being moms of toddlers, everyone ran for nap time. However, it is a good feeling knowing you are never rushed to leave. \n\nAfter throwing Yoshi's first birthday at my house this year, this seems like the perfect alternative for his next birthday. They have a cap of 12 parents/kids (so a total of about 25), which makes sense for the space. \n\nWe had a blast and the class was perfectly suited for the age of the kids.",

  "text": "When I first reviewed this gym, I said it was okay. I came from 12th St Gym and I really love that gym and would recommend signing up for a membership there if you're anywhere close.  I think City Fitness sucks. So much so that my husband and I decided to buy a treadmill for ourselves for Christmas.\n\nWhen I went to cancel my membership, unfortuantely, although I was told when I started I could cancel any time (I was unsure if I wanted to stay--I was thinking about going back to 12th St, but it was just a wee bit far for my current homestead).\n\nI was told (nicely, the staff is actually quite nice) that I would be charged for the next month.\nAND ALSO: Even though I paid for my last month, this was not counting towards the next month.... sooo I cancelled today (12/18), but I paid through the end of February. \nI can use the gym during that time, but I DO NOT WANT TO.\n\nHere is why:\n\n\n1. While I like the spin classes (again, the staff is nice. I just think the management needs some work), they only have about 15 bikes, so it's tough to get a spot in these classes. I am obsessive and plan my day around exercise so when my idea for my post-work, stress-relief, calorie-burning work-out gets messed up, I am a cranky lady.  You have to call 1.5 hours ahead of the time of the class, but I'm pretty sure the front desk staff takes calls prior to 4:30PM or lets people sign up in person because if you call and get through at 4:31, you're outta luck, you spinhead. It breaks my heart.\n\nALSO: when I joined, I was told it wouldn't be a problem to get into the 6PM classes, but that proved to be fals advertising. I can assume that this gets worse after Jan 1 as well as I was only a member from June-Dec (well, February, GRRRR)\n\n2. The sense of community I had at 12th street seems to be a bit lacking here. \n\n3. The locker room is SO SO SO small. There is one tiny, itty bitty bench and about 50 small lockers. I (used to) ride my bike there from work and my giant bike bag and my coat would make this a very crowded place. Not to mention other gym members!\n\n4. While the gym and the equipment are clean, there are lots of broken equipment or temporarily broken equipment. I didn't usually have to wait during my tenure at City Fitness for a treadmill, but my husband usually had to. (He got there around 615/630. I was coming an hour earlier). I can imagine, though, that you'd have to wait after the New Year as it will get more crowded... Plus, it's a new gym, so more and more people are joining making the place a little more hellish each week.",

As someone who hates running, I was apprehensive about being on a treadmill 50% of the time, but I actually kind of enjoy it!  Here are my highlights: \n\nRunning\n-Woodway treadmills - I'm no aficionado, but I do think they feel a little better to run on - easier on the joints\n-TV screens - 3 options that tell you exactly what speed and incline to use.  I like this so that I don't have to try and listen for the instructor to tell me.  Bonus: it provides a timer so you know exactly how long you need to be crushing it at high speeds.  \n-No one is looking at anyone else, because we're all focused on running through the streets of some CA city\n\nStrength\n-Everyone has their own bench with weights already underneath.  I love this because if I start an exercise and my weights are too heavy or light, it's an easy switch.  I don't have to go to the other side of the room to get additional weights\n-The instructor demos the moves for you, so you can actually see how to do it.  The person at the desk will tell you which spot to go in, and if they see that you are new, they'll put you in a good spot to see the instructor.  \n\nOther\n-They have a few separate shower rooms to get ready in the morning, with what looks like plenty of amenities to get ready in the morning.  The shower rooms are separate from the locker area, so I'm curious to see what mornings are like, if there is a big hold up while people get dressed in the shower rooms before doing hair/makeup in the locker room.  \n-Vibe - I like the club atmosphere and the music, it definitely gets me pumped up to workout.  I also really like that it doesn't feel competitive.  Everyone is focused on their own TV screens and not looking around.  You can push yourself as much as you like.  \n\nOverall, great studio, and I'm looking forward to making it a regular part of my routine!",

We were happy with them previously but they only mandate masks upon entering the facility and more than 50% of the people there were wearing masks. While they do have a couple of sanitizing stations set up and \"suggest\" that people wipe down the equipment before and after using, very few people were doing so. They're also open at 100% capacity. When we spoke to one of the front desk people. they said the health department had been out and gave them the all-clear but I assume it wasn't a surprise inspection and had time to prepare for the visit. I also recall seeing more cleaning staff pre-Covid than I did today. Meanwhile there's 4 people sitting at the front desk doing absolutely nothing. If they're bored, maybe they should go around and wipe down equipment. Much as I'd love to go back, I think I'll either look for a cleaner, safer gym or just keep walking around the park and using free weights at home.

The teacher approached us afterwards and said she felt he would better enjoy the \"Gymnastics\" class at the same date/time instead.  It was an easy switch for us and our son couldn't be happier in his new class.  It was great to see the staff want to make sure the kids are challenged but still having fun.\n\nA word on flexibility (double meaning alert!)... The teacher for our youngest son's class has been very easy to work with because of his limb difference (no fingers on his right hand).  She meets his needs without making him feel different or limited... which we TRULY appreciate.\n\nI would recommend Fusion to anyone!",

  "text": "I used to workout here about ten years ago and went back a few years ago. It really isn't the worst gym I've been to, but they are way too sales oriented. Also, their contracts always have a bunch of random fees and other nonsense that can catch you off guard if you don't pay attention.  \n\nThey still call me multiple times per year to get me to come back, and I find this very annoying. If I want to come back, I will give you a call. \n\nCleaning in the main areas happens regularly, but I once saw a water bottle sit on the same machine for two weeks in the womens' room without moving. That was a little disturbing. For those of you who think I care too much about cleanliness, go look at some pictures of staph online, and get back to me with your feelings on gym cleanliness.\n\nI probably would have kept going if it hadn't had been for a sales rep named Amanda who got incredibly hostile when I told her that I didn't want to talk about renewing my contract yet because I was considering going to Planet Fitness. Otherwise, the rest of the staff were actually really nice.",

I make it a point to come here around 3 or 4 days a week and I've definitely gotten my money's worth.\n\nI've heard people critique Planet Fitness quite a bit and I can understand why this chain isn't for everyone.  They don't allow deadlifting and if you want yoga/body pump/Pilates classes you're going to have to look towards somewhere like the Y.   Planet Fitness definitely has the feel of being geared towards newcomers at the gym, which makes it perfect for someone like me, who's a little shy in the gym.

This studio doesn't have the bells and whistles of some of the larger, national studios that have rolled into town, but it does come with a more affordable price tag, which I can get behind. \n\nThere is definitely a quality over quantity vibe to Body Cycle that I dig. Instructors know names, and they really keep an eye out for form, reminding the class at times not to hunch shoulders, keep butts back, etc. Those little cues are great reminders for me personally, since I have a tendency to tense up. Also, I love the bikes. They are very smooth to ride and easy to tweak as instructors call out cues to adjust the resistance. \n\nI've taken classes with Jessica, Shoshana and Jenna and I love all three instructors. I've also never had a problem getting into a class time I want, though generally I go for more random times like weekday lunch and 4:30pm. The front desk staff is always friendly, and I do believe they have the softest towels in all the land.\n\nMy five class package has been completed and I tend to take my cardio outdoors during summer, but I look forward to taking more classes at Body Cycle sometime in the future.",

It's intimidating going to a new studio, however, the ladies here were so welcoming. The front desk gave me a warm welcome when I said it was my first class. They showed me around and made me feel right at home. Not to mention, they wrote a little welcome on the locker for me.

The music really wasn't my vibe, but I still enjoyed the class and got a great workout.  I would be curious to try the other instructors and find the one I like best.\n\nThere are plenty of bathrooms and showers, they provide shoes, and towels. The amenities are A+ and like I said the staff was awesome! Also your first class is FREE! So there's no reason to not try it.\n\nI think I'm going to buy the 4 classes per month membership to supplement my OTF classes!!! The class packs are affordable.

They offer a free tour but its basically an overview of the space. There are 'pocket' rooms for stretching and specific step by step processes for those machines to get a 30 min workout for example. \nI hate gyms but at $22/month (including tax) and an eating habit of a true New Orleanian foodie, I I have no choice but to join. For $22 a month you can bring a guest every visit so its basically a membership for my daughter and I. The only downside is only the member can use the extra amenities like the massage chairs.   They do advertise to the average person, not the competitive gym junkie so hopefully I will fit right in. (the gym and my pants)",

I have been going for 18 months and have dropped my bodyfat from 29.9% to 13.8%.  From Pilates, to yoga, to personal training, I have enjoyed every bit of my time there.  Yes it is not your normal Tampa gym, but the service, the staff and all the amenities are fantastic when compared to the other gyms I have been to in Tampa.  I have made it my daily destination for myself and it has paid off greatly.  I love working out there as the bathrooms are clean, the gym doesn't smell and the equipment is taken care of in spades compared to the other two gyms I visit in town.  I will admit, this gym is not for everyone, but it is amazing for me.",

I've never had any trouble or wait for the equipment of my choice, no matter the time of day. There's a plethora of cardio equipment (treadmill, elliptical, and cycles). Every visit always shows me that no matter the crowd size there's always available equipment. There's also hydro massage, tanning beds, and massage beds and chairs. I wish there were a sauna but there isn't. Also the locker room has 4 showers and 2 changing booths for changing clothes in privacy. The showers take a moment for the water to warm up and also the water pressure fluctuates whenever someone flushes the toilet. There's a cooler with drinks for sale, in case you forget yours at home. There's an area specifically made for ab workouts. The area has machines that focus on core and there's also directions on the wall on how to use the area. There's also a 30 minute workout area that allows you to fully workout your body in a timely manner, equipped with a traffic light that'll let you know when to switch machines. The staff here are pretty laid back but are available if you need any assistance.",

  "text": "Yet another Anytime Fitness has opened in the Tampa Bay area. There is no way that any other fitness-related company can come close to having the number of locations that they have around here. I love that no matter where I am I know that I'm not going to be far from an Anytime Fitness. And when I go on vacation there is a great chance that one will be available and I won't have to pay any guest fees to use the gym. This location is brand new and all of the equipment inside of it is as well. Walking up to it I actually thought that it was going to be pretty small. It's crammed into a corner between a Citi Financial and a Firehouse Subs.   I was actually surprised when I saw the free-weight  area because it is bigger than I expected. They've got two power racks and a smith machine.  The power racks are a good distance apart but connected by bars that you can do suspension training from.  In the opposite corner there's a full TRX setup.  There's a good number of plate loaded machines (my favorite). I didn't see a room for classes like some locations have but that's not something that I make use of anyway.  As for cardio they've got five treadmills, four ellipticals, a stair master, and a couple of bikes. This is a location I'll definitely want to come back to.",

  "text": "I cancelled this membership in July. Usually, I get text notifications whenever a transaction occurs on my card, but for some sneaky reason, they kept deducting me, some times more than once a month. I didn't realize it until MAY that I was always $20-40 short. I called and demanded my membership be cancelled-BECAUSE I HADN'T EVEN BEEN IN SINCE JULY-and they said I would have to come in to talk to a manager, who just so happened to have a very limited schedule that didn't work for me. I asked why they couldn't just cancel or have the manager call me to cancel, but they said I had to come in. Half the reason I needed to cancel is cuz I moved to the other side of town and didn't want to drive 30 minutes+ to go to the gym. So, I finally had to take time off (which is so ridiculous), and I brought my boyfriend in with me to cancel. They easily owe me hundreds of dollars and refused to refund me. \nI've heard online about these issues with cancelling @ Planet fitness before, but didn't realize it would be so ridiculous.\nThe other reason I cancelled is because the staff kept coming around bumping in to me/the machine I was using when they were cleaning, engaging in discussions that were really inappropriate, and generally making me feel uncomfortable. \nI've joked a lot that this was like the worst break up I ever went through, and PF is like the crazy ex boyfriend who keeps calling you (and deducting money from you for months).\nNOT COOL.",

  "text": "BEWARE of hidden fees!!!  Some of my friends go to this gym, so I thought I would give it a shot.  Now, after I've been a member for a few month, I regret that decision.  My main reasons for complete dis-satisfaction are:  \n\n1)  HIDDEN FEES - There are hidden fees when you sign up, hidden fees when you cancel (I feel like there are hidden fees if I sweat too much!...)  \n\n2) HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT - This gym is run like a widget factory instead of a service provider.  When you speak to management about concerns, suggestions, or just saying hello, it is evident that they do not really care for their members.  Also, when I emailed them, or left a comment on the web-page, I received no response at all!  They are here to make money (which, I get it, we all are...), but at the end of the day, they are a service provider. They should be making money by providing a valued service, and somehow the satisfaction of their membership is just not a priority here.  Crazy.   \n\n3)  POOR CLASS SCHEDULE - The class schedule (spin, especially) is not convenient for any working professional. There are very few classes that start after 6, so if you work anything but a strict 9-5, good luck finding more than one class you can attend.  And some of the instructors are mediocre, so when you can make it to a class, you may not get a good workout... \n\n4)  TIRED EQUIPMENT - I take spin the most, and there a few bikes that are always wobbly.  There is one bike whose handlebars do not raise up.  There are a few bikes that the shoe straps are broken...  (week after week after month...come on guys, fix 'em already!) \n\n\nYelp friends, I write this a cautionary tale.  Please learn from my mistakes, and  please make an informed decision before you join here...",

They offer a wide array of group classes with fun instructors, to which none of the classes are ever 100% full, which I love because I get my own space and don't feel \"stared at.\"  The cardio area is large with a nice selection of equipment; I've never had to wait on a machine either, which is a huge plus for me.  I'm not one to really socialize while working out unless I specifically come with someone to workout with... that said, on the floor, everyone really respects the space of those around them but doesn't make the environment feel cold or unwelcoming.\n\nI absolutely love how on Monday evenings and Saturday mornings a local farmers market sets up in the lobby with luscious greens, farm fresh eggs and fresh seasonal fruit/veggies.  Talk about encouragement and a friendly reminder to be healthy from within, too!  They also have a health-conscious chef delivering homemade soups, fresh juices and other meals in their cafe to take with you (which comes in handy those nights I'm working out late or I'm on the go with no time to cook.)  I have to give them huge props in this area on standing out as their own entity in the vicinity.\n\nOverall, the environment is great, the facility is clean and I would highly recommend this gym over any other one in our area.  My only suggestion to the club would be for the child care: to segregate the children by age groups (i.e. separating the older children from the younger toddlers/babies.)  Oh, and let me add... the pool is salt water :)",

  "text": "The main reason I go to this gym is because it's open 24 hours. That's it. \n\nThe employees are all friendly, but I would never ask them for any work out advice. Some (if not most) just seem like they're front desk receptionists. I know they have some personal trainers, but I don't know if I trust them either. They usually just carry around a clip board marking tallies on a paper. I feel as if their programs aren't specialized for that person, which is not what I would want from a program/trainer. But I would never know because these personalized training sessions are crazy expensive! They're multiple sessions for hundreds of dollars. On top of that, day employees usually just talk to each other/other people. They don't really greet people or even sit at the front counter. Night employees are better. They're usually reading a book (which is fine with me), but they're always at the front desk greeting and saying goodbye to every person that enters/leaves the gym.\n\nThe facility has a certain musk to it, and that's not good. It's like there is barely any circulation/ventilation in the whole gym. The lockers in the bathroom are flimsy, with some lockers broken. There is a sauna and a steam room, so that's a plus. And the workout studio upstairs is better kept than the rest of the gym. Lights are bright, equipment is cleaner and there are large fans. \n\nThe equipment is all really old and outdated. Dumbbells look and feel like they haven't been cleaned or sanitized in forever. There are only THREE squat racks. And that's a problem if you come during busier times (5-8pm). Free weights/plates are usually just lying around. I mean that's poor gym etiquette for the people going, but employees should at least make an attempt to re-rack weights that have been lying on the floor for over 2 hours. Other than that, the machines work except for some of the cardio equipment upstairs. I feel as if the cardio equipment has been \"temporarily out of service\" for months now. \n\nOverall, I pay way too much to go to this gym. It's $30 a month. Upside though is that I can go to any 24 hour fitness. Just go to the one in South Reno.",

Two weeks after signing up, an email went out to all the members notifying us of the price increase: $2/month. So we'll be paying $24 more a year in addition to the $105/month we already pay? This is ridiculous to me. I've lived in bigger cities, more expensive cities than Philly, and I've never heard of a price hike like this. I was willing to pay the high price because I thought the Sporting Club was worth it. \n\nI haven't been impressed with the classes. Yoga in particular was a disappointment.  People really take themselves very seriously in these classes, especially the older folks who glared at me for unknown reasons. Doesn't make for a welcoming or comfortable experience. My back is still sore, a week later, from 1 yoga class. And not in a good way. Some of the other reviewers mentioned the older people who enjoy prancing around the locker rooms fully naked. I didn't think that would bother me. But there's a lot of that. Plus, it seems kind of odd to sit in the whirlpool naked. The whirlpool is probably my favorite feature of the entire gym. \n\nThis is also the only gym I checked out that didn't offer a free pass of any type. No try before you buy? That might have helped with my initial decision.",

The manager was nice at the start And then became rude because I went to a bar used the weight that was already on it, someone told me that they were going to use it and didn't and the manager pinned me for it. Terrible staff and member are judgmental as well.",

Paper towels and hand sanitizer just doesn't seem adequate and I rarely see anyone doing it anyway. \nI do like all the machine options and that they give you a towel (works better than paper towels to clean the machines). I've enjoyed all the classes so far, but I wish there were some between and 10 and 4. \nI don't get hassled by the club to purchase personal training, but I do get bothered occasionally by random people walking around. \nAll in all, pretty decent and probably better than the rest around.",

I use to do 5-6 days a week for at least an hour each and got to the point where I was struggling to workout once a week.  I joined in order to get a little off the waist and strengthen my legs for a ski trip (first in 5 years).   Even going only 1-2 times e-fit a week I've lost an inch off my waist, gained muscle AND after only 6 sessions was able to ski 4 days straight on all black diamonds.  I've never been able to do that!   Best part is I'm in, done, showered and off to work in under an hour!  It feels like cheating except my muscles are more exhausted than they have ever been after my old workouts.  And its the whole body.  Ive done Crossfit and liked that, but always got injured.  Here there is no injury risk cause its low impact.  Feels like sports training in high-school or something all over again.

It's not posh, but it does have some luxuries (sauna, juice bar, individual flat screens at each piece of cardio), and has all the equipment that you'll ever need to get a great workout whether you are a beginner or a serious lifter/fitness buff. \n\nSaying this, I am familiar with a gym, and mostly use free weights and some cardio equip. So, I can't comment on their classes or training. I have no idea about either of those. However, the front desk always seems friendly when I come in, and the locker rooms are always clean...which is really important, and I imagine, hard to keep up with. The equipment is also very well maintained - anything I've seen broken is fixed quickly, and things are taken care of. The owner clearly keeps up on the club.\n\nI've looked at other gyms in the area, and none of them compare. If you are serious about getting into shape, this is the place to go. It's convenient, and it's priced fairly. \n\nOne of the things I like best about being there, is that everyone who comes seems pretty serious about taking care of themselves, and you'll see people at all stages in their fitness regimes - from just beginning to more advanced...all working hard.

Prior to starting the class I couldn't touch my toes and by the end I was able to touch them without bending my knees.  I also had a full body workout that was great cardio as well.  Let's just say if I had to choose between running a couple miles or taking her class it would be this class hands down!  Not only was the music a nice addition but the atmosphere was amazing.  She was able to teach while performing so that a ballet novice, like myself, would be able to do the simple moves and do them properly.  \n\nEven if you are a guy I highly recommend going.

  "text": "I went into LA fitness looking for an alternative to PSC.  I informed the rep that I had already paid through the next month at PSC, but wanted to see what the facility looked like and that I may sign up after my current membership expires.  I was given a tour and then asked for a free 1 or 2 day pass so that I could come and actually use a treadmill and maybe check out a gym class.  He asked his manager, who was faced in the opposite direction and apparently too busy listening to his music on his headphones to turn around and speak to me directly, who said that I'd have to sign up for an annual contract for that.  I explained that I wasn't going to sign up for something that I haven't tried yet.  The rep eventually did give me a free week's pass since it was on the back of his fill-in-the-name business card, so I sat down with him and discussed opening an account, starting the day that my current membership at PSC would expire.  He said in order to lock in the same pricing, he'd need my name, credit card info, and the date of activation.  He guaranteed me that he'd call me a week before so that I could authorize payment.\n\nNot only was I badgered 2 hours later by both the rep and his manager who said I'd need sign up that day to lock in the deal, but my credit card was then processed for a full annual payment the next week.  After several calls and reassurances that this was done in error were made by both the rep and the manager, I checked my credit card balance and the payment had still not been credited back.  When I called again, I was told that there seemed to be a disagreement about the terms of the sign up and wouldn't you know it, there was no manager with authority there that could cancel my membership. I was transferred to a manager at another location, who also told me they didn't have the authority to cancel my membership that I never authorized payment for.  \n\nNeedless to say, the whole episode was strikingly similar to the idiot Comcast service rep who wouldn't let a caller disconnect, giving LA fitness the trophy for worst customer service and management.  \n\nNot only was it unprofessional, it was really skeevy and gross.\n\n\nDon't sign up for LA fitness ever, especially not this location.  \n\nAlso, this gym smells.",

One of the first things I research when I am out of town, besides a good trail to hike, is a quality gym that's equipped with free weights, a power rack, and a lot of dumbbells.  This gym has it all including a ton of cardio equipment.  A day pass is only $10 per day and worth it to me, especially if I'm having a two-a-day.  The gym goers here are also respectable.  They clean/disinfect the equipment after they're done, they re-rack their weights, they wear their mask the whole time, and most importantly, they workout hard.  The atmosphere at this gym is awesome. \n\nCouple of tips...\n\n1).  People either break or \"five finger discount\" the safety clamps.  You can borrow a set at the front desk or do what I do.  I bring my own.  Safety First!\n\n2).  Lockers are still out of order due to Covid-19\n\n3).  This gym is located at the mall next door to Dick's Sporting Goods. \n\n4).

  "text": "If you are (finally) serious about getting in shape, then row zone is the place for you. It was a Living Social coupon that brought me here, and I had no idea what to expect. So let me fill you in on what to expect. \n\nEach session is a near constant 45 minute work out. It alternates between x amount of time on a rowing machine and exercises that you stand up and do next to your machine. So you might row for 300 meters, then get off of the machine and do 10-20 reps of squats, an abdominal exercise (some type of plank or sit up), or light weights. Then you do it again. \n\nIt is not a gym. There are free lockers. There are also two bathrooms if you need to change before and after the exercise. There are about 20 rowing machines, so that that is the max size of each class. Classes are offered in the early morning (usually 6 am, 7 am), noon, and in the evening (5:30 pm, 6:30 pm, 7:30 pm). and in the mornings on weekends. There are several instructors. They are VERY supportive. None of them mess around -- you are getting a 45 minute workout. No two classes are exactly the same because they are always changing the combinations and lengths of exercises. \n\nYou can pay by the class or get them as a package. For example, I signed up for \"six weeks to awesomeness\", which is any session for a total of 3 per week (so now I'm officially awesome). There is also an unlimited where you can go once per day as many days per week as you want for a month. \n\nIf you haven't done this before, then I would just start by buying a few classes or look for the the coupon on Living Social. If you like it, then I would jump in. If you really want results, then I would ultimately get the unlimited and then straight line depreciate that by going as often as you can, if not every day. Unless you are stopping off at the Shake Shack on your way home, you will see yourself get in better shape. It's sort of like having a trainer. You could do this at the gym, but you really need to know what you are doing, and most people don't know what they are doing.",

When it was owned by Wendy Black this was a fun place to work out, and everyone that work here knew every member by name and they would greet you and were always up for conversation. Now the staff just stares at you, no greeting, no welcome, no good bye have a nice day, nothing. Very stand standoffish now, except for a young lady that work Sundays. She always has a smile for everyone. The music they play continues to be too loud and the most annoying music I have ever heard. If you wear your own ear buds, you can't enjoy your own music for the loud back ground noise. The equipment is pretty antiquated compared to a place like 24hr Fitness or other large gyms. A change in staff and new equipment would greatly improve the atmosphere. If you have difficultly going up and down stairs there is no elevator to get to the basement workout room and locker rooms! Seems like that would be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. There are definitely nicer gyms around town.",

I will update this post when and if the a/c is fixed, and probably up the rating from the current two stars.  The new management made no attempt to solicit the opinions of its customers when changing classes, and seems to be just cost cutting in many ways.  \n\nIt is possible to get a treadmill even during the usual rush hours, probably due to people leaving the gym.  So good news and bad news.  The instructors who chose to stay are are quality folks, so another plus.\n\nOh, and the email address one has to search the web for since the lafitness website seems to only offer a customer service phone number?  When I tried to email info@lafitness.com here was the result:\n\n\"Sorry, we were unable to deliver your message to the following address.\n\ninfo@lafitness.com:\nRemote host said: 550 #5.1.0 Address rejected info@lafitness.com [RCPT_TO]\"\n\nMost professional corporations seek out feedback at the corporate level about their individual locations.  925-255-7200 is their corporate main line, and their website directs one the   813-775-6492 for the \"customer service phone number in your area\" which hopefully is not the same set of managers who does not seem to be listening to their customers.\n\n***UPDATE: They fixed the A/C upstairs about a week ago (around 1/7/2013)!  Thanks L.A. Fitness and Yelp!  I added a star to my review.  Good place for Yoga, more here than at the Dale Mabry location.",

If a patron, usually male, is throwing weights aggressively (i.e. almost hitting others) or disturbing other customers the staff WILL address it, which did not happen before. I will say that a large number of teenagers here are creepy: they are misusing equipment, loud, interrupt other's workouts, and just watch others in the gym very intensely. \n\nHowever, male personal trainers are the most frustrating. They are constantly asking members to move out of their way (even when just walking around the gym), get off machines, and/or stop THEIR workouts to make room for the trainer. If someone is using a machine, you can't make them move. It's in the member terms and conditions. Female trainers don't cause this issue, but male trainers do.",

Boredom kills my motivation. But getting to try something new almost every class has been both exciting and rewarding. \n\nPrior to signing up, I read a lot about the \"Crossfit koolaid\"... I even got warnings from friends who knew people who got 'sucked in.'  In my experience, it has not been all-consuming. In fact, it's been a really great outlet for making new friends, setting goals, and conquering challenges. \n\nNaptown gets a gold star for their intentional community. They really set up a collaborative environment for everyone (even well-fed curvy girls who can't lift their body-weight to save their lives). :) Gyms can be intimidating, but in my experience, I've been challenged and supported every step of the way. I rowed 5,000 meters on a Saturday morning at one session. Who does that?! It was a lot of fun!!!\n\nThey have a free beginners class on Thursday evening which everyone should try at least once. It's a great workout and everything is tailored to your specific needs. I was a ball of nerves in my first class... but when it turned out okay, I felt really good about myself and the new friends I had made. Chat with the owners, I even tried out a few regular classes before I started (paid for) my month-membership. There are coaches in every class who come around and help you do your best work.\n\nBonus Feature: I got super-sick in the middle of my first month membership and Naptown was kind enough to suspend my membership for the week I was out and extend it by one week.

It's definitely worth it if you put in the time and deduction..I'm down several inches all over my body as the program uses measurements as well as the scale to track weight loss.\n\nMy current trainer is Kerwin West. When I first met Kerwin he asked me what my weight loss goals.. I said I wanted to look like Serena Williams (a girl can dream right?) and he said ok. At my next workout.. Boy did I get what I asked for! :-)I felt like all the trainers trainers there are good, but I come to appreciate Kerwin's attentiveness to your work out. I feel like he does a great job at putting together a string workout! I can't wait to see the result obtained by working with him!\n\nIf your considering the program.. DO IT! Its so worth it..

  "text": "This YMCA was the one that first caught my eye to join the family of gyms.  The facility is architecturally amazing.  Inside, the gym is state-of-the art and clean as a pin.\n\nIt's a bit prison-yard during the day with the big guys slamming down the weights, not racking their weights when they are done and a lot of loud testosterone yells when they lift.  \n\nBest visit time is late at night.  Between 8:30 a.m. and noon is a nightmare!",

  "text": "Two things upfront: Life Time can feel like a constant up sell at times and I don't plan on reviewing their cancellation policy (cancelling any subscription service is a nightmare).\n\nWe had some billing issues initially (since they hadn't opened), but our account manager corrected the charges and made good for the inconvenience. Once it opened, there were more growing pains as with any new business. I say all this simply because no experience is perfect.\n\nSo why 5 stars? I look at the gym as an investment rather than an expense. It's clear to me that a good portion of the staff takes the same approach. The facility isn't even a year old and they've just upgraded two of the workout studios. They are very open to feedback and take action on a fair amount.\n\nJim E. (Bootcamp Jim) takes it to another level.  I've never met someone who takes a more personal interest in his customers. He's constantly incorporating new equipment and challenges into our classes. I'm not alone in seeing a real transformation since joining.",

  "text": "UPDATE: It's been cleaned up. Lotsa stuff for disinfecting. Social distancing enforces and masks are required 100% of the time. \n\n2018: The Gym has been remodeled, cleaned up and opened up on June 18th. It looks good on the surface, but there's a lot of loose ends to clean up like holes in the wall and dirt from all the construction. I am saddened that they got rid of some of the newer machines for bench pressing. Now there are fewer options for some of the muscle groups. What is more, they kept the old Precor ellipticals, but not the older (but newer than the Precor) Matrix elliptical. The new Matrix ones have a higher step in the revolution that hurts my knees. Still the newer ones have TVs. I'm noticing more young people on them. \n\nAlso, there is LESS water Fountians and cleaning dispensers. This means planning your walks over to the stations. \n\nSTILL Overall, the BIGGEST letdown for me was that the new dumbbells go up only in 5lb. increments, instead of the 2.5lb. increments like the Marana and Oro Valley clubs. I was really looking forward to that. But sad to say it did not happen. Still it is new with a newer feel. New floors, some new furniture, new resurfaced pool, new enlarged cycle classroom and several new (4) machines called \"Hoist\". These are the coolest upgrade for me. The Hoist machines rock entirely while doing a crunch, a bicep curl, the shoulder press or the back exercise. \n\nTry it for yourself if you are so inclined. You may find the new matrix machines are fitting for you. Maybe 5lb. increments are quite doable. You won't know till you try. I'm still going to show up, cause this location works great for me.",

  "text": "5 stars, across the board! This is the cleanest facility I've ever been to. The staff is absolutely amazing. Ryan provides an excellent on boarding experience and all of the additional support staff provide exceptional customer service. Each locker room has its own attendant, so all of the amenities are fully stocked, and the locker room doesn't smell like a locker room. Breana at the front desk always recognizes the regulars by name which truly makes it feel like home. The equipment is top notch and due to the clubs exclusivity and limited memberships, never at capacity, which means never waiting for equipment. They have a diverse array of free and additional cost classes for every taste (Yoga, Pilates, Cycling, Barre, as well as strength and conditioning). The locker rooms are equipped with steam room, sauna and jacuzzi, as well as towel service (optional laundry service as well). It's truly a classy experience and the perfect place for professionals who do not like the \"bro\" atmosphere of an LA fitness or CRUNCH. In my experience, the members have been respectful and diverse. It's definitely a premium price, but well worth the money.",

  "text": "I came to the gym for a Yelp event. Last time I had a gym membership was in 2006 in Las Vegas. Between my lack of dedication, exercise induced asthma and osteoarthritis, it has been a long time since I thought working out was a good idea. \n\nAs with all events, we were introduced to the staff which were warm and welcoming as were the owners. The coaches, Kelly, Leslie and Shelace were also friendly and well trained. We learned of their credentials, which were not only impressive but it was nice to hear that they are actually trained in their specialty and not just someone who learned how to be a fitness coach via YouTube. \n\nOne of the aspects that I found was impressive was that they emphasized to go at your own pace. My pace is very slow and my jog resembles speed walking. But I didn't feel pressured to keep up with the group and wasn't given an evil eye when I took a break or two. \n\nThis gym also teaches self defense classes which I will probably be attending in the near future. While this gym has jujitsu classes, their emphasis is fitness. So if you are looking to fight in the octagon in the near future, this gym isn't for you. \n\nAll in all this is definitely not your average gym. If you want to try it out, on their website they offer a free day pass that is worth trying.",

It's doesn't get too crowded, except in the Am 8-9 am and after work (5-7 pm). Overall, I usually never have to wait for a machine. They have an adequate amount of cardio machines and offer some group fitness classes for an additional fee. All the members are nice, I've only encountered a few \"gym douches\" over the years of going here.

  "text": "I am a newer member of this gym and I truly could not speak more highly of it! The last gym I went to left such a bad taste in my mouth that I was not sure that I even wanted to sign up for a new gym membership and perhaps just try exercising in the great outdoors. Three months later and 0 workouts in the beautiful outdoors I knew I needed to sign up for a gym membership, and stat. Sometime in 2014 I did a tour of South Rac and although I had fallen in love, I felt the price was too much for me at the time, and moved on.\nMy boyfriend was very persistent we looked into South Rac again a few years later, and I still brushed him off about the finances of it all. Well, he wore me down and thank goodness he did. They have a great deal for couples (as long as you have the same address, I believe) and they waived the initiation fee as apart of a holiday deal. I am so glad I re-visted this gym as I am back on my workout plan and feel as good as I ever have! This gym is clean, like really clean. The members here take pride in that, and always clean the benches they are on after use, which does not happen at gyms often. The members here also always re-rack their weights which is such a nice change of pace from my last gym. The front desk staff is always really nice too, and will learn your name the more you come! The classes look really fun, I just haven't gotten to try one yet. I love being a member at South Rac and I have no intention of ever leaving this gym!",

  "text": "My home Planet Fitness is in Roxborough which in fairness is a brand new facility in comparison.  I also have been going to the one in Phoenixville on occasion. My two cents: make the trip to one of these locations before going to the Pottstown location. \n\nIn short, the Pottstown location is a disappointment.  The equipment has been used and abused and seems to be in desperate need of a makeover.  Not all of the equipment of course, but the equipment that is most commonly used.  My treadmill sounded like a three-wheeled shopping cart.  Some of the workout benches I used had rips in them.  The only thing more annoying was the lunk alarm.  Overall, after frequenting the other two PF locations, this one is like a flip phone compared to a smartphone.\n\nLet me preface this next comment with this: I by no means come off as a \"gym rat\" or a \"lunk\" as PF like to say.  I am 5'11\", 170lbs and your pretty average run of the mill guy. It doesn't matter what I look like, point of the matter is I am a respectful gym-goer and also disapprove of intimidating gym behavior you may see in other gyms.   I \"get\" the lunk alarm and what it represents but what I don't get is how prematurely pushing the \"lunk alarm\" to warn of disapproved behavior does not make people in the gym feel even more uncomfortable and awkward.  I was in the free weight section and had a dumbbell standing tall on its side.  I went to shift it and fell to its side creating a mild thump.  And when I say mild, I mean mild.  A 25lb weight falling on its side from a floor position accidentally did not justify creating an even bigger scene by pushing the lunk alarm.  I almost would have been embarrassed except I was so obviously not demonstrating inappropriate behavior that I didn't care, nor did I think anyone thought it was from me.  Quite simply, the noise should have been perhaps noted and observed, but it was clearly an accident (a mild one at that) and not a representation of intimidating behavior.  If it repeated again and again...that is another story.  Now, instead of having a member utilize that location out of convenience, PF Pottstown is now getting a bad review and one less person going there.  \n\nSo from the equipment that is ripped up and worn out to that experience in within 45 minutes of my first visit, I will drive the extra twenty minutes to go to the much better Phoenixville location when I am in this area.",

  "text": "I give this club a three star, only because of the staff at the front entrance, otherwise the club is clean, trainers seem to like what they do, and it's in a great location.  That being said, here we go.  I went in on a Saturday to see about signing up for a membership, I was directed to nice gentleman with dark tone skin, can't remember his name, but he was very nice.  A after the tour, I explained I needed to wait till Monday to get a discount voucher from work, no problem.  After some casual talk, on my way out I asked if I could get a pass till I was able to bring in the voucher, he quickly dismissed the idea by asking me to bring in the voucher.  I have a friend who also goes to LA Fitness, I told him I was going to join, and he goes to the Golf-links location, too far for me.  That same night I get a call from the Golf-links Club, nice guy named Andrew, he offered me a pass, and said that a friend had requested it for me, I later learned it was indeed my friend.  I decided to go and join at the Golf-links Location, since they were so nice, and the front desk people very professional, its called reciprocating.  after coming back to my location, Oro Valley, I was approached by a very nice trainer Mike, who offered an hour free training, this turned out to be on the day I went to Golf-links to sign up so I called at 5:30 AM to cancel with Mike, off offcourse when I went in today Mike had not gotten the message , we rescheduled and was told that that's the norm with the front desk.  That same morning I approached the front desk to ask about a promotional package that they had promised to give me, a towel , lanyard and a T-shirt, well they never took care of that either.  I came out after my workout and inquired about both my message to cancel from the day before and my stuff.  The young lady in charge at the front was very busy with personal chit-chat, smiling and conversing , from what I could here it was not business related.  After getting her attention, I asked about these things, she acted bothered and not very helpful, she said that that was someone else I had to speak with and they were not at their station, I had to ask if they were going to be in any time soon, she said I think about 11:00, she should have told me that from the start.  I then told her about Mike, and why he was not given the message on cancellation, she basically said , well I didn't take message, not very good people skills.  I asked if I could speak to Mike, since he had offered to give me his phone, she said I think he left.  After walking around the corner I saw Mike on the floor training someone else, oh, she didn't seem to know who mike was either, had to describe him.  This staff at the front along with the very uninformed manager should be fired.  I don't know who hires and qualifies for LA Fitness, but they need to follow up on their staff.  This is the worst I have seen in a while, and only in two days of dealing with this location and staff.",

They have a racquetball court, an indoor track, sponsor a lot of fun local fitness events for members, etc.  \n\nParking during peak times is still an issue. People park in fire lanes out of desperation.\n\nPlease don't park in the lots across the street either, it is difficult to see in the dark but they have unauthorized parking will be towed 24 hours signs.  The small building near the main southrac has a lot last time I checked that doesn't have a sign BUT there is no painted crosswalk, it is on a curve, and is not well lit with cars going 40 around the curve. I used to park there all the time until I was almost hit by car.\n\nI love this gym but hate the parking issue. My schedule now allows me to visit them at non peak hours so I'm pretty happy but that could change in the next few weeks. If you can only visit the gym during peak times (after work ), prepare for parking issues. Otherwise, this is a pretty great gym if you can make it any other time.",

I took an intro 15 minute class to learn how to set up the bike and the different positions, it was helpful and motivating enough for me to come back. \n\nThe first class was hard, the next 10 were still hard, and then I signed up for the Love Yourself Challenge. I went pretty often and had a great experience. This class is still hard but I've learned to love it and I typically burn at least 450 calories per session, so I can't complain. Happy to have this next to my apartment!",

  "text": "I've had some funny/gross experiences at the Center of Clayton. Mostly, the gross and funny come from the women's locker room. People do not understand that I do not want to see someone's old wrinkly naked body change in front of me. Nor do I want to see a bunch of kids change in front of me either. One time some lady brought in her three kids, two girls and a boy, to change in the women's locker room and they were totally crowding my space. Of all the aisle to choose she chose the one where there was someone already changing. Thanks... One of the little girl's  behind was daringly close to me. The mother didn't even bat an eyelash and didn't care that I was clearly not happy about the situation. Where are your manners? Seriously! I suspect that the little girl farted in my face as well. But, that mystery remains unsolved to this day.\n\nWhat's even funnier is when I see kids and adults walk around the locker room barefoot to go to the bathroom or the shower. That's gross. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know you should probably put some sandals on so you don't catch some disease on your feet. Actually, I kinda hope they do get warts or something so that I can say I told you so!\n\n\nDespite all the funny and the gross, this place is great if you're looking for some decent exercise equipment to use, some casual rock climbing/swimming and perhaps some basketball playing.  For those mentioned it's totally worth the price to be a member. I haven't tried any of the fitness classes, but I do see people working up a sweat.  I'm a little annoyed that you have to pay per class, and that's why I have boycotted them for now. \n\nRecently there have been a few important machines that have been broken and have been broken for at least a month, but I've been able to satiate my workout needs by mixing it up and using something different.  Overall, the place lacks in the quality of some of its members, but for those that have manners, the place is pretty cheap for residents and definitely on my way from work, which is a plus!",

I usually do the spin class here with Steve and tonight the cleat on my spin shoe got stuck in the spin bike sooo I spoke to the instructor and my fellow riders who informed me that this had occurred every now and than and I just need to ask the front desk to remove the cleat and than I can have my shoe repaired . Well when I went to speak to the front desk staff .The guy actually said \" so what do you want ME to do ?\" I told him I wanted to know if he could retrieve the cleat . He looked puzzled and annoyed and than told me that he didn't know how to get it out . That I should have asked the instructor . Which btw I did but the instructor teaches the class he isn't the maintenance guy . Anywho this guy tried helping me out by using his key .While doing so I asked if they didn't have any specific tools to get it out  because using a key was ridiculous . At which he replied \" look I'm trying to help you out .\"This job will not make or break me .\"like wth ? NO one was of help all three fools did not know what to do so I had to leave without my cleat . Bad enough I pay you guys monthly and have to wait an hour and a half to sign up for spin class but than you patronize me and cost me more money by not removing the cleat . GHETTO GHETTO GHETTO . This same dude was the same dude begging me to tell my friends and family to join when I entered . Puh! I'm telling friends and family all about this and how shitty their staff is . NOW the ONLY reason I continue to go here is because I love spinning with Steve . He is a great instructor . As for the help and customer service in this place they can all disappear. They're  the reason why this country has to put directions on shampoo . Smh ! Shame on you la fitness for not having higher standards when hiring front desk staff for your gyms.",

I never thought I'd actually look forward to going to the gym, but with such a convenient location and such great facilities and classes, I went almost every day that month. I even asked them to extend my month by two days when Sandy made me lose 2 days. That being said I just can't justify it with a student budget right now (although they do offer student discounts and they're running a Thankgiving special if you sign up in the next few days you get a few month or massage or something) \n\nFacilities: \nClean, nice, towels everywhere in every shape, free razors in the bathrooms (its the little things...) sauna, whirlpool, steam room, pool, 3 floors, track, every machine ever, personal trainers, TRX room, Pilates room, boxing rings/bags, squash/racketball courts, basketball courts, yoga studio, cafe, massage rooms, tanning area...they have EVERYTHING. sometimes I just hung out in the sauna and whirlpool for 2 hours after my workout.\n\nStaff is hit or miss. They could have been friendlier. We asked for a tour and the guy seemed annoyed to give us one.( --1/2 star)\n\nCLASSES: \nI like taking classes but they were a bit hit or miss as far as difficulty level and instructor and a few times I showed up to the class being cancelled (-- 1/2 star).\n\nHere's what I LOVED:\n--Extreme Fit with Steve-This class repeatedly destroyed me- in a great way.\n--Spinning with Shoshana-she's super nice and helpful, and then she gets on the bike and screams at you and it's awesome.\n--Hip Hop with Jamie-awesome music, and a great workout.\n\n\nHere's what classes weren't hard enough for me, but still good. Some of these classes attract an older (retiree) crowd, which slows the pace of the class.\n--Zumba with Sonia and Gail- I've been to hard Zumba classes, these were not a big workout, but still fun. More dance step focus than cardio.\n--Yoga Stretch and Athletic Yoga- great studio but not intense/ yogi enough classes for me.\n--Interval Training with Bob-jumping on trampolines for 30 minutes is fun but...not enough.\n--Taifit/bound abs-ok, I thought it would be harder.\n\nAlso tried the Boxer's workout with Cliff and TRX with Deryl-great workout but not enough music/fun for me, and smelly gloves for boxing.  Abs classes were good too but nothing crazy.\n\nI'LL MISS YOU SPORTING CLUB AT THE BELLEVUE. MAYBE I'LL COME BACK WHEN I'M DEBT FREE AND HAVE A SALARY. sigh. weep.",

The gym's decent and the monthly price is what hooked me, but good luck canceling your membership.\n\nI was a happy City Fitness member for about a year but then I moved. So in early 2010 I called and cancelled my membership over the phone. I didn't realize I had to submit written notice. Neither did the person I spoke with on the phone. I guess they were new or something, but they accepted my cancellation and I stopped being charged.\n\nAfter a few months I started receiving debt collection notifications in the mail and immediately called City Fitness to find out why. I explained my situation and was transferred to a membership services rep. I explained my situation again; the representative told me that the person I previously spoke to should not have accepted a phone cancellation, but she assured me that she would take care of it and everything was fine. I didn't hear anything after that for months and months (while in the meantime receiving \"We want you back\" cards in the mail), until a few months ago I received a call from some lawyer in Las Vegas, saying that I owed six hundred and some dollars to City Fitness and threatening to bring a law suit against me.\n\nI immediately called the gym and was put through to Jeff Quinn. He seemed very understanding and told me to email him with all the information I'd just told him over the phone and that he'd take care of it. Well it's been over three months now and I'm still receiving phone calls from Swift Financial (the collection agency) almost every day. I've emailed Jeff a few more times and have called countless times, but somehow he's always busy or out of the office. Needless to say, he never returns my calls.\n\nUnconscionable. I'll update this post if I ever hear anything back from City Fitness.",

  "text": "LA fitness in Fort Washington is a decent gym, but they could do much better.\n\nHonestly, I only signed up there because it is close to work and I can go on my lunch break. Plus it's a chain and I can use any of them, which is good because I live far away and I like to travel. \n\nBut as a gym itself, its a little outdated and they really could use some new equipment and I agree, the TVs are always on the same channels so if there is something you want to watch or even look at you better get a treadmill or elliptical by it or you are SOL.",

  "text": "Not sure why this OT has such negative reviews- most of them have to do with billing/accounting which IMO shouldn't be taken into consideration when reviewing the workout. \n\nAnyway, with that being said, I love OT. Kelly is absolutely the best trainer- she genuinely wants to see you succeed and is so supportive. There are so many class times so you have no excuse for not being able to make it to a class. Yes it's pricier than a normal gym membership - I have the 8 classes a month for $99 package, but it's like having a gym membership and personal trainer all in one. For me, it's a much more effective workout than a gym because you're told exactly what to do, but can go at your own pace. \n\nI love OT and will continue to get my splat points!",

I had to stop my membership in 2020 due to Covid and losing my job, but now I'm back as so so happy. \n\nSouth Rac's facility always seems very clean to me. Whenever I go into the women's locker room, I usually see an employee coming in and/or out from checking to make sure everything is ship-shape. I also feel like everyone who uses the lockers is very respectful - I've never seen any misbehavior when in the locker room. \n\nSouth Rac's amenities are awesome. Though there is no pool, there is everything else you could want. Plenty of different types of weights, CrossFit type bars/weights, machines, treadmills, rowing machines... Even the massive incline that is in the gym is fun to utilize! \n\nThe staff at South RAC are also pretty great. Everyone is friendly and anytime I've noticed something and went to the front desk to mention it, they're always all ears and very helpful. The instructors of the classes have been warm and friendly. I don't go to classes very often but everyone I've interacted with is great. \n\nOverall, this is a bit more expensive of a gym but totally worth it if you're on the edge. \n\n10/10 recommend",

  "text": "Because I have to workout harder than most, I decided to joined the Y. Although Northwest is not my preferred Y in Middle Tennessee, I do enjoy the group fitness classes here. The group exercise classes are perfect for all fitness levels, from beginner to advanced and even those awkward individuals who lack rhythm & coordination.  Unfortunately this facility gets three stars due to the poor conditions of the female locker room and shower area. IT IS DISGUSTING! Some people do not have home training!!! Large water puddles on the floor, food left on the floor (i.g. Cheetos, french fries, chicken bones, dirty diaper under the bench, etc), weave in the sink and on the floor, plastic bags left in the shower stalls and on the floor, outdated lockers, and the smell of mold, musk, funk, and cheap perfume- just to name a few. The other issue with this Y (that will never be tolerated at other Ys) is the groups of teenagers who are unattended and allowed to hang in the locker rooms on their CELL PHONES taking selfies while people are changing. (WTH)  Overall a good \"social\" gym, but be sure to bring a good lock to secure your belongings.",

Perfect location across from Lucas Park and Main Library, nestled between Locust and Saint Charles at 13th St), you wont need a car to get here, if you live anywhere downtown. If you do have a car, plenty of free, secured parking comes with a membership. Very low-key vibe upon entry and guaranteed you will be greeted and treated as if you are a VIP. The entire staff is member-oriented and go out of their way to make you feel you are working out at home in your rec room...Cleanest gym of any I have been a member, offering racks with plenty of clean towels for both face and equipment along with spray and hand disinfectants. Carpeted floors are vacuumed every day, and bathroom, locker area, and showers are habitually clean. Excellent, extensive, diverse, and redundant (ie no 'weighting/) choice of free weights, cable equipment, machines, core to satisfy the most serious athlete to the novice. Cardio equipment is plentiful but standard; they offer a great view of the park and all the happy dogs, or 9 flat screens with your choice of channels. Excellent group exercise room  to take a standard menu of group classes. If you want personal training, Keith and Kevin are the best in Saint Louis and likely the entire state/Mid-West; just check out their bios, physiques, and overall knowledge; I dare you to ask them about nutrient timing or metabolic efficiency...Bottom line: great gym + great value + great staff + great vibe = great results...",

  "text": "So let me just preface this to say that the ONLY time I am likely to visit a gym out of town is to take a class so I am only generally commenting on the basic experience from the viewpoint of someone who is popping in and out for a class. I'm not on the treadmill (I can do that in the hotel), not hitting the weights, I want group exercise.\n\nI was in town for business (as frikin usual) and had to get in a Zumba class. I was running late to head to another L.A. Fitness class for 5:45 so I decided if I couldn't make it to the 7:00 class I was just a sad case. \n\nAt L.A. Fitness, you can get a 3-day guest pass which I didn't remember when I went in Largo. You'll have to chat it out with a sales guy where they see if you can join but I was really just trying to come to the class and wanted to either be sold a punch card so I can do this in each city I travel or pay per class (which you can for $15 for the day, kinda pricey for a drop in). \n\nNow the good stuff is that I took Zumba with Rodney. He was so amazing I will remember him for months on end. I'm kinda a Zumba junkie now so it helps that I know the general moves and won't fumble around like the only salsa I've seen is with chips. \n\nHis moves are definitely full of cardio and high-impact but they are so sexily done with the dance combination, it's just bliss. Definitely will seek him out when I'm back in town. \n\nNow after going to L.A. Fitness in the Clearwater/Largo area with Anthony and now this one with Rodney, it might be safe to say that L.A. Fitness' \"thing\" is to have awesome instructors with contemporary moves and current music that will get you exactly what you want consistently. \n\nI'll definitely come back here, it's in Hyde Park so a great reason to explore that area a little more. Starting to like Tampa a little bit now (finally). \n\nBest is yet to come!\n\nP.S. Another consistency is the yumma dumma eye-candy swirly-dooing around in there. Deliiiish!",

The cardio equipment is all old and breaking down, hours are limited on the weekend, they always run out of towels, they stopped selling protein shakes and now just sell salads and weird juices, and weights are always laying on the ground, not racked or racked in the wrong places (5 pounds stacked on 10 pounds stacked on 2 and 1/2 stacked on 45).  Even during non peak hours, like 6 on a Sunday, the gym is overcrowded and it can be hard to use necessary equipment. \n\nWas a loyal member, but will probably look elsewhere.

Mostly because of THRIVE MBSC training with Jamel Harris. \n\nJamel is an awesome trainer who will listen to your goals and athletic history and then form a plan with you to help make your goals reality. He is an excellent athlete who knows how to get more and more out of his clients without pushing you over the edge.  Jamel has plenty of male and female clients, all are very friendly and like to work hard and get in shape. The workouts are tough, and he will push you, but you can expect results like you've probably never experienced before. When I first met Jamel I was at 165 lbs, now about 8 months later I'm at 185 lbs and low body fat. Also, Jamel is not the kind of trainer that barks orders and expects you to know how to do every exercise... he will demonstrate correct form and teach you whatever you want to learn again and again until you're comfortable. It doesn't matter if your goal is to lose weight, gain muscle mass, or just live more healthfully... Jamel is the choice.",

  "text": "I will give LA Fitness credit for keeping up the appearances of ALL their Tucson clubs!  Well done... This club just went through a week of cosmetic renewal including new and improved flooring.  The down side is the California based management team chose to keep many of the crappy Star Trac exercise machines rather than trade them out for better Life Fitness/Hammer equipment. They did get rid of the crappy Star Trac elliptical cardio machines but replaced them with a low end Matrix ellipticals rather than purchasing a better model of the Matrix elliptical that includes adjustable incline as well as adjustable resistance.  \n\nI generally choose this club for morning cardio and light workouts with a friend, but use the original Tucson LA on Ina Road for more intense resistance workouts because it has smartly retained much of its \"old school\" and  more effective Life Fitness  and Hammer equipment. \n\nIn general LA Fitness locations provide a decent workout experience for the average fitness enthusiast. A more hard core, power lifting or CrossFit athletes are better off at gyms in Tucson that cater to their sports. \n\nMy on going complaint with LA Fitness is the company's policy regarding disposable employees. Massive turnover in personnel has occurred in Tucson for each of the last 15 years. I don't even try to get to know anyone who works at any club now, because I know in 3-4 months they will be replaced with another new person. \n\nThe personal training staff is the lone exception to the revolving door of employees.

The staff is helpful and it's pretty clean considering. The only downside is that it is expensive. Especially if you plan on going frequently. But I feel it's easily worth the money. They are constantly changing the different climbs available but have enough walls so that they remain available for quite some time. Also, they offer a good amount of bouldering and 4 auto-belays.",

  "text": "Let me start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of giving less than 5 stars but in this case I'll make the play. \n\nIt's worth admitting my kids LOVE coming here. If they were writing the review they'd absolutely give 5 stars plus!  For that reason they get a 4 rather than my initial 3 star selection. \n\nMy problem: there is NO comfortable seating! No couches. No cozy chairs (other than the massage chairs that cost something like $5 for 20 minutes (I could be off here) on which I've totally wasted $40 in one afternoon!!!!   There are only cheap bistro or cafe style chairs and tables. (Side note: they're great for bringing your laptop and getting some work done. So use it as work time if you like) \n\nAlso, there was a giant rip in one of the big tramps that an employee told me management wouldn't fix but they pour money into their other location. Hmm. \n\nSo sure, take your kids but also take something to read or work on (in MY opinion). Staff is ok. I will say a couple times they employee(s) would get in and play with the kids. They LOVED that!!!! So thanks and that's another reason they got a 4!  \n \nBless them!",

This may be the nicest Y I've ever been in, and I travel for work and have used several up and down the east coast.\n\nCommenting on the fitness center, the cardio and weight room. Very impressive selection of high end equipment. Someone else commented on the size of the change facilities. Yes, they seemed rather small when I first used them in fact that is everyone's first impression. However, I've not yet seen them crowded. Maybe that is because there are separate change rooms for men, boys, women and girls, and a family change room, five in total.  So like a multi-lane highway the usage gets spread out and just our lane seems empty. Just my idea, I've only been in the men's room.\n\nThe facility is architecturally pleasing to look at, from the outside and inside.  And the fitness center has glas windows on two sides, looking out on the \"campus\" parking lot and the nice, new lobby.\n\nI wish this was my home Y.",

If you choose all strength, you repeat the same exercises twice in a row while the other participants switch between running and strength.

I am now in physical therapy because of this pain (which did not go away and only got worse).

Next, while the gym is big, the majority of the space is devoted to classes that you have to pay extra for in addition to your monthly membership.\n\nAs far as service goes, the staff doesn't know how to do anything if it isn't saying \"hello\" as you walk in the door.  Service is terrible and there are a ton of hidden fees.  Beware - they will charge you often for things in addition to the monthly rates.\n\nParking is also a nightmare.",

  "text": "Being a consistent gym goer for the last 8 years I take pride in the locations I workout at. \n\nPositives:\nThis gym is very clean. There is no dumbbells left on the floor or plates all over. There is no dust all over machines or trash on the ground. The free weights go up to 120lbs which is great for people like myself where 100 just doesn't cut it. The free weight area has a nice thick rubber floor so when you do put down weights it is not loud and obnoxious. The machines have an interesting switch system to change weights instead of the traditional pin system. This is nice because you don't have to worry about losing pins. I have been a trainer myself for 5 years with a masters in exercise science and I can say the training staff is very personable. They are good with communication with their clients and are very presentable. Not sure their backgrounds or certs but they at least come off like they know what their doing if they do not. The front desk staff is very nice. The gym also sells some quality supplements like O.N. This is nice to see that they are not pushing their own knock off products. The smoothie bar has some good options and are pretty good with options to add extra protein glutamine, creatine, etc. The classroom seems to be pretty nice and personally knowing some of the instructor from my previous gym they are good. The kids club looks nice but I have no personal experience there. The movie theater is an awesome plus. I did not think I would like it until I went in while Christmas vacation was on and ended up doing 30 minutes of cardio without realizing it. They also have some nice additions in the free weight area such as a hex bar, 2 racks of pre loaded straight and EZ bars, TRX bands, heavy bag, kettle bells and plyo boxes. The gym does have WIFI which is a huge plus since the cell service is terrible. There is also daily specials and smoothie punch cards to earn free smoothies. This is pretty cool and a good incentive to purchase protein shakes. There is also a points program where you earn points for checking in, doing challenges, buying shakes, etc that earn you things like gifts, free shakes, free months and so on. I caught a deal in December with 5 dollar enrollment for 20 a month which is a steal. There is an annual fee of 39 dollars but that still comes out to less than 25$ a month which is the cheapest around. The members for the most part are not your annoying people who sit there on a bench and talk and text which is a big plus.\n\nNegatives:\nThe first thing you will notice is the gym is surely small. It has a lot but in a very small area. It gets congested with the amount of equipment they have to the point where walking with weights in the free weight area is difficult and unloading the benches and the leg press is difficult. There is also only one designated free squat rack but it is open most of the time. There is not much room to do floor exercises such as dead lifts or walking lunges. There is no designated area to do core for those who like mats. The cardio machines are frail and are not of the highest quality but their TVs on the machines are awesome. The bathrooms are very small. God help the person who has to go on a day when more than 2 people had taco bell the night before. \n\nAll in all this is a quality gym for those who are looking to get a great workout in and don't want to deal with people who are just there to BS.",

I appreciate how you are able to do everything via the website so if you're coming straight from work there's no payment or having to see what bike is left situation. The outside of the building was pretty run of the mill so I was surprised at how hip the interior decor was. Everything was very clean, tidy and modern. The instructor took their time to meet with everyone and set your bike to fit you so that you wouldn't be straining or 'uncomfortable'. I say 'uncomfortable' because no matter how much time they took the bike seat was still very small and narrow. As a bottom heavy woman you might as well have said make yourself comfortable straddling a butter knife while pedaling for an hour. It was a little unexpected that when the class begin the lights were lowered with just ambiance lighting left and the awesome dance music was really pumping! Gave the whole room a club like atmosphere which really helped me to focus on the motivating coaching to 'KILL THIS HILL!'  Overall it was a really environment to get a decent workout in and the first class is free so you might as well give it a shot! \n\nPros: Great atmosphere, Friendly and helpful staff and no gym snobs in attendance \n\nCons: My lady parts are still sore from the butter knife I mean bike seat",

Also, after they sanitize the sauna they NEVER rinse the bleach & the wood just rots more over time.  I've worked in 5 star resorts & restaurants, it's not that hard, just disinfect & wait x amount of time & then rinse it with a hose.\n\nI have contacted management via telephone once before & nothing got done.  \n\nThen weeks later, yet again another massive splinter almost killed me as I laid down in the sauna -- could of easily had this monster puncture the back of cervical spine.

I'm not deducting for the facility, or the staff (who are all great and personable) but I'm specifically deducting for a new corporate policy.  They no longer sell \"one-week\" temporary passes for $40 to visitors.  Instead they sell one day passes for $15 a day.  In other words the corporate big shots (B.S.) are clearly trying to rip off the public and line their pockets.  That is unacceptable.  Shame on you.  You have lost a lot of respect.",

  "text": "Rock climbers are strong and smart. Well, the whole death defiance aspect of the sport borders on the less than sharp. So I'm visiting Tucson when I get the\"call of the wall\" - that's my way of saying that I want to rock climb. I yelped for more info and found Rocks and Ropes.\n\nThe place has close to 50 top ropes at 35 feet high and a several lead areas including a nice tall cave. Their bouldering area proved to be harder than most with taped, but unrated routes. That also goes with the rest of the gym, a lot of the climbs were unrated. Ah, be not discouraged oh, rock hugger because Rocks and Ropes has a member rated system where they take an average opinion of a climb and rate it later. That means that the setter's opinion is not law. I like!\n\nSo when I actually climbed I found that the gym offers climbs for beginners and elite athletes. It's challenge level, based on the climbing on nearby Mount Lemon, tends to fall a bit on the harder side for the higher rated routes. Tall climbing and plentiful top roped walls round this off as one of the best indoor places I've climbed - ever.\n\nThe rap:\n- $12.00 entry fee (average)\n- Inexpensive rentals ($6.00 each for harness or shoes - average)\n- Military / Student Monty Discount ($45 - nice).\n- Daily Specials (Mondays and Fridays are best $9.00 entry fee)\n- Nice adder: Guided trips to Mount Lemon\n\nRounding up, I found this to be a fun place to climb some rather high indoor walls. The gym offers a lot of unusual features that should train even the best climber for the hard climbs out in the Mt. Lemon area. Climb on!",

If you are interested in something fitness related, chances are these guys have it here. I am more of a power lifter and the equipment here is great. The cardio equipment is always clean and working properly/smoothly. Even though I don't take classes, there seems to be a ton to choose from. Boxing, racket ball courts, NBA sized basketball court, pool, sauna, whirl pool, elevated running track.... If you can think of it, they have it. This place justifies the member dues they ask for. Great investment for those serious about leading a fit lifestyle.",

They made me buy gloves which was a waste, I won't be back.. They should have loaners for first time., I would LOVE my $20 back!!! The workout  itself was very boring. A lot of standing around.  I'm upset I wasted my Saturday workout here... They also do not have just one off classes they try to sell you a full time membership... Seems. Silly to have an unlimited work out here..

  "text": "If you're just looking for a bare bones gym, this place is it. There are always cardio and weight machines available, even at busy times and because it share a parking lot with Home Depot, finding a space for your car is never an issue. Like all other Planet Fitnesses, this location is open 24 hours and only closes occasionally for holidays (for most holidays, they're open anyway but have limited hours). It was great to be able to fit in a workout early on Thanksgiving morning. The staff at this location are also really nice and the showers, locker room, and bathroom areas all seem clean (and you'll always see one of the employees cleaning something while you're there).\n\nI do have two minor gripes. One is that people working out don't seem to wipe down the equipment after they use it (even though there is signage to the contrary). That's not really the fault of Planet Fitness as they have cleaner and paper towels readily available throughout the facility, but it's still pretty gross. I'd recommended a pre-wipedown of cardio equipment and a thorough hand washing once you're home.\n\nThe other thing that bothers me is that a lot of people talk on their cell phones while on the cardio equipment. It's really distracting and annoying to have someone chatting away in your ear. I usually crank up my headphones and deal with it, but it's one of the specific rules that you sign for in the gym's contract -- and the employees don't seem to do anything to enforce it or even notice.\n\nOtherwise, a great place if you just want to workout in a climate controlled environment but don't require too many bells and whistles to be happy.",

I am from out of state where gyms like this are common! Fancy and luxury. But moving to florida and researching dozens of gyms, I only seem to find planet and L.A fitness. Gross! Those gyms are always overcrowded and smelly. This is the first gym that I walked into and could see the expensive side of it. Well dressed and friendly staff. Clean halls. Luxury bathrooms and spas. You pay for what you get! Sometimes after a workout I need to go to dinner or family and I love the option of blowdryers, razors and toothbrushes! You don't need to drive home and get ready! The actual gym itself is small but never crowded. Friendly people. I keep seeing people complain after others not sanitizing like give me a break! What were you doing before this pandemic? No one ever sanitized unless it was a staff member cleaning. Seriously stay home if you're that much of a germ freak. Anyways, the machines are great (very versatile). The whole place is perfect. My only issue is that they don't have a pool! Hopefully in the future they open up one in a neighbor city that is bigger!\n\nSide note: the lifetime spa is amazing! I got my hair done by Hailey and she did an amazing job! Very communicative and nice. Professional people all around. Great service.",

Through out the gym is clean...some of the personal trainers are lacking the im a friendly person attitude...but other than that. You have really serious lifters cause their clothes are matchy matchy. So you know they serious. Staff was quite not real friendly but you weight the pros and cons...friendly staff or clean toliet.

So when I saw the Gilt City for Body Cycle Spinning Studio couldn't pass the opportunity up to try this place at a discounted rate, I had already heard awesome things.\n\nIf you are into spinning this is the place to be.  There are tons of class times, some of the more popular ones do fill up lucky for me I work a slightly odd schedule and that doesn't effect me much except occasionally on the weekends.  All of the staff has been super friendly and accommodating.  The instructors are great they have a variety of styles and you can learn something different from each one to improve your performance and technique.  If your not a fan of one you can usually avoid them. \n\nBody Cycle Spinning Studio spicy things up with themed rides and workshops.  I was able to attend the Glow Ride which was pretty cool.  They also gave out a free ride and bottle of champagne to one randomly selected spinner who came on valentines day I didn't win but it was cool to have a shot.  In addition there customer service is awesome some of us got left in the cold because the person was late to open the studio and they comped us a ride.",

I tried the one week free membership trial, and maybe I just had a bad experience, but truly, this place seems mediocre at best. The person who set up my membership gave me absolutely no useful information, just pushed a card at me and told me to have at it. When I asked for a rundown of the facility, policies, membership options, etc., she was nice enough, but not helpful. She basically said, cardio on this side, weights on that side, hope you enjoy. She also kept calling me \"hon,\" which I find so condescending. I asked some questions but finally gave up on getting any useful information out of her. When I came back for a second visit, the door was locked. She had failed to mention that this was the case during some hours and that my trial membership card would not get me in during those times. I was just so put off by this, I decided to try other places. As for the facilities, they're fine - nothing special. The prices are typical, nothing special here either.",

  "text": "It's possible I don't know what I'm talking about because I never belonged to a gym before, but this place is awesome! It's huge inside with a ton of cardio machines (ellipticals, bikes, treadmills) on one side, and lots of weight stuff on the other side. Then there is the movie theater room. That's right, it has a dark room with a giant screen that you can watch movies while running on a treadmill or stretching out in the back. It's perfect for the days when you forget your headphones or just don't feel like being seen working out by others, like I often do... I don't look pretty when I'm sweating my a** off.\n\nThere are personal trainers too that you can make appointments with to set up and stay on track with your fitness routine and goals. New members get their first training session for free! Nanci, my trainer for the day, was super knowledgeable and so motivating. She even told me I have a great physique and that it's perfect for working out and attaining my goals. She even thought I had been an athlete in the past. Now maybe she was just buttering me up, but it felt good to hear some positive things to keep me going. She said she had the feeling I'd be a gym rat in no time, which I scoffed at, but now after feeling the workout and being a little sore this morning, I'm psyched to get back there. It was exactly the kind of motivation I needed to get out of my rut and stop feeling so badly about myself.\n\nRetro Fitness is cheap too. They have specials for joining all the time, we signed up for a dollar, and the membership is only $20 a month. You can't beat that. This place is great and I know I'll be in shape come my wedding in the fall :)",

  "text": "The Y is the best! Well, there are always things that can be improved but I must say, in terms of standard gyms that one can join, the YMCA network is hard to beat. The fact that it is a registered non-profit and really strives to live up to its mission statement is a testament to the success of the organization and the dedication of its staff and its members. There are plentiful community programs to join, with topics raining from cancer to self-defense, to senior specific programs and fun runs, all of which promote a holistic approach to wellness.\n\nI've only been to the downtown Y, so this review is strictly for that location. Despite initially getting turned around by the awkward layout, once I had been a few times, it was no longer something I thought about.  I tend to primarily go on days I'm not working (which include random weekdays) and thus typically can avoid major crowds. The few times I have gone during peak pre/post work hours, it can indeed be busy, but what gym isn't? That said, I've never *not* been able to find a cardio machine between the various rooms, as most people are respectful of the suggested 30 min time limits. And while the classes can fill up, the instructors do their best to accommodate everyone who shows up, even if you're a bit late. I appreciate how a latecomer can \"interrupt\" the vibe of a room, but the Y is all about getting people to live a healthy lifestyle, and turning people away or shaming them is not conducive to that, so I greatly applaud this \"all are welcome\" approach. If you're looking for a pretentious place, look elsewhere. I've yet to meet a grumpy employee or staff member, and everyone is always so kind and helpful.\n\nAs for specifics, the adult women's changing room has plenty of lockers and is spacious. I have not used the showers or sauna, it's not really my thing, but they are available. I do not use a bath towel service, but do use the sweat towels provided and appreciate their availability. When I joined, I was given a thorough tour of the facility; there are also personal trainers that can set you up on a routine and teach you how to safely use the equipment if needed. I love love love the variety of classes, and there are ample free weights (as well as circuit machines) for use. There are 2 pools, but again, this isn't my thing so I haven't experienced them directly, though they always seem to be busy with kid or adult programs as well as free swim times. \n\nIf you're looking for a place to boost up or maintain your health and wellness, look no further. You will not regret it.",

Shirene is amazing because when you need to change your life you can't be babied; she and the entire team of trainers and front desk staff put 100% into making sure everyone who joined the six week challenge got results. They educated us on how to eat, what to eat and when to eat. They pushed us in our workouts every day and if we didn't show up, they called us and made sure we stayed on track even when life got hectic as it always will! They celebrated us each week as we lost more and more weight and inches and encouraged us throughout the way, because most of the staff are previous challengers! so they know first hand what we were going through. I just finished the six weeks and I lost 17.6 pounds!!! I lost a LOT of inches even better. I gained control of my eating and I love the energy, self-confidence and self-love they've given me and I've worked for. I can honestly say this place changed my life. The people, the other challengers, the members, the staff, the coaches, shirene- you guys are the REAL DEAL!",

For $8 you get to participate in a 15 minute combat type adventure in a dark room with lots of glow in the dark and neon. The group is divided into 2 groups-red vs blue.

What I eventually found out was that they were rated high...which only eased my pain a little.  \nEventually I grew to like the challenge that the setters presented and along with the steep overhang wall my climbing advanced very quickly as well as my strength.  \nThe staff are very nice, super friendly and helpful, everyone is willing to help with beta.\nI had a very difficult time breaking into the 5.11 and 5.12 range at this gym, the routes are set so that it's impossible to reach some holds if you're shorter than 5'9\" tall.  I've even had the employees and setters tell me it's not possible, which makes it hard to advance beyond a certain point there.  \nSaturdays they have \"Kid's Climb\" and it's kids only from 9 to 11, parents should check it out, it'll tire them out pretty good and it's fun for the belay volunteers.",

It is more like the YMCA but not as nice. \n\nThings that are good. The food is actually quite good. The soup actually is VERY good. It is homemade and they do make some awesome soup. The rest of the menu is pretty good, although I do wish there were more healthy options for a Fitness Club.\n\nThe pool is awesome about 10 months a year. It is heated but 3 months a year it is too cold.

The facility was lacking at that time, but by December 2012, this place was in shambles: no toilet paper, no hand towels, no heat in the bathroom, no water to drink, an instructor who was often late or absent (thus, no class) or showed up with an ankle braclet monitor (you know, the kind prisons like to give out).  It could hardly get worse. But, it did.\n\nBy mid-December, I received emails about fraud, new ownership, potential improvements, and class changes.  I had purchased a membership that allowed me to attend Monday through Friday at 7:00 a.m. But, the emails said the 7:00 a.m. class was cancelled, with the exception of Tuesdays and Thursdays when it would be continuing, except for holidays, which, oh by the way, just happened to fall on Tuesdays. So, the $100+ membership I paid for was converted unilaterally from a five-days-a-week to a one-day-a-week class.  When I signed up for the classes, I was told that I could use some non-7:00 a.m. class time to make up for missed time due to prepaid vacation and work trips in early December. By mid December, there was no chance that was going to happen.  My ten week program turned into about five sessions - that's it.\n\nBy January 2013, more emails, and the place seemed to be closed, with owners, former owners, fraudulent owners, and hopeful owners sorting out business.  I have given up on ever getting the value of the 10-week package I had purchased, and in fact, there is no one at Rowzone, it seems to me, able to speak for the former, fraudulent or would-be owner under whose watch the package was purchased.  \n\nThis weekend, however, sparked another development in the Rowzone Saga.  I received an email that sounds like Rowzone is up and running, the website will be opened to scheduling, and while the new(?) owner will not be able to reimburse me for the prior program I purchased, she will recognize the vouchers that I bought for five sessions (an additional $70 bucks). \n\nI am going to go to the voucher funded sessions. I will write a review on the revamped place, assuming it is actually in business, and you can decide if this will work for you. For me, I am cautiously optimistic.",

If you don't know what's going on over there you need to look into it and there are bums living in the back of the location. So women really need to watch out. It is not a fake review.

Ive never had to wait to use anything or fight with a person who was hogging the smith machine or cables.\n\n2. Towel Service- I  always forget to pack one. No worries when I go here\n\n3. Basketball, Pool, and Racquetball Courts- I dont use them, but if I ever wanted to at least the are there.\n\n4. TV's on the Cardio machines...every single one- No need to rush home to watch Scandal when you need to get that cardio in.\n\n5. Clean!- Some of these LA fitness or ex Lifestyle fitness need some serious maintenance \n\n6. Staff- I don't interact with them much, but they seem fine.\n\n7. Smoothie Shop- You can buy supplements and sometimes they have fit life food meals.\n\n8. Parking- there is usually plenty of it, even if you have to go to the top of the garage.\n\nThey have an abs area, I wish they had a designated area for plyos, trx, sprints, stairs or ropes to switch things up a bit, but they have mostly EVERYTHING you will need.",

First off it's super dark and the only light comes from black lights and a couple colored neon type lights in a few spots. Its completely free of any type of body shaming because 1. You can't see, and 2. You're so focused on your own workout and watching and listening to the music being played which by the way is on projected on the front wall. My favorite part I think is at the very end when nice cold wet towels are handed out for cool down. They feel so good! \n\nMy reason for a 4 star instead of 5 is because I kind of felt that there should be an introduction to the area and how it works with waitlists and standbys and general info when you're a new member. Alo, I tried a couple different times to contact Escape by phone and email to ask some questions but never got a response. But finally after I ended up having a little trouble with a purchase online I used Facebook to message the business and I got a response back very quickly and all was fixed. The very last thing is the class packages as well as contact info are different in the app vs. on the website. It just got a little confusing. \n\nOverall I really enjoy going to classes here!",

There is an indoor golf driving range, a dance studio, cardio machines with cable tv, free weights, boxing, these awesome yellow machines that do everything in a circle so you just go from machine to machine and you're done. Nice! Considering I hadn't stepped foot in a gym in a couple decades, I was happily impressed with what I found, and even better, they have a kids club. So I'm now feel guilty for not going to the gym not because I didn't work out, but because my homeschooled son didn't get to play with other kids that day! It's a big incentive to work out!",

Wow !!!\n\nA very well fortified gym with plenty of Life Fitness equipment and a handsome supply of free weights. They have a really high end power rack with removable rack out tiers as well as an integrated spotter platform, so it's surprisingly well suited for my old school squat, dead, bench, pull up, dips, bent-over row and military press workout.  Additionally, if your more suited to isolation machines, then you'll find everything you need to target every major muscle group in your body. There's also a number of machines that will target the smaller muscles as well so their should be something for everyone. \n\nGreat price, great location, incredible variety of the best equipment and 24 hour access. I've been training for over 40 years and this is a decent gym. \n\nThe only criticism I have, and this is shared by many, is the lighting. It's so dark in there that within minutes of arriving I find myself yawning. Poorly lit rooms have been correlated with lethargy in the workplace as low lighting signals the brain that it's time to sleep. It's a gym!!! Turn the lights up!!!",

  "text": "In a city full of workout classes ranging from bootcamp to crossfit to dance to spin to cheer inspired cardio (yup. it's a real thing), why WOULDN'T there be a rowing-based workout? I just checked out my first one and, while I'll go ahead and agree it's a good workout, I'll also say that I'm glad it's not the only show in town. I've been around rowers a lot lately, and realize that the instructions RowZone gives are definitely on-point there. The style of my workout was a circuit, mixing erging with weights and body-weight exercises focusing on legs, core, and shoulders/forearms. \n\nThe 45 minutes sped by, which I really liked, and the facilities, while small and unassuming, are very clean and brightly lit. You can definitely focus on improving your form in the mirrors, and there is enough space between machines to feel comfortable.\n\nI wouldn't make this the only workout I'd do in Philly, but I think it's a great addition to a cross-training routine.",

  "text": "I LOVE this place!! I live right nearby, so more often than not, I walk to and from the gym. I signed up with my dad in July 2015 because the yoga studio I went to (Banyan Yoga & Ayurveda) was in the same building, although it ultimately closed down. I wanted to start getting fit again. I now go 6 days per week, often times to all the great fitness classes they offer if you get a Gold Membership. The best classes are the B-Fit Boot Camp (even though it's at like 5AM) on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Zumba on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the Core Synergy class on Wednesdays and Fridays. Oh, and also the Total Body Workout on afternoons Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It's not super big but the gym's got everything you need in there, really good equipment, really clean, friendly people, TVs, and great personal trainers. The only complaint I'd give is that sometimes they play music in there that isn't fit for working out (Taylor Swift, Adele, Shawn Mendes), but there's probably someone out there that appreciates that: it's mostly a preference thing. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place. I already got my mom and brother to sign up as well.",

I particularly like the space because there's plenty of indoor and outdoor room. \n\nTom - the coach - was fantastic. The reason I am giving NSCF 5 stars is simple = excellent results. I am an active person who is willing to spend on \"exercise\" and this was one of the best investments I have made for myself. \n\n1. Tom provides a productive environment where everyone is focused on progress and growth, without there being a sense of intimidation. I am able to be motivated by everyone around me, track my progress, learn and grow from everyone - and receive personalized guidance from Tom.\n\n2. Tom \"met\" me halfway. He was able to identify my strengths and weaknesses, point out the subtle changes I needed to make, and advise me during each class. There were exercises I was already good at that I didn't think I would get any better at - yet I did! And there were exercises I never thought I would be able to do - and I made great progress. I also witnessed Tom work with complete novices who made similar advances and that was great process to be a part of and witness as well.\n\n3. No B.S. No complicated forms or systems or hurdles - show up and work out. Though I did hesitated slightly because of a 1 star review regarding the financial agreements, I did not experience this at all. Everything was transparent and clear and Tom was willing to answer all my questions and concerns beforehand by phone and email.",

I have never had to talk to them. I don't have a review of the classes because I don't really take classes, but I hear they have or had some Les Mills classes which people seem to like. I dont really like the locker rooms though, they feel a little run down. I never see people around cleaning either.

  "text": "I did a jumpstart program with them in August of 2019 that was promoted by CKO through Facebook. I met with a coach and was promised personal coaching and diet plan as well as unlimited classes for 70 a month. If you attended three classes a week you were only locked in for a month, if you failed that requirement you were locked in for a year. \n\nThis place was so deceitful it was actually sickening. I came to find that the coach that sold me on the contract was in no way related to cko or even from Philadelphia. I signed up with multiple women who came from outside the city and really wanted to change, but we weren't warned that the three class requirement was nearly impossible because each class books up two weeks prior and we were limited to only certain times. Complete scam. I feel so sorry for the women who had to travel. \n\nI completed the classes and requirements per my contract (with no coach or fitness plan) and TODAY! After months of getting NO notification from cko, I received a call from collectors asking for upwards of 800 dollars. \n\nThat's a personal experience, but in regards to the gym in general... it's in a barely breathable basement, in the three months I worked out I wasn't greeted personally once by the front desk nor the coaches and the one time I used the shower the drain was filled with hair. \n\nI love the CKO franchise. I've been to CKO yardley and it's EXCELLENT. This was the biggest mistake I have ever ever made. I'm sad to have to leave this review but i hope it helps anyone who could be fooled by their Facebook promotions.",

My E-Fit training experience with Daniel has been undeniably one of the best things that I have done for myself. Not to mention that  you feel like you are entering a high-end salon, not a typical gym, with plenty of privacy and amenities!  This new location is the envy of other training studios and gyms!",

The Corporate does not answer complaints, just refers them back to the Manager. She might call to ask if there is anything she might do, LMAO.\nComplaints referred to the club itself are never answered. The staff is very nice and friendly, not sure how. This is ONE of the only LAFitness that actually has a cleaning staff that knows how to clean. Tri-City Plaza and Seminole need to take a lesson. Those two are the slimiest and dirtiest in the entire area. Mold/Mildew in between the grout of the tile, Slimy shower stalls, the walls are never cleaned, slick floors with black stains, DISGUSTING. And these are two of the newest! \nBTW LAFitness advertises a Pool, Sauna, Whirlpool etc. THIS club has a sauna that is not kept clean with NO amenities of the other clubs. WHAT am I paying for then? \nI DO NOT recommend LAFitness at any cost. AVOID!!!",

  "text": "So here's the breakdown:\n\nPros:  convenient location, decent amount of equipment to choose from.  Janitorial staff is incredibly friendly (even though I think they could double that staff).\n\nCons:  Not very clean and maintenance in the machines is lacking.  Front desk staff is either nice or absolutely horribly rude (depends on who you talk to).  I've literally been taken aback by how someone spoke to me.  Perhaps too little pay for the work?  The team can sometimes look miserable.  Take care of your employees and they will take care of your customers.\n\nHours are limited if you have a crazy schedule, wish there was a way to make it 24 hours.  Pool is far too small.  The hard sell on a personal trainer is exhausting.  \n\nLast but certainly not least is the outrageous effort to cancel your membership.  You have to either mail a form or go in person.  No luck doing it online or over the phone.  Oh and by the way, when you go in person you might wait an hour for the one guy who is allowed to do it (operations manager).  Oh and that person may not do it properly so weeks later you may realize your membership was never cancelled... And back you go. \n\nTons of potential... But overall a disappointment.\n\nUpdate: it's been a week since I \"cancelled\" and I just received an email that they are charging me again.  Back I go... Another hour wasted to just finish this thing.  The original cancellation never took, now I owe more money.  At 9 months pregnant and being forgotten while I wait for the ops manager again, I just asked if they could finally finish it all if I pay them one last time.  I had to leave because I was about to burst into tears due to frustration.  They were apologetic but at this point I just didn't have the energy to fight anymore.",

I have been going here for a little bit now and have really enjoyed it!  I have been working out with my trainer Ben S and his team and it makes for a great experience for all of us!  \n\nThis is in a great location and is very central in the city!  The location provides off street parking and requires key card to get in!  Once inside the gym has plenty of machines, free weights, treadmills,  ellipticals, bikes, and machines that help with your exercise needs!  \n\nThe trainers at this gym are amazing!  The trainers are apart of confluence training group which is run by Ben S.  If you are looking to do a total fitness change then Ben and his team can guarantee that for you!  They will not only work on the goals that you set for yourself but they will make it so that you are capitalizing on all that you want to do!  \n\nBen also runs a Tuesday morning workout group in Forest Park knows as Confluence ASF group.  This is a free class that meets at worlds fair pavilion at 6 am on Tuesdays!  \n\nSnap fitness is a perfect 100th post for me because it shows what I want to accomplish with my next year!  This added with my Yelp community and make it worth going to the gym so I can go out and write more reviews!!!",

I've seen girls (some clearly weighing less than 80lbs, no kidding) on treadmills here for literally 2+ hours a day when it's packed (they're clearly unwell and that's concerning, but they are also hogging needed machines way beyond reason). I've seen people literally throwing kettlebells, or taking naps on the mats. I've seen people hanging out on machines in jeans and sandals on the floor. The staff does nothing.\n\nOn too many occasions did I also walk in to find no towels, towel bins overflowing, all wipe dispensers empty, every machine occupied, every locker full, bags and shoes covering the floor of the locker room - no room to breathe. The fitness assessments are literally done in a closet. CF needs to put time restrictions on people or limit the number of people who can have evening memberships somehow, amp up their staff during peak hours, and get on the floor and run house if they want to charge prices like this. For that kind of crap, I could pay $10 a month for a Planet Fitness.",

We had \"Charlie\" as our volunteer helper.  All the volunteers were helpful, patient, friendly, and knowledgeable.  The kids had a great time and it was no problem that some kids were better or more daring climbers than others.  Each could go at their own pace.

They provide towels and I have seen some people take as many as 4 towels to their bike...I am not joking about the sweat. If you are a first timer they will show you how to set up your bike and remind you to take the class at your own pace. The best part about the studio is their involvement with the community.

  "text": "When it comes to fitness, I've never found anything as empowering, effective, or addicting as Crossfit. And when it comes to Crossfit gyms, there's no gym better than Crossfit Delaware Valley. Rob Miller has created an atmosphere in which \"athletes\" of all ability levels -- from moms to marines -- can push themselves and each other to reach new, unexpected levels of success in the gym and beyond.   \n\nI moved to Delco in 2008, after occasionally Crossfitting for nearly a year in Connecticut. From my first workout at Crossfit Delaware Valley, I knew it was something special. The way the gym embraced me and welcomed me to the group was incredible. In the months that followed, Rob, his trainers, and the gym community helped me to find new levels of mental and physical strength.   \n\nIt's hard to articulate just how much personal growth I attribute to Crossfit Delaware Valley. The physical achievements, like my very first \"muscle up,\" are too many to list, and the growth in mental strength is just astounding.   \n\nCall Rob. Try a workout. It'll change your life.",

I moved out of state and could no longer use the membership, they tried to charge me 100 dollars to cancel it.  I realized that it would actually cost me more money to cancel than to just let the membership expire.  Until I started seeing these hidden \"building upgrade\" fees.  Like I want to be paying for building upgrades in a gym I can't use.  And thanks so much French Riviera fitness for letting me know that so I could take that into consideration when weighing the cost of your criminally absorbant cancellation fee against the cost of the membership.  Unbelievable.  Not to mention the complete lack of understanding or compromise when I contacted customer service with my situation.  I hope these people go out of business.",

That being said it is more of a 3.5 than a true 4.\n\nThis location is bigger (i would say 3 times), more diversity of cardio equipment (rowing machine yay!), a great industrial size fan, post workout snack bar, they sell supplements, and they have a lot more classes than Bullard.  At least 3 evening classes (5-8) and not the ones where you have to enroll like Canton.  They also have real lockers in the middle of the gym.  I did not check out the restroom/change/shower facilities.\n\nThe personal trainer who was manning the desk did greet me but that may have been because I came in with a member.  However, he did not take any of my information, offer a tour, or give me any information about either the facility or himself. I am not sure why this is a problem.  Personal trainers that are friends of mine are always trying to be friendly because everybody is a potential client.  It doesn't mean that you are Mr. Cheesy sales person but at least show some interest in my existence.  \n\nAnywhoo. Because it is soooo freaking hot now they will get my money for the summer. Working outside is no longer an option and, with all the good food in this town, there is no way I can stay in my same wardrobe and not workout.",

I am used to a busy, big, crazy gym in Vegas where they have an  unlimited amount of equipment. At Saint Marys, they have a good amount of cardio machines, but not much on the strength training, but enough to get by for a good 3 day visit. \nThe pool was probably the best part. Super clean....not many gyms have a clean pool where you feel like you arent going to catch something. \nIf I lived in Reno, I would most likely get a membership here. \nIf you are visiting, you can either get a 3 day guest pass for free, or pay $10 a day. \nAnd they have towel service which is wonderful because usually that is an extra charge at other gyms.",

According to them.\n\nI've used Body Cycle through ClassPass and have not written a public review until now but they accused me of writing a terrible one based on other feedback I gave through ClassPass and threatened a law suit me so I thought, well now's the time to write that bad review!\n\nSo... The maturity level of Shoshanna, the manager, is non-existent.  Some of the teaches there are not great, and I've mentioned that.  She has no tolerance for anyone who doesn't think everyone there is fabulous.  So if you don't like the teacher be on your way or you'll get a nasty email telling you that you are banned from the studio.\n\nThe only teacher there worth taking, in my opinion, is Ross.  He doesn't blast the music and gives instructions you can follow.  He also doesn't make you jump up and down on the bike (not my preference) and do silly claps. I find dance-type style annoying.  Others may like it.  It slowed down the calorie burn in my opinion, and I've been teaching dance and Pilates for 20+ years.\n\nAlso, the classes aren't hard but are okay for only beginners.  If you have any experience you will most likely not feel challenged here.  The bikes have levels you can read on them (some gyms you just turn a knob and never know what the resistance is).  But the technology doesn't compare with Flywheel or Soul Cycle.\n\nI would highly recommend you go elsewhere.  Unless you want to hear empty threats of court proceedings after only getting a mediocre workout.  Not my thing... I just want a decent sweat, not a front row ticket to the People's Court.",

  "text": "I really like R&R and probably would have given it a 5 if it weren't for my first climbing experience being a few weeks earlier at a gym in Scottsdale that I rated a 5. I think the only reason for the 4 is because I think they should add more auto-belays and vary the difficulty of wall where they're placed. Out of the auto-belays they had here I think only 1 was was particularly \"do-able\" for a beginner and not alwaysdo you have someone there to belay you. Perhaps that can be a suggestion to the management (hint-hint).\n\nOther than that, I really enjoyed my day. The staff was very patient and helpful which is always a plus when you have some beginners. I did find some of the walls very hard to do for my level which I found odd, so it's nice to read the other reviews to find out that they are constantly changing the routes. I like climbing so much that I've decided to start training more, so I'm sure I'll be seeing R&R more and more often!\n\nWhen you're done, walk up the street to Barrio for a great local brew!",

Your chances with the old men will be maximized if you suit up in your ribbed, turquoise leggings and fuchsia leg warmers. It's cold outside, anyway. \n\nStart by taking a warm-up lap around the indoor track. It sits right over the main workout room, so you can begin to stalk your prey while you loosen your hammies. Quick stretch and head into the cardio and weight area. If you want to be retro, go with one of their treadmills, otherwise, stay contemporary and jam out on the elliptical. Each new, state of the art machine comes with a personal TV. What's that? There's nothing good on? Screw it, ditch the cardio room and head to the racquetball courts. The men were ugly anyway. \n\nYou can borrow racquets, but as it turns out, the strings are broken or loose. Next time you'll bring your own. \n\nYou're ready to move onto the professional looking athletes. Go to the indoor basketball court. They're all there. Replace your white Reeboks with a pair of Air Jordans. Grab one of the many balls available to you and show them your best alley-oop, double dribble, and half court swoosh. \n\n\"Want to have the physique of a dancer?\" (Yes you do). \"Then the Dancer's Workout class is your workout!  Lean, toned muscles, flexibility, coordination and a fierce attitude!\"  You love things that literally mean what they say they're going to mean.\n\nAfter all this time spent thinking about working out, trying to workout, but just being disinterested by bad TV programming, broken strings, unattractive old and professionally athletic looking men, you're tired, it's time for a dip in the pool, and who could blame you?",

  "text": "LA Fitness is what it is, a cheap convenient gym.  New members should insist on paying $30/mo or less when signing up and make sure you have access to all the regional ones.  If having access to multiple locations isn't a top priority of yours, I would pay more and join a nicer a gym.  After recently acquiring all of the regional Bally's locations, there seems to be one within 15 minutes of you anywhere in the Philadelphia area.  \n\nI've been to most of the LA Fitnesses in the region, and there's things I like and dislike about all of them.  Fort Washington is the one that I typically use, so for now they are getting the review.  I love that they have racquetball courts, which seems to be pretty uncommon in the other area gyms.  You can reserve a court, and there's usually one available (exception is league nights).  The free weights area could be larger and tends to get crowded after work.  There's plenty of nautilus machines.  The cardio equipment is older, but most of it is in working order.  The locker room is clean enough.  It's carpeted, which I actually prefer, but I feel like I'm in the minority on this one.  The lockers are larger than most of the other gyms in the area.  I like how the locker room is set up.  It can get crowded, but it allows for a lot of people to be in there without being on top of one another.  I would never go in the pool, but that's just me.

  "text": "I finally got tired of driving into Philly to go to a gym and decided to check this place out.  It perfectly suits my needs.  The location couldn't be better unless I lived down the street from there.  While some may find it difficult to have to park across the street, trust me, it is far better than having to pay to park in the city, or risk getting a ticket if you overstay in a 2-hour spot (I tend to spend a bit of time in the gym).  I've never had trouble finding a parking space in the large public lot across the street. \n\nI was sceptical about joining a \"chain\" gym, and I had visited another big chain in the area and the place smelled bad and seemed dingy and depressing.  But I was very pleasantly surprised with Planet Fitness, and I have worked out at many gyms including the Sporting Club. This place isn't as luxurious, but it has everything I need at a fraction of the price.\n\nThe equipment is clean and in great condition.  I've not been there in the after-work rush, but any time I've gone, there was no problem getting on any piece of cardio equipment or using any weight machine.  There are two of every weight machine, and I can't even count how many bikes, treadmills and ellipticals.  There is also a free-weight area and a small circuit area.  The locker rooms and bathroom facilities are clean and in perfect working order.  The staff are very friendly. \n\nThey don't provide towels or permanent lockers, and obviously no pool or basketball or racquetball courts, which I assume helps keep the price down.  But if you don't need any of those things, this gym is perfect. Why waste money paying for things you don't use? Hand towels would be a nice plus, but I understand that would add to the staff needed and probably raise the cost.\n\nThe only (minor)  thing I'm disappointed about is the WIFI.  It hardly works.  If you're going to have a  sign in the entrance advertising \"free WIFI!\", you should provide working WIFI - or take the sign down.  I like to watch videos when I'm on a machine, and it eats up a lot of data.  Not a deal-breaker though, since my previous gym had no WIFI either.  I had just hoped I could save a bit on my data usage. Maybe they need to switch carriers. \n\nHighly recommended.",

I looked forward to the days we would meet up for 1-on-1 training and found myself talking to him during that hour for probably longer than I should have but it was hard not to considering how interesting his conversations could be.

Every class is a little different depending on the instructor so you really get the total workout if you go a few times a week and you learn new things about your body and the machine every time! I really love the fact that you don't need to wear shoes, just bare feet or special socks(grippy) that they do sell for a good price! All if the instructors are super friendly, motivating and very knowledgeable! My favorite instructor so far is Lacey! I hadn't worked out for a long time and with her huge beautiful smile, friendliness and super fun, positive attitude, she is just what I need to help me get back into an exercise routine! The equipment is amazing and you will be so surprised at how many different workouts you can get out of one machine! Parking is superb, location is great and they really make sure the equipment is clean before you arrive by using a very pleasant non-toxic almost aroma therapeutic type product, must be home made. They also play perfect fun music tailored to every workout and then calming songs when you are cooling down. I look forward to all of my class and can't wait to share this hidden gem with my friends! Love pulse fitness, can't say enough positive things about it! : )",

The staff is always really friendly and willing to help with whatever you need and the routes are changed pretty frequently.  \n\nThe bathrooms are pretty smelly but I am not there for the bathroom anyway.\n\nI don't use it very often but there is also a bouldering area upstairs.",

The showers recently got a makeover and although I don't use them, they look a lot better than they used to.  There is limited space for more equipment so sometimes you do have to wait for the equipment you want to use (specifically the squat racks since they only have two).  \n\nThey have a big pool, child sitting services, showers, a media room with a big projection screen to watch movies while you run, and personal trainers always willing to help.

They offer lots of different classes and opportunities for fitness. My oldest took swimming lessons here for five years and my youngest just started.\n\nCons: Theft is extremely common here, both vehicular and also belongings in the locker room. Thieves do target the rich careless people who frequent this place and leave valuables out. Use common sense and lock up your stuff. Registering for classes is difficult. The website is difficult to use and not streamlined for easy use. It's also hard to figure out how to use everything else. The people who work there seem bored. My main complaint is our most recent swim class. My youngest is 24 months and just had her first swim lesson. The teacher strongly pressured me to dunk her under the water. I didn't care for that at all. She also literally pulled a child away from her grandparent and dunked her. I thought she was not gentle at all physically or personality-wise and hope the class gets better.\n\n\nAll in all, great facility but confusing rules and pressure on parents to dunk kids even if they're not ready. What's the rush?",

  "text": "Santa Barbara Athletic Club is a gym in Santa Barbara that tries to tailor itself to the higher profile clientele. I feel as though it's trying to be a fitness club rather than a gym and unfortunately everything is outdated and everything feels old.\n\nThis gym seems outdated, equipment seems old, everything seems old and needs to be updated. It feels like a gym that was operating once ten years ago.\n\nThey offer a pool to swim in that you can do laps in but it's nowhere near an Olympian Pool. It's a nice pool though where kids aren't actually peeing in it unlike most of the pools nearby. They have squash courts which is one of the standout features due to the fact that there are not many squash courts in Santa Barbara (other than the ones at UCSB which can only be used by Alumni members). But I honestly don't have anything nice to say about this facility.\n\nOverall, it's very old, it smells old, it feels old, and even the staff seem very old. I wouldn't recommend this place, in fact I am cancelling my membership for these reasons, I had only been a member for three months, and I never felt more judged by a facility than here. I was paying $150 every month and each time I came in to sign in I felt that no one wanted me there unless I bought a class with one of their trainers. Good news was that they waived my $100 cancellation fee, but other than that, they need a serious renovation on their staff.",

  "text": "THE GYM\n\nThe facility is decent. I believe the gym was remodeled a couple of years back, though it makes me wonder what the place looked like before. From what I heard, LA Fitness tends to clean the equipment often, compared to 24 Hour Fitness (not that any exist in Arizona). We see the staff cleaning the equipment, mirrors, and floor each evening. \n\nThe saunas are located in the restroom, showers have curtains and there is one handheld blow dryer is located towards the end of the locker room. It's not very glamorous compared to the university gym I've used in the past, but I guess it gets the job done. And there are free mini-lockers (where you enter in a code) located outside the locker room, if you need to store small things, like your wallet and keys.\n\nThey have a 4 lane pool and small hot tub. Sufficient treadmills and ellipticals, but I can't promise anything on Mondays --I'm not sure how everyone seems to gain the motivation to get to the gym at the beginning of the week. Then again, maybe it was because the nearest LA Fitness was under construction.\n\nThere are several racquet ball rooms (personally, I wished badminton or tennis was an option). The gym has one basketball court, another room for stretches, a cycling room and another for classes. There is a childcare area, I'm not sure about the specifics, but I believe it comes at an additional price. \n\nAs for the people at the gym, it's fairly diverse in regards to ethnicity, age, and physical fitness. There are classes like Zumba and aquatic aerobics. I would imagine the schedule is posted online. \n\nTHE STAFF\n\nThe bad: I am often wary about gyms as I am at car dealerships. My first experience here, 6 months prior, was with a stereotypical and superficial employee, trying to shove a gym membership down my throat, despite having stated multiple times that I only wanted to try the free trial for now and I wasn't ready to commit to a gym membership yet. \n\nAlternatively, the person who signed my brother up for a trial felt it was appropriate to show off a photo of himself with abs. Weird flex, but okay. I'm happy to say I think that both guys have moved on to a different facility. (:\n\nThe decent: The staff at the front will usually say \"hi\" or \"bye.\" I realized this doesn't always happen since half the time, people walk past without responding. I haven't had any extended interaction with them, but the staff seems pretty alright to me.\n\nThe good: Mike is a new-ish general manager and he's definitely your go-to guy, if you have any questions or concerns. Mike is the most personable gym manager I've met and I appreciated his small gestures of encouragement when I revealed my couch potato life. I've also seen gym members discussing concerns with Mike in a friendly manner, so it appears that he is approachable and does a good job resolving issues.\n\nSo after my 6-month hiatus fo the gym, I returned for another trial and was pleasantly surprised with Mike his genuine and respectful demeanor. When it was time to sign-up, he informed me of a deal that came up in February. It was truly a great option for someone who is committed to visit the gym consistently, which I can't say that I am.\n\nI want to commend Mike's integrity in providing an honest recommendation to help me determine which membership was the best fit (rather than his or the company's bottom line). I feel that the trust he developed is more than what money can buy. Mike's there most evenings if you need a tour!",

But, they're also super modifiable, so they're great for all levels. The \"days\" rotate on a 3 day basis (legs one day then arms then core then legs again). And guys, I had to slowly inch down the stairs after class. \n\nPlus, I think the best part is the instructor and environment. The class felt so energetic, and everyone was so nice.

They are always there to help rookie climbers, and offer tips to the people who have been climbing for a while.  Regardless if you are renting your equipment from them, or bringing in your own, the staff will treat you with the same respect and courtesy as anyone else.  It is a rare event to see on of the staff without a smile on their face.  \n\nAs good as the staff is, the walls are even better.  Rocks and Ropes offers a variety of climbing options for every skill level.  They have flat walls, inclined walls, and simulated rock face walls.  They offer belaying more than one type of belaying, including multiple auto-belayers for those without a partner.  They also have a Free standing boulder, and a secondary bouldering room upstairs. \n\nThey also have a small area upstairs for parties, a store to buy your own rock climbing gear, and showers available for those who might need to head somewhere after working out.

I have heard my wife and other women complain that the management won't do anything about loud mouthed, vulgar, sexist and lecherous behavior from the men even if they are told about it again and again.\n\nCasey is the only fantastic guy still employed there. He is always positive, helpful and knowledgeable. I did have a few really good personal trainers that have since quit. I have seen other trainers leading new people through movements with bad form that could be (or were) injurious. I even told a trainer I was rehabilitating a knee injury and one of the first exercises he wanted to do actually set my healing back a week. It wasn't unusual to observe male trainers blandly counting reps for one of their clients while checking out women or their phones. \n\nThe people that will enjoy this location are people that already know how to work out and women that know \"men will be boys\" and don't expect the staff will look out for them let alone enforce the club rules and etiquette.",

  "text": "There were many a hiccup with the opening of Crunch so I waited a bit to write this review, as I wanted it to be fair.\nThe facility is brand spanking new and chockfull of machines, weights, punching bags, etc.  Unfortunately one of the first noticeable things is the smell of new equipment (almost like tires), but of course, that will fade.  There is more than ample equipment and most of the machines have some sort of instruction.  Which is great for me, since I am sort of clueless with all of this stuff.  The treadmills even have fans built into them, wow, I didn't know that was a thing.\n\nI specifically joined for the classes.   I have taken 5 at this point, one of them spin and the others were in the workout room (not HIT ZONE).  I was impressed with the spin bikes, not necessarily the class.  I found the instructor to be more \"inspirational\" than instructive.  The Absolution class was fun and the instructor was great at breaking down the exercises.  I will say that the 30-minute classes feel more like a warm-up and not a full workout.  Although, I have seen 45-minute classes on the schedule.  Because the intensity isn't as high as I am used to I was able to do a bunch of classes back to back and that was fun.  I really like that the weights are color-coded too!  \n\nMy FAVORITE thing though isn't any of the workouts or equipment, it's the Hydro Massage table.  It's included in the Peak membership and it is a god-send! Ten minutes on that table and I am ready to face the world! 100% worth the price of admission. \n\nThe staff is friendly, I guess.  You're screwed if you need any help beyond basic instruction.  If you have an issue with the website or the app you are pretty much on your own.  You can try e-mailing them but getting a response is hit or miss.   \n\nThe locker rooms are ample, and they have showers which are hard to find at Reno gyms.  All in all this place is totally worth $30/month.",

  "text": "An easy catch up for a novice barre newbie but challenging enough for an advanced nimble nymph, Allong√©e is a workout studio for all levels! When I used to have ClassPass (and back in the day when the studio was located on 2nd street in Old city), Allong√©e was my definite go-to for ultimate sweat and fun. The workouts are definitely intense, you sweat buckets, and I felt stronger (and more flexible) with every class I took. Allong√©e is owned by Jillian who is a rockstar. She's hardcore with her pretty ballerina past but she knows just how to push you and get your muscles burning. She's extremely knowledgeable about body mechanics which in turn means highly efficient and effective workouts to sculpt your body and get your cardio going. The studio was always clean, the music high energy, and the class vibe cool and welcoming. Class prices are pricey but nothing different from any other city studio class. With all my work schedule conflicts, continuing ClassPass didn't make sense financially but if I did I would definitely recommend anyone to try out Allong√©e!",

  "text": "This place has potential but feels so disorganized. A few months ago, I bought a Groupon for classes here. I called with some questions and left a message, but no one ever got back to me. The Groupon voucher said it was good for specialty or regular classes. I went on a Sunday and was told it wasn't good for Sunday classes because they are drop-in classes. Not sure how I could have known this since the voucher didn't say Sunday classes were excluded... The Groupon was expiring soon and so I really wanted to redeem the voucher, and they finally agreed to let me use it for that day. \n\nLast night I signed up and paid for zumba class this morning and dragged myself out of bed only to discover the class was cancelled because they have special workshops today. I've been assured I'll get a refund, but come on - the class should have been cancelled in the system! \n\nOn the other hand...the classes are a lot of fun. I've mainly attended Peter's zumba class and love it! He is so upbeat and energetic - his class is a great way to start off my Saturday morning. I've also attended a class called Pound that uses special drumsticks, and it was a lot of fun. The prices are very reasonable as well. If you decide to go, be sure to bring your own water - oddly enough there isn't a water fountain, at least not that I've seen.",

Clearly a lot of people in there climbing know each other and are members, so I expected to get the brush off since we had no idea what we were doing. Not at all the case. We got a 30 minute lesson so that my husband could learn how to belay our kids. Then you are set free to do whatever you want in the gym. It was great that they could do any course they wanted over and over. The courses are numbered so you could see the difficulty, but you can just try them all if you want.\n\nIt was not cheap--$60 for my husband and 2 kids (would have been $100 if I had done it too), and my husband could not even climb--he could only belay. But it was worth it for my kids to get a taste of climbing. On a hot day, it was really fun and my kids were EXHAUSTED afterward. Can't wait for the birthday party.",

There are lots of treadmills, ellipticals, & stationary bicycles available with many flat screen tvs to watch while sweating calories away.\n\nHours are good, but I'd prefer a 24 hour gym.  \n\nIf you like racquetball, there are numerous courts!  There is also a basketball court that is usually free during the day.  In the evenings, there are usually people playing b-ball games.  \n\nI do wish they had more types of classes.  LA Fitness in other cities have belly dancing, Yogabeat, Hip hop, & Cardio Jam classes that seem fun to try.",

The locker rooms were clean, bright and plenty of lighting for dressing for activities once you leave the gym.  Although nice the locker room was relatively small in comparison to the facility size.  Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I was Disappointed that the steam room / sauna are coed and the lack of diverse group Exercise classes.  Not sure if it would be worth the drive from the Lebanon area (this closest) at this time.",

  "text": "Rock and ropes is probably this biggest indoor rock climbing center I've been to. They offer military discount on Monday and Friday but don't forget to check in on yelp! Since you can get 50% off their rental equipment, dope right? This is the first place that has ever offered that. You get shoes and the harness as the equipment that you'll be renting. The staff was friendly, they taught us how to put on the harness and how to use the automatic belaying rope. \n\nThey have many routes that you can climb on the wall or on the boulders. If you go upstairs they also have a place where you could free climb and it can get tricky with the angle of the wall. I'm still a amateur at this but I will be back to go at it again. The automatic belaying was helpful because if you go by yourself or with friends that are new to this sport, you don't have to worry about falling. Once you let go, it would catch you and slowly lowering it back down to the floor.\n\nOh yeah I forgot to say that military members also get a sweet deal on their membership. I can't recall the benefits for joining their membership but why don't you come in with some friends and try out rock climbing! Hey, you might just become a member!",

Whatevs, I'm an adult and I realize that I should try to stay in shape, especially if I insist on eating like a garbage can.\n\nSo I end up at City Fitness 2 or 3 times a week. This is a cheap gym, with no contract requirements and modern equipment. It's a fine place to work out, especially if you are on a tight budget and have a schedule where you can work out during the day. \n\nIt's really overcrowded during peak hours. Don't even think about going at 5:30. There is not enough room to stretch, you have to wait for weights and machines, classes are packed past capacity. After 8pm it's much more tolerable. Eh.

  "text": "I am at this Planet Fitness location several times a week, and after my 5 am-ish workout there this morning, I knew my review needed to be updated. I've been checking out some other Planet Fitness locations when I travel, and this location just doesn't measure up. My biggest complaint? Broken equipment is not quickly fixed. Over a month ago (maybe more than two months ago), one of only four Stairmasters was marked as out of order. That Stairmaster still hasn't been fixed. About two weeks ago, another of the four Stairmasters was mas marked as out of order. Now we're down to two. And I have no confidence they will be fixed in the near future or at all (it has occurred to me that perhaps they are waiting for them all to break before just replacing all four?). These are popular machines. It was hard for me to get some time on one of them when there were four! But now that the gym is down to two, I haven't been able to get on one in AGES. This is really frustrating for me. Beyond that, the bathrooms at this location are always pretty messy - something I thought was pretty standard until I started visiting other locations. The customer service at the desk is fine. The gym has the other equipment you'd expect (many of the machines were very recently replaced as well), but I've been extremely frustrated by their inability to have equipment fixed quickly.",

  "text": "As long as Shareen is there I will not recommend anyone to go there. I recently found out a camp was opened in Clearwater so I immediately told my friends and family about it. My brother called the camp and he had such a horrible experience. He called asking about the 20lb 6 week challenge and spoke with Shareen. She immediately asked how much he weighs and was so rude about it. She was annoyed by his questions and kept telling him to come into orientation and everything will be explained there. He is 5'11\" and 280lbs (Large built police officer). She said that he doesn't qualify for that promo and he needs to do 4 challenges (lose 80lbs) to see a transformation because 20lbs is nothing in his case. And then If he lost 80lbs with them then he can get his money back. A majority of the people come to the camp because they are over weight. Putting them down and making them feel that unless they lose 80lbs that it's not a transformation and how 20lbs is nothing compared to 280lbs is not how you gain loyal clients or even a new client. I'm sorry but that is very misleading and not how other camps work. She proceeded to say how it's just a marketing scheme to get people to become members (who says that?!). It hurts me that they would say that to my own brother when I'm here trying to get everyone I know healthy and introducing them to this gym. I called myself and Shareen answered; she was very pushy and rude. I called myself to get some basic info to see how she really was and turns out she's worse then he described. I'm a member at the camp on the west coast and have referred a lot of people that purchased memberships and completed challenges. At that location everyone is friendly and sensitive when it comes to someone's weight. Sadly, I re-told all my family and friends not to go there bc I don't appreciate how they treat people and don't want anymore of them getting disrespected and put down. A few of them found a similar program at a cross fit and are happy and comfortable there. Idk if Sam (the CEO) knows how badly this location is being run and ruining the reputation of the camp but I sure will bring it to his attention.",

  "text": "Terrible LA Fitness. Without a doubt the worst I've ever been to. 1.) it's so crowded, not because of the amount of people there, but the gym is TINY. All of the equipment is like a foot apart from each other. It's an accident waiting to happen. 2.) No amenities: no basketball court, no swimming pool, small locker rooms and less equipment than other, far better LA Fitness, like the one on 22nd. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this crappy LA Fitness. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because a 1 would be horrific equipment, and the equipment here is just passable. Still sucks though.",

  "text": "Planet Fitness does the job. Is it perfect? No. (No pool, track, steam or sauna,  limited free weights, unwatchable TVs , weird with the rules, no grunting, dropping of weights etc.) Bottom line, 10 bucks a month, if you just use this facility. Can't beat that! That's like nothing and the contracts aren't a hassle to get out of I heard.  If you are seriously a fitness freak, or body builder the selection here might not be enough, but for the average Joe like me, place is fine for keeping tone and in shape, and again the best bang for your buck. Plenty of newer cardio machines,good air ventilation with the large over head fans. Place is clean, bathrooms and locker, shower area are small but again clean. Never really crowded (at least the times I have gone) Ample parking lot plenty of spaces. Open 24 hours are a big plus for the guy or gal that likes to work out off hours. Now if i can just get my ass over there?!",

  "text": "Let's get physical physical at the Saint Louis Fitness Club. I only wish they had one in California. I don't mean to whine and complain but Los Angeles is notorious for overpriced and crazy packed gyms, there's no such thing as a deal in Cali. The bottom line is if you want a gym that's spacious, safe, clean, not crowded and has excellent customer service you literally have to pay $100 if you pay anything less in CA you're looking at a nightmare... My girlfriend and I went in and tried the 7 day membership. Upon entering we were greeted by a sales rep who helped get us ready. She gave us a brief tour of the gym and answered all our questions. The gym is located in a nice safe area. There seems to be an abundance of parking all over. To enter the gym you need a security key or press the buzzer. All the equipment appeared to be name brands and in excellent condition, all relevant and expensive. I loved the layout, everything had a place. My friend and I utilized the yoga room where we stretched, practiced HIIT, jump roped, weights and steps. \n\nOverall a fresh and super nice facility with all the right tools, great attitudes and thoughtful amenities such as a free child care room. The restrooms and locker rooms are rather clean too. I recommend this gym to anyone who is looking to improve their mind body and soul. Oh ya, the cost is super reasonable, I'm sad I can't live here full time and have this be my full time gym. It is the gym of my dreams.",

During my second class, I was much stronger and my resistance was much higher. I'm so happy I gave it a shot and continued taking classes through out my trip. I ate so much food in Philadelphia, but came back home to FL tiny thanks to BC. The equipment is new and the facility is very clean. All of the instructors have their own style and motivate you. If you're a beginner, don't worry, you can go at your own pace. Also, speak up and ask for help to set up your bike. You want to be comfortable, but most of all, the instructors want you comfortable with proper form.",

There sales manager goes over some options with me.  After he offers me a few options, all of which are more expensive than what if offered on-line; I let him know that I'm on a computer and why would I take any of those options, when they are more?  He tells me that I could also sign up for those.  He then asks me if I would be so kind as to put his promotional code as he would get credit. Being in sales myself I agree.  He runs me through the process and again tries to get me to sign up for the more expensive, worse options.  \n\nI finally hang up, start over, do not give him any credit, and get the best price online.  \nSkip yourself the head ache of dealing with these meat heads.

It was a bit of a drive for me so I wasn't sure if I would come again but it was definitely worth it. The only critique I have is that it was missing some of that 'family' feel some gym classes have where the instructor will call you out by name or speak to you directly especially if you're not pushing yourself hard enough. Maybe some ppl don't like that or it's just Bc it was the 5am class but that helps me get through my workout when we push each other or the instructor calls me out",

It was totally ineffective and all I was doing was gaining weight.\n\n  At F3, I have my choice of challenging classes that deliver real results. While the courses are difficult, virtually all exercises can be modified to one's fitness level. Another great aspect of F3 is that clients run the gamut from struggling with fitness to professional athletes looking for a further leg up on the competition. The instructors and trainers are excellent and the facility is very nice as well. F3 has many pieces of equipment that I didn't even know existed. I could not recommend F3 anymore strongly and hope to be a per annum member with unlimited access for MANY years to come!",

  "text": "This Planet Fitness is definitely the best one in the greater New Orleans area.\n\nPlanet Fitness is an elusive corporate gym. Everything is nice and shiny, themed purple and yellow. Plus for $10 to $20 a month, not including down payment and annual fee, it's pretty hard to say no. Throw in pizza on first Mondays and bagels on second Tuesdays... I try to avoid those days, but if I paid for it, I might grab a slice or five.\n\nLet's start with Planet Fitness' basics. They have plenty of cardio machines: treadmills, bicycles, arc trainers. There is a free weight area with dumbbells and fixed barbells. There are smith machines and other machines to target muscles.There are pulley systems for your pulldowns, rows, etc. \n\nPlanet Fitness exclusive areas include 8 minute abs and 30 minute (full body) workout. There is also a Blackcard area (the aforementioned $20 membership) with hydro massage beds and massage chairs, tanning rooms, and total body enhancement rooms (whatever that is). There is also a \"Lunk Alarm\" that they sound whenever someone is dropping weights and or grunting too loudly. There is also a dress code of no string tank tops (body builder tops). That sounds harsh but with their mantra of \"No Gymtimidation,\" it is nice to have a semi quiet workout without someone dropping their 15's. Just saying.\n\nNow let's get on to what makes this location unique and why I choose this one out of all of them. PF 360. It's like a jungle gym for gym rats. A couple pulleys, medicine balls, plylo boxes, kettlebells, a circuit rope, resistance bands, a Bosu ball and my personal favorite: TRX straps. There are also 4 stair climbers and a newly installed fountain specifically for water bottles. Decently sized stretch area with two stretching cages, plenty of mats, stability balls, and abductor/adductor machines. There are TV's but I normally don't watch them since they're so far from the treadmills. There are also changing rooms, showers, blow dryers, and pretty fancy lockers.\n\nOf course, there are cons. The parking lot is also for houses Dollar Tree customers (and right now since it's close to Halloween, Spirit Store) so in peak hours it's hard to find a spot. This place is always packed though. I don't think it calms down until 11PM. Metairie is full of people on the go so that doesn't surprise me. This location also lacks full body mirrors [edit: in the locker room]. That sounds vain, but people like to see their progress head to toe, not just from the torso up! It also lacks a scale, but I've only seen that in a Houston location. Dumbbells stop at 70 and fixed weights stop at 60. There are no free barbells, squat rack, or deadlift area. And the giant fans! Can you say cotton mouth? If you want to avoid it there's always spots where it doesn't hit you.\n\nIf you want to stay fit for the low, I'd definitely come here. I've also seen some body builders get creative here as well, so I wouldn't spun the place!",

  "text": "The remodel looks great. Less carpet, upgraded and more equipment. The arrangement can use some change because the cable equipment is far too close for comfort. Turn around to do some fly's and you might be kissing someone's face or ass, depending on what exercise they are doing. \nSome of the plate loading equipment have been shuffled around out of order of the muscle group you are targeting. I guess that is petty, but it has some of us scratching our heads. \nOtherwise, I can say that it is a nice facility and I missed it when they were renovating it.\n\nI do have issues with their preacher benches, you can't adjust the height on them.\nAlso the new bench presses. The hooks need to go. Makes it harder to re-rack the bar. Caught a couple people, including myself trying to get over the hook after sets and have to set it on the hook below or worse case- have the bar come down on your grill.\n\nThe worse part about being a member of this gym or any gym in that matter, some of the people go just to socialize. There are a selective handful of people who spend more time talking and getting in the way than working out. Go to a Starbucks and talk. Go outside. Go away. The same people also don't know how to re-rack the weights. I made it clear one day with one dude. I waited until a young lady goes over to the incline bench to re-rack the weights he used over a half hour ago. I went over to her and said, \"No, don't put those back for him, hold on.\" I yell over at him across the gym, \"Hey! you using this still?!\" He goes, \"Oh I was still using it.\" Yah, whatever dude. No you weren't you tool. It was sitting there unattended while you were on a machine elsewhere talking to the staff member that is part of your little gossip circle jerk. Do us all a favor and start using the gym as what it is there for and maybe then, just maybe you will look like you actually workout. Save your time trying to pick up women for the club or bar.",

  "text": "When War Horse first opened in the neighborhood, I (wrongly) assumed that it was the type of place that you wouldn't dare to set foot into unless you were already really into lifting and knew what you were doing. I completely dismissed it until I noticed that one of my coworkers had gone and I figured if she can do it, why not me?  I've always exercised, but my regimen of cardio + Bikram yoga wasn't doing much for my limp noodle arms, so I finally decided to go and check out War Horse.\n\nYou get to attend 3 complimentary Ignite classes before you to commit to joining or not.  During those first classes, Jaclyn (co-owner) pretty much stays by your side to show you what to do, and she and Chris (trainer/co-owner) modify the moves for you based on your strength and fitness level.  It's a great introduction into the Ignite classes while still having guidance (and trust me, you will need that guidance).  \n\nNow that I've joined, I still need help, direction, and modifications to a lot of the moves. Chris and Jaclyn are patient and helpful and the other members are encouraging.  If you're worried that you'll be the only girl there, don't be.  There's a good mix of both men and women in the classes.  If you're not strong or haven't really worked out before, don't worry about that either.  A lot of people who go to War Horse hadn't ever really lifted before joining. Also once you join, you get 3 complimentary 1 on 1 training sessions.  I haven't taken advantage of that yet since I'm still deciding what I need the most help with, but I'm glad I have the option.",

A few reasons why I never went back to the studio. 1) Price: my student budget cannot afford $30/class and there's no student discount; this was the biggest issue. 2) Distance: this place is so far away from where I live and not even on my route home from school; I'd just have to go too far out of the way to do it and I'm not sure that I'm disciplined to do it. 3) Contact: after the first class I wanted to try a few more and there was a 5 for $125 deal for first timers; I emailed back and forth with the studio manager and at the end of the conversation asked to purchase the package, but never heard back from her. I even called a few times to get the purchase done and heard nothing. Honestly, despite the other two reasons, I was willing to give it a try but since I never heard back I just figured it wasn't meant to be. \n\nI think studios like this are great - the reformer is an insane machine to workout on but it gets the results that you might be looking for so if you're willing to splurge, I highly recommend trying at least one class. Hopefully your experiences getting the new student discount will be better than mine!",

  "text": "Wanted to swing by here and write a five-star, raving review for these guys.  Sparing you all the lengthy details about how I -- a female with no martial arts training -- ended up taking jiu-jitsu classes, I'll say it became important to have a set of practical self-defense skills in my toolbox. \n\nBecause of that, this might not be a useful review for people who DO have tons of training experience/opinions on martial arts and all that.  But if you're a n00b and you want to know if this place is the place to check out, read on.\n\nSo, naturally, because I wasn't raging to wrestle...well...anybody, I was really nervous to take these classes. I disclosed this to Sean and a handful of the coaches/athletes at the gym, and I was BEYOND warmly welcomed. They went out of their way to help me feel comfortable, to help me practice the basics, to laugh at me when I did ridiculous things, and to encourage me to keep coming. I would always go into class anxious, and I would always leave with a sense of being glad I'd gone. \n\nThe athletes train hard, and it shows in their overall fitness and performance. Warmups included drills and rolls and pushups and situps and pullups and you name it. It's sort of sad to realize that you're an adult and you have the most awkward forward roll on the planet...but you'll get better. You can't help but get better with these guys and everybody has a story about how awkward they were when they first started, and they'll share it with you if you look freaked out enough (which I think I must have). \n\nA word on cleanliness, in case any gals reading this are wary: aside from a general smell of sweat, I was never grossed out by anything in the facility. The women's locker room was NICE and CLEAN and SPACIOUS and smelled good. The mats were in good condition and there was a lot of room to spread out in the event that a super-sweaty guy left a puddle somewhere that you wanted to avoid. \n\nAlso, there were girls in the classes! I tried to convince myself that I was the only girl and that that was a reason to not show up to class but every single time I did, there were a handful of other girls there -- young and old, experienced and inexperienced.\n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is that this studio has a reputation for training exceptional athletes but that does not, in any way, make it inaccessible to newcomers of varying age, gender, fitness level or intention.  You show up, you don't quit, and you progress alongside a group of people who treat you like family.  You can't go wrong with that.",

After touring a few other gyms, this was my choice for multiple reasons: it looks absolutely clean and everyone is always cleaning after they work out, the staff is SO friendly and helpful, there are options for a variety of classes (boxing, kickboxing, HIIT), it is not crowded at all (unless you go at 5/5:30, it gets a little busy), there is a no disrespect policy so everyone feels comfortable doing their own thing. At $69/ month ($79 for non-students) this is one of the best deals I found for all that is included (also an option to pay less to just use the gym without classes). The equipment is relatively new and good quality. An extra bonus: the music is usually great!",

The atmosphere, community, and workouts are all fantastic. \n\nThere are several options of membership but I'm on the 6 months unlimited classes. Considering I go 5-6 times a week, it is well worth it!! There's a great range of classes for strength training, and my go-tos are TRX, CardioStrong, and Lift. The trainers are great, and with their upcoming move to a new location, more trainers are in the works. \n\nThis is a women's only gym so you never feel judged or uncomfortable, and since everyone's ages and fitness levels range, everyone is incredibly supportive. People are friendly and will always encourage you!\n\nMy personal fitness level has drastically improved, with small changes like increased flexibility, to big changes like more energy during workouts and way more strength.\n\nThis is the best decision I've made in years, and I truly encourage you to check out Dragonfly, you won't regret it!",

  "text": "The good first:\nSo as far as the facility goes, there are a LOT of things offered here that you won't find at other gyms. This place is brimming with stuff to do in terms of exercise. There is an indoor pool open year-round, an outdoor pool open for 6 months out of the year, several different workout zones, a basketball court, classes that come with the membership including aqua exercise classes, Zumba, pilates, yoga, insanity, and more, even including some nutrition classes! There is even a caf√© here. There is also a very updated section of the gym with advanced machines (\"Technofit\"). These machines store all your workout info on the cloud when you put your key in or sign into the cloud through their app. The women's locker room is also very clean and includes a sauna and a steam room. For this locker room, you do not need to bring a lock in; the lockers have keypad locks on them. The women's showers are very clean and complimentary soap, shampoo, conditioner, and razors are provided. Throughout the locker room are also hairdryers.\n\nAdmittedly, they also intentionally or unintentionally provide a LOT of motivation to work out! If you're in certain age groups, you might get a free heart rate monitor that shows your heart rate while you are working out on the little TV screens they have throughout the gym. This is definitely helpful when working out. And although it's not an expensive product, it is apparently \"free\" if you meet certain goals for 3 months, which gives you enough reason to want to go to the gym and meet the required goals!\n\nThe bad:\nThe prices are only good if you're within a certain age group. I am in the youngest age group so the prices are reasonable at $52-$62 monthly. As you get older, the prices get worse, and they are terrible for those in what I think is the 32-64 age bracket, at $141+ a month and a several hundred dollar enrollment fee on top of that. So I would definitely recommend this athletic center to people within the 10-24 age bracket if you're worried about costs (and let's be honest, who isn't?)\n\nSecondly, the caf√© food I thought was pretty good until a few hours after eating it. Yesterday I tried the power up skillet with quinoa, an egg, sausage, peppers, and mushrooms, and I was in severe gastrointestinal distress for the entire day, to the point where I almost went home from work. I used the bathroom 4-5 times and felt horrible in between each time. Today as well, I tried it again to confirm that it was definitely that food that caused it, and I kid you not, I am on the toilet writing this right now and have not been feeling well. This is an extremely rare occurrence for me and didn't happen on the days I didn't try the food, so I'm left to believe that it was the food that caused this. I won't be trying most of their food again. Perhaps a smoothie in the future but even that I can't be sure of as of right now, as my stomach kills me.\n\nNext, anything outside of what's provided with the basic membership (which is plenty enough) is a waste of money or a luxury for those who can afford it. Most of the extras are incredibly expensive. For instance, I saw swimming lessons (not aquatic exercise) at $60 for a 50 minute class with several other people. Not even individual lessons! I myself don't even make $10+ every ten minutes, so I find it hard to pay that much to someone else, especially if the lessons are individual lessons.\n\nAnd finally, they make it impossibly difficult to get out of their contract without spending a lot of money unless you become basically disabled during the contract period. But I guess that's anywhere, right?\n\nTL;DR: This place is awesome at the 10-24 year-old rates, given all that it offers. Stick to the basics!",

  "text": "So I just moved to Tampa Fl, so I am in search of the right crunch fitness gym for me.  I started with this location because they had a 9am spin class on Sunday. And its not for me.  If you live in downtown Tampa then this might be the gym for you.  The commute on Sunday morning was not bad but I can see where it would be awful during the week.  Parking is different.  They have  a garage right next to them that technically are for the residents of the complex.  You are allowed to use the 3rd, 4th and 5th level for no more then two hours. The garage ticket does not need to be validated, you simple scan the ticket on your way out.  The gym itself is very well maintained.  Keep in mind that I have frequented several northern NJ Crunch in my life time.  The word that comes to mind with this gym is cold and sterile.  I don't mean sterile as in clean but more as a setting.  There is nothing friendly about this gym. Reminds me of the planet fitness commercial with the big bulky guys walking around looking at them selfs.  Definitely not for me.  On to check out the next crunch.",

The prior owner treated me very well even though I did not make my challenge weight. She agreed to take the amount of pounds that I lost multiplied by $10 and roll that into a monthly membership. \n\nBut when I came back in to utilize my credit on account, I told the new manager, \"I have one month of credit on account here that I would like to use up.\" First words out of her mouth were, \"That's not how we do things here, let's go to my office.\" \n\nIt was obvious that it was under new ownership. Shirene was unbelievably rude when I was trying to explain to her what I was offered. She could not wait to jump at the chance to cut me off to say that I was wrong and proceed to explain that this wasn't the way things are done. \n\nI could barely complete a sentence with out Shirene cutting me off to say why what I was saying was incorrect. I was so pissed that she never even let me finish speaking!\n\nShe tried to make me pay for an entire year to in order to acquire my credit. There are VERY few places that I've stormed out of, but this one is on my list. \n\nI even stopped a moment while I was leaving to tell her that if the prior OWNER of this establishment has offered a customer (ME) something, that she should AT THE VERY LEAST be willing to listen to what was offered. \n\nShirene should be demoted until she's been retrained in customer service.",

  "text": "In my opinion Sporting Club could be one of the better gyms of center city in terms of location and offerings, however it all comes at a price. \n\nI paid $100 a month for this exclusive location and was mostly satisfied with the hours of operation and offerings vs. other gyms in the area.  I liked where it was situated. I mostly liked being a member of this gym, however the basketball court and pool often have a waiting time.  I wished to have bigger space available on each to meet the high demand, but they only had about five lanes in the pool, one or two of which was occasionally blocked off for private lessons.  The fitness area, though, is more than sufficient enough in size, and there are numerous personal TV screens available with about 20 channels to surf through with headphone audio at many a bike or treadmill.  Some of the bikes come with instrumental music built in, or you can just dock your ipod which is what most people do. \n\nI complied correctly with their paid notice for 30 days cancellation policy, but I was still terminated earlier than expected due to an error by the membership office.  The staff here is extremely friendly and helpful and sorted out that problem I experienced, and I was soon reinstated for just the 3 remaining weeks for which I had already been under contract.  Another time I locked my keys in my own locker and one of the staff leant me a company t-shirt and a pair of flips so that I could go back to my office to retrieve my spare key.  What a great gesture!\n\nOverall, I give this place great credibility and would recommend it, with a few reservations. With the price tag of about $1,200 a year, I couldn't justify continuing to spend this kind of money. It would be a lock if I could have gotten my employer to subsidize part of it for its health benefits, or offer payroll deductions/discounts, which some area employers now do in the interest of employee health and morale.   Unfortunately, because my employer did not participate in the direct discount program, I was denied a discount even though it was available to other employees in my building whose status was full time instead of contracted.  I wish Sporting Club had made an exception for me, since the only reason I enrolled in the first place was because of my client's advertising to all employees on the site in which I was being paid. Since they wouldn't honor it, I found Sporting Club to be generally unaccommodating and I didn't stay with them after switching jobs, to a place that was willing to offer a better deal through such payroll deductions from my new employer. One other area of disappointment was when this proprietor allegedly terminated the contract of an independently run juice bar that was doing so well to make their otherwise ordinary lobby seem like a relaxing lounge.",

  "text": "Really unique, fun and challenging experience. I am not a big cycle fan and I enjoyed this ride! It's like a party, but you're working out. They provide shoes, lockers, towels, water and everything is linked back to your name. You just show up and the shoes are waiting in your assigned cubby, and your name is programmed in the system so that you can see your stats on the screen in the workout room. They even email you a recap of your workout. The girls working helped me to my bike and showed me how to adjust the height and insert the shoes.",

  "text": "My visit was more of a tour than a tryout of any of the spa services, fitness facilities or group exercise classes but it was impressive enough to make me want to go back for any or all of those experiences. \n\nThe entrance faces the parking lot which makes it easy and convenient to park and arrive without having to trudge through International Plaza in your workout gear of before your spa transformation. \n\nThe interior is much more polished than typical workout places and exudes a really high-end feel. The yoga room featured subdued lighting, a clean scent of eucalyptus and was pleasantly warm. I could easily imagine slipping into a relaxed state instantly upon entering and really immersing myself into the poses. \n\nImmersion is the word that kept coming to mind as I walked through the spa area that offers treatments and touch-ups for skin, nails and hair. The facial and massage rooms offered a relaxing, peaceful retreat from the bright lights, sights and sounds of the rest of the facility. If no one is getting rubbed or scrubbed, I could be tempted to slip into one of the rooms for a nap. They were that inviting!\n\nIndoor cycling is a passion of mine and the cycling room was luxuriously large and the bikes looked like they could provide a top-of-the-line ride. As a former pilates student, I checked out the room full of reformers with envy. \n\nThe cafe is quite inviting and the menu of breakfast foods, shakes and smoothies, salads, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas and was really appetizing. There is even a LifeCafe D.Tox menu to help get your body back on a more healthful and nutritional track.\n\nThe LifeSpa and LifeCafe are both open to the public and not limited only to members. So even if fitness is not an interest or you already have a favorite spot to enjoy exercise, you can still enjoy this resort-like experience and treat yourself to a treatment or something good to eat.",

The toilet paper and paper towels are always out, and you can actually see the mildew buildup on the bathroom counters... SO gross!! I would be willing to bet a lot of money that the bathrooms aren't even getting cleaned weekly, when it should be daily. Really really disgusting. There have been a lot of new members since the beginning of the year, and we've been noticing that none of the newbies wipe down their equipment or put their weights away, which is frustrating. Today I watched a female trainer \"training\" (improperly by the way) a client, and afterward they just left the barbell on the preacher curl bench and walked away... shouldn't she have been teaching this new gym goer the proper gym etiquette? \nIf you go upstairs, the whole upstairs just stinks like mold and sweat. The whole place needs a serious deep cleaning. The new YMCA opens soon, and it will be interesting to see how well Axiom does.",

They greet you as you enter the door and say goodbye as you leave! This gym doesn't have a ton of equipment, but it has enough for a gym. There's an elliptical, plenty of treadmills, bikes, and different types of weights. Their locker room is super clean. there's a few different sections to the gym which is really nice! they have a 30 min weigh training/session type of room that's very useful! They don't have a stair stepper. All of their cardio equipment have TV's. Only downfall is that the hours are very very very super limited!!!!!! If they extend their hours, especially on weekends, they would have more people signing up at their gym. Other than that nothing beats $10-20 a month + an annual fee each year.",

  "text": "True 24/7 365 gym, you want to workout on Christmas?  The doors will open!  I say this because too many other gyms say they are 24/7 365 but that is an outright lie.  This place is always open and for some of us that is all we need.\n\nThis is my home gym, it's great and it's private.  A wonderful group of gym goers reside here, seriously as a gym rat environment is everything to me and I really like the people here.  People grunt and whatnot but it is a very relaxed environment, I would say what makes this location unique is no matter what room you are in it feels very private.  I first trained in this building when it was Fitness 19 but the owners of Fitness Factory actually put it together quite a bit better.  Possibly expanded it?\n\nOk, for my bodybuilding friends, here are the unique features you will enjoy:\n\nPrivate room with video- Yes!  A room where you can close the door and train in front of a huge mirror, lift weights, kettle bells, jump rope poorly, stretch or whatever PRIVATELY!!  They also have a TV with videos to train to P90X, some others not P90X.....I should do more cardio.......  Pretty cool I just tried the yoga one, keyword- tried.\n\nTwo large aerobic rooms- You have full access to these when the classes aren't happening, this is also becoming unique in the industry as many of their competitors don't offer this.  This one has pull up bars in both rooms, jump ropes, tension bands, balance balls, foam rollers, and kettle bells in each room.  This one also has a hanging punching bag, that is in great condition and gloves to wear so it will stay that way (please don't bare knuckle the bag jerks, that's how they rip) also you should probably wash your hands after any workout ;) .  Also they have two pairs of the long ropes cabled to the ground, these are awesome and put in a wise place.\n\nAccess to the Stereo- What!?!?! Yes, as in most of Fitness Factory gyms you can hook your MP3, Phone or IPod to their internal stereo system and listen to your music in the aerobic rooms, I have to say this is absolutely unique to the Idaho Fitness Factory and gives that \"your personal gym\" feel, no other gym would offer this option and the first time you don't get hooked up in your headphones making a makeshift yoga noose you will really appreciate it, I know I do.\n\nTVs- With channels changers!!!  Again this is unheard of in other gyms but smart believe it or not, not every bodybuilder loves sports and wants to watch the same game on 6 screens.  Ironically when I see the biggest guys in there it's usually on cartoons, you knew what this was!\n\nUnique Weightlifting equipment:\nGrounded Olympic bar- Right in the main room one side of the bar hooked to the ground, this is great for rows and shoulder presses, a personal favorite of many serious lifters.\n\nAssisted pull up machine- Not necessarily unique but this very machine is how I did my first pull up, they are so great for pyramids and finishing exercises.  This one is unique to the others I've seen as you can fold up the knee pad to get it out of the way rather than putting a weight on it.  I like it a lot.\n\nSquat rack with Assist bars- Actually two different racks both different types, I love and use both types.  Yes I use this to increase my bench press without a spotter, boo me if you will.  This one also has pullup handles....just in case.\n\nStiff Row Machine- I honestly don't even know the name because I've never seen one in 18 years of lifting. Pretty much you add weights and sit on the machine it has both angles for hand grips, this machine is awesome for Rhomboid and Shoulder exercises and of course Rows.\n\nCorner Cable Machine- When working those shoulders or underhanded chest flies you can't beat these machines!!  Many diff\n\nStationed Pec Dec- A lot has been said about Pec Decs over the years but these machines give you some of the best chest squeezes money can buy.  This pec deck has floating pads as compared to the old ones that expected everyone to have the same width of shoulders and arm length.  This is another one of my favorites for sure.\n\nTanning Bed (Premium Only):\nThis tanning bed is awesome the room is large so you can change without feeling like you are in a closet.  The tanning bed has a powerful fan that keeps you cool, I mean most have fans but this one works because it's very new.\n\nKids Room:  \nWell I don't have kids but I can say it was smart to have the kids room facing the general area rather than hidden in a nook somewhere, like so many other gyms.  I see parents put their kids in there and be perfectly able to watch them from the floor, well thought out indeed.\n\nCardio Equipment-\nYou know I don't do cardio :).  Just kidding a few unique ones:\nA stairclimber with independent moving stairs\nThe dreaded row machine\nA couple different types of treadmills (they appear to actually know that belts need tightened here, this is the first gym I've been to where the belts felt right and I didn't feel like I was going to fall)\nOther stuff etc....",

  "text": "I've been a member of this gym since 2009 as it was convenient to work. I have seen many positive changes recently in the way the facility is being managed, and in a holistic sense. This includes everything from manager presence and customer service, to trainer availability, to back office operations (billing, membership), to equipment maintenance, to signage. I won't get into the previous problems because those weren't issues that should be attributed to current management. But it is worthwhile to note that there is a big contrast.\n\nFor what the gym provides--various cardio and weight machines plus ample free weights; studio for floor work (BOSU, orbs, mats, more free weights kettle balls, etc), spinning bikes and classes; non-gender bathroom and gendered bathrooms with showers--I think my membership is a good value. A feature of Anytime Fitness that I particularly like is that one can truly go anytime. I've been on holidays and at 12midnight and felt safe and secure even when alone in the gym. \n\nWith Anytime only one short block from the Monon, on nice weather days I like to run the trail then duck in for upper body weight lifting. That makes for an especially convenient and fun total-body workout.\n\nThe new managers have made me feel appreciated. They had a week-long Customer Appreciation party last Fall that was super fun and helped get me out of my workout box by trying new equipment and meeting personal/class trainers. I hope they continue to do things like that once in a while.",

I know I'm on the never ending quest for the next great workout in Philly, and I'm glad I took my search to this studio. \n\nI tried the Rittenhouse Rowzone classes after recommendations from my coworkers and a great Living Social deal. And now I'm back for more! \n\nRowzone bootcamp classes combine rowing machine sets on the erg with weights and calisthenics. Each class I've been to has been different, based upon the instructor and the day. Usually it's a good mix of cardio and weights that keeps your heart rate up throughout the entire class. The room is well stocked with top of the line ergs, lots of weights, mats, towels and resistance bands.\n\nEvery instructor I've had has been good - they're a great mix between motivational and form-focused. I'm not sure what the qualification is for being an instructor here, but it doesn't seem like everyone has been a rower. I rowed in college, though, and know that the form they teach in the class is spot on.\n\nAll in all, a great workout and a very fun 45 minute sweatfest.

  "text": "Santa Barbara Athletic Club is a solid three stars \"A-OK\" and \"meh, I experienced (much, much) better.\" For the avid Yelpers out there, you get the subtext. Is it the best athletic club in Santa Barbara? Maybe? ... Is it comparable to any other high end athletic club in a major city, definitely not! \n\nThe club itself is dated. The equipment is dated. The locker rooms are dated. The group exercise classes are often out of touch. There is a lot of potential. With the right investors, ownership and management this could be a great club but as it stands now, SBAC is on par (and it many areas under par) with your standard run of the mill gym. There are gyms in nearby cities like Los Angeles and San Diego, for example, with up-to-date, state of the art equipment in pristine, clean condition offering memberships at $10 a month. \n\nSBAC survives in Santa Barbara because no one has built a better alternative and if you're an SB native, you may not even be aware of what you're missing. In that case, ignorance can be bliss. \n\nWithout a major renovation, here are a few things that could be improved immediately. \n- CLEAN the locker rooms thoroughly multiple times a day, daily. There are areas in the ladies locker room collecting so much dust and grime it looks like they have not be cleaned in years. \n- CLEAN the equipment multiple times a day, daily. (It amazes me that in a \"high end\" club like this, I have never seen staff wiping down equipment in almost a year. This is a standard practice even in most bargain gyms.) \n- Improve customer service, starting with...a smile. It's easy, watch :) There are a couple of good staff but the majority of the folks behind the front desk spend their time talking to one another, (sometimes whilst folding towels) while guests are waiting patiently to speak with them. \n- Train staff to monitor supplies and keep them stocked. Almost daily, if I want to utilize a complimentary water cup or grab tea/coffee, there is always something out of stock. Be it a cup but no lids, straws but no cups, cups but no coffee, or some confluence of the above. (This will prevent guests from having to go back downstairs and interrupt your gossip/flirting sessions happening behind the front desk in order to ask for those items to be replenished.) \n\nIn terms of renovations, I'd love to see the ladies' showers improved. The water pressure trickles out and halts when someone flushes the toilet, hooks instead of rings, add a fixture in the shower for folks to set their razor, shampoo, etc if they bring their own toiletries, an opaque shower wall would be nice. (I don't need to see the woman in the stall next to me scrubbing her ass crack and I'd rather not be on display to her as I scrub mine). Replace the flimsy shower curtains with heavy duty curtains that don't blow and stick to ones' body. Invest in quality, standard towels (or better) and get rid of the tiny, brittle towels currently offered. Guests will use less towels if they are larger and more absorbent. \n\nNow for some positive attributes. This is a club for all ages. It does not matter if you're 19 or 119 years old, you will have peers at SBAC doing fitness things throughout the facilities. You can feel comfortable joining with the entire family, your teens, your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, or even your great-great grandparents. No will feel out of place. It's truly a club for all ages. \n\nA few pro-tips: \n- Ladies, lift weights! Diversify your workout for optimal results. Ignore the chauvinists in the weight room who think building male muscle is more important than a woman building hers. (Beware you may find yourself replying, \"Yes, I am using this equipment that is in my hands.\")\n- Bring headphones with ample volume for the cardio room UNLESS you want to be serenaded by a woman who likes to go to the treadmill closest to mirrors and sing loudly for all to hear as she makes faces to herself in the mirror while walking on the treadmill. \n- Don't be alarmed if you open the door to the sauna in the locker room and discover a member of the staff, fully clothed in their uniform sipping a Big Gulp and playing on their phone in the dark. I guess there are not many places for unenthusiastic employees to hideout on the clock.\n\nAnd if you're ever looking for a what a five star experience at an athletic club is supposed to feel like, go visit FIT Athletic Club in Downtown San Diego. It's the best club I've ever belonged to. State of the art equipment, overlooking PETCO, trainers who are World-Class Olympic and Professional athletes, clean, beautiful club.",

  "text": "I have been so bummed to learn that while many things in STL may be cheaper than SF, mani pedis are much more expensive...as are gym memberships. Now, I'm sure I could get a much cheaper membership if I go to an old, dingy gym with limited equipment and no classes, but a comparable gym to what I am used to is the Sante at the Chase. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this place looks great - it's new, extremely clean and as you will see from the pros, there are fab perks. For now, I am giving is a solid three stars (not higher because of the price tag), but as I hope I don't get fat with all of STL's delish, greasy restaurants, perhaps the price will be worth it. \n\nPros: \n- CLEAN. If you read my reviews, you know that I am a total germaphobe. Gyms are usually quite gross, but given that the Sante is still relatively new, the machines are new and the locker rooms are truly impeccable. \n\n- Speaking of the locker room, it is one of the nicest I have seen. The lockers are full sized and you don't need to bring a lock since they all have keypads. The showers are still clean and are stocked with all Aveda products because of the Chase's salon. This is amazing, as it resembles more of a spa than a gym. \n\n- They offer classes with your membership. I have yet to attend, but I will update my review once I have more details. \n\n- They validate your parking in the Chase garage. Platinum members (which I am not) even get valet. \n\n- With my membership, I get a 10 percent discount on the Chase's spa and salon services as well as a discount at a few CWE restaurants and boutiques. This is an awesome perk. \n\nCons: \n- Despite paying what I think is a hefty amount, members still have to pay to use the Chase pool, per day. I'm sorry, that is simply ridiculous. \n\n- The discounts at nearby boutiques are great, but no partnership with Lululemon! I'm sure that is Lululemon's doing, but I have to call it out.",

  "text": "The classes and instructors are wonderful, the manager and front desk staff are AWEFUL. I would give it one star but I love the instructors. The manager is so unfriendly and has ZERO customer service skills. I once witnessed her buying \"stuff\" from a guy \"very discreetly\", or at least she thought so. I grew up in the 70's and know what it was. When you walk up to the front desk they have one person working, and more often than not they are also on their cell phone. Avoid this place if you can. Do yourself a favor and go to the one on Ina. I moved to this gym when it first opened, and now drive much further to avoid it. The only reason this gym has the rating it has is because the trainers offer a free session for a good review. BTW they want $1500 for a trading package. LOL",

Everyone I've encountered at the facility is friendly, and the place is clean and usually not busy just a few hours before closing. Ryan was super helpful with getting me my own membership and I even got to have a personal training session for a day! And if you're looking to pay for a personal trainer I would go with Josh. He is the one I trained with and he just wants you to be knowledgeable about health and fitness, and he also wants you to push yourself so you can get to where you want to be while still feeling comfortable with the pace you're going and the workouts he's giving you. We did a work out for not even 45 minutes and I was sweating and out of breath. David is great at the front desk too. I called to ask something about my membership because I wasn't able to catch Ryan after my work outs, and he ended up fixing what I needed help with! This location is out of my way but I think it is worth it to go here",

  "text": "I was a member here for a year. I really liked the spin classes, the gym itself was clean, well lit and great machines. The reason why I stopped going was because I got a new job further away from the gym. I originally joined this gym due to convenience of my old job. I told the person I signed up with and was told I could only cancel if I moved a certain distance away or medical reasons. Needless to say I paid dues to this gym for 6 months and I didnt even attend. I feel robbed. I just cancelled my contract with ABC fitness so hopefully there arent any further charges come Sept. I have to agree with some other comments you need more than a 3 day pass or offer monthly contracts instead.",

  "text": "OK so I just moved here from ATL and there is much more competition there, so I guess I am just used to a lot better quality gyms for about the same price. The only reason I came here was because every other gym in the New Orleans area that offered classes seemed to be about 80 bucks a month with a high sign up fee, which in my opinion is a little ridiculous.\n\ni absolutely LOVE that they have a women's only workout area because there seriously are about 50 Pauly-D wannabes walking around looking for girls to prey upon. I've never seen so many superficial idiots in one place in my life. If it weren't for the women's only area I would probably NEVER go. \n\nThat being said, the women's only area only has 4 treadmills which is kind of a bummer. I can only make it up there during peak hours (after 5pm) and the treadmills are usually full or close to full. The rest of the women's work out equipment is usually pretty vacant though. It's nice and cool in that area which is a MAJOR plus! It doesn't stink as bad as the rest of the gym. \n\nThe classes that I've taken (spin and zumba) are pretty good. There's always enough bikes in spin and space in zumba. The only thing that sucks is that there are only two zumba classes, one at 8pm on wednesdays (cool) and the other at 5pm on fridays which i absolutely cannot make. I have to say...I've experienced more challenging and fun zumba classes, but for the price you pay for the gym membership i can't complain.\n\nOverall it's... *eh*, decent. Once again I'm coming from a big urban area and gyms here really don't compare to those in Atlanta. So...for the price....this one works for me.",

  "text": "First off  there's the issue of cancelled classes that plagues both this LA Fitness and Montgomeryville: classes are constantly cancelled, if you're lucky there's a sub but half the time you show up and no one is there.  I specifically pay $30 a month FOR PILATES AND YOGA CLASSES--so if the only evening classes offered within a 10-15 mile radius of where I work/live are always cancelled or rescheduled to Zumba or something high impact that hurts my joints it wastes my time and gas money in getting to the gym to find this out.\n\nBringing me to reason 1 of why this location in particular sucks: front desk staff are particularly rude and completely unknowledgeable.  So I asked to speak to a manager about the pilates class situation and got some guy \"specifically brought in to help that location.\"  He took down my info and offered to call me back with answers within 24 hours.  3 days later I call back and it's like we never even talked, he has no memory of offering to call me back and all he can tell me is that \"the activities person was in today working.\"  Great so does that mean she fixed the pilates class situation? \"I don't know\" was my response.    \n\nOn top of all that this location always appears dirty and dingy, the air conditioning in the room where classes are held does not work, and there's an infernal \"beeping\" all throughout the classes and all the instructors say they don't know how to make it stop (it's really distracting during something like yoga where otherwise the room is silent).  It's always crowded, hard to park, and the locker room is filthy compared to every other location.  Also I hate how all the machines are close together and stuffed into one level--it's just a very poorly designed space and it makes the chore of working out even less appealing.\n\nThis location is by far the worst of the 5 LA Fitnesses I've been to (including Montgomeryville, Fort Washington, Downingtown, and West Chester).  Sadly it's by far the closest one to where I live of course.  Which makes me wonder why they won't open a location in Lansdale...",

  "text": "I am torn on this review. My SO and I joined before the Channelside location was open, when they were still getting together. We were super excited for a new gym that promised so many things, new equipment, amazing classes, and state of the art everything. \nSo I am going to break it down! \nWe went when they first opened and hadn't completed everything. I asked for help with the machines and setting up a walk through and I was gym-shamed. It was a very uncomfortable situation. I figured ok, I can give them another chance and no worries. \nWe went back again, again asked how to use the equipment, we were given a brief tour, much better this time. We were encouraged to set up a meeting with a trainer. We started going almost daily getting comfortable and then I needed a break. While on the break, I received a super sweet text from a trainer wanting 30 minutes of my time. She was super sweet, supportive and very genuine. Not being able to commit for the time she asked, I told her it would have to wait. She followed up with me with words of encouragement and the same whenever she saw me in the gym. LOVED it. If you get a chance, make an appointment with Takara. She is super sweet and very dedicated. \nLet's start with why the 2 stars:\n-Sign you up for text messaging and don't stop when you ask\n-Text you offers that are only for new members\n-Not everyone there is friendly or wants to help\n-Management is unable to make changes or just doesn't care\n-Some trainers don't listen when you are trying to work with medical issues ( arthritis, bad knees, etc.) they are just focused on getting you to spend a lot more money\n-You are always being pressured to purchase more. More sessions, more of the trainers time and to commit to 3 or 6 month programs\n-Most of the classes are only 30 minutes long. \n-They aren't very good at enforcing gym etiquette\nNow as for the 4.5 stars:\n-Several people there (Takara and Dr. Crunch) are amazing, they care and are happy to explain things\n-The equipment is amazing, there are lots of options and you can go in for 30 minutes or 3 hours. \n-Everything is clean. \n-Lots of parking\n-They are happy to take the time to explain how a machine works\n-the cost is super affordable\n-they offer many local partnerships where you can get special discounts. \nFor the most part, the positive outweighs the negative. And if you are just looking for a place to work out and be done, this is it.",

  "text": "Having attended a Division I college for undergrad, I'd thought I had access to the best college sports facility during my four years there. Reily Center blows it FAR out of the water. \n\nMembership is open to the community at a very affordable price, with so many options of group exercise classes catering to even Seniors and kids (so much so there's a cute playroom under the stairs ). I absolutely love that. Seeing 10-something year olds running to class in their white taekwondo uniforms is such a pleasant sight. My eyes could use a break from grunting frat bros and sorority biddies in their tight fancy lululemon athletic gears. \n\nThe classes consist of typical offerings like PIyo, Zumba, Cardioboxing and so much more. I'm impressed by the specifically focused body toning/conditioning classes  e.g. AA (Ab-solutely Abs) ABT (Abs Buns And Thighs), Strength on the Ball though I have yet to check them out. Most classes are free for members, with the exception of Spinning and Bodypump. An avid spinner, I purchased a semester pass for 40 dollars, which allows me to reserve a bike for an upcoming class! This system works SO well. I recall many a time driving to my undergrad gym to catch my 6:00 class, only to find that all bikes were occupied. \n\nThese instructors are serious athletes themselves, and SO much more energetic and than my NYSC instructors! \n\nAllow me to just list why this may be the best college athletic facility: Digitally operated lockers, new equipments (probably equal to if not better than $200/month Crunch gym), spacious Olympic-sized pools, and in the Spring they open a small social pool with a sun deck. There's a great recently renovated indoor track for runners who dread the heat of New Orleans summer, and it's complete with a digital timer for serious runners!\n\nStudent-staff are well-trained and always available to answer all questions. \n\nI really feel for those living in the downtown campus, since they live inconveniently far from this awesome gym. Kudos to Tulane for really caring about students' health.",

I had a friend that praised this place and after awhile when one popped up in mid city, I decided to give it a try. Initially I said no because of the price, but once you calculate the cost it's really not so bad. Health is wealth baby. Immediately from my first class, I knew I had made a good decision. Not only was the staff extremely welcoming and personable, but I loved everything about the concept. It literally pushes you to work harder and get in shape. I don't have the drive to do it on my own, so fortunately this was exactly what I needed. I've been coming for 3 months now and no workout has ever been the same. I love the energy when u walk inside. For people like me who have extremely hectic and inconsistent work schedules, this is perfect. All you do is download the app and you schedule according to what works best for you. They have classes all day at all different times. If your wondering about bringing headphones or making a playlist, don't bother. The instructors have the music bumping when u walk in. I haven't taken everyone's class, but Brandon, Jeff, and Josh's music selection definitely will have you in the zone. Everyone needs a little trap music in their life lol. If I haven't convinced you by now, then go in and see for yourself. They willingly will give u a walk through and let u do a trial class. Thank me later!",

  "text": "I am not your typical \"gym rat\" in any sense. I'm overweight, have asthma and have never been able to dedicate myself to any physical activity for more than 3 months at a time. \nThat all changed when I joined Crossfit Renaissance in June 2014. I was getting nowhere with going to the regular gym off and on when I felt like it, so I signed up for a Groupon figuring I'd give it a shot and I never stopped. \nOne of the first things Bill said during my intro session was \"Crossfit is for anyone, but it's not for everyone. We expect you to work hard and give it everything you've got, but we will never push you past where you are physically able to go.\" Considering everything I'd read/heard about CF coaches pushing people to injury, this was pretty relieving. \nAnd he was totally right and I'm still going. The coaching by Bill, Ray and Kevin (and Reese, but I have only worked with him twice) is at the same time supportive and demanding. They know what your potential is and they won't let you stop until you reach it. The other gym members (teammates) are fantastic and encourage you to keep going. It really is a family, as cliched as that sounds. The gym itself is spacious and, well laid out. Okay, the freezing cold kettlebells, barbells and everything-else-metal sucks in the winter, but whatever. \nWatching my PRs (personal records) go up over the months and my endurance get better and my absolute love for lifting heavy things and putting them down has been awesome. I wouldn't trade it for anything. I wish more people would come give it a shot to experience the same thing. \nCome on over, we've got lots of fist bumps to give.",

The moves & clothes they sell were the only thing \"yoga\" about this place.\n\n If all you want is an intense workout, this may be the establishment for you (though it was far too intense for me-i am in shape, petite, have done traditional yoga and bikram before fyi). If you are looking for actual yoga practice of any form, go elsewhere. (For example, Divini Tree is true to yoga practice, and has classes that provide an intense workout with a mindfulness format, amongst others in town I've heard about)",

Especially since in Los Angeles, California the unlimited monthly price is $99! It really sounds like somebody made a bad business deal on the CycleBar here in town and we are the ones who have to make up for it. I would love to see this location and other locations excel in membership and do well because I really do like going. But I refuse to pay that price. Yes they have packages that results in lower fees overtime but I am a regular cyclist and would like to go more than 10 times a month which also cost $180. I will raise the star rating when the prices lowered to something more fair. Over all the facilities were excellent, I think they need more than two showers. The instructor that I had and the equipment that I used were stellar. And I really appreciate the 6 o'clock start time that got me to work on time as well.",

And if you book through Class Pass she scolds you for writing less than a 5 star review.  That is what other Class Passers have told me so I didn't write a review on the site for fear of losing my membership.\n\nThe instructor touched me while giving a correction in a way that made me uncomfortable and I wouldn't return because of that.  If you're a man you probably won't have that problem.  But the actual class wasn't very structured or challenging and I'm not in great shape or anything.  It should have been hard for me.  There was not much rowing on the machine.  The instructor had us throwing weights around with no corrections so everyone was doing things wrong.  Even someone with little weight training experience and who just started working out again like me could see that.\n\nAfter the treatment myself and others received, along with the bullying emails, I would not return.",

The place did not smell good and I swear I smelled urine at one point.  The lady that showed us around was very nice, however the stares and glances from the members were not friendly at all.  The equipment looked old for the most part , dirty, and in a few, rusty.  Rusty and musty is not good for a gym!  This fitness club looked every bit of its age, 27 (Built in 1986). The pool seemed decent, is available most if the time, but not enough to justify the price and overcome the above limitations and weaknesses of the club.",

  "text": "I've been a member of Lifetime Fitness for 7 years and I've worked out at various Lifetimes all over the country.  Until recently, my home Lifetime was in Michigan at a so-called \"gold-level\" club.  This facility in Tampa is a \"diamond-level\" club, but it doesn't even begin to compare to my previous gym.  I'm paying double what I paid for at a gold-level Lifetime ($60 per month more), but yet the facility is so much smaller and has much less equipment and other amenities.  Most notably, there is no pool!  My previous Lifetime had 3 pools, a rock climbing wall, basketball courts, and racquetball courts.  It was also several thousand square feet larger and had a ton of various weightlifting equipment that is missing from this club.  This club is also not open 24-hours/day unlike most Lifetime clubs.  I understand that this is considered a boutique club for Lifetime, but it's honestly ridiculous for the price.  \n\nThere are some pros that are worth mentioning.  Although the facility is much smaller than it appears from the outside, it is beautifully decorated and very clean.  I enjoy having a spa in the locker room.  Equipment-wise, they do have amazing Olympic weightlifting racks and bumper plates and some nice equipment for functional training (sand bags, stacked boxes, TRX).  They have a fantastic room dedicated to yoga that is soothing and kept warm.  I've been going to this club since they opened in April and most of the time, I am one of only a few that are on the floor lifting, so there is no waiting for equipment.  The salon is wonderful and they have some beautiful, relaxing massage rooms that are isolated from the rest of the club.  Every single employee that I've encountered is very friendly and provides excellent service.           \n\nOverall, it is a beautiful facility, but it just doesn't begin to compare to other Lifetime clubs that have much cheaper membership rates, but far more amenities.  Perhaps if I hadn't already been spoiled by other Lifetime experiences, I would be more satisfied with this club.  I do think that they need to lower the membership rates.  I turn 30 in a few months and they told me that my membership dues will increase by another $20.  I'm not sure how that makes sense to base membership dues on age ranges.  I never had that experience at my other Lifetime club.  At any rate, I'll be finding another gym before my birthday.",

  "text": "Saw Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible working out. Only celeb so far. He's ripped!!  \n\nIn terms of the clientele: My first 1.5 years as a member, I had positive, friendly responses when i initiated conversation with people but almost noone ever initiated w. me, was very standoffish--sort of an insider/club feel, but that's not something that bothers me--I don't take it personally--more Philly weirdness, and this is a weird freaking town, if you've ever lived somewhere else.  \nAfter 1.5 years of getting used to me-people are starting to say \"hi\". That's a long freaking initiation, people!\n\nSome of the patrons think that when they are on a machine that it's their personal property.   They're reluctant to let someone \"work in\".  I had someone say \"no, I have one set left,\" and then they sat on the machine and sent a text message.  A perfect comeback would have been--\"I understand.  Why don't you send me a text when you're done with the machine?\"  But alas, I didn't think of it until a day later.  Drat!!  I attribute this to to spoiled behavior of certain people that are raised in privilege, however, I know plenty of rich people that are extremely polite, hard working, and considerate.  \n\nIt will be fascinating to see how Sporting Club ups its game if an upscale competitor ever opens close by.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the place is very clean, there's tons of equipment, unlimited towels,\n\n I hear the classes are mostly excellent, the lounge area is awesome, the food is good--there's a lot to recommend.  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal post:\nWorkout area overlooks a basketball court and the games are sometimes LOUD w ref whistle and guys yelling. I wrote a note on the gyms facebook page and the moderator said they'd pass my comment on to the manager. Does that mean anything in terms of customer service? Not really. No response five weeks after posting. I hear old timers talk about how they dislike the new management. Still is a very nice gym.",

  "text": "This place has a lot going on and I'm going to apologize if this review comes off as scattered because I want to make sure I include as much as possible.\n\nI can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet. This place is huge with lots of parking, but I imagine it can be packed on weekends. IncrediPlex has a lot of variety of activities. Our experience was during a holiday off from school and with the games and blow up things. The kids can play on the blow up things for $6 Mon-Thur and I believe a dollar or two more Fri-Sun. For kids 2 and under, it's free. And for a good reason. \n\nThe kids I take care of are 2 and 5, even though the 2 year old tried the monkey slide a couple of times, she didn't like it much afterwards. Plus she's on the small size, so it's a bit of an extra challenge for her. It was great for her brother, I think overall I'd recommend this for ages 4 and up.\n\nSince we went on a Monday, they had a special with the game card. Put $10 on the card and they'll match it. And they don't charge you for the card either. The games were in a range of prices from I believe $.50 to $1.50, maybe $2.. I like that they list how much a game costs at the game and how much you have left on your card after you swipe it to play a game. I feel like it's easier to keep track of compared to Dave & Buster's. With the card you can play the video/arcade games, I feel like you can use the card to do the bungee jumper and the climbing wall. I think the laser tag is apart of that, but I can't recall. So those might be a little bit more than the other games, but not bad. Plus you win tickets and there's a machine to collect and count your ticket amount and put it on the card so you can get the usual toy fair.\n\nThere's also a bowling area near the games with at least half a dozen bowling lanes. Also a snack concession and an adults bar area. There are multiple tables to sit and eat, as well as numerous leather chairs and couches to sit and watch your kids play. And there's wifi, you just have to ask for the password as it's protected. This place is also geared for birthday parties.\n\nAdditionally, IncrediPlex has turf fields, hardwood courts, sport court, modified baseball/softball diamond. Plus there's an indoor fitness center. I didn't see all these areas, but what I did see looked impressive. This link will give you more info about their pricing and attractions: http://www.incredi-plex.com/public/family_entertainment/attractions_and_pricing.cfm\n\nAnyway, if you're looking to take your kids somewhere fun, or for a birthday party or a sporting event, definitely check this place out.",

The bikes were a little unusual but easy to adjust and actually easier than most to use. The staff was warm and friendly. The teacher was excellent, and her music (unlike most places) was not too loud or too offensive.  The price is competitive, but you can do one class for free. I was lucky to get a bike where I could see in a mirror (I love to watch my form), but there were a lot of bikes that did not have mirrors nearby.  There is a bathroom with a shower but I am not sure the shower is for spinners as opposed to employees.  They give you towels and have water for purchase at the usual way-too-high-how-does-water-cost-this-much price.",

  "text": "Cyclebar is a great! I attended my first class for free to see if it was something I liked to do and instantly fell in love. The facility is super clean, beautiful and cozy. I love that they provide cycling shoes and lockable lockers. It's the little touches that make each ride just so good.\n\nAs for my first ride: I was exhausted! I typically avoid cardio at all costs, but have recently have wanted to work it into my routine. I would say that I came in with a moderate level of fitness and was sore the day after class. The great thing is that you make the ride fit your level. I signed up for the 8 classes/ month. \n\nSubsequent rides: I have not been here for a full month yet, but I am seeing improvements already. In my first class I was unable to stand up on the pedals easily and was generally struggling to keep going for the full 45 minutes. I have since gotten better and have even started to increase resistance. I love the motivational format because it makes me want to push myself beyond my previous performance. \n\nI would highly recommend this class even if you have no prior cycling experience (like myself) or think you might hate it (also like myself). The facilities plus the instructors make this an amazing place to improve your fitness.",

However, I have canceled my membership for several reasons:\n-Weekend Hours are TERRIBLE- seriously, it doesn't open until 11am on Sunday...evening hours aren't great either for us working people under 65\n-They DON'T provide towels- what? It's a brand new shiny gym, with people that walk around with old dish towels from home while they use 'state of the art equipment'\n-The fees are high considering childcare is not included on a single membership for about $45/ month and a $90 sign up fee. To use the childcare area, you have to have a family membership or something and it's REALLY expensive compared to other gyms in the area.\n-Gym area has nice machines, but is just too small\n-Front Desk staff are nice, but didn't really care when I wanted to sign up, never got a tour of the building and have seen this happen many times with other newbies when they join.\n-Showers have bodywash or something in the dispensers, but it's not labeled- also, other high priced gyms I have been to provide shampoo, conditioner and bodywash in the dispensers for convenience. \n\nI just feel this gym wants top dollar for their memberships with very little perks. I have toured several other gyms nearby after becoming unhappy with my membership at the YMCA and unfortunately they are all cheaper and provide more amenities, even the other smaller gyms like this one.",

This week we decided to cancel our membership due to them over billing us (against our contract).  Our contract clearly states our first charge will be in February, yet they billed us in December and January (which we had already paid for when we joined).  It also states the annual fee will be due in April, yet they billed us in February.  I went to cancel our membership online (as stated by ABC financial whom I had already emailed explaining our situation), but it shows I have to pay an invoice for September (the gym wasn't even open in September) and also October- when I want to close it out for being over-charged. Even the customer service rep for ABC financial had our contract but couldn't explain why I was billed for December and January.  He kept telling me I need to talk to the gym.  So we went to the gym and wouldn't you know it- the manager wasn't there, so we left our letter of cancellation explaining it all, along with our contract (aka legal binding document) and will see what happens.  We also contacted our bank and canceled the auto payments.  The gym itself is fine, but it's not worth the cost, since we've been overcharged since the beginning.\nWould I recommend this gym?  No way!  Not worth the hassle.  There's a reason they don't list an email as a form of contact- lots of angry gym goers.",

Additionally, if your more suited to isolation machines, then you'll find everything you need to target every major muscle group in your body. There's also a number of machines that will target the smaller muscles as well so there should be something for everyone. \n\nGreat price, great location, incredible variety of the best equipment and 24 hour access.

My only complaint is that I travel for a living and I can't take SoHo Cycling with me when I leave for work  skip the chain cycling places, it's worth getting up before dawn ‚Äç",

Utilizing the latest in sports medicine/fitness technology, Quantify sincerely makes it possible to work out SMARTER not LONGER or HARDER. \nWe've been members for over a year. And along with the recommended nutrition plan (that the staff is all very knowledgeable about) within my first 3 months, I  lost 7% body fat and gained 5 lbs of lean muscle. And I've been able to maintain. As a 45 year old woman that use to work out 7 days a week at a very high intensity - this is a wonderful and welcomed change! \nHighly recommend!",

  "text": "I have been a member at both this gym and Sports West for a few months now, so time to write some reviews!  I continue to pay for both because neither wholly completes me.  For now.  But I do have a comparative perspective that may help.\n\nSRAC.\n\nPROS:\n1.  Newish equipment.  They just brought in a fleet of new incline machines, about which they are very excited.  Not my cup o' Earl Grey, but it seems they want some of the latest, so that's always good.  The Nautilus-type weight machines appear mostly new and everyone that I have used is in good working order.\n\n2.  I have never had a maintenance issue at this gym, i.e., never tried to use a machine only to discover one of those dastardly Out-of-Order notes.\n\n3.  The indoor track.  It's a PRO just to have one!  In addition, this one has some great impact-absorption that has helped me lose that LawSchool20# without injury.\n\nCONS:\n1.  Contract.  Beware.\n\n2.  Douchebag Alert!  So, beyond the typical preening, sneering front-desk personnel, there is a jacked-up Spin Class Director who is NUTS!  He is loud, obnoxious and confrontational.  Also, this place overrun by personal trainers and boot camp participants.  BUT, this place is huge, so it's not that hard to run away from them.\n\n3.  The indoor track.  Only rarely do people actually use this to do any serious running.  As a result, it has slowly been annexed by the basketball court.  They close lanes and the omnipresent teenage basketball and volleyball campers stand in the lanes.  Hard to take advantage of this resource.\n\n4.  This gym's focus is not the person working out, it is rather all the \"extra-curricular\" they have going on (boot camps, training sessions, ball camp, etc.).",

  "text": "I visited this studio this past weekend. I was in from Chicago where I regularly work out at orange theory.  I brought my friend who paid the drop in fee for one class. Of course the work out was great, but the staff ruined our experience. The coach was clearly very checked out, just going through the motions. He actually checked his cell phone several times during the class! We pay too much money to have coaches who are not active motivators and instructors. Also, my friends heart monitor did not work throughout the entire class. Not once did a front desk staff come to see how they can help! Maybe my home studio has set high expectations ( thanks Lincoln square Chicago!) but I will\nNot be returning to this studio nor would I recommend it for others.",

  "text": "This place was a few minutes' walk from the hotel in which I stayed during an opera training program in July.  In my off time, I found myself at SRAC a lot; I was really impressed with the quality of the facility and fitness classes.  First, the building itself is relatively new and contains a boatload of cardio machines, a spacious free weight area, and even a running track.  I also liked the laned, inclined running track, perfect for quick sprint workouts.  Second, the fitness classes: there were a good variety offered, such as spin classes, zumba classes, and the Les Mills \"Bodypump\" weight classes.  Boot camp classes are also offered, but I think those required an extra fee.  I took as many as I could and can say that all of the instructors I had were friendly, energetic, and enthusiastic.  The only thing I would have liked was a pool, but then again, I can be pretty indecisive and having too many workout options may have incapacitated me!  SRAC does have other services on-site, such as a hair salon and massage therapist.\n\nFYI visitors to Reno: I ended up purchasing an extended guest pass (there was a discount for guests of my hotel, the Extended Stay America).  I believe I paid about $45 for an unlimited 3 week pass (includes all fitness classes, but not boot camp classes).  \n\nSuper clean and bright, lots of fitness options, and free towels to use -- come out and get fit.  :)",

The floor should be seriously scrubbed after every class.

  "text": "This gym has really gone downhill in the last year. Routes are not reset very often, especially in the bouldering area, where they might stay up for three months. It's really dirty and everything is covered in chalk dust. It took nearly 2 years for the pads to be replaced in one part of the bouldering cave and there still are not enough to protect falls from corner top outs, some of the most dangerous parts of the problems. The walls are falling apart - holds are literally being pulled off! A superficial coat of high gloss paint was applied in the bouldering area, which doesn't fix the structural points and now makes the wall incredibly slippery. There is also very little reliability in ratings. Generally, they run more difficult than you'd expect from the ratings, but occasionally there are some that are incredibly off. Top rope problems are often height-dependent, so if you are less than 5'10\" they'll probably feel a few grades more difficult than the ratings.\n\nI would never climb here if there were a gym owned by someone else in Tucson. Unfortunately, the same negligent guy owns The Bloc and it takes me an hour to drive there. So I'm stuck with this expensive, poor quality place.",

I knew going in i did not want any personal training sessions and asked them to please remove me from any list that would give my number to crunch to call to solicit personal sessions. I literally received a call within the first week. When I asked them to please not call back, they said ok and then I got another one the next week. Also, there are sooo many people standing around taking selfies of themselves it is impossible to get anything done. The locker room is dirty and they don't enforce people wiping down the machines after using them. Also, I have never seen anyone who works there cleaning the locker room or the equipment. \n\nThe worst part was that I went to cancel my membership (which they make you do in person), and I couldn't cancel without paying the annual fee...even though I had only gone for 2 months and paid an enrollment fee.

  "text": "I have very mixed feelings about this gym. Customer service and upgrades are severely lacking, but the tucked away location allows for low crowds of people.\n\nThe main reason I go to Conshy Health & Fitness is because it's walking distance from my workplace in the Spring Mill corporate center. If it weren't so damn convenient, you would definitely not find me here. Its customers seem like mostly normal people, with the occasional bro wandering in and doing shoulder shrugs in front of all the dumbbells.\n\nEquipment: There's a good number of aerobic machines (treadmills, ellipticals, bikes), but the weights, benches, etc. are lacking. The dumbbells are old and rusted, there are only 2 flat benches, 1 incline, 1 decline, and only 2-3 bars to go around between the 4. Fortunately, this isn't usually a problem because the gym never gets too crowded (a definite benefit). The rest of the equipment is useable, but still could use upkeep.\n\nClasses: I've never done the classes, but my roommate says they're fine. They do a crossfit class on Wednesdays in the morning, which is annoying for the rest of the gym since they use a bunch of different sections.\n\nTraining: Private training exists, albeit few and far between, but there are NO trainers who watch the floor, so there are no rules to follow and no one to spot you.\n\nStaff: Staff seem generally nice, albeit bored most of the time. They aren't the friendliest and don't go out of their way to get to know people, but they aren't unfriendly either.\n\nLocker Rooms: The locker rooms are nice (at least the men's is), and has a sauna and showers in it.\n\nPrice: I pay $34.99 monthly, and I think the yearly plans are a bit cheaper than that.\n\nOverall\nPros:\n-$35 a month is okay\n-Almost never crowded\n-Customers are relatively normal people\n-Has a sports drink fridge (not included in the price, though)\n\nCons:\n-No trainers on site except for private lessons\n-NO rules to follow and so people use multiple machines, do what they want, etc.\n-Equipment is older\n-No real sports equipment or basketball court (there is one hoop, but it's outdated and in the class room)\n-Doesn't seem to be a community built around the gym\n-No workout towels or other amenities\n\nOverall, if you're working in the area, it's a bad option, but it's convenient. It leaves a lot to be desired, but it's good for getting your workout done and getting out.",

Key 2 Fitness is the real MVP: cleanliness, quality of equipment, friendly members, 24/7 access...this gym has it all!  \n\nThe best part of the gym by far is the cleanliness.  I have visited this gym as early as 5am and as late as 2am and everywhere in between and every single time it is immaculate.  Other members actually wipe down the equipment after each use.  The bathrooms and showers are continually clean and dry.  \n\nThe variety of equipment is also impressive, from free weights, TRX and traditional squat racks/bench presses/machines.  I've never seen this place packed, and everyone is always respectful and friendly when using equipment.\n\nIf you want a full access gym without the intimidation or insane enrollment prices, come to Key 2 Fitness.  I cannot recommend it any higher.",

Most of the equipment I saw was either brand new or in fantastic shape. Met the owner when signing up, and he seemed like an extremely nice guy who cared a lot about thoughtfully setting up and managing a great gym (he also personally helped me try to track down a set of keys I had left behind at one of the treadmills). Facility itself has basketball courts, pool, and sauna, although I think the pool and sauna might require a somewhat more expensive tier of membership (which still seemed like a great deal though). Great gym overall & would definitely recommend checking it out.",

Today, I attempted to use one of his visits (Valid, he still had 2 left for the month) The woman at the front desk who told me that she recognized me makes me fill out another enrollment form, saying I wasn't in the system (untrue). I only had 20 minutes to work out and I did tell her this so filling out the paperwork for the upteenth time was an inconvienience. I wanted to go get my boyfriend so we could just go to Bay Club with less of a hassle and was unable to go back to grab him on the floor as she prohibited me from doing so because I would not provide my phone number to get endless sales calls/e-mails from the club. I visit SBAC twice a month with a boyfriend who is a member. Recently, we decided we should both go to the same gym and I was thinking about switching over from Bay Club, but based on the rudeness of the woman at the front desk, I will not be signing up.",

At least 1 machine seems to be broken every week. There's a handful of benches to use for the weights. During busy times, good luck using 5s, 10s, 15s or 20s because there will be none in sight. There are multiple signs all over the gym. Worst of all, is the women's locker room! Doors falling off of the lockers. The toilets haven't been cleaned in FOREVER. The shower curtains literally have gaping holes in them. What's the point of a shower curtain?! For paying $30 a month and an annual $30 fee, I am highly disappointed in platinum. The only reason I don't want to cancel is for the Zumba instructor on Monday nights, she's awesome!",

  "text": "I've been a member at DFT for nearly a year now, and it's probably about time that I wrote a review! There are several things that I love about DFT. First of all, it can be intimidating starting at a new gym, but all the trainers make you feel comfortable about asking questions and seeking feedback. There are also women of all ages, shapes, sizes and fitness levels. If you have an injury to work around, they will gladly offer you modifications so you can still have a great workout. They focus a lot on form, not necessarily on reps or the amount of weight. Despite it being a group class, you can often work at your own pace. They offer words of encouragement and motivation, but ultimately, it's up to you to put in the energy. And the workouts are often TOUGH, especially the CardioStrong classes! I have been able to achieve things I didn't think possible!\n\nI also really appreciate that DFT holds me accountable for showing up. I used to belong to Club Fitness, and I would find that I never had the motivation to go. What really works for me at DFT is that if I sign up for a class, I have 4 hours before the class starts to cancel without being penalized. I don't want to lose that class if I don't show up or cancel ahead of time. While I don't always have the motivation to go to the gym, I now have to think really hard about not showing up! I pay for a certain number of classes each month, and I want to get the most out of my membership!\n\nAnyway, I can't say enough nice things about DFT, the women who work there, and the women who show up to workout!",

I have not taken one spin class anywhere else that compares to Hannah, Robbie, or Patty (even though she had been long gone). It is seriously hard to accept anything else after being a member here. Clif was my personal trainer for about 2 years then I used him on and off here and there. I also did one of his challenges which was great but too cliquey. I took the first challenge Hannah offered which was amazing and challenging as well. \n\nDuring my last 2 and a half years there I was an executive member because I got tired of carrying my gym clothes. They lost my favorite (and most expensive) sports bra but did give me a free month, which costs more than the bra. I can't complain about any of the classes, instructors, or special workout events they had here because it was all great and worth almost 100 percent. Toward the end, it started to feel like a high school which made it easier for me to leave which I was going to do anyway since I was moving. Still doesn't take away from the fact that it was an awesome gym that whipped my ass in to shape.",

  "text": "Really enjoy working out here.\n\nI, too, have been to multiple different places and do different exercise regimens often because I like variety. Although for me, Orange Theory seems like a place I could get used to without becoming bored. \n\nIt is a high intensity interval training workout with a combination of cardio and weight training. Each class is 60 minutes, while an instructor guides and ultimately pushes you through this group workout. Half the workout is done on a treadmill and row machine, while the other half is done on the open floor that provides dumbbells, trx etc. It essentially becomes a circuit. However many rounds you can get through with the allotted time. What's important to know is that you are competing with the clock, not the people around you! If you don't finish your reps or even get to it at all, it's no worries..as long as you did your best that you could do. They may call out who ran the fastest mile or 2000 meter row, but not every class is like that.  \n\nIf you're new, you must show up 30 minutes before the class begins to fill out paperwork and to go over everything. They start your free trial off with a heart rate monitor that connects to the flat screens above with your name. It shows your progress and end results as to how many calories you burned, what your max push was during the workout, etc. This will explain the \"orange theory\" being that the orange level on the bar graph will determine the hardest you worked and gives you an idea where you should be or want to work up to.\n\nYou are not required to purchase a monitor there or wear one at all, but they are available at an extra cost and are a bit pricey..\n\nSo far, everyone has been helpful and genuine. I would recommend it, so if this sounds like something of interest to you..sign up for your free trial online!!",

Called early and the front desk rep was very knowledgeable when I asked about how much daily rates were ($17), rental shoes, chalk etc. \n\nHighlights:\n- Daily Rates - Full Day with In and Out privileges. I bouldered for 2 hours, went out to eat and came back alter in the afternoon. \n- For a Saturday from 10-3pm, there were probably a total of 10 other people bouldering the entire time. If you like an environment where it isn't super busy, it can be great.\n- Top Roping was very very popular during my time here. A few classes going on too. \n- Decent bouldering section but wish this gym itself was larger. Seems a bit limited if I had a monthly membership here\n- PLENTY OF PARKING. It's probably amazing to the regulars who don't have to circle for 15 min to find a parking spot. Almost all the gyms I go to have this issue.\n- Staff was nice and knowledgeable. Helped me out and gave me some tips. Kudos to them.",

It's also right across the street from my office! I signed up online, bought a discounted beginner package of 3 classes, and scheduled my classes online as well.\n\nThey have clip-in shoes that you can use for free (or bring your own compatible ones) that they wash after every class along with the towels (as far as I can tell). The bikes are great - fully and easily adjustable, with a light-up screen that shows you things like RPM, an estimate of calories burned, and the resistance level you're currently at, which is really useful. Each instructor has a different personality, which is interesting, so you can get some variety or pick a favorite and schedule your classes with them. You can choose whether or not your stats show on the scoreboard in class, but either way, your results get emailed to you automatically right after each class with a summary of how you did. The mood is great, with low lighting, and the instructor can choose different colors of lights. Depending on the song, there are sometimes videos on the screens up front.\n\nI also love that they have lockers to secure your stuff so you don't have to worry about whatever you bring in, free water bottles which you can fill there, and snacks - I always grab a banana on the way out for a post-workout refuel. During my first class on Saturday, there was a Whole Foods rep there giving out healthy treat samples, which was awesome (but she's not usually there).\n\nOverall, Cyclebar's technology and included perks make it a great spot for a spin class!",

If you walk barefoot at the JCC you are not only walking in dirt but you risk picking up foot fungus as well.  I'm almost sure the one 5 star review was written by one of the staff under direction from their superiors.\n\nThe gym equipment is lacking with an overabundance of treadmills.  Too many times the equipment breaks and then sits for anywhere from a week to a month or two before it gets fixed.  \n\nOf all the JCC's in the Philadelphia are, this one is the most dismal.  The WILF pre-school where my daughter goes is the same building that I used more than 40 years ago with little improvement.  \n\nIt's sad that the money we pay never makes it to the pre-school and that is seen just by walking in the front door.",

  "text": "I've been here a few times and would have given it a 3 had it not been for some recent upgrades. The service is fine and it is a big place, but the layout is odd when you have 3 kids to keep and eye on at the same time. Also, it seems like there are less games than before. Changes I like: more seating! This place is packed on the weekend and there was barely a place to sit for a minute. NOW they've added another separate area with seating. Swipe cards, finally! No more counting tickets and carrying around coin cups. There are also kiosks where you can add more money to the card or check your balance. \nWe went yesterday for my son's 5th Bday and the kids had a blast. There were a few families having birthday cake and pizza there (we went home). If you can swing going on a week day, it's 100% a better experience. Much less crowded. \nI think we will go back during the week again - a great time!\n----\nUpdated 1/8/15\nToday is my 6 year olds birthday and he LOVES this place. Online it says it's open til 9. We called and they confirmed. Went out to dinner and came at 7:30 - they closed early. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. Birthday boy was in tears. How can close of shop change within 3 hours time?\nTotally disgusted.",

This is a no-frills gym that offers good basic service with trainers, available childcare and machines in reasonable working order. If the repairs on machines were made a little more quickly when they break, and there was more space, I'd give it another star. Also if the clocks on the walls were more accurate and the weights more often in their assigned slots.  But, still, you get what you pay for.",

  "text": "I'm glad that I finally ended my term here. \n\nWhen I first signed up, they made me participate in a \"free training course\" so that I knew how to use the facilities properly. It was a great workout, but turns out it was just a sales pitch for me to sign up for a personal trainer. I was just out of college at the time and obviously did not have money for that sort of thing, but the guy made me feel really bad for choosing to just sign up for a regular membership.\n\nIn the beginning of my membership here, they also had almost an entire room meant for stretching out on mats. Within the past year, they changed it to a weight room and there is barely any room for stretching anymore. If the 3 mats they have are full, you can try stretching on the turf area, but if you are not a Thrive member you are not technically allowed to.\n\nParking here is impossible. If you plan on driving here, don't even think about it. There are about 12 parking spots for well over 300 members that go to his gym. \n\nThere was a lot of turnover among staff in the 2 years I went here, but for the most part they were friendly. Facilities were clean for the most part and the sauna was a nice perk. I was worried about ending my membership here because of all of the horror stories I have read on Yelp, but it was a very simple cancellation process with no fees or hassle.",

  "text": "Updated as of march 2015: Go to LA fitness behind if you plan on paying for full membership. TRUST ME ON THIS. You get more bang for your buck at LA. LA won't screw up your membership fees.They are cleaner with functional equipment. \n\nThis gym has dropped from 3 stars to 1 star. Grimy, broken or poor functioning equipment, error codes on most cardio machines, billing errors with extra charges every month.  At one point last month, 70% OF CARDIO MACHINES DIDN'T WORK. We all know that fat is shred with Cardio. The gym is tightly packed. On many of the machines that are functional, the cables catch and don't roll smoothly. The grips are old, saturated with sweat, ripped, flaking or out of place. Many of the pads are ripped. When machines are out of order, it makes sticking to a routine very hard.  \n\nWhen I wrote my first 3 star review 6 months ago, the owner emailed me about how he can help me accomplish my fitness goals. Whats sad is I had complained to him in person 2 weeks prior to my review. My complaint was \" I don't know how to use the equipment for optimal results, use proper form or pick a noobie routine. My free trainer session was a boot camp sales pitch that injured me and did not help. I just need a little guidance.\" His face 2 face response, \"Well we cant help you. That's how personal trainers make their money.\" \n\nI get it, but damn, don't add to my failure. Be a human and passionate about fitness, give me a pointer. \n\nSince then, I have decided to go late evenings, when my husband goes. Hubby knows about body building and the gym is empty. Since then, I am accomplishing goals. I have shred 20lbs and 5% body fat. \n\nNOTE TO OWNERS: You successfully re-branded the facility, but now that you have reeled in a BUTT LOAD of patrons, time to redirect your focus. Time to manage what you have and focus on the regulars. Where is your presence? You only have ONE FACILITY. Treat it like your baby. Your employees just hang out all day! The cats away, the mice are playing!\n\nIts such a small facility, it needs to be deep cleaned nearly daily, not a MONTHLY deep clean. You have less than 2 feet between majority of your machines. Smaller space = Traps more sweat/dirt.  Smaller facility= Machines will need more maintenance due to higher use load. Get more transitional weights. Make sure it's even for all free weights. I requested a kettle bell 2 months ago. No word back. It was working miracles for me and some other girls..You have 5lb and 10lbs...You expect someone to jump to 50lbs?  \n\nMake a bigger point about GYM ETIQUETTE. You have idiots setting laptops on benches, while doing lunges across your TINY walkways. People leave HEAVY weights on machines that people can't lift and change it out. Your employees don't ensure that either. Idiots set their bags on a machine while they go and hog 2 other machines. People are tripping over gym bags left in walkways. Idiots hog the newer equipment, doing who knows what on their phones.\n\nMyself and other regulars would make a bigger effort in wiping down the machines after we use them, but WHY? I don't see any employees wiping them down at the end of the day and by the time I am in the gym, the sweat stain is penetrated on the equipment and your alcohol water solution, and cheap unabsorbant paper towels wont cut it. \n\nInstead of hanging out with friends at the front desk on off time, employees should walk around and check on struggling patrons. That obese woman on the treadmill that will eventually cancel since she hasn't gotten results. Spoting that man who is bench pressing an insane amount of weight and might get injured if his elbows don't come in more. Me: A TALL idiot left six 45lb weights above head level for me to remove. (5'5 woman). A dip machine on set on HIGH resistance, and and two extra 45lb weights left on it. I removed the weight and and almost got face slapped by the platform and almost dropped the weight on my foot from the scare. LIABILITY!\n\nLastly, your trainers/employees really make your gym seem like an uncaring place. When the owners were around they went above and beyond (loved it!)  If they see someone using poor form, or improperly using equipment, then SPEAK UP. Show you care about patrons and are enthusiastic about spreading tips for the well being of others, eventually, they will seek them out and fork over $350 a month to use their services.\n\nI get that some people may become needy,but if someone is doing something wrong, guide them, say your welcome and walk away.  Not only that, it's a liability if someone is injured while a trainer is a few feet away simply WATCHING you self destruct (blond buff male trainer)\n\nFit360 is in worse shape now, than when Family Fitness Center owned it. That must mean something to you, after all your efforts re-branding. \n\nFitness 360 is a FITNESS CLUB...The definition of club: (n) association or organization DEDICATED to a particular interest or activity.\n\nShow ownership and DEDICATION. Both owners AND employ",

As a tried and true member of the 'sit on the couch and watch movies' crowd, Rocks and Ropes has been a fun and interesting place to trick myself into a 'workout'. \n\nI love that each time I come there's a mix of new and old routes. It's great being able to really see my progress (finally got up a 7+!) as well as have something new to try out.  They rate their climbs on a tally system where everyone who climbs a new route can rate it, which is great, but leads to a bit of variation between similarly rated routes. It still makes for a great workout though and you can push yourself to try something a little more difficult each time. \n\nAfter coming here a couple times, my boyfriend and I sprung for the punchcard deal where you get 10 anytime entries + rental. They also have monthly memberships with discounted student, military and family/couple rates as well as a 2-for-1 beginner package for 30 dollars which includes rental and an intro class to climbing for two people.",

You spend half the time running and sprinting and climbing and walking backwards on the treadmills (you will love/hate \"dynamic mode\") and the other half doing core, legs, arms with various weights, bands, etc until the point of exhaustion.  3-4 times a week is probably all most of us mortals can handle.  The locker rooms are clean and have showers which you will definitely need if you plan on going anywhere afterwards because you will sweat a lot (they turn on heat lamps when the class starts to elevate the temperature). The instructors are knowledgeable and motivating with good music. If you like it, the best deal is to buy the packages.  Plan your visits to make sure you are working different body parts and having different instructors.  This is just as good as having a personal trainer at a fraction of the price.",

  "text": "Clearly not made by actual climbers. The bouldering section has almost zero vertical almost all overhang. 17 bike racks (not a single one used) but almost no place to sit and chill. The climbs are CLEARLY underrated. I climb v5 usually and couldn't even get up a v2 there. Then the holds and footholds are super slippery and have clearly been up a LONG time. Climbs are pretty dangerous too. No good and safe downclimbs. No wonder no one is in the boulder section. And then NO SHOWERS?? Like I'm used to showers with shampoo and conditioner and fresh towels AND saunas. Not good guys.\n\nThis is what they just messaged me. Way to embrace feedback. Like they are accepting NONE of it hahahaha. \n\nAnnick- ANNICK: WAY TO ADDRESS YOUR CUSTOMERS. I FEEL LIKE AT SCHOOL.\n\n  First of all, we appreciate all feedback and we are sorry you didn't find the shower during your visit to our gym (kind of scratching my head on that one since there are showers in both bathrooms). ANNICK: THERE IS ONE MEASLY SHOWER HEAD LIKE IN THE CORNER WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S THERE ON ACCIDENT WITH NO SHAMPOO, NO TOWELS NO NOTHING.\n\n  Rocks and Ropes has been in existence for almost 30 years.  We were one of the very first climbing gyms in the country.  Last August we closed the gym for 7 months and went through a complete renovation and expansion, so without a doubt there are a few things we are still working out - seating being one of them.  I'm curious how you came to the conclusion on your visit that our gym was \".... not made by actual climbers.\"  Do you have specific things you could point to that earned us this designation, ANNICK: BECAUSE IT IS NOT THOUGHT THROUGH FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A CLIMBER. LIKE NOT ENOUGH ROTATION OF CLIMBS, NO PLACE TO PROPERLY SIT, BUT 17 BIKE RACKS THAT MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL. ADDITIONALLY AN ELECTRONIC CLIMBING WALL THAT NOONE KNOWS HOW TO USE NOR ARE THERE INSTRUCTIONS ETC or was that just a great intro line for a Yelp review?  ANNICK: WOW WAY TO ASSUME THE WORST. We have had the same ownership group for most of our nearly 30 years, and we all climb regularly - indoors as well as outdoors. \n\n  Regarding the angle profiles in our bouldering area, your assessment is simply incorrect.  Our entire free standing boulder ranges from slab to slightly overhung.  We also have nearly vertical terrain at both edges of our large bouldering cave.  This makes up roughly 40% of the entire bouldering area that ranges from 5 degree slab to 5 degree overhung. ANNICK: FAIR. FELT MORE LIKE 5%.\n\n  Regarding the route rotation, it's about 8 weeks, a timeline which serves the Tucson community well.  Sorry if you found the footholds to be less than fresh, but if you have been to many other climbing gyms you probably understand that rotation varies from gym to gym based on what is best for each facility and community.  ANNICK: RIGHT AND YOUR ROTATION IS DEFINITELY BELOW AVERAGE OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND I TRAVEL THE COUNTRY A LOT AND GO CLIMBING EVERY 2 DAYS.\n\n Regarding grades: these vary greatly depending on where you are climbing and the most any facility can strive for is consistency within itself.  We're sorry if you were unable to crush at your normal level, but as someone who has climbed in most of the gyms in the San Francisco area and many across the country I can tell you that the grades in the Bay Area are 'soft.'  ANNICK: AGAIN WAY TO ACCEPT FEEDBACK. ESSENTIALLY YOU ARE SAYING HERE THAT I HAVE BEEN TRICKED AND LIKED IT BECAUSE IM VAIN. GOOD ONE. ALSO I DONT LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO BUT AGAIN WAY TO ASSUME. In the indoor climbing industry this is called \"vanity grading,\" which is aimed squarely at making customers happy.  I will be the first to admit that this is something we have struggled with. ANNICK: SO THE ONLY THING YOU ARE ADMITTING IS THAT THE OTHERS ARE BEING AT FAULT. GREAT.\n\n  Lastly, we do read our reviews and we do discuss them internally with our management team.  We respond to the good and the bad alike.",

We never received a call back to even confirm there were slots open. I decided to come early today before the class started to get him registered. I filled out all the forms to then be told the class is full and there were no other 5pm options for his age group. I would understand if this was the only contact we had made but to not return phone calls and then also let me get through the paperwork process {when I communicated what class we wanted before taking said forms} is just not okay. I got to leave with a crying child and upsetting his friend as well. Please work on your communication skills and procedures.",

  "text": "I like Barry's a lot - its plush facilities with free Malin+Goetz products, the motivational workout space (mirrors are a tiny detail, but make a big difference; being able to see yourself working out is actually a great motivator, who knew?). It's terrific cardio with some strength, but I wouldn't say that it's the hardest weights workout I've been to (that honor goes to SHED in Belle Meade). It's more of a great all around workout.\n\nThe class is 30 minutes of high intensity treadmill intervals with 30 minutes of weight exercises to break it up. Even though I already spin and run on a regular basis, I still think the treadmill intervals here are awesome. The trainers push you to sprint faster and run longer than you thought you were capable of, and I feel like my cardio fitness has gotten even better with these drills. \n\nThe floor workouts that make up the other half of the class are just fine; there aren't any recommendations for weights, so you pick what you're comfortable with, and that can often end up too light. The exercises themselves are standard - i.e. squats on leg days or overhead presses on arm days. Since you're only spending half the class doing them, and there's a lot of time lost to transitioning from treadmill to grabbing weights to settling down on the mat, the weight half of the class isn't as hard as, say, hour-long strength-focused class. If Barry's weren't on ClassPass, I'm not sure I'd choose to come here for my weights days.\n\nWhile some people find Haley \"unapproachable\" and \"unfriendly\", she is my favorite trainer. She's professional, knows just what to say at the right moments to encourage you to go a bit faster or add a tiny bit more incline, and her playlist is super energetic. I only go to classes with Haley because I find myself doing so much better in her class. \n\nFacilities are perfect and fully stocked. Two showers in the bathroom, with Malin+Goetz products, free towels and electronic lockers. I've never used it, but the Fuel Bar apparently serves delicious post workout protein smoothies. There's free parking right across the street, but it's a bit annoying. It's free for 60 minutes, but anything beyond that up to 2 hours costs $4. If you like to arrive a little early and warm up on the treadmill like I do, that means you'll have to run out at the last 10 minutes of class to renew your free hour's worth of parking, then run back in to finish the class.",

I thought \"oh boy another waste of money/uniform that we will pay for and not go \" he couldn't wait till it opened up, I ended up joining too and I'm so glad I did.  \nTrust me it's not just a UFC gym, they have weights, treadmills, other exercise  1equipment, classes and its not like other gyms where you can only participate in limited classes. The Xbox1 has never been ignored this much. We come to the gym at least 4 times a week and on weekends when we can. Coaches Kelly and Johnny, Leslie have boxing and kickboxing classes, each one has a different style and that's what I love the most! \nDave and Mimi are the owners and are always happy to help in Any way they can, as the rest of the staff as well. \nWhat are you waiting for ?

  "text": "Hands down the BEST gym in the Reno/Tahoe area. I might be biased but I speak only the truth. \n\nI have been a member for at least 5 years, maybe even longer and I have never had one bad day nor have I had to fight for space. SouthRac has definitely done a lot of improvements in their facility and every year they get better and better. \n\nSouthRac has other businesses inside its facility, so depending on what you're looking for, this place can be a one-stop-shop for wellness and fitness. There is a salon, acupuncturist, massage therapist, metabolic testing center and much more.\n\nI typically come in during lunch hour M-F since I work around the area, but lately I've been coming in around 2pm to stay away from the \"resolutioners crowd.\" Don't get me wrong, this place is HUGE that it never really feels \"busy\" in there. But I do enjoy the quieter time of the day. Cardio machines are located upstairs which overlooks 2 basketball courts, an indoor track, 2 racquetball courts, circuit weight training machines, open astroturf and the recently added incline ramp -- Shaun T would say \"Amazeballs\" to this. Strength training machines, heavy weights are mostly upstairs and the Group Ex room as well. They have great Group Ex classes with great instructors. If you ever want to try Zumba, take Dulce or Veronica's class because you will be hooked. Just last year, they also became a Les Mills gym that now offers various Les Mills classes. My favorite area would be the \"Bat Cave\". I do a lot of functional training and the Bat Cave is the best place to do this. The Bat Cave is covered with rubber floors which is great for plyometric exercises. In the Bat Cave you'll find battle ropes, rowing machines (another favorite), spin bikes, suspension training equipments, pull-up bars, lifting platforms, GHDs and also free weights. There are numerous plyo boxes, and even agility ladders that is accessible to all the members. I also appreciate that there are plenty of foam rollers for the members to use. In short, whatever it is that you like to do when working out, SouthRac has it. So really, you wouldn't have any excuse as to why you are not working out here.\n\nStaff is very friendly, always greets you with your first name which I think is very personable and inviting. Locker rooms are well maintained with multiple shower stalls. You will also find a sauna in the locker rooms. I have never used the saunas so I couldn't tell you much about these.\n\nParking can be hard depending on the time of day you come so plan accordingly.  Or just think about it this way -- you're getting in your warm-up walking from your car to the entrance.\n\nAs you can tell, I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Try them out yourself and you will not be disappointed.",

  "text": "I'm not sure why I haven't reviewed this gym, because it's definitely worth mentioning!\nI've lived in several different (major metropolitan) cities, been a member at several (and I mean several) different gyms, and this gym is in my Top 2 faves. \n\nFirst, let's clear up any misconceptions...it's called UFC, and yes, there's an octagon in there, BUT it's not what you think. They've got 5 different fitness areas within the location: (1) cardio - elliptical, treadmill, tower and stair climber, (2) weights - dumb bells, benches and weight machines, (3) the octagon, which I have never stepped into, and don't ever plan on it, but if you do be sure to take off your shoes, (4) boxing bags - if you've never boxed for fitness (you and the bag), you are missing out! It's super fun and you will sweat bullets, and (5) functional training - prowlers, Bosu Balls resistance bands, etc.  So you have plenty of options. Take note of the fact that while there is an octagon, there, there's no MMA fighting.\n\nWhich leads me to the clientele. The people you see here aren't the typical meatheads that you're probably picturing. You know, the guy who has no neck, can't put his arms down because his lats are so big, he grunts obnoxiously during his workouts making everyone uncomfortable, and can't stop flexing in the mirror. The members come in all ages and shapes. You'll see a wide range of body types which just lends itself to the fact that this is an inclusive facility. There are people younger than me, and people MUCH older than me as well. So it's not intimidating at all.\n\nAlso, I have to mention that it doesn't smell...like AT ALL! Most gyms, with the exception of Equinox (and even then...some locations do), end up smelling like a dirty gym bag that's been sitting in a steamy locker room and then left in the sun to marinate after a bit. They've been open for a year, and it literally looks like a brand new facility every single time I walk in. If you've never been inside, just walk in once...I promise you'll be amazed at how pristine everything is. \n\nAnd as far as the staff...every single person I've spoken to has been so helpful, nice and extremely welcoming. Take my word for it...go check out UFC Gym, I can almost guarantee you'll love it! (I say \"almost\" because I don't know if your preference for fitness facilities sucks or not.) #NotAFightingGym",

It is near construction that makes it seem the road to its entrance is closed, but there's a place to turn and get to its entrance. Look for the billboard pointing you there.\n\nIt's a unique spot. A huge warehouse that has an indoor soccer field, basketball courts and volleyball. There's also arcade games, bouncy houses, bowling, darts and pool tables. And, if you do not want to do any of that you can belly up to the bar for hot bites and a beer.\n\nWe paid for pool. For $12 we got unlimited play and they gave us balls for both tables. The tables were okay for us but for those that take pool more seriously, be forewarned the tables aren't in great shape. Some knicks in the material and one is the sides smashed. My family includes two kids, 13 & 8, and we played several good games together. The staff also gave us several darts at no additional charge and we played a few games. Our boys also got a $12 game card for the games and air hockey table. \n\nWe decided to order some appetizers too. All of them were decent choices - basket of fries, mozzarella sticks and pretzel with cheese. Small sodas can be refilled for 50 cents or you can get a large cup and have unlimited refills. \n\nThe staff was friendly, from the person at the front booth to the bar manager and kids overseeing the arcade. \n\nIncrediplex is a bit run down in some spots like the couches near the bowling or the pool tables and bathrooms. It's a huge space and I can't imagine the money it takes to maintain it. But, it seems unique in what it offers and has been open 8 years hosting events and birthday parties. They also have a conference room in the back for rental.",

Package deals are fantastic, more than reasonable. And they offer late classes (7pm time frame), which is when I like to work out & have a crazy work schedule. \n\nThe instructors are all different and bring a great blend & variety, so regardless what you're looking for in a cycling class; you can find the instructor/class for you. All the classes are so different, always fun to go to a new class, will be totally different from your reg class. \n\nThe layout is fantastic! The bikes are very well maintained & even been upgraded a few times. They offer towels & keep it very clean with sanitizing wipes mounted on the walls. I especially like how when class starts the lights go off, music goes way up & the music video streams on giant screens while you're riding. You're not counting the mins for your workout to end or noticing what people are doing around you, your just in the zone. The instructors play music they like, not some cookie cutter aerobics cd bought from the 80's. Everyone has fun & gets a great workout. Plus location is great! Highly recommend it!",

Yes, this is a Barry's class, which is tailored towards more advanced work-out-ers, but if you tell someone who doesn't work out on a regular basis to do strange twists with a 12lb weight in their hand, and don't correct their form, they could get hurt.

  "text": "We've been to Incrediplex twice. The first time was AMAZING. My children had so much fun bouncing in the five bounce houses, navigating their way around the three-story maze, playing arcade games, jumping on the gravity bungee and just generally running around and exploring. It was also blissfully devoid of people, which always helps one have a better time. \n\nThe second time we visited, our visit wasn't as good. Their system was down, so we couldn't play any of the games, nor buy any food with anything but cash. (But who carries cash anymore? Not us, which meant we couldn't get any food.)\n\nBut despite the lackluster second visit, I'm still giving this place four stars because, to mangle the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem: When it is good, it is very, very good. This is a great place to take kids. They will have a good time.\n\nOne of the things that I like about Incrediplex is that they offer specials during the week. On certain days, you can get two-for-one wristbands, which allow kids to play in the bouncy house/maze area as much as they want. They also have a deal on certain days where they will match whatever you put on your game card, which you must use if you want to play any of the games or do any of the other attractions. (So if you put $20 on your game card, they'll add $20, so you'll have a total of $40 to play with.) \n\nAlso, they serve beer and wine! Hooray! Their food isn't too bad, either. I got a chicken tender sandwich, and it was pretty tasty.",

They made a smooth transition to the \"Bay club\" although raising the membership dues for no real reason applicable to us as members, it remains the best gym I have ever had the pleasure of training in. My review has to do with the success and dedication that my personal trainer, Martha Sundholm has instilled in me halfway through her instruction as a personal trainer. I achieved a body I was comfortable with at the gym but I seem to have reached a plateau I could not break through. Well let me tell you her credentials are ridiculous and she has done her best to discipline me through motivation, creativity and positivity to bring me through that slump and I found myself in. The rates they charge are completely justified in my eyes for her elite tutelage and spark as we plug along I don't dare say no or I can't. This is the best gym in town hands-down and Martha is the best trainer at The Bay club. And I can't leave out how engaging and friendly the front desk staff has always been. Join this gym there is no other option!",

Kate is genuine and cares about the health and fitness of everyone that visits the gym just as much as she cares about her own! \n\nThe gym is essentially in the basement of an older house but is kept welcoming and is well equipped. There doesn't seem to be any showers so keep that in mind because you will definitely need a shower after a workout here! \n\nI don't know about you, but one of my biggest fears with trying out a new gym is the possibility of being yelled at in stereotypical 90s movie drill sergeant fashion. You don't need to worry about that for one second at GetFit615. You will be encouraged to work your hardest and improve, but in a safe and encouraging environment. The gym, patrons, and instructors will make you feel welcome and open to asking questions. Not to mention, there are outings like rock climbing to encourage gym members to get to know each other! \n\nThe workouts are creative and challenging but still allow everyone to work at their own level without feeling like you're falling behind or not keeping up. You won't have a single second to get bored because the routine will keep you on your toes! The  times I have been the workouts consisted of cardio intervals with strength training such as burpees, kettlebell swings and the like. \n\nI highly recommend giving GetFit615 a shot. You will be in great hands!",

All of the good stability equipment to help you grow is located in the paid training area only. The purpose of holding the good equipment hostage is to get you to buy training. Im used to using that equipment to grow, its normal to have access available for all members in any average gym. \n2. Machines are broke and not fixed for long periods of time. Im looking at 3 currently and 2 have had a maintenance sign for over a month. \n\nThey recently moved the training area upstairs which makes the gym feel a bit cramped and smaller.

  "text": "My wife and I have been going to RowZone Rittenhouse for several months now and it is just what we were looking for.   Classes are always tough, but the instructors helped us immensely in getting started.  Neither of us had rowed before and both of us were starting from a less-than-perfectly-fit condition.  Not only did they make sure we knew the proper technique for both the rowing machines and the exercises done in between rowing, they have gone out of their way to suggest modifications for some of the exercises if something is too intense for our knees or back.  We're now going to Laura's class 3 or 4 times a week and I sometimes go to Chris' class on Saturdays as well.  Classes are 45 minutes so they fly by and they have classes early enough on weekdays that we can fit them in before work.  \n\nWe really appreciate how easy it was to get started and how thoughtful they've been to watch out for us during the classes and make sure to provide alternatives if an exercise doesn't work for us.  \n\nThere are a lot of regulars so there is a real sense of community, but there are also always new folks joining and it is nice to see how Laura and Chris get them up to speed and how other class members encourage them.\n\nThey have a bunch of different plans and often run specials.  At one point we were on a six week plan and I misremembered when it ran out and unnecessarily bought another pack.  I never would have noticed, but the owner did and emailed me to let me know and refunded me for the new pack without me asking.",

  "text": "This fitness center is okay. It has everything it needs. Nothing too special about it. A while back, a personal trainer named Kyle asked me to write a review and mention his name and he would give me a free workout. As soon as he said that, I was honestly a little sad. He seemed genuinely interested in my health and fitness journey. Well, here's my review, there's his name, and I 100% would decline a workout from not only him. He asked me about the review again after not following up with him and then two other trainers approached me in a similar manner. They weren't rude necessarily, but it just didn't feel right. After this incident, I started working out at Undisputed Boxing Gym and learned what a real gym (yup..no a/c or fancy pools and saunas) felt like. Trainers there literally just walked around, asked very politely if they could help me with my form, learned my name, and asked for nothing in return. I was so inspired by this staff that I am now a nutritional sciences major. I feel so awesome and independent my fitness journey now and I'm not afraid to ask for help at that gym. I still go to LA Fitness sometimes, because it's on a family membership plan, but I feel really really awkward around trainers at this gym. \n\nI feel like I'm definitely more knowledgeable in the gym, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with getting help from a fitness professional. In fact, I would encourage you to approach an LA fitness coach. This was just my experience. If I were new to a gym and read a review like this, I would feel more confident in knowing details about a place and people I'll be spending my time around.",

This LA Fitness, like most of them, is in a shopping area with other establishments, which makes parking a hassle at times. The facility is all on one level. To provide you with a visual, once you walk in, you have the front desk immediately in front of you, Kids' Club to your left and cardio machines somewhat to your right behind the front desk area. Most gyms have cardio machines which have their own TVs on the machine. This particular LA Fitness has not caught up yet. \n\nAs you walk further in, the sales reps desks are to your left and if you look closely, you can also see the pool. Continue walking and you'll pass workout machines on your right, a juice bar on your left and what seems like a full length basketball court near the locker room at the back of the facility. \n\nNow, let's get to the workout equipment and free weights. Everything seems dated and recycled. The dumbbell area is always a mess. The actual workout machines seem unsafe. I'm not sure if they actually have people monitoring the equipment. \n\nThe bathroom is disgusting. I've thought about working out at this location in the morning, but the thought of showering there makes me think otherwise.\n\nOverall, this location is definitely not my first choice. I'm not a fan of the layout. I'll workout here when I need to, but I'd much rather go to another LA Fitness location.",

I have little experience with medicine balls or free weights, and I have already learned so much just from my two classes.

I also emailed the manager & corporate regarding some issue with my complimentary week (the check in person \"wasn't able to fix\") and I still haven't heard back from anyone. I'm foregoing my complimentary week for other offers in town. There are far better places.",

  "text": "This has always been the only game in town. I was a member from 1998 to 2015. I see some of the negative reviews are older. Others just have no standard of comparison, clearly. Free coffee and cream, for instance, you will never find at Equinox. I miss the old cafe of course (and bar); in the 1990s, I ate here more than anywhere else in town. \n\nSince I left, they put a million at least into the locker rooms. Indoor was always a smaller room (with an oddly large dry sauna). And hallelujah! The boys and girls switched. Our locker room (\"outdoor\") was so much smaller than the guys' room. They also had a bigger steam room. \n\nIt's just beautiful. Same lockers as Equinox (no more padlocks, woohoo). The flooring is fantastic. \n\nAlso, thankfully, someone decide that the orange in the weight room adjacent to the locker rooms was a bad idea. Some orange remains in the boot camp room but it's fine. \n\nCardio upstairs is SO much brighter.  I remember when that room was a cave. \n\nThe treadmills are by the left-most squash court. Star Trac is a brand of treadmill with which I am unfamiliar. I'm a fan. They even have one of those treadmills for marathoners. Woodbine or something. I'm not a fan but the variety is excellent. \n\nSince I joined on New Year's Eve, I've never seen over 15 people at the club. The whole club! \n\nI know some people are sad that classes were closed but they're open now in a tent by the parking lot. I never took classes so it doesn't matter to me. \n\nI also am baffled by the complaints about price. At 159/month, it's less than the Bay Club (LA/SF) and wayyyy lower than Equinox. The same cleaning people are there (plus some new ones) and no one could possibly say anything negative about these lovely humans. \n\nThe managers and desk people are all new since I left. Terrific youngsters at the desk. They removed the Power Plate (a drag) and one girl at the desk was quite indifferent/unable to answer questions. Big deal. I don't need every person at a business to be perfect. \n\nThe pool is wonderful.  Best pool in America I've swum. The view of the lemon trees and the trees over the parking lot feel like home to me. I cannot begin to guess how many miles I've logged in this pool. Only when you move to NYC do you really appreciate the length of this pool. I think it's 68 lengths to a mile (about 5 alternate side strokes). So nice not to have to turn around constantly. Jacuzzi jets work---always. \n\nThere are no towels right now. That's a drag but you get used to it. (The Bay Club has towels so this is not a Newsom issue.) Steam and sauna closed but everything else open, indoors and out. \n\nI think SB people just don't know how good they have it. When you move to New York you really do appreciate just how excellent a club this is. And it used to be more country bumpkin. It's quite sleek now .\n\nCody is a terrific personal trainer (who started at Williamsburg Equinox). I got a free session when I joined. The initiation was just $199 at Xmastime. \n\nThe 1 star review is absurd and should be removed. It's a club. Of course you have to be a member. \n\nI joined for 12 months (to get the $159 rate). Originally I had intended to be here 9 months and it worked out about the same for the contract and non-contract. \n\nBut I was expecting the club dues to have jumped at least to $199, so I was overjoyed to find out that even after all the money to renovate the locker rooms, the rates stayed where they were. \n\nAlso, while LA clubs were closed, SBAC was open. They deserve ALL the gratitude in the world for this. Again, Santa Barbarans just don't know how good they have it in the gym department. New York opened gyms 9/2 but LA has been closed except for gyms with outdoor space. \n\nI love this club. The minute I walked into the locker room, I smelled the familiar scent of cleaner. A flood of memories washed over me. I don't know what cleaner they use but every gym should use it.",

I'm sad that I'm leaving it because I've recently moved.  It is really nice and yes it is expensive but you got a lot with that membership.\n\nThey recently completed a complete overhaul to the men's showers which is cool.  It's not that they were bad before but I can see how they needed the upgrade.\n\nI did spinning classes, boxing, circuit classes, pilates, swimming and general weight training.  I even tried yoga a couple of times which was awesome because it was in a private yoga studio, not a room with the lights dim.  The yoga studio was tranquil and even though I ended up hurting myself, I still enjoyed it.  I just don't think I'm the yoga type.\n\nThe website went a bit wonky from time to time when I tried to look at class schedules.  That's a minor complaint in my book.  I was able to take advantage of a special offer when I joined so I beat the initiation fee which is outrageous by the way.  Still, they offer specials and will let you train for a few days to see what you think of it.\n\nI really liked working out here and I hope that a gym near my new place will be even half as good as the bellevue.  If it's convenient and you want to pay for it, you will enjoy it.",

I joined his online 6 week challenge with a number of other guys (all who had different goals from losing weight to staying healthy, to building muscle and everything in between). Will had advice and tips and help for everyone no matter what their goals and helped keep the group engaged with multiple check ins per week to see how everyone was doing.\n\nI had never been able to consistently go to the gym before because I would lose motivation or burn out but Will's program helped keep me engaged and hold me accountable. He lays out a very easy to follow process and allows you to actually create a LIFESTYLE rather than just a fad diet or workout plan. He helps to create a mindset of something that can really change your life. \n\nI lost 8 pounds in 6 weeks under this program and learned so much more about nutrition than I had ever known before. If you are an experienced health/fitness goer who just needs a little push or someone who has no idea what you are doing, Will's program is definitely for you! If you feel like there is a plethora of information out there and you are overwhelmed or confused, that's how I felt going in and Will helps to simplify it and really help you out. Highly recommend Will for trying to reach any of your fitness/nutrition goals!",

  "text": "Cons: \n\nVery strict policies. Read the fine print. \n\nOne day I had completed a workout and got into the locker room only to find that they had plumbers just started working on both showers after a class in November. They could have had them work on only one shower at a time or wait until after everyone had left the locker room. \n\nAlmost impossible to understand the instructions over the loud music. If you are new or don't attend regularly, you may be completely lost. \n\nPros: very clean studio and great workout. Easy attached parking. \n\nNOTE: BB studios must be independently owned. Pricing is different depending on location and you can't share passes between studios.",

  "text": "The Sporting Club at the Bellevue was easily the best gym that I visited in center city while I was deciding where to get my gym membership. The location is a bit quirky, on the 8th floor of a parking structure, but the gym itself is very spacious. \n\nThe membeship staff were very helpful in getting me set up, the shoe-shiner across from the membership office is very nice and good at his job, the gym includes an indoor pool and basketball courts and ellipticals for days... the list goes on!\n\nThere are 4 floors for exercising- the first floor is the locker rooms, showers, pool, and cafe/restaurant. The second floor has the boxing ring, squash courts, a basketball court, and aerobics rooms. The third floor is the main fitness gym, with a lot of workout machines, ellipticals, treadmills, rowing machines, and free weights. The top floor is a baby version of a track, where 12 laps around the area equates to 1 mile.\n\nThe people here are generally friendly (except when the basketball games get super competitive). I don't feel like I'm being judged while I work out, which is a big plus, and signing up gets you a few discounts and perks for personal trainers, which is nice.\n\nLastly, the locker room is pretty nice as well. There are hundreds of lockers, and you can pretty much find every essential item that a locker room needs. \n\nI've been really happy with my decision to join the Sporting Club at the Bellevue, and I'd encourage anybody looking for a gym in center city to strongly consider this gym. The higher price is justified in my opinion, and they often do deals where you get 1 month free when you sign up as well!",

I must say, first time I tried power sculpt I thought I was going to die.. Had to build up my strength for sure to ease into this class but now it's my favorite.  It's definitely most intense of them all and least like yoga so if you want more traditional yoga try the hot power fusion or C2. I love the music, the facility is beautiful and I like this studio because it's not as crowded as the downtown one and parking is much better.",

  "text": "Ok, so as far as the classes, the cleanliness, the amenities - five star. \n\nHowever, they get 2 stars from me for everything else. I clicked on a link for a promotion on FB - 30 day challenge! How exciting! I needed the accountability and support. I spoke with Mandi, who encouraged me, offered me a first class free, and really kept on me about getting me in and started. All good. I paid the $149. First red flag, she had always wrote me back promptly (text message), but when I saw on my account that there was an auto monthly renewal- I wrote back and heard nothing for over a day. I went in for my next ride, and spoke to someone else about this being a one month promotion. \n\nThere is NO benefit to the one month challenge that I paid $149 for only to see the price go down to $99 within a few days. I asked for the remainder to be credited to another month and was told no. Not only told no, but that girl never spoke to me again - even in passing. There are no extra perks- I was told there was a Nutrionist coming to speak - she came, but just set up a table and advertised her products. Nothing extra for the challengers - I never met another challenger. I wasn't encouraged to keep coming and I actually stopped. It's just a marketing ploy - I was bamboozled. I wouldn't encourage anyone curious to try the challenge - you can just pay the $99/month and follow their social media for all the happenings. I don't blame Mandi at all - I'm sure the promotion came from corporate- just sharing my experience.",

  "text": "I love working out at this gym!\n\n I've have had wonderful experiences with my trainers at City Fitness, Rittenhouse. I've been a member of the gym for over 2 years and I've had a personal trainer for about 8 or 9 months. They've changed the way I work out completely. The program is called \"Thrive\", and I've done just that. I'm able to work out on my own and am confident knowing what muscle groups to focus on and which set comes first to get the most out of my workouts. I train with Allissa H., and she's wonderful. I'll tell her exactly what I need and she tailors my workouts to fit those needs (she's rather easy on the eyes and that helps too). I work very well with a schedule, and sometimes I need to cancel due to other priorities. Allissa has never treated me as if I was a floating client and she always fits me into her schedule. She has never cancelled on me and she is always on time. You do workouts in a small group, with your trainer walking you through each set of workouts. There is a definite method to the madness. Stretching and warm up are followed by power, and then two sets of strength training. The trainers are all very friendly. They always smile and say hello when I pass them; as if we were friends or I was previously a client. Alas, it's always a great experience here. This is why I probably go every day.",

So we waited until they finally opened up to do a 3 day trial. But honestly a 3 day trial is nothing they should offer a month free to try it out so u have enough time to try out not only the equipment but the classes as well. we tried 3 days it wasnt enough to decide on commiting for a entire year. i dont like contracts and feel others dont wanna be stuck for a year in a contract because if after a few months if your not happy your gonna be stuck i think they should do away with contracts more people would sign up if it was like that.\n\nThe gym is beautiful inside they have a theater room with bikes and treadmills that is a great edition that other gyms dont offer. Also they have a protein shake bar which is awesome. they offer many flavors to choose from. i did not sign up for the gym but you should give it a try maybe it will fit you. I would like them to offer a free month trial and no contract that would fit my lifestyle better but until then i will continue Planet fitness",

I mean, yes, please swiftly swim to my drowning child in high tops!\n\nAll in all, it's a good facility that offers a lot of options for working out or playing with the family. Compared to other cities, the Indy Y's are about as low cost as you can get--membership fees fluctuate depending on the city in which they are located. It's good bang for your buck.",

From the filthy locker rooms full of hair and water damage, to the loud 90's faux punk music blaring in the locker room to the shitty pool that is out of service constantly because they have no one on staff capable of maintaining it.  The good is that it opens very early, the pool is 25 yards and is kept to a temperature that makes swimming laps at least possible. I also like the crowd of women who come early (I'm told the place is essentially a whorehouse if you go in the evening.) The bad is just about everything else.  I really wonder what their insurer would do if they knew that this joint allows people to swim in the pool completely unsupervised with no lifeguard on staff at all every single morning from 5 am to whenever a lifeguard gets there sometime later in the day after 7 or 8 or so.  Also, on numerous occasions I've gotten there and no one has showed up to open the place.  Once on a weekend there was a crowd of about 50 people in the parking lot waiting for someone to show up; I finally gave up after about 45 minutes of waiting that day.  It's really unbelievable.  The place is so poorly run and so shoddy it kills me to pay them every month, but sadly there is nowhere else to swim.  As soon as the new YMCA opens, I am OUT of that hell hole.",

  "text": "I purposely avoided joining City Fitness prior to their opening and immediately after because I knew there would likely be some hurdles to overcome. Judging by the early reviews, I was right in my decision. But now that they are in their third month, things seem to be flowing smoothly. I've been a member for two weeks now and I'm very happy with my decision to make the switch from my old gym to this one. \n\nFor starters, the facility is brand new. That means everything is clean, machines are new, nice locker rooms, etc. The two-story layout is interesting and the hallway downstairs is a little tight but after a few trips to the locker rooms after using the back staircase, I feel like I know where everything is located. \n\nEveryone on the staff is super friendly. That's important. You don't want to join a gym and feel awkward. I've been greeted with friendly hellos or goodbyes every time I've gone so far. The towel service is great, and there are always plenty of fluffy hand towels available.  \n\nI purchased the highest tier membership, which includes all classes and access to the We Fit classes. This membership was only five dollars more than my previous gym, and now I'm getting access to the circuit training classes I used to seek outside of my old gym (an extra expense I'll no longer have to worry about). I took advantage of my free personal training session and liked it enough that I have signed up to train with David once a week. Since I'm currently training for Broad Street, I'll probably stick to the treadmills and my PT for the next couple months, but I look forward to trying the classes and We Fit after the run. \n\nBottom line, I'm really happy City Fitness finally made it to the neighborhood!",

  "text": "My husband and I went through a short but intense cycling phase and didn't enjoy our experience at Soho. Firstly, they separated our bikes after they told us we'd be riding together. That didn't start our experience well at all. Then we went to the extremely small locker area with one flimsy bench for everyone cycling (i.e., dozens of people) to use. It was so cramped and obviously didn't smell pleasant with so many bodies crushed together changing shoes.\n\nThe classroom is large, but there are one or two load-bearing poles that make some bikes less desirable than others. The floor is so slippery with the cycling shoes on. I almost witnessed a pregnant woman slip and fall face-first. Thankfully, she caught herself on another bike. \n\nThere were technical issues throughout the class, with music not playing for various reasons. The instructor had to go to the back several times, which killed the energy every time.\n\nWe had been to CycleBar a lot before trying Soho, so we naturally compared everything (as is the nature of Yelp) and concluded that Soho didn't have any positives over CycleBar, which has a large locker area with multiple restrooms, carpet throughout the studio to negate slipping, stadium seating in the studio (so you're not staring at someone's butt crack the whole time), snacks, cold and tepid water dispensers, zero technical malfunctions in the many times we've gone, much more parking, and the list goes on.\n\nAfter the Soho class ended, we headed to the locker area and discovered children playing with tablets and toys on the one available bench. Again, we maneuvered through dozens of people to get our stuff together and return our shoes. Just not a comfortable experience. A staff member asked us how class went. When I said it had been \"okay,\" he didn't inquire further, which indicated to me that nobody there really cares to improve the customer experience.\n\nI'm giving two stars instead of one, because the instructor and workout were fine. It was a decent workout, and we left sweaty. It was the first and last time we'll go to Soho. I definitely recommend CycleBar instead.",

  "text": "This one really disappointed me. I just moved to 15th and Reed st and was looking for a gym with a personal trainer.\nFirst I call their location on Wharton St which is a couple blocks from my house. The first thing I say is \"hey I was looking to speak to someone about memberships\" the person responds and says \"can you call back in like 15 minutes? Everyone's very busy right now\". I responded nicely no problem.\nIt was apparent they're location was busy if they asked me to call back, so then I thought hey let's just call and see if someone at the South St location can help me out because I work on south st a block away and it's a good chance I'll be going to both locations if possible. I call up and a very nice girl answers the phone and I asked the same question as I did the first location, she asked if I could hold briefly, which I did. She returns and says \"hey everyone's with someone right now can we have someone call you back\" I responded \"It seems like you guys are a little too busy for a someone who wants to be a new customer huh\" she responded telling me how they were slightly short staffed for it being a Tuesday night which I understood and was fine with, she than went totally out of her way to explain a few things about the membership and how it works and settled me for sure. She told me she would have Harrison they're lead guy give me a call back in 10 minutes which I was cool with because I didn't have plans for a couple hours. The time went by much past 10 minutes and I get a call from Harrison at 9 pm when I was already out with a couple of friends that I wanted to actually join a gym with. I gave a call back the following day and asked for Harrison, was put on hold and than told he was unavailable and he would call me back very shortly when he's done. I understand work is stressful and people get busy but for 2 of their places to be too busy to talk to a new member immediately makes no sense to me when it comes to a business aspect or a customer service aspect. I unfortunately don't know if I would sign up with city fitness at this point. I am going to check out other places in the area and go from there.",

The instructors are super knowledgeable and clearly spend a lot curating the workouts and playlists. Russell and Sho are fantastic and so passionate about the studio and clients. They also do a great job establishing relationships with local vendors like Sip N Glo. Classes are well priced, especially for Philly and there are lots of pre/post work classes as well as options for an afternoon sweat sesh. I highly recommend giving it a try!",

It also keeps getting better all the time!!\nWe (my wife and I) went to the same gym for about 14 years when we lived in NJ. It was hard to find a place we would be so happy with again. But when I first moved back to the city, i checked out a few gyms, but City Fitness felt right from the minute i walked in. Steph explained everything and showed me all around the place and (still makes sire all is great for us). I joined immediately and brought my wife in a few days later. I am there 6 days a week and couldn't be  happier. Love all the classes and the instructors are great. Analis, Carrie, Jackie, Katie, Chris, Chuck, Kelly, Dayna, Jacquie, Ted, Rachel and Christian are ALL awesome.  Very friendly people there from the girls behind the check in counter, the others in membership (who all know our names!!) to just about everyone there. Carl does an amazing job!!! Did i say i love this place???",

  "text": "I've been a member at this Oro Valley location for about seven weeks, and for the most part I've been very happy here. The gym is great: large, clean, friendly, and a wide range of ages and physical fitness. You can read the other reviews for that info. My review is going to explain why I'm not giving it five stars.\n\nThe main reason I chose this above other gyms was their childcare. The only way I was going to be able to workout was if I had someplace for my child to go. I thought the LAFitness Kids' Klub would be a great solution. Unfortunately, it's not. The large TV is on the whole time, and often very loud. They don't even play nature or science stuff on there; it's all Disney movies. I'd expected that a fitness club would understand the importance of having kids do active things and move their bodies. There is some play equipment there, but my son tells me that he was told not to climb on it because he would get hurt. Most of the time when I walk in there all or most of the kids are sitting in chairs up close to the TV, even the very youngest of them. The vibe in there is also quite negative; the workers seem depressed.\n\nIt makes me feel awful that here I am, trying to have a healthy lifestyle, but while I'm working out, my son is sitting there like a zombie. I try to rush through my workout to get him out of there as soon as possible, but it still makes me feel guilty. I'm really not sure how long I'm going to keep this up.",

They have not only changed a lot of my favorite classes to 5:30 PM (I'm sorry, but if you work, who the heck is making these 5:30 classes), but they also still call one of the classes \"cardio combat\" when it is not.  The girl who took Chuck's place is not a certified cardio combat instructor, so it is really misleading to continue to call it that.\n\nAls huge caveat: if you do get a membership here expect a few things.  1) They won't offer to print out your contract, so make sure you get one.  2) They will bully you into a personal training session, just like LA Fitness 3) They hit you with a ton of hidden fees and can change your membership fee at anytime without any advanced warning \n\nI go here simply because I love the cardio combat class that Chuck teaches.  If it weren't for him, I'd change gyms.",

  "text": "I love the idea of the Y and this is the only branch I've been to so I can only comment on this facility but as much as I want to love it, it definitely needs improvement. The cleanliness gets 2 stars at best. The floors in the yoga room, group fitness & the basement level room are filthy. My guess is they are almost never cleaned. It's difficult to do Barre because certain exercises require a sliding motion & you're sticking to the floor. The noise level in the yoga room is almost hilarious. During the rest period at the end of class you can hear every conversation from the locker rooms, toilets flushing, the bathing suit dryer spinning, the doors slamming, kids whining & screaming, you name it. The yoga room is too small & awkward with the amount of people they allow in. The last three classes were so tight we couldn't do several of the poses the instructor wanted to do because there wasn't enough room. People show up for yoga late, even 10 minutes into class & are allowed in a packed class where they force everyone to squeeze in even tighter disrupting the others practice to the point it's un-enjoyable. The instructor put up a sign yesterday at the beginning of class that said it was at capacity & three more people came in after several minutes completely ignoring the posted sign on the door. At that point the instructor should have asked them to not come in but I realize that might be awkward for them to have to do. \nThe parking lot is not planned well & most spaces are too narrow for most cars/SUVs to fit into forcing people to use two spaces. I was unable to get into my car one day & had to climb in from the passenger side when someone squeezed in too close & I injured myself climbing into the driver seat. I told the staff later & they had no response or follow up. Having said all this the staff is very friendly mostly & several of the longtime employees are really welcoming to everyone. The instructors are the best part of this Y in my opinion.",

After trying some of the TFW workouts in my personal sessions, I am now joining the TFW program full time. \n\nThe gym itself is clean and full of real gym equipment.

  "text": "In this city filled with yoga studios, running clubs, spinning, and other types of fitness places, I was really looking forward to the opening of CKO Center City! I love the energy of this place! The workout is a sweat fest, and it works out your whole body, both physically and mentally. You soon find muscles in all the right places, and during class your brain keeps telling you that you're not dying, so keep moving! Plus, the thought of going beast mode on a heavy punching bag does more for me than any workout that I've tried. It really is my new obsession. You learn and burn! Learn new combos, and burn off a gazillion (ok, I'm exaggerating, but it seems close to that number) calories at each class.  \n\nThe place has been open a little more than two months, and I've been to enough classes where I've experienced each instructor. All of them are OUTSTANDING and MOTIVATING, and each of them are different. Regardless, every hour you spend at CKO is worth it. I love that you go at your own pace and skill level, so don't feel that you need to kick higher or throw 10 more punches than the person next to you. You compete against yourself to do better, and at the end of class, you leave stronger and confident that the next one will be better than the last. You'll be planking longer, running faster, and throwing more powerful kicks and punches. \n\nFor those that are new, I highly recommend going to your first class 15-20 min early and coming with an open mind. You'll learn the basic punches and kicks with one of the instructors, and then you're all set to join the class for a fun workout! All the classes have the same format: warm up, lots of exercises on your core, work some combos on the bag, maybe 1-2 freestyle sessions, and then a cool down (you'll love the moment when they say starfish!). \n\nI love coming to my new \"therapy sessions\" because it relieves stress, and after a rough day at work, it's awesome to get angry and destroy the bag. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I'll learn to love burpees.",

I didn't like the layout of the cardio machines and prefer other machines to the Lifestyle brand that LA Fitness carries.

I have tried RowZone via class pass twice, and even in my short tenure as a customer, I have realized that the members of this gym are a community. Through the sweat and loud music, you hear members supporting one another and coaches cheering you to push just a little harder. \n\nWhat I like most about this gym, is it's a low key, no frills environment. Many of the classes I have done through class pass (while challenging and enjoyable) have been in super glamorous gyms, with loud music and DJs, dark lighting, etc.  I don't need to pay for the frills, just deliver a workout that's going to kick my butt. RowZone is exactly that, the room is lined with erg machines and there is an assortment of free weights available for exercises you do off the machine. There are lockers for your belongings and a fridge to keep your water cold for after the workout. \n\nRowing is a great full body workout, and the class is designed to get you on and off the erg. There are a few circuits for each class, some are AMRAPs, some are focused on the distance rowing. In addition to rowing, you work in some strength training using both dumbbells and body weight. It's high intensity with low impact. \n\nI have told a few people about this gym so far, and what a great feeling it is when you complete the workout! I'm hoping to bring my parents next time because I think they would really like the intensity without the impact on their joints!",

State-of-the-art cardio equipment (although there are no cross ramp ellipticals, which I love)\n\n4. Brand new machines (cardio and weight)\n\n5. Very nice and helpful staff\n\n6. No crowds whatsoever. I was there today, Monday at 530pm and I saw maybe 15 other people. Granted, they just opened two days prior but still, very weird. But at the same time, it was nice not having to wait on any machines or for a shower. \n\n7. Whirlpools in the locker rooms\n\n8. Has a child care center for the latchkey kids\n\n\n\nCONS\n1. Way overpriced. Not worth the $140 per month fee plus initiation fee.  I'd be ok paying $80 per month. \n\n2. Very, very small. Even seemed smaller than some good clubs I've been to. Also very weird because it looks huge from the outside. \n\n3. No swimming pool. Lifetime is known for their amazing pools but not even a kiddie pool in this one (although they have the aforementioned whirlpools in the locker rooms)\n\n4. Not a big variety of cardio equipment or weight machines. \n\n5. Not 24 hours like most Lifetimes\n\n\nThat's pretty much it. Like I said, very very nice club, but not worth the price. More pros than cons but the cons are pretty steep.  And I have a feeling if they don't lower that monthly fee, they won't be in business very long.",

  "text": "Have been working out here (almost) everyday :D. It is a big enough place where if some machine or equipment is occupied, there are many other stations you could do while waiting for people to be done. There are many young men and women here (some of which I believe are VERY good looking; but you know, see see no touch -- dang it, right? Unless...) Anyway, I signed up for the group fitness classes here, too, for summer II and those classes are great. From Spinning and Zumba, to Core and Yoga; there is bound to be something for everyone. I really love the Anusara Inspired Yoga -- it's very soothing and it targets muscles which I never knew (well maybe Anatomy class grazed over it) existed and it stretches and wakens it. It is awesome to me. Most of the time, when I come in the afternoon/evening times, there are a lot of people so choose your time wisely. If you want a particular machine, come earlier when no one is awake yet. :D But overall, this is very convenient for students, faculty and other members! There are so many little kids here for camp and swimming; so adorable. \nAll in all, if you want a place to work out and you go to school here (if not, you can be an alumni or know someone who goes here to get a great deal [so I've heard]) then why not use it? You pay for it in your tuition ANYWAY! :D \nSee you guys around!",

I have been looking for something for the last few years that would be: fun, engaging, challenging, a comfortable environment and a good workout. Impossible, right? One workout cannot be all those things?! Enter Lilly Steele Fitness! I was completely hooked after one Aerial Yoga class. Every class is fun, engaging, challenging and a good workout. The environment could not be more comfortable. With a max class size of 4, you get one on one guidance and every person I've been in class with has been super friendly. Lilly is delightful! She is encouraging and motivating. She encourages you to keep going, shows you the right way to do each move and I don't think I've seen her without a smile. \n\nThe classes I take on Tuesday and Wednesday are the highlight of my week.  \n\nI must include that I've had amazing improvement in some areas of tension and pain in my neck, shoulders and hips that I've been dealing with for years. I've spent literally thousands of dollars with various doctors in over the past two years. After less than two months of classes twice a week, pain is almost completely gone.  Best thing ever!\n\nI highly recommend! 6 Stars! 5 isn't enough. :-)",

  "text": "This gym is pretty decent.  It's small so just know that going into it.  I was used to PSC where there was a ton of different types of equipment so it took a week or so for me to adjust to a smaller gym.  The staff is very pleasant and is probably the best gym staff I have ever seen in my 15 years of being a gym rat.  The personal trainers actually look the part!  This isn't always the case at other gyms which has always been confusing to me.\n \nMy only complaint about the gym would be the use of the space on the upper floor.  It looks like they could fit more equipment (weight machines or free weights) on this floor.  Additionally, one room has a really nice set of circuit equipment in it and suspension training equipment in it but it is always occupied by the \"We Fit\" class.  It's a great class and I am sure the members who take it regularly love it but the class is given at 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm eliminating that entire room and all of its equipment during the busiest hours of the gym.  It doesn't make much sense to me to dedicate that room during those busy hours to a very small percentage of members working out.  The equipment in that room would relieve the wait times and overflow in the free weight room and the only other weight circuit.\n \nOverall the gym does the trick and I can get a good workout in.  Like I said, the staff is great which is sometimes hard to find in a gym.  I was told there would be a juice bar but there have been no signs of it yet.",

  "text": "This is my first impression upon starting a 7-Day Free Trial this morning.\n\nI went it about 7:20AM and waited around forever for someone to come to the unmanned desk. The fella who showed me around was very friendly and totally excited about the gym. Encouraged me to take advantage of all the classes offered, which I may start with AM Boot Camp tomorrow....hello 6:30AM (ugh).\n\nThis time of the morning wasn't too crowded -- plenty of available machines and lots of room on the stretch mats. I didn't do any lifting, but it seemed that anyone there had their choice of machines during the hour I was there.\n\nI went back again after work and while it was much more crowded, it wasn't overwhelming. I was able to get a treadmill right away and then a stationary bike. While it's cool that the treadmills have personal TVs, it's a bit much since they're so close to your face. The desk was manned this time around (more people working, so it makes sense) and the staff was again very friendly.\n\nI enjoyed my first day and hope the rest of the trial goes as well. I'm still not clear on where all the classes take place, but I definitely want to get involved in some of them. Good variety: yoga, boot camp, zumba, Indian dancing, spinning, and a lot more.",

I see that almost everyone sprays down the equipment after they use it. No one really hangs out on equipment just talking, obstructing you from using it. Staff is always professional and courteous. The only complaints that I have is the paper towel holder near the ellipticals is usually out and ladies who wear way too much perfume make me want to gag. It seriously makes me have a hard time breathing when they get on equipment right beside me. It smells like gardenia and old wooden musty closets. I wish they would put up signs asking people to refrain from having perfume or cologne on until after their showers .",

  "text": "I've been a member here for a little over a year. First the good.\n\nThis facility is beautiful. The architectural design is pleasant and well planned inside and out. The fitness center, which is the reason I joined, has high quality equipment and a nice selection of classes. Many of the staff and instructors here are friendly and helpful.\n\nThat said, there are some things that pull this otherwise nice facility down. Really down! The rules posted -  no cell phones in the gym, re-stack and don't drop weights, wipe down the equipment, etc... - are never enforced. People routinely use an exercise machine as a lounge chair to chat on the phone, text, talk to a gym buddy, or for some purpose other than exercise and are never spoken to by staff. Weights drop constantly and unnecessarily and I have never seen staff address this with an offender. Maintenance on the machines, like the bikes in the spin room, is wanting and mentioning this to staff seems ineffective. Several bikes have been in need of repair for some time.\n\nThen there is the behavior of some, and I emphasize SOME, of the gym-goers. While plenty of gym wipes are available, many lack the proper gym etiquette to use them. Profanity and stories about jail are not uncommon. Again, it's frustrating to have to ask a person to get off of a machine they are NOT using so you can use it for its intended purpose. People don't re-stack weights. People DO drop weights. Children often run about unsupervised (although staff does seem to address this when they see it). There is just a relatively high level of inconsideration and little knowledge of etiquette. \n\nOh...and the parking lot is too small and people seem to lack sufficient driving skill to take up only one spot.\n\nSo, why do I stay here? It's reasonably priced and is overall a nice place. But, with a little effort from the staff to not only post rules but to gently and kindly enforce them, this place could be so much nicer.",

  "text": "I jumped around gyms/health clubs quite a bit in the last 12 years since I moved to Philly from NY. I went to Sweat, PSC and finally joined The Sporting Club in April 2015. It's the best gym Philadelphia can offer, for now. Depending on what you want, I love most of the classes I go to. They have a wide selection but I have my favorite classes and instructors that I follow.  I highly recommend: Nathaniel who teaches Hatha is a really fantastic instructor who pays attention to your alignment (Hatha), Miko, Jen & Remi (Hatha and Vinyassa), Jamie is simply the best (hip-hop), Nicole is high energy combo Zumba/hip hop class too. Luis and Laura (Zumba), Emily (Boot camp) and Kristin (Pilates) classes.  They also have Aquafit, TRX, Spinnjng and Barre classes.  Kelli's Barre class is wonderful and Kristin's Pilates mat class will kick your abs! The studios are all hardwood floors and kept clean.  The towels are constantly kept washed, fresh and clean. Clean locker rooms, steam room, dry sauna and jacuzzi are wonderful amenities. The olympic sized pool is great with lukewarm water temp all year round but the cool ambient air can make it feel cold in the winter. The weight room is expansive & updated machines. You get all sorts of people that come to this gym - the lookers, the onlookers and wants to be looked at.  Of course there are the ones that just go & workout and doesn't care (that's me).  They also have a basketball court which draws all kinds of leagues but not necessarily the usual health club  members. They also have squash & racquetball courts.  The front desk people are nice, especially Chuck who greets most people by their first names! A plus for him. The sales staff are helpful...well its sales. Hannah Purbe who is the Group Fitness Director is awesome and responsive to our suggestions, if reasonable.  I also love their indoor running track, so kind to your knees. Its not Equinox (my gym in NYC) but the Sporting Club is as good as its gonna get as far as Philly is concerned. I wish they would replace those stinky carpets along the stairways that somehow soaks up the smelly sweat from people. The management & customer service seem to be more responsive these days and a bit better with communication.  Watch out though if you catch them on a bad day, they might give you the attitude or no response at all.  P.s. I ran into Bradley Cooper in the elevator one afternoon.",

And subsequent classes are not expensive, as far as spinning studios go. \nInstructors are very supportive and go out of their way to help newbies. \nThe class I took with Russell was a very tradition spin class...no weights or crazy dance moves on the bike...and it was solid. He comes out into the crowd to ride on empty bikes next to class participants which is super cool. \nGood music. I know some people mention in their reviews that it's loud but I found it actually quieter than I'm used to. \nSign up, reservation, and check-in process was super easy\n\nWhat to know:\nThis studio is not dark. This was strange for me and I realize now I prefer spinning in a dark studio. If you want closer to dark, sit in the back row along the back wall of the studio and not under the skylight or by the windows. \nThe spin bikes are ones I've used with a trainer but not in a studio before. They were fine but there's not a summary at the end of the ride of your watts/MPH which I'm used to seeing right on the console. \nThere's one bathroom with one shower. Plan to shower elsewhere. \n\nOverall, I really liked my class at Body Cycle. When I'm in Philly on business again, it'll definitely be my go to.",

  "text": "I just cancelled my membership - horrific customer service and terrible facilities.  I tried to use the baby pool with my little ones and they close the pool for camp 9-3:30 every day in the summer.  And even though I am a paying member and both pools were empty due to lunchtime for campers, they wouldn't let me allow my baby & toddler to use the baby pool for 20 minutes AFTER their front desk clerk told me it was open and I spent 20 minutes getting everyone into swim diapers, required plastic pants and swim trunks.  When I pleaded my case, they said that they couldn't do anything about it.  So I did - I took my money elsewhere.  \n\n\nThey told me it would take 60 days to cancel and I told them that if I got charged for a MINUTE more let alone 60 more days, I would file a complaint with the owner and investigate legal options.  \n\nI am a reasonable person but I am also logical and if a pool is empty and a member is standing there asking for 20 minutes in the BABY POOL you oblige.  No negotiating - you just oblige.",

  "text": "I'm more or less a casual novice exerciser, so I greatly appreciate this small, yet clean, efficient gym. As a night shift RN, timing and convenience is very important to me, and this place fits my lifestyle. I love the variety of exercise machines here from the treadmills to the elliptical, to the ab cruncher and weight training machines. The clientele I see here vary, from casual (like me) to who appear expert. I also love the clean bathrooms and small cubbies to put my things. Definitely feel at home here!",

  "text": "The best spinning studio in phila for a number of reasons. It's like flywheel without the pretense. Don't get me wrong I love a good flywheel class but body cycle is like it's less culty little sister - and there are no arm workouts which let's be honest makes sense (if you're going to work out arms do it separately not during cardio! though it is a welcome break from interval sprints). Body cycle shares a studio with yoga and barre classes which is nice but it's got its own little area in the back and doesn't feel too crowded. Classes are at convenient times for the most part but there aren't any early afternoon which has been frustrating occasionally. The teachers are phenomenal and I never get bored during class - Robbie is one of my favorites. A notable difference from flywheel is no shoes provided so you either bring your own cycling shoes or wear sneakers and use their shoe cages (which I have found to be almost as good as clipping in though serious cyclers would probably disagree). It's a great workout and you'll leave sweaty but happy.",

  "text": "Was in yesterday 5 pieces of equipment had out of order signs. Went to use the leg press and it was broken. When I reported it to staff I was told..\" yeah we know about it, but we are out of out of order signs.\"  The cardio theater is a wreck and hasn't worked right in a year and a half. The place is always a bit over crowded. The front desk staff is usually very nice. I have never been in that I wasn't at least greeted with a smile or told \"good bye\" when I left.  I've only encountered a few of the personal trainers... They don't seem friendly at all and one of them is actually kind of a jerk. If you like a good front desk staff... And that's all that matters for you it's a nice place. But if you actually want to work out I would not suggest it.\n\n\nUpdate: went back today and some of the machines were being repaired. For the second time I tried the audio app that is supposed to work with the cardio theater. It completely earns the 1.5 star review. The sound quality is bad and the TVs do not align with the app.  After the review. I was contacted by the front desk manager... like I said before. Top notch front desk staff.",

  "text": "From water bottles, bananas and lemon-scented hand towels to a USB charging port in every locker, this place has it figured out. Even my bathroom experience was top notch. These bathrooms have a full shower with all of the amenities! I can only imagine how long the line is for one of these in the morning. \n\nThe lobby was all that and a bag of chips (errr... apples), but the real star of the show was Chris, the instructor. Awesome music and color changing lighting kept everyone motivated. At one point I'm pretty sure water was flying! This class is unpredictable and competitive (you are seriously competing against your classmates). On the way out be sure to check out the apparel. Everything is so cute!",

  "text": "This review is for trying to use the gym as a guest for the day. I used to be a member here for several years, and since I was back in town I figured I'd stop by for the day for a 1-day visit. However, when I went to pay I was told the Day Pass price is $50?? As in 5-0, aka more than the cost of most monthly gym memberships for one day of working out. I thought that was a laughably high price, but the membership office confirmed it. \n\nTruly a terrible business model, since I have no problem spending $100+ on a monthly membership at a nice gym but you'd have to be nuts to drop $50 to go work out for a day. For comparison, Equinox in NYC charged $25 for a one day visit, so yeah.",
