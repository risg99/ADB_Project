It was a great smoothie, however the prices are really high at $7.50. I've lived in many juice friendly cities that have organic fresh juices and smoothies and this is by far the most expensive place I've tried. I'm not sure my wallet can handle frequent visits but for a splurge once in awhile, I'll  definitely come back.",

She, Kevin, & ALL the servers were FANTABULOUS!! We had SOO much fun pickin appetizers & drinks & the place was just buzzin with HAPPY! The food was AWESOME, even tho we'd never had many things on the menu, like Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Yellow Beet salad, & Pate'! The stuff we were used to like raw/fried/baked oysters, & crisped french baguette sliced was PERFECT! Oyster ACTUALLY tasted like OYSTERS...even the FRIED ones (they & the raw ones are part of Happy Hour fare, along with half priced cocktails & wine)! I kno this is LONG but it's worth EVERY WORD! I'd recommend this place to EVERYONE, from locals to tourists! THANK U guys for makin us feel SOO at home!",

When the nail tech was done it looked like the lady painted the nails, but just dropped a dollop of gloss on top and you can clearly see the separation between the coats.  She told me it was because my nail beds are darker, I said, \"I get pedi all the time, they have never looked like that.\"  The nail tech did offer to re-do them, but I was fed up and just wanted to go.  Ended up paying $30.00 for crap!",

We ate as much as we could, left the restaurant full and satisfied, but then spent the rest of the night sick. Very sick. Like stay-in-the-bathroom-for-hours sick. I am afraid that every time I think about fried seafood, I'll remember this experience and then promptly throw up. \n\nOther than the raging sickness that descended on our trip, the restaurant was just OK. Service was friendly but awkward (why did we have three servers?) and the food was good but nothing special. We certainly had better gumbo and seafood at other points in our trip (this was a pre-food poisoning opinion).",

Regardless, my latest visit is my last visit to Panda Express, if I can help it.\nI recently went to their newly opened restaurant on 96th St in the Meijer parking lot...I wasted my money, again.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken pao, and broccoli beef. They both tasted like soap. Honestly, this is the worst chinese food I have ever tasted. I threw most of it away. You only get two entrees and rice for almost $7. I can go to another chinese restaurant and get that along with a side and drink for that price.  In addition, I have determined that Panda Express tastes like plain, make-at-home chinese. In fact, I think I could do better than this. At least I have finally learned my lesson and know for sure that their food will never be improved. I am just really surprised that they get enough business to need to open another location.",

  "text": "On Friday night, I finally got around to trying out Virago in Lansdale for dinner and, more importantly, dessert. Husband and I split the vegan \"beef\" cheesesteak wrap. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'm dying to try the vegan buffalo chicken wrap. Virago offers a choice of whole wheat or gluten free wraps for any of their sandwiches. This place seems to be all about the gluten free options, with a few great vegan options thrown in the mix too.\n\nThe vegan cheesesteak was tasty, full of very mild, fried onions and peppers and a good amount of tasty Daiya cheese. If I had been more hungry, it would have been the perfect amount for a filling dinner. But I wasn't starving and I had to save room for an assortment of dessert. Our dessert was 100% vegan, as well; we split two cupcakes and a pastry. The pastry was a nut bar with caramel and chocolate chips, and it was delightful. The usual pecans were on top, but there were also some hazelnuts in there which was a delicious touch. The cupcakes, coconut chai and coffee chocolate chip, were just okay. The cake itself was a little crumbly and the frosting was a little overpowering. I will return because there are very few places in the burbs with vegan options and there are still a number of vegan options on Virago's menu that I have yet to try!",

  "text": "I'm originally from Atlanta, GA and have eaten at Longhorn Steakhouses for years.  I was very excited when I found out that one was opening in Tucson even though it is 45 minutes from where I live.\n\nSo today I decided to try it out.  I went by myself for a late lunch (around 1:30).  Walked in a was immediately greeted but had to wait a few minutes because I didn't want to sit at the bar.  My server, Amanda, came over and asked for my drink order and I ordered water with extra lemon.  She brought it back shortly but with only one lemon slice and quickly disappeared before I could say anything.  A little later she came back for my food order and when I gave that to her I again asked for extra lemons. \n\nThen I went to the restroom and when I came back by table had been cleared - no water or silverware and wiped down.  Someone who worked there was near by and I told her that my table had been cleared.  She apologized and told me that my water was \"right here\".  Right here was a large, round table full of dirty glasses and silverware.  I just looked at her and she said \"I'll go get you a new water\".  While she was gone to get the water a hostess came up and asked me \"did someone seat you here?\".  I explained what happened and she said she just wanted to be sure since I didn't have a menu. \n\nWhen Amanda brought my salad to me I had to remind her (3rd time) that I was still waiting for my extra lemons.  Finally got them. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food 3 people were seated in the booth next to me.  They had to wait for a server and when one finally came over to them they had questions.  The customers wanted to know about a sauce (not sure which one), the waiter starts to tell them what was in a sandwich.  When the customer said he wanted to know what was in the sauce and not the sandwich the waiter gave him a look of disgust and said \"I'm telling you all I know\",  looked at them again and then said \"I'll be back to take your order\" and walked off.  Amanda went to them sometime later and said that she would be their server because he became busy.  One of the other diners stated that she thought they might have scared him off and that he was snarly with them.  Amanda looked at them and said \"you're not going to run me off, are you?\"  I didn't think the either server was very nice to those diners.\n\nBack to me, once my food arrived the fries were limp, very brown and lukewarm.  Flo's filet came out fine.  I ate my food and I think Amanda only checked back with me once.  Someone else (manager maybe, she didn't identify herself) came to clear the table and asked if I wanted a box for the fires that weren't good.  I told her no and that they weren't very good.  She apologized and asked if I'd like another side.  Hello - I'm through with my meal, offer me a desert or something but not another side.  Received the check shortly afterwards, paid and left.  BTW, the table with the dirty glasses and silverware that was next to me was dirty the whole time I was there.  There were two couples waiting to be seated even though there were empty tables.  I may give this Longhorn another try but more likely than not I'll go to Lil' Abners.",

  "text": "I must agree with the other reviews here.  If this company isn't a scam, it sure conducts business as if it were a scam.  \nI purchased travel insurance from this company when my son was studying in China.  He contracted a stomach virus and needed brief hospitalization. \nWe filed the claim and waited... and waited....\nI called them up after about 6 to 8 weeks to see what was going on.  I was told that the review was in process and should be done within a week.  So, I am waiting again\nAfter two weeks with no word I call back and then was told that my claim hadn't been looked at yet.  The customer service rep found it and says, \"Well, this documentation is in Chinese.  We'll have to get this translated before we can look at it.\"  And I remind him that he works for an International Travel Insurance company, which means that there's a good chance supporting documentation will be in another language.  (So, if I hadn't called my claim would still be sitting in a pending pile.  This is about 2 and a half months after I submitted it.)\nSo, the claim is sent to translation and processed and about 4 weeks later I get a letter in the mail denying my claim in total.  The reason given was that it was a \"Pre-existing Condition\".  This was a one-time stomach virus.\nI sent in an appeal to this decision and waited....\nFour weeks goes by with no response.  So I called today to see where it's at and am told that no one has even looked at it.  The CSR tells me that she's going to expedite the appeal and will get back to me in a week or so.  I'm not holding my breath.",

  "text": "Let me start this review by saying that I have been to Spain and I am quite familiar with traditional Spanish cuisine -- when I was in Spain I did nothing but eat regional dishes cooked by locals and traditional restaurants for two weeks. Never EVER, in a million-billion years, did I ever think that I could find Spanish cuisine that came anywhere close here in the States. Chez Garces certainly proved me wrong. \n\nGarces is Spanish, so these are true Spanish tapas -- very few Latin American twists to the traditional recipes. You'll find tapas and wine from all regions in Spain -- of which I sampled on my last visit to Amada. Tapas from Catalan, Segovia, Toledo, Madrid and wonderful wines from each region to compliment every bite. \n\nEvery detail of your meal is thought out -- right down to the sparkling water... Absolutely check this place out if you haven't -- it is a MUST-go when you're in Philly.",

The place is not impressive when you first walk in. The dining room is poorly lit and decor very outdated. We weren't planning on eating there anyway, so that didn't really bother me. We ordered the oxtail with rice & beans and collards from the soul food menu and the fried fish and dry rice from the African menu and everything was great. The food is seasoned well and portions hearty. One of the best parts was the 2 spicy condiments that came with the rice and fish. They were really spicy and soooo good. I ended up putting it on everything. I will definitely be returning. The food is good, it's priced well and the people are very friendly. A great addition to Northeast eateries.",

First, the prices are crazy expensive. $11 for a 2 piece meal?!? Plus, they won't let you buy additional pieces of chicken a la carte. With that said, the food came out very hot. I personally thought my chicken could have been fried longer AND it was too greasy. The biscuits are amazing though. I doubt I'll ever return because the chicken is soooo much better at Gus's Fried Chicken.",

Went with my work team so started off with a few apps - whipped feta, hummus and bacon wrapped dates. The table loved the whipped feta the best I would say. The hummus had great texture but tasted a little too lemony to be my favorite. The chickpeas however gave it a nice crunch. I also appreciate cucumbers along with the pita. For my personal meal I had the turkey sandwich. I had hoped for a little spice with the banana pepper vinaigrette, but alas the aioli overpowered the boring sandwich. The people who got the lamb sandwich loved it so that may be the way to go. The bahn bee had very hard bread and was greasy. The worst though were the sides. The fries were so hard that they were more like the potato stick snacks I recall as a kid. The vegetable salad side was too sweet with a weird sauce that no one enjoyed. All and all I doubt I would give it another try even though service was great and the atmosphere is cute. The food needs to step up the game!",

The grocery part of the store is much less populated, and very expensive. But quite clean and organized! The one gripe I have about this place is the check out line. The place is always packed with people trying to buy lunch yet they seem to only have two check out lanes open. There's also no conveyor belt on which to set your groceries which congests the store even further. Lines form and people get agitated.

One of my coworkers recognized my mental state at the time and referred me to City Hydration. To be honest, I was both skeptical and nervous about IV therapy but hey I was hungover and willing to try it out. \n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside City Hydration, all my anxiety and skepticism was put to ease when Christie introduced herself, told me to recline in a comfortable chair, gave me a water and offered a blanket. She knew I was on a tight schedule and with the utmost efficiency she started the hydration process. There was no pain, there was no feeling of coldness, it was a tranquil experience that took no more than 30 minutes. After the process was complete, I stood up and almost immediately recognized that my nauseousness and dizziness was subdued. Christie did state that it could take an hour or two to realize the full results. I'd have to agree with her statement, within a couple hours I was my normal functional self again. I think for anyone who is skeptical, City Hydration is the perfect place to try IV therapy. I would highly recommend it and will go back to try the other IV options. Thanks again Christie you're the best!",

I tried a hazelnut truffle and it was truly heavenly.\n\nThey have gelato as well, but I was too distracted by the macarons and chocolates to give that case a look. \n\nThe guy who waited on us was also very nice...and French!

My 13 year old and I decided to head up the mountain on a rare rainy/cloudy day in September and were greeted with a 57 degree temperature.  Iron Door had the fire place cracklin' and our server, Nelson, was quite humorous and engaging.  The decor reflects the German heritage of the restaurant, and they offer a few German beers as well.  My son had the sliders with grilled onions and I chose to have one of their specials, a green chile chicken & rice soup.  No complaints from either of us, the service was great, the food was great, and the atmosphere was perfect for a rainy day.",

  "text": "I decided to give this place a try since it was the closest brunch place near me, and I didn't feel like waiting for first watch. It's a very cozy little place, it almost feels like your in someone's home. There's French music playing in the background and a nice little old lady was my server. She constantly checked up on me and asked me if I needed anything. The service was great, my food came out very quickly and the portions are pretty good too. The menu has your basics for breakfast and a few items that definitely catch your eye, like the French omelette. They also serve lunch entrees but it's more than just sandwiches, which is awesome. The chicken cordon bleu was very tempting. \n\nMy friend got the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was very bland. Instead I got the basic good morning breakfast with a side of grit. The eggs were seasoned well, and the grits was average. The pancakes were good. It was a little dense but the flavor was spot on. I Would definitely come here again to try out some of the other items. \n\nUpdate: went there again and got chicken cordon bleu and special omlette with goat cheese and veggies. It was phenomenal! Very flavorful. My only downside is the waiter. The older woman is such a pleasure to talk to but the younger waiter is not very pleasant and we had to wait till our meal was over to get a refill on water. She never came by us once.",

If I am going to one of these, I sometimes will park on the street further away, just to be free of the hassle.  \n\nThe larger Wawas that sell gas are also super busy.  One has to be extra careful and aware when moving about here.  I usually head to the back parking lot at this location if I am not buying gas.

  "text": "After running into stumbling blocks with other lenders -- including a nationally-acclaimed lender marketed specifically toward veterans -- my most excellent real estate agent (see his review elsewhere) recommended Jason Griesser and his team at Prospect Mortgage. My situation was somewhat unique and more difficult than usual, but not only did they work with me to qualify for the mortgage I needed (where the other lenders fell short), they were also extremely helpful every step of the way through closing. They made the entire process seem nearly effortless, including all of the extra steps required of a VA loan. In addition, I ended up with a slightly lower interest rate than I was originally expecting, as well as some unexpected cash back at closing. They were supportive and helpful during every step of the process, always answering any questions I had, and were never condescending or obstructive in any way. Settlement was never in jeopardy of being pushed back because of mortgage delays, and I closed in far less time than I had expected at the outset. Based on this extremely positive experience, I would gladly recommend Jason and his team to anyone looking to purchase a home or refinance.",

With L/T on a rugged multigrain bread, it's hands down the best egg salad I've ever had. They have a nice style with every food item, nothing is taken for granted, just as they didn't do a routine egg salad. Yes, comes with the horse radishy potato salad, yum. Excellent coffee, semi-friendly baristas - what more could you want? As mentioned, I particularly like their potato salad, check it out, it comes with sandwiches but I believe you can also order it as a separate side order. Outdoor seating is a plus. Wifi and warm, quiet atmosphere (despite the many young kids that are brought in) make it not a bad place to get a little work done as well.",

I am a performer, not really a visual artist, but I love coming in not sure about what I want to do and just figuring it out along the way, buffing and blending as I go...Working on wood is particularly therapeutic to me- I love distressing the wood and then lovingly sanding, staining, and dolling it up it afterwards.\n\nAfter a friendly welcome from Reno's favorite Michael,\n we got to meet the lovely Ashly, owner of Board & Brush, and her charming team of helpers, all creative and fun-loving, who have a great time helping folks out with their projects. I'm fairly autonomous when working on creative projects, but Board & Brush really has a great balance of when to step in and help someone find their way, and when to just let folks get their art on. They're also full of helpful painting tips and techniques to help you create what you're going for.\n\nWhat was also cool about this event was that I didn't even know anyone there, but we were all singing and jamming along together as we worked on our signs. All the finished signs I saw turned out really cute, and everyone seemed to be happy with their final product. Thank you Yelp Reno and Board & Brush for a fantabulous evening!

Everyone else needs to be trained/taught how to deal with the public. The health and beauty department is always about 90 degrees fahrenheit and I doubt that helps keep the products from spoiling/melting.\n\nThe last time I ate there, I was eating, when I suddenly heard the sound of nails being clipped. I looked over, and yep, the lady working at the cafe was standing right by the food trays, clipping her nails. When I told the owner bout it, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away to go back to stocking shelves. \n\nThe cafe serves up flavorless slop and I cannot believe I gave it the benefit of the doubt on three occasions. I could not even eat most of it. (you are better off eating at Soy Cafe) The prepared food in the refrigerated section is okay, a hit or miss. I keep asking them where they moved their 'Awesome foods' brand items and they keep pointing at other foods that are clearly not the same brand. I tried the other brands and they are not as good as the Awesome Foods brand. I guess they no longer carry them. \n\nThe juice bar attendants act as though I am torturing them when I place an order. No worries, there are LOTS of other juice bars in Philly, yes, even in my neighborhood (fish town)\n\nOverall, their prices on most items are too high and I suspect that their employees are paid a low wage. I often see products on the shelves that are about to expire the next day and there is no discount on them. All of this is a recipe for going out of business.\nI still go there to buy certain items, but do most of my shopping elsewhere.\n\nPenn Herb Company is MUCH better, so is Whole Foods and several others.",

  "text": "Wow!  The quality of food has gone down and the service has bottomed out! What's happened? I went in with two gentlemen with special needs.  I'd hate to think that this was the cause for the poor service..  The server dropped off the food and only came back if we flagged her down.  Miraculously once the forks hit the plates, to indicate we were done our meal, she ran up with the checks. We asked for boxes for the remaining food.. she ran off before we could ask for refills for our drinks.  Came back with ONE box and no bag.  We flag her down for the drinks. \"Do you want those to go?\"  First  time she actually asked us something since the food hit the table...  no,'how is your food?' No,\"would you like anything else?' No, \"Would you like a dessert?\"  We ordered dessert....after we flagged her down again.  Same \"Do you want the to go?\"  My friend finally asked, \"Do we have to leave?\"  I mean damn!\n\nOkay so then the server did not create a new check as we asked and just added it to one of the gentleman's checks.. we asked her to fix it.  She didn't. We go to pay and the gentleman was over charged.  The General Manger was called to try to fix the error and had a disgusted tone to his voice... and he turned out to not ask questions either... hmmm..  Crappy service and the quality of the food no longer supports the prices...  I'm truly disappointed since I used to enjoy this place.",

Now onto the rib eyes that had plenty of flavor and nice color.  If dining together, I suggest each person getting a different side as they don't do family style.  I asked for a wine recommendation to pair with the rib eye, expecting it would be the most expensive selection.. haha, the server suggested the zin.  It was fabulous.  We are generally 50/50 on having desert but based on the recommendation of the bread pudding we indulged.  Well worth the extra calories! The service was excellent and friendly.",

  "text": "I'm literally going on every review page I can to ensure no one else goes through the awful headache I did with this bus service. I showed up to the bus station about 45 minutes early for my 3:30am bus so I wouldn't miss it if they tried to leave early. They show up 45 minutes late to the terminal. I tried asking around the terminal to see if anyone knew the status of this bus, but there was not one rep for megabus present at all. I tried giving customer service a call but nothing the entire 45 minutes until the bus came. Freaking out because I have a set engagement to get to, I tried buying a ticket with greyhound instead around 4:10, WHO IS MUCH MORE RELIABLE HERE BTW, but ended up getting a refund for that because that's when the megabus showed up 5 minutes later. Finally getting on the bus and the bus driver was just rude and very short on words when I was asking him questions about my baggage and boarding. Now getting into the bus, it smells like this thing hasn't been cleaned in the past year. Please save yourself the headache and just fly, drive, or take the Amtrak.",

Nice music playing in the background , he got me very comfortable cleand my feet and legs with a nice warm towel and proceeded to massage my feet and legs. By the time I walked out my feet felt better than they have in months, even better than when I got a cortisone shot in my heel to help with the pain. By the time I had tipped the gentleman it cost me $37 for 30 minutes which is less than my copay. I intend to go back twice a week for about a month month-and-a-half and I will report back how it went.

My husband and I, taking advantage of their happy hour, ordered their nachos. We've had them before and they are yummy. But tonight, instead of cubed moist chicken they gave us soggy, shredded, crock-pot like chicken. Also, the nachos are supposed to come with beans. I counted the beans.......there were 7 total beans (I sent it back asking for more beans and my plate came back with MAYBE 12 beans). Flavor was lacking. My son ordered the corn dog pops. He loves their cheddar-IPA sauce. Our server did not tell us that the restaurant no longer made this sauce (despite us requesting two sides of it), and instead brought two sides of spicy mustard sauce (he's a little kid! What was the thinking there??). I have one other complaint that I have felt for awhile, that being that the service is T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E. Don't go in there expecting to get your drinks in a timely manner. You are lucky if you get them before your meal. And even more lucky if a server comes up to you to take your order at all.",

My first trip was to get a Po Boy because i heard they had the Previous owner's recipe (Patrick) and were still getting the bread from Leidenheimer's in New Orleans.  It is indeed the same Po Boy(which is by far the best poboy in Nashville), but I have to admit was a little disappointed to get a half for what I'm used to paying for a whole.  At least offer a whole for $20, I'd pay that for it.  My second trip was for a Burger, because when I was there the first time, the burgers did look fantastic.  I ordered a Jumpback Jack and my wife got the Fun Guy.  Both were excellent.  The combination of flavors on the Jumpback are about the best I've had in a long while.  While I've had some burgers at other places that I thought the actual meat was better (dry aged or wagyu).  The actual combination of toppings and meat really made it special.",

One is seedy, sweet ,and tangy while the other is like a more robust dijon. So goood. And the pretzel was a winner, easily one of the best I've ever had. It was fluffy and chewy and had just a little sour tang. \n\nI got the Hungarian beef stew with buttered spaetzle for my main. Mmmm...The paprika laced stew was hearty and flavorful without being heavy. It just warms you from the inside out. We split the sauerkraut (a must-order), the Brussels sprouts (another must-order), and the fried potatoes (I could do without these). I tried my friends' brats and thought they were yummy. I don't think I will be able to eat another J-ville brat again. \n\nThe apple strudel was flaky and buttery, but I would love to have a scoop of homemade vanilla on there, even if that's not how the Germans do it.\n\nThe food was excellent, but the service left something to be desired. Our waitress was condescending when she talked about the beers with us, she was MIA for a while, and she spilled beer on my boyfriend while flirting with him.

I recommend this place always because of the honesty and convenient location. Parking is always hard and so is space but that's because they share a lot with another good car garage.",

We ordered takeout as we were crunched for time.\n\nThe food:\nTwo delicious chicken pita sandwiches filled to the brim with very flavorful chicken and salad with large tomatoes, pickles, and delicious sauce.\nIt was truly mouthwatering and the sandwiches are huge, we split one and were so full. Seriously do yourself a favor and order this. So so good even the pita tasted amazing.\n\nIn addition we ordered 2 orders of falafel- each order comes with 2 large falafel- so much flavor and I could not stopped dipping them in the homemade yogurt sauce.\n\nThis place is the real deal and the prices are extremely reasonable for how much food you receive.\nIn addition, the employees are very professional and friendly. I cannot wait to try other options on their menu :)",

So no workers for over 6 weeks now, no one answers the phones anymore. I should have known better The Owner was so aggressive and threaten not to finish the work unless I paid, so I gave in, still never thinking he would just leave with my money & never come back. Besides being angry I am so humiliated and depressed over this.\n\nI do not even have a railing to hold on to going up the stairs, Water is now coming in where they built in my Air Conditioner, My wood floors are saturated and starting to warp \n\n\nPlease DO NOT USE Father and Sons.or Penn Home Remodeling LLC",

They have an awesome deal at 3 rolls for $12, which includes either soup or salad. Guess how many choices of rolls you get to choose from? 43!!! Lots of choices to choose from, and I really digged the Pepper Tuna roll and the Alaskan roll. I had the crabmeat apple roll, but didn't care much for it.\n\nMore reasons to love this place: Service is fast and friendly, and they have LOW-sodium soy sauce. \n\nMy challenge is to try different rolls/dishes each time I go there, except the California roll. :)",

Price: they matched the sale price of a big box store nearby, even though the big box store didn't even have that model in stock. Both big box stores couldn't even get one for weeks; Mark's got theirs in within 2 days. In terms of customer service -- all I can say is wow and I'll never go anywhere else for an appliance. First, our stove died just before a houseful of people showed up for the holidays. Big store: \"sucks to be you.\" Mark's: \"We will move heaven and earth, reschedule some deliveries that aren't time critical, and make sure we get it to you.\" THEN...the original one I ordered didn't fit the space. Seriously? With a big box store I would be SOL; Mark's ordered another that, on paper, was the same size, but the cooktop was configured a little differently, and voila, it fit. They didn't charge for ordering, trying to fit one, taking it back, then redelivering another one. Can you imagine the nightmare that would have been with the big box store? I offered to pay for the extra delivery and they said, naw... Last: it's now 9 months later. Fan sounds a little loud to me, not sure it's an issue, but could they check it out? Sure.... no problem... they'll come by to assess. There is no way on earth someone from the big box would just \"run by\" when they can, and even if they did I'd wonder if they were sending someone knowledgeable. I'm just floored by their great customer service and product knowledge, and would highly encourage anyone in the area to try them before ordering elsewhere. Just completely superior.",

Seriously I can't imagine going to other places that I had found rather than this. It's only a couple minutes away from Westfield mall while I was there anyways. First off, my technician is a perfectionist. Didn't get her name because I forgot but I def won't forget her face and talent. I got a fill and repair and I feel like I got a whole new set (but not for the price of one ) my coffin shape is beautiful, absolutely structured perfectly and man are they built nicely. Not too much acrylic nor gel polish on top. She even used a nail form to fix one of my nails because it was curving so bad, like I said she's a perfectionist. She didn't have to do that but she went ahead and made them even more outstanding. Secondly, as soon as you walk in your greeted promptly. They sat me down within 5 mins and I had a 3pm appt and walked in at about 3pm lol. Their selection of gel colors and dipping powders was overwhelming - but in a good way!! They just had so many colors, glitters and everything. You walk in with one idea but end up seeing all the things they have and end up wanting something else!!! Overall such a good experience, prime technician and beyond excellent work and talent. Like my tech said \"there's no limit\" because literally, they have it all! If I could give it more than 5 stars I really wish I could!! 10/10 highly recommend. Pricing wise, it's up there but it's affordable. For the work, quality and dedication you're receiving it's worth all the coins!! I so wished I lived closer and near because this would no doubt be my new go to spot. \nLol and yes I used my pup as a background and prop",

The staff is super friendly and do a great job with any order!\n\nThe drinks are pretty good - my favorite being a vanilla dirty chai with almond milk. They also have a bottomless cup of coffee deal for $3 - perfect for an all hours study binge! The food is decent - nothing fancy, but it's fresh and they have gluten-free bread that they'll substitute for any bagel. I like the Rox out with your Lox Out (open face) sandwich and the Garden Griller, but I mostly just eat here when I'm pulling a long study session and don't want to go home in the middle. \n\nThe music they play is pretty chill and usually my style, but you can easily put on headphones if you're feeling something else. \n\nIt can get crowded sometimes and harder to find a big table, but something usually frees up eventually!\n\nI would recommend it for studying, grabbing a coffee with a friend, or even a first date (I've eavesdropped on a some hilarious blind dates here).",

They take orders and bring drinks to the tables that come after us. It seems like they have no sense of organization. Tonight I decided to talk to the manager and all she did was give me the excuse of them being too busy and having poor quality of workers.. Well, how about management, how about leaving poor excuses on the side and take care of the situation... If it happens once it's fine, but all the time with different employees... I don't know.. something isn't right.",

I see a bunch of new places to check out and I'm just so excited to try them.\n\nI finally took the plunge one lunch to try their lunch menu.\n\nThe interior is super swanky, super chic vibe but with the sun out, my friend and I couldn't resist sitting on the patio to take in the nice weather. I was a little disappointed to discover that a lot trucks like to rip down this road which kind of took away the experience but I always enjoy patios nonetheless.\n\nAlthough I didn't try any of their wines, I still enjoyed the always default water. Their water had lemons in it which was a nice change.\n\nI decided to try their sandwich: panino italiano. I don't have a palette for Italian food but I'm working on it. I think this was my first experience eating authentic Italian meats so the taste was a little overwhelming. I came away feeling \"this meat tastes game-y\".\nTo be honest, it was a struggle to get through the sandwich. Only until I got to the middle I tried to focus on mixing the flavors of the tomato-y spread with the meat and cheese and the flavors mixed better.\n\nWaitress was friendly and came by to check on us frequently.\nMy sandwich came with a very small salad with oil and balsalmic vinegar.\n\nSandwich came out to about $12. \n\nI'd really love to come back and try their pasta but until I can figure out what I'm supposed to expect for Italian meats, I probably won't order the sandwich again.",

If I want to make sure that my car's service needs are properly diagnosed and fixed, I go to Cliff.  Crown's prices tend to run a little higher than independent garages or repair chain shops, but I know that I do not have to wonder if I'm getting unnecessary repairs performed. Also, I never hear anybody grumbling and grousing about ripoffs while waiting in the customer lounge, which, by the way, is very comfortable and stocked with coffee and snacks. Simply put, I trust my cars to Cliff Stoufer and Crown Service.",

I actually feel physically ill and I think the health department should check this place out. My brothers food was dripping with orange grease, it was an omelet. I ordered the Toad in the Hole sandwich, which I used to love, and I had to take off the tomatoes and avocado. The tomatoes had white spots all over them and were yellow in the middle; they looked like they were maybe a day from being rotten, if not already. The avocado was covered in brown- grey spots. I honestly wanted to throw up after eating it. All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I don't know how it has managed to stay in business this long, and it does not deserve to stay in business. Next time you want to eat out, go somewhere else instead.",

When regular plain fries were delivered, she mentioned it, but did not demand a replacement. After the more than courteous server Jordan inquired several times, my wife said it was her mistake and no problem. Minutes later, the manager Jessica arrived with an order of cheese fries. How unexpected and customer service oriented. Great gesture Jessica. You just earned a customer that usually goes to the Fishhawk location which is about the same distance. I had the Mouth watering Victoria filet and broiled lobster tail with a side baked potato and Caesar salad. All were cooked to perfection and would highly recommend. Happy hour till 7pm  is nice and the IPA on tap was earthy without a bitter after taste. The strawberry shortcake was scrumptious. Jordan was very upbeat and arrived at the table during the right times.",

I havent tired everything on the menu but im sure i would love everything.  =) great place to go to and not tooo expensive. true gem in philadelphia.",

  "text": "Hilton advertises trail rides at this resort. The trail rides were run by Pot a Gold adventures. More like Pot o Crap. \nWe were charged $80 per person for a sunset trail ride. When we arrived as instructed at 4pm there  was only one woman there , she had her retainer out on the table, was eating pizza, and had a pack of cigarettes next to her food, and the staff for the ride wasn't even there yet. We waited almost 20 minutes.\nThe smell was overwhelming. The horses were filthy, to be honest. They were caked with dirt and feces and their manes were matted. \nOur ride started at 4:40 and ended at 5:15. The sun was directly overhead and it was no where close to sunset. So, basically were charged for an hour sunset ride that was about 35 minutes and not at sunset.the \"sunset\" ride was $20 more PER PERSON than the one hour trail ride. The manager I emailed said they can't have the horses out at sunset because they get spooked and also because they need to eat. Ummmm, fine, but then don't call it a sunset ride and charge more for it. They refused to refund the extra money they charged for the \"sunset\" ride, and were very rude about it. \nThe horses were not well behaved and my husbands horse just walked off the trail to go back to the stable , the guide said he wanted to eat. The \"trail\", by the way, is a patch of grass and cacti next to the highway. It was awful. Not at all what was advertised. Will be reporting to BBB for false advertising by Hilton and Pot a Gold adventures.",

She's new to the practice (went to school at Vandy then moved for work and is back in Nashville) so she had good availability. I called Friday for an appt and got in Wednesday. \n\nThe reason for not giving 5 stars is 2 fold. The front office staff is not professional, welcoming or informative. Didn't even stop their conversation to greet me when I checked in. I used to do their job for a living so was disappointed to find yet another medical office with cold, uncaring staff. The other reason was the wait time. No one came to say \"Sorry for the wait, she'll be with you soon.\" Not a word and I didn't see the dr until an hr after my appt time. That's one of my pet peeves. Everyone knows Drs run late, but what happened to decency. If you're running more than 15-30min late have the courtesy and let you patients know. Thankfully I wasn't on a babysitter time limit today like I was going to be. I would still recommend the office because the Dr makes up for the rest. She's awesome!",

The third time I left with crooked ends and green tinted highlights and lots of breakage. When I called to have it fixed, Grace, who by the way is really nice, said Katie wouldn't get on the phone with me but it was beigey blond when I left so I must have done something to it.  Yeah, because I want my hair to look like green hay so I messed with it.  And Guess what?  Helen Keller and Stevie wonder both stopped me when I left  the salon and asked me why my hair was green. Anyway, she said I can come in for a clarifying shampoo and conditioner.  Yeah, I can go to CVS and do that myself.  I informed the very pleasant Grace to tell Katie not only did she lose me as a client but my friend who was horrified for me as well. I just went somewhere else at my expense to repair the damage as best I could. I did receive a call from the owner, who also was extremely nice, but by that point I didn't feel comfortable going back, which is a shame because all the other stylists' customers left that day with gorgeous locks. So one star for each good experience. The quest continues!!",

That sucks, but tell us that when we sit down so we don't waste time deciding which lamb dish to order!  My mom hates spicy food and ordered a mild chicken dish.  I love spicy and ordered a medium chicken dish.  We had to switch.  Hers made my eyes water and mine was bland.  The food itself was completely bizarre... none of it had any sauce.

They are an outstanding example of great service.",

It's great for takeout, or hang out in the trendy restaurant! Make sure you stir it up more than you think you need to! And keep sipping that miso soup! It's such an amazing combination. And because there are so many options and combinations, the revisit value for this place is high. Vegan, vegetarian, and kosher people can eat here and have a great time with their friends without judgement!",

Once my table was ready, I was told to walk across the room to the stairway and walk up a flight of stairs to be greeted by another hostess that would show me to my table.  The table they offered me was in the corner away from the live entertainment that was playing on the main stage downstairs.  I denied their table and found a spot at the bar on the same level that was not crowded.  I ordered a drink and sat back to relax to the sound of the band playing cover songs.  I thought the red tractor hanging upside down added a neat touch to the atmosphere inside the bar.  The drink I ordered was smooth and easy.  I just wished the band would have mixed it up with their own songs along with singing cover songs.",

  "text": "At first I thought this was a sketchy idea. My boyfriend wanted to eat Chinese but the only problem is that we couldn't find the restaurant. It doesn't have a sign and the area is pretty scary. The restaurant is located underneath a Mexican store. Be on a lookout for the yellow building. Walking in my first thought was this is a hipster fusion Asian restaurant. Staff are very friendly and laid back. Upon ordering I read other reviews about the general Tso chicken so I got that. Also the ginger noodles, craw rangoons and Hawaiian fried rice. The craw rangoons are delicious but the only problem is there's not enough filling. They cut their rangoons in half making the cream cheese filling melt out but the spicy green salsa condiment on the plates makes the dish taste amazing. Next the ginger noodles. The serve it with a gigantic spoon... This dish was my least favorite. It's was bland. I didn't not like it. Do not get it if you want to waste $12. General Tso chicken was pretty good. It's not your regular chopped up chicken. They serve you a breast, thigh, wing and drums. Best Tso chicken I ever had. It was a bit overcooked but tasted good still. I would recommend subbing the breast for thighs. Now my favorite dish is the Hawaiian fried curry rice. This dish is f***ing amazing. The pineapples were sweet, the bacon made the rice smokey, the curry was just awesome and I love how they had just a little bit of vegetables in the dish. Overall I would recommend this restaurant",

I hope this place can eventually become those places where you can come in with your laptop and work for half an hour with a cup of great coffee. P.S.

Rippy's is great for after work drinks or a quick dinner, but if your coming in from out of town and want to enjoy a nice meal I would suggest another place. The plastic cups and Paper plates were a huge turnoff epically for the price we paid\n\nThe Food was ok we had the nachos with pulled chicken, I believe they would have been better if they weren't served Luke warm. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs, and usually I am not a fan of dry bbq or bbq where you have to apply your own sauce but these were good. The meat was tender and smokey and fell right off the bone. The sweet tea could have been better.  My overall opinion is that the food was tasty and the atmosphere great but that does not equal a good restaurant. I would def try if your in downtown Nashville its a def must experience. I personally would just get an appetizer and drinks.",

When you walk in you see a wall of cheesecake and you pretty much know it is going to be a fun experience. We were fortunately seated near the HDTV at the back of the restaurant as we watched the Jets fail their faces off against the Steelers - that part sucked, but even that sucking moment was still fun since we were hanging out at the diner. We were in a big group and we also were sitting right next to another big group, the Duke University fencing team. This place draws big groups in because it has a legit reputation among everyone, locals and those from far away who had a great meal here once a long long time ago.\n\nThe big guy (4u) waiter right off the bat was friendly, gracious, and funny - top notch staff here for sure. The water was not exactly refilled at a regular pace but I guess it was pretty busy. It was really hard to choose a dinner since everything sounded so good. I finally settled on the open faced Monte Cristo, longing for 'ye olden days when that deliciousness of the Monte Cristo used to be available at Bennigan's before their shenanigans shuttered their doors across the country. Penrose does not make 'yo daddy's Monte Cristo and that is not an entirely bad thing.\n\nThis is french toast as the base, two pieces and very moist and eggy. Not fried like Bennigan's. Just french toast that is AWESOME. Then meat piled on top of the french toast. Then some cheese on top of that. And a big helping of fries. The fries were solid, the good diner kind, not the shoe string or crinkle cut or that other junk places try to pass off.\n\nI will be back for more Penrose.",

Ordered the quiche at 12:45 PM and was told that even though they had just run out, they would have another ready to serve in 1 hour tops. I waited until 2:15 PM until I walked up to the counter to politely inquire about the status of my quiche, as I was starving. Got a cold look and a \"Actually, it'll be 45 more minutes because we still have to cool it.\" Fine. Waited until 3. Still nothing. \nThe weirdest part was that they had ALREADY charged my card for the quiche. Before I could ask for a refund so I could purchase something else, she rudely snapped \"you can keep coming up to the counter if it makes you feel better, but I just can't cut the quiche right now.\" I was so shocked that I just said okay, honestly was a little frightened off. When it was finally made (2.5 hours later), it was essentially 4 bites of a veggie omelet with no crust. It would've been nice to hear a \"sorry about the extended wait\" instead of getting attitude. \nIt's totally fine if it takes you 2-3 hours to make that. Just don't lie to your customers in order to get them to buy things. And don't be insanely rude about it?\n\nAlso worth noting - the wifi here doesn't work if there are lots of people",

  "text": "We had my sons birthday party this weekend there. Needless to say, I will never go back and talked to the manager twice and all he could do was make excuses for the terrible service we got. Our \"party planner\" (I won't name her on here)was completely checked out, sat in the dark room ( not with the kids) playing on her phone. Thankfully my friends were there to serve the kids drinks and pizza. We paid for laser tag, ball blasters and black light mini golf. The laser tag was broken, one ball blaster wasn't working so one kid had to sit and watch and we never got to play mini golf. We had no clue what was going on or what activity was next as our party planner was no where to be found. We talked to the manager and he gave each kids ( there were 8) tokens to play arcade games... ha! What a joke. The games were broken and just took their tokens or didn't spit out the tickets. I called the manager today and he told me she is his best girl and something must be wrong. It's sad if that is his best girl. He told me to call him and he will let my kids play golf anytime on him. I said no thank you, we will not be returning. What really pissed me off was having to leave a $25 to a girl who played on her phone. I should have tipped my friends. I will never go back again.",

The mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth, and the pineapple casserole was an unusual hit with me that reminded me of pineapple upside down cake. It served as dessert with its sweet taste.\n\nWhile I had never heard of Barbara's, the atmosphere was interesting and homey. I felt like I was sitting down for a bite to eat at my grandmother's house. Service was friendly although not particularly fast, and photos of famous people who have visited line the wall behind the cash register. Actually, it sort of reminded me of the Loveless Cafe with better rolls.",

  "text": "I decided to try out guitar lessons because I've always envied the fun my brother and uncle have playing guitar. Also, with a little one on the way any day now, I think it's important for kids to grow up with, and around, music. Even though I had played other instruments fairly proficiently in the past, I knew that with something like the guitar, I could save myself a lot of frustration, bad habits, and time by getting lessons from a professional. And that's where Kale comes in! I've enjoyed and learned from each lesson from day one. I like the pacing and combination of music theory, technical lessons, and the opportunities to play along. My confidence and ability, even though still quite nascent, are far beyond what I could have accomplished on my own by watching YouTube videos or that kind of thing. When my husband hears me practice, which he admits to enjoy, he's impressed that he can recognize songs or notice improvement in such a short time. I'm very appreciative of Kale and the careful attention he has applied to my playing and lessons.",

Every baked good is made from scratch.  Their chicken salad is homemade and a staple in our home.  We are truly Bakery House converts!  We have a Bakery House cake whenever there is a birthday or a special event . The drive is not bothersome when you have such  great treats a the end of your trip! \n***A quick story.

  "text": "My favorite day of the year is Labor Day, when I attend the Reno Rib Cook-Off. This year we actually were there the day before Labor Day. It was a little bit more crowded at the event but the drive back to the Bay Area was much faster than doing it on the holiday.\n\nParking is generally very easy. It can take a minute, but there are several locations that are closeby, if you're patient. The streets are closed for the event and lots of stands to choose from, selling ribs and roasted corn, or other fried, delicious foods. \n\nSampler plates (3 ribs) are about $7 - though this year we saw one as high as $9 (and it wasn't very good). and one that gave us 4 ribs for $7 (from Memphis.... served dry, without sauce - they were the BEST ever!!!)\n\nTwo restaurants local to our home make it to the Cook-Off every year: Kinders and Back Forty Texas Barbecue. Both are really good but obviously I am not going to stand in line to try them at the cook off when I can get them at home.\n\nLots of vendors sell jewelry, clothes, popcorn, etc behind the street. There are also rides for kids. \n\nThe BEST thing is that there are lots of porta-potties, and they are super clean! They even smelled good... at the end of the day! In the HOT HOT HOT sun. It was nice.\n\nSo next year: save up your money, hit up the fest, and try like 5 different rib places and then some corn... get some sodas or stop at one of the bars on the street, ...maybe do a little gambling -- and you'll definitely have a new favorite day of the year! \n\n[Make sure to get a hotel room in advance because this weekend is always booked in Reno! Completely! From Motel 6 to Grand Sierra Resort to the Nugget - everything!!]",

When I stopped by to pick up the food, the place was packed. Every seat and table was occupied and they had to-go orders lined up on the counter! \n\nWe ordered two bowls of Pho with flank steak raw beef and it was delicious. The beef broth was very favorable and the meat was tender. They provided a very generous amount of toppings: bean sprouts, basil, lime, duck sauce, jalepanos. Each order of Pho was enough for two meals.\n\nWe've ordered Pho from here multiple times since and it's consistent and good. They normally have to go orders ready within 10 minutes. This is definitely a go-to place for us for Pho.",

It's not massive, so it doesn't have a HUGE selection of products, but what it does have is a very thoughtfully curated stock. The products they keep are hard to find in a lot of other places (lots of neat brush pen options, and Faber Castell water color pencils which I haven't found anywhere else!). The prices are really good (not 'boutique' - if that makes sense) and very reasonable to be honest. The service is great - the owner is friendly and so knowledgeable - he has a toolbox of supplies that you can test! How awesome is that?? Love this place - so glad I can support small businesses like this whilst also indulging in my love of all things stationery!",

Me and my husband needed the supplies we were do for the month and they are trying to send us all the supplies for a three month period. Our insurance only covers certain products per month, per 3 months, per 6 months. They kept transferring me from sales to billing then billing to sales and back and forth having to explain my story each time. I was simply due an amera view cushion and disposable filters which cost me $12.16 with insurance last month they were trying to get me pay $212+. Come to find out they had not even run it through my insurance yet. This was all over 3 different calls. So very upset and frustrated. Going to find new supplier. Update: After looking at mine and my husband's EOB from Insurance Verus had over billed us both. It it took 2 months and numerous calls to get a refund. All started first of July They said check had been sent in August then in September oh check has been on managers desk to sign. Got my husband's refund of $107 still waiting on my portion. Don't do business with this company",

  "text": "I ordered a substancial tile order from SCS Tile and I did not receive what I was shown. When I picked out my tile I was shown a square roughly 18x18 travertine . Yesterday my contractor went to pick up the tile and it was a  Versailles pattern. This pattern has 5 pieces, one of which is square. I went to see what the mix up was. The owner told me that I must have \"forgotten\" what type of tile I ordered and that he showed me all 5 pieces.  I explained that he did not , he only showed me a square piece and that I even had him come give me an estimate to set it diagonal . I told him that if he had shown me all 5 pieces I would have never ordered that. He was adamant that I did not remember what I ordered. He said he would let me order new tile but I'd have to pay a 25% restocking fee. He said the contract says no refund. While I was there he raised his voice at me, so I raised mine back. It became a shouting match at at one point he yelled SHUT UP. I yelled the same back . There was no reasoning with him . Now the tile is going to cost more to install because it more complex and more pieces. I think he should pay for the additional cost of $3150.00 dollars. He was not forth coming with what I bought . I had my contractor pick up the tile and I left , there is no reasoning with him . I'm appalled that he would treat a customer that way and believe that as a customer I don't know what I ordered! I have filed a complaint with the BBB and will seek legal action if he does not pay for the additional cost of installing the tile . I think I am being more than reasonable . I will never shop here again and will make all know of this awful experience!",

  "text": "There are not adequate words to describe how amazing Dr. K is with animals. She is literally the St. Francis of Nashville. I was gifted an American Bulldog puppy shortly after my husband suddenly passed away in 2013. Dr. K came highly recommended by my friend Jen who has owned and recused about a million dogs. Dr. K was just about to move from Value Vet to open her own practice on White Bridge Rd, so I decided to wait the couple of weeks for Lazarus' initial visit. He had his first round (or maybe two) of shots, but was not fully vaccinated. Before her office opened, he got very, very sick. \n\nMy friend Jen and I were thinking the worst - parvovirus. Jen gives me Dr. K's cell phone and having never met this woman, she said get him up here - now! The office was not opened yet, final construction was still going on with builders and workmen and supplier deliveries in and out...are we clear, this was a vet's office that was not ready for business. It didn't matter. She took him in her arms, tested him, confirmed it was parvo, hunted through boxes and bags and an unorganized mess to find what she needed and began treatment. She had me bring him in every other day for the first week for shots and fluids and SHE called me daily to check on him. In about ten days he turned the corner and recovered. With parvo, you either get better or you die - no in between. Lazarus would not be here today without Dr. K.\n\nShe later led my dad's precious Shih tzu, Scooter, over the rainbow bridge at age 16 when he had a stroke and was beyond help. She is simply the sweetest, most caring, compassionate, effective, intelligent person you can trust to treat your furry family members. I wish she treated humans - she would be my PCP in a heartbeat.\n\nOh, as a bonus, her prices for services are very reasonable. She could charge double what she does and it would still be a bargain for the care provided. Places like Murphy Road Animal Hospital should  be shaking in their boots with Dr. K as competition.",

  "text": "If, like me, you've avoided shopping at Whole Foods because you worried you'd blow your entire month's grocery budget on just one week's worth of groceries, this review is for you! While Whole Foods is definitely one of the priciest places in town to grab ingredients, some strategic shopping can really help take your home cooked meals to the next level. \n\nIn particular, the produce section is well-worth checking out as not only are the fruits and veg incredibly fresh, but there are also some rare/weird ingredients that will likely be impossible to find anywhere else in Nashville; I mean, the various farmers markets around town are great, but I've never seen satsumas (i.e., the best clementines you will ever eat), celery root, or kumquats there! I've also been cutting way back on my meat consumption, but I do still make one or two dishes a week with animal protein in them and I really appreciate how transparent WF is about where each meat product is from and how it is raised. Yes, you'll definitely pay more than you would for the anonymous bulk chicken you could get at Kroger, but I'm willing to pay a little bit extra to assuage my conscience about the meat I'm eating (and let's be honest,  meat that's raised on farms is going to be healthier than factory-farmed meat). I'd say you can pretty easily skip WF's frozen seafood selections, however, since I once got halibut here and it wound up having tons of bones in it (an issue I've never had with the frozen fish from Publix or Kroger).\n\nAnother huge plus to me is that you can get eggs and milk that are sourced from LOCAL farmers, which again, is worth a few extra dollars as far as I'm concerned. But it's also worth noting that the WF brand of organic milks and eggs are actually a bit cheaper than comparable products at Kroger, so not everything is necessarily pricier here. I've also found that if you're looking for frozen dinners and the like, if you stick to what's on sale, you can definitely walk away spending less than what you would at other stores (though the regular prices will definitely cost more than elsewhere).\n\nI can't say that I'm at a financial point in my life where I can buy all of my groceries at WF with impunity, but picking up a few unusual fruits/veggies and some \"happy\" meat is not nearly as cost prohibitive as you might think. Plus, if you feel like picking up a quick meal once your shopping is done (or before so that you can build up your energy?), the hot bar is always filled with yummy options... but be careful, because my husband and I have easily spent $30 there sampling random things! WF definitely feels like a luxurious shopping experience, but if you care about the quality of the food you ingest, I think you'll agree that buying certain core ingredients here and supplementing your shopping at a cheaper grocery store just makes sense!",

  "text": "Right to it: The Yelp Indy International Supper Club rolled in 26 deep for a full dinner on a Wednesday night at 7. Over in the other corner was a party of 10. I was blown away by Peter & Co.'s service.\n\nThis was my first sit down, full meal at Saigon. Expectations: High. Reality: Really High. \n\nThis place is exactly why I travel. Nearly every city in America probably has something similar -- a strip mall tucked away in a unsuspecting area -- that is thriving with authenticity. Especially here, the Banh Mi & Pho! \n\nNow... that's not all they have... their menu is, well, how do I say it, um... HUGE!\n\nFrom lemongrass beef wraps to catfish in a clay pot. I went with the finest soup & sandwich of my life: bbq pork banh mi & Pho Special of flank steak, beef brisket, beef meatballs and tripe in classic Pho fashion. \n\nMy first visit I thought I was eating bbq beef banh mi, I was incorrect -- it's some stellar bbq pork that is spot on.\n\nThe bean sprout & fresh basil side plate with the pho was a supreme touch. \n\nThe service was pretty remarkable considering he's serving a party of 26 in a restaurant that seats about 40 at most. Um, the Yelp Supper Club came through -- big time here. At the other end of the table, I salivated, and salivated, for the Vietnamese Coffee that Jessica  & Rodney were having. My lord, I have to return midday before my coffee cut off time of 3pm. \n\nAnd then, something historic happened. There it was, the banh mi bbq pork (re: photo)... it sat there with it's open profile of pork, cilantro, cucumber, carrots & jalapeno on a french roll; she just couldn't resist. She, whom is anti-pork as my Inner Rabbi, my LP, took her first banh mi bite, and I have a Sakijewa golden dollar on it that she'll return for more!\n\nAs will I!\n\nNote: Amazingly classy touch of the sides of beer six packs cut out and taped above each booth in a row to display what beers are offered (which includes 3 Viet beers!)",

You get to pick what toppings (salads) go in your pita and say how much and he puts them in. I re-heated my falafel pita later and it was still JUST as amazing, if not moreso! Definitely better than Maoz, where you make your own. The falafel tastes better and doesn't upset my stomach. Also, I can't put a pita together like the professionals here, with their fancy paring knives cutting the pita all fancy and neat and not making it overflow or rip. I just can't do that. So I get something yummy and stay neat too. Neat-o. (*sigh* how I love gratuitous-ness-ness).\n\nAnyway, It was very very yummy and authentic.

Anyhow. \n\nMy husband and I arrived there just before noon on a Saturday. We were the only ones in the restaurant. There was only one person working at the time. A few min (maybe 10) later, another 2 people came in. The hostess/waitress/cook came over to take our order...but only to have us write down our own order on an envelope because she said something about having to be in the kitchen (very hard to understand her). She then went to the other table to have THEM write their order as well so she could hurry back to the kitchen. While we were waiting for our sampler appetizer another table came in and thankfully 2 more people came in to work. I always read reviews and noticed they were very slow and short-staffed. Once they arrived things started to get a little better. We got our appetizer but was told that it was missing an item and to just eat what they brought out and that they would bring out the other item later. Well we got our main course and half way through, I realized we never got the rest of our appetizer. I waved someone down to let them know and she eventually brought it out. After eating, we sat for about 10-15 min or so, waiting for our check. Like other reviews, we had to flag someone down for that as well, despite them walking by and us not eating. The food was excellent though, thankfully, as this was their saving grace. We ordered the appetizer sampler for 2, the Queen's Eight, and Ethiopia's main dish (I don't recall the name). It was all VERY good and I would def go back, now I know what to expect. Give it a chance, as long as you have ample time to do so!!",

  "text": "Walked in for dinner with my girlfriend on a whim. I had read up on Maynard's here on Yelp, so I knew to avoid sitting on the patio. Apparently this wasn't even an issue as all the tables had been booked and the only available space was at the bar. This suited me just fine since a not-so-secret restaurant tip is that sitting at the bar almost always guarantees good service.\n\nTrue to that truism, the bartender treated us great. Mixed up an Old Fashioned for me and seemed proud to do it right. I wish I had known about their reputation for good cocktails as I'd love to try more of them. I guess I'll have to go back soon.\n\nMy girlfriend got the bouillabaisse which was pretty tasty and she seemed to really enjoy it (I've had better but I'm not holding that against them or anything).\n\nI got the cassoulet which was easily one of the richest things I have ever eaten. It's one of those dishes that is so good you know you'll be burping it up all night with a pang of regret but you cannot stop eating it because it's just so unbelievably rich and delicious. The only thing I didn't like about it was the house-made sausage that came with it. It was like a light liver sausage that I'm sure would have pleased a palate more accustomed to it, but I could have done without it.\n\nAll told, the food rated between very good and excellent, the drinks were well done, we were treated well by the bartender, and I really enjoyed the ambiance and architecture. I will certainly return.",

I had been looking forward to checking this place out since it had opened a few months ago.  I like BBQ and sandwiches (although I'm no BBQ aficionado) and I went in with an open mind.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, my friend and I were greeted by the manager and were immediately seated.  We then met our server who was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful.\n\nFor an app we ordered the fried pickles which came with ranch dressing and another dipping sauce.  They were really good and got me excited for the meal.\n\nI ordered the hamburger, only because I wasn't in the mood for a huge meal and my friend ordered the brisket.  I got an order of mac and cheese as my side.  When my burger came, it was dressed pretty basically with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  The burgers aren't cooked to order, and the one I had was pretty dry and over cooked.  It wasn't juicy at all and I didn't even finish it.  The mac and cheese was good, but it wasn't overly spectacular.  My friend ordered potato salad with the brisket, which I tried, and could tell that it was likely store bought (which isn't horrible, but I've had better).\n\nAll in all, the place was a solid three stars.  The staff was amazing, the atmosphere is nice and the food came quickly.  I was sad to see that there weren't more people in here.  I really am rooting for this place, especially because I think the Westbank needs an \"authentic\" BBQ place.",

This place earned that seminal grant the hard way - by scraping barely-sufficient pennies together in crumbling warehouses for a decade - and earning the loyalty of area artists and art lovers for the duration.  Warhol allowed it to move into a clean, well lighted space finally...\n\n... with a gallery space large enough to do some good shows, & the other spaces - former admin offices of Tucson's Fire Dept. - the impromptu meditations on this space's history and future - just what I'd expect from a MoCA.\n\nI reconnected in 1 of those with a Walter Benjamin essay I hadn't read in decades, particularly apt for our contemporary situation [something about art and reproduction, you either know it or not], in another met the living room furniture for our near-future downsized living quarters, and in the gift shop discovered a local writer, Aaron Michael Morales.\n\nFew 'BIG CITY' museums have ever given me more.",

We got chocolate hazelnut (it's way better than the Nutella) and black cherry. Both were incredible, I plan on coming back here on a regular basis!",

Certainly better than one would get as bar food at any non-mexican joint. The real problem was with the pieces of chicken meat in them. Several sinewy  tendon pieces and an over all texture like one gets from sub-par chinese food. \n\nThe Ugly: THEY ARE SCREWING THEIR CUSTOMERS. I found a tequila I like on their menu advertised for $8.50. No other explanation, so you can have a shot, or a marg, or whatever, right? Wrong! The check comes and drinking it on the rocks is a $3.00 up charge!!!!!  No lime juice, no cointreau, no shaking. Just put ice in a glass, pour liquor over ice...$3.00! I am tired of these faux trendy spots dropping an up charge for pouring what should be the same amount of liquor over ice, so I complained and they took off the charge, but only after I got a condescending \"education\" on how they screw people. \n\nThe waitress explained to me (in a \"you dumb-ass\" manner)  that drinks and shots are made with 1oz pours and that on the rocks was 1.5oz. and so they cost more. THIS IS BULLSHIT! Shots and drinks are (should be) made with 1.5oz of liquor and then add the rest of your ingredients. The exceptions are \"pony shots\" which are 1oz pours, but one finds this with fine brandies and cognacs. To add insult to injury, our drinks were not even 1.5oz!  \n\nI spent ten years behind a bar in Austin, Texas. Five of those years as the head bartender in an Interior Mexican restaurant that is considered one of the best in the world. Two more as the bar manager of a more trendy and fast paced Tex-Mex joint. I know how to pour a proper drink. \n\nDon't assume your patrons are idiots, it's the fastest way to loose them.",

Needless to say I had a great time here and thankfully I did take a picture of my rolls to help piece together the blurry evening. The servers were friendly and very attentive in the beginning of our meal, towards the end the service slowed down and we found ourselves sitting around waiting for our checks to come back. \n\nJackson's doubles as a night club at night. I have never had a bad time here and I tend to find an older crowd here, which is refreshing in comparison to the 18 and up crowd at some other bars in the area. \n\nJackson's also offers a pretty good brunch on the weekends. It's all you can eat stations for about $22-$35 a person (I can't remember exactly) and does not include drinks.  They have everything from sushi to carving stations to a chocolate fountain. My favorite part of dinning here during the day is sitting outside since the restaurant is located right on the water. This is a great place for a more upscale brunch. I think Jackson's could be a #1 brunch spot if they offered an 'all you can drink special' with brunch since this seems to be a very popular option right now.",

We get there and already we had issues with seating, the tables where wobbling all over, finally moved to the 3rd table and was fine but we had to move all our plates, drinks etc ourselves (red flag)... I don't know if it was our skin color or what, but we felt something...Waitress greets us and was like rushing us to order. We ordered Pate, coquille saint jacques, garlic custard, stuff shrimp, onion soup, and the mussel which were cold you can tell it was sitting for a little while... After we ate a table next to us order the same mussell dish, to our suprise it came with a small fork and a big bowl to toss the shell....and we got crap!!! The best french food we've had in a long time since living in Tahiti and we are american/french!!! Unfortunately some of the staff  perticularly Vanessa just ruined it for this great french restaurant, you folks needs to bring in professionals to wait. Our bus boy and food runner  should of been our waiter, not once did she even bother to ask how we were doing....",

It's hit and miss, kind of like the customer service at this place.  Speaking of that, as other reviewers have said, they don't take credit cards. The last holdout business in town, presumably because they can't afford it (although they'll pass the cost on to you in the form of a \"convenient\" ATM that will charge you a hefty fee). They can, however, afford to spend money on gaudy light up palm trees in their parking lot that cheapen up the neighborhood.  \n\nTip:  Do not order a Chicago style pizza to go. The cardboard box is woefully inadequate to handle the amount of sauce they drown the pizza in and you will end up with sauce all over you and/or your car. Also, apparently it's too much trouble to slice the pizza for you too, as ours was not sliced after we got the sopping wet box home. There was so much sauce it drowned out the other flavors of the pizza.  We threw most of the pizza away.",

  "text": "Two stars is sad... I hate giving negative reviews. But it's deserved. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. Perhaps it was built too hastily, perhaps it is just poorly maintained. Either way, on my mom and her friend's stay, everything that could have gone wrong did. I booked this based on shining reviews, location, and style. I thought it was a cool, swanky place that would be a cool experience for my mom, and it turned out to be a nightmare. Thank god she and her friend have a good sense of humor.\n\nSo here's what happened.\n\nThe first night in the room my mom and her friend go to pull down the curtain over the sliver of a window at the far left of the room -- which, let's stop right there -- this thing let's in as much light as a prison cell I'd imagine, don't expect the room in the picture with those big windows and nice views -- so this window was sad to begin with, but when they pull on the curtain the whole thing collapses on them. They kindly call the front desk, very sweet girl who works down there, and she sends the maintenance guy up, who is also very nice, but he informs them that the window curtain was broken to begin with and not properly installed so no wonder it came down on them. After some apologies they pack up their stuff at 10pm and are moved to the same room but 3 floors up.\n\nIn this new room they unpack and settle in, the curtain comes down without any hassle, so that's great. My mom decides to take a hot shower, but surprise, the water never gets hot. They call the front desk again and the same maintenance guy is set up again. They are promised hot water by the morning.\n\nSo then as they are laying in bed, relaxing and reading, they hear a loud BOOM. They don't even want to go around the corner to see what it is, but they do, and the clothing rack -- which by the way only provides you with 8 hangers (so 4 hangers each for a room that is suppose to be double occupancy) -- has broken and fallen down. I can't tell you that I've ever experience a solid wooden bar to fall to the ground with only 8 hangers worth of clothing. \n\nThey don't even bother call downstairs this time.\n\nSadly the woes would not end there -- the walls were so thin they could hear not only the sound of their neighbor pulling down Their curtain, but partying neighbors that were up all hours of the night to the point where they gave up on sleep at around 630am. And that \"chic retro\" clock ticked so loud that my mom ended up unplugging it and putting it in the bathroom. \n\nOn top of that, my mom's friend goes to shower with that hot water promised to them in the morning, but it's only mildly lukewarm again. To top it off, the shower drain was clogged and backed up so far she was worried it was going to spill over the lip of the tile. She took a picture and let it sit for and hour -- when she came back the bottom of the shower was STILL clogged up. So the maintenance guy was called up again to unclog the drain in the morning, and from that she witnessed the gallons of hair clogging it up.\n\nOn top of this, the pool is just ridiculously small and only has 4 lounge chairs. Yep. FOUR. For the ENTIRE hotel. And there's just one complimentary small bottle of Dasani in the room - I mean ok, the complimentary part is nice but for a room with 2 Queen beds that could hold up to 4 people you better hope you don't get thirsty in the middle of the night and make sure you ration your water out sparingly.\n\nThey were thankfully compensated free breakfast, free drinks, and parking, but this is nowhere near what they should have been compensated. I would say at least 1 night returned to them out of the 2 nights they stayed there. On top of that, my mom's friend left 3 voicemails on the general manager's phone that were NEVER returned. This is just bad business. There should have been a call even just to apologize for the series of unfortunate events that happened. \n\nWith it's terrible quality of rooms for the high price you pay, this place just fell flat on living up to it's expectations and promises. The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for the incredibly kind and awesome people they have working at valet, the front desk, and the maintenance guy. Either way, I'm booking my mom somewhere else next time. Good luck if you take a chance on it.",

  "text": "Victoria Park is the unsung gem of the River Valley! It is close to downtown but without the crowds of Hawrelak and Louise McKinney. During the winter they have a very large skating rink that is used by the Speed Skating community for practice as well as time trials. It is also open to the public most days and there is a sign posted with the schedule in the main lot. During the summer it has a ball diamond to use as well as a playground that is tucked away from the sun (good for families that have little ones). It is great for most outdoor activities such as baseball, volley ball, soccer, and kite flying and has easy access to the trails for roller skaters and bike riders. \n\nThe back of the park runs along the Victoria Golf Course and the east side meets up with the Royal Glenora Club. There have been many afternoons that I have searched for an open picnic spot in the valley but have had no luck in the other parks. Every time I find my self heading to Victoria and scolding my self for not just heading there in the first place. One perk is that it has year round washrooms which is great if you are into the snow sports that the valley can offer. My only complaint is that many people use it as a turn around for River Valley Road so at times it can be a touch noisy. \n\nAt the far back of the main field there is a great group picnic spot that has a very large fire pit made out of a concrete ring. It is big enough to have a bon fire and is encircled in low benches so it is ideal for a large group. During the summer there is also a small trailer parked in the main lot that sells BC fruit which is the perfect treat on a hot summer day.\n\nI highly recommend stopping by to take a look at one less traveled parks that the River Valley has to offer.",

We are so obsessed with spirits, voodoo, vampires, serial killers, and I have been doing tons of research in witchcraft lately. Peak (please forgive me if I misspelled this) was absolutely fantastic! She was personable and so very knowledgeable. No questions seemed to throw her off and you could tell she really cared about what she was teaching. I was very surprised when she mentioned she has only been leading these tours for about 3 weeks so far. Thank you for an incredible experience!",

Miranda picked dogfish and suggested hodge podge hash. We did a big kid breakfast also. Big kid breakfast was just as it was described basic egg,bacon,and toast. My hash was off the norm with sausage,and lots of peppers and onion with cilantro and sauce. The guy who brought it out noticed i ordered potatoes with hash so offered fruit and i apreciated the suggestion. He never brought the fruit. Hash was good and large portion.43.05 was total left 50.00 . Didnt get fruit so didnt do you 20 percent tip plus 50.00 was easy to not request change. Its a 4 out of 5. 0",

On a different hospital visit, in October, they denied my claim because they wanted it to be resubmitted, even if the hospital submitted a claim on my behalf and there is no reason to deny a claim when it comes to a small injury, for about $900. They say they need more time, they ask for more paperwork​, all for no reason. I have passed this to our family lawyer, I will not let them ​get away with this over my dead body.

I can get better froyo from a multitude of places across the bay.\n\nSomeone from the business reached out to me on IG and specially asked if I would bring my Mom friends and their kids in for some treats. I said sure, we'll come spend our money at your business.\n\nThe group I came in with was a total of 12 people, moms and kids. The two staff helping us were super friendly when it was just us inside the froyo Shoppe. Then for some strange, weird reason, one of the employees started discriminating against us when another customer walked in. It was super bizzare and very inappropriate considering we had spent about $50 as a collective on some below par froyo.\n\nI actually reached out to the person about how we were treated and she justified her and her staff's actions because \"they turned the tv on for the kids\".\n\nI'll absolutely skip this place in the future!",

  "text": "I've said it before and I'll say it again: One of the most pathetic feelings in life is running for a bus with your big dumb bag and seeing that bus pull away. So close, so close... Oh I've been there and I've vowed never to be that particular feeb again.\n\nI was reminding myself of this very promise to myself the other day when I saw Gigi and Big R's food truck parked outside of 30th Street Station. I was already on the verge of being late for that accursed megabus to NYC, but I still found myself tempted to stop for some of this truck's Caribbean stylins. \n\nNO. I had to put my foot down with me. You know why? Cause if runnin late for a bus with your big dumb bag is pitiful, nearly missing a bus, running with luggage and a styrofoam container heavy with fried flaky white fish, rice & beans, cabbage, and plenty of hot sauce shakings is even more risky business. But I WAS tempted, cause that was some good cookin there. I mean, I thought about it.\n\nWe had split that hefty platter when we encountered Gigi and Big R at the Mann Center in September. The deal was kinda pricey at about $15, but I will say that they did give you plenty. We shared it in the rain, under an umbrella on the lawn: Crispy fish fried in long strips, tender sauteed down cabbage, rice and beans, and hot sauce. \n\nSee, that would be a nice lunch for you on the bus, if you indeed made it, except that everyone would want to murder you dead for fillin the bus with the delectable smells, and for enjoying your life or whatever. Yeah, you can't be eating on the bus. I reminded myself of that fact too. That's another thing.  What everyone on the bus has in common with each other is that they inherently loathe everyone else on the bus. Why? I can't tell you, but damn don't it seem to be so. On my way back from NYC one time some cat brought on the bus with him some dirty water dogs from a cart. You could feel the hate for him grow every time he pulled another one outta the brown bag. Like, the nerve...who does he think he is?\n\nSo yeah, I wanted that fried fish platter, alright. I wanted it. I'll get it the next time that I'm not running late for the bus. Plan ahead, sister.",

Very classy.  They have a pretty good selection and will happily serve a mug of something cold while you enjoy a smoke.  The lounge is nice, even if it's a little cramped.  Leather seating all around, a large HD TV and superb ventilation mean that they've hit all the high-points on my list of expectations.\n\nIt's obviously in a high-rent suburb, but I felt that the prices were still pushing the upper limits.  Still, my cigars were perfectly preserved and the staff was incredibly friendly.  They also win major points from me for warmly embracing pipe smokers.  \n\nIf you are in the area and like atmosphere and quality more than low-prices, this is an excellent option.",

Upon arrival, a man with a wizard like cape will greet you and gather your bags to escort you to check in. The hotel allowed us to check in early without question so that was nice. The room itself is basic and nothing to speak of. THe hotel is undergoing renovations so it has a few places that look undesirable.\n\nThe bellhop staff is great and very helpful, Especially, Ebanks. However, the front desk staff is just average. \n\nNow, to what sparked me to write this interview.. There are no vending machines or microwaves in this building. I am 8 months pregnant and those thins are essential. How can I not be able to buy snacks when I need them? All of he walking you do here, a vending machine is necessary as it is annoying as ____ to have to walk to local stores to get bottled water. Also, there is no microwave available for guests to use. This is major as NOLA is a prime place to eat and staying here, you would not be able to reheat any of the delicious food you purchase. Right now I'm looking at lobster Mac and cheese and stuffed red fish that I cannot eat because there is no microwave. Honestly, this is a major turn off for me and for that reason, I would never stay here again. Obviously, I'm pissed, but for 1200 dollars for two people , I need a microwave. Rant over!",

My girlfriend had Willa Jean's on her list of places to eat, so we checked it out for brunch.  Construction was going on either next door or upstairs, so the sounds of drills and hammers we could have certainly done without --- even still, the atmosphere was nice, the staff was friendly and the service was quick.  Loved the décor, cute and contemporary.  I had the country fried steak with sausage gravy on a biscuit...melt in your mouth good!  The seasoning on the batter, just delicious...the gravy, flavorful, and the biscuit...oh man, wish I could've taken a basketful home with me.  My girlfriend had the chicken and biscuit with gravy I believe and she too enjoyed her meal.  All in all, we would definitely return next time we're in NOLA.  Definitely worth a try if you find yourself in the area as well! :)",

Casual atmosphere, decent prices. We got a booth, and the side I sat on there was a big pillar and made it annoying to get in and out. Our server forgot my soda order, it was 9:00 PM And maybe six people total there. Aside from that the snow crab legs we ordered were amazing. So good! The fries were nuked and dried out. The potatoes were questionable so we passed. For three lbs between two of us and two sodas came out to $60. Great place for laid back dinner and great crab legs.

I immediately loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, it was very calm and classy and the servers were incredibly responsive and professional. \n\nAlthough afterwards it was clear I was not a fan of Japanese food, I still had a wonderful time. It helped that I was with great company but in addition, the atmosphere and impeccable service. \n\nIf you're a fan of Japanese food, or would like to try it out, this is the place to do it. The prices are also quite reasonable and the amount of food provided is impressive.",

  "text": "Why didn't I know about the Rib Cook Off before???  This year was my first time going and you better believe I'm going every year from now on!  We stayed at the Nugget so our backyard was the Rib Fest.  We arrived Friday morning which was the best idea because we were able to walk the whole festival with ease.  There were some people but it wasn't as bad as Friday night and Saturday which are the busiest times.  We had ribs galore (my personal favorite was Bone Daddy's - marinated perfectly, bbq sauce had a little bit of heat to it and the meat was falling off the bone good!), beef ribs, corn, cornbread, cole slaw, beans, ice cream, deep fried zucchini, funnel cakes and beer!  It doesnt get better than this but I'm definitely detoxing all the meat consumption still.  We woke up Saturday morning went downstairs to buy more ribs and brought it into our hotel because the crowd was approaching.  Sunday we also went early to buy a full slab of ribs to take home.  It says they open at 11am but we went down at about 10:30 and were able to get our orders in.\n\nI'm coming back next year and I'm sticking to the same game plan.  Arrive early Friday until Sunday and staying at the Nugget.  Can't wait for you to come back Rib Fest! Yummmm!",

This is a little place run by a husband and wife - he cooks, she serves. They are very friendly, while my husband and I were checking out the menu, the owner came out with a little plate that he'd created a food face on for my son. It was very cute. \n\nThe service is prompt and excellent. We've only had breakfast there, so I can't comment on lunch options, but I can say that everything we've ordered is very good. I had the Hash Mountain once, and the breakfast bowl another time, my husband had biscuits and gravy, and Sausage Mountain. They have great toast too! If you're looking for a good, hearty meal for a low price, with great \"mom & pop\" style service, this is definitely the place to go!",

  "text": "We went to Katie's on a busy Friday night.  Fortunately, we had reservations because the wait when we arrived was over 1-1/2 hours.  I would say on the weekends reservations are a must and perhaps on weeknights as well.  This is a very popular place for modern, creative pizzas, pastas and other related cuisine.\n\nMs T and I ordered a Caprese Salad and a Meatball pizza to share.  Our friends the D's did about the same thing, with different salad and different pizza.  They also brought a bottle of good chianti to share.  Katie's will do corkage for $20.\n\nWe were both disappointed in the Caprese Salad.  I knew when they placed it on the table that the large, yellow heirloom tomato was way over-ripe.  I could see that it was mushy and it indeed tasted over-ripe in that it had lost its flavor and had no backbone (like an over mature wine that loses its fruit and acid).  This should not have been served.  With good tomatoes, this would have been a good salad.  Again, heirloom or not; local or not, they still have to taste good and have good texture.  I liked the fresh mozzarella but will say the basil was very skimpy on it.  The overall serving was generous, but considering the price, it needed to be.\n\nOur pizza was just OK, not remarkable.  The meatballs are not seasoned much, but the cheese and sauce were good, as was the crust.  The pizzas are probably 10\" to 12\" and it was easy for the two of us to eat it all, which is something we never do.  I asked for fresh chiles on my half of the pizza and there were not more than  1/2 teaspoon of finely minced chiles serranos that I could see and barely taste.  I paid $2 for that addition.  At least four times as much chile would have been good.\n\nYou have to appreciate fru-fru pizzas more than we do to appreciate Katie's.  It is one of those trendy places, popular for being popular, that I expected more from.  This is also an expensive place.  Our bill was $50 for a small pizza, a salad and  1/2 of the corkage.  Ms T thinks three stars over-rates this meal.",

  "text": "OK I don't understand why the star ratings so far are so bad if everyone is saying they really liked the food. Maybe the ratings are from competitors?\n\nSo here is the REAL blow-by-blow breakdown of this place.\n\nYES it is mobbed. That's because there is a HUGE HUGE HUGE pent-up demand for fast casual Mexican in Tampa, and people are flocking there. After all, let us review our options for fast Mexican food in Tampa Bay: \n\n1. Chipotle = Sodium-filled food, pre-cooked and later boiled in plastic bags. A digestive nightmare.\n\n2. Tijuana Flats/Moe's = Can't really tell the difference between these crapholes; \nboth are substandard Mex joints that would go out of business in California, Texas, etc.\n\n3. Taco Bus = Tasteless food served in cardboard tortillas in a dirty restaurant.YUM!\n\n\nBut back to Lime Fresh:\n\nDo not just show up. Place your order online before you head over there. When you get there, go to the back of the restaurant where the takeout cashier is. Pay for your food there, take it to a table, and eat. This took me 5 minutes. And watch everyone else wait in line for 30 minutes. I had the chicken soft tacos and my friend had the chicken cobb salad. Both were good. Both tasted fresher than any food at the above-mentioned places.\n \nLime Fresh is not the same as Moe's, Tijuana Flats or Chipotle. It is much much better. Is it the best Mexican food you have ever had? NO. Is it authentic Mexican, Cal-Mex, Tex-Mex, etc.? NO. Is it better than the fast food Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, California, etc.? NO. But is it better than Chipotle, Tijuana Flats, etc.?\nYES!!!!!!!\n\nThe ingredients here are much fresher than at Chipotle and Tijuana Flats, you can taste it. (Well, let's face it, the food from Chipotle comes already cooked in plastic bags, which they later boil.) The execution with some of the meats at Lime Fresh is not there yet, but I am hopeful they will get better with that.\n\nThis place is automatically better than the above mentioned places JUST for the extensive salsa bar, which is standard in Cali, Ariz, Texas, etc. but most no one else in Tampa has. And the pico de gallo is pretty decent, as are the other salsas. The menu is extensive, the dining space is nice and huge, the online order process was seamless.\n\nI would def. go back when it's off-peak hours.",

There were lots of options for treats ranging from cupcakes, cake slices, tarts, bars, cookies etc. So many yummy choices made it hard to choose! I had the Dolce De Leche tart and it was so rich and filling, plus the presentation was beautiful--they clearly put a lot of care into how all of their treats look as well as taste. They have espresso drinks and teas too. I got a small Matcha latte which was actually quite big, so that was a nice surprise. There is a small amount of seating inside but we were able to find a spot. The place is super bright and nicely decorated inside. All around a very cute, clean, welcoming place.

They do accept air miles so that's a positive. they should install accessible doors though for wheelchair users and strollers. a friend went there this weekend and just told us that he is never going back there... and yeah i would advise you to stay away from the bar side...stay far far away. they don't pay attention and they just stand there and chat with each other. the last time we were there the tables were filthy and there weren't very many customers there. there was us and another group playing pool and did i mention the not so clean plates and utensils???their patio?? not clean! common people do u need John Taffer to rescue you?  eeekkk....",

That would explain the large amount of square footage, but all signs for this location, both inside and outside, clearly show this is now a Dollar Tree.\n\nAlso, any store where an employee sees a long line at one register and announces he or she is opening another register to move customers along gets my approval.\n\nI would not recommend parking in the front row of spaces just outside the front door/windows because it can be dicey backing out of those spots when leaving because it is so close to a high traffic entrance/exit to the nearby road.

Unlike UPS  whose drivers are unionized and excellent drivers because they have to work at a location facility before they become drivers Fedex hires anybody that can walk and talk. Because I am handicapped I have special needs but they are totally ignored by Fedex drivers. I've had shipments put in my yard on top of my chaise lounge which is seven steps down.  You can no longer call any of their facilities directly. They have totally done away with all the phone numbers and then when you do get someone on the phon, their 800 number which is a joke you wonder how they find their way to work.  \n\nThis company is still independently owned and the owner has set this up to benefit himself. All the trucks are leased through third parties; he does not own any of the trucks at all. Smart for him, too bad for us. \n\nI currently have a lawyer looking at a lawsuit because living in California and being handicapped I should be protected from businesses that can't deliver my \npackages where I can get them safely.  \n\nI have requested from Amazon not to use FedEx at all for my deliveries because they just can't seem to get their act together.",

The door says to wait in line and they will get our names. It also says that some Yelper thinks it's a stupid system. Well yeah IM AGREEING WITH THAT OTHER YELPER. Like a good law abiding citizen our party of three patiently wait infront of the restaurant waiting for them to \"come get our name\".  I notice people who just drove up (also party of 3) walk in and a few moments later walk out. So I'm like ok maybe they were told to go back out and wait. Then this same thing happens again with a different party of 3. I follow the second group inside only to find out they were getting their names put on the list. At this point I'm just over everything and just want my damn ramen since I've been waiting for no reason for 25 mins already. I finally get our names put down and then another 25 minutes, and those two other parties of 3, later, we get called. Ordered Takoyaki (tastes great but just wish it had a LITTLE more octopus in it) also got the Black garlic oil Tonkatsu Ramen ( got everything on the side because I knew I would finish it all and didn't want my noodle to get all soggy if I wanted to eat the left overs/ broth was super refreshing and the chashu pork was delicious. The tamago for ramen is definitely supposed to be soft boiled and as someone who thoroughly enjoys YOLK PORN I was sadly disappointed. It was just a hard boiled egg sat in soy sauce for a short time period). Hubs ordered the Umami Shoyu and he said it was very tasty. Will be going back but screw waiting outside for them to \"come get you\".",

They also took a urine sample for labs, not needed to treat my condition.

By the time we got our third drink there were 3 sets of empty glasses on the table because she never took anything back. Dirty plates sat on our table from when we finished our food until when we left. We even turned the call server light on in hopes of getting her attention. That was a waste as she walked past three times without paying attention. When confronted, she told us she had been waiting the tables outside but we were sat by the window and could see that she had not been out there.

  "text": "I wish I could give this place 0 stars. Actually, the 1 star is fine because I like their concept of allowing customers to interact with the animals, but nothing else is good here. This place was  just a pet store, where it was obvious the puppies came from puppy-mills or money hungry backyard breeders. Now it's still that pet store, but it's also a rescue. DCSPCA should collect their animals.\n\nI came a few times in search for a pet for myself and another time with a friend, who actually purchased a guinea pig. Each time I came here, some animals seem to need a lot of attention, even medical assistance. I always felt sorry for this one guinea pig that looked very sickly. It sits in the  center of the \"communal\" food bowl of the guinea pig enclosure and just eats, constantly as if it's in a trance. I pet the poor thing and could feel its bones, which means it's malnourished, but it's been eating nonstop each time I've been there.\n\nMy friend purchased a rescued guinea pig. It came with a very large cage, and she had purchased the bedding and food. She had a lot of questions about maintenance and the workers were eager to answer her questions. They also gave great suggestions on products to use, until one worker helped us load the animal and its supplies into my friend's car. As we were all walking to her car, my friend asked about the amount of attention and interaction she should give it, the worker replied, \"I didn't want to say it in there because I would get in trouble, but you don't need to give it that much attention. You just have to feed it and things like that.\" Umm, isn't that still cruelty? Guinea pigs are very social creatures and absolutely love attention. He also suggested to not use that much bedding to cut costs, but that would still leave the guinea pig exposed to the hard plastic of the cage. If you have to skimp on the proper pet supplies, then you can't afford a pet.\n\nWhen we got the guinea pig home, I cleaned out it's cage. The cage was GROSS. There was dried waste caked around the sides and was very hard to get up, which is obvious that the cage was rarely cleaned. It took quite sometime to scrub it properly. The bedding was soaked in urine and the water bottle was completely empty. I refilled the water and the guinea pig began drinking immediately for a long time, which means it was very thirsty. It also seemed very proud of its newly cleaned surroundings.\n\nThe other animals such as the rats, mice, rabbits, ferrets, cats and reptiles appeared to be well cared for. The dogs were well-cared for, too. I saw the workers taking the rescue dogs out for walks, which is good. The only thing I would say is that they should clip some of the older dogs' claws,  because they are overgrown. Then again, some rescue dogs have trauma and may freak out when getting their nails clipped so maybe the workers are unable to do it.\n\nI'm also sure that little moon crab for sale was dead. It wasn't moving and it's eyes were sunken in. It looked neglected.",

  "text": "So it's a Native American-themed museum.  For those who have been to the Museum of the American Indian in Washington DC for their creative, highly regarded cafeteria, prepare to be phenomenally disappointed.  Whereas many of the offerings at the DC museum seem genuinely Amerindian-derived, the \"Southwestern\" theme here at the Eiteljorg consists of standard humdrum salads and sandwiches dressed in catchy names like Rio Rancho or Prickly Pear Cactus Salad or Mojave Valley Sandwich (portabella mushroom and cheese).  Yawn.  And even though the menu says they allow substitutions, I asked to substitute chips for something healthy like a fruit cup.  \"No substitutions.\"  What if I'm willing to pay more for it? \"No substitutions.\"\n\nI came at the peak the week day lunch hour, shortly after noon, but it was only about half full.  A line of 8 people was ahead of me to place their orders; it took 10 minutes for me to get to the front.  And then it took 32 more minutes for my sandwich to arrive.  Not even sit-down restaurants can be that pokey and expect to attract a lunchtime crowd.  The Tularosa Grilled Chicken (chicken, cheese, and may--how Native American can you get?) was actually quite tasty.  So were those chips I really didn't want to have--because I generally don't care for chips.  So the food redeems what was an otherwise lousy experience that also made me late for the second half of a conference.  Call me biased.  But honestly, the Eiteljorg from what I recall is actually a stronger, more intellectually demanding Native American Museum than the one in DC--in fact, some people just skip the museum in DC altogether and go just for the food.  But most of us don't keep coming back to museums week after week.  We do, however, go back to good restaurants, and the Eiteljorg strikes out at one of the best opportunities it might have to pull in a little extra revenue.",

My fault I admitted to tasting the bad preserve. \nI have been going there for 17 years and today will be my last. I remember years ago I had to argue a considerable amount of time with the manager when I tried to return a jar of rancid olives...why didn't I stop shopping there then?!!!\n\nGood luck competing with Trader Joe and Whole foods,  dear Global!",

If you're a fan of OPI (which I am), they have a pretty decent nail polish selection: mostly basic pinks, reds and darks. They didn't have my favorite colors Chocolate Mousse and Nomad's Dream, but I settled with some other similar colors. The staff is really pleasant and had no issue adjusting anything from pedicure bath water to my request for very thin, natural looking acrylics. \n\nThe biggest con for me was their attempt to do my acrylics while I was still getting my feet done. I can understand if I was in a rush and requested it, but I was just puzzled and told them I would get it done after my pedicure. Of course, I was sad that they didn't have my favorite colors :(\n\nThe best thing about this place is the pricing. 50$ for a mani/pedi and acrylic full set. I didn't catch my manicurists' name, but it's the only male there and he was a beast at doing my nails. Made them natural and just how I like them, and did it literally in 30 minutes with no errors.

  "text": "Why one star you might be wondering? It has nothing to do with the hotel itself. We rented a suite on the 10th floor conveniently located right across from their roof-top bar \"Jimmie's Crow Nest\" which offers spectacular view of the gulf and the marina and a stretch of downtown. Perfect place to be to experience the wonderful sunsets and they even serve up a free shot at sunset. Yet you absolutely cannot hear a sound once in your room. Room was large with comfortable beds, decent sized bathroom and a small kitchenette area. Hotel located about a 5 minute (tops) walk to the beach and Pier 60. Easy walk to shops, restaurants, bars, etc. Breakfast was okay. Sausage was good. Floppy eggs were strange. Various bread offerings and two toasters. Fresh orange juice. Terrible coffee. I mean, absolutely horrendous. I got up each morning and took a stroll to Starbucks up the street to grab a coffee and then return to have the hotel breakfast. \n\nNow the reason for the single star. The morning we left, roughly 30-40 minute ride to airport, our driver somehow failed to load one of our suitcases. Not sure how that could have happened, it being the largest of the five suitcases standing there. Nobody noticed until we got to the airport. Luckily nothing of any value in the suitcase. We called the hotel and whoever was at the desk said they'd go down to parking and look and call us back. They did, found the suitcase, and called us back. So far so good. They asked us to call back after 9am to speak with a manager. We would be in the air at that time so said we'd call back around 11am-ish to make arrangements. When we landed we called and asked if they could ship our suitcase back to us - at our expense of course. They said they could not do that. We asked if they could call their local UPS or whoever and have them pick up and ship it to us. They were unable to do that either. Essentially, the hotel refused to assist us in any way to get our suitcase back!  I have to assume that people forget items all the time. Is it then hotel policy to basically say, sorry, not our problem? Cause that's great customer service. They instead instructed us to call a local UPS to have that done. We call a few UPS shops in Clearwater but none of those we called were \"official\" UPS shops and so would not be able to send anyone to the hotel to pick up our suitcase. We needed to get the suitcase to them. Which the hotel refused to do. We finally got hold of someone at UPS \"Official\" who recommended we get in touch with someone at FedEx. Which we did. We ended up paying someone $20 to drive to the hotel and pick up our suitcase and take it back to FedEx to be shipped. My wife spent two days on the phone to make this happen. \n\nIf the hotel had been willing to lift a finger, this could have been resolved in an hour. Maybe two. And what would have easily been a glowing 5-star review ends up a 1-star review. Sad.",

The fried chicken is not a flour batter, but something else that makes it so light and crispy. \n\nThe beef stew with noodles is incredible. HUGE chunks of beef and pillowy soft carrots will send you into bliss for a bit. Ease yourself back to reality with the mango/Mexican chili smoothie. Another genius move with the combo. \n\nThe Lemongrass chicken was good, but a bit overrated. I feel that the lemongrass was a bit faint.  Pretty creative to put this Thai twist with a Vietnamese traditional cold noodle, but I'm afraid that it's more \"pretty\" than tasty. \n\nOf course, get the sticky chicken wings.

  "text": "Underwhelming and overpriced. Pizza Fusion seems to have a lot of hype and a lot of potential but it is poorly executed. I would give them 2.5 stars... most people would round to 3, but I'm sticking to two because my experience wasn't really \"A-OK.\"\n\nEven with a Creative Loafing deal AND a nightly special, I feel like we really overpaid... $27 for a large Do-It-Yourself Pizza alone. How is that possible? This is how: they don't tell you on the menu that the base pizza is $12 (I looked for pricing and there was none). They do tell you that each topping is between $2 and $4 (or more), but you would expect that to be the full cost of the pizza since only those prices are listed, leaving ours at $15 but alas it was actually almost twice that much. Dang! The final product was good, but for that price I can get three equally good take out pizzas. When you add my small white pizza to the mix, our bill was ridiculously high. I do not recommend this place unless you have a CL voucher. They are priced high assuming you will have one. Here is the link: http://www.cldeals.com/products/valid-at-pizza-fusion-downtown-tampa-25-value-2\n\nWant to know something else they don't tell you? The soda is not normal coke product. It's their supposedly organic version, which tastes like a flat diet coke with a whole cup of Truvia added to it... like a previous reviewer said, it's basically cough syrup. They really should tell us this when we order. My \"diet coke\" was so gross I cringed when I took the first sip and literally could not force myself to get it down. I have never felt that way about any other soda or drink for that matter. Trust me, I know what Truvia tastes like as I use daily it in my shakes and cooking... and I know it's better than aspartame... but this was WAY TOO MUCH TRUVIA! I was so turned off by this product. Yuck.\n\nThe service was pleasant but super slow/sparce and we watched as everyone was served before us. As for the food itself, it was alright but honestly not amazing. I wasn't blown away. Also, I ordered the wheat crust and got the regular one on my pizza... didn't make it an issue, but it added to the overall annoyances. \n\nI really wanted to like this place. I really did. But Pizza Fusion and I are not meant to be. I won't give them good reviews just because they offer gluten-free items.\n\nSummary: okay food, kinda bad service, really bad value, overall a super MEH experience.",

  "text": "This was my favorite part of our trip this past week! We really wanted to do a swamp tour and read through reviews and ended up with Cajun Encounters. We liked the idea of not having an airboat which can be super noisy and windy. \n\nA few people from our hotel were going to the same tour. The concierge came outside to ask if we were all going and said the bus had called and asked us to meet them elsewhere because it was actually too big to fit down the narrow French Quarter streets! We walked about 3-4 blocks to Canal St. to meet the full size coach bus. (Cajun Encounters offers the pick up service for an extra charge, but it's worth it for ease). \n\nThe first thing I loved was that the bus driver was super friendly, a native of NOLA. A bachelor party was being kind of bro-y in the back and she quickly shut them up with made me want to hug her. She told them the night before they were so bad she'd called the police to have them escort the guys back to their hotel...\n\nAnyway! She asked if we wanted to hear some New Orleans info on our ride down and the majority of us said sure. The ride out to the swamp was about ~40 minutes. She told us about the different areas we were passing through, the graveyards, Hurricane Katrina, stealing crabs as a teenager, etc. etc. She was really enjoyable to listen to. \n\nWe got to the Encounters spot and she gave us very clear directions on how to check in, what will happen, etc. You go inside and show the counter your ticket/reservation/phone receipt and they give you a colored stretchy bracelet (like a livestrong one). That tells you what boat/group you'll be with. We waited outside for about 15 minutes and they started calling all the groups and walking us down to the water. We (and the girls who also came from our hotel) breathed a sigh of relief when the bachelor bros were not on our boat :)\n\nOur boat sat about 25 people - two long bench type seats, each facing outward. We were on the tail end so occasionally we sat on the very front of the boat more up at water level. I don't remember our guide's name but he was informative and funny. On our tour, we saw a few alligators - the guides know where to find some favorites. We also spotted some babies, some cool herons/cranes, A BALD EAGLE SWOOPING DOWN TO CATCH PREY (so cool! So mad I didn't get a photo), and even a baby and adult raccoon! At first our tour was primarily in a wider water area and I thought \"huh, not exactly what I pictured as much\" but later on in the tour, we went past our boarding dock and went the other way and THAT'S where the swamp I was picturing was. Narrow routes - I'm pretty amazed the boat captains can steer so well to not just hit every tree in the way. A few times he'd just turn the motor off and we'd try to spot critters in the woods. I got the sweetest video of him feeding the adult raccoon - it used its little paws to grab the hot dog! (I may like animals a teeny bit). \n\nThe tour was about 2 hours total. Fantastic. It was fun, relaxing, informative, and friendly - the other people in the boat were all easy going and helped point out cool animals and spots so everyone could get photos. Definitely go to this place if you're in the area! (also look for coupons - I think I saved us $20!)",

It's BYOB, has nice outdoor seating and very nice and polite service staff! We go here often because it's in our neighborhood, it's one of our favorite sushi spots! Their food is creative and tastes super fresh! Their service is on point, the waiter we have is so nice and friendly and always makes good suggestions! You should definitely try it!!",

I can't make up my mind but I can tell you this is a good restaurant to visit if you have a group who wants Chinese food but can't decide what kind. They have all the usual lunch specials and they're very well prepared. They have several more authentic Noodle and rice dishes and some Curry's all of which that I've tried have been good. Their ribs on are the old style large red Chinese ribs... very tasty. And if you're a vegetarian and feel left out there are about 10 to 12 dishes on the vegetarian/vegan menu.",

  "text": "If you want to know the truth, Parc is the gold standard by which I compare other restaurant experiences.  It never disappoints. Everything on the menu is so perfect that I almost want to cry.  I mean, why can't every restaurant make a simple salad as elegant as what Parc offers.  For that matter, why can't I make a simple salad that is as elegant?  Even the French fries make you regret what you have stuffing in your mouth all these years.  And Philly's deluxe bakeries should be ashamed of what they have been calling a baguette. Save your white bread quota for a visit to Parc and fill up.  I especially love the warm shrimp salad: plump shrimp, slices of avocado that are ALWAYS perfectly ripe, and a beautifully dressed salad.  It's so virtuous you feel like you've earned dessert.  Oh yeah -- and another menu item that brings tears to my eye is the Bloody Mary. Why can't I make something this good????? If you think you have a recipe to rival this one, please please please share it with me.",

I was here a few weeks ago with my two young boys and we had a few bumps in the road over the course of evening with the final one being the most dramatic for my sweet 5 year old. He'd captured a large bounce ball after spending 1500 points to get it out of the giant claw machine (all 10 people in front of us got one on their first try) but nonetheless he came away with a large green ball and was SO proud! Before we could make our exit, he put it down to play air hockey and in less than 20 seconds someone swiped it! I had turned my back for only a moment. Couldn't believe it. I talked to a few people while tears streamed down his cheeks and after a few minutes, a green ball was \"found.\" The young gentlemen and a few of the ladies that helped us were so sweet to him. They turned our night back around fast. We're a few hours away, but we'll recommend to our friends and we'll be back! Treat the staff kindly please!",

They are very helpful at the register and also fast and efficient. People don't give them enough credit. The majority of my wardrobe is from H&M and I have never had a problem with items fading or shrinking in the washer and dryer. The store is usually very clean, sometimes it gets a little messy on busy days, but they can't stop customers from throwing things on the ground and messing everything up. I feel like they are constantly cleaning up after the customers. Alot of the customers need to learn some manners and has some self respect.

I had a breakfast croissant. Subbed bacon for ham- no problem at all. Had the breakfast potatoes. It was all really good. I know what you are thinking. \"Sounds pretty basic, can't really mess that up\" oh, but believe me, you can. People mess it up time and time again. There were some fresh greens and sliced tomatoes to add a little brightness too. Hubs ordered a grilled chicken sand which, cooked fresh to order- it looked really good. I heard no complaints. Coffee was good and refilled promptly. Honestly, this has been my best food experience in awhile!",

  "text": "I was looking through the YELP reviews trying to find something interesting to try.  I  stumbled onto \"Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop\".  I think my search was focused on corny names.  Anyhow, based on the good reviews, we stopped in on a Saturday evening.  Easily the best decision I made all week.\n\nThe food was awesome!\n\nThe \"Stop\"  is located in a strip mall just north of the I-10 Causeway cloverleaf.  There is a well lit sign on the east side of the cloverleaf.  If you are coming from I-10 you have a choice, You can make an illegal u-turn, dive into the right lane and pull up to the front of the restaurant.  The faint of heart can make a legal left turn, make the next two lefts and pull right up next to the strip mall .\n\nThis is a relatively small place.  Maybe 20 seats, a couple more at the bar. Decor stretches the boundaries of eclectic.....  We obviously missed the dinner rush, I think maybe 3 - 4 people were seated when we arrived.  We sat right next to the mermaid.  \n\nService was quick and friendly.  Someone I assume is Chef Ron was out a couple of times to check on us.  Nice, polite but not clingy - no war stories or life histories.  Interesting that he assumed we were from out of town (must be worldly demeanor and classic good looks).  When he found out we were from Destrehan, he commented that \"he loved to get locals in\".\n\nDown to the food - nothing short of great.  All the reviews raving about the seafood gumbo is absolutely accurate. The turkey wrap was enormous and stuffed full of real turkey.  My real find was the potato salad.  This is the best potato salad I have had in New Orleans.   \n\n$50 for 2 including drinks and tips.  I'm excited about going back and trying some of the other sides.",

And, let me tell you, it is the call of home when I have been abroad.  \n\nYears ago I lived around the corner, back when the century started with 19--.  They opened and have steadily honed their craft.  There is nothing special about the old revamped Foster's Freeze building, and do not let the fresh meat grocery smell fool you.  You are going to love it!  Yes, the burritos are Gi-normous, and cheap, and you can get rocked by the Torta plate, but let me share two secrets with you.  Order the Nachos...cause they do not get any better, and snag one of those plastic squeeze bottles of Green Salsa before you sit and feast.  \n\nNachos, considered to be a holy grail food by my friend and I are the best you can find.  Crisp chips, cheese for days, quac, scream, and we say the most chicken you can imagined plied high.  Squired with the salsa verde, you will go away fat and sassy, wondering when you will be hungry enough to come back and do it all over again.  \n\nAre you on a budget?  Cuca's is the place.  A burrito can be at least two meals.  One more mention, I know this was not the choice of the late great Julia Childs, but only because she was not aware of it yet.  If you like Mexican cuisine, try the rice.  Who ever came up with their recipe, your are a wizard!  I know I mentioned the Salsa Verde before, but let me tell you, it inspired me to go home and figure out how to make it myself...it is that good!  Kudos Cucas!  Stay the course.",

This place use all fresh fruits for their drink which I'm willing to pay a few quarters more instead of artificial powders like other places.  I recommend stopping by for their avocado smoothie with 20% sugar, since I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake, but pretty much everything on their menu is good. Staffs are very friendly so that's a plus. The only downside is that there are no seats around this place since it's a mall kiosk spot but no big deal.

While my rolls were arbitrarily one of the ones that came out fast, it seemed like most people's orders fell by the wayside and/or were forgotten in lieu of those of the AYCE-ers. Two bento boxes and a veggie roll took literally about an hour to come out, and only after walking up to the counter to inquire about the orders and multiple check-ins with our waiter. They clearly need to organize the ordering process better in general and/or reprioritize non-AYCE orders above AYCE orders; since naturally AYCE orders continue over a long period of time, it is a bad idea to wait for a lull in that in order to prepare food for others in the same group. The sushi was decent, but I am turned off from coming back again due to the inconsistent and slow service.",

  "text": "Good food, especially the nachos and brisket quesadilla! I had great drinks, for a reasonable price, a wonderful waitress, but I had a horrible experience with management. \n\nUnfortunately there was a grouchy female manager who walked in to the restroom and announced that she would be closing a tab for my myself, a friend, and my dad shortly after our meal began. My friend and I went to the bathroom on the second floor near our table. I have anxiety about touching public surfaces, especially since the start of COVID as I am immune compromised. My friend opens, closes, locks, and touches surfaces for me to help ease the anxiety when situations arise. As I began using the restroom, the manager knocked and informed myself and our guests that our tab would be closed. I said that is absolutely understandable and we would be happy to leave if it would make her more comfortable . She kept repeating that she would close the tab, which l told her was completely fine, as my guests and I just yearned for the experience of the restaurant since it opened only 3 days ago, and atmosphere more than anything, including the drinks. I really enjoyed this restaurant. The line was short for the bar, and we got in on a Saturday within 15 minutes. It was only a 30 minute wait for the restaurant, and they texted us when they were ready. I just wish management wouldn't have been so aggressive to us for using the same stall since other guests were occupying the other one, and been more understanding to mental health concerns, especially during this day in age. It seemed like it bothered her more that were using a restroom quickly one after the other than two full paying, tipping customers. Apparently for the bridal party that was ok, but not for us.\n\nOther then that, I recommended going, just don't bother using a bathroom stall with a friend. Also--don't forget to stop on the way out to the gift shop for a cute tee!",

When she arrived, worker #1 told her my car calls for full synthetic.  She called me to ask what I wanted.  I told her synthetic blend only because that's what the groupon allows for (without having to pay extra).  She told worker #1 blend only.  He said \"ok, no problem.\"  After the work is done, she received the bill from worker #2 and instead of the oil change being free with a few dollars in tax, he charged her $50 plus tax.  Why?  Well it turns out they apparently don't have synthetic blend so they decided to do full synthetic without asking or confirming with her... especially after she explicitly told them blend only.  Worker #2 ended up making excuses about how worker #1 didn't know what he was talking about.  He said they've never had that type of blend oil.  No issue, but why not talk to the customer before and confirm what he/ she wants instead of \"upselling\" the persons without their knowledge?\n\nWhat kind of auto shop does work or services without discussing with the client first?

  "text": "5 stars for cleaning, 1 star for prices (and the process).\n\nAfter researching dry cleaners on Yelp, none of the ones close to Chalfont were highly rated nor had many details written about them, so I took a chance with this cleaners who are located close to home. I took 5 dresses and a small jacket to get priced, and the lady handed me a paper quote well over $100. I was SHOCKED. I told her there is no way this is feasible, then she told me to hold on and discounted 15% to just under $100. What? When did dry cleaning become a negotiation service? Not professional. Even with the quote, it was way too high. So, I picked out my most expensive items to get cleaned, then the lady asked what I would like to pay for them. I told her there is no way they can match what I'm used to paying, told her my previous experiences, and she asked if $15 a dress was ok. Since they were expensive dresses, I said yes. Both dresses had jewels on them which were considered \"special cleaning\" so the rate was supposedly a bit higher. However, the other dresses I took home were basic black dresses and not special cleaning, but they still gave me the same rate for ALL dresses on paper, which makes the process even more shady. \n\nHere's the thing...I just moved from Dallas (Highland Park area, which is the most expensive zip code in the city, not to brag at all, but read my point), and I never paid such high prices. Most standard dry cleaners offered a flat $2-3 per piece rate. For special cleaning items, I occasionally paid up to $10 for a high-end brand at the most expensive place in Dallas, but usually $5-7 at the normal places, and they always turned out fine. The median income for Dallas/Highland Park is much higher than Chalfont, so it's difficult to believe that everyone around here pays close to $15 per piece of clothing.\n\nWhile the cleaning turned out just fine, I would not go back unless I had an expensive piece of clothing to dry clean, and even then, I'm still not sure if I would go as I felt the back and forth negotiation and haggling of prices was completely absurd. The language barrier was also high throughout this process, so that also did not help.",

  "text": "This is the first AMEX lounge I've visited. It was a quiet Wednesday early afternoon, so when I arrived to the lounge the front desk people were friendly.  The lounge is bright and modern. Certainly, geared towards the business traveler. There are not many couches or comfy chairs. \nThe bar is fully stocked with creative cocktails and a diverse wine list. I didn't look at the beer list in detail, but did notice they carried local beers on draft. The food is buffet style and Mediterranean forward. If it's not your jam, you may want to eat before heading in. I love Mediterranean so I enjoyed  the majority of the options. They have a small salad area with spring mix, beets, roasted acorn squash, tomatoes, tabbouleh, beans, and some others. For hot food there was brisket with carrrots, roasted potatoes, rice, lamb meatballs, and a squash/tomato soup. It was good, not great. They also had an assortment of cookies and a passion fruit custard that was entirely too bitter and sour. \n\nI didn't have coffee or tea, but they had some great options there. Because it was close to the holidays Santa made a brief appearance. \nNote: you can only order one drink per person. So if you're with others they will need to get their own drink. Mild inconvenience, but again the bar was wonderfully stocked. \n\nf you bring children ensure they are well-behaved as this is geared towards the business person. There's not a lot of room for them to move around. It's fairly small. \n\nI spent a good four hours there due to a delay, enjoyed the drinks and left with a full tummy. The bartenders and people clearing tables were incredibly friendly and service was prompt. \n\nOverall, good lounge experience.",

  "text": "This hotel is quite well-situated at the northern edge of the French Quarter, not far from Bourbon Street or the RiverWalk.  The rooms are standard Courtyard by Marriott rooms, though with fewer amenities than I've seen at others - no hot tub, fewer freebies in the room, no coffee maker, and so forth.  The room itself was quite pleasant, I was happy with the bed...not too hard or too soft.\n\nI did not have a chance to experience 5 Fifty 5, their onsite restaurant, but I heard from other convention attendees that it was good.  Likewise for the bar in the lobby...I heard positive reviews but did not try it myself.  I did try the lobby Starbucks (full-service, very nice) and the gift shop (almost no service, few items had actual prices on them).\n\nThe meeting facilities were fine.  Water was always available in the major rooms, although not in the smaller rooms.  If you find yourself needing to go to a \"Balcony\" room, be aware that the 4th floor is only accessible from the River Tower, not the Quarter Tower.  If you are on the 3rd floor on the Quarter side, you might happen upon the staircase leading to the 4th floor, but it's better to save time and go straight to the elevators of the River side.  Also, several bathrooms near the breakout rooms were broken, and we had to go from the 4th floor Balcony rooms to the 2nd floor Exhibit Hall just to use the bathroom.\n\nA special word of caution about the elevators.  The system is called Miconic 10, and I've never seen it elsewhere.  It's designed to move people more efficiently, and I'm sure it does move people FASTER, but it's LESS user-friendly than a standard elevator.  My biggest word of advice is: ALWAYS press your desired floor before boarding.  If you want to run and catch an elevator before it leaves your floor, you'd do better to wait...I tried this once but nobody was going to the lobby and I ended up on the 19th floor instead!  Once you are inside the elevator, there is NO WAY to control where it goes.  Press your floor BEFORE entering and go to the elevator the panel tells you to.  Also, people with mobility issues should press the little handicapped symbol first.  It will make sure your elevator is less crowded, and the doors will remain open longer.  Miconic 10 is well-suited to office buildings, but NOT hotels, so be warned!",

When the manager stops  me and my friend before we leave and harasses me about the tip that I gave AND accuses my friend of not leaving a tip, that's a problem! I'm appalled at this behavior. By the way, my friend gave a tip and so did I. Her name was Na, she said that she was the manager and she approached us initially soliciting feedback about why I gave a small tip. I told her the woman was inattentive. She went to say that the tip that I gave was not equivalent to the service that I received. Obviously, she didn't know what inattentive meant AND she was just harassing us about this tip that I gave. The young lady guided me to the chair for my pedicure and I got services that cost $100 and so did my friend. She treated me to the outing. So when I put my feet in the sink, the water was too hot. She proceeded to turn on the cooler water and me and my friend were chatting, excited about sharing this experience. I noticed that the sink was filling up, but I thought the woman was paying attention. Needless to say the sink overflowed with my feet still in the sink. (Inattentive) A lot of the workers ran over with towels to clean up the water which spilled on the floor. She didn't engage me in any conversation at all, maybe she didn't speak English. Not sure, but I've had better service elsewhere. I really didn't appreciate the harassment of the lady named NA who said that she was the manager. That's just not cool, at all!",

  "text": "If you like beer at all and are around the Philadelphia area, you really should do yourself a favor and take a trip to this brewery.  There are many interesting beers that I would actively seek out, and they come in a variety of sizes. I normally don't get excited about beer as wine or cocktails are my drinks of choice.  However, I felt differently after tasting the beers here.  I joined the UYE here last month, and I was impressed with everything about this place.  From the food, to the beer, to the service, it was a home run.\n\nI stuck with the 4 and 8 oz pours.  The 4 is great if you just want to taste something and are unsure.  The 8 is perfect for me to satisfy a craving for a particular beer.  I tasted many things I liked but my favorite was the Lil' Lady.  So tart, tangy, lemony, and refreshing which is my favorite style of beer. I also enjoyed the one that was brewed with spelt and guava, and also the experimental one with sushi rice and yuzu (Japanese citrus). I love the interesting combos going on here.  I usually only like sours, but Tired Hands proved me wrong!  \n\nService was excellent!  We had a big group of over ten Yelpers and water glasses were kept full and servers made sure we were able to order more beer when our glasses were running low.  It was also crazy crowded in there as it was a busy Saturday which made the level of service even more impressive.  In addition, the server has no problem giving our large group separate checks.\n\nThe Fermentaria serves up some tasty bar far as well.  I had a veggie burger and honestly wasn't expecting much, but it was very flavorful and the guacamole added some nice texture.  The bun was soft and fluffy (potato roll maybe?) and the fries appeared to be fresh cut.  It was a good sized portion, but not too much to where you push yourself to eat it and feel gross.  Just right!  \n\nI will most definitely return for the brews and the bites.  It looks like the draft choices are always changing, so I am excited to see what is available on my next visit!",

I also had a wonderful time at the 2017/18 New Years party. It was an affordable affair, Denise's cooking was delicious, and the music was on point. All of the staff was friendly and the drinks were strong but not too strong. I saw someone previously commented there was no coat check - if there wasn't one, there certainly is now. What I love most is the vibe. It is small and intimate downstairs with a neon theme and beer pong at the rear bar. And if you feel the need to stretch your legs, upstairs is another bar and a perfectly sized dance floor. I've been here a few times and I certainly intend on coming back.",

Arguably, the better half, but it depends on who you ask :) Personally I love both sides of the Lake, the way you can love visiting other countries as well as touring your own. I adore the minimalist look of TahoeNVLove apparel and accessories! I hope they make things for my puppy and for the beach, soon. The clothing, etc. is ethically sourced and the shirts are super soft, love it. Can't wait to see what they create next. I'm a huge fan. Also, for the non-local, the Nevada side of Tahoe is usually the coastline you see in photos, like Sand Harbor. Emerald Bay is in California. Both sides have great ski resorts and stunningly beautiful destinations, beaches, hikes, and views.",

  "text": "This place was recommended by many and i have to say it was delicious. We went on a sunday around 7:30 and it was not busy at all, only 2 other tables. We were greeted by the most friendly waitress ever. She told us the specials and gave us a few moments to decide on what to order. After looking at the menu and trying to make a decision sonce everything looked so good I decided to get a ceasar salad and chicken napalitano. My boyfriend got the mussels in white sauce and veal parm. \n\nOur appitiZers were out in no time. The aroma fron the mussels was mouthwatering. There must have been more then 3 dozen mussles in the pot and there was enough sauce leftover to dip the crunchy seeded bread in. My ceasar salad was good, usual ceasar salad with crunchy crutons, not to much dressing.  \n\nThe chicken napalitano was amazing.  It was the most tender chicken breast with so much flavor. The mozzarella was so creamy and there was a piece of prosciutto between the chicken and cheese which gave the chicken a great flavor. There was this light tomato wine like sauce and the taste was to die for.  There tomatos were so plump and the artichokes were perfect.  The flavors all went so well together. \n\nI tasted the veal parm and that was also delicious. The red saice was so flavorful, the veal so tender and breaded perfectly.  \n\nOf course I had to get dessert. There is a book to look through with about 10 pictures. I wanted to choose a little piece of everything but I decided to get the chocolate chip cannoli. The waitress said her husband makes the filling and it is not to sweet and the perfect flavor. She was right. The cannoli shell had the perfect crisp and taste. The filling was the best i have had. It came bursting out of the shell and the cannolinis big enough for 2, although i ate all of it lol. After eating all the cannoli i wanted to get another one to bring it home. Perfect cannoli i have to say. \n\nI highly recommend this little resturant for great italian cuisine.  The staff is friendly, feels like you are eating at a relatives house. One downfall is cash only.",

It seems to have an echo due to the concrete floors and high ceiling.  We ordered the Antipasto Misto for starters. It was ok.  My husband had Farfalle Alla Milanese, he seemed to like it.  I thought it was nasty!! It had an overwhelming odor of pancetta (bacon.) It was weighed down with fatty heavy sauce.  Almost like they rendered out the fat from the pancetta and the sausage and used every drop to make the sauce. YUK!  I had the Pollo Alla Gino-Vese, it was pretty good.  Slightly over cooked and salty but over all it was good.  Mine also came with a side of spaghetti (which I did not eat.  It tasted canned.) Our server was super sweet! lol She even commented on my husband's dish.  She said that she hates serving it because the smell gags her.  We had a nice time there.  We did not leave hungry and our bill was $68 and we had drinks.  Not horrible but not amazing! PS... bring a sweater because it is down right COLD in there!!",

But it is in the French Quarter, close to the action. Walking distance to Jackson Square, the antiques on Royal street, and one of the touristy cemeteries. Of course, it is also close to Bourbon, and, with a couple stops for hurricanes and souvenirs, a little longer walk to Cafe du Monde and Frenchman Street.\n\nYou pay for parking and your car is valeted. \n\nIt could use some remodelling and service could be a touch friendlier. But this is New Orleans! This hotel has its spooky parts (ask for the rooms out back above the parking lot or across from the lobby) but it is charming like NOLA itself.",

  "text": "There's nothing like eating seafood on a pier on a gorgeous weekend!\n\nMy cousin raves about the spider crab here and I finally got the chance to go to SB (my first time) to try it! The line for the restaurant was insane during Saturday lunch! We put our name on the list and it would have been over an hour wait! We decided to order at the outdoor window instead and eat outside on the picnic tables which 1.had a shorter wait 2.had the same items 3. didn't have to tip which makes me sound cheap but you will thank me when you're paying for a 5 lb spider crab!\n\nWe got some meal deal that came with 2 clam chowders, 2 salads and we chose a 5 lb spider crab to share among 2 of us. I also ordered fries to get some carbs in there. And here's the verdict:\n\nFries: Could have passed. I feel like I could have bought some at the frozen aisle of the grocery store and had the same.\n\nClam Chowder: It was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but will definitely satisfy a clam chowder craving. Had a decent amount of clams.\n\nSalad: Nothing special - just a normal leafy green\n\nAnd the infamous Spider Crab: I felt like it was good, but not amazing. First, I thought they were gonna give ONE who giant 5lb crab but they give you 5lbs OF crab. The body comes on one plate and the rest of the legs that makes up the rest of the weight comes in another plate. The shell is really thick so I definitely recommend one of those shell cracker things. The crab meat tasted fresh and it was cooked well, but the meat was too dense for me. It wasn't marinated with any flavor so if you wanted some, you had to rely on the tiny cup of melted butter or the 2 slice of lemon they give you for the whole crab. \n\nOverall, it was okay. It's a lot of work, but you do get a lot of meat. I would recommend it if you want a seafood meal on the pier. At $9/lb, it's actually not that bad of a price, but each lb does add up.",

  "text": "This is NOT a DIET restaurant. :-)  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I waited too long to check it out.  Their pizza is awesome!  It's just like a Blaze or a Pie Five in \"style\" but with better ingredients. The dough and sauce are made in house.  You can make your pizza as healthy (or yummy) as you want it.    If you don't want the dough, then make up a salad.  And don't forget the breadsticks.   :-).  They are fresh baked, not just warmed up.  \nOne difference with the other made-to-order pizza places is that you pay per-topping.  But the base price is $5.  So, for a 4-topping pizza with a half order of breadsticks (3), and extra dipping sauce and a small drink (free refills) was $12.69.   Since I had left overs, that's a pretty good price for two meals!  \nThere is ample seating inside, with a mix of high and low top tables.",

However, there is only one dingy table outside AND, it's the target blasting area of some sort of restaurant ventilation so if you look cute, keep in mind that you will leave smelling like greasy french fries which makes you less cute.  \n\nDrinks are like $10 each.

Aside from the regular standards; great quality food on the amazing salad bar, large selection of tempting meats served, etc. this establishment sets itself apart from all the rest with the star quality waitstaff they have. Their employees, from the hostess to the gauchos were outstanding from the moment we walked in the door to the time they rolled us out of there (with dessert!) We arrived early for our reservation so we patiently waited in the comfortable and convenient patio area, had a couple drinks which were conveniently added to our bill, which we appreciated versus paying multiple times. We were seated and explained the procedure of the restaurant and then the fun began. Besides the delectable meal, all the friendly gauchos and our accommodating waitstaff really enhanced the whole experience as they tended to our every need and made us feel welcome and special. It was definitely a busy night and we could understand getting lost in the mix, but there was hardly a misstep throughout the night. A manager and the executive chef also came out to ensure everything was satisfactory. Awesome experience, I will definitely recommend to my friends and return again for our next celebration!",

I had my usual 1/2 pound burger (not stuffed) with all the trimmings plus jalapinos.  My wife had the 1/3 pounder.  We split one very generous serving of sweet potatoe fries.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure how they give you so much meat at their prices ( 4.99 for the regular 1/2 pounder and 3.99 for the 1/3 pound) with beef prices through the roof.  Anyway, the burgers are cooked exactly as ordered ( medium for me and well for my wife).  The fries looked a little over done but we're not at all.  Must just be that sweet potatoe fries come out darker than I expect.\n\nThe owner usually checks on satisfaction with the customer but I cannot \nimagine anyone having much of a beef ( no pun intended).\n\nOverall, a really great place for a burger.  I will never eat any of the fast food burgers again as long as J&D is open when I'm hungry for a \"cheeseburger in Paradise\" ( apologies to Jimmy Buffett)",

  "text": "This place was *mostly* great. Our room was spacious, clean, and better than expected. (This is by no means a luxury hotel, and that's fine, because I certainly didn't feel like paying for one.) The room had a king bed, a sofa bed, and plenty of room for two rollaway beds - which was perfect since we were cramming four adult men in there. I liked that there were two TVs and a fridge. Every staff member we interacted with was super helpful and friendly. It's located within walking distance of everything we wanted to do and see downtown. Our main attraction for the trip was a concert at the Bridgestone arena and having the ability to WALK there was a real plus. Overall, this hotel offers great bang for the buck.\n\nThat all said, I did have two gripes - both of which relate to security. First, even though there is a big sign at the front desk that says \"room keys will only be given to registered guests\", one of my friends who arrived late convinced someone at the front to give him a key to my room by providing only my last name and the room number. Certainly, in this particular situation, my friend getting a room key was fine, but I can easily imagine situations where giving out a room key based on name and room number alone would be a serious violation of security. What if my friend and I had just gotten into a fight and he was seeking revenge by stealing my things? Anyway, I feel strongly that the staff should never give out room keys without proper authorization.\n\nMy second gripe was that the hotel's wifi is unencrypted. In today's world, where people get hacked left and right, this is just unacceptable and neither I nor any of my friends used the wifi during our stay. No wifi at all is better than unencrypted connections which leaves guests vulnerable to hackers.",

  "text": "It's time to update my review since I wrote it back in 2017 (when they first opened). It's still 5 stars. Wish I could give it more after multiple visits and takeout orders. This is my favorite Thai restaurant. I love that they have a separate vegan menu with way more choices than any other restaurant. I'm not vegan, but I like the option and have found many wonderful items such as the eggplant basil stir fry, veggie spring rolls, and vegetable noodle soup. Everything they make is homemade including the sauces. There are no store bought sauces with added preservatives. They cook healthy and with lots of fresh veggies even in the regular menu items. They also don't skimp on the heat level. If you ask for it, you'll get it at whatever level you want. My husband won't go anywhere else but this place for Thai food. He's a Texan who loves spicy food. He gets his beef basil stir fry in Thai hot and absolutely loves it. He was actually the first person to recommend this restaurant to me. He happened to go there during one of my hospital visits. He said Preeda warned him of the spice level, and apparently was even impressed that he ate it all with no complaints. I asked him if it was Thai Boat. The previous restaurant that occupied that space (which was also good).  He corrected me and said that it's under new ownership and called Thai Legacy. We've been going ever since that time along with my mother.\n\nWe've been to all the other Thai restaurants in the area. They are all unique in their own way. I just like this one the best because of the variety. I've come to appreciate it even more after my recent visit to the Thai temple. I was drawn to the noodle soup and the flower teas at their Sunday market. I was craving that soup during the week so I pulled up the Thai Legacy menu and noticed that they have many variations of this soup on their menu. So far, I've had the pork noodle soup and the veggie one with tofu. The pork noodle soup has 4 different noodle options (small rice noodles, large rice noodles, yellow egg noodles, or clear bean noodles) and the veggie one has 3 types (no egg noodles). I got the clear bean noodles and asked for the spice tray on the side so that I could add my own heat. The takeout soup orders come with chili pepper spice, paste, and pickled jalapenos. It's a huge portion that can definitely be 2 meals or split between 2 people. It was so good, and reminded me of my morning at the Sunday market. It so comforting and I'm so happy that I can get it Tuesday thru Sunday when needed. I was also happy to see that they are now serving exotic iced teas such as Roselle Hibiscus, Butterfly Pea Flower, and Lemongrass tea. I've had the first 2 teas and they are refreshing. It's unlimited refills during lunch.\n\nThis restaurant gets better and better each time. It's a wonderful and hard-working family that owns it. They cook with love and health in mind. The service is always friendly and welcoming. They remember us every time we come in (especially my mother). We'll continue to return often.",

Luckily I had been twice before bad or would not have gone back.  The night it was bad I happened to take 2 people who have never been I felt horrible for raving how good it was as they won't be back.  I ordered the same item I had 2 weeks prior and it was awful.  Most likely the inconsistency is in whoever is the chef that day?  Overall I would say it is good but I do agree with the other reviews that it is not as good as when it first opened and it is a weak wine pour. Great Atmosphere and outdoor tables.  The service is good and staff friendly.  Their French Onion soup may be one of best ever had and a great bloody mary.  My lunches have been better then dinners.

The server put them there and watched as i held the oysters in place while i drained the water.  When the martini's arrived there was too much room at the top of the glass.  Too much cash for too little 'tini.  The Cioppino was average at best.  Oh well, at least the biscuits were phenomenal as was the chocolate lava cake with coffee.  Definitely won't be back.",

This place really gives you the feeling of comfy/cozy meal with family /friends, but with top-notch service... like having your own personal chef in your house. Mark (chef/owner) is great. The dishes are original enough that they are interesting, but stay true to the cuisine that the restaurant is based upon. \n\nPrepare to sit, relax and enjoy a fantastic dinner. I think my favorite aspect of this restaurant is the service. I never feel rushed. It drives me crazy when a server is delivering the next course when I'm not done the one before. Never the case here. I want to enjoy my company as much as I want to enjoy my dinner, which is the norm at Da Soli. \n\nSuggestions...\n\nApps: Grilled calamari, House-made sausage\n\nPasta: Gnudi Alla Genovese\n\nEntrees: Short ribs!

  "text": "Presentation of the Place: The Bathrooms are nice. It reminds you of  an overpriced hotel that you can feel fancy in while taking a dump. The inside of the place reminds me of an amalgamation of the sets of Cheers, Sex in the City, and some French Noir.\n\nThe Food: \n\nStarter:\n\nJumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs\n\nSo, this is the first of many dishes were the common complaint is the lack of salt in the food. From the egg, filling, and crab itself, everything was void of salt or seasoning except for what was a little paprika. The textures are boring and 1 dimensional. For 8 dollars, you are getting 3 deviled eggs at the lowest effort of innovation and care. It is something with less flavor and passion than the ones you are partaking in during Thanksgiving at your grandmas.\n\nBrussels Sprouts with Garlic Aioli and Grated Parmesan.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts are cooked exceptional well, which is rare. This is ruined, by the lack of salt and seasoning again. I assume this is due to the amount of Parmesan shaved on top of the dish. This gives the dish an overwhelming umami flavor, and it forces you to reach for the garlic aioli to counter it. After about 10 bites, you begin to realize how white you are because you are essentially eating cheese and mayo. \n\n\nEntrees:\n\nRatatouille with filet\n\nNo salt on the filet on top. No salt in the dish itself. What is on the Filet is a lot of balsamic vinegar, which is overpowering. The tomato paste hasn't been stewed long enough, so the dish is really acidic especially with the amount of balsamic vinegar being used.  \n\nQuail and Boudin\n\nThis dish is weird. If you ever had a fever dream and was wondering man I wish I could eat that, this is what it taste like. The portion of boudin and quail you get is actual small for the price. Guess what the quail doesn't have on it? The fry on the quail isn't good and the breading breaks offs. The chicken gumbo taste so strange like they almost put soy sauce in it and also has notes of sour. The boudin is really good and is the oasis in this odd dish. \n\n\nDrinks:\n\n1 Bottle of the Smith and Hook. Your standard Cabernet nothing flashy.\n \nService: \n\nI usually don't critique service. I understand that we all take breaks at work, but man no water refills, the restaurant isn't busy, and people from the pass are having to bring our food. This is happening while you and your bartender friend are talking the entire time. Not a good look hombre.  \n\nVerdict: A Salty No\n\nIf you want to have a glass of wine with the girls or boys, while you look out at Poydras St. I guess this is the place for you. In my opinion, there are far better options location and culinary wise for you to go to.",

The green chiles had a nice kick. And the onion rings were decent. Three burgers, two drinks, and two orders of rings was just over $20. Maybe a tad pricey considering the drinks and rings were size small, and my mom got the little (itsa) burger.\n\nNo issues with the service. It was okay, not especially friendly.

Also been here late night for drinks, bartender was knowledgeable and attentive. \n\nBack again for lunch. Seated right away even though place looked pretty full.  Food was hot and taste great. Can't say anything particularly stood out besides the whiskey selection.  I'd come back for lunch before dinner.\n\nPork sandwich was tasty but a little dry. Flavor was very unique. Prices are expected for this area. Our server Kaillie was awesome. The gal bringing out the food acted like she didn't want to be there. Everyone seemed to be fine.",

  "text": "Fire Finch, a cute little store just off Broadway. It is a very small store, but they manage to pack it with a lot of merchandise. The upper level is clothing while the first floor is accessories, gifts, bags, ect. They carry Hobo brand handbags and wallets which is one of my favorite lines for leather goods. Some of the jewelry I found to be a bit on the expensive side. After sampling, I ended up buying a lotion by Library of Flowers...I am such a sucker for anything American made, small-batch blah blah blah. It does smell nice and the feel is luxurious so I thought it was a good buy. The girl working sat behind the counter the whole time tagging merchandise. I am not sure if she spoke at all. I wasn't sure If I was expected to do a hand signal to check out or not. I think she muttered a thank you at the end, but its questionable.",

My Cold Brew was smooth, rich with coffee flavor.  Many selections to choose from....they grind and blend Petite Clouet Coffee.\nThe coffee condiment bar had Agave syrup, simple syrup, several choices of milk products and other types of sugar/sugar substitutes.\nEverything in the cafe was absolutely top quality with affordable prices.  Outside seating, lots of seat choices inside, a very nice knowledable Barista, dog friendly and a fantastic location.....this Petite Clouet Cafe is not to be missed.\nP.S.

Walked in at noon on NFL Sunday, and two of the three bar big screens were tuned to soccer, one of the ancillary screens is tuned to soccer, and one of the ancillary screens is tuned to women's collegiate volleyball. The few screens tuned to football were tuned to the Titans, and I totally get that in Nashville, but when our server asked what game we wanted because she was willing to change the screen from volleyball, she said they couldn't do it because they don't have Sunday Ticket. This absolutely disqualifies Burger Republic as a football watching bar. Also, just putting a bunch of screens up around the place doesn't qualify it as a sports bar. Sight lines are important.

  "text": "I went here for the first time for lunch with my bosses after one of them recommended it.  The atmosphere is very laid back and almost has a beach shack feel (if that makes sense).\n\nThe menu is average size and straightforward.  I got 3 grilled fish tacos ($4 each).  I am always hesitant at paying more than $3 per taco but since it was on the company's dime I figured why not.  I have to say I was impressed.  The fish was crispy from the grill despite having the chipotle remoulade on top (always a plus), and the fillets were nice and meaty with no bones.  The red cabbage was fresh and added a needed crunch. \n\nTo me this place is the perfect spot for a quick lunch.  I would be hesitant to come here for dinner unless I was with friends doing something in the area because it doesnt stand out as a quiet dinner spot.  Theres nothing wrong that, but taquerias to me feels better suited as a communal experience.",

  "text": "First off let me just say that if I could give no stars or take stars away from other peoples reviews, I would. Thats how bad this place is. That being said, let me elaborate for you.\n\nI went into Freedom Smoke because I heard an ad on the radio for them, I wanted to see what all of the buzz was about. When I first arrived in the store, I stood in a line, I was in this line for about 10 minutes and when I got to the front, the guy at the counter said \"This is the fast lane, we only sell juice here. You have to sign in to be helped\" There was no sign, or any indication in the store that you had to sign in. There was a random book on a random table that could have easily been mistaken for a product guide. Either way, I just pointlessly stood in a line, only to be told to get into another line so I could be helped. Since this was already starting out like a trip to the DMV I already wasn't impressed but I stuck it out.\n\nKeep in mind, I went online for a long time reviewing everything vape. I like to go into situations as informed as I could possibly be, unfortunately, freedom smoke operates at a totally different way than what I researched. \n\nThe staff was rude, inexperienced, and had no real knowledge about anything they sold. There were a lot of college aged girls running the counters, unfortunately, they were not trained in anyway and came off quite hostile. I told the counter girl that I was new to this whole thing and to walk me thru the process, She couldn't tell me about the difference in tanks or batteries, all she kept doing was quoting prices. Do the prices indicate quality? \"Umm, I guess so\" was the response I got. Then she started fooling around with her cell phone, I hate that. What I hate more is when someone huffs at me, I ask a question and would get \"ugh, these are 23 dollars\" the owner of this place apparently has never ran a business before, because those are the 2 worst things you can do to a customer, not pay attention to them and treat them like they are stupid.\n\nI like to take my time looking at things, like most of us do when trying to make a decision about something you are about to buy. I felt very rushed, first off I have the counter girl acting like I am making her day the worst of her life then you have the security guards, not just any security guards, armed security guards. They very prominently show off their fire arms and they stand behind you like you are a common criminal who is about to steal something throughout the entire trip. I don't mean they stand 5 or 6 feet behind you, I mean they stand directly behind you. I don't like my personal space being invaded I also don't like being treated like a criminal.\n\nAfter I made my decisions for a tank and battery, I finally made it to the juice counter. This actually wasn't that bad of an experience. The girl behind the counter was very respectful and made me feel at ease. I asked to sample some juices \"No proble, which ones would you like to try?\" She was amazing and I really wish she worked somewhere else because this place doesn't deserve her. I rattled off about 6 different juices, I wanted to try. The girl had absolutely no issues with this, she was actually trying to make a sale, the issue I had was one of the goons was standing behind me and another one behind the counter whispered something to the girl, after that her mood changed \"  I'm sorry sir, you are only allowed to sample 2 juices\" 2 juices? what is this? I sampled a mint and a cherry, which I ended up purchasing because they didnt taste that bad. \n\nWhen I got home with my vape set up, I immediately started having issues. First, the tank started leaking, I don't mean a slow leak, I mean a steady leak, my juice in the tank depleted pretty quickly, I checked to make sure that the tank was crewed on tightly and everything was as it should be. It was, I just had a horrible tank. Next the battery lost its charge, it was about 3 hours into using it, and I had 2 major issues. The girl behind the product counter told me I should be able to puff on the battery charge for 24 hours before it would need to be recharged, so I didn't expect that. I put the battery on the charger and let it sit overnight, when I woke up the next morning, I attached the battery to the tank and found there was still no charge on the battery, the battery was defective. \n\nAfter I returned to the store to exchange the product I was told to sign in, even though there was no other other customer in the store, then they wouldn't accept my exchange because I \"must have handled the product incorrectly\" \n\nMy experience here couldn't have been worse. Since this trip I have found another store in Tucson that deals with better equipment, better product knowledge, and a friendlier staff. I would never go to Freedom Smoke again, beware.",

Looking at their menu, I was very impressed with the variety and especially with prices. Definitely not as pricey as my normal juice stop. I love that all the fresh fruits and veggies are on display also. I chose a regular sized \"garden state\" smoothie which was sweet and light. I can't wait to come back and try the juices, though. Less than 6 bucks as opposed to the normal 9/10 range? Maybe the bottles are alot smaller. We shall see. I'd also like to mention how friendly the staff was....super welcoming and informative, they seem very excited about their new business. I wish them luck and I will for sure be a repeat customer.",

  "text": "Been here a few times now. Every single experience has been wonderful!\n\nThe food and service has been exceptional each time. This last visit we enjoyed live Italian style opera singing. It was very unexpected and fun, definitely not something you typically see at a restaurant chain. \n\nEvery time we've come we couldn't leave less than a 20% tip, these waiters and waitresses are not just nice they are truly genuine. They aren't over the top, with a cheesy \"hello and how may I help you's\" only to scurry from the table as quickly as possible. They genuinely smile and make conversation, have impeccable timing and attentiveness even on a busy Friday night, and know how to make recommendations from the menu. Really wish we could note all their names individually to give them props. \n\nThe food is fully flavorful, not just salty. The bread is warm a loaded with rosemary flavor, I always request balsamic with my dipping Olive oil. Each dish has a unique flavor profile not just your typical Italian style chain where the only options are salty cheesy or salty tomato. People have complained about portion size/cost ratio on other reviews but honestly, I have never left here anything less than STUFFED with left overs for lunch the next day. We typically spend $55-$60 on two specialty drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees (my choice usually being a seafood/lobster dish) at dinner, not shabby at all when you consider the customer service, atmosphere, quality, AND quantity at that price. \n\nIf you suffered a bad experience here, I am strongly advising you give it a second/third shot and even mention your last experience to your waiter when you come in, I'm positive a place like this will make it up to you. This is probably my favorite restaurant of the moment. Totally worth the five star review I'm giving it.",

  "text": "The Starbucks on the corner of 109 St. and Jasper Ave is a busy place, both in the restaurant and outside the window. Just a short hop from the Alberta legislature, I'm sure this Starbucks is popular with government types. It's also quite close by another government employee haunt, Ricky's Grill.\n\nThe ambience is not too bad. It's nice and bright, with windows going up 15 feet. No worries about a dark, dingy space here. \n\nAll in all, it's a pretty solid location. If you're worried about noise, plug in your iPod and pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist. It's fairly laptop friendly here, but there are no large tables, so workspace is a bit limited. \n\nI took transit here, but the parking lot is free, but limited to 90 minutes. I pushed it when I parked the other day, but I don't want the hassle like I had at Northgate. Impark runs the lot.\n\nThere is some outdoor seating available in the summer months, but I'm not sure how many seats there are. There's a lot of traffic here, so it'll be noisy!\n\nBusyness - For the early morning, it's not as busy as I'd figured it might be, but it's not far from Grant MacEwan University and the Alberta Legislature, so I'm sure it sees a lot of traffic from there and the other office towers close by\n\nNoisiness - Combine a tile floor with hard surfaces, and you have a loud space. It's not too bad while I'm here, but I'm sure when all the tables are filled it can get quite noisy.\n\nAmbience - It's a comfortable location and not a bad place for a quick meeting.\n\nPower - I'm sitting tucked away in the back corner where there are power outlets directly under the bench seat. Another bench is also suitably equipped. If you're prone to wetting your pants, I wouldn't recommend these seats.\n\nFree wifi - It is available and worked as advertised.\n\nStaff - The staff here seem energetic and friendly, as is usually the case.\n\nSeating - Ample seating is available here. The tables are all on the small side, so if you plan on gathering many people for an all-day, Starbucks fuelled programming session, find somewhere else, or occupy many tables. The tables are small. The seats aren't too bad. There are two benches with power outlets underneath. There are 31 seats, but the benches can squeeze in more (shower first please!).\n\nSecurity - If you've read my other Starbucks reviews, you've probably gathered I'm a bit paranoid. You're right. Laptop thieves are everywhere! Take the appropriate precautions. I'm kind of a fan of going with an inexpensive laptop for public work. While I may like a Macbook, I'd have it chained to me in public. Could be a fashion statement.",

  "text": "I'll summarize with these categories: \nFood - Very good. \nService - Very good but hurried. \nAtmosphere - DEAFENING noise. \n\nOur first visit was this Friday evening. I had heard rave reviews so we were anxious to try it out. We had reservations and were seated immediately. The place was absolutely jammed with people. The noise level was deafening. Having a conversation without raising your voice was impossible. The hustle and bustle of waitstaff going by every second does not make for a relaxing atmosphere. Too many tables jammed into this space. \n\nOur waitress was very good and attentive. However, we felt rushed. Probably because there were so many people waiting in the bar to be seated. \n\nThe food was very good. Mussel appetizer was just ok. Good quantity of mussels, but some were still closed. The sauce was tasty but lacked chunks of tomatoes. My crabmeat & shrimp over pasta was one of the best I've ever had. Dessert was also very good. Portions for all were more than enough. \n\nIf you want good food, visit Limocello. If you want a quiet evening or a relaxing atmosphere - STAY AWAY. Maybe weekdays are better. I'm sure they could do more to cut down on the noise. The ceilings are low, but the owner has placed acoustical tiles on the perimeter to reduce noise. Something else needs to be done. It's a shame because we couldn't wait to get out of there. I'm not sure I would go again.",

  "text": "The Natural Cafe is A-OK. Located on State Street, we stopped in here on a Friday afternoon as we were strolling down to the beach. It's order-at-the-counter, and there wasn't much of a line, so the wait was quick. I ordered the fish tacos (I'm from North Texas, so any excuse to eat fish in a coastal town I'm going to take). My boyfriend ordered the tuna fish sandwich with a side salad. My mom ordered the cup of vegetable soup, and my dad ordered the nachos. \n\nOnly my boyfriend was truly wowed by his food. If he were writing this review based on his experience of the food alone, I think he probably would give them 5 stars. He loved the sandwich and the salad, and I tasted both and have to say they were great. The rest of us were okay with our meals, but not all that impressed. My fish tacos were a little strange. They were smothered in tomato sauce and cheese, and topped with lots of shredded carrot. It wasn't bad, just a little odd. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips and salsa, which were pretty good. \n\nMy mom found her soup to be too salty, and the bread served with it tasted stale to her. My dad's nachos weren't too warm when they arrived, and quickly got cold as he ate them. He found it odd that there was so much salsa and no beans at all.\n\nOverall, not our favorite spot, but a good option for a healthy meal. The place has lots of vegetarian options, which is awesome. Come here for a sandwich and salad!",

  "text": "I really hate to update this review by knocking down a star, especially when I actually thought the food here was better than last time.\n\nUnfortunately, I had a bit of an uncomfortable experience.  I brought an individual here for a job interview of sorts, and this woman is a very high ranking individual in a very prominent government role here in Tucson.  To say this was an important lunch meeting doesn't even begin to cover it.\n\nI needed a lunch spot that would not only serve good food, but also have good service and appropriate atmosphere.  The food was pretty good.  The atmosphere... well, let me tell you what happened.\n\nI was greeted by a hostess, who was a very friendly young lady.  I requested my table, and she walked me to our booth.  However, I couldn't help but notice how short her skirt was.  I'm not 100, I wasn't raised particularly conservatively, and I'm enough of a feminist to believe that women should be judged on what they wear.\n\nBut I'm also a business woman.  And frankly, it was just plain inappropriate to wear that to work.  I thought \"oh honey, you don't need to wear that to get noticed\" but I was seated and honestly didn't give it a second thought.  \n\nAfter my colleague joined me, we started our meeting and everything progressed smoothly.  We were halfway through lunch when we noticed a different hostess sitting a table across from us.  This hostess too had on an EXTREMELY short skirt.  This time, it was so short that when she leaned over I could see... well, let's just leave at London and France.  \n\nSuper, super uncomfortable.  \n\nThe person I dined with, an incredibly professional woman, stopped mid-sentence, turned and looked at me.  I thought \"oh goodness, she's going to think I took her to a TD's rather than a respectable establishment!  She's going to try and sneak out before the \"floor show\" begins...\"  It was so awkward, all I could do was apologize.\n\nSo... apparently, Champs has decided to move into a new direction?  I once recommended this place as a good spot for a business lunch, but now I would never take another colleague here.  Or my husband, for that matter I guess.  I would worry he'd choke on whatever food he was served!  Champs, I'm not sure if you're trying to court a primarily male clientele who are too classy to go to a strip club for lunch, but it was awkward and frankly unprofessional.  I hope you will consider revising your dress code for staff. \n\nSome other notes... I didn't want to argue the bill with the server with my companion present, but I did give him a coupon before my guest had arrived which was not reflected on the bill.  I also noticed that I had gotten charged for an extra drink.  Not the end of the world, but it's those little details that reflect on a place.",

Furthermore, plugging a tire leak used to be like $10 or even complimentary depending on the manager. Now, it's a whopping $32 because they \"have to\" balance the tires after plugging the leak. However, the staff is nice and the service is great. The mediocre review score is primarily about pricing.",

Some of them I believe might be in high school still, but all of them are extremely professional and I can tell they have great teamwork!! This place feels like \"home\" in a city I haven't quite gotten used to yet. \n\nThe food is always fresh and delicious. The veggie options HONESTLY taste like they did when I used to have my own garden. The meat is such great quality, I even eat it while pregnant!\n\nMy husband once got the philly cheese steak (he got his with light onions) and I tried it--amazingly delicious!\n\nNever been disappointed here! Definitely my \"go to\" place--even when I'm traveling! Love this company and I think they will be going far! No more nasty jimmy johns, there is finally a delicious place nation wide to grab a sub!",

  "text": "For my Two Hundredth review I give \"The Block\".  Cute name cute inside cute little meat case with cute little chunks of meat.  The service was not so cute.  The server wished she was anywhere but here waiting on us.  I feel your pain it is hard to work for a living.  But if you are not a people person than maybe you need to sit in a cube somewhere and not waiting on people with your lousy attitude and pathetically slow to non existent service.  What saves this place from something less than 3 stars is the food was very good.  I had their steak sandwich..  It was very good.  Odd instead of one slice of steak it was pieces of steak placed on the bread.  I almost felt it was leftovers from the butcher shop.  But style or not the steak was very good.  It had a nice punch to it from the pepper they seasoned it with and the gardinaire it was served with.  The steak sandwich came with fries so I asked for some ketchup.  It came out in one of those little stainless steel cups that was about 25% full.  So after about 2 fries I needed more.  Good luck with that.  Refer to server section of the review. \n\nMy son The Famous Chip K. was with me anid told me he had this server before and she was bad.  Oh well.  So go for the food not the service.  Really it is cute in a cute way",

  "text": "Since our experience was brunch, not the hotel itself, I hesitated to write this review. However, after reading the reviews of others, I feel our experience represents what others have said & felt so here goes. \n\nChristmas brunch: $75. We had no reservations & can now see why they weren't booked up.\n\nOnly soups were a gumbo & squash. Soup was tepid, soup \"bar\" messy. There was a large bread bar & I found a good yeasty roll. The gumbo was full of shrimp, sausage. (Later the waitress told me she could heat anything. That's nice but shouldn't be necessary.) The staff seemed overworked (we were initially led to the wrong table -- people were EATING there), but by & large tried really hard to accommodate. $75 included unlimited mimosas & my glass was never wanting. \n\nIt's hard to explain the worn, tired, outdated, rather unkept appearance. Like where we were finally seated along the wall, there were bumps in the carpet from electrical or whatever, but dust had accumulated. I even made the comment that I smelled moth balls. Hubby pointed to the, rather outdated in my opinion, cloth decorations on the tables/buffets. Made sense to me. \n\nHubby was delighted w/ the fresh oysters. Also the shrimp and crawfish. His omelette looked appetizing. Most desserts were to die for! The pralines were tasty but grainy and I've had better macaroons. My egg on artichoke was not properly cooked. The broccoli was hard, and too garlicky as was the cornbread stuffing. \n\nPictures are worth. . .",

Very relaxing,  setting a mood, the numerous lanterns and seating on cushions with low tables. Very Asian and Arabic at the same time. \n\nBut the food was horrible. The 4 of us were unanimous about our opinion of the food. Tasteless , nothing special and the simplest mango lassi too was horrible. More over the server dumped mango juice into the lassi and gave us the glass and told us to mix it with the straw. We had to ask him to turn on the candle at our table too. (It was 8pm). We asked him about a dish that was mentioned on the menu posted outside the restaurant not on the card menu. He quickly said \"yeah we can make it\" and rushed to another table where there were non indians sitting. Throughout our stay there we observed him serving the non indians and caring a damn about any desis.\n\nWe told him that the lassi was no good and he said. \"I don't know , I'll tell them inside\" .... whatever that means...\n\nWe heard him send customers away saying he is short on service. That was true ,he was the only guy waiting 8 tables aprrox. BUT. Why did such a big restaurant have just one server... ? Poor fellow seemed like a nervous reck. \n\nSo unless u want to take ur shoes off and just have a fun time criticizing the service and food do not go to this restaurant. Period.",

  "text": "We stopped by for lunch on Saturday. Our server was very helpful in describing the foods, which we were unfamilar with. Although it was very crowded, like all the restaurants in the French Quarter at noon, we got a table and good service. She didn't rush us, and it did not take too long to get our food. Unlike some of the comments below stating it was over priced, I found that to be the furthest from the truth. Seems to be everything was $12. The Po-Boys were HUGE! I shared one with my sister, and we could not finish it. My other sister ordered red beans and rice, which was very good, and another large portion, we all ended up sharing it. The burgers were also extremely large, at least 1/2 pound. The food was good, service was good, and they do not charge an automatic gratuity for 4 people. They have listed at the bottom of the bill a  gratuity calculation of 18% and 20% for your convenience. Perhaps it is for those people who stiff the server with a couple of bucks, or for people who cannot figure out what 20% of the cost is. I would recommend this restaurant.",

  "text": "I ate here for the first time when I visited Philly a couple weeks ago. It was my first BYOB experience and that was AWESOME! It's a really busy/crowded restaurant and we went for Brunch so there was no exception. Luckily my friend was able to call ahead to put our name in for a party of seven. We could track our spot on the waiting list through their text messaging system which was definitely convenient. By the time we made it to the restaurant there was only one party ahead of us. However, we still ended up waiting at least 45 minutes because it seems that there is limited seating for larger groups. \n\nWhen we finally got our table we immediately took our bottles out ready to get our drank on! The waitress opened our champagne bottle for us in the back and we ordered a couple juices to go with it. We also brought vodka, which went great with their delicious bloody mary mix. \n\nFor brunch, they had a TON of veggie options which was amazing!! The variety was great! They also have a \"Specials\" Menu which had the potential to be really cool, but it seems like it's just the same specials and regular recipes that they usually make where they just change the names of the items to a new theme. The food still looked pretty good though. \n\nI ordered the Ultimate Mexi Scramble. I was really excited about this dish as the description made it look delicious. I really enjoyed the black bean grits that came with the dish. The scramble itself was pretty good, but also a little bit too liquidy. The portion of food was large which was great because we were all starving after having waited to get a table for so long. The rest of my friends at the table seemed to really enjoy their food. \n\nI enjoyed my experience at Sabrina's Cafe for the most part. I really liked the BYOB policy. the food wasn't AMAZING in my opinion, but it was still pretty darn good. The only thing that was frustrating was the wait to actually get a table. It may be worth it for the restaurant to consider taking reservations for parties larger than 6.",

  "text": "Ordered from this deli tonight on GrubHub. I'm from Philly, house sitting for my parents, and wanted to order something that felt like South Jersey to me. So, naturally, I get a hoagie. It was an arduous process deciding where to order from because I absolutely hate driving and delivery was a must. This spot had two great reviews for Indian food which sounded interesting to me, so I gave them a try.\n\nI ordered the American cold hoagie combo with chips and a soda and a 2pc samosa. I really didn't need all that food just for myself, but after seeing the reviews about indian food, I felt a little obligated to try something other than the sandwich. I received a call from a friendly woman after placing my order that they were out of chips and the soda I requested, so she was able to substitute fries and a different soda. She also asked how I wanted the hoagie - apparently if you order without specifying, it's literally just bread, meat, and cheese! Good to know. I told her to load it up with lettuce, onion, tomato, and extra mayo.\n\nThe food came much faster than grubhub estimated. I had indicated contactless pickup, but the delivery guy still came to the door and waited for me to answer to hand off the food. He was super friendly as well, so I didn't mind. I just felt bad that I hadn't grabbed a mask before answering the door because I thought he would have put the food down and stepped away. I'm really not used to people being so friendly, haha. Philly is the city of brotherly love and all, but we are antisocial and don't like to make eye contact. This was different. \n\nThe samosas were delicious. I've never had one before so I didn't have any expectations. The green sauce smelled spicy so I used the brown sauce for dipping and I think there was cinnamon in there? I liked the crunch. It was like an Indian perogi with tons of flavor.\n\nThe hoagie was okay! Not the best hoagie I have ever had in my life, but certainly not the worst and still better than wawa. I added more mayo from my fridge. It just didn't taste like it was made with the same love as the samosas, or maybe I was so impressed with the samosas that the hoagie seemed bland? Hmm.\n\nThe fries were perfect. Super crisp and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Absolutely perfect fries for my taste.\n\nI was super full after eating everything but half the sandwich, but I am satisfied. I would definitely recommend this spot and/or try some more indian dishes if I am ever in the area with a hankering again.",

The salespeople aren't intrusive, but they're always close by if you need them. They're all very helpful and knowledgeable,  and they're all really good at helping to find just the right item for the occasion. \n\nIt's true that some of the clothing is very pricey, but those are strictly luxury items, like top-of-the-line cashmere sweaters, beautifully crafted handbags, and the like. However, they have a LOT of terrific basics, casual clothing, and mix-and-match pieces that are very reasonably priced,  and their sale rack is a dream. They have a fantastic selection of shoes, belts, and handbags that I haven't seen anywhere else. The jewelry offerings look to be carefully curated, and there are very cute pieces in a wide range of prices. \n\nThey also have a fine selection of books and greeting cards, and a fine selection of musical instruments, to boot. \n\nI don't live in Nashville, but I'm frequently here on business, and this shop will become a regular destination whenever I visit.",

Waited 45 minutes for some of the very BEST BBQ we have ever had.\nI had the 8 oz brisket sandwich, loaded tater tots and jambalaya. Brisket was tender, juicy, tasteful and plentiful. Tater tots were ok but the jambalaya was delicious!!\nWife had the smoked turkey sandwich that was very moist with a wonderful light smoked flavor.\nDaughter-in-law had the pulled pork sandwich, loaded tater tots and beans. Very tasty pork! This coming from someone who has eaten plenty of pork of the past 20 years in NC. The beans, mixed variety, were seasoned nicely. Could have cooked them a few minutes longer though.\nIf you go at lunch expect to wait and share a bench table with other patrons. I do not recommend taking a toddler as there is no kids menu nor a place for them to sit.\nWe will be back the next time we are in St Louis!",

Its parking lot desperately needs to be repainted as there are parking spots on one side of the building that really isn't wide enough to hold parking plus the traffic of cars actually driving by.\n\nThe food is really good. I've had their chicken biscuit a number of times, and find it is better than many other fast food establishments. It is many times better than McDonald's and Burger King and is just as good, if not slightly better, than Chick-fil-A's.\n\nTheir hash browns are nicely seasoned, with some different herbs included, and are very good if they are fresh and hot. Once they've sat for more than a few minutes, they become soggy and unappetizing.\n\nThey have a huge variety of donuts and are constantly rotating different seasonal specials. The donuts are generally fresh although I've gotten a stale donut or two whenever I run by during the late evening.\n\nThe service is friendly, although it is slow! If I place an order inside, they will do three or four cars before finally handing me my order. I dislike that the emphasis is placed on people in the drive-thru, and wish they would have dedicated staff for both sides.",

After ordering we all got our apps and a short time later everyone but me got their main course. The server returned after several minutes to check on us and I told her that I hadn't gotten my food. She apologized and went to check on it. A few minutes later the manager came by with a bowl of delicious meatballs and sauce. He apologized again and admitted that the order had been overlooked and gave me the meatballs to tide me over. Great! He then brought me my food (some wings if I remember correctly) in a to go box since everyone else was done eating and took the wings off the bill. He should teach a class on customer service. This is a way of doing things that simply doesn't exist anymore. Way more than I would expect for an understandable error on a busy night. Good food too.",

Because they did not have an awning or something to block the rain from coming down, I could BARELY hear the drive-thru operator through the speaker. I was straining super hard to hear (and my fiance is almost deaf in one ear so he DEFINITELY could not hear). \n\nWe ordered the pretzel burger sandwich, 4 count of chicken nuggets with honey mustard, a medium Sprite, large fries, medium Diet Pepsi, 8 count of mozzarella sticks, and an order of chicken fries with barbecue sauce.\n\nI see chicken tenders on the menu which is what my fiance wanted to order (although it said 2 count of chicken tenders but he wanted four) and the drive-thru operator said \"Do you mean the nuggets? We don't have chicken tenders\". And we were like \"...No... the tenders...\" and again she said that they didn't have those, so I was confused about that. (Unless she meant they didn't have any left in stock??) \n\nAs for the parking lot: Once you collect your food from the drive-thru window, they only have parking spots available for handicap people to park, and you're only able to turn right out of the lot. If you wanted to eat in the parking lot, you'd have to basically do a square around the corner to come back into their parking lot again.\n\nAs for the food: My fiance liked the pretzel sandwich. They unfortunately did not give him any honey mustard like what he wanted for the chicken nuggets (so he ate those plain). I was pleasantly surprised to see how big a medium drink is (it's definitely like a large in my eyes!) I'm so used to diet drinks that it should taste fairly normal, but my Diet Pepsi tasted different this time, and not in a good way, I don't know... They forgot to give us marinara sauce (which is pictured in the promo for the sticks), so we ate them plain. Finally, my chicken fries were okay, they give more than what I was expecting in the box, but I just felt that they lacked flavor. They didn't taste like anything to be honest... I had a couple of my fiance's fries and those tasted good.",

I've only been to one Panera in New York and I didn't think much of it.. but I still think it's cool that I got to visit here. If you have friends in town you should definitely take them here. Saint Louis pride. \n\nFast service at the drive through! Great for a meal on the go.",

This was my first visit here, but what I really liked was that the servers didn't make you feel bad about asking for a sample of several different ice creams before making a decision. The flavors are so odd that you have to try them to fully appreciate their flavor. The only downside was the wait to get in, but the line moved fairly quickly, and once you get inside you understand the waiting (each person getting samples). \n\nDefinitely will be going back when I'm in town, and I would highly suggest it to others!",

  "text": "I started going to this salon about two years ago and first saw Kelly, who was fantastic with both my blonde highlights and knew how to cut hair perfectly.  I would honestly get a comment every time I left her chair!  I first started going here because I could schedule everything online (major bonus points) and I kept going because of the quick, efficient and excellent results.\n\nI recently went back to the salon and saw Lori, who is new to this salon but who has done hair for years and was previously an instructor.  She was EXCELLENT.  She saw that I hadn't been to a salon in awhile and instantly knew how to fix my color.  I wanted to go a little more natural, after having gone a little too blonde at the last appointment.  She explained the process in the beginning, then as we went through the color and cut, she continued to explain what she was doing and why.  The result?  Best color I've had in... maybe ever.  She put on a glaze to help fix some of my highlights, which had faded, at no extra charge, too.  I highly recommend her to any girl with highlights, especially if one's is in need of some help/corrective color or wants a change to the status quo.",

Wings are very good.  Excellent beer selection.  A couple of the longer-term wait staff are really very good, friendly and engaging.  I agree that the host/hostess staff can be inattentive at times.

Really, the best I have ever had.  All the meats have full flavor but still stay true to the natural flavor of the meat. Proteins are cooked exactly how they are ordered. \n\nThe Pumpkin soup is delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere is great.  Decor is comfortable.  Music is right on. \n\nBut here are the downsides...\n~ We made reservations, but still had to wait for over 30 minutes for our    \n   table.\n~ We are pretty convinced they water-down some their booze.  I know that seems ridiculous, but there have been a number of times that we have ordered different things that we are very familiar with outside of the restaurant and they tasted diluted.  At first I thought we were crazy, but there was something not right.  On the upside, the staff is very nice and (although they thought we were crazy) exchanged it for something else.\n~ Service is very, very slow.  We usually enjoy taking our time and eating at a slow pace...enjoying our food and wine.  But they are very slow to take initial drink orders and to get courses out.  \n\nWe love that the establishment is Green and very local for ingredients!  The chef is very friendly and makes his way out to the dining room and greets guest, which is a nice touch.\n\nOverall, if you want great food and aren't picky about the rest go on in... you will not be disappointed!",

The restaurant was busy and crowded and the service was nice and attentive.  One thing that we didn't enjoy too much (nothing against the restaurant itself) was this party of women across the room from us, and I swear one of the women had a laugh similar to a witch's cackle.  It was hard to enjoy our dinner when she was going off every 5 minutes.  No hard feelings for people enjoying their own dinners and having a good time but I wish they were more mindful of being inside around others.\n\nWe had the crispy Brussels sprouts to begin and they were roasted to perfection.  We shared the slow cooked oxtail ragout with a side of the baked jalapeno cheesy grits.  All of the food was so good.  The oxtail was tender and the grits were also so tasty.  I would come here again to try other items off of the menu for sure.",

I would like to say that David did my nails and they came out perfect. I had black almond acrylics done and they came out so good! Right I walked in I was greeted and they told me to pick out a color. They have so many colors and you can find anything you want. The prices are perfect, actually with all the experience and how good my nails came out, you get a great deal.

  "text": "Worst 3-star+ hotel experience of my life.  My company was there Tues-Fri for a conference, I paid fir 7 rooms for my team.  1 room had barely been cleaned, with trash still in the room & pubes on toilet.  1st nite our 2000 person conference had a welcome party at Falls Bar.  2 bartenders. The bar manager stood around doing nothing, while lines stacked up.  After waiting 45 minutes for a drink with no progress we, like hundreds of others, left.  The rest of the bars/restaurants were either closed or closed early (at 10ish) leaving everyone to go off site to extend any client entertainment.  You can only blame Covid for so long-pay damn bartenders $100/hr and you still make money (a lot!). During the day, you basically had the pizza restaurant (decent and guy from Egypt forget name was nice & wonderful), the convenience store (long lines) or the Cascade restaurant buffet, WAY overpriced & mediocre at best.  The Steakhouse was the only fining highlight--good value on wine list-but when you pay $1200 (8 of us) it better be good.  At $100/nt it would be average-at $200+ simply unacceptable (and over $10k for my team). I called the Spa on Tues to ask if they had a steam room and they said yes, but failed to tell me it was 'Closed due to Covid' WTF! And only open 9am-430p (during our conference???) so no way to steam anyway when I wanted to at 7a or 5p.  Upon arrival we were talking about coming back for our Spring conference-by end of week we decided Motel 6 would be a better option in Nashville.  Again, tired of the 'Covid Excuse'. Completely unacceptable",

  "text": "My friend who goes to Boston University told me that, on my next visit, we had to go to Legal Sea Foods. Unbeknownst to me, I was destined to visit Legal way before my next trip to Boston. (forgive my theatrical and suspenseful tone... I just finished Harry Potter)\n\nThis Sunday, I had the pure joy to dine at the new location in KOP mall. I really didn't know what to expect so I will take you through my journey.\n\nThe atmosphere itself was very confusing. Legal's began as a family owned fish market that branched into the restaurant business in the early mid 1900's. The atmosphere was a weird jumble between high class dining, a homey feel and funky. It was weird. The wood tables, fixtures and decor, gave it the more expensive look. But the paper place mats and the people who worked there detracted from that classy feel. \n\nThe way the servers interacted reminded me of Fridays or a restaurant of that nature, not of a place who's cheapest entree was low $20's. Not saying that they were not very nice but they way they talked and kidded with each other while on the floor, the way that some servers had nose rings and cornrows was a bit out of place for a restaurant that was obviously attempting to go for the more high-class, expensive atmosphere.\n\nAlso, the blue and white rectangular light fixtures on the ceiling confused the atmosphere even more, giving it more of a funky, Stephen Starr look.\n\nNeedless to say, I was wary before ordering the food. I decided upon the calamari appetizer, Kung Pow Shrimp Wok and the Bananas Foster. The calamari was delicious but a tad oily from the sauce. The entree and dessert were two of the best decisions that I have made in my life. Te Wok was deliciously spicy, with pineapples and peanuts. And they were not stingy with the shrimp. It was served in a mini wok and DELICIOUS. The bananas foster was.... wow. Heaven to my mouth, a delight to my taste buds, it was AMAZING.\n\nAlso, the bathrooms were pretty cool. :)\n\nI definitely recommend Legals to anyone who is more concerned with the taste of the food, rather than the mish-mosh atmosphere.",

  "text": "What a fun community event this was.  Had I not been a Yelp judge, I may not have even bothered to go.  Sometimes we just don't take advantage of the things that are right in our own backyard (figure of speech.. this was just a few blocks away).\n\nAfter the disappointment of having an hours' delay in judging... the actual judging was fun.  Of course, it was pretty fast-paced eating.  15 wings in roughly 45 minutes is some serious heartburn waiting to happen... no matter how good the wings were.  While I enjoyed many of the flavors offered during our 4 PM tasting, I;m sad to say nothing jumped out to say \"you gotta get some of this.\"  Maybe that was in the earlier or later tastings.  I should say, that nothing was awful... they were all good, except the last two options...14 was HOT, 15 was SUPER HOT.. took one bite and put it down.  Although I did hear about a maple/bacon flavored wing (I didn't get this one).  Would I do it again.... absolutely.  A shaded place to sit under a tent, nice an comfortable, plenty of wings, water, and a couple of drink coupons to boot.  How can you go wrong.\n\nDuring the delay... what could you do.. go home or go into the casino... really what was the option.  Thanks for the delay.. I'm $300 richer (thanks Eldorado).\n\nSo get out there fellow Reno\"ites\"... live music, good eating, and the being part of the community.  Downtown Reno is no longer the scary place it used to be 10  years ago.  Once this event is over and in between the many events held during the summer... come on down, the river is flowing and there are pool areas for swimming, check our our new bridge, check out the shops in The Underground (old Post Office), and check out all the new local restaurants, and there are quite a few top notch restaurants in the Eldorado, Silver Legacy (host of the Wing Fest) and even Circus Circus.",

  "text": "We really, REALLY want to love this place but after two visits the odds are not in its favor. Since it's owned by the folks who brought us 1111 Mississippi and Vin de Set, we had high expectations but this place falls down on the little things--which many of the reviewers have noted. After the first (meh!) visit we thought it was a fluke. But 0 for 2?; shame on me if I make it 3. I think it shows how hard it is to consistently deliver a quality pie and we should appreciate even more those (few!) places in The Lou that do so.\n\nFirst the good: the interior is (mostly) awesome. Exposed brick, open kitchen, halfway between warehouse and loft space. Folks from Boston will love it! The sausage: house made fennel sausage! Awesome. The red sauce: exquisite! Just the right balance of sweet and hot (arrabiata). Loved it! The thin crust is crispy with nice bubbling, not sweet. A total absence of provel makes this a love it or hate it kinda place--depending on how you like your pie.\n\nThe bad: the lighting! This requires a serious overhaul. Can lights placed where they do no good; halogen spots shine in your eyes. Good luck reading a menu, spotting your waiter, or enjoying the sights. Go during the day if you can! The A/C will blow you out of the place. I realize this is to balance the heat put out by the gas ovens in the open kitchen but yeesh! Bring a sweater or hoodie. You'll need one!\n\nFirst time, we ordered The Wolf. Very greasy to the point of soggy. Second time, half Hawaii Five-O; half sausage, onion, mushrooms. They added the mushrooms after the pizza was cooked. They were still cold! Ordered iced tea but had to ask for sweeteners (none on table). Iced tea was off tasting and sent it back for a pear cider.\n\nMy recommendations: retool the interior with an eye toward better, user-friendly lighting and overhaul the menu in favor of a simple, quality product. The pretentions to be a gourmet pizza restaurant just aren't carried through in the uneven service and iffy food. \n\nIf I'm halfway between a Dewey's and PW's guess which direction I'll be headed?",

  "text": "I was a bit skeptical of this place from the moment it opened. One: the location seems odd to me but maybe it's because I rarely make my way to Marathon Motor village during the day time. Two: the theme. Many Nashville restaurants take advantage of garage-style doors and even have similar themes. The difference? They do it well. Garage coffee company felt more like I was there to get my oil changed than to get a solid cup of coffee. It felt like it was trying to cater a crowd that's non-existent in the Nashville coffee scene. \n\nI often tell people that I have two criteria for liking a coffee shop and it only needs to meet one of them. A) Have a great environment or B) serve a really good product. Garage does neither. Their coffee is  equivalent to a cup you may get at Starbucks, possibly even worse. Sorry, folks.",

  "text": "This restaurant review is really only about the Happy Hour.  Lately, that has been my MO.  In the summer I don't like to eat huge meals so Happy Hours work great.  It's really hard to judge a restaurant correctly this way.  So guys, just remember this was a Happy Hour review and doesn't reflect their true menu.  Went there Friday night with our friends.  It was the four of us all looking to share some delectables.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite make it for us.  We shared the Calamari which was fried but came dry without a sauce, no lemon.  It was tasty but I believe could have been better.  Also the smash burger.  I couldn't understand why they called it that.  Except that is a new term for a trend in burgers these days.  Since one is opening up in town with just that name (Smash Burger) on Grant and Swan.The burger was very plain and tasteless.  Also ordered the Mahi tacos which just got a so so for us.  The highlight was the fish and chips.  Actually, the fish was made to perfection.  Crispy, dry on the outside with a beautiful white fish inside.  I'd highly recommend that.  The fries were very plain and ordinary to say the least.  Ordered the salad on the happy hour and it was totally bland. I would come back just for the fish and disregard the chips. The service was fine.  We had a lovely, cheery server.  The place is trendy and quite lovely with the views of the mountains.  By the time we left the place was hopping mostly at the bar.  It is definitely worthwhile going to.  I love to see Restaurants do well here in Tucson. I will be back.  I'm not trying to bad mouth this place but  because I am an honest reviewer I might be coming off a little harsh.   I will be back and get the fish and try some other interesting dishes.  They do have an extensive selection of Happy Hour dishes.  Even more than other restaurants.  So certainly it is worth coming here and enjoying this trendy spot.",

  "text": "Definitely in between Minado and the typical Chinese buffet. Quality is slightly less than Minado but slightly better than the latter. The rolls are slightly oversauced but plentiful in type. There is not green tea or red bean ice cream machine, but they do have vanilla and a dessert bar. The other difference I noticed is that there are more Korean food items, and also a Soondubu bar for the enthusiast. I did not try this, so I can't comment on the taste.\n\nI do recommend the Shabu-Shabu- you tell your server and he/she brings a pot of clams (soup base) to your table. You can pick your choice of meat, seafood and veggies and bring it to your table to cook. Their shabu shabu sauce is tasty. \n\n3 stars is just about right if you choose wisely.",

  "text": "I wasn't really expecting to love Hablo Taco based on the mixed Yelp reviews, but I actually really liked it!\n\nUpon arrival, I noted a very touristy vibe in here (daiquiri machines on the walls, over the top decor, etc).  I was a bit nervous about the food due to this, but the food was actually very very good.\n\nI started with a sangria rita (2 of my favorite things mixed together).  It was a very large drink and for the size, I don't think that the $9 price tag was too bad.  We started with the sriracha guacamole (YUM) and the loaded queso (it had bacon in it) and both were very tasty.  For my meal I had the grilled avocado (filled with fresh ahi tuna and crema sauce) and the Mexican street corn.  The ahi tuna was SO incredibly fresh and the avocado was just perfect - highly recommend this dish.  The Mexican street corn was also very well done and quite scrumptious!  Everyone at my table was happy with their meals from tacos to salads.\n\nOur server was very sweet and was prompt on refilling our chips and getting us anything we requested.   Honestly, I had a very good experience here and I look forward to coming back in the future.",

She showed us some parts of New Orleans destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Gave us her perspective of what life was like before and after the disaster. Learned a lot from here.\n\nThe tour was great. Our swamp boat driver was great. Saw many alligators, and he got them to come really close too, enough for one to jump and ram its body into the side of our boat to reach the sausage/chicken he was feeding them. He was also interacting with the people on the boat, trying to get to know us, too!\n\nDriver back was good, too,\n\nDefinitely a great tour. I highly recommend!",

Upon entering I was greeted with an amazing staff and a free glass of wine. My concierge and staff was accessible by a text message and they were more than accommodating to my every need. The Hutton is also very environmentally friendly, all electricity in your room is accessed through your key card. The room is amazing overlooking the beautiful Tennessee streets, The Hutton is placed perfectly on Broadway, and is not too far away from the bars and restaurants. The ambiance of the room is stellar and creates an environment that makes you feel comfortable and at home. I never wanted to leave and at 21 years I'm considering saving up enough money just to stay here one more night. By far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had, I wish I was able to give more than 5 stars.",

  "text": "Went to Taco Bell on Pyramid Hwy across from Savemart in Spanish Springs tonight. Placed our order at 7:25pm. At about 7:35pm I asked to speak with the manager. I was informed she was busy by the guy up front. He refused to go back and let her know I wanted to speak with her. After watching several other people get there food some with extra food for the delayed service and some with just getting what they ordered our order finally came up at 7:52pm. That is a 27 minute wait for fast food. I asked again to speak to the manager. She told the gentleman who brought our food up she couldn't talk and to handle it. He informed me he was a shift leader and how could he help. I said I want to speak with the manager. When he told her she said I'd have to wait. I said there was no waiting and she could speak with me then. I started to speak and she interrupted. I told her to let me finish. My question was why was no one told in the dining room for eat in or carry out told of a long wait time and how would this be corrected? Brie  (the manager) informed me she could refund me my money. I told her I was not looking for a refund but an explanation as to why no one was told of an extended wait. She said corporate never said they had too and that there were large orders being placed inside and through the drive thru. I said that is ridiculous and that all customers should matter. The rudeness I recieved from the moment we walked in to the moment we left has left such a disgusted taste in my mouth that WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!! Corporate you need to change your management team and team members and  be there to show them what CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!!!",

  "text": "I know people generally use yelp to gush / whine about restaurants depending on their experience, but this TJ Maxx has become one of my favorite shopping places in Boise. \n\nFirst off, it's not JUST a furniture store; this is like a normal TJ Maxx with clothing, shoes, handbags plus an extensive \"beyond\" section of home goods.\n\nSecondly the store is hands down the cleanest and most organized TJ Maxxes I've ever visited. The employees are courteous and efficient (with the possible exception of the jewelry counter). The aisles are wide so you don't need to brush awkwardly past people engaged in their own treasure hunt.\n\nIn terms of prices, I feel it's very comparable to the consignment shops in the area or better. And keep in mind you are getting new clothes and a much larger selection. Of course, shopping here may be a hit or miss. Just walking through, I saw Tahari towels, hand-poured perfume candles, a few Armani / skagen watches, juicy couture jewelry, a Ralph Lauren bathing suit, some Jessica Simpson and Steve Madden bags.   \n\nBest Advice for this store: \nA. Know how to sort through junk, \n(For example, know which shirt brands are crap being sold at $1 less than a nicer mall quality. Not all $10 t-shirts are created equal)\nB. don't be afraid to explore other areas beyond your normal shopping comfort zone. For example, even though I frequent the juniors / petites section, I always glance though the men's section for ipod speakers, skull candy headphones, and other gadgets. The kids section had backpacks, colorful nail polishes, lip glosses, and juicy couture socks (too small for me, obviously, but potentially a great baby shower present).\n\nWhat I made off with:\nMichael Kors sunglasses: $20\nSet of 6 Crystal Wine Glasses: $7 (Retails for $25) \nLarge Laura Ashley scented candle $3 (Retails for about 15)\nNike goggles about $7\n\nWhat I agonized over, but ultimately walked away from:\nTahari nude patent pumps $40 \nA Keurig coffee maker\nA BCBG watch\n\nOther Impressive Collections\nAn aisle devoted to pet goods (beds, collars, other accessories), mirrors\nDisplay of Betsy Johnson earring\nReally cute wall adhesives\nA large collection of area rugs\n\nThe Tacky\nCeramic roosters, paper mache zebras statues",

I'm also not so sure why they're using chopped iceburg lettuce on the burger since chopped lettuce creates a serious bun slippage problem.

  "text": "If it were in Virginia, it'd be VA-Chinatown. And I'd come here even more. So to speak.\n\nOne thing I am certain of, is that it's more exciting that the largest city in Saskatchewan. Without doubt, you're better off in Chinatown than Reginatown.\n\nPhiladelphia has a beautiful Chinatown with little alleys and a crisscross of roads that reminds me a little bit of a slightly larger Boston Chinatown, and it's significantly better than the one in DC, but what isn't.\n\nIt's a traditional Chinatown with a big gate right in the heart of the city, which makes for a great tourist attraction. There is some really great Boba around here too, as well as some not-so-good Boba.\n\nBut I would say some of the best Boba in the Philly area is within 4 blocks of this gate, and there's plenty of amazing food located right here in Chinatown, which makes it a real destination for us, and we like it. Parking is an issue though, like at your mother's place.\n\nFor Boba try Mr Wish, KFT, Mr Camp, Tsaocaa, Tea Do (open later), and more.\n\nMy old review said:\n\nA lot of people think of NYC and San Francisco as the Chinatowns of the USA. But cities like Boston, DC, Houston and Philadelphia have wonderful Chinatowns of their own, complete with the \"gate\" and all.\n\nThe Philly Chinatown is much smaller and less-frequented than the one in NYC, but it's absolutely wonderful. It's mainly just 1 street, although technically it's several square blocks. The one street is like being in China itself, but in a Philly terraced row-houses neighbourhood setting. There's a little of everything, and if you like Chinese food and goods, you'll never get tired. There are some nice dessert and bubble tea shops along here too.\n\nPerhaps the best part is that Chinatown Philly is close to everything. It's about 10 minutes walk from the Liberty Bell and 5 minutes walk from Reading Terminal Market, which has much of the best food in town. It's one of the most notable and enjoyable little Chinese neighborhoods in North America.\n\nSo if you feel saddened or down\nI know just what will erase your frown\nWe'll both strip down naked\nSteal a car, and take it\nOut joyriding in Chinatown.",

  "text": "My husband's family has shopped here for 15+ years. My husband and I recently moved into the area and would rather give a family owned store our business. I have called twice (out of respect) to order their meat special. I called both times early in the morning and said I'd like to come pick up later in the day when it is ready. Whoever answers the phone, (seems like the same lady) makes me feel like it is a burden to order from them. She states their so busy they probably won't be able to get to it today. I understand your busy making food for businesses but then don't sell to the public. The lack of costumer service is disgraceful. I was only trying to help a business out but I see my business is not wanted nor needed. I will not return.",

  "text": "Two people can eat for $20, if they don't order drinks. I love the veggie burger. The fries and onion rings are great, too. It's a nice outdoor setting, if the weather is fine. 101 Freeway is right there, so that can be a bit noisy.\n\nThe kids behind the counter are fast, efficient and helpful. Lots of smiles.\n\nMy only gripe is that some people allow their kids to run around, with noticeably little to no supervision. We were having a really nice lunch, until a little girl (definitely old enough to know better) wouldn't let up on chasing birds. Around and around she went, terrorizing the birds.  Mommy didn't even look up. \n\nThe sandbox is a nice feature, and I noticed kids making new friends, which was sweet.",

  "text": "Of all the lunch places that I frequented during my time working downtown, Blues City deli is the place that I miss the most.\n\nThe Italian Beef with sweet and hot peppers is by far my favorite sandwich here, but the overkill of green olive tapanade on the muffeletta is a close 2nd.  Also, given how generous they are with toppings with the Blues City dog, I'd choose this place over plenty other hot dog spots.\n\nEither way, when deciding to come here, always plan for a spot to eat at once you get your food.  I think I've only eaten on location once.  Every other time was either at some picnic table elsewhere, back at the office, or just in the car, Sonic style.\n\nI think I'm going to find random excuses to grab lunch with people just to eat here.",

My favorite was the Morroy bay, however the blue point ones were also delicious. \n\nWe ordered their dinner specials and they hit the spot for craving seafood:\n\n~1/2 Maine lobster, served with onion rings and a salad - wished we ordered the full 1 & 1/2 lbs instead.\n\n~1 steamed rock crab, served with calm chowder and salad - everything about this plate is amazing. \n\nKeep in mind, this place is tiny and not a typical restaurant with fancy tables. There are counters that run along the front and back of the restaurant. We ate at the counter facing the wharf. The view was nice and relaxing even when we can see the people eating outside. \n\n\n I give this place 4 stars for the food, service, and ambiance =] good find!",

Drinks took 10 mins after we sat down and a basket of bread was offered 1/2 way through the meal... thanks but no thanks! Tiramisu Martini without the Lady Finger left the drink \"undressed\" and disappointing. The waitress took our food order but didn't deliver to the table the items she wrote down. Service was slow and unattentative. No meatball with my tortellini... and no apology for it. Chicken and Pesto special was greasy with oil floating on top. Chicken Marsala is fried and very untasty. Italian restaurant without Tiramisu as a dessert.... should've been a sign the experience would be poor. Before departing a lack luster lunch, we visited the ladies room. Passing 4 employees hanging around chatting no surprise to find 2 out of 4 stalls without paper and stuff on the floor. Skip this location unless you like your spaghetti without balls!",

  "text": "Who other to receive my very FIRST Yelp review than my neighborhood meadery? Very few cities in the Midwest have any establishments that brew and bottle ciders and mead, and we have a business that does it incredibly well right in our backyard.  New Day grants customers the option to sample six different cidars/meads for a very reasonable price and there are typically more than ten to choose from.  While you are sipping, check the menu and shelves to find some fresh meats and cheeses, cupcakes and other pallet pleasers (from other local vendors).  Beyond tastings, full glasses and growler fills are available and the owners and servers put their creative juices together to form one-of-a-kind cocktails-- Blue Velvet and Mamacita Caliente are two of my favs. \n\nThis place has become our Cheers.  It is not uncommon for regulars to be known by name, occupation, and goings-ons in their life by the owners and servers.  Whenever we have friends or family in town we take them here and they undoubtedly want to come back when they return to Indy (or have us get them a growler fill when traveling to them). Do not miss this gem of an establishment! Be ready for a clean and chill atmosphere with high probability that you will discover new tastes and new friends that you will wish you found sooner.",

  "text": "Close this review right now and start driving to The Shoppes at New Tampa.  Leave regret in your rearview mirror and don't EVER question your decision to drive the extra 17 minutes to Asian Buffet. \n\nSure it's going to cost $1 more, but that's what it takes to avoid the deep sadness I'm feeling right now.  The differences between a $7.99 and $8.99 experience are astounding:\n\nFor starters, eating in a poorly planned cafeteria setting with power cords all over the walls and very misleading food images posted in the windows as you enter VS a modest exterior and an immediate eyeful of a buffet that punches you in the face with possibilities before you're brought to one of three separate dining areas.\n\nSecondly, taking a first plate that already feels like you've settled for disappointment and shouda, woulda, coulda's VS a first plate that hasn't even scratched the surface of what looked delicious.\n\nThird, did I mention how sad I am right now??\n\nFourth, 2 servers, 1 hibachi/sushi chef and 1 buffet attendant VS more staff than you can shake a stick at.  Don't get me wrong, this place has really nice servers but something has to make up for the stingy buffet tables they can't afford to even keep half full...\n\n...and that's where I'll finish this up.  Compared to Asian Buffet, this place is a food desert and I had to fight through a scattered mess of fried or cheese covered insanity to find anything remotely Asian and/or healthy.  The move by places like this to cheapen their culinary culture to feed a bunch of fat Americans more calories than Asians will consume in a week is disgusting on so many levels.  I guess if you throw enough gawdy neon lights in a place and slap up a fish tank I'm supposed to be impressed by your exotic oriental heritage???\n\nI'm over it.  The only thing Imperial here is the amount of failure they managed to pack into a single hour of my life!",

For those who don't know me I don't mind traveling anywhere for great food. Please Note: **The five stars is strictly for the food.** I have always had good service, but I come with my half Vietnamese friends so I'm not sure if that's why. Based on other reviews, service here is hit or miss.\nI generally visit on Saturdays or Sundays so I can order their special the Bahn Xeo  since they are only offered those two days and I always have to have a bowl of their delicious pho. There is something about their broth that keeps me coming back. For those who don't really like pho, they also offer combo plates with rice with generous portions of meat and rice.

What the sign doesn't mention is that the back lot - shared with an auto repair shop - is closed with a big gate and locked at 9 PM.\n\nI had dinner here on a Saturday night, then ran an errand with a friend.  Came back about 10 to find my car behind a padlock and razor wire, in an area with a high fence (also razor-wired).  Messages left on the voice mail, Facebook posts, even a note taped to the front door went unreturned and I wound up being without my car for over 36 hours (the restaurant isn't open Sunday and doesn't open Monday until 11 AM.)  To make matters worse, I had parked near a dumpster and now the smell of spoiled food is pretty bad inside the car.  Hopefully it'll wear off soon.\n\nIf you eat here, keep both eyes on your vehicle!  I thought the Pad Thai was excellent, but based on my experience I won't be back soon.  Nobody even apologized, which I thought was the least they could do.",
