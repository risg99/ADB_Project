  "text": "No, no, no, no.....just no. My friend and I ordered the fried oysters, seafood gumbo, crawfish pasta and the soft-shelled crab to share. We ate as much as we could, left the restaurant full and satisfied, but then spent the rest of the night sick. Very sick. Like stay-in-the-bathroom-for-hours sick. I am afraid that every time I think about fried seafood, I'll remember this experience and then promptly throw up. \n\nOther than the raging sickness that descended on our trip, the restaurant was just OK. Service was friendly but awkward (why did we have three servers?) and the food was good but nothing special. We certainly had better gumbo and seafood at other points in our trip (this was a pre-food poisoning opinion).",

  "text": "I must agree with the other reviews here.  If this company isn't a scam, it sure conducts business as if it were a scam.  \nI purchased travel insurance from this company when my son was studying in China.  He contracted a stomach virus and needed brief hospitalization. \nWe filed the claim and waited... and waited....\nI called them up after about 6 to 8 weeks to see what was going on.  I was told that the review was in process and should be done within a week.  So, I am waiting again\nAfter two weeks with no word I call back and then was told that my claim hadn't been looked at yet.  The customer service rep found it and says, \"Well, this documentation is in Chinese.  We'll have to get this translated before we can look at it.\"  And I remind him that he works for an International Travel Insurance company, which means that there's a good chance supporting documentation will be in another language.  (So, if I hadn't called my claim would still be sitting in a pending pile.  This is about 2 and a half months after I submitted it.)\nSo, the claim is sent to translation and processed and about 4 weeks later I get a letter in the mail denying my claim in total.  The reason given was that it was a \"Pre-existing Condition\".  This was a one-time stomach virus.\nI sent in an appeal to this decision and waited....\nFour weeks goes by with no response.  So I called today to see where it's at and am told that no one has even looked at it.  The CSR tells me that she's going to expedite the appeal and will get back to me in a week or so.  I'm not holding my breath.",

  "text": "Wow!  The quality of food has gone down and the service has bottomed out! What's happened? I went in with two gentlemen with special needs.  I'd hate to think that this was the cause for the poor service..  The server dropped off the food and only came back if we flagged her down.  Miraculously once the forks hit the plates, to indicate we were done our meal, she ran up with the checks. We asked for boxes for the remaining food.. she ran off before we could ask for refills for our drinks.  Came back with ONE box and no bag.  We flag her down for the drinks. \"Do you want those to go?\"  First  time she actually asked us something since the food hit the table...  no,'how is your food?' No,\"would you like anything else?' No, \"Would you like a dessert?\"  We ordered dessert....after we flagged her down again.  Same \"Do you want the to go?\"  My friend finally asked, \"Do we have to leave?\"  I mean damn!\n\nOkay so then the server did not create a new check as we asked and just added it to one of the gentleman's checks.. we asked her to fix it.  She didn't. We go to pay and the gentleman was over charged.  The General Manger was called to try to fix the error and had a disgusted tone to his voice... and he turned out to not ask questions either... hmmm..  Crappy service and the quality of the food no longer supports the prices...  I'm truly disappointed since I used to enjoy this place.",

I actually feel physically ill and I think the health department should check this place out. My brothers food was dripping with orange grease, it was an omelet. I ordered the Toad in the Hole sandwich, which I used to love, and I had to take off the tomatoes and avocado. The tomatoes had white spots all over them and were yellow in the middle; they looked like they were maybe a day from being rotten, if not already. The avocado was covered in brown- grey spots. I honestly wanted to throw up after eating it. All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I don't know how it has managed to stay in business this long, and it does not deserve to stay in business. Next time you want to eat out, go somewhere else instead.",

I HAD to go there a couple of times, NO option, NEVER AGAIN. There is NO reason to speak to a customer in such a degrading way. I don't know what was going on during those months, but NEVER EVER, EVER, EVER AGAIN will I go to that pharmacy. I will change from Walgreens to CVS, Walmart, Schnucks, anywhere, there are so many that I do not need to stay with this pharmacy and no need to put up with someone's need to be disrespectful to a PAYING CUSTOMER. What these people in NEED OF POWER do not realize is that I, THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS PAYING THEIR WAGES. And if enough of me say something, that pharmacist will no longer have a paycheck. So, please be nice and have some respect for people who are paying your wages. Stop being a jerk and get off your high horse.  Two stars for the poor employees at the front desk for having to put up with the check out jerks at the pharmacy and the pharmacists who deserve NO STARS.",

I ordered some coffee (drip) and a slice of quiche. The coffee handed to me was luke-warm. The quiche was not even luke-warm...yet they asked me if I wanted it \"heated\"...\"Yes, please.\"\n\nTo top it off, we changed our mind and ended up on the outdoor patio in spite of the fact that we ordered our food to go. They made a point to tell us \"the patio is for full service customers.\" OK, I guess the 10% tip I left them for handing me a box wasn't good enough for the patio?\n\nStill, I'll give them 2 stars for their location and patio.

  "text": "My usual Cpap supplier was absorbed by Versus. They have been absolutely horrible to deal with. Me and my husband needed the supplies we were do for the month and they are trying to send us all the supplies for a three month period. Our insurance only covers certain products per month, per 3 months, per 6 months. They kept transferring me from sales to billing then billing to sales and back and forth having to explain my story each time. I was simply due an amera view cushion and disposable filters which cost me $12.16 with insurance last month they were trying to get me pay $212+. Come to find out they had not even run it through my insurance yet. This was all over 3 different calls. So very upset and frustrated. Going to find new supplier. Update: After looking at mine and my husband's EOB from Insurance Verus had over billed us both. It it took 2 months and numerous calls to get a refund. All started first of July They said check had been sent in August then in September oh check has been on managers desk to sign. Got my husband's refund of $107 still waiting on my portion. Don't do business with this company",

Apparently the restaurant never confirmed the order, so while I sat waiting for my order for over an hour, the restaurant never made the order. I was not contacted by either Eat24 (until well past the delivery time) or the restaurant (never contacted). So while I tried to figure out what was going on, the Eat24 people were impossible to get in touch with (sat on hold for 20+ minutes, messaged, texted, emailed, no response), the restaurant itself put me on hold and never got back to me.

  "text": "If the service was substandard and I give a tip according to the service, that's my prerogative. When the manager stops  me and my friend before we leave and harasses me about the tip that I gave AND accuses my friend of not leaving a tip, that's a problem! I'm appalled at this behavior. By the way, my friend gave a tip and so did I. Her name was Na, she said that she was the manager and she approached us initially soliciting feedback about why I gave a small tip. I told her the woman was inattentive. She went to say that the tip that I gave was not equivalent to the service that I received. Obviously, she didn't know what inattentive meant AND she was just harassing us about this tip that I gave. The young lady guided me to the chair for my pedicure and I got services that cost $100 and so did my friend. She treated me to the outing. So when I put my feet in the sink, the water was too hot. She proceeded to turn on the cooler water and me and my friend were chatting, excited about sharing this experience. I noticed that the sink was filling up, but I thought the woman was paying attention. Needless to say the sink overflowed with my feet still in the sink. (Inattentive) A lot of the workers ran over with towels to clean up the water which spilled on the floor. She didn't engage me in any conversation at all, maybe she didn't speak English. Not sure, but I've had better service elsewhere. I really didn't appreciate the harassment of the lady named NA who said that she was the manager. That's just not cool, at all!",

I ordered a green chile lotaburger and onion rings.\n\nI was really disappointed in the burger. I got a single patty and maybe I should've gotten a double. The patty was thin and dry, not much meat on the burger at all. The bun was huge, way too much bread. They were generous with the toppings, but a burger should feature the meat. The green chiles had a nice kick. And the onion rings were decent. Three burgers, two drinks, and two orders of rings was just over $20. Maybe a tad pricey considering the drinks and rings were size small, and my mom got the little (itsa) burger.\n\nNo issues with the service. It was okay, not especially friendly. No real response from the cashier when we mentioned it was our first time either. If I come back, I may try the breakfast burritos and hope they're better than the burger.",

Walked in at noon on NFL Sunday, and two of the three bar big screens were tuned to soccer, one of the ancillary screens is tuned to soccer, and one of the ancillary screens is tuned to women's collegiate volleyball. The few screens tuned to football were tuned to the Titans, and I totally get that in Nashville, but when our server asked what game we wanted because she was willing to change the screen from volleyball, she said they couldn't do it because they don't have Sunday Ticket. This absolutely disqualifies Burger Republic as a football watching bar. Also, just putting a bunch of screens up around the place doesn't qualify it as a sports bar. Sight lines are important.

  "text": "Hostess was unenthused about her job. With plenty of open tables our party of 5 was seated at a \"pew style\" corner booth meant for 4. Our additional person sat on the end of the table. Drinks took 10 mins after we sat down and a basket of bread was offered 1/2 way through the meal... thanks but no thanks! Tiramisu Martini without the Lady Finger left the drink \"undressed\" and disappointing. The waitress took our food order but didn't deliver to the table the items she wrote down. Service was slow and unattentative. No meatball with my tortellini... and no apology for it. Chicken and Pesto special was greasy with oil floating on top. Chicken Marsala is fried and very untasty. Italian restaurant without Tiramisu as a dessert.... should've been a sign the experience would be poor. Before departing a lack luster lunch, we visited the ladies room. Passing 4 employees hanging around chatting no surprise to find 2 out of 4 stalls without paper and stuff on the floor. Skip this location unless you like your spaghetti without balls!",

  "text": "I've been to Bridgestone arena before and knew it would be a special experience for my daughter! So I sent my 8 year old on a fun trip to watch a Preds game with her cousins. She was so excited to go to her first hockey game!! I packed her bag (small backpack because a little girl can't remember to keep a purse on her shoulder... and frankly purses are uncomfortable) with her wallet, extra sweaters, chapstick and a pair of p.j.s just in case the game ended late. When she finally got there her aunt sent me a very happy picture of her before entering. Now once she got in was an entirely different story. At the entrance she was asked to empty her bag and throw it away. They did tell my 8 year old who was now sobbing that she could walk it all the way back to the car and come back... how nice. However, that's unrealistic for a child who has hip problems to make the treck once. It was either she throw the bag away or go home (there were 4 other kids with her so home wasn't an option). So, a very sad little girl threw her bag away and sat at a Preds game with her belongings spilling over in her lap. \n\nLastly, If she brought a purse she could have walked it in. I think it's a little unfair to boys/men who wouldn't carry a purse. I think your policy is very one sided and could use relooking at. Either you make it an all around fair policy of no bags or you check bags better. There is no reason for anyone to throw their belonging away especially if it's not on your policy online! Very disappointed in how you handled things.",

Found this place and seeing it was pretty affordable, decided to give it a try.\n\nThe waitress was very sweet and attentive, but the food was horrible. \nWe ordered the falafel appetizer and 2 sandwiches. Falafel tasted a little burnt, but ok. The sandwiches were pathetic. there were maybe 3 pieces of meat in them and barely any vegs. The flavor was mediocre and not much flavor. We ended up having to order another appetizer to fill us up.\n\nThe kicker.... while we were eating my husband saw a rat run up a pipe in the kitchen. We told the waitress and got a half assed sorry and she walked away.  No manager came to the table to apologize or order any type of discount. In fact they kept looking at us, but never approached the table.\n\nI will never go back and will be sure to advise anyone thinking of going to stay away.",

  "text": "I work in the area and BLVD has been our go-to spot for drinks after work for years. Recently, the quality of the food has tanked badly. Even the truffle fries aren't good anymore. And, on numerous occasions, we've sat down for a drink and a bite and been told 5 minutes later that it is \"last call\" -- I understand places may need to close early when there's not a lot of business, but BLVD's \"last call\" can vary from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m to 10:30 p.m. We've discovered you have to ask how soon they plan to close since it can be so random (and they won't tell you unless you ask). Last week, we asked before we sat down and the server said they'd be open another hour. Then, she was cut and the bartender \"took over\" our table. You guessed it: 5 minutes later: \"Last Call.\" We asked if that meant last call for the kitchen or the bar. He said \"both.\" So, we ordered a bottle of wine (there were 4 of us). He replied, \"I said you could have one drink. I'm not opening a bottle.\" I reminded him that there are 4 glasses in a bottle -- and that TN law allows us to cork the bottle and take it with us. He was pissed. But, he brought the bottle, poured 4 small glasses and recorked it so tightly that we couldn't top off our glasses. Passive aggressive. Rude. I've given the Myint family my business for more than 20 years. Not any more.",

I had blankets and cardboard to protect my wood furniture. They pretended to use it but did not. Upon arrival in Denver I hired college hunks there to unpack. They were horrified. All my wood furniture was damaged most completed. The blankets were just thrown in. Nothing was wrapped no card board used. Metal was jammed into my wood dining set and bedroom furniture. I tried to watch but they packed it in such a way I could not adequately check. Nor should I have to. Ruined $2700 worth of furniture. Worst part the insurance claims service is a bigger nightmare. 4 months later and they have done literally nothing. I told them both I was filing a lawsuit today. The claims processing servers told me to go away and deal with the mover directly. This college  hunks location could not care less. Never use them. Ever. You will regret it. Finally the move was done so quickly it took an hour but I had to pay for two hours. This place does not care about you. At all. Go elsewhere.",

It is hazardous not to do so. PLEASE, WEAR LIGHT-COLORED CLOTHES.\nThe vast majority of people are conscientious about not blocking driveways when parking, but last night someone blocked ours. This is maddening, especially after I spent another anxious day visiting my mother in the hospital. \nAlso, thank you to those who haven't (and will not) toss empty cups and other trash on the streets.\nThe Golden Rule will make everyone's visit shine like the holiday lights you come to visit.

  "text": "My first visit was Friday 2/16/18 at Philly's 16th St. location. First impression was how messy and un-organized the prep-station was and how the employees on the food line made the food look sloppy. The young lady who made my to-go order, slopped so much juice from the condiments in my pita that it turned soggy. I just ate the filling. So I decided to try again the following week. I ordered, to-go, a salad bowl. There were 2 employees on the line. I noticed one young lady looking upset as she slopped food into the bowl of a customer before me and after she waited on that customer she left the other employee alone on the food line. So, the other employee was rushing and I didn't get the chance to get everything I wanted in my salad. The tahini sauce on my salad was so watery it looked like dirty dish water, my salad was horrible and cost me $9.67. I will not be going back. They need to re-staff, train and manage on-site.",

  "text": "A lot has changed since my 1st review back in 2015. A place that was always surrounded by a team of happy and smiling workers serving tasty food, has now transformed into workers who act annoyed to be there and treat us (the customers), like we are an inconvenience to them and serve not so great food. Their closing times are NEVER consistent. They basically close whenever they want! The last few times we have dined in on a weekday (hours before their new closing time of 8pm), where after receiving our meals we noticed they locked the doors. It was obvious because they only had 1 or 2 tables of customers they wanted to close early. Then we have to rush eat our food and take the rest home, because all the help were eyeing us down. They also now do this with \"Takeout'. We will call to place a \"pickup/takeout\" order (so it's not like they don't know we are coming), when I show up around/or before 7pm and the door is locked. After knocking several times they finally come to the door to let me in, never apologizing for the inconvenience or how they got the order wrong. Then have the nerve to ask several times if/what I want to leave as a tip just for picking up \"Takeout\". Never heard of leaving a TIP for \"Takeout\" before, wow! It's obvious the workers, have completely lost their passion for the place and compassion they used to show in their food and show their customers.",

  "text": "We went here on a whim, because we needed to go to Target nearby and we were in the mood for Italian. On a Monday night (this was New Years Day), they were surprisingly busy. We were told the wait would be 10 minutes. Not too long of a wait; I figured I could distract my toddler for 10 minutes until we got seated and the bread basket was put in front of him.\n\nThe wait seemed a lot longer than 10 minutes. I wish I took note of the actual wait length.\n\nI was also surprised to see that about 1/3 of the tables were empty despite the wait time.\n\nWe were seated and we ordered an appetizer and my son's meal right away. After we got our appetizer (buratta mozzarella with tomatoes, basil and onions) and our salads, we ordered our dinners (both pasta/seafood dishes). We dug into the bread basket and immediately asked for more, because my son likes to eat carbs by the fistful, and frankly I'll do just about anything to keep him happy towards the end of his day while we're trying to dine out.\n\nWelp, things were ok until then. It took quite a long time to get our second bread basket. My son started flipping out so I took him out of the restaurant so we didn't disturb other patrons. (I realize this has nothing to do with the actual restaurant but it's still relevant.)\n\nRight before I took my screaming son out, I told my boyfriend to ask the waitress to pack up our food to go so we could get out of there ASAP. Well, maybe a half an hour later we got our food and our check so we could leave. They kindly threw in extra salads.\n\nWe got home and I was so excited to dig into the real dinner (after putting the monster to bed). Dinner was good, but by no means was it great. I got the seafood alfredo, and my boyfriend got shrimp/scallop a la vodka. Neither of our dishes had enough sauce; both sauces seemed runny and just pooled at the bottom of our takeout containers.\n\nBetween the meh pasta dishes, the fact that my son's kid's ravioli had 5 ravioli in it (for $7, I believe...), and the incredibly slow service, we will not be going back.",

They used freshly brewed tea, and the drinks were usually on point. Then came the change of ownership. I have been back several times in the past 6 months, but never again. The last couple times I went, they didn't even bother to turn on half the lights, even though it was during business hours. There are usually only one or two employees, and even though the place is empty, nobody greets me when I walk in. They are usually sitting at a side table and look annoyed that I interrupted whatever they were doing on their laptops. The quality of their drinks have gone down as well. The tea always tastes watery and has no flavor. I even asked for no ice one time, and it still tasted like tinted water!  I mentioned it to the guy working, he said it was because they switched brands of tea or something like that. I asked if they could make something else, but he said \"it would probably be the same, but I can remake it if you really want me to\". I did. So he did. And it did. Still taste exactly like tinted water that is. Well, that was the last straw. Literally. The good news is that there are more boba places popping up in Tucson, so there is no need to cry over spilled boba.",

I was horribly embarrassed so I turned and walked away as I'm very non confrontational. On my way out this manager even crumbled paper and threw it at me.

  "text": "Okay, I want to begin by saying the waitress and host were extremely nice, honest and good people.\n\nThat said, they were out of coffee cups, but they weren't busy... Many open tables.  After an extended wait for my morning coffee they finally brought it over in \"to go\" cups.\n\nAlong with curdled cream...\n\nMy wife got a patty melt. Instead of American cheese asked for cheddar.  When they delivered the food there was no cheese.\n\nWhen it was brought back there was only a trickle of cheese dropped.  The bread was a soggy, awful mess.  Only five pieces of onion (small pieces) and the patty itself looked like it came off the kids menu, especially since the soggy bread was full size and made the patty appear even smaller.\n\nThe fries smelled of fish.  No, I'm not kidding.  Time to change the oil in the kitchen, I think.\n\nAs for my omelette, well, I can honestly say my high school cafeteria made better. \n\nI asked for bacon, mushroom, sausage and cheddar.  I think there was a half slice of bacon, the mushrooms were... Odd.  Cooked, but they seemed marinated in something that didn't go along with a breakfast menu.\n\nThe home style potatoes served with it, well, flavorless would be a step up.\n\nIn short, terrible, terrible meal.\n\nCan honestly say this was both my first and last time here.",

Also, we waited more than an hour for the virtual survey appointment to begin, and the agent never apologized for being late. The process dragged on for so long that we started to suspect that they did not want to help us move, even though the agent was polite and friendly over email.

When I went to tell the front desk they said they would send someone to fix it (never did went the weekend with out a shower and a soaked bathroom) and the TV in my room didn't work. Both occasions of asking the front desk to change rooms they were extremely rude and refused based on policy. I used to work for Hilton and I'm fully aware that was a line of lies. Not only is the staff unhelpful but you can hear through every wall and forget it if you have a wheel chair or a baby. Considering there's one elevator and your lucky if you can fit through it. I don't know how this building is allowed to be a business they should shut it down. If you're looking for the nightmare hotel in all the commercials this is it!!!!!!",

  "text": "Okay, LAWD JESUS where to start where to start..\n\nIt was a family members birthday and we decided to go to islands! We were a group of 15 and they were pretty accommodating, so that was nice.\n\nAs we waited to be seated, some of us were at the bar ordering drinks before dinner. I ordered 2 DBAs, and a tequila soda with lime. Got the check.. and WHAT the actual F?  $37.00?!?!? I tipped 3 dollars for a total of 40 dollars for 3 drinks! Oh hellll to the no. \n\nI also noticed on a sign that DBA is on happy hour for 3.50 each..so IF I am correct. 2 DBAs = $7.00. So I'm guessing my tequila soda was 30 dollars. Fair enough. ‍\n\nWhen the bartender finally came around, I asked why my three drinks came out to $37.00 he said, \"I'm not sure actually.\" Gave me and itemized receipt with the \"correct,\" amount of now 27 dollars. Which technically is still 9 dollars per drink..still not right... I look a little closer and.. they had charged me extra tequila! 7 dollars more to be exact. Asked the bartender again.. and again he says he doesn't know why. He then figures it out, hands me a receipt for 18.00 which seems right. Perfect. \n\nWe sit down, food comes out fast, which is great. My girlfriend sitting next to me asks me if my burger tastes weird, I said no but she asked me to try hers. The bun on her burger didn't taste right, so she requested a new one. Waiter asked what was wrong with it, and immediately got her a new plate of food. Another waiter came up and asked her what was wrong with it, and she apologizes and says her food will be out shortly. THEN a manager comes out, asks her AGAIN what was wrong with her food, she then replies, if you must know, \"the bun tastes a little plastic-y,\" which then the manager replies, \"DOES ANY ONE ELSES TASTE LIKE PLASTIC?\" Way to embarrass her! Funny enough, she owns a food business in the Santa Barbara area. I just found that so Incredibly rude. \n\nThis was a Friday, it's now a Tuesday and my refund is not in my account. I honestly don't care to deal with it, or go back. I'll just walk over to habit down the block if I'm ever craving a burger.",

  "text": "I cannot stress enough - MAKE SURE TO CHECK UNDER THE HOOD THAT EVERYTHING IS TIGHTENED BEFORE LEAVING THE LOT!\n\nTwo weeks ago while I was in NY my car won't start and I had to get it jumped. At that time, upon opening the hood, we noticed that the cap for where the antifreeze goes was left out and lying along the side of the well. I normally don't use the car unless for longer trips outside the area. I did however noticed that the fan stayed on even after turning the car off and locking it. I thought it was just Honda's way of keeping the car cool for idling.\n\nAnd so I took the car to my mechanic only to be told that I would need a  new battery (because the antifreeze wasn't cooling off the radiator as it was supposed and the fan had to stay on to cool it, therefore draining the battery) and an antifreeze flush because sediments appear to have gone into the engine. \n\nI have not touched or brought the car anywhere else after the service at this location. On that day I was upsold to an antifreeze top off, which I accepted. Because of this, I am very disheartened as now I had to pay $250 for a new battery and the flush when all I needed was an oil change at the time!\n\nAfter weeks of back and forth contact - the correction for leaving the antifreeze cap off causing a need for an antifreeze flush and a new battery? \"We would like to offer you one free Signature Service Oil Change for your vehicle to help conclude this matter.\" \n\nUnfortunately, I can't bring myself to return because I don't know what else will be left uncapped the next time... possibly the engine oil??\n\nThis is possibly a one off, but one time is one too many. Please be cautious and double check guys. Maybe if I did, I wouldn't have found a need to write this review to warn others.",

First, the restaurant is lying to you about having a \"Kobe beef\" sushi roll. We all know there are only 8 restaurants in the US that actually sell certified Kobe. So, they fact they choose to lie about serving real Kobe beef is disappointing to see. Second, all of the special rolls I tried were just overpowered by sauce that was smothered over the rolls. Waaaay too much. Let the fish shine, no need to hide it drenched in sauce. Lastly, the seaweed salad was downright dreadful. It tasted sour, foul and just dreadful.

  "text": "DO NOT GO HERE! Psychopath owner/average pizza......Wow, I cannot stress enough how absolutely terrible this place is! I wish I could give it negative stars. Me, my 10 year old son and 5 other of my friends all went here to grab a slice of what we have been told to be \"the best pizza in town\". I am from the area but, because there are so many pizza places around I have actually never been here. My friends are not from the area and really wanted to try what we have been told is \"epic pizza\", so we went. As we walked in, we were welcomed by the owner and 2 other employees. The initial experience seemed great! No other customers were in the shop, so we had the place to ourselves.  We ordered a bunch of food- pizzas, fries, drinks- definitely too much food but because we are all chefs, (minus the 10yr old), we had to get almost everything! Everything was going great, everyone was welcoming, outgoing, and we were all having a great time just hanging out together. Our food came out almost as fast as the bipolar mood change from the manager, Tony! One moment he was excited bragging about his establishment then out of nowhere he went completely psycho on all of us telling us to, and I quote, \"Get the f*** out of my shop or I will call the cops\"... (fast forward we all figure out that the one friend was having a side conversation while Tony was speaking and Tony got super offended that we weren't giving him our 100% full attention)... so he started cursing and threatening us with again I quote, \"I have a baseball bat in the back if you don't get the f*** out of here\"! FOR REAL?!?!! My 10yr old was hysterically crying thinking that we were going to jail and not even understanding why or what is going on. The as***** was completely oblivious to my son crying, terrified for our lives!!!! Being that we are all 30+ yrs old, everyone was just trying to calm Tony down. As for me, I was getting my son out of that place so that he didn't have to hear this man's inappropriate threats/language. As all of this is happening this guy calls the police as we are all just trying to pack up and get out of there. The police show up, ask a few questions as to what is going on, and they do not seem surprised to be there. It almost seemed like this happens often, like they were annoyed that they even had to come out. Tony was going nuts on us and to the police, so they advised that we just leave. Luckily we were able to walk away with our pizzas...so we start eating them as we walk, turns out the food was not even close to being \"epic\", it was good at best! Not even because of what just occurred but because it really just wasn't great! It almost seems like a scene out of a movie! I still can't believe how terrible this place/owner was. How this guy stays in business is beyond me! Yelling in front of a 10yr old was totally out of line, so needles to say I'll never be back and will never recommend.",

You stand on line and order your food at a counter, and you pay for it before you are served.  If you decide you want a second glass of wine you have to get back on line, order it, and pay again.  They do bring it to your table.  We had sandwiches, Meatball Parmesan and Chicken Parmesan.  The bread was on a level with (maybe a hair lower than) Subway Sandwiches.  The temperature inside was about 79º.  Uncomfortable.  The staff was pleasant and helpful, but I didn't see any reason to go back.",

Maybe one more person came in after me. It took 30 minutes precisely for 3 wings and a order of fries after I was told it would only be 15 minutes. After 25 minutes of waiting patiently I decided I was thirsty and respectfully went up for a drink. Would you believe after 25 minutes of waiting the server/cashier girl (1027 Kimberly) actually charged me for the drink lol I paid for it any how because I really was a little thirsty at that point but you would have at least thought for courtesy sakes that she would even offer up a drink for waiting such a long time for such a small order. I mean they could have thrown in an extra couple of wings in there or something AND the fries were cold. Now I'm not big on complaints so if I've actually taken the time out to write one just know I felt it was worth my time to write.

  "text": "In today's competitive hospitality environment, customer experience is paramount to a restaurant's success. My mother chose Oakley's Bistro to celebrate her friend's birthday last night, booked her reservation via Open Table and when prompt indicated that it was a birthday celebration. We enjoyed drinks and dinner. At the end of the evening, we asked about whether there was a birthday treat and the waiter said \"we can do a little something\". What he brought back was a shock and an insult! He placed an empty plate with a single lit candle and snidely said \"we don't give away free food here....\" and walked away!  We were aghast and my mother embarrassed as she had selected this restaurant for her dear friend's celebration! If there wasn't a \"birthday treat\", the waiter could have politely said, \"we don't offer anything or would you like to order something\", but to be insulted is unacceptable.  I don't know why, but we rose above, left a 20% tip and politely left. However, we'll never dine again at Oakley's Bistro and we'll be sure to share our experience that left a VERY BAD TASTE! #noneedtoberude",

Please allow 2 to 4 business days processing time after which you'll receive a tracking number from us.\" Seemed odd to get the order confirmation four days later, but OK. \n\nNo further communication after several days, so on Feb. 19, I emailed customer service for a shipping update. No reply for three days. \n\nFeb. 21, I receive this response, \"Dear Customer, We apologize for the inconvenience. We will check with the shipping dept. and update you on your order, thank you.\" \n\nI wait four more days and still no reply, so I email again on Feb. 25 asking for an update. \n\nNo reply, so on Feb. 26 I called the customer service number. The woman who answered told me that one item in my order is on back order and that's why it had not shipped. She put me on hold and came back and said the item is now and stock and my order would ship that day, and to expect an email with the tracking number. \n\nIt is now Feb. 28 and still no tracking number and no one answers the customer service line. \n\nCommunication and customer service is terrible. I should have been notified right away that one item I bought was on back order, so that I could decide if I wanted to wait or cancel. Had I not called, who knows when they would have told me. And now, there's still no information on when the order will arrive. \n\nThis seems to be a common complaint with this company, so unless you like paying for something and not knowing when you'll get it, I'd shop elsewhere.",

  "text": "I tried this place after moving to the neighborhood. It was puzzling- it was a good location, good prices, great environment, clean, so why is this place always so empty? After a couple visits it was starting to become pretty clear. \n\nYou can do everything right, but if the food isn't up to par, nothing else matters. The owner cooks everything, and the guys working there seem nice enough, but if you don't know how to make the food, or at least understand how the food is supposed to be made, you're not gonna get very far.\n\nThe first time I ate there, I ordered a lamb gyro. You would think this would be no problem as so many middle eastern places have gyros, but no. I open it up to take a bite and there were pickles! He asks me what's wrong I'm like, there's pickles on it? And he's like yeah! As if that's normal. I told him I've never heard of such a thing, all my life I've never heard of pickles on a gyro. He told me there was no more lamb so I had to settle for chicken.\n\nI decide to give them a second chance, and I order the quesadilla special. Skeptical, due to my last visit, I ask what kind of cheese is on the quesadilla. I'm told its  CHEESE WHIZ and AMERICAN. He wasn't joking. I told him just give me the cheese you use on pizza. I open it up when I get home and all the chicken is in a ball in the middle of the tortilla.\n\nThe owner might be a good businessman, have a great dining room, location, everything, but he does not understand food. ** If he would just hire a half way decent cook, this place would probably be poppin. ** A name change might be necessary though because it's hard to shake a bad reputation. I would love to be able to support their business since they're syrian and we have destroyed their country, but if the food sucks nothing else matters. Good ingredients, just doesn't know how to put it all together.",

No machine and no polish.

So I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager said \"all the wash packages are basically the same.  You just pay extra for stuff we spray on the car in the tunnel\".  OK....so, buyer be ware....if your car is basically clean....and maybe has a bit of dust on it.  This place can take care of your needs for $4 on most weekends.  But if you have any dirt or bird poop or any road grime or bugs on the grill, windshield or rims, do yourself a favor and save your money.  Do it by hand, find some other place, or at least don't let these guys sucker you into a $24.99 hand....errrrrrr wash job.  The $4 wash is basically the same.  At least, at that point, you can expect to get what you pay for.  Not much.... In the end, Ingot no apologies and nothing in return.

Also the food is underwhelming. Me and my husband got a rainbow roll that was anemic. It was so small and mostly rice. The sushi was not very fresh either and it did not have any flavor. Also the crab and cucumber salad was literally a small bowl with a couple of clumps of imitation Brad and a couple of slices of cucumber. It is the size of those free salads you get at other places, but this one costs you $5. Lastly the pork ramen is gross and not what ramen should be. I think the restaurant is going cheap on ingredients, maybe because they have an all you can eat menu. I do not know. Personally, I want substance over quantity. This should not be a Golden Corral for sushi. I will not be coming back. There are far better place that cost less. Yuck!!!!",

The mozzarella almost choked me going down; it wasn't sufficiently melted and took much mastication. All in all, it was a disappointing experience. All I wanted was a nice slice or two of pizza w/sliced mozzarella and a few toppings. What I got was a gentrified mini pizza that appeared to be made by a high school home ec student. The prices are justified by neither the portions nor the taste.\n\nOn a positive note, our server Daniella was a sweetheart and the gelato was tasty.\n\nIn the future I will avoid this place like an antibiotic-resistant STD and venture to South Philly for a decent pizza.",

  "text": "While the service from Sam was great, the prices are astronomical for tiny portions of poorly seasoned bland yet creative dishes.  I know that sounds odd so I will explain. The chef, while having an interesting creativity, lacks seasoning ability with simple ingredients--however, a deft hand with seasoning is a gift few have.  While I constantly bitch about heavily oversalted food, the reverse is also a problem PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE NO SALT SHAKERS ON THE TABLE.  Additionally, a pinch in the cooking is worth a pound at the table.  It was an unbalanced meal with two OUTSTANDING dishes and three really mediocre ones. First the star of the meal: The bacon fat fried cornbread was an interesting twist on an old favorite.  Dense, sweet cornbread is sliced and briefly grilled to a light brown crust on both sides, drizzled with a bit of honey and slathered with butter infused with the tiniest hint of thyme.  It was fabulous, but $6 for 2 slices puts it at a premium price point for a dish with a cost of about 84 cents per portion--but in all fairness, the rent in Maplewood has to be astronomical and I know that.  Everyone has to make a living, I get that, and I know the area is pricy. (Also, we were celebrating beloved husband's birthday and they gave a complimentary glass of champagne--a split of bubbly divided between 3 glasses, but since none of us like champagne it was MORE than plenty Pro Tip: there are people who don't like caviar and champagne.  It was really sweet, but if they had asked us if we wanted it, we would have declined.) Moving along, beloved hubby had the catfish with the Asian slaw in a foamy green sauce that was visually unappealing and had no real flavor.  However, he said the catfish was good but left most of the slaw and all of the sauce.  Dearest mother in law had the smoked pork sandwich with homemade chips that were perfectly cooked and salted just right.  They were the ONLY thing served to us that had correct seasoning.  She said it was good but only ate half.  I had the fried pork shoulder with black-eyed peas and collard greens which as a 5th generation southerner I like although beloved husband calls them \"boiled leaves\" which is actually what they are.  They were flavorless other than vinegar and desperately needed salt and bacon/ham to balance out the vinegar and were chewy as well. For the first time in my life, I understand why hubby calls them boiled leaves because that's exactly what they tasted like. With vinegar. LOTS of vinegar. Ptooie!  I couldn't eat them. They were disgusting. Pro Tip: Cook LONGER back off the vinegar and toss in a couple smoked ham hock and a ham bone and they will be much better.  To their credit, the black-eyed peas were not canned.  They were either fresh or cooked from dried.  They also could benefit greatly from some salt, bacon and cutting way back on the hot peppers since the peppers totally overpowered the delicate taste of the black-eyed peas. They were spicy hot but no flavor from the peas--just texture which was the only way I knew I wasn't eating a dish of diced peppers.  The pork shoulder was tender and extremely fatty--I thought it was pork belly for the first 3 bites. It had a crispy crust that was ruined by plating it in the liquid from the beans making the bottom crust soggy and gross.  If I didn't love pork fat and pork belly, it would have been inedible. To someone who doesn't love pork fat, it would be revolting.  The coating, while crisp on top, again had virtually no flavor and desperately needed salt--which was nowhere to be found. Never in my life have I been to a restaurant that didn't have salt on the table. For dessert we had the bread pudding which had to be one of the best renditions I have ever tasted.  If I were basing this review on the dessert and the cornbread there would not BE enough stars. However, the one bite I had was not enough to wash away the memory of a mediocre meal.  I doubt I'd go back.  It was a lot of money for a meal that was only JUST barely passable. They need to step up their flavor game massively--as demonstrated by the empty restaurant. I made a reservation, but I sure didn't need it.  \nThe ambience was nice but the chair and benches are painfully uncomfortable to anyone without a Kardashian booty to pad the chair!\nAlso, they have unisex bathrooms--nothing is a gross as using a men's room with piss all over the seat and floor and the stench of urine permeating the air.  They really need segregated facilities--it's the number one reason I wouldn't eat there again--I can salt the food but I'm not scrubbing the piss off the floor of the bathroom. GROSS!!!\n2 beers, 2 iced teas 2 orders of cornbread, a pork sandwich, 1 catfish and one pork shoulder and 1 dessert $99.29 before tip. \nService: 5 stars\nEntrees: 1 star\nDessert and Cornbread: 10 stars\nCleaning the urine-soaked disgusting bathroom: Ensures a 1-star review and never returning.",

They have the nerve to charge an $8.00 admission fee per person; parking is horrible; no space in between courts; have to cling to the wall navigating your way to a court so you don't get hit in the head with a ball; once you get to one of the six courts jammed together, there are two little rows of bleachers, each maybe 10 ft. long, that the owner seems to think can accommodate two teams' family members/friends.  I'm assuming these teams or the organizations that support them pay a rental fee for use of the courts (no actual fees listed on their webpage - you have to send an email to get that info) so why is it necessary to charge admission - greed is my guess.  I filed a formal complaint with the BBB.  This owner is a poor excuse for a businessman.  I feel bad for the families that have no other choice but to patronize this venue in order to see their kids play a basketball game.

  "text": "Our visit started with only a short wait, but it was a Tuesday.  We were seated with the rolls and butter.  Unfortunately, they did not include plates so we were forced to use our napkins to cut and butter them on.  The rolls are good.  The garden salad is tasty.  The grilled pork chop was over salted, under-cooked, lukewarm at best, and has a 1/4\" of fat around the edge.  The bacon cheeseburger would be better if it had cheese you could taste and some flavor.  My son, who gets cheeseburgers everywhere, said he'd rather Wayback burgers or even McDonalds or Wendy's to these.  They automatically brought my son a tiny raspberry ice tea in a kids cup without asking (clue - if the kid is playing a teen game on a tablet and ordering from the main menu, he probably doesn't need a small cup with a lid to insult him).  The raspberry iced tea has a weird flavor, as if it were way over brewed.  The manager did offer to replace the pork chop with one not salted so much, but by that point we were pretty much sick of the place.  The server didn't ask if we wanted any extra drinks, etc throughout the meal.  She arrived at the end and asked if we wanted dessert.  When we didn't, we were given a slip of paper to pay - no folder or anything to put the credit card in.  \n\nThe wait staff stood at the edge of our table where utensils are held and chatted until they had more work to do.  The sound level in the restaurant is loud, but we still had to hear their conversations.\n\nThis really wasn't worth the money paid.  The food isn't very good and the service was lackluster.  We probably won't be back.",

Their more price is $1.00 more then a few months ago and NOW they also add a 10% gratuity to your bill which I didn't know about there's a SMALL below eye level sign behind their register. I had left $4.00 tip on the table, 20+% which was MORE than generous considering there is NEVER any real service here no refills or anything. When I questioned what the \"extra\" charge was an angry/disrespectful teen \"did you leave at least 10%\" tip I said YES, I did actually 20+%.  Evidently they are charging 10% on top of your taxed total which seems pretty shady and then there is yet another sign as you enter the place which advises you that will charge you a 10-15% fee (snapped photo) if you have kids so wouldn't recommend to bring your children. So they charge 10% flat gratuity (for no service) PLUS if another 10-15% IF you have kids. SMH!!!!! These fees are pretty shady and the youth that work there, all pretty disrespectful.

Waitress had a difficult time explaining the menu and the choices available but soon we were able to take advantage of the happy hour half price entree for the shrimp but was informed that the crab legs did not qualify.  This was not explained in the ad.  We were given the usual bib but also cheap gloves.  Soon I found out why the gloves were provided.  Your meal comes in a bag dumped on your table by a very unfriendly and unhelpful \"server\" who did not even know what each person at the table ordered.  No utensils, not even a fork!  Ordered potatoes and corn.  The corn was ok to eat by hand but have you ever eaten red potatoes with your fingers?  Even though both my dining companion and I specified not spicy, the sauce was spicy and burned our mouths.  The service was sub-par and the dining experience even less.  Not going back here.

You know when you go to a craft beer/ brewery joint everything is to its highest standard type of place so coming in you had high hopes. I knew I was going to get a good artisanalish meal. \n\nThe first time yelp reviews have failed me. This was probably the fastest sit down meal I've ever eaten, we were in and out of this place in 20 min! I kid you not. Seriously I'm spending more time writing this review. \n\nI ordered Albees Knees, gin with lemon, lavender honey and lavender butters. Sounds amazing, well no it's not. What's funny is that it's the most popular ordered drink, I honestly think mine was just poorly made. All I tasted was the bitters. Uhg sent it back and I didn't even order another drink because it would be made by the same bartender, so no thank you. \n\nFor starters we ordered the mac and cheese bites and house made kim chi, we were also given their complimentary corn bread fritter drenched in their bourbon honey. I love honey and I love bourbon but these weren't good corn bread. \n\nWe got our Mac and cheese bites in less than 5 min from ordering, it came topped with what we thought was very bland tuna salad which turns to be smoked trout. It wasn't Smokey nor should it be on top of Mac and cheese bites? The Mac and cheese bites were also bland, I don't know what type of cheese was used but it tasted like it was just béchamel and then coated with bread crumbs and fried. \n\nThen the house made kim chi, simply tasted like sauerkraut. Not spicy, salty, no umami just sour. But I like sauerkraut so that's a plus. Which I didn't order, I ordered kim chi..\n\nOur mains were classic burger med rare with fries and fish and chips with Brussels sprouts. The burger patty didn't seem house made and it came out unseasoned and rare and cold, my kid said the tastiest part of that burger was the brioche bun. Although he did like the house made ketchup. \n\nMy fish and sprouts, it wasn't bad lo. I just wish the fish wasn't borderline soggy. Like it was crunchy but when you pick it up it falls apart soggy? \n\nThis place looks good and food presented well but it lacked flavors. Where is the salt, something? Was it a bad day? Did we order the wrong things? No it should all be good, right? The server knew we were not happy with anything we order, but what can he do? \n\nI wanted this to be good but this is one of those looks can be deceiving type of place. The two stars is for decor and presentation. Service was ok",

Which I didn't mind, I'm a licensed cosmetologist myself and I charge a deposit to hold the spot. However, Suite Extensions charge the full price depending on Jr Stylist or Senior Stylist and service selected. I paid for a senior stylist Chanel however, when arrived I was told that she wasn't coming in today and in fact was no longer working there. Now why would that be aonline selection if this stylist was not available? Definitely not right to charge clients a higher a cost then not given what you pay for. There was no senior stylist in today, only one girl. \n\nI gave this place a try since I heard so many good reviews. I even sent clients here when I was not able to service them based on race reviews. I managed a hair store on south street and sent clients here also just for me to try them out and get less than great service. Not professional at all. This is an industry where service matters. You can literally go anywhere. When you want to support black businesses and this happens to smh \n\n My hair was done by Siani, which I did post pics of. Once home, I had the chance to look at my hair. (Space City so I had to fix it myself). It's safe to say I didn't get my $108, senoir stylist paid hairstyle. A manager wasn't even on hand to handle this which she should have been. Her business to handle. \n\nNot returning! Or REFERRING if I'm unavailable",

Large stain on the carpet and multiple stains on a piece of upholstered furniture. \nThe fan on the heating/cooling unit was so loud that is was like driving in a car with the windows down. \nMost upsetting was the mattress. In all our years of traveling, we have NEVER had to sleep on such a terrible mattress. It sounded and felt like the mattress was stuffed with straw. Both my husband and I struggled to sleep because it was so uncomfortable that it became painful. I seriously considered sleeping in my car instead!! \nThe free continental breakfast consists of one croissant, juice and coffee or tea per person and has to be served in the room. Don't waste your time. Plenty of nice restaurants in the area to eat. Sadly, we didn't rest well and the stay at this inn ruined the weekend. We returned home exhausted from our inability to get a restful nights sleep. \nOur two night stay, with taxes, was just over $500.00.  Surely they can provide a more appropriate accommodation at that price point.",

We usually only go in Thursday's for the boneless wing night. I didn't go back for almost two months after I got bad rubbery chicken a few months ago. Restaurant is constantly dirty with dishes and food left on tables after customers have left. This branch needs to take a serious step up. Definitely below normal bdubs standards",

  "text": "I gave  a 3 star because it's  NOT SAFE and way to expensive to get in and way to crowded..\nThey bus a bunch of people in everyday. There is a lot better water parks and cheaper. And they try and force you to pay high prices on food also and it has restaurant logo but food tastes nothing like restaurant they claim it is. And pizza was burnt. I live super close but I'm not going back here again!!! I feel it's not safe here way to many tubes can't see drowning child under tubes. And they let tubes stay in lazy river with no one on them..Not good at all. It hasn't happened yet but it's a matter of time. I know a child that did drowned under a blow up raft. Not safe at all. A child did almost drowned when I was there !!! If it hadn't been for lifeguard Super Sam that child would of been dead!!! This place is at mercy of lifeguards....\n\n I feel like they try and make you pay their high prices on food. You can't bring food or drinks in to swimming pool area. Really but you want to charge 7.00 for a hot dog band chips or 5.00 for a chicken sandwich that's being forced. How can a parent afford that with a lot of kids. That's just wrong. Parents out smart them bring your cooler with ice and put drinks and stuff for lunches and snacks than have a designated time to go out and eat lunch. I did that at a different pool when my child was little and I had neighbors kids with us. I found a picnic table and we spread everything out. And she is 26 and remembers and talks about how fun the picnic was everyday at the pool.now she does same with her daughter. I will say this they have a life guard who deserves a medal he was lighting fast and save a kids life yesterday. His name was SAM. Little boy fell off his tube in lazy river all these adults around no one noticed he came across from other side like super man and had the kid pulled out . All the adults freaked out cuz no one saw the child under water all we saw was a empty tube. And the child's parents were no where to be found.. really parents your children are your responsibility not the life guards or anyone else's.this kids was probably 4 and his buddy 5 years old ... watch your kids to a water park or pool is not your babysitter.....thank God for SAM...The sad part is they do provide free use of life jackets and some parents are to lazy to walk right over and get them and put them on the kids.when my kids would argue they didn't want to wear it,I would tell them it's simple you put it on or you go home your choice. Remember your the parents and they are the child !!! You set the rules not them!!!!!! I have to agree with other reviews this park is way over priced cheaper and better water parks like in Plainfield it's even in doors so kids don't get burnt. I only went here cuz it was free for me cuz my friend had a pass it is to packed and way to expensive.",

Got to this place about 8:45am. They took the keys at about 9am. I left the store, went and walked around Walmart for an hour. I came back, car still sitting in the same spot. It wasn't busy at all. Maybe 1 or 2 cars were there before mine. It wasn't until I ask for my keys that they decided they were gonna bring my car back, no thanks. I'll take my money somewhere else. Tires and a oil change shouldn't take hours to complete especially with a name like Tires Plus? Made an appointment with a different store only because they carry a certain tire I want. Hopefully this next store will be more professional.",

  "text": "Stuck between a 2 and a 3 on this one, but I am going to go ahead and give it a 2 based on the fact that it was one of the strangest dining experiences I've had. My hubby (Adam) and I were in town for the day visiting our friends. We were doing a pub crawl with them starting off at the bar next door, so we all decided to come here. I was very impressed when we walked in. The restaurant was so big, and I thought it was very unique looking. The food has to be awesome, right? My friend and I ordered the cotton candy limeade, and it was delish! The food prices were overly reasonable. I was in love (besides for the weird waiter)! I couldn't wait for the food. Right off the bat though.. our server was pretty arrogant. I think maybe he got his training at DIck's Last Resort next door lol. Adam and I ordered their Sicilian cheese bread with pepperonis as an appetizer and decided to split the spaghetti and meatsauce as our meal (which comes with a salad). The cheese bread came out with no pepperonis... we ate it anyway and it was okay. Nothing special. I told the waiter about the pepperonis when he asked how everything was, and he joked that he ate them. Anyway, the salads weren't great. We had asked our waiter what their most popular dressing is, and he said the Pesto one. It tasted like watered down Caesar. At this point, I still had high hopes for the spaghetti. How could a spaghetti factory screw up spaghetti?! I don't even  know, but they did. There was only a small amount of sauce (which was super bland), and a tiny amount of meat. Luckily, I had saved some of the marinara sauce from the pepperoni-less cheese bread and poured it over the spaghetti which made it better. After we finished our meals, Adam asked for the checks since we had the pub crawl to go to. The waiter said he would go get them. I told Adam that our meal was suppose to come with ice-cream, so when the guy came back with our checks we asked him for the ice-cream. He was shocked and surprised that we wanted ice-cream... Now in his defense, we did ask for the checks. However, it was a really odd reaction and I doubt (even if we didn't ask for checks) that we would have been given the ice-cream if we didn't ask for it.",

  "text": "BEWARE SMALL PORTIONS!!!\n\nWe decided to visit the place as I got a taste of the Beef soup and beef pancake wrap and both were delicious. First, the seating was quick, even though the restaurant was fairly full. It was Me, wife and 5 kids. We tried a variety of items as Kids love to try new items. Wife and I have visited Taiwan many times And we love the street food there. We had : onion pancake, oyster omelette, beef wrapped pancake, crispy pork roll, sweet sausage fried rice, house chow fun, salt pepper pork, braised beef noodle soup, sweet orange pork ribs, basil century egg and Taiwanese style Clams. Total Bill was $120.00 before tip. The food was really good. The Orange Ribs were as sweet as candy. All 5 kids commented too sweet. The Century eggs were very salty, but good flavor. We would eat every dish, other than the orange ribs again. \n\nSo why the 2 Star? Portion size. I was amazed at how little was given for the price. $13 for tiny ribs that barely gave each member of our family 2 tidbits. Thats about $3 for the length of my finger. The oyster omelet had 4 oysters in it. That's like $2 per oyster. We had to cut them in half. Not one dish was over 1/2 full. The clams were delicious, but again not even 1/3 of the bowl full. We left after spending $120 and kids were still hungry.  \n\nSo if portion is not an issue, eat here. Over priced, small portions, but delicious.",

  "text": "This place is right down the road from our house so I was pretty excited to come by here on a Friday night a couple weeks ago.  The ice cream was good, and they even have pup cups (small vanilla soft serve with a mini milkbone) for a buck, which we ordered for our dog - naturally, he recommends it.\n\nWith that being said, unfortunately the two high schools students working the stand that night provided less than stellar service.  They close at 10 p.m., and we arrived around 9:45, which in my calculations means they're still open.  The students were cleaning frantically, apparently trying to get out of there quickly, which I understand as I was not looking to spend an eternity there myself.  We stood at the window for a few minutes before the girl working that night, who had looked at us several times already, opened the window and said \"yes?\"...we advised her we wanted to place an order. She told us she'd be right with us, shut the window and went back to cleaning.  Eventually, the boy working with her opened the other order-taking window and presented himself behind the cash register which I interpreted as a sign to place our order - interpretation necessary since he did not acknowledge me otherwise with either eye contact nor speech.  I quickly placed the order and we received our items quickly as well.  The girl asked my husband if he wanted whipped cream on his milkshake and he said \"no, thanks,\" to which she responded \"well, do you want whipped cream or not?.\"  I'm not making this up.  Once we received our order we bade the young lady a good night, which she did not reciprocate as she quickly shut the window.  We pulled out of the parking lot at 9:57 p.m. for those of you keeping track at home.\n\nWe did enjoy the ice cream, though my waffle bowl did have a flavor of essence of Fabuloso, the cleaning product of choice that evening.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning due solely to the service we received.",

I live down the street n around the corner, like a 5 minute walk, from the place. When I realized the delicious  smokey smells that were occasionally wafting my way were coming from their pit...well I had to try! \nI wanted brisket, but, not a menu item mid week. Disapointing! Keeping things light, and wanting to taste the meat, I ordered salad. With chicken. Mustave been a bad day for salad reason for 2 stars. In a salad, the lettuce quality is rather important. What I got was alotta trashy white stuff that u throw out disguised by a thin layer of dark green cilantro to cover. Not cool! Shudda been honest about that when I ordered. Fancy sauces, when the cost of a simple lunch is 15$!... ALL shud b PERFECT! Not just the meat n sauce! So a year later, this is what sticks in my mind... lousey, high dollar salad. Then there's that obnoxiously loud hip-hop u r subject to while waiting for a table and ur order. I don't think the boss was in. There were only a few young employees that I cud see. They were VERY friendly. We did talk b4 I left about these issues and they did try to make amends with an extra taco and they offered me free delivery on a future order but I never took em up on that. Thinking about giving another try but I'm out of wrk now, the hubby is now retired, and it is so costly! Maybe they got a happy hour? Wishful thinking probably. I'll keep u posted...",

We ordered at 10:11 pm and spent the next 90 minutes constantly refreshing the \"track order\" page to see when our cookies would arrive. We live in town less than a mile away from the store. At 11:41 (in that amount of time, I could have mixed and baked two full batches of cookies, by the way), we finally decide to call and see where our cookies are. A less than friendly representative on the phone tells me our location is closed for deliveries \"to catch up on orders.\" Says we can go to the store to pick up our order ourselves if we want. Are you kidding me?! First off, we should have never been allowed to order cookies for delivery if the store wasn't delivering. Second of all, false advertising. You say you deliver until 3am?! Thirdly, no one from the store could bother to call us and let us know what was going on? Fourthly, I understand that the person we talked to on the phone had no control over the situation, but there was no apology or compassion, and we got major attitude when we asked for a refund. This is a company that doesn't care about customer service. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a business in West Chester, and I have lived in the borough for 9 years.

I looked at the menu and I first decided I wanted a BLT and then I decided no, because I didn't want any bread.  So then I decided on turkey bacon and grits.  The wait wasn't long and I should have checked my food before I left.  I ordered a platter and it was $8.64.  I couldn't believe how high that was, just for three slices of turkey bacon and grits.  Lo and behold they had put cheese on the grits and I do not like cheese on grits and so I went back.  I told them I only wanted butter on my grits and the turkey bacon. I asked for butter on the side and they put the butter on the grits.  I decided they cannot follow instructions and then I left with my updated order.  The food was okay, but I will definitely not be back.  $8.64 for bacon, grits and a juice is outrageous!!!! NO WAY!!!! NO MORE!!!!!!!",

  "text": "One day in NOLA and my daughter wanted Crawfish so I looked to my Yelp friends for advice and discovered that J's is the place to come.  We stopped by the counter (around 11 am) and the cashier told us that the crawfish wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes so my husband ordered catfish filets.  We turned around to walk on to see if we could find any other places with crawfish and my daughter found a place in the center of the market with crawfish.  We walked over there (not realizing it was an extension of J's Seafood dock) and asked for crawfish.  The guy muttered something and pointed to the other guy at the stand.  We walked over to him and to wait a couple of minutes to get his attention, only to be told that we had to go back to the original counter that we ordered the catfish from and then screamed at her that the crawfish was ready and \"don't be chasing customers away\".  (The whole back and forth is VERY confusing!!).  We waited in line AGAIN, paid for the crawfish and then had to walk back over to the counter in the center to pick them up.  My daughter and I were about 1/2 way finished eating 2 pounds of crawfish by the time my husband's catfish was finally finished.  Overall....  the entire experience was very confusing and the customer service was really bad.",

Here is a summary of my experience:\n\n-Took a very long time to receive my food, despite the restaurant not being overly busy and had more than enough staff\n-The quality of the ramen was unremarkable at best from the overly salty broth to the noodles; I'd recommend Nomiya and Kin's ramen any day over this \n-Had a surplus of staff in the kitchen and front of house, but only a few really looked like they were trained and know what they were doing\n-The restaurant was completely dysfunctional; multiple parties walked out because they waited too long to receive food, drinks, etc \n-Did not seem to be a visible manager taking charge of the operation\n-My take out orders took way too long and I unfortunately had to cancel after 45 min\n\nHopefully this was all due to opening day jitters but from my observations, they rushed into opening prematurely without proper preparation, training and leadership.",

We had a corner room on the 4th floor next to Lafayette Park and the streetcar. You can hear the streetcar pass by but it wasn't a problem for us. There were stains on a white pillow case so I didn't use it although it was clean. The hotel is in a great location! Not to far from French Quarter or Garden District.\n  On day two of our stay, the big slow elevator broke down. All guests including housekeeping were forced to use the smaller elevator. Housekeeping was complaining about the elevator because it breaks often...so beware.\n  Shantal was suppose to make reservations for Whitney Plantation Tour but never confirmed our reservations. To make matters worse no one at the desk knew whether or not we had a reservation and had to give her call on her day off. She told them a tour driver would pick us up at 10:15 am. On the day of our tour, Shantal then told us the driver was picking us up at noon. Shantal told us the tour would last 4 hours and return us at the hotel around 5 pm. When we got on the tour bus, the driver told the group it was 6.5 hours tour by then we were on the highway so it was too late to do anything. Definitely make your own tour reservation DO NOT rely on Shantal.",

  "text": "If all you're looking for is a place to shoot guns down a range then this will suffice.  I've been here multiple times and had mixed experiences.  My last experience here will be just that.  My last.  \n\nEverything is overpriced.  I would bet that any item you find at this place, you can find cheaper online or at another store.  I get it that most of the time smaller shops need to charge more to stay in business.  This is why I do believe in supporting local shops ( I do the same with fishing bait & tackle stores). \n\nTheir customer service is hit or miss.  I've gone in there at times and not once been greeted or asked if I was looking for something.  I have been at the gun counter and just stood there looking at the guns.  There was some kid standing behind the counter that literally just stood there.  If you're going to hire someone to work the front and deal with customers they should be able to, at the minimum, talk.  Other times I've been greeted with a smile upon entrance and asked if I needed assistance.  I've been helped successfully in finding specific items.  Like I said, hit or miss.  \n\nI had a set of handgun sights put on here that was very quick.  Called and he said to come in.  Took him 5 minutes to put them on.  Was charged $30+tax for this.  I figured this was fine.  I could have bought a sight remover and done it myself, but like I said I do believe in supporting local businesses. \n\nThe last time I was here I had an inexpensive rifle that wasn't working properly. I called and spoke to the gunsmith and told him I only paid $100 for the gun and if the cost to repair it was anywhere close to this I wouldn't even bother with attempting to fix it.  He said to come in and he'll have a look and call me(he never called).  I brought it in and gave them a call 2 days later.  He said it couldn't be fixed and that he couldn't find a replacement part.  I thought OK, he'll probably charge a small fee for diagnosing it.  I go there and he hands me a bill for $35+tax that says \"not able to fix, no replacement available\".    So I ended up paying close to $40 to have them hold my gun for 2 days haha.  I get that he took time to see it wasn't able to be fixed, but there is a time and a place to do the right thing.  That is why I initially called and told him I only paid $100 for the gun. I just paid them 40% of what I paid for the thing to tell me that it's broken and can't be fixed.  Thanks!  I'm not a gunsmith but I took the gun apart multiple times trying to figure out the problem before bringing it in.  It takes 2 minutes, tops !  It's literally held together by one bolt screw.  He told me he worked on it for 1.5 hours.  \n\nMaybe i'm wrong and I guess this business is pretty cutthroat, but I know I won't be returning here.  Nickel and dime'ing me out of $40 just lost them a repeat customer.  A little decency goes a long way.  I'll gladly drive the extra miles to go to Shooters World.  I've been there multiple times and never had a bad experience.  Their range is better.  They also have a nice lounge area with free beverages.",

I've seen them hit and kick each other, cussing coming from the back (I have no idea what goes on back there!) I've been yelled at by the cashier, called in and been greeted terribly on the phone. Now that's just the service. The actual pizzas are the kicker, the dough is usually not proofed (which basically means it hasn't puffed up from the yeast and that jazz) the employees just grab hand fulls of stuff and throw them on the pizza all in the middle! I use to work at a papa Murphy's and they're supposed to measure out the ingredients. That's what you pay for!! Overall this place is terrible I have met the owner once or twice she's nice and the other older lady is too but the younger staff is completely unprofessional, unsanitary, unsafe, and need to watch their mouths around customers.

Or as in my case, will reschedule because she out of the office, get a confirmation about the appointment and get a call the next day asking to reschedule again because she scheduled a surgery instead. How much time am I going to have to take off work to be seen? I find that quite inconsiderate. If you have an appointment at 8:30 am, considerate it 9:30. Trying to get a prescription renewed? Good luck. Having this office coordinate with my pharmacy took weeks. No hormones for over 14 days- you bet I was all over the place. Or the new billing system a few months ago- 6 months with no notification about new billing changes and get slapped with $600 before I can be seen again since it had been so long. I never felt 100% with the answers I got from Ms. Ashley, as I tried my best to ask the questions in a way she could understand. Shouldn't it bet the other way around? She was always in a rush and 'had patients waiting'. I decided not to continue going to this office since I have had so many issues, but needed the last test results I had taken. I requested these results THREE times and still no answers today. No return calls, zero reliability, and a faulty office system. Ladies, get a different OBGYN.",

  "text": "Dr. Santa is a decent doctor, but Dr. Stanko may be one of the worst doctors I've ever seen. Period. \nI went in for a skin condition and she looked at my hand for about 2 seconds and said, 'oh, it's eczema.' I never had anything of the sort and i was hoping for more information. She said that she would give me a cream and that's it. There has been no improvement in 9 months. \nDuring that same appointment, she recommended dysport because they were offering a special. I usually get Botox and Dr. Stanko said that there's no difference between the two, but there is a difference that I'm now aware of. I did get the dysport and once she was done, she said, 'you didn't get enough units of dysport to qualify for the special.' Then why offer it to me? I was paying $17/unit for Botox and once I realized how wildly overpriced that was, I went elsewhere and I now pay $9.50/unit. They also never mentioned the manufacturer's discount program. \nWhen I went back recently to have my eczema re-evaluated, as soon as I walked in, I caught a big whiff of disgusting food and coffee. The woman at the front desk was eating something that made me want to gag. I had to hold my hand over my face to speak to her. No one should ever eat at any front desk ANYWHERE. It's unprofessional and disgusting. The woman I spoke to was super rude to me. She had red short hair. She told me that I had missed appointment fees to pay. I rescheduled one appointment and the other was a legit miss. It was my first. She wanted me to pay $150+, which wasn't happening. I tried explaining what happened and she kept interrupting me and was rude and indignant. Between her disgusting plate of food and attitude, I just walked out and called UPenn - which is where everyone should go. I didn't feel like I should have to argue or be spoken over.\nI don't know why these folks treat people like they are better than everyone and have no time. I wish I went to UPenn on day one because I likely wouldn't still have the problems that I do. \nI called again to see if they would print or transfer my files and they wanted to charge me another $25 or $50. I asked to speak to the manager, who they wouldn't identify by name. The manager called me and I wasn't able to pick up and she couldn't leave a VM bc i turned it off. I tried reaching her again to no avail. \nI called again today to see if they would refill the steroid cream that they gave me for the eczema while i wait for my appointment at UPenn and they refused unless I made an appointment and came in. When I needed it refilled before all of this, I called and they gave it to me with no problem. I had it later that day. Now it just seems petty and spiteful + they want to bill my insurance for nonsense.\nI find these folks to be rude, uppity, unprofessional, and extremely overpriced. I'd be willing to deal with all of that if they were actually providing wonderful care - but they don't and they couldn't care less. \nUPenn's care is unrivaled and they treat people with dignity and kindness.  Stay away from this place. They will rip you off.\n\nUpdate***\n\nI went to UPenn Derm and the doctors instantly realized that Dr. Stanko committed malpractice and misdiagnosed my skin problem. UPenn gave me the correct medicine and my hand healed in 10 days. UPenn told me not to worry about transferring my files over because they don't believe in the integrity of their work anyway.",

Both my wife and got sick, vomiting and had to make frequent trips to the restroom with diarrhea. I contacted the location the following day to let the manager know. He told me that he would submit my complaint up the chain and I would soon be contacted regarding the incident. I have yet to be called back. I'm highly disappointed and will not eat their again.",

  "text": "My family took Grandma here for her birthday dinner yesterday in hopes of satisfying cravings for both sushi and pizza. The last time I had eaten here, the sushi portion was owned by Superb Sushi; apparently, it isn't anymore. I was very unimpressed by the sushi. My roll was loose and didn't pop like sushi at the actual remaining Superb Sushi on 8th street. My husband, daughter and MIL all ordered rolls as well, but for some reason they threw everything on one plate. When my MIL got up to ask for some plates, she was given a dirty look... Not cool. Then, the kids and my husband each ordered a slice of pizza and they all got burnt on the bottom which obviously led to a bitter and unpleasant burnt taste. To top it all off, the beer wasn't even very cold at all. Sad to say, but I will not be back.",

  "text": "We visited this establishment for the first time on a Sunday evening... I never complain about anywhere that we visit even if it is a negative experience. But this situation really had me upset! We were in the area to see a movie at the theater and we only had approximately 40 minutes to grab a quick bite. We sat down at the bar and asked the bartender if we could order right away so that we could be on time for our movie. She said, \"sure no problem.\" However it took us over 40 minutes to receive our food (quesadillas and egg rolls). The bartender was too busy doing shots with the DJ and sitting in the back kitchen area on her phone for at least 30 minutes of the time that we were there! She left the bar patrons for over 15 minutes at a time to sit in the back and play on her phone! We finally asked \"can you please tell us why our food is taking so long? Our movie starts in 2 minutes\" and she very carelessly walked away and responded, \"I'll check on it.\" It still took another 10 minutes for our food to come out (all the while she was nowhere to be found). Needless to say we were late for our movie and extremely upset because there are several other places that we could have chose to grab a bite to eat and had plenty of time to do so. I think this establishment really needs to do a better job at screening who they hire and training their employees to properly care for their customers rather than drink and play on the job! Food was actually pretty good but service ... HORRIBLE!",

  "text": "I had a terrible experience here. It was my first time leasing a car and my fears about shady dealerships came true at Martin Main Line. The main problems I encountered here:\n\n1. The agreed upon price of the car I leased was increased by $150 between the negotiation and getting to the finance office. No one told me. I noticed when I got home and re-read the lease and immediately emailed the salesperson, Mitch, who replied \"I don't know what happened. I'll ask my manager\". I never heard back from him despite sending a follow up email the next week.  I guess I'm naive for assuming the agreed upon price would be the price listed in the paperwork. I didn't notice the price increase in the finance office because I was rushed through signing everything on an iPad, where the manager knocked on the door about 5 times telling the finance guy to hurry up. He did not greet us once. \n\n2. I initially purchased Honda Care, then decided I didn't want it. I called the dealership twice, left two voice messages with two finance people, and sent two emails to salespeople I had worked with prior about how to go about cancelling it/how the refund would work. No one answered at all. I ended up cancelling through the Honda Care headquarters phone number.\n\nThese are just a few of the issues I encountered but I think they demonstrate the complete lack of customer service and professionalism this dealership displays. They do not care about the customer at all once you walk out the door and they have your money. I would never go to them again and would never recommend them to friends or family. Stay away from Martin Main Line.",

I noticed as we were seated that the table didn't offer a salt or pepper shaker- which set my expeditions very high- for the chef to produce a tasteful and well balanced dish. Highly disappointed was an understatment. In hindsight I remember our server saying that LaScala was known for their pappardelle as being one of their best dishes. After taking 2 bites my immediate response was \"WHY tf?\" If the pasta was home made and fresh it was hard to tell since it was drenched in THE MOST TASTELESS, SALTLESS, under seasoned wine sauce EVER. Our server knew I was displeased yet didn't send over the manager...he just wanted to get by, I suppose. So in the end, I asked for a manger. Needless to say I was disappointed yet again. We live quite a distance from Center City, so each visit makes an impact. Maybe LaScala's chef was having a rough night, maybe our server was having a bad day, maybe the manager on duty didn't give two F's and over all it was our bad luck that we happened to try  LaScala on this particular evening...LaScala wont get a second chance with us.

Three of us ordered the ribs which had good flavor but were tough and not meaty. This was my second try of the ribs at this location and both experiences was similar.  At the 96th street location the ribs have always been very good and have almost fallen off the bone.  \n\nWe really like the set up of the bar and outdoor seating is great. The patio is now open with live music which makes this location even better. \n\ni really want this location to make it - it's a great facility on the lake, but with the poor experience that I have had on both occasions, I'm not looking to rush back for the food.",

  "text": "The positive: overall polish job is fine. She took time to clean up my nail bed where the gel polish had spilled over and cured there. \n\nThe negative: way too busy and crowded to be a relaxing experience. No magazines or anything while you're waiting or getting pedicure. The water for my pedicure was barely warm even after I asked her to heat it up once. The nail technician's nails were dirty underneath as were those of the tech working next to her. I understand that they keep their hands in water and cleaning up nail polish all day and this might have partly been polish residue as they often use their nails to clean up spillage into nail beds but it really turned me off. They didn't turn on my massage chair during the pedicure. I didn't see prices posted anywhere in the shop (they may have been and I just didn't notice). A gel manicure and regular pedicure cost $52 The polish selection was ok but I've seen better. I picked out a gel nail polish for my manicure from samples while I was getting a pedicure. She had that polish with the same number sitting on the table when she started my manicure. I went to wash my hands and she had pulled out another color. I was pretty itchy from the lotion that they used. I noticed a couple hours after the manicure that there is a painful split under my fingernail. Whether or not this is from their technique I obviously can't say for certain. For how busy they are, the parking lot is not adequate and I had to find street parking around the corner in the neighborhood.",

They never came back to say whether or not they could accommodate us. Our group left and I can assure you, I will never go back to this location. I will say we love the Mount Juliet location.

  "text": "How can a room smell bad?  Let me count the ways . . \n\nI booked one night here, a 'bayview' room.   On the few plus sides the room was bright, clean and cheerful. \n\nWhen we checked in the lady gave us a flyer that stated the water would be off in the hotel for four hours the following day.  She said they had sewer issues and then caught herself and said \"I mean we are doing plumbing work\". \n\nThere were three disgusting odors:\n1. After we showered we started noticing a sewage stench and realized it had started coming from the drains.  I had to plug the wet bar sink with a bag and shut and block the bathroom door to make the room livable.\n2.  Our room was on the bay side, and a collection of rotting seaweed caused the front door area to be totally sickening.  We tried to air out the sewer smell by opening the door but it just let in another stench.\n3. when we opened the harbor side door to get rid of the first two smells, cigarette smell started coming in.  Not as gross as the first two but still overpowering. \n\nThe next day at checkout there was an unpleasant older lady that became testy not at the problems I reported but gave me the third degree to discover who had let the cat out of the bag about the sewage when I checked in.  She said it was probably the stinking seaweed because there was no sewage issue, they were just fixing \"a broken water pipe\".   She said \"maybe the manager will call me\" about the problems and of course no one did.   The plumbers were there in force as I left, perhaps to fix the sewer smell that the hotel staff was denying.  \n\nI think it's pretty old.  There were few outlets and not all of them worked.  It was a challenge to get two phones and a laptop charged.  Also, the breakfast was the most sparse I have ever seen at a best western and they didn't even have coffee, the coffee maker was broken or something.  And, when I was in the room the chair cushion slid forward and I was horrified by the yellow stains it was hiding.  I don't know what they were but I know it looked bad. \n\n The view is beautiful, but it's kind of misleading  because there are no windows on that side you have to go outside the room in the hall to see it, where the seaweed stench will soon make you sick.   The room wasn't cheap, we got a beautiful place with no problems, very comfortable and clean with an actual ocean view you could see from the inside for the same price the next night.  \n\n Maybe the City of Dunedin should send the health inspector over.",

Had a contract  that had no written start date . Just a verbal one . I was giving my daughter $400  for a birthday gift so she could work out as a couple work out with her boyfriend. My daughter got hurt over the weekend and was taken to the emergency room. The doctor said you're not to work out for a week and had a note. My daughter and her boyfriend call Jeremy and told him what was going on and asked to start the next Monday and he said absolutely not .He said  my daughter  is excused but the boyfriend is not. They explain to Jeremy  they joining as a couple and Wanted to start together at the same time.he said absolutely not boyfriend has to come today you can start in a week. My daughter called me very upset saying  what was going on,she knew I had been to a lot of trainers and I thought that I could call him and explain .So I call Jeremy thinking I could get him to give them a week because of the injury and he was very condescending rude try to belittle me because I was a woman told my daughter boyfriend who is the man who is the boss you gonna let two women tell you what to do that your daughter's mother called who is the man of the house. Ladies if you have 1 ounce of dignity use a reputable trainer. I'm not saying that he's not a good trainer he just does not have any People skills. This could all been avoided if he were just of been kind enough to let them start a week later to take care of an injury. After all they were joining as a couple not working out separately.After going round and round trying to explain to him  , he saying he's not giving the money back and I said  so it's all about the money and he said no I said well I have no other choice than to write a review about what happened and then he screams this that I'm threatening him and he hung up on me.Very professional. I've had lots of trainers had never had one ever act like he has .",

  "text": "This place HAS gone downhill since Raley's bought it, and I HAVE been there before they bought it.  Used to shop there regularly for meats and produce.  I haven't been there since February when my dog died.  I heard Raley's had bought it and it had gone downhill, so I thought I would stop in and see what had happened.\n\nThe first thing I noticed setting foot and cane inside the door was a \"security guard\" looming over the entrance.  I never noticed any security guards before.  I think the menacing presence of a guy with a gun (actually not sure if he had a gun but the menacing attitude was enough to imply he would have liked a gun at the very least) had a LOT to do with why the store was so empty - something I have NEVER seen on a weekday afternoon before.\n\nThe second thing was when I approached the handicapped carts.  The \"security guard\" approached and informed me I would need a key.  He did not volunteer anything else.  So I had to ASK - \"And where would I GET a key?\"  He told me I would have to hand over my ID to get a key for the handicapped cart.\n\nI don't remember having to ask for a key before, but if I ever did, I know for a fact they did not make me hand over my ID.  There is NO FREAKING WAY I am handing ID over to a stranger.  Talk about asking to have your identity stolen!  NO STORE I have ever shopped at INCLUDING RALEY'S has ever asked for ANYTHING before I can use one of the handicapped carts, let alone my driver's license.\n\nSo I turned around and walked out.  I WILL NOT shop at a store that treats its customers like criminals.  Raley's can get stuffed.  I won't be shopping at either store from now on.  I used to shop at Raley's on a semi-regular basis, but no more.  I have no idea what their plans are for the only Sak'n Save that seems to be left in town - seems they closed the other one(s) .  Rumors say they are going to turn it into a Food Source.   Food Source sucks anyway and I NEVER shop there, so if they're turning it into a Food Source, it was going to be a goner anyway.  Yim's Asian Market, Trader Joe's, Grocery Outlet, Winco and Costco will be seeing a whole lot more of me from now on.  I've even found an alternate place to get minced lemongrass, which was one of the things I used to regularly go to Raley's to get.  \n\nGiven they've decided to treat people like they are thugs and crooks at their \"low rent\" locations, I don't need to go there even for that anymore, which means no more OTHER Raley's purchases either.",

  "text": "We went out of our way to try Chopstick House because of the good Yelp reviews. Orange chicken combo: the chicken tasted like it had been cooked 2-3 days ago. The orange sauce and seasonings tasted ok, but the chicken was inedible. We knew it was a risk to try an unknown place for Chinese food - but \"other people\" wrote good reviews.  I just want to know where these \"other people\" have been eating! Bless your hearts. I've never had Chinese food where I couldn't even count on the fried rice and egg drop soup to fall back on. Across the board at most every Chinese place I've visited - never had those things \"messed up\" quite so bad. The egg drop soup tasted like pure vegetable oil, and had some fako yellow coloring that looked disgusting. The fried rice was also not edible. Not much flavor at all, veggies not cooked - crunchy like they were raw - and totally the wrong 'consistency' for fried rice. We asked for extra 'crispy noodles' for our soup - they wanted 60 cents for a small bag of them! We didn't discover how bad the food was until we had driven 45 minutes to get home. When we called to give constructive feedback, the manager said she would consider a partial refund IF AND ONLY IF we drove the nasty food 45 minutes back to the restaurant. I really think the 5 star reviews are paid or written by employees or family members. This place is horrible!",

But it's bad business when customer service falls flat on it's face after a major misstep.\n\nI went to the Redwood Rotisserie with a friend for lunch today. Both of us had burgers which to start with were pretty mediocre along with the small amount of fries that came with them. But that wasn't the real issue here.\n\nAs my friend started to eat his burger he got that weird look on his face...like, \"waiter, there's a fly in my soup\" look. Reaching in his mouth he pulled out a piece of parchment paper, packaging from either the beef patty or from the cheese slice. As he dissected the burger he found the entire piece of paper (when I worked in the meat industry we used this paper to separate fresh beef patties; the same can be found between slices of pre-cut cheese). \n\nWe called the waitress over and showed her the problem. She was immediately apologetic and offered to have a new burger cooked. My friend declined. She said that, of course, we would not be charged for the meal. All was correctly handled up to this point.\n\nThe kicker was, when the bill came, we were charged for his soft drink. Had it been me I would have certainly comped his soft drink and MAYBE comped my meal too...but no, he was charged $2.49 for his soft drink. Needless to say neither of us will be returning.\n\nThis was my second time at this Redwood Rotisserie. My first visit would have gotten 3 1/2 stars (if i could have done that), But this visit barely makes 2 stars. Food is okay, decor is very nice (hats off to the designer), customer service pretty flat.",

My girlfriend at the time drove me to Kennedy. I sat in the ER for about 3 hours to the point where it eventually stopped on its own. I was about to leave when they called me back. The young 20-something-year-old doctor cauterized the inside of my nose even though the bleeding had stopped. Then he shoved a cylindrical object up inside my nostril and in a split second, overinflated the device. I let out a scream as the bones around my nasal cavity and eye socket cracked and my eye was pushed out of the socket and off to the side.\n\nIt was left like that for several days until I could get an appointment with a specialist in Cherry Hill to have it removed. He was shocked at how bad a job the doctor did. To this day, I have a twisted heap of scar tissue all throughout the inside of my right nostril that blocks the passage. Anytime the topic of Kennedy hospital comes up in conversation, I hear horror story after horror story from anyone who's ever been there. Unless it's a matter of life or death, I cannot overstate the importance of selecting any other hospital over this one.",

We were wrong. He didn't even want to take the order... He literally stared at us, took a doop breath, and reluctantly wrote what we wanted. We should have left but we didn't-bad judgement. We paid and waited...half our order was wrong. Then we got it correct but it was half done. The chicken fingers were not done in the middle and the cheeseteak had hardly any meat-& i paid for extra meat. We asked to use the restroom to wash our hands and we were told there was no restroom available. Then a younger Caucasian woman walks in, asks to use the restroom without buying anything, and is immediately taken to the restroom. We left at that point. It's sad because it is a great location but disappointing because the last thing you expect coming into that establishment is racism....",

  "text": "This has to be the WORST McDonald's I have ever been to.  The lines are always so long (not because they are busy, but because they are that slow), and they NEVER get the orders right.  I have been there a few times over the past few weeks due to being on the run from the holidays - I received a McChicken sandwich, with my special order \"PLAIN\" sticker on it, that had mayonnaise and lettuce on it - didn't check until I got home, and my 6 year old son wouldn't eat it, so into the trash it went.  On December 26th, I went INTO the restaurant and ordered 2 happy meals, one with a \"Cheeseburger - NO pickles, NO onions\" (it was rung up correctly), one with a 4 piece nuggets, and then an additional McChicken plain.  After 13 minutes, I was given one happy meal, and another bag that had a burger, and a chicken sandwich in it, with a toy.  When I tried to tell the gentleman who handed it to me that I was supposed to have two happy meals and an extra sandwich, he literally said to me \"um no.\"  Mind you, I had the receipt, which I showed to him, and he huffed and walked back to get the items I was missing.  Of course, when I got home after spending almost 20 minutes in the restaurant, the plain cheeseburger I ordered had both onions and pickles on it....my 3 year old wouldn't eat it, so that went into the trash as well.  Do yourself a favor and just stay home and throw your money into the trash can there, it will save you time and trouble.",

  "text": "I made a Yelp just to write a review about this awful establishment. I went with 4 of my friends and only 1 of us was pleased with our meal. For appetizers, we ordered the ginger salad, miso soup, baby udon noodles, shrimp shumai, and gyoza. The shumai and noodles were decent. The ginger salad had a watered down dressing, and tasted as though the lettuce was dirty. The gyoza was soggy and just overall bad. For our entrees, we ordered a spicy tuna roll, a rainbow roll, chicken yakitori, and 2 salmon avocado rolls. This was the worst sushi I've ever had. My salmon avocado roll tasted like bubblegum. The spicy tuna roll didn't even remotely taste like tuna; we honestly thought it was something else. The rainbow roll wasn't very fresh. The service was decent- we ordered two salmon avocado rolls and at first only one came. It took forever to get a side order of white rice. To conclude- don't waste your time nor money here. There are plenty of other sushi restaurants nearby that are a million times better.",

  "text": "Don't waste your time here. We went in because this place has good reviews, however I would beg to differ. The beer and appetizer was the best part of the meal. The waitress bragged about how the pizza is fast fired in 90 seconds, however it simply wasn't cooked. When we notified the waitress she said that Neapolitan pizza is doughier, and it is simply a preference if we don't like it so undercooked. I looked it up and Neapolitan pizza is defined by the sourdough used, and tomatoes grown on mount Vesuvius and cheese from a water buffalo. Nowhere is it noted that Neapolitan pizza is not fully cooked and served with raw dough. Although featuring a softer and molten centre, our pizza crust was doughy and raw. Also we ordered the pistachio pesto pasta and although there were some good flavours in there it was served cold. We mentioned this also, and since the chefs are on display and our table was near the cooking area, we had to overhear the waitress telling the cooks about our complaint.  The best part of the meal was the appetizer, which was a cauliflower artichoke dip. It was great, but the entrees were terrible. Maybe the waitress should have gotten the manager because she couldn't handle our complaints and we actually paid for this terrible food. I asked her if she had ever been to \"blaze pizza\" which also does a fast fire pizza and she had not. Well I won't be going back to Famoso again that's for sure. It was uncomfortable in the small environment as we waited forever for our bill to arrive. We noted that the pasta was advertised as imported from Naples, however it was served so quickly. We saw the chefs scooping out pre cooked past and reheating it in the oven. At the price point I expect made to order food. This was fast food. Why import your pasta if you are simply going to reheat it? Then serve us raw pizza? Disappointing. The bill wasn't worth me getting to write this scathing review.",

  "text": "Boy. This restaurant has so much potential yet falls incredibly short. We went for a Sunday lunch where it was not crowded by any means. Somehow we still waited over 30 minutes to get a glass of wine and over an hour to even get an appetizer. We had to repeatedly ask for bread because quite frankly we were starving. By the time our food came (1.5 hours in) 2 meals were cold and had clearly just sat around for quite some time. I had the pan seared scallops. While this meal could have been incredible, it was probably the most lackluster scallops I've ever had. Not only was it cold, the scallops themselves were very tough, the \"goat cheese\" grits had no flavor and the asparagus overpowered every flavor on the plate. Another member of our party got the fried clams, and it was 100% breading. There MIGHT have been one piece that actually had clams in it, but frankly for $20 you would be better off getting chicken nuggets at jack n the box and saving your money. In another meal, the seafood just didn't taste all that fresh and the one seafood averse member of our party who ordered steak could have easily grilled up the steak at home. I am only giving this 2 stars, because the manager did try to make up for the poor experience, but it will take quite a lot for them to convince us that this restaurant is worth visiting when there are so many other great options in Santa Barbara.",

  "text": "Had dinner there last Saturday night with my husband and another couple.  We had a reservation at 8pm, arrived at 8:05 and had to wait for them to clear and set a table for us.  The waitress promptly opened our bottles of wine and filled our water but did not bring us menus for another 15 minutes.  We placed an appetizer order first at the waitress' suggestion and she didn't return to take our entree order until the appetizers were on the table.  She brought our entrees out and did not return to check on us until most of the table was done eating.  I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca and was given a veal dish made with marsala wine, spinach and mushrooms.  When I was finally able to ask the waitress about it, she realized she gave the Saltimbocca to someone else at my table who ate it not realizing the order was wrong.  I had only eaten about a 1/4 of the dish as I do not like marsala wine and she cleared it away and never offered to bring me what I ordered.  It was late at this point and the kitchen was closing.  One person at our table ordered dessert which was quickly brought out and she dropped the bill, explaining that she gave us the dessert for free since she messed up the entree.  We paid  the bill and sat for another 10 minutes when she came back to the table and reminded us she gave us the dessert for free and then said she forgot to charge us for the appetizers and gave us another bill.  Not sure if I'll return based on how our table was treated.  The appetizers that I ate were decent but I left hungry and annoyed.",

The food took a very long time to come and part of our order WAS MISSING!

I was in a hurry and hungry and it is Thursday Sushi so I figured I might as well give Ricks a shot and boy was I disappointed!!!\n\n1st, place was empty....granted it was 2 in the afternoon. \n\n2nd, place was a mess, sticky menus and dirty bussed bins in plan view.\n\n3rd, language barrier, I was trying to ask questions and no one understood me.\n\nOk, I could go on but let me get to my dinner.  I love my normal Mickey Nigiris and Upside down Shrimp it's basically the only thing I eat and it looked fabulous in its little to go container, and I get home all hungry and excited, get my sauce ready and my chop sticks in action to take the first bite and uggggg the tuna was so fatty I couldn't even bite through it....ok no biggie, maybe it's just that one, nope all 6 where layered with fat strands....and it had a hint on fishy smell. I was so disappointed!!! You can't tell me that the girl preparing them did not take notice??? \n\nI will not return AT ALL....and I will never, ever cheat on my favorite spot just down the street.\n\nIn all fairness, for those who might want to give it a shot, their prices where good and here is a picture of before and after and the menu....maybe you will have a better experience then",

  "text": "I just walked out of this joint due to some of the worst service I've ever received. I arrived around 5:40 on one of the first beautiful spring days in St.Louis hoping to participate in some Happy Hour and Patio action. We (a party of two) walked in ahead of a party of 3 and party of 6. The hostess then told us we'd have to wait 25-30 for a table and the larger parties got seated right away. While at the bar waiting, I finally managed to order a drink by saying \"excuse me I'd like to get a drink\" after waiting 6-8 minutes at an empty bar. We ended up only waiting 15 minutes before another table opened up outside. So it's approximately 6 o'clock by this time, we wait another 15 before we're approached by a waiter. He asks what can I get you, my boyfriend orders a beer, the waiter then takes off to get the beer without asking if we wanted to order food or anything else. He returns, sets down the beer, SAYS NOTHING, then walks away quickly. We wait till 6:40 and no one has returned to take our food order so we say forget this, leave cash on the table for drinks and walk out. Pass out waiter on the way out and he again just ignores us. So infuriating. I've had better service at Taco Bell's.......",

She then left me with color in my hair for over an hour to process while she left the salon to go get her kid from school. I thought that was strange, maybe mildly unprofessional but not something to complain over. After she took out my hair my balayage that was supposed to get rid of my brassiness and give me lowlights turned into me having solid white, almost blue hair. Again, I wanted to be polite give it some time for the toner to wash out and try and see if I could get used to the new doo. I contacted Katie today explaining that I didn't want to hurt her feelings but I would love to have my hair corrected. She couldn't figure out who I was at first, then told me I was being too rude for her to work with me any longer and finally started to insult my intelligence and apparently my life choices. I'm not even mad she ruined my hair, just shocked she was outrageously unprofessional and treated me like she was a high school mean girl. I work in customer service have dealt with some awful customers and I have NEVER treated one like she treated me.",

I was in a rush so did not have time to call the front desk, but even after housekeeping came the next day, it was not cleaned up.

We waited about 45 minutes before we got one dish from our order. It took about 15 more minutes to get the remaining 4 items. They said that 'stuff is ready at different times,' which I understand, but I'm pretty sure there would be a giant pot of grits and rice (as I write this, I realize we never got our order of dirty rice). \nThe grilled soft shell crab sandwich was basically just a grilled soft shell with no meat on a big roll. \nShrimp and grits with cheese and gravy was good, jambalaya was great, but for $4 extra for shrimp on it, I'd hope for more than 3 pieces of shrimp. Boudine 'sausage' was also good.",

I paid for my smoothie and bag of chips and a bottle of water, then proceeded to wait for my smoothie while munching on the bag of chips. I noticed the girl finished making the smoothie for the flight attendant ahead of me, then started washing the used items. I figured she was just cleaning when I realized that she had no intention of making my smoothie. She then started to clean around the cash register and restocking donuts. As I finished my bag of chips and had been waiting 5 minutes, I finally asked if my Apple Kale Smoothie was ready. The blonde girl making smoothies seemed to have heard this order for the first time and asked Marlene at the register if she had heard about this. Excuse me??\n\nShe finally made my smoothie and I assumed she was multi-tasking because she began tidying up around the register again. As soon as she came out from behind the counter and started tidying up the snack display when I snapped. The smoothie was sitting untouched in the blender. I asked whether my smoothie was ready basques my flight had started boarding. Finally, the lady manning the register finally poured it into a cup and handed it to the blonde girl to hand to me. \n\nI don't understand whose responsibilities are what but what happened is not ok. Unfortunately, a survey was not available to me on the receipt, otherwise I would have made sure the young blonde's behavior was not acceptable in any situation. \n\nIn other news, my smoothie was a little sweet but tasted fine.",

My work is 1 hour away and it's hard for me to take time off to get car serviced and a loaner would've been appreciative. Anyways, I took my car in for an oil change and the employees in the service area were extremely rude. As soon as I went to the desk to pay the first thing the girl said was to buy new tires.

  "text": "Wow. Just wow. Worst. Service. Ever. I very rarely write reviews, but I feel the need to let the public know about this place. I finally just asked for my hard drive back and let them keep the rest of the computer and my $100 deposit. The contract and rates are so obviously not in the consumer's favor and geared in their favor. You are charged to ask about anything about your computer via phone or in person. You are told to sign that you will pay anywhere from $75-$500 MINIMUM to fix your device without telling you in advance where you'll fall in this range. Pay them $75/hr and you are considered economy which means you'll be lucky to hear from them in a week. Paid $25 to jump to the front of the line and that took 2 days. Was specifically told that the diagnostic would be free and then when trying to pick up computer, said that was not the case and said that they never said that. Literally lied to my face!!! Just asked for my computer back and was told that would take all weekend bc there were tester parts and they couldn't be bothered before then to put my computer back together to give it back to me. 3 days. The whole experience is just awful and they're just rude. You are just treated like you are garbage and lucky for them to give you their awful service. It's almost as though they're taking advantage of everyone being in a bad position with their essential devices that run their everyday lives in their hands. They VERY obviously don't care at all about their customers or the consumers of this city. They're hardly ever open (10-4 if you're lucky and they don't just put a sign on the door that they're gone), don't answer the phone, or texts and charge you $10-25 for bothering them if they do! And the guy running the place looked like he was super high on drugs too. In today's consumer driven economy, this is just inexcusable to be treated that way. Stay FAR away from this place, keep your devices FAR away from this place. Do not go here! I got out with my drive and a $100 fee to be told there was nothing they can do and was just happy to get away from that place. I honestly believe the good reviews are fake and them or their friends posting or maybe for a previous owner. Learn from my experience (worst experience ever)!  Do not go anywhere near this place!!!!!  I feel like they need to be reported to the BBB or the Chamber or the Media or something. Be warned!\n\nBy the way, there is another Apple repair like a block down that's upstairs where I had gotten good service before. Looking over the reviews, it looks like this place is getting mixed up with the other one. I feel bad for the other guy bc he was great! Should have gone to him again. This is the shop on the first floor across the street from the Starbucks. Stay Away!",

Went to go see the new Mary Poppins with my family for Christmas and the entire time a kid was in the row behind me throwing up in a popcorn bucket. We had to get up and leave cause it was so disturbing. The dumbest part to me is that the only thing they did was have someone come to clean up the puke while the movie was playing. It's dumb to spend almost $60 and not even see the end of the movie. There's absolutely no reason this should of happened. They should give a private showing to everyone in the theater so some of us that got up to leave could watch the end without having to watch the whole first half again and spend another $60. Don't know if I will ever be able to go to this theater again.",

  "text": "Awful service!!! This must have been my 3rd or 4th visit...previous visits were fine, but my visit this past Thursday was by far the worst. I work in the CBD and won't be going back.  The restaurant was busy, but still had a few open tables left. \n\nWhen it was my turn to order; I felt rushed. I asked our server about the crab cakes appetizer- if it had a lot of breading. She said it has a combination of both. I'm picky about my crab cakes...and I don't like a whole lot of breading bc it's mushy. I was thinking about it; and she asked if I wanted more time to order. I said no, I'll just get the tomato remoulade with shrimp appetizer. \n\nThen I thought about it some more- I think I'll just try the crab cakes. In less than 10 mins, I was able to get the server's attention to ask her to switch it to the crab cakes. She said I think your dish is done; and she asks me, do you still want to change it? I said yes please. Then she told the manager that I wanted to change my order. Get this...the manager comes to the table and says your order is actually at the window, do you still want the crab cakes? I said yes, then he proceeds and says it will delay her order (my coworker's) bc it's on the same ticket. I proceed and calmly say could you just bring out her order, you just said it was at the window.  He walks off and pretends like he didn't want to hear what I said and tells our server to change it. \n\nWhen the bill comes out, they charged me for the crab cakes entree $17, instead of the appetizer! They surely showed me. I just paid it and didn't bother to fight this bill.  This is the last of my $20 something dollars for lunch that they will get from me!",

  "text": "Very unhappy, you lost a valued customer. We had a problem where Monro Muffler underfilled our engine by 3 quarts of oil and caused damage to the engine. Monro's insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer, we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don't change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn't tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that, was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area, only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here, and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil and do what Joe told us and the insurance company they could not do. So on top of losing a service customer, I'm on the market for a new car and can tell you for sure where I will not be getting it.",

  "text": "Randy H\nAvon, Indiana, United States\n3\nPending review\nThere's a whole lot of stupid going on here!!!\nMy experience began when I had to chase a Portillo's employee out of the handicap stall of the bathroom after waiting at least ten minutes so I could take my child who is in a wheelchair to the bathroom. I had to ask him to finish up. He didn't apologize. \n\nI then went to the desk to order a beer and had a dissatisfied customer standing in front of me who was irritated because he couldn't order a beer. It seemed the employee had some issue with the cash register and could not ring him up. The manager had to come over to the beer island and solve this cash register mystery. We waited a good 10 minutes before the manager came over to resolve the issue. I had to pay cash because it made it less painful but it got me my beer. \n\nWe ordered our food and it was 32 minutes before we had it in hand. It was 9:30pm on a Saturday night and NOT busy. Several employees tried to look busy behind the counter ( even Spanky, bathroom boy) while others played on their phones. \n\nWhile receiving our food they told us they were out of chocolate cake- the same cake for which they are supposedly famous- they were out of it! My wife asked them what they were going to do about that and got a blank stare from the employee. She was offered a milkshake that had been sitting on the counter for the 20 minutes she stood there and waited for our food. She turned down that offer and demanded chocolate cake. Somehow cake magically appeared from nowhere and we got our cake. The manager had to come to the cake rescue. When the manager had to intervene, she seemed irritated with the female holding out on the cake. \n\nWhile waiting for my wife to get our food a gentleman hovered behind me for at least two or three minutes with a mop bucket. There was a some sort of spill on the floor behind me and he didn't know what to do. Finally another employee who was wiping down tables came by and he asked her, \"so... should I like mop this up, or what?\" And she said, Yeah, I guess.\" So he did. BRILLIANT!!! I was waiting for the spill to jump into the bucket for him! \n\nLastly, the food was average at best. The cake was no better than that you can get at Target. Needeless to say, the manager is a saint for not flipping out completely on every employee in the place. She deserves a medal. This place deserves to be bulldozed and put out of its misery. Go elsewhere! Anywhere!",

Truly. I'm a regular guest in and out. I have ordered their small Chef Salad seven times for delivery in the past. 4 out of 7 times, within minutes of eating a small salad (it's huge) portion, I was doubled over with extreme lower abdominal pain, explosive diarrhea, nausea, and headache that lasted over 48 hours. \n\nThey didn't wash the veggies. It's a no-brainer after decades in the food service business and nearly 30 years as an RN. As Pinocchio's is open well past other businesses, I can't always get my go-to chef salad (when that's exactly what I want). I continued to give them the benefit of doubt and kept the salad among my orders. I didn't complain until a pattern of poor prep behavior was evident.\n\nExcept THIS time, I simply added in the instructions to wash the lettuce thoroughly and the, I called and told her why. Her tone was condescending, rude, and smartass. \"Well, why didn't you stop asking for it? I wouldn't have (unintelligible) enough to get it again.\" Excuse me?!\n\nI took to this mission that would be less like a drama queen, would be a reasonable and not a \"one time only\" issue/mistake on their part, would reenforce that important step in prep that protects the consumer, and allowed me to enjoy my choice knowing that I'll have their back as they have mine. \n\nThis horrid girl infuriated me. As she would rather see business loss, potential liability, and negative press rather than slimply relay a message, I'll simply speak to the Boss and sadly put Pinnocchios Restaurant considerably lower on my list of choice delivery in Media.",

The neck part was the worst. I go to the front desk. No manager on duty. Front desk girl calls manager and told me he would be here at 7. She said she'd comp the room after I showed her all the bites. She called security and I had to fill out a report. She put me  in 1011 in the meantime so I could shower and regroup. 7 rolls around and no manger. I go down at 8 and a new front desk person is there. He knows nothing about the issue. At 8:30 manager finally arrives but doesn't call me. I go to him. We sit in lobby. I show him pics and my neck and ear. He apologized and told me my stay would be taken care of. I asked him about all my clothes and luggage now exposed to these disgusting creatures. He told me a 3rd party would come in and evaluate it and based on that they would decide if they would replace my luggage. He did offer to dry clean all my clothes in heat. I left them out and left. 6:30 I come back and housekeeping is just now getting to my new room. I go to front desk, 2 people, neither know of my situation. Laundry finally comes. I have a $600+ bill. I checkout at 5am for an early flight. New front desk person knows nothing about my situation. My bill is now well over 1k. She said she would have the manager call me at 7. 9:30 rolls around and I call. I'm now told EVERY manager is in a meeting until noon (I'll then be on my flight). I had to go to wal-mart the night before to buy bed bug spray to spray down all my luggage and clothes. I threw out a lot, in fact. I was told by the manager this happens 2-3 times a year. This is what you can expect from this hotel? Out of respect, I was very calm and collective. I refrained from making a scene or discussing this around other guests. I had no intention of using the internet and other sources to share my story or pictures, but at this point there is no other choice. \n\n- Jacob",

  "text": "I don't usually write reviews, but we had an unusual experience that I wanted to share.  We were in Nashville with our young grandkids for the weekend, and based on the good reviews, we ordered pick-up.  The order and pick-up went smoothly and the food tasted quite good.  However, after dinner, all of us experienced extreme thirst, drinking multiple glasses of water.  The 2 year old woke up several times at night, crying for water, which never happens.  We were fine the next day.  Not sure what was in the food - msg perhaps?",

  "text": "Like most others, we came here after shopping at Bass Pro next door. I was very impressed with the layout and appearance of the restaurant. It's decorated very well and appeared to be clean. We came in on a Friday night, but it was pretty empty. Even though we saw plenty of open tables, we were still told it would be a 10 minute wait. Not a big deal.\n\nThe staff was very attentive and friendly. The menu seemed to offer a lot but the \"Endless Fried Shrimp\" sign caught my attention at the entrance so I was set on that.. This is where it all went down hill. The shrimp was butterflied and deep fried to the point where you couldn't even see or taste the shrimp at all. Every bite was like a bite of previously frozen breading. The plate came out with a pile of fries, a few shrimp on top, and cole slaw on the side. The slaw looked gross (watery and not even real cabbage) so I passed on that and the fries were mediocre - even my toddler didn't care for them. My husband had the Mahi Mahi, which he said was just OK. I tried a bite and it was bland and dry, not flavorful at all. The shrimp was the biggest disappointment though.",

  "text": "My family and I dined here tonight after my nephew's graduation. We were a party of six. It was one of the worst experiences we ever had the moment we sat down. Our waitress name aeriella(don't know how to spell name), was the worst waitress we ever had at this restaurant. She had a bad attitude and the service was horrible. We ordered the appetizers. We all thought it was pretty good. Our waitress never came over to see if we needed anything or ask how was everything or are we doing ok. She back over when it was time to order the entree. We ordered our entrees and our table was never cleared off until it was close to the time for our food to come out. Everytime we asked her any kind of questions, she gave off a bad attitude. It's not like we were rude towards her. Now to the food. None of us enjoyed our entrees; well I didn't even get an entree because I was frustrated. I ordered a ribeye and for $30, I wasn't expecting a thin and small piece of steak. I've been to steakhouses in new york and even chophouse, so I wasn't expecting for it to be that size for that price, but I was expecting it to be a little bit thicker than what I received. I told the waitress and she gave me another attitude and asked what I wanted. As I was telling her what I wanted she was walking away before I could finish the order. I ordered the garlicky shrimp pasta and the sauce came out watery and I had two whole shrimp that was sliced in half, which made it look real curly. They must have ran out of shrimp I couldn't believe the kitchen staff could send something out like that. So, I also sent that back and didn't order anything else. Our waitress sort of snatched the plate away with an attitude. I left without eating any entrees. My family didn't even finish their food. They only ate some of it because they were hungry. When they got home, they just threw their food away. They also, felt that they would've had better at cheesecake factory. When it was time to pay for the food, our waitress was never to be found. My husband had to ask another waiter to get her. The servers that brought the food out was more polite even the waiter that went to get her. I wished we had him. The food and the service was one of the worst experiences we ever had at grandlux. Even the manager didn't come over to apologize for the inconvenience or see if we needed anything. Everyone said they will never return again. This experience ruined my nephew's night. He didn't even enjoy it.",

  "text": "Last summer I hit a bad pothole and blew my tire out. The next day I drove it to Meineke to get it checked out because it was the closest place to my apartment. They said the tire was ruined and I needed a replacement. Let it be known I had 4 brand new Goodyear tires put on in February last year. Not knowing much about cars, I thought I'd leave it in the hands of professionals, but that was a BIG MISTAKE. They put on a cheap-o brand tire that had lower treads and was completely different from my other tires. Left it on the front! I just got done having another tire replaced (from hitting yet another pot hole) at the original place I got the new tires (Sam's club). They said they had to replace the odd tire because it was dangerous to leave it on... when they took it off, it was plugged in the weakest spot. I was charged over $200 for this cheap USED tire from this scam of a business! Unless you know what you're talking about when it comes to cars, do NOT come here because they will take advantage of you and rip you off!!!",

  "text": "I've been staying at the Alexander on business for the past 12 weeks. Every aspect of the stay was great, especially the staff and food at the Market Table breakfast, up until the very end. \n\nMy company covered the cost of parking in the garage for the first few nights. After which, we could either park across the street or pay out of pocket to continue parking in the garage. I elected to remain in the garage. Apparently, the monthly garage parking fees cannot be pro-rated. Meaning if you stay in the garage May 31st through July 1st you are going to be charged for 3 months, rather than the 1 month you actually stayed there. My situation was similar. My company covered the costs up until May 30th, and I parked in the garage May 31st through mid-August. So, to my surprise, as I was preparing to check out, I was slapped with a $700 ($175/month) parking bill. Despite the fact I elected to be billed monthly. I didn't even try to dispute the last 2 weeks of August that I'm being charged for. But charging a full month for 1 day in May, where is the customer service aspect in that? Especially considering my vehicle was broken into and cost me upwards of $800 to get the window repaired and replace the lost items. To add insult to injury, I was told on two separate occasions that due to my misfortune in their garage (the break in) they would take care of the parking fee for me. Which would have been an incredible act of good faith. However, I guess the staff wasn't on the same page, because I still ended up paying the whole amount.\n\nAs I said, outside of this situation, the staff and service were amazing. But I think it's incredibly distasteful to do what they did at the very end. Talk about leaving a bad taste in your mouth.",

  "text": "Oh, where do I begin...  Today, I returned an online purchase, that I received yesterday, to the Nordstrom Rack store in Willow Grove, PA. I didn't have to wait in line as the cashier waved the flag at her register as soon as I walked up with a sodden expression on her face to let me know she was available.  Wow, waived a flag - now I get it after my experience.      \n\n\nThe cashier, her name, 11843588, asked for my email address, and I told her that it's on file, she wouldn't let up and I told her that I did not give it when I was there previously and received emails. She didn't like that I wasn't obeying her authority it seemed and may have rolled her eyes.  Next, she was staring at the numbers trying to make sense of the simple receipt and the merchandise only returning two of the items and told me my refund was X.  I exclaimed that there are two more items.  She then tried to return the next item, at which point after, again, trying to make sense of the screen, tells me that the item is past 100 and some odd days return policy.  I said WHAT! I just received these items yesterday.  She doesn't know what to do now, and I am considered irate, since I raised my voice, and the manager is called. I confirmed that the manager was called, because obviously intervention was needed.  The next cashier, her name, 11779998, wearing dollar store flip flops, and, I guess, trendy frayed, purposely ripped/cut cropped jeans, t-shirt and a do-rag looking like she just cleaned toilets tells her that she will ring up the rest of my return, and gives me an attitude.  With that, the manager, Brianna (who was dressed better), comes over and tells me we don't tolerate the raising of the voice, while she and the other cashier were holding my returned merchandise hostage.  I was actually being bullied by a bunch of snowflakes (see urban dictionary) in a store for returning merchandise.  It was so difficult to keep my mouth shut just to get my refund and get the heck out of there.  You can never argue with a snowflake, it's equivalent to trying to reason with a 4 year old who wants to eat a bag of candy.  The whole experience was incredibly bizarre and out-of-line.  Did I mention that the big dummy security guard came over to try to intervene as if it were a bar room brawl. I'm thinking WHAT IS GOING ON???, AM I ON CANDID CAMERA!. I'm sure they all immediately took a break and ran back to their \"safe-room\" and had cupcakes and punch or crack.\n\n\n\nI finally got out of there with my refunds and called Nordstrom to voice my complaint.  My complaint is supposed to be emailed to the district manager, but come on, what is really going to be done - they may even get a chuckle out of it. The thought process of yesteryear used to be the customer is always right.  If you have a receipt and the corresponding merchandise, HERE IS A TIP:  NOTHING SHOULD BE SAID TO THE CUSTOMER AT ALL EXCEPT, THANK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY!!!  GOT IT!!!\n\n\n\nI thought Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack were a bit classier than Walmart.  To my surprise that is absolutely not the case these days, it is a completely Ghetto check-out experience - one that will leave you puzzled.  Not only that, the store looks like a thrift store. Too bad they cannot get anyone to work there with a higher than 75 IQ with 100 being average or is it that they just don't care.  It saddens me to see the devolution of the human race and this is just a microcosm of the big picture.  I couldn't even believe what these creatures were wearing and their demeanor. \n\n\nTo add icing on the cake, I then stopped at TJMaxx in Abington, PA, which is down the road and the worst dumpster of a TJMaxx store. You should have seen the bed clothes these cashiers were wearing, think faded black t-shirt, your oldest, tightest sweat pants, and pink locker room flip flops.  I couldn't believe my eyes!!!  Two more stores to cross off my list... unless of course, I'm in a better neighborhood.",

  "text": "I was a patient in April 2018, I spent 7 days at the hospital.  I am an RN and worked as a nurse at this hospital for 9 years.  My experience after gastric surgery was extremely poor.  I had a medication sensitivity and reduced respirations and transferred to PCU (Progressive Care Unit) and ICU.  PCU had poorly skilled nurses for the most part.  I had to get up frequently and was on O2, Several IVs, and a telemetry monitor and was told to go to the restroom by myself which was impossible.  I also had my O2 ( once back in bed) not turned back on 3 times in one night.  While in ICU a day nurse was not given info my medication sensitivity and she offered the medication (A Pump which was still on my IV Pole) to me which I strongly declined - that is why I was in ICU!!  I also had missed labs that was supposed to be drawn, Aspiration Pneumonia from the surgery, and placed on Isolation when I should not have been.  When transferred to the various units Med/Surg Gastric to PCU to ICU back to PCU, and then back to Med/Surg Gastric unit the Nursing reports that are given were very lax and therefore I was taken off pain medication and given Tylenol for 3 days and spent NPO (nothing by mouth except for ice chips for 5 days. This drastically reduced my potassium levels and had to have supplements. Truly a nightmare VERY POOR PATIENT CARE...Please don't go to this hospital!!  If you have to please have someone with you 24h/7days.",

  "text": "This blond girl today, 4/9/18, response to everything is \"We're about to close\" \n- I walk in today at 5:38PM (after I called earlier and asked if it was okay to come after work and that I would arrive about 5:40) and the girl is  looking at me crazy as I walk in. I told her I came to get sized and her response is, \"What the other boutique couldn't size you?.....\" As if to say why should I get sized here if I'm buying from someone else... Obviously if I was going to another boutique then they would have sized me, I'm ordering from online genius. But I ignore it and tell her, well I called earlier to see if it was okay and the person on the phone said it was fine as long as I arrive before 6pm. So she's like well it's 10 dollars and 'were about to close', and I'm like okay fine. She sizes me fully dressed, 2 long sleeve shirts on, which idk if it matters or not but I didn't like that she didn't even bother to put the tape under the clothes. Now I mention that I had been there before and asked if it was possible to buy the sample dress i tried on if it fits now bcuz my wedding is in 2 months. I've lost a lot of weight and since and it almost fit the last time, just tight in the butt, I figured it probably would actually fit. She's looking at my sizing like \"oh nooo it's not going to fit you\" (incredibly rude, like it's not even worth trying on). I was like well it almost fit last time, but she's insisting based on her measurements that it wont fit. She's like well you can't try it on tonight we're about to close (which I didn't ask to try it on tonight). Then I say okay well can you schedule me for an appointment, she's like no we're about to close. And the other lady next to her was like 'schedule her for another day', because she could see I was interested in buying the dress. She couldn't schedule me tomorrow and wouldn't Saturday because \"only new brides get Saturday appointments, not repeats.\" So I took my 10 dollar measurements and just walked out. I was basically telling this girl I WILL BUY THIS DRESS IF IT FITS ME just give me an opportunity to put it on my body. ALL she cared about was the fact that the shop was about to close ....20 minutes before closing time, with no one else in the store. All I can say is I am VERY GLAD I didn't buy the dress the first time since it was going to be a time crunch, because I couldn't imagine being treated like that, just so unwelcomed, after I've already given those people my money..... \n\n-Gave 2 stars since the first appointment was about 3 stars very average, but this girl was a 1 star, probably a zero. She's pretty lucky I forgot to get her name.",

I was disgusted by the fact the nail tech dried my feet with the same towel that was covered in nail and cuticle trimmings and don't get me started on how gross the towels were in further inspection. I also didn't really feel pampered like I do at most places but the nail tech did a good job on the Polish and shape of my nails.\n\nBut here's the true kicker at the end of it I was charged $65 and normally I always tip 20% unless I don't feel I got extraordinary service (and it doesn't take much for it to be extraordinary for me I'm simple). I decided to tip $10. I looked at my bank statement only to find that they decided $15 was more of what they'd like to see in a tip. I unfortunately don't have the receipt because I've never had this issue before but I'm very disappointed not because I can't afford the extra five dollars but because the people here took it upon themselves to take it.",

BTW we asked about the bath when we checked in cause I am a big guy , front desk girl said was normal size and nice......\nWe checked in , as it turns old the bath was extremely small, we unpacked, and went to dinner. When we got back we sat on the beds, and there was serious issues with the beds, it felt like you were on a nosy old wooded boat. \nWe called down to front desk manager, and they moved us to another room, The new room was much better and had bathroom that was a normal size, and the beds were ok . !\nBut they moved us to a room by the elevators, it was beyond nosey, I assume the hotel was just so busy \nSo again spoke to front desk, they had no rooms to move us to, so we just decided to leave early they said ok, and sorry no problem, they understood... that would have been ok, but here it is....... The day they we check out they added $239 dollars to the bill for and early departure fee \nI said huh? Spoke to a new manager he was Rude, did nothing and did not care ! \nWe left with being billed and extra day for leaving early .. lol \nAnyway I called amex when home will dispute the charge. We get the money back ! \nBut in the end the last manager was so rude and bad; I wish I had the name.... But for his great wisdom. It earned this review \nIn the end- summary \nRooms were ok. Some rooms are very nosy, due to old thin walls ( hotel was built in the 1800's ) and I guess many walls or doors have not been updated or better sound proofing , you could not sleep . Some rooms have very tiny baths, and beds that have serious issues. But the worst was the management.... I give the place 2 stars",

  "text": "This bar was founded by Tatyana Telnikova, a Russian expatriate and cycling enthusiast. She also opened Propaganda bar on Cherokee. I actually gave that place a positive review. I think she did a much better job there. It's great. I'm giving Handlebar a somewhat negative review, but she has no need to worry. Handlebar is thriving and will continue to thrive.\n\nIt's a St. Louis powerhouse. Have you been to it yet? You will eventually.\n\nI've been to it so many times. It's simultaneously the Grove's resident Russian restaurant as well as the local hipster bar. Every bar hop in the Grove must inevitably pass through Handlebar.\n\nAs a Russian restaurant, it's decent. It's watered down by pub fare, though, and most dishes come with goat cheese in some form. St. Louis actually has a large Bosnian community, y'know. So if you're looking for Eastern European food, you can do better (and get a shot of slivovitz while you're at it). Telnikova's other bar, Propaganda, does Russian food better. Most people who eat at Handlebar order pizza.\n\nAs a hipster bar, well, it's not Tower Grove's CBGB's. Which is to say, you can expect it to be *a lot* more crowded on the weekends, and you can expect to find the kind of people who generally avoid dive seedy dive bars like CBGB's getting white-boy wasted from the tops of their Polo shirts to the bottoms of their Sperries here. There's an outdoor patio area (which, if you're here on the weekend, is the only place there will be room to breathe) where people will be vaping and smoking cigarettes next to bonfires.\n\nNeedless to say, the bartenders are often overwhelmed and already sick of your poseur sh*t. It doesn't matter. On busy nights, there's really only time to order a Pabst and a shot of rail whiskey, anyway.\n\nThis is all a roundabout way of saying that if you're 22, this is *the* place to be. It's a great place to take shots, do bar trivia, and grind on the crowded dance floor on the weekends. If you're 22, though, you aren't reading Yelp. If you're reading Yelp, you're probably looking for a delicious Russian restaurant. This ain't it. Honestly, St. Louis ain't it. Go back up to the search bar and search \"Bosnian\".\n\nIf you're looking for a Russian bar, try Telnikova's other bar, Propaganda. It's great. If you're looking to chug Pabsts on a Saturday night--well, you're probably already here.",

  "text": "Bought a new 2018 car from this place.\nA few things you should know:\n1) they are the stereotypical slimy car salesmen you read about \n2) they may try to alter some pricing/throw in their own financing for a rebate (same price of car just lower monthly payment) or some other tactic to make you think at first glance you've got a great deal - don't take this offer. Make sure you ask how/why the price is that way. Get the truth out of them. I got 3 price quotes and they all included rebates with nissans financing. I told them multiple times I had my own financing through my bank and would not be using them. They didn't stop giving me quotes with their financing until I told them I'd take my business elsewhere. \n3) they are willing to negotiate. Stand your ground. You can get a great deal here if you are willing to negotiate, know what you're talking about, and are patient. They are desperate to sell cars so the second you walk away they will come chasing after you.\n\nI did my purchase via phone and email from distance. I recommend doing this as I seem to have had a better experience than most folks who've bought cars from here. \n\nHere's what I learned:\nFind the car you want. Do your research. Call other dealers. Get quotes from them. Know what the average out the door price is for the vehicle you are wanting. \nWhen they make an offer, don't be afraid to give a counter offer or ask what they can do to lower the price for you. They can and they will. \nThey will email you a lot, they will tell you fake pricing over the phone, all things to get you more interested and invested in them. Don't take this stuff seriously, only take seriously what's in an email. \nYou'll probably have to be a little aggressive and stand your ground. They kept telling me they'd give me the lowest offer, I told them I didn't believe them because their price was higher than others, they beat another dealer for the same exact car for $750 less. They didn't make their best offer until I told them I had a better deal and that this was their last and final opportunity to gain my business. \n\nThe main takeaways:\n- do your homework before buying. The more knowledge you have the less power/manipulation they have. Know exactly what you want. \n- don't be afraid to walk away. If you're at the dealer don't let them pressure you. I talked with them for a few weeks and felt 100% more confident \n- over the phone & email because it takes away their power and ability to manipulate. if you can, do everything over the phone or email. This seems to work better at this particular dealer \n\nMy perspective on the staff:\nOverall, everyone is pretty slimy. It seems like salesmen are on thin ice and get a lot of pressure from upper management, so it's really not them who are slime balls, but their superiors. I don't mind at all having the salesmen make commission off of me because they are providing a service, but don't let them upcharge you for a car. I can't imagine what it'd be like in person, but I would assume they swarm like vultures. You'll have to be very stern about what you want - I suggest having your own financing here as they will really push for Nissan financing. \n\nGiving 2 stars because I did get a great car at a great price BUT the salesmen are super needy, annoying, and desperate. I'm just glad I have a car and never have to deal with them again (hopefully). If you can be patient, aren't in a rush to get a car, can get financed through your own bank, and know exactly what you want & what it's worth, give this place a chance because you probably will get a good deal.",

  "text": "Has success killed Ralphs?  Has being at the top of the creative cuisine game gone to its head?  Or is it just the natural evolution of restaurants in my hometown?  This was once my go-to place for special occasions; no more.  But it didn't happen overnight.  It started a year ago with desserts that tasted like they'd been bought at the grocery store bakery.  Then the next time the service began to degrade.  Alot.  It was sort of like they were doing us a favor by serving us.  And then last weekend, the total collapse became final.\n\nOur reservation for Sunday brunch was for 12:30 but being seated wasn't meant to be.  We retired to the lounge where the service was great.  The cocktails were well prepared and a nice starter.  The cocktail pianist provided especially relaxing panache to the lounge.  And the lounge, like the restaurant, has amazing ambience.  It's all about location--and the view from Ralphs is one of the best in the city.  But ambience will only get one so far in the restaurant business in NOLA, and the balance here has clearly shifted.\n\nAbout 45 minutes after our reservation time we were seated.  The hostess was businesslike in fetching us from the bar and totally unapologetic for the delay.  I'm not being pissy about that, but a simple \"we're so sorry for the delay, we had a late seating we were trying to manage,\" would have gone a long way in recognizing the inconvenience of the wait.  Actually, I suspect we'd have done better by hanging in the bar.  \n\nThe server started out okay taking drink orders and making some small talk.  She would become more difficult to find as the afternoon waned.  Not sure what was up with her, she was very pleasant and while the restaurant was moderately crowded, it did not appear that service staff were slammed.  \n\nI get the whole leisurely New Orleans brunch pace thing, and I'm usually a fan. Spend the time with good company visiting.  But we did show up to be fed, and that process was inordinately prolonged. Once again, the dining room was not packed, it was mostly full but that should not have taxed a well organized and efficient kitchen.  After we ordered, it seemed the appetizers came out after a very long interlude.  It took even longer for the entrees to hit the table.  During those times, our server became more scarce.\n\nThe appetizers were special, as they have always been.  The fried oysters in particular stood out as did the turtle soup.  But \"special\" stopped there.  Nothing about the rest of the visit was special, indeed it was the polar opposite.  Some entrees were no longer available by the time we ordered; or rather they were ordered but the server returned with the bad news.\n\nI should note that the brunch menu leaves much to be desired.  (Or perhaps I am just spoiled by the regular lunch and dinner menus; fair enough.)  But fried chicken sandwiches?  Okay, so if you offer it do it justice.  They were plain, dry as cellulite ceiling tiles, and pretty close to what you could find at neighborhood convenience stores.\n\nBut most disappointing the dish of shrimp and grits, that iconic of all brunch specials in the city.  This isn't a complicated dish.  Is it possible ours were plated in advance only to sit under some high tech plate warmer?  How else to explain the atrophied shrimp.  What once were likely some attractive medium-large shrimp had shrunk and were seemingly stuck in the now congealed grits.  Totally unappetizing.  Mediocre.  Or worse.\n\nThe desserts had not improved over the last time we ordered them.  Much like the service.\n\nI don't mind paying a premium price at a restaurant.  I have always believed that you get what you pay for . . . but that contract works both ways.  If you charge me a premium price, provide a premium experience: \n honor those who take the time to reserve a table, grace us with pleasant/appreciative service, provide a nice selection of food choices, pay attention to pacing of appetizers and entrees and prepare food that sets you apart.  \n\nThe final irony--I have two gift cards for Ralphs worth collectively about $150.  Not sure I'm up to using them.  Not sure a recovery plan is in place for Ralphs and even if there is, I don't know if there have the leadership to execute the plan.  Diner beware.",

  "text": "Regrub is one of those places you really, really want to love. It's new, it's been trendy somewhere else (Calgary), it's colorful, its menu is full of funny names, and it's convenient to the Whyte Ave walking stretch of pavement.\n\nI was excited to \"drop a pin\" into this nouveau burger experience, doubly so with a bit of the hangry. So the other half did the ordering while I soaked in the ambiançe: it's like the Teletubbies grew up to high school, got to plan a menu, decorate a space, pick a soundtrack and make social media accounts. Yeah, it's like that.\n\nThat part is all good. It's a fun, colorful space with happy, shiny staff. The fail parts are the execution of the food and the value-for-money propositions. Those could use a lot of tweaking.\n\nShe wanted the Lutter, a 4 oz Alberta Beef patty with bacon, egg, and cheddar surrounded by a bun of split glazed donuts. I liked the contrast of the sweet and savoury, whereas the 'bunny felt the donut didn't meet up to her Tim Horton'y expectations. (It tasted to me like a Krispy Kreme regular glazed donut, FYI.)\n\nThe Cheesy Jr., a 4 oz patty topped with mac n' cheese with bacon bits, arrived looking (seriously) like those Halloween caricatures of a pumpkin vomiting out its insides. Yes, there's pale creamy pasta with bits covering most of the serving tray... in a competition, this contestant would have been sent home. It's a presentation that screams \"I'm so drunk I can't even bother looking for flatware. I'm using my hands and lots of paper towels.\" Still, it's the taste that counts (mostly) but this explosion wasn't rescued: it was under-salted and nowhere as cheesy as it *needed* to be.\n\nMy ultimate measure of a restaurant's worth to me comes down to whether it (1) delivers a food that I can't easily make at home along with (2) an experience that's memorable at (3) a rationalizable price. Regrub fails on the former; I can whip up dorm-quality meat patties & KD without any effort. The middle; okay, interesting location slash vibe slash space. The latter; meh. Everyone felt mugged.\n\nThe worst thing of all? This is *so* close to executing well. Krikey, taste the damn food on the way out of the kitchen! Tighten up food design and assembly; try to be impressing someone...\n\nOh, and your Instagram counter behind the till is broken. Even that narcissistic rush doesn't work. Meh.",

Not only was Anthony rude to me, but treating us like we were idiots, aggressively talking down to us. I am in service industry myself, and my clients don't speak to me the way he did-- even on a bad day.

I felt like I am cheated on many terms. We were so insulted we walked out and ended up finding a cheaper price on the same car.

I got the feeling of \"don't bother me, I'm busy\" when trying to engage them. There is a propane filling station that appears to be on the property but actually belongs to the service center next door. When asking about getting a propane fill-up, the woman had no clue, was aloof and disinterested; NOT the generally helpful, warm and welcoming staff I am accustomed too at other RV campgrounds.\n\nDifficult to get into and out of. Ditch on one side, large trees on the other. Skinny, tight spots that must be BACKED into with NO ROOM for parking your truck once your camper is backed in.\n\nThe worst was some angry woman that just about knocked my camper door down demanding I move my truck from the empty space next to me. As she put it \"That is NOT a parking space, you need to move it. We have people in and out all the time. When can I expect you to move your truck?\" Very unfriendly tone of voice and on the edge of threatening. I get the empty space was not a parking spot but couldn't they be a little less threatening about it? Really made me irritated that the spot (along with about 1/4 of the park as well) remained empty for the next three days. Still empty when we pulled out on Sunday morning.\n\nWon't be back there in the future.",

  "text": "Simpson tea house, I really wanted to enjoy you and the experience of going to a tea house, but unfortunately it wasn't that much of a great experience in terms of service.\n\nI came to celebrate a friend's birthday and we had a private room, which was reserved for two hours of high brow laughter with the girls. We were served scones, tea, finger sandwiches, a litty bitty medicore sad salad, soup  and I can't forget a side of attitude from the owner.\n\nYes the owner was upset because we were eating cake, that was brought from the outside, to basically say happy birthday to my friend. As the cake was being served, the owner marched up the stairs and low key fussed at us about the cake in a unprofessional manner. She even had my friend sign a waiver just in case any of us gets sick from the cake.\n\nThen as we were leaving she once again continued with her negative energy as we all payed separately for our dining experience. I understand that bringing the cake in was a violation of their policies but as an adult and a professional bussiness owner, I would think that her conflict resolution skills would be a lot more better than acting out like a spoiled two year old.\n\nNonetheless I payed 40.00 for mediocore food. Overall the experience of seeing a tea house was nice. I did like the individual tea pots that we got served when we selected our tea and just seeing a actual tea house was nice as well. Will I come back, maybe, but I won't be rushing to this place.",

We asked to have it cleaned as there was not one table or chair that wasn't completely filthy. The floor had used napkins, ketchup, &  fries all over it. No one ever came out to clean any table. After finishing our meal I went in and asked to speak to the manager. When I told him what happened his reply was, \"oh, nobody came outside, sorry.\" I said that no one had come out and we had completed our meals. It appeared he could care less. I was very disappointed in his response. While the food was fine, it will be a long time before we ever go back.If a restaurant is going to have outdoor seating for dining, it only makes sense that it is clean.",

  "text": "This is NOTHING more than Hipster buzz words smashed into a biodegradable container. Not much else. Two things annoyed me. The price (one small one large = $18 and don't forget the tip!) and having zero smoothie samples available. So you'll just have to take the word of some apathetic cashier. You're paying at least $8 for extremely small portion sizes and questionable ingredients. When I say \"questionable\" I mean when I went and purchased a smoothie with banana as an ingredient. When I looked over the counter all the banana peels had green on them. Which means the banana was under ripe and that my smoothie wasn't sweet. Which isn't a problem because I don't like things to taste hyper sweet. It meant that the smoothie was bitter with an aftertaste. This place embodies what folks don't like about new Nashville: it's lovely and pretty but there's zero substance to the food in this shoppe. You'll do better with their bowls, which is the same fruit slop as the smothies, just with nuts and pineapples in it. And the pineapples save the slop. Save your money and treat yourself to anything else on 12 south. You're welcome.",

The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that my grilled chicken sandwich tasted fine.\n\nWe came because of the play area and because we had BOGO coupons. I wish we had just went to the park instead. We walked into the children's play area and were met with an extremely disgusting experience. All the tables were sticky, there was trash strewn about, the trash cans were all full.\n\nI went to get napkins and all the dispensers were empty. I was going to ask for more, but wasn't helped. It seems they were incredibly understaffed. I used my own wipes to wipe down our table (you can't tell an excited three-year-old that we have to leave before he gets a chance to play).\n\nAfter eating, feeling very uncomfortable in the squalor, I went to the drink machine. They had refilled the napkins, but I saw ants crawling in the sticky mess by the drink machine!\n\nI took my baby out to the car to nurse and told my husband to meet me there when the other boys were done playing and eating their stale French fries.

  "text": "Bailey's Range is the burger joint from the Bailey family of restaurants that include Rooster, Bailey's Chocolate Bar & L'Acadiane a Cajun themed restaurant. I have eaten at all of these but the last one with mixed reviews. \n\nAs for Bailey's Range, at one time, might have been one of the greats in specialty burgers in STL. Now it comes across as a tired once famous movie star looking for that final performance to garner an Oscar. We ordered our burgers off the create your own menu. Mine was a smash style burger with Gouda cheese, mayo, pickle, onions, tomato, lettuce & BBQ sauce.  The burger was not really smashed it just looked like they cut the thick burger in half and cooked it. The bun was tiny but delicious. The issue with this burger had to do with that the condiments were not fresh. The pickles had a brown look to them and tasted rotten, the tomato was watery & mealy with wilted lettuce. Ultimately, the burger meat was flavorful but at these prices the entire burger should have been epic. \n\nAs for my wife, her burger was cooked med well as ordered but again the condiments were possibly the worst. Her pickles tasted spoiled and the rest was as fresh as you can get from the dumpster. Again something that should have been epic came across like an aged Nick Norte crawling out of bottle from the night before. \n\nThe only saving grace if there could be one were the chili cheese fries. The chili was excellent and coupled with a not terrible cheese sauce on decent fries it gave us one enjoyable part of the meal. \n\nFor the value and the hype I would not recommend this place to anyone. Head over to the Dam on Morganford or The Mack on Macklind for some of the best burgers in town.",

The pan that collects moisture was not installed correctly so the shut off safety sensor was situated at the highest point on the pan which allowed the air conditioner to continually run while spilling water off the opposite side of the pan from the safety sensor.  So the last two years water has been pouring down inside our walls. They take no responsibility for the faulty installation even though their service tech admitted to me he had to correctly adjust the pan. Their excuse is that we did not have it regularly inspected by them and if we had this would have never happened?? No! If our pan and sensor was installed correctly the damage to my home would have never happen and our air conditioner would have shut off automatically. If you have their system get it checked out by someone else before you ruin your home.",

When i looked at the receipt to see if it was atleast written and perhaps just a chef mistake, but it was not.  So the woman owner who took my order chose to ignore my diet request and in turn i pay her and not eat lunch  if the owner does not care to do the right thing the most important part the order, then why would anybody want to patronize such a place.  There are many places in the city who care about their customers.",

Once things got going it was more or less fine. \nAll the appetizers came but not the child plate ordered. We had to ask for it.\nThen, in the middle of the entrees, a second order of the child's plate showed up.\nFood appeared generic, buttery and heavy. Deserts were fine: molten lava chocolate and key lime pie.\nSome bottles in the wine list looked interesting but did not have information on the vintage.

  "text": "This is a cool facility built in the old train station building. It is close to the sports parks and a few other nice places. Getting checked in is hard because there is virtually no place to pull up in front and park to get your room - plus - there are stairs everywhere - you will need to pay a bellman if you have lots of bags. The employees are all nice but the facility has seen better days. On the first night I was there it was 20 degrees outside and my room had no heat. They did fix it the next day but I paid full price for partial service. The restaurant was good but the service extremely slow - it's very understaffed and wait times of an hour were common when I was there - better to walk 10 minutes to the Hard Rock Cafe. On the last day I was there, even though I had a do not disturb sign on the door, someone from housekeeping tried to come in. How hard is it to read a sign that has three words on it??? The WIFI is good. The beds are hard. How this all impacts you nobody knows - but I didn't care for it.",

The tables in this place need a good scrubbing because a simple wiping would not get them clean. Everyone working in this place appeared to be under the age of 21 and didn't seem to care about anything. The food was subpar and yet they have the nerve to charge 18 dollars for it. The burgers were put together in a hurry and had no taste to them. The fries and cheese curds were good. Flies everywhere and I was not even in the mood for the custard after the meal.

I have short hair and simply asked that he take a little off the top and to make sure that the top is the same length all over. \n\nHe instead didn't actually touch the front of my hair but made the middle shorter and the back even shorter than that. He also didn't blend the front part of my head into the side, so now I have this cool front flap that looks like a misplaced toupee. He doesn't turn your chair around either so you can see what he is doing in the mirror, which I thought was interesting. To top it off, he loaded my hair up with hair product while attempting to style my hair. Shouldn't you ask someone first before doing all of that? I immediately washed it all out. It is clear that he had one style that he gives his customers. So, now I have to visit my barber to have my front flap removed. Edson's was a waste of $30.",

Despite being listed as being served with tahini, it did not arrive until we asked for it.\nHummus was ok, a bit watery and too creamy.\nBaba ganush was good, salad too.\nThe shawarma was terrible - firstly,it wasn't a shawarma at all, it was not shaved off a spit. Just chopped chicken that was grilled or fried. The meat itself was dry and tasteless. You cannot get a worse specimen of the dish.\n\nService :\nTerrible - the restaurant was Empty and yet everything took way too long. It took about 10 minutes just to get our drinks - iced tea...\n\nThe staff appeared to be on drugs - dazed and clueless.\n\nThe check:\nArrived with 18% gratuity tacked on. Turns out that on one of the back pages of the menu - the desert menu there is a notice that parties 6 and above will be charged automatically. This statement must appear on every page of the menu... \n\nThe owner:\nThe real problem is that we were a party of 5... That did not prevent the despicable owner of the restaurant to instruct the server to apply the automatic tip.\n\nWhen confronted, instead of apologizing and offering to refund the tip, he showed us the door poetically telling us that customers are like birds, they come and go, makes no difference to him.\n\nSo, you decide if such a loathsome human being deserves your business. There are plenty of other Mediterranean restaurants in the area that serve better food, have much better service, and don't steal from their customers.",

My wife was so pissed! The boat had not even docked yet and you should close at 9:00 when the curise is actually over! For $166 for 2 people it is something we will never ever do again.

Two major things stood out for me that I wish hadn't: my bulldog tasted so bitter even my husband wouldn't drink it, and it turns out the dry ribs were breaded even though there was no mention of breading on the menu. I tasted the lime slush on its own and it was fine, but The drink as a combo was unfortunately undrinkable due to the bitterness, and we couldn't figure out why. The bartender was nice enough to replace it with a vodka soda so it's not his fault. Most dry ribs are keto friendly and are not breaded. Our mistake for not asking, I totally get that. The ribs were very breaded, so we couldn't eat them and just packed them up and took them home. In short, the bulldog was undrinkable and the dry ribs were breaded, which like I said was probably our fault for not asking about.",

And then I notice my sideburns are uneven and there's a random divot in one of them. I used to bounce between stylists here, but they've moved on. Time for me to move on too.",

It's been 2 months and I've never been updated on my purchase I had to call them to inquire about it . When I called they were looking at my order and it had a bunch of stuff that I did not order then finally someone was able to tell me that they were just waiting on the table but the chairs were there . I scheduled a delivery date and they never contacted me with a time and as much as I would love to wait around I don't have all day . We finally get a phone call by the driver saying he's here ? He's at another location with the same address and we had told the sales associate about this and she made a note and it's been about an hour and 1/2 since he had called and won't respond to our calls and the other location is only 10 min away from us . So I'm not sure if this is being done out of spite but I'm pissed . My whole experience at this store was not good and from what I can see with there reviews I'm not the only one . \nI'm also only hold for 20 min already trying to contact them so they cantact there driver.",

  "text": "I would love to give Chow's a great review but they just don't deserve it. I've been working nearby for half of a year and I've given them plenty of chances but they just can't seem to get it right, even for a place that's basically just re-heating already cooked and prepared food that they get from their vendors (ah, yes, do you think they actually make those egg rolls or that wonton soup?).\n\nI have in front of me their Bean Curd Szechuan Style ($8.50). The rice they've supplied to go with it is not completely cooked and a bit crunchy, and it's certainly not hot and spicy like Szechuan dishes should be, but more importantly it's adorned with frozen carrots and peas, and either white or baby portabella mushrooms (they might have been part of the frozen combination, or not). It's not authentic, and it seems to me like one step above \"Chinese food out of a can\". I can prepare Chinese food better than this and I'm not that good of a cook. However, there's a lot of tofu to it, and it's a fairly good value as they give you enough that you can get two meals out of it except that there's not enough rice included to balance it. That's the best I can say about it. \n\nAnother pet-peeve/irritation of mine, but one that I really can't blame them for as it's their business and they can do whatever they wish, is that they require a $20 minimum for credit card orders. That's too much for me to pay for lunch, and I just never have cash on hand. However, Wawa just across the street will take credit cards for any amount.\n\nI've had just about every dish that they make at this point and I can only say that I am summarily disappointed across the board.",

I was wondering if I can place an order for delivery?\"  The girl who answered the phone politely said \"I would normally say yes, but we close in 9 minutes so...\" I said \"allllllllllllright then.\" It's a shame she didn't answer the phone and say yes of course I'd love to take your order. I don't care if you're closing in 9 minutes. You're not closed and you should have taken the order. I was staying in the quality inn, and I even talked to the blond female delivery driver cause I noticed about her person staying here order some pizza(and it smelled delicious). But I guess I'll eat gas station Pringles now. I would have had exact change cash plus a generous tip for the driver, but too bad. As the manager of a family owned business I know how much it sucks to get a bad yelp review, especially cause yelp agents don't care about businesses, so I'm sorry, but I was hungry, your food smelled good, and I have certain expectations for great customer service.",

Poached eggs although requested medium, were almost inedible they were so undercooked. This could have been overlooked had we been able to track down any one to have them replaced. Not once did any one ask how our food was or refill coffee. After 3 physical (getting out of my chair to intercept someone) attempts to ask the abundance of staff for peanut butter and jam while our toast grew cold, we finally gave up. Finally as we were about to leave, someone presented us with the sought after condiments which were not to our liking and too late but they still charged us $4.00 for peanut butter and jam! even after I mentioned the ordeal we went through to get them and that the homemade peanut butter was gross and tasteless. I usually give places a second try, especially if they are in my neighborhood as this one is, but not sure the prices, quality and most importantly service are worth it.",

You tell me it's not covered, that's cosmetic. You told me my warranty covers interior and exterior, otherwise why would I purchase an additional warranty that was already covered under factory warranty?  Ok, now lets understand I get over your worthless promise to cover my broken vehicle..i called several times regarding a fix I'm now willing to pay for and no return call.  After diligently following up with you my final answer was that it would cost me over $3K to fix interior trim...WTF.  Well you lost a customer for life and I hope many more that read this post.

We still had the old genies from our last house when the technician came to upgrade and install in our new home.  He did not take the old receivers with him after installation.  Two years later, I am looking over our ridiculously high DirecTV bill (having taken over the payment from my husband I was curious) to find out that we were still being charged for the old receivers on top of our new receivers and had been charged $21 extra per month for the last 20 months.  I called DirecTV to report the overcharge and was told I would receive a refund of $420 after I mailed back the old receivers.  I mailed them back and never received my refund.  One month and several phone calls later they are now telling me I am not entitled to the refund since I didn't notice the overcharge until now....they then offered me $40 in credit for their mistake....terrible customer service. Unacceptable behavior and just plain bad business.  DirecTV has lost my business forever.

Diet Dr. Pepper.  Nope, don't have that either. Now keep in mind this is one of those machines with a gazillion choices, but he said they didn't have any drinks that were diet. Fine. I turn to the back and ask what would be the next choice after any diet options. The people getting the meals decide on root beer. Turn my head around and say root beer. No response. I was about 5 minutes and then ask, soooooo should I finish the rest of the order then? And he says with quite a bit of attitude \"you could have finished you order whenever\".  And I said oh is that so?? You didn't think a response or acknowledgement would have been good when I said root beer? And he said \"I don't know, thats not my problem, but you could have finished whenever.\" I almost drive off, but 1. My kid wanted a stinking chocolate frosty and 2. A woman came on the speaker, I'm guessing the manager, and took the rest of my order. Then she apologized and I can hear him in the background screaming \"but I'm not sorry!\" So, whatever,  I pull up and another young man comes up the window and I can see the rude one was making drinks, thank goodness. So his little partner in crime apparently didn't want to give me my receipt. When I asked for it he rolled his eyes and then tried to give me a different one. He finally gave me the correct one and then said they were out of the chocolate frostys! Lol I said I want a refund. Then magically he said the manager got it to work. So my receipt says Taylor. The original one said Elliot. Who knows if they were the culprits that need to be fired. I wish all the employees were like the manager and didn't treat customers like a POS...but oh well.",

It was probably 10 minutes before our server first touched our table and our appetizer took even longer to come out - pimento cheese on crackers... Minimal prep required. The house-made hot sauce was delicious and a great complement to my smoked mushroom Benedict. The grits I ordered as a side did not arrive until the end of our meal.

  "text": "If I could give negative stars I would. Do not shop at this store!!!  I purchased a washer and dryer more than two weeks ago. The first delivery people claimed that I needed to remove the moulding on the door for them to be installed. So they left them in the garage. My handyman came and took the dryer into the room by  just removing the door. I could have done that myself. He could not finish the installation at that time so we left the washer in the garage because Best Buy was scheduled to come back. A few days later they did: two hours late. The guy said \"I didn't know you had steps. I don't have the right equipment to carry the washer up the steps \". I called to return the equipment but after waiting on hold for 45 min they said  I had to go back to the Deptford store. So I drove 30 min last Wednesday and they agreed to come today (Monday) from 12-6 to pick them up. No show. So I was just told \"they must have changed the schedule\". Really?!!!Meanwhile I went to Home Depot after leaving Best Buy and purchased a washer and dryer that was installed without problems two days ago. They even moved Best Buy's dryer back to my garage for me. Now the pick up is scheduled for Wednesday from 10-12. A manager said he was giving me a two hour window without the usual charge and that was all he could do. Wow, big deal! We will see.",

Every single chair and table was taken by patrons enjoying good looking ice cream bowls and extravagant shakes. Which reaffirmed my belief that this place has to be good. Upon arrival at the counter to place our order, I mentioned to the cashier it was our first time which he completely ignored and responded by simply asking what we would like to order. After a short wait we received our order and proceeded to a sticky table and enjoyed a silky smooth bowl of ice cream. The product was well delivered and met my expectations, however, the experience was below mediocre and failed in every single way. The sleek and contemporary design of the well lit space lacks cleanliness. Noticing such a large crew on site, but all gathered behind the counter and not keeping the common area or bathrooms in a clean manner is enough to ruin the experience. When charging a higher price point there should be a higher standard, not only on the product, but also on the service and premises which all together make the whole experience. I'm not saying I wouldn't try it again, however, I won't go out of my way to visit.",

  "text": "Where can I even start with Dolan Mazda? I'm writing this review after having my final bad encounter with Dolan and the service staff there. First off... the reviews saying wait times are ridiculous aren't embellishing the truth. Our family vehicle was purchased from Dolan Mazda back in 2014. We paid it all off in all cash after the \"team\" there promised a few things to earn our business. Well, when it came time for them to keep their word and honor the deal it was a clusterf**k to say the least. In short... it took Dolan Mazda over a month to get us the all-weather mats included on our contracts. Hmmm... shoulda known something was up then but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Took our vehicle in for EVERY service to Dolan Mazda. Each time was a minimum 3 hour wait for a SCHEDULED SERVICE APPOINTMENT! 3 hours to change the oil?!? Whatever, we have the extended warranty and guess it's worth the wait to keep our warranty valid. Weren't we wrong! Check engine light started to come on around 30k miles. Code was for a bad sensor in the cooling system. Took the car in to have the problem fixed and serviced under warranty. After waiting around from roughly 9:30am until 4:00pm that day we received our vehicle back but the CEL was still on...? Why?!? You just had my car all day and for what? All they did was read the code and confirm that the code was for what I told them. A few weeks later we go ahead and pay out of pocket for them to fix the sensor and do the 30k mile service all in one go. Cool deal, right? WRONG! Again... 9-4 waiting around in Dolan's uncomfortable dealership. Finally we get our car back. This is in the middle of winter. Thank them reluctantly for the \"hard work\" and head home. Notice my CEL isn't on anymore so that's good. Wait... why won't my heater warm up? Maybe the engine is cold or something. Head home. Halfway home I'm freezing even though the heater is on full heat and recirculating the cabin air. What the actual f**k?!? Low and behold, Dolan and their \"awesome\" team of mechanics managed to somehow break the heating system in our vehicle during a common service. When we called to report the problem we were faced with a basic \"not our fault and it's not covered\" response from them. After arguing and threatening legal action they finally \"Got approval from Mazda Corporate\" to fix WHAT THEY BROKE on our vehicle. We had to drive back to Reno with no heater (over an hour drive for us) to drop off our vehicle and pick up the loaner car. After about a week we finally got word they found time to fix our car that they broke. Jump to this week. A few days ago we call to get an appointment for 4 new tires and an oil service. Gal on the phone as well as the parts department both get the tire information and inform we will be getting Mazda's \"Buy 3 get the 4th for $1\" promotional deal! Super awesome! This morning I make the hour drive up there for the service. Prepared to be there all day because that's how Dolan operates. Tell the service guy that I'm here and have an appointment for tires and an oil change.  He apparently has no information of the call and appointment information we had given up a few days prior. Okay... at this point I knew it was gonna be bad. After he is the 3rd person to take down our tire size I confirm we're getting the 3 and 4th for $1 deal, right? WRONG!!! This guy tells me \"We don't honor that promotion.\" Really? After every single person on the phone quotes me with this deal you're gonna wait til I drive an hour out here to tell me this?!? Then I inform him I'm tired of the bad service and that last time we came in they broke our vehicle. His response... \"We wouldn't do that. I don't think that happened.\" Well Dolan, I hope you and your service manager and customers enjoyed hearing me cuss you out and call you all out for shady business and lying and breaking customers vehicles. You don't deserve the business of the great people of Nevada. Shady business and lies is just the tip of the iceberg with you. You have officially lost any and all future business from myself and all members of my family. Get Bent, Dolan!",

  "text": "When we moved to Ruskin 11 years ago, a neighbor said this place had the best pizza so we tried it.  It was over-priced and we didn't feel it was the best pizza we'd ever had.  Fast forward 11 years, my husband suggests we try this place again.  Instead of taking out a pizza, we decided to eat inside the restaurant. This decision pretty much sealed the deal of never eating at this restaurant again.  It was not clean.  There was also dust all over the wall behind the soda station and mold in the ice chute on the fountain station.  I'm glad I never had to use the restroom as I can only imagine.  There were signs tapped up everywhere and some tape left behind where the sign had either been removed or fell off.  The cashier and the waitress were not friendly.  Our children liked their pizzas, but don't order the pasta or garlic knots.  They were out of lasagna so I order the baked ziti with grilled chicken and my husband ordered chicken Parmesan.  The grilled chicken in my ziti was frozen not fresh and it was so dry.  My husband felt bad so he switched meals with me.  The chicken Parmesan was not much better.  Another piece of frozen chicken drenched in sauce and cheese to try and give it flavor.  The only positive was the pasta was cooked al dente and not mushy and the chicken Parmesan was not dry.  Their sauce is not much better than Ragu from the grocery store.  The garlic knots are made of pizza dough.  They are not put into a proofer to allow the dough to rise so it's a dense piece of dough with garlic flavoring slapped on it and shoved in the oven.  Disgusting not to mention still over-priced!  Next time I get in the mood for pasta, I'll just stay home as I can do a better job making pasta and garlic bread.",

  "text": "I wanted to go somewhere nice for my birthday, which was December 30th and my husband called to make reservations. When we get there we decided not to valet park so we just walked a block. No big deal. As soon as you walk in the hostess is there and since it was freezing everyone was crowded around there, making it hard to get in. We overhear her speaking to customers before us and she was extremely nice. Invited them to leave their coats, asked if it were a special occasion, and invited them to sit at the bar for a drink while their table was ready. I was impressed with this, until it were our turn. We got nothing except a \"do you have reservations?\" We were a little turned off by that treatment. I'm not sure what the issue was, maybe we didn't look as \"put together\" as the other people there? Anyway, we're seated at our table and the server was right over. He was really nice! We got toasted ravioli for an appetizer and they were ok. Nothing too spectacular. So then we were offered a soup or salad before our meal and we both opted for the salad. The house salad was good but please take note, there is an extra charge for this to the ring of $10 a piece. Had we had known this, we would have declined. So I had the chicken saltimbocca and it was pretty good and my husband had the chicken Parmesan. Maybe I'm spoiled at places like Zia's or elsewhere where you're given a side of pasta with your meal and at $25 a plate we hoped to have gotten a little more, but that wasn't the case. The atmosphere is really nice but a little too dark for my taste, but the food wasn't worth the $100 for 2 people and sodas to drink. I was more disappointed in how we were treated as opposed to other we observed around us. We will definitely not be back and this is mainly because of the service when we first arrived. I'd rather go somewhere else on the Hill if it were my choice.",

  "text": "United Van Lines set us up with their local group in our area Hollander International Storage and Moving.  We had an appointment set up to do a virtual tour of our apartment with Kevin.  We had set up the appointment with Maria and had received a confirmation email and text that the appointment was set up.  On the day of the appointment we hadn't heard anything so I called the main line.  I was told that we would receive a call or text with information at the time of our appointment.  We waited until about 10 minutes after the appointment was set to start and called the main line again.  The woman we spoke with told us she didn't have any information about Kevin and that we should give him until half an hour past our appointment time.  Once it was 35 minutes past our scheduled appointment time I called again.  The woman stated that she was unable to see any of our or Kevin's information.  She asked if we were given an email or phone number for Kevin.  I said that we had only been given his name in our confirmation email.  We were told that nothing could be done until Monday as it was the weekend and no one was available at the local office.  We will definitely be using a different moving company that respects our time.",

  "text": "Was recommended from hotel staff at Hutton hotel. First off it was 4th of July. Was way understaffed and had no hostess. Sat at front before we realized we just needed to  go in. Had 1 waitress serving around 15 tables, definitely a slow process. Beers ordered were warm and appeared to be missing a few sips. Ordered the Nachos, \"Belgian fries\" and the tavern burger. \n\nNachos weren't bad. I'd say above average taste and presentation. \n\nBelgian fries... not sure why they call them this. Are they made from Belgian potatoes and fried twice? Well I think they got the fried twice part correct. Fries were burnt and I only ate a few. \n\nTavern burger. Best part of meal but overpriced. $12.50 for a burger that didn't stand out in anyway. No taste distinctions or flavors that stood out. \n\nBased off prices, atmosphere, and service. I'd say 1.5 or 2/5 stars.",

About three weeks later I called because we hadn't heard anything. The arborist seemed annoyed that a set date was needed. He said they would simply come out the next time they were in our area, take the tree down and leave a bill. Huh, okaaaaay... So we waited. After a month the job was not done. To be fair, 2018 was a brutally hot Summer. So we decided not to disturb them again until the weather cooled off. Here we are Nov 30, 2018. I called two weeks ago and left a message with our quote # again asking for a follow up for the job pending. Still haven't heard back.

Now normally, I go to an alternate location and they're fine there, amazing even. I order one here & wow....it was terrible. Cheddar cheese? Since when? It's always been a white cheese, like mozarella or something but never cheddar. Found out that they just switched to that...well that was a bad idea. Worse cheese steak I've ever had. Even the peppers were bad. I had some that were hard and I couldn't chew them up so I had to spit them out into a napkin. I had to do this 3 separate times before I decided I can't take this anymore. I politely asked the waitress to take it off my bill because of how bad it was which she did. I don't know about their steaks at this location but if they treat them how they did this cheese steak, I definitely wouldn't expect anything good. I won't return here, I'll go to my normal Tucker's location.",

I am not sure if it is by direction of the manager or the cooks' own prerogative, but I consistently have received scant portions of food with a wide variety of meals I have ordered here. This photo shows a Steak Salad I ordered to go. I pulled the steak out to reheat it. I tore the salad apart looking for all the steak but only found these five small pieces. On a separate occasion I ordered the Quesadilla Burger and the size of the burger was on par with a McDonald's regular burger (sad looking thing). I have been to enough Applebee's around the country to know what are standard portions from the Applebee's chain. This Applebee's appears to intentionally reduce portions to either save money, prep time, or both.  It is especially bad with to go orders.  All this Applebee's needs to do to increase customer satisfaction and be more profitable is to bring the portions and the small accompanying food items (sauces, etc.) in line with the every other Applebee's I been to outside the state of Louisiana.  This is their key weakness and they lose a lot of return business because it.",

He never once asked if we needed refills. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't be frequenting this establishment anytime in the near future. I would suggest they get a larger staff to help during lunch.  so every customer receives good customer service.",

  "text": "Wound up here for Sunday brunch when the wait to sit outside at Race Street Cafe was too long. \n\nPros: All drinks happened to be $4 because it was their 4 year anniversary. Lots of pet friendly outdoor seating & great views of Ben. The blood orange tequila drink was strong yet tasty. \n\nCons: The beer garden menu is extremely limited for both food and drinks. Ordered the lobster roll and while it wasn't the worst I've ever had, it was far from the best. The side of fries was the most exciting thing on the plate. Sad. There is no server outside. You have to get up and order your food and drinks at the food truck. \n\nI think the restaurant not serving their full menu outdoors is a missed opportunity. They have the outdoor space and views going for them and the place would probably be packed if you could get a full service & full menu experience out there!",

Until recently I didn't even know the New Maple Hill Restaurant existed.\n\nAtmosphere: \nWhen I arrived around dinner time, it wasn't too busy. The outside is a cute, building with hanging lights. It reminds me of walking into a house versus a restaurant.\n\nThe inside has a small bar and a couple of rooms. It does echo, and you can hear every person's conversation in the diner.\n\nCoffee: \nThe coffee was good and brewed hot and fresh. It wasn't anything unusual, but it was good.\n\nFood: \nThe New Maple Hill Restaurant has plenty of options from all day breakfast, sandwiches, and dinner options.  It looks like a typical diner with simple options, but there isn't anything unique or special on the menu.\n\nI decided to order off their specials menu: Pumpkin Pancakes! When they came out, nothing about them was good. They didn't look appetizing, and they were paper thin. It was shocking they were a special because I could have cooked better pancakes myself.  I found myself hungry afterward.\n\nService: \nOur waitress was friendly and friendly but came around. We could have used more refills.  Our food came out relatively quickly.\n\n\nOverall Thoughts/Would I come back?\n\nI didn't enjoy my food. If I go come back, I would definitely order something else.",

I ordered takeout and it was just so cold that it made the meal unejoyable.\nWhenever I order takeout, I make sure to get there 5 minutes early in order to prevent taking home cold food. Because I'm not eating it right away, I want to at least take it home immediately. When I arrived it wasn't ready yet, which was fine. I waited and waited and my pickup time came and went. I waited some more and others' orders kept getting called out to be picked-up. Finally, I went to the register and asked them to check on my food. The bartender reached behind him and grabbed a bag that had been sitting there for at least 15 minutes and said \"oh it must have just came up!\" Now i was taking home food that had already sat around when I had gotten there early to prevent just that. \n\nI was very disappointed by this. I would suggest if you are going to eat there, don't do take-out. Dine in for sure.",

One refusing to sit us because it's the others job and she wasn't coming up. We stood out in the wind for 15minutes, not waiting for an open table but waiting for the staff to have their act together. Finally seated it smelled like pee. That kind of smell you get on dirty city streets but inside the restaurant. The waitress took another 20 to ask us for drinks. We almost walked out in this twenty minute period. We ordered all different dishes but they came out tiny, cold, and dry. I got the grilled oysters and the stuffed sole fish. Oyster were the worst I've had, and I've had them every night I've been in New Orleans. The stuffed sole was dry and lacked flavor besides salt. Also, if you like frozen food you will love this place because it tastes like a microwave meal. It took an additional 40minutes for the check and the manager of the place made herself a nice steamy hot stew dish and sat near us to enjoy. I wish our food had looked a quarter of good of how hers did. Just don't go. Paying $40 per a meal for awful service and food is a scam.",

Here's what happened...\n\nMy husband and I decided to try 312 Pizza Company on a whim. He is a pizza fiend, and we were in the mood for Chicago style. It took a while to find parking, but eventually we did and headed to the restaurant.\n\nThe first thing my husband noticed when he looked at the menu was the lack of Coke and Pepsi products. For us, this was a deal breaker. \n\nMy husband is autistic. His diet is extremely limited because of this, and it's not uncommon among autistic individuals. \n\nThe problem wasn't the lack of these products. The restaurant looked nice, and I'm sure the food is great, but once our server confirmed the lack of name brand sodas, we apologised and said that we wouldn't be staying. We thanked the server and apologised again. And then he was rude. Flat out, stone-faced, judgementally rude. \n\nHe rolled his eyes at us, sighed, and made the ugliest face, all because we didn't stay at a restaurant that couldn't meet out culinary needs. We never ordered a single menu item, so there is no excuse for the server's behaviour.\n\nI hope management considers this a good teaching opportunity for the staff here. I could understand if we had ordered items and expected stuff for free. But I hadn't even sat down before we decided to leave. It's ridiculous. \n\nWe won't be back, which is a shame, because I'd have gone sometime with friends or colleagues. Now I'll go elsewhere.",

Texas fries smothered in microwaved cheese sauce, calamari tacos with stringy, undercooked calamari. Burritos that you pay EXTRA for rice and beans! Don't get me started on the drinks. I had a strawberry margarita that was syrup on the rocks, my husband had a long island that was sour mix with a splash of soda. The service??  I could've walked out on my check 3 times before she asked if we were ok (I probably should have).... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  what a joke!!",

It was not the godfathers of yesteryear .Remember when there was more than one and it was GOOD??? Not so much now.

After a few minutes, no one had arrived to begin mine. 20 minutes later, still no one and I realized that there were actually no techs available. I asked a woman who seemed to be in charge if I was still able to get a pedicure and she said sorry give it a few minutes. Another ten minutes before I walked out.

They had the flat top grill off way before closing time and were using the tortilla warmer press to do the quesadillas and they came soggy and not good. The lady at the cashier was extremely rude and didn't even smile. We asked for water cups and only got one even though she knew we were a couple. Asked her for a fork cause they ran out in the outside bin and she was rude about it too and ended up just throwing a bunch in the bin and didn't even hand me one or say anything. Constantly with attitude and bad faces. The paint on the walls is coming off in some areas of the restaurant, some booth seats have big tears and holes in them. The restaurant is in bad shape and the employees form this night shift on October 9, 2018 are mediocre and rude. Not coming back or recommending this Moe's location to anyone ever.",

I really don't like the deceptive marketing of their game consoles.  Why do you need a game console on the table anyway?  Big button says press to play.  Little button says cancel $1.99 (or something like that).  Cost shows up on your bill.  Pay attention if your kids get snagged by the distraction.  Seems like there were free games in the past and when a big group gets chatting and having a good time, it's easy to lose track of what all the kids are doing if they seem happy and well-behaved. It's clearly set up to mislead and confuse those not really savvy to the approach.  Our waitress removed the charge (grudgingly and with a lot of unpleasant and loud complaining). Very uncomfortable.",

So like the good consumers that we are, we went to claim our prize. And can you believe it Walmart did not want to honor THERE coupon.  ZAMAIYA the \"manager\" needed to be called over to adjust the price because it was a coupon for something free.  ZAMAIYA told my wife that Walmart does not accept those coupons. Even with there logo and the words FREE RAZOR FOR YOUR DAUGHTER on the back. He/she also told her that she needed to buy one to get one for free. So my wife asked him to show her where is said that and he stated it was implied. \n\nSo after going back and forth for a couple minutes ( my wife refusing to back down ) he just turned around and walked away. She shouted to him that , we are not done here. He finally adjusted the price then mumbled under his breath b!t&$ as he walked away. \n\nWhen it was all said and done she asked the original girl cashier what the managers name was she claimed she didn't know what her managers name was the stated that she wasn't authorized to give out that kind of information. She finally asked another employee and they gave up the highly confidential info. \n\nWe have watched this particular \"manager\" treat other customers with the same kind of disrespect as he/she has shown us today and it is mind boggling how he/she even became a \"manager\" let a lone how he/she has kept his/her job for so long. \n\nP.S. the he/she part is not meant in any kind of disrespect.

  "text": "I am usually pretty understanding when restaurant is first open, however, this time I would say it is quite unacceptable.\n\nWe waited 2.5 hours for a table, which was fine considering that they just opened not too long ago. We finally were seated right away and greeted by the host. They did not have a couple items, which again, I was okay with it too since perhaps it was not readily available. The appetizer came within 3 minutes after we ordered which kind of confused me since it was too quick to be made-we ordered Calamari. Probably one of the worst I've ever eaten since it was blend and they were quite hard to chew. After that, we waited around 45 minutes after the appetizer had come out for our main course. At this point, I was okay if the servers were running around trying to serve all the tables and foods are coming out like crazy - but not the case; everyone seemed to take their time in everything. \n\nI've also noticed people were putting their name and number to be added to the waitlist and were told it would be a minimal of an hour wait. However, one of the employee (still with all the uniform intact) kept going out to the mall to wait for his friends, came back to bring them to the restaurant. This happened at least 6 times and there were probably 10ish of his friends that came. The question is, how is it fair for customers to wait that long and the employee's friends can just walk in right away and mind you they are being paid stat holiday to walk out to the mall, wait for their friends, and back to work? I've been to different parts of the world but this unprofessional behaviour was a next level. \n\nThen finally the food came out and they were less than okay. Tried the halibut with spinach and lobster butter cream and you can still taste the freezer burn on the spinach and the food was lukewarm too. \n\nThere are other restaurants that just first open and they still can manage their quality of food and the professionalism of the staff as well. Save your excitement and explore something else.",

I feel sorry for the non smoking crew members inhaling all that toxic smoke for hours working there.  The place itself is located in one of the less salubrious areas of Tampa.  Will remind you of an unpleasant Mall or Airport, that's how large it is.  Depressing place because of the patrons that go there, not because of the people who work there.

Had beignets from Café Du Monde and Poboys from NOLA Poboys earlier. Maybe for that reason expectation level was increased a bit. But still I think their shrimp po'boy was a big joke. Putting few tiny overcooked shrimps inside a chewy bun and calling that a Po'boy is a joke indeed. And it took almost an hour to get that sad thing. Not impressed at all.",

  "text": "Bucks County Restaurant Week 2018 Disappointment \n\nMy understanding of a \"Restaurant Week\" was to taste and enjoy a local restaurant that you've probably never tried before on a price fixe menu and the restaurant going out of their way to impress so that the customer returns. Apparently Francisco's did not get the memo.\n\nWho: Francisco's on the Delaware\nWhen: Sunday, April 29, 2018 7pm resv.\nWhere: located in Washington Crossing on the beautiful Delaware River\nWhat: Upon our arrival, the parking lot was full and I figured, \"Great, they have a great following\". Busy is good in my book.\n\nWe (my husband and I) walk in and there is no host. Well that's because they are busy I thought. No issue there. He returns to seat us in the tinyest room packed with 6 tables and a fireplace. Ok, I thought, it's a small restaurant with several rooms. Once seated I then realize we are right in the walk way to the bathroom. So many visitors by our table not romantic as I had hoped.\n\nWe are offered 3 menus; $25 prix fixe, $35 prix fixe, and the regular menu. I had researched the menu situation prior and knew what I had wanted to order as did my husband. Seeing we are seafood fans, the $25 menus had what we wanted.\n(Menus are in photos)\n\nCome to find out that our jean wearing host becomes our server (which he is obviously not a server). \n\nSo let's discuss service. Not the best but he tried.  He had trouble opening our bottle of wine with a wine key, then he up sold garlic bread but prior to the bread arriving we were given only one portion of the antipasto to share even though we each ordered off the $25 menu. \n\nThe bread was given to another table we were told and that was the reason for the delay.\n\nOur dry Caesar Salads came. The plates were chilled, which is great but there was hardly any dressing that you could taste or see. Yes, we ate them but come on we were hungry after the 4 olive, two bruschetta piece, two 1/2\"x1/2\" pieces of cheese antipasto appetizer. (All dirty plates remained on table until I put them on the corner of the table stacked.) I'm sure all the passers by to the restroom didn't mind looking at them.\n\nEntrees are a huge disappointment. Me the Shrimp scampi, this would include 5 32-34 sized shrimp that were flavorful but there was no sauce and the linguine was dry and cooked al dente. My husband ordered the Clams in white sauce, what sauce? Again dry linguine al dente and the weird thing was that the clams were broiled and not steamed with any juice/sauce of the white wine variety. So the flavor was not up to par.\n\nDessert: homemade tiramisu, this was a 3\"x3\" square piece w lady fingers inside etc. It was tasty but not worth $10!\n\nI could have made everything, not ironed clothes, not put makeup on, not do my hair, not drive 1/2 hour and not brought $25 in wine. \n\nWe will not return, ever. \n\nThis place left a bad taste in my mouth.",

  "text": "TL;DR version - first time visit.  Wanted to try something new for lunch where we could get pasta and pizza.  Food was solid, but nothing special.  Service was ... well, we generally felt invisible.  No eye contact.  No check-ins.  The place was busy, but not so busy that would explain why we felt ignored.  If the food was better, I might give it another try.  Because it was just so-so, probably not.  If you are hungry, want large portions, and don't need it to be good-or-great food, this may be a perfect place.  Otherwise, I suggest considering elsewhere.\n\n=======\nThis was our first visit.  I'd heard generally good things.  Yelp reviews suggested we'd have a good experience.  Place was maybe 60-70% full when we arrived.  Seated right away.  We were able to order in a reasonable amount of time.  Ordered a small pizza, three pasta dishes, and some pepperoni bread.\n\nPasta came with salad ... this is no side salad.  It could be a solid lunch entree salad on its own.\n\nPepperoni bread came out ... and it was basically half a pizza.  Maybe the description should have been obvious (shame on us).  Maybe I should second-guessed our order when the waiter said that he'd get that to go.  (\"Wait what?  Maybe I'm confused about what that is.  We were thinking an appetizer.\"  I would have appreciated an explanation like the pepperoni bread is basically a sliced up french bread pizza.  Are you sure you want that since you're going to have french bread on the table and you've ordered a pepperoni pizza?)\n\nAll four of us thought our dishes and the bread were \"just okay\".  At some point, I think we were all eating it just because it was on a plate in front of us.\n\nPortion sizes are plentiful for the money.  The taste ... not so much.\n\nIn regard to service, in our almost 75-minute visit, I think we were probably asked ONCE how we were doing.  Never got a refill.  Finally, a *different* server asked us if we wanted to-go boxes and if we were ready for the check.  I kept trying to make eye contact with our server.  It was like the server was going out of his way to avoid eye contact with us.",

Why have reservations slots in open table for 10.30 and 11 when u can't seat the guest at 10.37 and on top of be rude to quests. Last time here, fortunately we live in Nola where there are better restaurants with more courteous service. I am foodie who never writes a review, coz I don't believe in imposing my views.

  "text": "Was here on a family vacation for 6 days and should've looked at Yelp reviews. My mom booked the place after seeing mixed reviews on Trip Advisor. We should've paid attention to the bad reviews. The best thing about the place is its convenient location - we walked to all our restaurants and sights including the stop for the St Charles street car to Audubon Park. The second best thing was the service from the boy who helped out at breakfast! The other thing that was alright was the included breakfast - dry-looking scrambled eggs and sausages, pancakes that don't look good, bagels and muffins. But the oatmeal is good and there are raisins and dried cranberries to go with it.\n\nEverything else was TERRIBLE. I've never encountered such bad front desk service, manager, and housekeeping even at 3 star hotels in Southeast Asia.\n\n1. Cleanliness of the place - when we first arrived there was a dodgy brown stain on the toilet seat. We called up housekeeping and they eventually came to wipe it down. It came off easily - suggesting the housekeeping had just been careless. The bedsheet was torn on one end and housekeeping was erratic. The first night we got back they didn't make the sofa bed for us or leave bedsheets out for us to make the bed ourselves. One of us slept on the sofa. Housekeeping came into our room when we were sleeping even though we had the \"Do not disturb\" sign up. A few days later, they didn't come in to clean saying we had the \"Do not disturb\" sign up even though we didn't.\n\n2. Service - Front desk made things worse by being incredibly rude whenever we called. At one point we even had to speak to the manager and the front desk staff said they had \"many problems\" with us - no kidding. Because there are many problems with your hotel. The manager was just as rude as the front desk staff, probably setting the tone for the place.\n\n3. Wifi - My iPhone, iPad and MacBook had difficulty connecting the first few days and when I asked at front desk (silly me for bothering them) she said that Apple products have issues with the wifi. Uhhh...\n\nHonestly, there are many hotels in the area and I'd definitely rather stay somewhere else than put up with this for $240 USD a night. I never thought hotel rooms made much of a difference to a vacation since we're usually out and about, but this experience was stressful and unpleasant. This is the only place we've ever not left a tip at, and felt completely okay with it.",

Completely disorganized and there seem to be no system to how they were seating parties. There was an older lady with glasses that looked so overwhelmed. This was apparent in her demeanor. She didn't look like she wanted to be there and was disgustingly rude and dismissive. I approached to ask if we could get on a list (for a party of 10!!!!!!!!) but before I could say anything she told me to \"MOVE! I need to get back there\" with an eye roll. So I moved aside and thought once she placed the menus down she will at the very least acknowledge or assist us but no she doubled down on her bad attitude and continued to ignore us. Needless to say we will NOT be back. If this is how they treat you upon entering their doors I can't imagine how much care they put into their food. I would give this place -2 stars.

  "text": "Gave this place 2 shot and both times they failed.\n\nWent 1st time last year and we had a server that was completely forgetful and disorganized. Food came out at various times and one person waited a very long time for his food. Server may have been under the influence of something as he could not recall drink refills etc. He would deliver the plate and drop them all loudly on the table. The owner approached our table at the end of the meal and asked how everything was. He seemed genuinely concerned however we lied and said everything was fine.I regretted not voicing my concerns.\n\nThis year we decided to give them another shot. Only because we figured out server was just a bad apple and the reviews for this place are basically good.\n\nThis time we waited a very long time for someone to approach our table.A guy finally arrived and he REEKED of cigarettes. It was so overpowering it was nauseating.We ordered drinks and an appetizer. Again the cigarette was so strong we settled the bills quickly and went somewhere else for dinner.  \n\nSorry guys we gave u a couple of shots and its not working for us.",

  "text": "I came here for breakfast because of the \"look\" of it.  Aside of the cool jazz band that was there at 10 in the morning, it was cold and rainy outside.  They do provide heaters that only work for the couple tables that are sitting in front of them.  You have to walk to get your food all the way in the back.  They have a bar area and a restaurant area (which you can only order at).  They do bring you your food while your sitting which is nice.\n\nThe food was TINY for what I paid.  I was so mad.  They charged me 50 cents for a cup of hot water.  I was pissed about that, too.  The food wasn't even that good.  Right after we were done, we immediately left and got breakfast at a better place.  Don't even waste your money or time eating here.  They even wanted tips at the counter?  Tip for what!??  Here's a tip, lower your prices and hire a chef to change your menu.",

As did the cheese; it tasted like plastic and slid right off the entire slice in one bite. Not only did I have to wait around 40 minutes to get my pizza, but I had to sit, watching all customers who came after me, get their pizzas first.

Never received an estimate - never heard a word. What a waste of time! Not to mention the girl I met with did not give me any great suggestions at all. I ended up ordering pretty much the same exact stuff from Weinstein's in Collegeville. They were so much more pleasant to deal with than the representative I had met with there. Their loss. I would never recommend them. Although on a side note- I would say avoid these places unless your situation absolutely calls for them. My bathroom remodel was not complicated at all- easily could have ordered most of the stuff online for less money. And probably would have taken a lot less time. But live and learn...",

  "text": "Sadly I HAVE to give Walker VW one star even though they deserve ZERO stars. I brought my car in to have a recalled item repaired. I also told them to take a LOOK at my AC as it would intermittently blow hot air. I was expecting a phone call informing me of any costs before any work was performed..so much for expectations!!\n I received a call at 4PM that day saying they ran a diagnostic check on my AC and that I needed the compressor replaced and when they replace the compressor that they also have to replace some other item, that I can't recall the name of. The cost would be 1300.00. Then they told me the total for the diagnostic check that I did not authorize which was 150.00. I asked to speak to the service manage but she had left for the day. I went in the next morning to pick up my car and complained that I was not informed of a 150.00 diagnostic fee and that I was not paying it. The service manager had the nerve to say I will remove the charge THIS TIME. Like she was doing me a favor by removing the charge. You performed unauthorized work!!! \nThe story does not end there. I decided to take my car to a very trusted mechanic to check out my AC (read my other reviews to see the name, you won't be sorry ) explaining to him that Walker VW said I needed the compressor replaced and wanted to charge me $1300. He called me later that day and said your compressor is fine- you needed Freon!! This is the SECOND time Walker VW said I needed something replaced when there was nothing with it- the first time they said I had a bad Cam Scensor. \nThis delearship is the most dishonest bunch I have EVER dealt with. Corporate will be informed of their devious ways. \nDo yourself a favor and NEVER EVER bring you car to Walker VW for repairs!! They are SHAMEFUL!",

  "text": "After going to this salon for more than 1 year I give up. \nI prefer the dip powder and with the exception of today the last few times they had to redo my nails 2-3 times because their products left a pattern on my nails vs a smooth shine.  They even tried to say oh no it's fine, I would show him compared to their other results my were unacceptable.  Then it took 2-3 HOURS to get done! That's an extra 4-6 hours of my time!  Can you imagine!  I would have gladly been done earlier if the result was good.  I was getting my nails done on a Friday, they were busy so I'm sure it was frustrating him that he had to redo my nails,  so much so he said you should come during the week when \"we not so busy\". How about I made an appointment and I expect an acceptable service. \n\nToday was the last straw.  I travel often and the last time I got my nails done was out of town.   This salon will use the electric drill on your natural nails and swear it doesn't harm them. I don't see how that's possible.   \n\nAt an out of town salon they wrapped my nails to soak off powder then wrapped hands in a hot towel.  The powder (B.B. nails powder brand) wiped off easily with NO Drilling.  I requested a hot towel wrap, no response I asked again and finally got her attention & explained why I wanted it. Easy powder removal. \n\nThe man told me how I didn't need it their system worked great I stated I would still like them wrapped   The women said their will be a charge, I said how much. They replied $5, I said $5 for a hot towel?  Fine I'll pay $5 for a hot towel.  The hot towel NEVER arrived!  But the drill did on my nails!\n\nWhen he was nearly done with taking off my powder I said I guess I won't have that hot towel I said I pay $5 for a while ago. He went on to tell me over & over how I should buy some of their other services, different hand treatments, & not the hot towel & said it was a waste of my money.   I said but that is what I requested and it was offered for $5 additionally the other services he was trying to get me to buy would NOT be what I asked for nor serve my intended purpose.  \n\nWhen will these nails salons understand customer service IS IMPORTANT!  Not only that, there are tons of you I'll just keep moving until I find a salon where they are not only competent but customer service oriented.   \n\nKimmy V. Who provides s review right after this initial review works at BB Nails or is an owner.  He provides reviews to offset actual customer opinions. \n\n\nThe B.B. in B.B. Nails stands for \nBYE BYE!",

  "text": "I found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try since we get a discount if we check in with yelp. The first time I was there it was great, I actually thought it was one of the best in Reno till the second time we went there. We sat at the bar and at first everything seemed to be going good, the chef was good and quick and food was alright till after I ate a really nasty bad fishy tasting unagi. I literally almost threw up but I didn't complain thinking it's just that one. We decided to order the salmon skin handroll as our last since the unagi threw us off and disgusted us and the salmon skin is fried. As we're waiting, the sushi chef has the nerve to ask us if we really want the handroll and we're like \"yeah\" then he goes, \"we charge for any leftovers\" and i'm like, \"ok...what about the ones I don't like\"? he's goes, \"it doesn't matter\" and I'm like, \"even the one that's bad?  and he keeps saying \"it don't matter, you will have to pay full price for it\" then I got upset and told him that the unagi was fishy and gross so I  said, I'm not eating that nor am I paying for it. He goes, \"well, that's insulting when you're saying the food I serve you is gross\". He obviously wasn't understanding me. I'm insulted at the fact that I pay good money to be serve good, fresh food and should not have to be asked if I should stop eating. It's all you can eat for a reason! we were only there for about 30 mins and it wasn't his duty to charge me for leftovers, I'm well aware of that as its stated on the menu and if anything, the waiter should be the one telling us that, not the chef! Many sushi restaurant has that stated on their menu. However, they don't enforce it. This is the first and they obviously do, if they have the chef reminding you. We felt discriminated on as well. He was so nice and so helpful to the Caucasian lady and I felt that they served that bad unagi on purpose so we won't continue to eat. They were speaking Spanish to each other then all that happened. We will never step foot there again and I will be sure to spread the love on the horrible experience I had. Be aware if you decide to stop by. I wanted to complain to the manager but I felt he was in on it. Just horrible.",

We almost didn't sit down because we had a bad vibe that we should have went with but we decided to try it because the reviews were so go.  From the get go the waitress informs us that they're out of some things...French toast (but they had bread and they had eggs...and Ive made French toast before), Brie, and later we found out they were out of OJ.  Ok, we can live with this but is there not a nearby market to obtain such a breakfast staple as OJ???  We ordered a crepe, the grits bowl and the chicken hash (with a side of grits).  The grape was edible, the grits bowl was not bad (thus the two stars) and the chicken hash was nearly painfully dry and bland only to be saved by applying the side of grits.  So, so far, the place is nothing to write home about that but to further the negative experience the lead waitress was constantly yelling at the other waitress telling her what to do in between rudely informing other customers that their wait could be well over a half an hour because they're running really far behind.  Um, if you're going to air your dirty laundry at least do it in a polite manner.  Next up, we ordered refill on our water and waited....and waited...and waited....and they never came.  Finally we were brought our check and again asked for water...after waiting a couple more minutes we decided is wasn't worth waiting for and left.  WAY too many options in the area to waste any time on this place.",

They used WAY  to much butter, not enough seasoning, and not to mention their food gave me horrible food poisoning the next day.

I could only have a tiny nibble of those disgusting things.\n Now the sandwich with the lettuce and sauce itself was delicious. I just had to pick out the damn star of the dish the felafel. I wish I could teach them my grandmothers recipe because I feel like they could benefit from it but the waitress was not friendly and did not want to have anything to do with it.",

They put so much tables ( which was shaky and my husband asked for a coaster to put under a leg) around that there is no space to walk. Table was dirty and we asked 3 times to wipe it. Our waitress was a sleepy girl whom we asked 5 times for a napkins and never got ones , salsa and chips took her forever to bring( finally other waitress brought it). Drinks was brought up 30 min later with 10 min gap in between. Finally we \"caught\" our waitress to order the food which arrived on our table 1 hr 40 min later separately from each other. We complained to a manager. I don't think we will ever come back. For this restaurant is quantity over quality. Not the same one anymore",

  "text": "The food was decent. Got a delivery order and asked for extra katsu sauce because it was delicious in the past. They gave us three containers of ketchup. I called, not to complain, but just to point out I asked for katsu sauce and not ketchup. They laughed and said katsu sauce is 90% ketchup that is why it tastes like that. I heard people in the background laughing. My fiance and I really dislike the taste of ketchup, there is no possible scenario we liked a sauce that was 90% ketchup. Especially since we immediately noticed this sauce as being ketchup. Maybe Katsu is 90% ketchup and the sauce we got before was something different (although I know they called it katsu sauce) but I don't think there should be people laughing at customers like that. Granted the last Mamas we went to was in another state so idk if they do things differently. Then my fiance found a long blonde hair inside her burger (she is brunette, there is no way it was her hair and also it was underneath the toppings). The delivery was prompt and the delivery person was nice and friendly. In the end, these guys lost our business for sure just wanted to give others a heads up",

Told us he would page someone to help \"not his job\" - no one ever showed. We abandoned the merchandise and left. Tried to reach manager via phone it is a rigorous exercise to FINALLY get extension for on-site manager.

(as seen in pic) if you want ramen in nola, hit up kin and nomiya. now for the poke. i didn't taste it, but it looked disappointing. they didn't even have the imitation crab salad, a classic topping for every poke place. they had odd ingredients, like black beans and chickpeas, which are a good source of veggies protein, but not really a poke topping. overall, not my bowl of poke. \noverall, this is not my place. i was excited when i heard this place was coming, but it is hard doing both poke and ramen well. if i want poke, i will be going to pokechan. if i want ramen, nomiya it is. this combination place is just not doing it.",

This one is only a couple of years old and has to be one of the worst I've been to. To start with when we placed our order the waiter took our order and then said let me get my order book and had to repeat it again. Then twice he had to come back and verify what we ordered. I ordered the steak and eggs and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich plate. My steak came to me first, cooked ok with no seasoning, but was still decent. About 5 minutes later my wife got her sandwich and then I got my eggs and hash browns. My scrambled eggs were basically unedible. My wife then asked for mayonnaise and the waiter told her he would like some too but they were out and had been out awhile. There is a grocery store within a 100 yards of this Waffle house and nobody has the sense to walk over and get some for their customers. We're staying for 3 months in the hotel in the same parking lot and other guest have told me that their food was garbage also. Looks like some corporate intervention is needed at this location to get them up to Waffle House quality. There is another location a couple of miles east and I would walk there before I would give this location another dime!",

When I asked for it, the crackers were not enough, plus crackers were old and stale. \n\nMy main course was 6 ounce filet and lobster tail. The steak was done perfect, just not a lot of that that was aged 35 days. Lastly the lobster tail was dry and not very good. $399 for the entire meal seemed way to high for sub par food. Service was ok but it will be a long time before we visit again. \n\nOne last thing, the calamari is to die for so be sure to order it. The rest o the food I got was nothing special. Did not complain because in most cases the food they bring back out is even worse. They sure did let me down.",

He seemed to be in the back most of the time while the rest of the staff hung up at the bar. His service was not good at all considering it was almost a $100 breakfast bill for 4 people. He seemed way to relaxed and didn't really care. The food and coffee were not hot. The food was ok but nothing special.

The lady was like I will have to charge you more and you can wait for the other fish to fry, and I agreed. However, I asked that all my fish be cooked at the same time so that it is fresh. The woman refunded me all my money and was done. I didn't get upset, she explained that I was the one who ordered incorrectly and decided she was done. I guess she doesn't like her job. The food isn't good enough for attitudes like that. I will never spend my money their again.  Everyone has had better fried fish and wings before.

Shortly after they started turning people away and I found out that they were expecting a wedding party. They'd promised them that they would shut down the shop when they came but they're about ten people including myself who were already in the shop. The bride began fussing and accusing the nail shop of lying about their agreement. So they pulled all of the nail techs together to get the bridal party started and called the waxing lady to do my nails. Needless to say she totally messed up my nails from the acrylic application to the filing process. When it was time to polish, a guy came to polish and basically noticed how messed up my acrylic was and had to refile all of my nails. He annoyingly kept trying to get me to spend more money on other products and services that I wasn't interested in even though I told him I didn't want anything. It was an overall annoying experience and I'm STILL not satisfied with the way that my full set turned out. Won't be going back.",

I cut open my 2nd roll because I wanted to examine it and again no steak. The it had a chicken bouillon flavor. So weird didn't want to finish it. The beef is the egg foo young was tough and flavorless.. The egg part was also mushy.  I normally eat at the Chinese store across from overbrook hs but they are a cash o my establishment. I didn't have any cash on me. Their food may not be halal but their food is 10x's better. Not going back to Chan halals again... waste of my time and money. Now I'm sitting here hungry.",

  "text": "This has more to do with their service than the food, really but it started with the food, well coffee. My wife and I found we had a couple spare minutes this morning and she us used to really like coming here so we headed over. Got seated, outside, nice morning, good company, all is well. Was not really that hungry but we decided to split a so-so sticky bun. I actually quite enjoyed that aspect. My wife got a white-chocolate raspberry mocha, I got some black coffee. Not too shabby at this point, server was great, appeared to be training someone, was knowledgeable about the choices was attentive, until...\n\nSo when my black coffee came out there were some white flakes floating on top of it, not a big deal. When our server came back to check on us, I pointed this out and asked for a new cup, again, no big deal, was not upset, just wanted coffee without the flakes. She mentioned that it was probably just coffee grounds and took it away. Again, not going to argue, but coffee grounds don't generally look like dandruff, I just want a new cup so all is good. I believe this is where the problem arose, me, not arguing, not raising a voice, simply asking for a new cup because of the white flakes (I never brought up the dandruff thought I had). \n\nA new cup was brought out, but we never saw the server again, not for a refill, not for a, \"hey need anything else?\" Not for anything except when her trainee dropped off the bill 10 minutes later. We sat there for 30 minutes after that and saw our server visit with and give refills to every other table multiple times, we did not even get a look when I tried flagging her down and said excuse me in a voice loud enough for the couple tables next to us to turn. She was not rude, she just literally acted like we were no longer there.  \n\nI finally went inside to pay the bill and explained the situation. They did apologize and gave me a to-go cup, so that was nice, but there are a fair amount of coffee shops/breakfast joints in the area where service is better and have the same quality food. It's too bad but I liked the old set-up better anyways.",

Atmosphere was nice, an open warehouse feel to the place, with an outdoor section as well as a bar and an open view of the kitchen. The food was good but service seemed a bit off- We had at least four servers assisting us and it seemed like servers were running all over the place, as opposed to having a dedicated section of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I both ordered a small plate as appetizers and a main dish. They arrived separately in no particular order, which I felt was odd but maybe supposed to reflect the history of the cuisine itself? \n\nWe also had to ask for each thing we needed...napkins, forks, waters, refill on waters...we never did get the fork. \n\nAlso my boyfriend said he noticed one of the chefs failed to wash his hands as he came out of the bathroom stall...which gave me pause. Hopefully he washed when he returned to the kitchen!\n\nI would give this place another chance just based on the food and perhaps we had an off experience with the service.",

I also patronize their catering services during Christmas and other holidays. I've always the considered the food consistently good. I went to Anthony's on 5/9 for my wife's birthday and it was the worst dining experience of my life. Both my wife and felt ill after the meal. First the service, we waited 10 minutes for someone to show at reception. We ordered 1 daily special and 3 entree from the Signature Anthony's menu. We then waited 35 minutes for the food. We had to ask for Water and drinks refills. -this is all not that big a deal to me if the food is good. Problem it was horrible. No taste whatsoever. Everything was heavy and slopped over in disgusting cream sauces. The olive oil dip was rancid. Even the diet coke tasted foul. That evening both my wife and I felt ill with stomach in knots. The next day I'm taking antacids like candy and feel nauseous. A very, very bad meal.  Inexcusable or the price.  I've had too many good meals at Anthony's to not give one more shot -but this was really bad.",

Stopped by for dinner before the BSU basketball game and ordered the 16 oz Ribeye steak.  Medium rare.  About 4 minutes after my salad arrived I was presented with a piece of meat about 4 inches wide and about 1 1/2 inches thick.  I questioned the waitress if this was the ribeye and not the sirloin.  She assured me that it was the 12 oz ribeye.  Cut into it and was not even rare, but raw.  Sent it back for some more cooking and came back to me almost rare but not close to medium rare.  If was gristle and fat throughout most of it and finally found about 5 oz of edible steak.  The was the worst piece of meat I have ever had.  I told the server that and and she came back with a free drink card from the manager which I won't be able to use because I am never going back.  A ribeye should look like a ribeye especially at $18.99 .",

The server immediately greeted us and described the menu options in great detail. It was a good start to a 5-star experience. However, the food itself did not meet that expectation. My wife had the meat sliders. The meat was so hard that she could not eat them. She left most of the sliders uneaten. We also had fried green tomatoes. We had a difficult time finding the tomatoes in the overly thick battered crust. I had the meatloaf. It was uniquely made from a combination of beef and pork. It tasted OK, but was lacking due to being under cooked. I was not able to eat the entire serving because it was overly raw. The service continued to be outstanding, but the food ruined the experience. We were disappointed.",

Then we ordered and 30 mins later (I timed it) our waitress came over and explained they had some issue with the computer and they hadn't even started our meal yet. Agh! \n\nI will give them that they gave us a bowl of soup and some fries to tie us over so there is that. But when the food came out, it was subpar at best. I left over 1/2 of my sandwich which is really not like me at all. \n\nNet net food was not good even for bar food and service was sloooow. Won't be back.",

We were then told there was an opening in the vip room. There had been a cancellation. The vip room which looks like the main room had several empty tables. We got the menu which was the most confusing menu I've ever seen. I finally decided on a cesar salad and small order of the pasta.\nThe cesar salad is on a wooden board with five or six pieces of lettuce\nwith an anchovy laying on each and some kind of dressing dripped over it. (What a joke) Tasteless. The rigatoni with the pomodora sauce\nwas very spicy with no flavor. I will not be back.",

The food runner finally came back with a paper and pen and asked, \"What was it that you ordered?\" I couldn't believe it, but I simply wrote down my order. 20 minutes after that another manager approached me and offered to comp (refund) my meal. I might just cook or drive out to see family next year. I refuse to spend 1.5 hours at Cracker Barrel waiting for a 2 minute dip item again. I served and trained servers at multiple Cracker Barrell's for roughly six years, and I have never seen a system so disorganized and broken down on Thanksgiving.",

We made a reservation for 11 people on a Tuesday evening, so we thought we might be given good service for reserving a nice spot in the back a month in advance. The service we got at this restaurant was awful which sucks because the food was amazing. Our servers name was Casey, and she didn't smile a single time while serving us. As a party of 11, she hardly came around to check in on us to see if we needed anything. When it came time for the bill she wouldn't split it up for us and then disappeared for another 20 minutes for us to figure out who pays what. Eventually we got up and tracked her down to made her take down all of our orders a second time so she could make up each of our bill. We were sick of only seeing her every half hour and we were ready to leave! It almost ruined the night but once we got out we went to some better bars!

That might be popular in Brazil but I don't know. Not good. Tri-tip tasted like old roast beef. I do not think that the positive reviews I read could have eaten what I was served. It was not good. Mushroom fennel soup had nice aroma but was served in tall coffee mug and no soup spoon provided so had to sip and was too warm so would burn tongue. My friend thought it tasted like dirt. I really did not enjoy this meal. On top of that, half the tables had \"reserved\" signs on them. Once I tasted the food, I could not believe they would have return customers so think they put them there to either make place look busy or ease work of wait staff. If you don't have enough staff, just let us know then we order food which must be done prior to sitting down. I did not order their drinks but hopefully they are good because otherwise I have no idea how this place stays in business. Some reviews commented about unfriendly wait staff but ours were fine.",

  "text": "Wow. How disappointing and rude this place consistently is. Let me say this. The food is really remarkable. But there are other choices and nicer restaurants who care about hospitality than this place. I have been coming for years, but I finally threw in the towel tonight. The gentleman taking our order was so condescending, it was hard to overcome the harsh severity visit. He took my order (Greek salad with warm chicken) and I added a small side of hummus. He said \"it doesn't come with any bread.\" So then, trying to be accommodating, I offered, \"that's ok, I'll use the garlic knot which comes with my Greek salad.\" Silence. \"The salad comes with a wheat pita or garlic knot?\" I asked. Even more than sarcastically, he rudely said, \"Yeah, if you want.\" I was offended but I didn't react. I still tipped a little (for the kitchen) but I hate to say it- this is not the first time this staff has been rude to me. Historically, the curt attitude is consistently a problem here. The rudeness has to stop!! The elderly lady who was ordering after me was basically \"talked over\"- the young man knew someone behind her in line so he didn't engage her or thank her or welcome her. That was the part that stung the most for me. Nashville is a hospitality town. The team here has never been warm and fuzzy, so if you go looking to be treated kindly- find one of the Tazikis in town and skip this \"no soup for you\" type of place that really needs to step up or close down. Try kindness, it's contagious. But try any other place in town before you come to this mess of a place.",

However today was beyond inexcusable.  I often might be coming in before or after a workout so in workout gear.  Today I came in and was simply looking to see what items on sale (again or their ideal client as looking at sales instead of all full price). After wandering around a bit I had items in my basket and was checking out. Someone came and told me I couldn't buy a basket as it was for someone else. This basket didn't have a hold sign on it anywhere.  I was told it was a regular who was eating at he bistro and had other items on hold (again no sign). Ironically he other items I had well well more than the original price all combined.  I left because the firm attitude I got was you aren't our ideal customer and F$&@ you.  So I won't spend my money here. I encourage you to follow the lead and spend where they are kind and treat all customers equally. This is not an all customers are equal place",

We stopped one of the servers who pretended not to understand English (how can you work in Exton, Pa and not understand clear English?) but finally we got a server. The food was just awful. I've never had food that salty in my life. I told the waiter it was horribly salty and he shook his head and left. Also the waiter who gave us our food was wearing a hoodie. That was so inappropriate to wear outside clothing serving food. Our food also was served on ice cold plates. Who puts hot food on cold plates? The double cooked chicken was horrible and tasted like a mouthful of SALT. The shrimp fried rice wasn't salty but not great  either because there were clumps of white rice throughout. The veggie rolls were the only thing we didn't dislike. I can't believe CNN endorses this place because It was the worst meal I ever had out. We were so angry we didn't walk out when they took so long to wait on us. I am from out of town and am so glad they don't have this restaurant where I live.",

I got my body cream with the seal already broken and I tried to reach them to let them know I cannot use a product which had a broken seal. They denied and said I would have to send pictures to prove it. I did send pictures but no one replied my mails. I called them some days later..it was difficult trying to reach them.\nI finally spoke to a lady who said she would send me an authorization mail to return the product. A few days later I called again because she didn't send me the mail. She finally sent it and when I read the mail, they wanted me to pay for shipping the defective item to them and also pay an additional $8.95 for them to ship me a replacement. When I told the lady that it's not my responsibility to pay for their mistake she was very rude. She said I can as well keep the product if I do not want to pay for shipping.\nI regret buying from this company. I wish I had read the reviews of others I would not have been in this mess.\nPlease stay away unless you have enough money to throw around.",

They seemed like they didn't have enough people working and were very slow. Our waitress disappeared and only showed up to give us our food. I waived her down to order shakes and then didn't see her for the next 30 minutes when we decided to leave cash on the table for our first bill. I would have asked someone else for help but no one was getting helped. The entire restaurant was full of people looking for their server. We were here for an hour and never got our shakes!

  "text": "My daughter was in desperate need for a pair of sunglasses once we arrived in New Orleans and since California Drawstrings was on the same street as out hotel, we stopped in and quickly found a pair for $20. Although my daughter usually doesn't pay $20 for sunglasses, it was the best we could do on short notice and so she purchased them. Unfortunately, the sunglasses broke 2 days later. My daughter was not happy since she paid $20 and only got 2 days of wear out of them so we decided to see if the store could help us out. We were on our way to the beach that day and working sunglasses are a must for the beach. We asked if we could just replace or repair the glasses but the lady pretended she could not remember us and said they were \"cheap sunglasses and not meant for rough wear\". My daughter is 17 not 7- there was no rough wear. They were rude and unhelpful. It was unacceptable that their reason for not being able to help us was that their own merchandise is cheap. A $20 pair of sunglasses should last longer than 2 days. To summarize this store was overpriced and the staff is unhelpful.",

  "text": "We were super excited to begin our trip to Nashville for the weekend for the Kenny Chesney concert. We had chose this hotel because of its closeness to the stadium which it is indeed SO close. When first arriving the staff was amazing, the hotel atmosphere was decent and we had smooth sailing through check in. When we got into our room it was a typical hotel room with no problems except for the carpet not being new. When checking out the pool area, the pool shaped as a guitar was really awesome! It is inside and it is heated. When actually going down to the pool we had visible saw a cockroach the size of a large finger and immediately got out. Other couples had said that they saw more than one during their stay. We had complained to the staff and they offered us a $30 discount on our $600 hotel that we paid for 2 nights and a pantry ticket that is worth 5 dollars. We did not think this was suitable for a cockroach being in the hotel so they gave us 15% off our stay. Since we saw the cockroach the night before we left we just left immediately the next day. Throughout our trip Equan (man at the front desk) was very nice! I would highly encourage you to meet this man. The second night of our stay during the night hours , the staff was RUDE. We asked for menus and asked to buy some water and during the whole process the man could not be bothered with even ringing us up. He even gave it to us at not the full price because he didn't want to be bothered with using the credit card machine so he just took the cash that we had. When walking away he kept saying \"bye\" with such an attitude like we were giving him a hard time. All of the women who worked at the front desk were also very sweet. Check out was quick and easy.",

I was wrong and my second experience was worse. I ordered a burrito with only rice, beans and meat without the veggies which would seem simple enough. NOT... I took the burrito from the cashier at the drive thru window and went home to enjoy my burrito. Once I took the first bite I realized that there was nothing wrapped in the tortilla other than plain meat and they had forgotten to add beans and rice! I was in complete shock to think that someone could forget to add the basics of a burrito! I had to drive all the way back to try to get my order fixed which was super inconvenient. What's worse is that I arrived to find the door locked a few minutes before they were supposed to actually close (It was a late night meal). I went through the drive thru in hopes that they would help me there but they didn't. The person inside saw me at the window and did not acknowledge me even though they weren't officially closed. Long story short I called several times with no answer and knocked on the drive thru window at the same time. After a million calls they finally picked up the phone, came to the window and \"fixed\" my order. They still didn't make the bean, rice and meat burrito correctly. Just a huge joke.",

  "text": "I was in the Music City for a business meeting and this place is located across the street from the Inn at Opryland which is the hotel I stayed at. A friend and I went for lunch on a Saturday.  It was pretty busy and there was a 15-20 min wait. We gave my name and sat in the bar for a bit until they called us. Once we heard our name, we got up immediately and approached the counter where we checked in. Turned out someone else claimed our reservation! So we had to wait longer. We finally got a table and ordered. I got a ceasar salad with fried chicken. The salad came absolutely swimming in dressing. It was wilted from moisture and all I could taste was dressing. The chicken was excellent.  I could have sent it back for a redo but I was totally over the place by then. Totally not worth the wait or the money.",

They now have a very ugly dog as the logo they did away with the whimsical stuff like unique salt and pepper shakers. And they changed Kellys breakfast special and deleted the pancakes and OJ. To get the original Kellys special is $7 more.  Now it is about  $20 for what was $10.  Why change an iconic landmark for the worse.  Terrible decisions. I use to rave about Kellys not anymore. There's lots of other options where food is just as good and costs much less.  It's always a shame to see am owner try to inflict on customers what they like versus giving the customer what they like.",

No manager showed herself till the incident was over. I called the police as I was being threatened. The out of control young adults  robbed my iPhone and ran out mocking and celebrating. I spoke to McDonald corporate office and GM they did nothing to help or compensate me in anyway!

  "text": "On Saturday after a round of golf, I along with my father and brother found our way into Rusty's close to the golf course. We've been hearing good things about the restaurant, so my brother ordered a personal small plain cheese pizza and my Dad and I ordered a medium sausage and mushroom pizza. The pizza my Dad and I ordered was cooked on a perforated pan (which is a shortcut to getting a good crust) and it was really cooked unevenly. And another thing: The pizza my brother ordered was so small, it was just about the size of one slice and the pizza my Dad and I ordered wasn't enough for one person, let alone two people. In short, we were not very impressed with Rusty's, we had better pizza at \"Pizza My Heart\" and even \"Round Table\" pizza was superior. We won't be going back to Rusty's anytime soon.",

After repeating the $120 quote multiple times he said he couldn't do anything. So I asked to speak with a supervisor and then I was transferred to Richard. Richard said he was sorry and he could only offer me 3 months of HBO for free. I then told Richard I would like to talk to his manager and he hung up on me. In my opinion that is completely unprofessional and disrespectful. No customer should have to go through such an experience. I hope management investigates into this case and takes action.

  "text": "Do not stay here!\nWe were a bit hesitant in staying here from other reviews but we decided to give it a chance because I had a coupon and we were only going to stay one night. I have to say the front desk staff was nice. He took us to 3 different rooms before we agreed to take one because the other rooms were damp/moldy smelling. This was the complaint of others too. He explained that they had some trouble with the indoor pool when they switched to the saline type and some how that caused the dampness in the rooms. I can't see how that would happen but the pool was out of commission while we were there. We went out to dinner then came back to shower and go to bed. Well, there were no fans in the bathroom and there was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom and near the sink there was also mold there that apparently someone had applied the clear caulking over. So that had to have been there for awhile. The shower water stream was so weak it took forever to take a shower.\nThere was a breakfast in the morning with bland tasting egg patties, chicken patties, biscuits and waffles for the hot items, then had the other usual continental foods. \nMy husband was the only one who ate the chicken, I assume it was bad because he threw up about 30min later.\nThe coupon wasn't worth it. We should have heeded the warnings of others.\nI know I will in the future.",

Then I requested my spring roll not to b Shrimp bc I'm allergic & she was strange about that.  We got our food n ate.  I was not impressed the food was ok.  The pork in my rice was fatty & just not good. My veg spring roll had nothing in it no veggies.  Everyone's food was mediocre.

Had I paid less for my mediocre food & service I might have not been so upset.  When we asked the waitress about why we were not given lunch menus she said \" you need to ask for it\".  Since when is it my job & not the waiters job to ask them about specials.  Any other place will inform you about special either for lunch or of that day.

  "text": "Where to start. I had a friend tell me that Glory Days made the best monte cristo theyd ever had. Then I was informed they had chicken and waffles. Even though their inspection report was not that great... I decided to risk it. When I arrived, I was greeted by a young hostess. She was kind. I was walked to a small carpeted area in the back that wreaked musty smells of grease and dirt. The menu was heart attack food at its best. Against my better judgment I ordered a monte cristo and waffles & chicken to go. When the food came out it looked alright. The cristo sandwich is served with fried chips. The chips were crispy but tasted old as hell. Maybe bad grease or bad potatoes. The sandwich had more bread and grease than actual cheese and meat. It was $11.99 and not really worth it. It also came with a side of raspberry jelly. The jelly tasted off. I love raspberry jelly. This jelly had a funky tangy sour taste. It reminded me of old rotten fruit. They may need to replace that jelly. Just saying. I ate half a sandwich and gave the rest away. No thanks.  The chicken and waffles was subpar. Its basically 4 or 5 chicken tenders served with 2 waffles that are broken up into triangles. They drizzle syrup on the chicken and you're given syrup for the waffles.  I've had real fried chicken and waffles at Roscoes in Los Angeles. This was not that. \nI would leave one star but the waiter was really generous. So the waiter gets a star. \nThis place has potential. Get rid of the carpet or shampoo it because it STINKS. Replace your raspberry jelly. Put more meat on your monte cristo. Oh and why was the cristo on 5 grain bread. Eww. The texture was way odd. Serve chicken and waffles with actual fried chicken..not tenders. Also the waffles were not good. I will not be back.",

Our party showed up and, sure enough, it was incredibly busy. \n\nAwkwardly stood by the door for a few minutes as we weren't sure if we needed to wait to be seated and most tables were full. Finally managed to stop a waitress (who was just going to walk by us?). She told us it would be a thirty minute wait (also have a hard time believing that as there was no one else waiting to be seated, but whatever). Another waitress heard us talking and said there was on open table towards the back we could sit at, it just needed to be cleaned. Then they both walked away to attend some other tables. \n\n... So was there a wait? Should we sit down at the table? Should we wait for someone to clean it first? \n\nWe ultimately ate somewhere else. Would not have minded waiting as I understand it was busy. Just frustrating that we attempted to make a reservation to avoid waiting and then the staff was unhelpful when we arrived. Maybe will try again another time as those who were eating seemed to enjoy their meals.",

We just checked in today for our second stay and we have two rooms. We booked rooms with balcony's and the front desk said we would have the balcony's we paid for. We got to our rooms and neither had balcony's and the rooms were a quarter of the size of the rooms from before. And NO BALCONY!! Also the bathroom in both rooms look like they haven't been cleaned in a week, there was stuff on the floors and showers. We called and they said to call back in the morning? For 564 a night.. then one of the handles of the toilets is literally hanging off and barely works. Last time we stayed there was robes in the rooms and this this there was not and after calling the front desk the lady said she wasn't sure if the robes came with the rooms or not. There is also no fridge you can use and no fans in the bathrooms. The bathroom walls and glass and completely see through so make sure you're comfortable with the person you're staying with! We had to learn the hard way the first time! There is no fitted sheets in the beds (one mattress has a stain) also which is a extremely weird as the sheet slides off while you're sleeping and you are laying on a mattress pad. Also if you need ice don't expect them to bring it to you for at least an hour. We will never stay here again after spending a few thousand on the rooms for the weekend and getting terrible service. Also the bartenders we have came across this stay were extremely rude. Save your money for a luxury hotel because this is not it. Also forgot to add both rooms have had workers come in without knocking and saying sorry they didn't think the room was occupied. I feel extremely uncomfortable with that. Update- the bathrooms have still have not been cleaned and the ceiling in one room is leaking and soaked!",

BUT, my wife's shrimp po-boy was completely inedible. When we complained to the waiter, he said he couldn't do anything. So we complained to the manager who very reluctantly adjusted our $ 60 bill by $ 5. We waited for a table for at least 45 min on a Thursday. Many tables were open, but apparently they didn't staff them What a waste of time and money. Never going there again.",

I would put them in the \"specialty topping\" category of donuts, which groups them with donut chains like Voodoo or Psycho Donuts (donut with toppings like bacon,  oreo crumbs, etc)\n\nAlso, the biscuits weren't that flavorful and my fiance thought the same.\n\nI went out of my way to check this place out, but now i'm here telling you that you don't have to do the same and i would recommend you PASS on this place.\n\nI was going to give this a two star rating, but i really would never come back here and would probably prefer any other donut alternative. Sorry! Again, this rating is purely against the food + uniqueness + taste + my chances of coming back.",

There were waiters and waitresses walking around and it was not real busy as there were open tables.  Nobody said a word to us, ended up leaving.\n\nWent in again to try again on Jan 1, did get some service this time however whatever they clean their floor with is the wrong cleaner and they could have a law suit on their hands.  Walking on the floor I had to walk very carefully as my shoes were slipping very easily, I had to stand with my feet very close together in order from them not to spread apart.  My son got up to use the restroom and fell because of the floor.  Luckily he was not injured.  I had to wait a few minutes for a manger to mention the slippery floor.  When mentioned she claimed that yes it is a problem and asked if I wanted to fill out an accident report.  I would have if I already did not have a prior engagement.",

They wanted to charge me double the price of a new air-conditioning system and told me I needed to replace all of my duct work. The tech showed me pictures of areas where my ductwork was ripped or torn, and I just had it all repaired two months ago. I would not be surprised if she went up there and tore it herself. Anyone who says their quote is only good if you buy today and install the next day because they miraculously had just one more spot open \"tomorrow\" is a good indicator of a scam job. They promote all of these guarantees in order to justify their price, but from reading these reviews it is obvious they have no intention of following their own guarantee. The back-and-forth \"negotiation\" with her boss on speakerphone was unbelievable. Stay away. You can do much much better by going to recommendations from the app Next Door. I am flabbergasted that Home Depot would affiliate themselves with this company in order to boost their credit services and have written to Home Depot about my experience.",

  "text": "Prior to arriving at their beach front restaurant for lunch, drinks, and sunshine I emailed the address provided on their eventbrite advertisement. I simply asked \"if entry fee needed to be paid if we arrive prior to 3:00p.m.\" (the ad stated $10 entry for an event at 3:00p.m.) The employee responded \"no ma'am, wrist bands could be picked up upon entry\" Upon arrival I was told if we didn't pay $25 each we wouldn't be allowed to stay for the event and to enter it would be $10  to stay until 6:00p.m. even though it was 1:15p.m. I explained the situation about my email correspondence and the employee (Devone) stated if we had gotten there at 1:00p.m. we could have gained free entry. Confused and wanting to obtain a correct answer I went inside to speak to a manager. Kenneth at the front desk met us with an immediate rude demeanor. When I explained why id like to speak to a manger he snatched my phone with the emailed on it stated \"The manager won't want to come out to see this email I need to take it back to \"her.\" He returned stating the person who emailed me assumed I was staying the night at the hotel and not just a customer of the restaurant. I reaffirmed and pointed out in the email I never stating that I was staying the night at the hotel and would like to speak to manager about this issue since we are paying customers of restaurant and have visited this establishment many times. Kenneth stated entry is NEVER free at ANY TIME and that I was lying about the previous time I gained free entry. He refused to ask the manager to come out and speak to me because determined my issue insignificant to their business. If proper information was given we would have gotten there before 1, or paid the $40 in advance, but based on misinformation we were charged $100 with not so much as a sorry for the misundertsanding. Plenty of other beach bars in Florida who honor their words and treat all customers equally. I'll spend my vacation else where next time.",

It was not busy at all.  We stood at the front door for about five minutes waiting for a hostess.  There was a woman on the phone but although she saw us she did not acknowledge us at all.  There were a hand full of employees standing at the bar just chatting.  They kept looking in our direction but no one offered to seat us.  After waiting I asked if we should just seat ourselves (first time visitor) and the bar tender very rudely responded that we need to wait for the hostess.  When the hostess finally acknowledged us she told us that the kitchen was \"broken\" and that they could only serve a handful of items off the menu.  We decided to stay and ordered some sandwiches, nachos, and salads.  Pretty limited offerings.  Half of the food was brought out and then there was about a five minute wait for the rest of the food to be brought out.  The food was mediocre and although our waitress was nice and apologetic, the service was very slow considering the restaurant was nearly empty.  Overall, extremely disappointing.",

I don't mind paying for a good meal, especially when the atmosphere is enjoyable, but I do have a problem playing for hastily re-fired food served by people that seem to think you're lucky to even get that. I did speak with the manager that  confirmed the dish was indeed a re-fire. Not acceptable from a place that's putting themselves out there as a five star establishment. We do not plan on going back.",

Either that or our pictures are on the wall with a sign reading \"Ignore and give horrible service to.\"  So three of us went in there to grab a quick bite.  Feeling like something different, I ordered the margarita which was decent but came out with no salt on the glass.  50 MINUTES LATER, our two orders of snack size wings and the appetizer tacos had not yet arrived.  We asked the waitress just to bring the check and wrap our food.  A person, I'm guessing the manager, came over and wrote my name on a piece of paper and said that the next time we come in there would be a store credit for us since we had already paid the bill.  I do not know if we will return to see if they honor what they say.  But seriously, we ordered basically 3 appetizers and it took almost an hour?  That was ridiculous.",

I informed him the syrup must be out on diet soda and the drink tasted of chemicals so they might want to check it out. He said ok and hung up.

I said sure thinking it was Bully's way of turning a bad experience into a good one. I then waited 15 minutes for new plate to arrive. By that time my daughter was finished with her food.

First we go in to get the screen door, that was in the beginning of December. First they tell us we have to have someone come out and measure. Of course we can't pay for everything...ooooo noooo.. of course you have come back once the measurements are done. But wait... to get the measurements you have to pay a fee. Ok, finally the guy comes and measures. Now we finally have time to make it back and pay for the door. Great! OoO they have to order the door, that takes almost a month, finally the door the comes, now we wait for the installer to have time. It is now February 22nd, over 2 months!!! The guy (who was an hour late to install the door) opens the box, and bam! The door has a 2 inch gouge in it. Are you kidding me?!?!? 2 and half months and I still don't have a door. The solution... we have to wait for them to order another door... 3 weeks.. It is ridiculous how incompetent home depot has become. There was a time you could go here and get great advice and help.

It was a pretty small sign. We walked in and the waitress approached us and instead of welcoming us to the restaurant she got pretty nasty with us saying that we needed to stay outside to wait for the hostess. We went outside the hostess came and she made up for the rude waitress but told us we had to wait even though our table was ready because they were too busy to handle us. \n\nI can get over all of this but once we sat down things hit rock bottom. \n\nOur waiter arrived and made a joke saying I'm the lucky one who has to serve you guys. Well at least we thought it was a joke. Everytime we asked for something straws, a ginger ale he had a snarky comment. We were ruining the environment, annoyed looks that we were asking for things (is this not your job?). But he actually scoffed and rolled his eyes at me because I specifically asked him if they could add a side of fries to my tacos and he said yes but then brings me out the pomme frites on the  menu which is covered with feta. I can't eat cheese  and I knew the fries on the menu had this which is why I specifically asked if they could just make me a side. When I told him the mistake you would have thought I cursed at him. He snatched up the fries rolled his eyes and said whatever. YOU ARE IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TIPPED BASED! Act accordingly! \n\nSo as you might have guess we tipped but not my standard 18-20% The manager came over and asked us how the service was and we told her it was atrocious and we asked her to sit with us so we could tell her what happened and she just said oh it was the service? Shrugged and said have a good night and walked away!!! \n\nShe didnt even care to listen to what happened. \n\nNeedless to say never going back!",

The place was not crowded and we were seated promptly by a pleasent hostess.  \n\nThe booth was comfortable and we found the taps at every table very interesting - especially fun for those who like beer.  The interior is filled with largeflat screen TV's everywhere you look. I will admit I personally do not like this in any restaurant.  The place has a strong sports bar and restaurant vibe.  \n\nThe menu was fairly typical for this kind of a place.  My daughter ordered the Tuna Taco's which came with rice and beans and my wife and I split the Brisket Natchos.  The natchos were a 5 on a 10 point scale and the tuna a 7.  The brisket on the natchos was fatty and was not cooked for service.  The portion of chips was generous but the rest of the ingredients were skimpy.  They need to up their game - smoke the brisket or cook it rare and prep it on a flattop for service the way you would for a great philly cheese.  The tuna tacos were decent - nothing to get excited about but certainly acceptable.  We'd wished we had gone to Nacho Mama's.\n\nThe service was good and our waited was very nice.  \n\nThe bill was $28.73 before tax.\n\nWill we return - probably not.\n\nWould I recommend this restaurant - perhaps for someone who wants to tap their own beer watch a plethora of TV's and eat acceptable food.  Otherwise - I would suggest you try someplace else where the food and atmosphere are both better.",

  "text": "On 8/4/2018 I brought my cat in who was severely dehydrated upon arrival they took her back to be examined $85 exam.About 30 minutes passed and the nurse calls us to the back room and presents us with a quote of $3,292  to treat my cat after we advised her that amount was to much and we did not have that amount of money if they could please work with us on a lower amount and try to at least get our cat stable to where she was not dying or suffering (we do understand this is still a business), after waiting another 2 hours the doctor Dr.Tucker entered the room with our cat in hand and said here is your cat and here is the condition she is in as if to apply pressure to us to pay that huge amount she was really pushing for care credit and just placed her on the exam table and  in a very rude tone stated that is the amount that is due for treatment  and we once again explained to her that was a very high amount to run test on her if she could please just at least get her stable and we would take her to the vet to do the blood work and urinalysis (due to it being Saturday the vet was closed) she then just walked out of the room and left our cat on the table who was severely dehydrated our cat was on the table for 4 hours before anyone returned to speak to us and every time someone would come in they would just speak in regards to the money not once did anyone say anything in regards to our cat or even show a kind gesture towards our cat or even check on our cat who laid there no water nothing. After sitting there for hours finally they give us a different quote of $554.00 dollars which was just to give her IVYs and keep her over night we payed this amount and still our cat lay there not being treated for another 30 minutes. We left our cat there at 5pm and received a phone call at 2am from a different Dr. pm shift stating our cat was doing better but still was having some complications but she was seeing improvement this Dr. was kind and actually sounded like she cared  at 5:30 am when I arrived to pick up my cat Dr.Tucker the same dr who was very rude and unkind to us at the initial exam stated our cat had not made any improvement (our cat was actually moving its head and tail and looked at you when you called her name and was meowing) when we initially brought her in she wasn't doing any of that)but apparently that was no improvement in her eyes she stated that we should just euthanize her as I sat there crying and attempted to discuss what we should do with my family because she was our family cat and is like family to us Dr.Tucker then states can you please hurry up I have other patients I need to see and walked out of the exam room. This clinic does not care about our pets they just care about the amount of money you are willing to pay they take advantage of the love you have for your pet what they are to them is not pets...money. I'm sure she was pushing Euthanization to charge and additional fee for that.  SVH and Dr. Tucker shame on you for treating a animal like she was nothing as a vet you should have more sympathy it's easy to become cold and un compassionate when dealing with situations over and over that  it becomes routine at that point you should really reconsider a new line of work.  In the rush of trying to save our baby girl I did not read all the horrible reviews this place has. I LIKE MANY OTHERS ALSO WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Our cats name is Fiona and she is the best companion listener and friend to us she was more then a cat she grew  with us and is part of our family she counted on us and unfortunately we failed her by taking her to you. Oh yeah and the cat you wanted to euthanize is walking by the way and doing better no thanks to you.",

Trust us we have been to all of the steakhouses in Philly and this is one of the worst. As a new Landry select member you would think they would make an exception since we didn't know \"all their rules\" as they never responded to our email when we asked. Thus we will never venture into another Landry's establishment and this is probably reason #1269 as to why this place and other Landry restaurants in Philly are SUB PAR. Wake up Landry, you all have to wake up before you start closing your doors. Del Frisco's, Butcher & Singer and Barclay Prime are the top 3, in that order. Morton's is a no no and we would rack them as \"unranked\" like a crappy NCAA basketball team",

Since when is toast limp? Bacon was sub par and the lettuce leaves had black spots on them. Grape salad sounded innocent enough, well it is grapes with a whipped sweet cream and crunchy topping. It was strange and not a good strange. The cookie was half frozen.... not a good experience. But wonderful staff",

We said we would be right outside due to the high traffic of people coming in and out. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were chatting for about 30 minutes when we noticed people who were coming in after us were being seated. I walked up to the hostess and asked how much longer for Brianna. She scanned the paper, as if I never put my name dow, and I pointed saying where it was and that it was crossed off. She got nervous and said she called me but I didn't answer. I then showed her my phone's recent calls and that I had no missed calls.  \n\nI asked if they could accommodate us next due to the mistake and she said no and that I would have to wait 30 more minutes for a table. Ive worked in the service industry for 10+ years and would have never shoved a customer to the bottom of the waiting list. TERRIBLE customer service.\n\nI will never attempt to eat here ever again and I will make sure my local friends know about my experience as well.",

To expect a 16 year old motorcycle to work as new isn't realistic and in this case, unhelpful.  Item by item, tires cracked.  Fair, it's Tucson after all.  Steering - some play, prob forks.  OK, 16 year old and play might be expected, but to then say \"prob forks\" is a judgement, not an assessment.  Did the shop take them apart and check them out?  NOT!  Throttle action - hangs up.  OK, bike hasn't been used for a while, but no mention of whether this is a serious issue or simply inconvenient quirk.  Afterword, said \"just needs to be driven a bit.\"  Battery - 12.6 volts low test bad.  Excuse me, but isn't 12.6 volts OK?  Old oil change?  Judgement, not fact - fact was oil changed within the last week.  Brakes - fluid need flush - fact, done within the last week.  Misses at idle - you expect a 16 year old bike to run like out of the factory?  Coolant flush needed - fact, done within the last week.  Clutch - cable maxed out - finally, some real issue pointed out.  When mechanic finished driving it around the block, \"nice bike! Runs great!\"  Where was that on inspection report?  My judgement about this shop is SKIP it, no one needs nit-picky.  IMHO, the mechanic who inspected this isn't a seasoned veteran who can judge what is necessary from what is fluff.",

  "text": "I have lived in Fairmount since 2003. My experiences here have always been mediocre at best, so although my family and I eat out 1-2 times a week, we have not been here for 5 or 6 years.\n\nMy wife and I both had a chance to get out of work a little early on a summer Friday, so I said \"let's give the London a shot, it has been a while\". My wife was surprised at my suggestion, but agreed. \n\nWe picked up our 2 girls, 5 and 8, and made our way there around 5 PM. We were seated in the dining room sunroom area. There were maybe 4-6 total people inside, all in the bar area. \n\nThe server was nice, polite and seemed a bit new or unsure of himself. From here I will go to list form:\n\n1. Glass in sunroom is in bad shape, seemed dirty\n2. Server could not answer questions about the beer list and did not offer to get the answers\n3. Their produce had not arrived, so no French fries to go with chicken fingers\n4. Asked how many fingers came with order, 3 per the server, 2 came out. They did bring a 3rd once asked and the were pretty fresh/good\n5. Was told they had broccoli to replace fries, only to have broccoli rabe arrive to the table\n6. The bathroom is disgusting and in borderline disrepair\n7. Hamburger was ordered medium well, came out barely medium\n8. Lobster roll was tiny (smaller than a hotdog), rubbery and generally lacked flavor ($20)\n9. Side salads (we were forced to order because there were limited produce options) came out with the wrong dressing and were not fresh\n10. After our initial order, the server never again asked if we needed or wanted anything else. \n\nThe manager came over apologized and took the fingers off of the bill. \n\nWe finished up around 6 and during that time 1 other table had been seated, a family with 2 kids younger than mine. \n\nI want every restaurant in Fairmount to be successful, it is great to have options. Until something changes here, I recommend spending your limited time and $ in the other established or new places in our area that deliver a more consistent experience.  \n\nOnce again, my wife was right and it will be another 6 years before we eat here again.",

  "text": "Customer Service at the back is horrible\n\nI went there to buy blue crabs early on Sunday morning.  Had to asked like four guys to see if there were any more blue crabs in the back since the ones outside were all dead.  None of those guys speak English so each time I asked, they just pointed their finger to another guy.  The guy named Piah (or something like that) first said no more, but then said ok.  After waited about ten minutes while they keep on filling the display with ice and completely ignored me, the Piah guy decided to help me since I didn't go away as he wished.  He was very angry that he had to help me.  I told him I wanted 24 crabs, so he went and filled a paper bag with 24 crabs and threw it down in front of me and ask Good? in Chinese.  While my Mom and I try to decide if that was enough or do we needed more, he became more angry and very rude.  He told my Mom in Chinese to take it or leave it.  When we told him we want six more crabs, he was about to explode.  He acted like we were there to get it for free even though it was $4.92 per lb.  He proceeded to get us six more crabs and basically throw the first bag on the counter instead of handing it to me and threw the second bag into my cart.  He looks like he was about to kill me and all was because I show up there to ask to buy crab too early.  He just wanted to fill the ice and put out the fish on the display.  If I didn't tell people that I will cook them crab yesterday, I would have taken those two crab bags and threw them back at him.  Came up to pay and ask the cashier to speak to the manager or the owner.  The cashier said the owner is cooking and is too busy to come out to see me.  Cashier was nice about it, but all those guys back there are horrible.  Cashier said they had a lot of complaints about this guy and that he is new.  If you don't speak their Chinese language, they treat you like dirt and acted like we came there to bother them.  I don't know where the owner found these guys, but they obviously hated working there and it shows in their attitude.  \n\nBe warned if you want to get any service in the seafood or meat department at this MD store.  The MD in Pinellas Park is a lot friendlier.  I will try to very best not to ever return to this store.  If I need to buy something from them, I rather drive all the way to Pinellas Park to get it.  Wish I know other places that sell blue crab.",

  "text": "Faulty advertising and bad customer service. As someone who has done many different VIP experiences for various artists through multiple companies, I was very disappointed by CID Entertainment. I purchased the Machine Heart VIP Upgrade package for Kelsea Ballerini with the understanding that it did not include a meet-and-greet, but that it DID include an \"unapologetically pre-show experience,\" as advertised on their website. This would be my fourth time attending Kelsea Ballerini VIP at various tours of hers, and in all previous VIP experiences she attended the pre-show to interact with fans, play a few songs, and do a Q&A, which was an awesome overall experience I'll never forget. Nowhere on CID's website did it say Kelsea would NOT be in attendance at this event, nor was it mentioned on the email I received giving details about the \"Unapologetically Pre-Show\" which was not in fact a show at all. Essentially, CID is charging 79 dollars for fans to stand in a room and look at pictures of Kelsea Ballerini, and when I contacted them to express my disappointment I received little sympathy or assistance in return. I hope Kelsea chooses another company to work with in the future, because this one is making her look bad and frustrating her fans.",

Worst experience we have had. \n\nOur family rarely gets the opportunity to get everyone together and the holiday for the fourth was one occasion. My dad booked rooms and we thought what a great time it would be. Well it started a week before. They couldn't find the reservations so my dad had to drive over and sit and wait while they figured it all out. Then we get there. They tried charging a 40 resort fee Per room even though we already paid through Expedia. Then we were told we could not reserve beach chairs until 9am on the day you want them. However they rented to some guests the night before even though we were downstairs at 7am waiting.  The elevator to the 6th floor was broken so we had to go up to five on one then walk a flight of stairs or go to end of property to get the next elevator.  Even though it's supposed to be a resort it's not a private beach and they have a shallow lagoon area where they allow boats and jet skis to  come into the shallow water and anchor while playing loud vulgar rap music. Not good for kids trying to swim. Then we were told no coolers were allowed but when we complained about the boats they tell us it's a public beach - how can they allow anyone to come in a boat, use their beach and bring their own coolers but for those that paid 250 a night that we can't?  At night they have live music but they also charge a cover and let anyone else in - this is not a resort, it's a hotel with a night club basically. I called weeks ahead for reservations for their buffet and were told they had no reservations available or room for our party but was able to book four separate reservations at prime time through open table. The staff is rude and not friendly at all and the management is even worse. They have no clue how to run a resort and it's a total cluster. Do yourself a favor and book anywhere but here - especially if you have kids and want a relaxing time.",

  "text": "I walked into this restaurant raving to my boyfriend about the salad and breadsticks and how excited I was for him to try it. We walked in and saw there might be a wait, but didn't mind. It was about 9:30pm on Satruday September 8th. I walked in excited and the host walks up, doesn't even say hello, immitadiatly greets me with the rudest additude and goes \"How many?\" And I said 2 please! And without even looking up she says, \"Its a 30 minute wait.\" I said okay thats fine. And she says \"name?\" And my boyfriend gave his name. James. She was so rude and it was so off putting that both of our moods instantly changed. As a host you are the first face a customer sees. I immediately thought if she is acting like this how will the service be? So I walked back up and gave her the buzzer and my boyfriend and I left off to find a restaurant where we will be treated well and respected upon walking in. We want to feel like those at the restaurant we are eating in want us to be there. Maybe she was having a bad day, but she should NOT be working the front desk her attitude was unprofessional and ridiculous. I will never go back to the Olive Garden Springfeild location.",

I checked in late one evening, the day before my wedding, as my first look was there. I was staying in a suite, and paid a pretty price for it. The person checking me in was a little out of it, but nice enough. Once I was checked in, and was told my room is on the 6th floor and tricky to find, she asked if I'd be willing to ask the bell man for help...  he was extremely rude and wouldn't help then told me I can take the cart but needed to return it back to him... The restaurant was god awful, I couldn't even eat. Ordered chicken and green beans. The beans were still frozen, the chicken and potatoes were so dry and salty, it was horrible. The following day, the AC stopped working, as I was getting ready for my wedding!!!! When I called to let them know they were annoyed that I called. Then hours later nothing changed. I called again(3x) until they finally sent someone up. Who was as rude as everyone else I had come into contact with. I reached out 2-3 times to discuss my experience with management and no one bothered responding.. I don't write many reviews, but this definitely deserved one. If you can, stay somewhere else... literally anywhere else.",

This is one of the very few times yelp has misdirected and lied to me. I do not know how this place has so many 5 star reviews. I ordered the stuffed shrimp as an appetizer and  boudin balls, they were both just OK.  It wasn't 5 star worthy at all. I also had the blackened red fish which taste more like a cheap swai fish. Whatever pudding textured sauce, stuff under the fish did nothing to enhance the flavor, it really had no flavor whatsoever. I started to add seasoning to the red fish which was bland and not very flavorful eirher. I ordered a side of seafood dressing which taste like molasses cookies, I didn't taste any seafood in the seafood dressing it was horrible. The sides that you get are on a small saucer so I have red beans and rice and greens enough of it to feed a 3 yr old. I didn't go home hungry because I got two appetizers not because my plate was so full. The service was okay but everything else the food was just not anywhere near what I was expecting. I really do not know how this place got all these 5 stars w 2000 reviews. I just don't understand, how this is even possible because I was so very underwhelmed by this food. I give the food 1 star.",

I asked the waiter to please bring it back and add hollandaise, which he did.  \n\nMy lady friend ordered crab Benedict. When I asked her opinion of her breakfast, she said \"it was nasty\".  There was a piece in hers that she had pulled out of her mouth which had crab leg shell. She asked for a spicy Bloody Mary, but it wasn't spicy at all, and she had to add hot sauce to it.\n\nMy male friend commented that his had browns weren't crispy whatsoever and we're more like potato mush.  He pulled out something he almost broke his tooth on which when we all examined it we determined it was a bone shard. \n\nMy dish was pretty tasty, once they brought it back and added the hollandaise sauce. The hash browns had a nice flavor but definitely should have been a little crisper. There was also one giant hunk of hash browns within that pile on my dish that was rock-hard in a clump and I swear I almost broke a tooth when I tried to chew it before I realized it was a hard clump. \n\nFrom where I sat beside the kitchen door, in my view was a garbage can leaving up against the area where the cashier is. The floor under and around that garbage pail, and the wall behind it, looked like it hasn't seen a mop or been wiped down in literal eternity.

We sat there for about 10 minutes when finally a waitress came by and said \"I'll be back with some waters.\" Another 5 minutes go by. \"Here, anything else for you to drink?\" I ask for my favorite shake. She literally rolled her eyes, said \"one second, I'll be right back.\" \n\nAs she walked away I hear her say to another waitress, \"I don't have time to make damn shakes.\" She then returned and said, \"We're short right now and I just don't have the time to make a shake.\" And she walked away! \n\nI've never had a waitress be so rude! I understand it's stressful being short staffed, but a kind apology and a simple, \"I can get that for you, I just want to let you know it may take a little extra time at the moment\" would have been just fine. My boyfriend and I were so taken aback. We just got up and left. So sad to see such a well known place go so downhill.",

  "text": "We stayed at this hotel back when it was the Fess Parker resort and had had a wonderful time.  Despite the incredibly high prices Hilton now charges, nostalgia took us back for our 32nd wedding anniversary. Big mistake.\nOur stay started out okay. The hotel staff greeted us reasonably promptly. Our room was large and clean. Parts of the hotel, however, seemed dated and a bit dingy.\nThere was at least one wedding taking place Friday night, which generated a lot of noise until quite late.\nBut it was the next morning that was the problem. There was a fundraising walk taking place in Santa Barbara, which ended at the hotel lobby. We were awakened at about 8:30 am or so by a bunch of high school cheerleaders standing more or less below our room drumming and cheering the walkers. The drumming was so loud that even with the patio door closed it was deafening. We could not go back to sleep. We could barely hear one another.\nI called down to the management office to find our what was going on. The manager blatantly lied. She claimed she did not know what was taking place and that any noise was coming from off hotel property. A few minutes later I went down to the lobby to discover that walkers were streaming through the lobby and confirmed that the drummers were on hotel property. Why I was told such a blatant lie is a mystery.\nRuined our stay. We left early and the one decent thing the Hilton did was to waive the charge for the second night.\nStill, we won't go back.",

  "text": "We enrolled our child in the 3 yr. old program at Primrose and she had a wonderful experience.  She came home each day excited to share what she had learned.  That all changed when she entered the 4 yr. old program.  Several weeks into the year, we knew that something was wrong.  She was no longer excited at the end of the day and when asked what she had learned, her reply was \"nothing\".  We communicated our concerns to the directors and after several weeks of insistence, the directors finally investigated the classroom.  What they found was that the teacher, who had been hired just a few weeks before the year began, who had a degree in Apparel Design and Fashion Merchandising and not Early Childhood Education, was teaching material that was a full year ahead of the age group of her class.  Without our insistence, the directors would not have been aware.  There was obviously, no governance or oversight of the classroom.  So that our child was in fact \"learning nothing\" and had not learned for the previous three months.  Needless to say, this set the tone for the remainder of the year.  We were overwhelmed at the end of each day with the offenses that our child had committed, such as throwing mulch on the playground or getting up to hug the teacher. Never, were we informed of any areas of positive accomplishments, When we finally withdrew our child from the program, she had begun referring to herself as one of the \"bad kids\" at the school.  Parents, grandparents, please advocate for your children and do not expose them to the type of treatment and lack of care and concern that we experienced from the \"teachers\" and \"directors\" of this school.",

The quality and presentation didn't match up to what we wanted. We eat sushi very often so we know what it look like and should taste like. That was not worth the money at all. We also had the chicken and shrimp dumplings, it was okay, very strong shrimp taste. But wasn't hot when it came out. \n\nPrice- Too expensive for bad quality fish.",

Some rooms are very nosy, due to old thin walls ( hotel was built in the 1800's ) and I guess many walls or doors have not been updated or better sound proofing , we could not sleep rooms to noset. Some rooms have very tiny baths, and beds that have serious issues. But the worst was the management.... I give the place 3 stars",

Over the course of a week, I had the prescription needed sent by doctor directly to them and then was told repeatedly that the order would be processed and expressed shipped in order to get a certain date, as I am going out of county and need this medication prior to leaving. After 4 days of calling Express Scripts because the online account does not reflect this shipping/processing date and 4 times being told- Yes, 100%, it is confirmed to be shipped this Tuesday with overnight delivery and the pharmacy back end has confirmed it's shipping date as well, I was told \"No. There's nothing we can do about it. It won't be mailed for another 24-48 hours because there is a temperature sensitive item being shipped.\" Infuriating. I have received this medication for the past 2 years with NO time sensitive warnings, it's always been left on my porch no matter the weather. When I asked what they would do to remedy this issue, they stated the couldn't do anything to rush the order. They then referred me to local pharmacy- I'm now in the middle of trying to see if my prescription will be covered through a walk-in pharm (insurance has the ability to deny this for this medication) and attempt to coordinate all of this through the pharm and doctor office, who now has to send over ANOTHER script for this medication as it can't transfer from Express Scripts.\nHow many terrible reviews does it take for change to happen at Express Scripts? I'll be making a formal complaint with the company later today (or tomorrow if today get's taken up with figuring out getting the medication from the pharmacy) and will be contacting Duke University to alert them to the continual absymal service I continue to receive.",

Scarfed it down in my Uber ride back to the hotel as I was ravenous!While the beer was comped, I was still asked to pay for the meal. That was insulting. Please note that this is my first negative review ever posted after years on yelp.",

I bought several tacos and a order of churros but when I got home the churros where completely burnt, so I placed a second order for more tacos today and I told them about my incident with the burnt churros and instead of making it right the manager Marin decided that he would rather argue with me than assist, I will never go back in there and you shouldn't waste your time either.",

It was a Friday night so waited a really looong time to be seated but it seemed like we were the only ones waiting because everyone who walked in got a table right away. After about 30 mins we were sat down and our waiter Joseph who an absolute doll brought us water and was attentive to us through our our visit. We ordered the pot stickers which I did not enjoy the pork was too mushy. It was like the consistency of tuna out of a can. We also ordered the beef chow mein it was okay. There was no flavor different between the noodles and the beef. We also ordered a spicy tuna roll which was soso. The last dish that saved the night was the general chicken and broccoli! It was very flavorful and delicious.",

  "text": "UPDATE:  DO NOT become a member of this gym!!!  I finally came in to fully cancel my membership, which I had on hold for a while.  They said they needed to look up my account to do so and scanned my card, later telling me actually a manager had to be present so that front desk person I spoke to couldn't actually cancel my account anyway.  Was not able to get a hold of a manager for quite a while, turns out for those 6 weeks they had begun charging me full membership again because scanning my card reactivated my membership!  So then I had to call corporate to refund my card (good luck finding that number, it's very buried), even a gym manager can't fix that kind of mistake and literally said I'd have to speak to corporate.  So front desk staff does not seem to know what can reactivate a membership on hold nor do they have the ability to cancel accounts, which is a hassle because a manager must be present to do so.  So be aware if you sign up here it will be damn near impossible to cancel or adjust any false charges.  I fully expect they'll continue to try to charge me even though they swear I'm cancelled, in which case screw them, they can take it up with my credit card company because I'll refute the charges.",

  "text": "They TRIPLE CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD!  I made a large over $200 purchase and the sales clerk told me I could get 10% off with a coupon that she sent to me by text.  My cell phone has no data plan, so she told me to go to a wifi spot and download the coupon, then bring the coupon code back to the store.  They could then issue me a credit to my credit card for 10%, which was going to mean a credit for about $26.  I said sure!  Came back next day with coupon code and downloaded coupon, but of course there was a different sales clerk on duty who didn't know how to issue me the credit.  She called the store manager over, who also didn't know what he was doing.  The clerk had to enter each of my many items back into the system, as if I was returning them (I wasn't).  But what ended up happening was my credit card was charged again for the same amount.  The third time happened, when she figured out how to get 10% off for each of my purchases, then that grand total hit my credit card.  They told me to contact my bank and do chargebacks.  But the triple charge blew their mind.  They issued me credit for the second amount because it matched the original, but they have to 'investigate' the corrected amount before they will credit the second charge and it will take 30 days.  I've spoken to so many bank people, including ones who barely spoke English!  WARNING: IF YOU HAVE TO RETURN SOMETHING FOR CREDIT, OR IF YOU HAVE A COUPON, BE VERY CAREFUL!  THESE PEOPLE AND THE 'MANAGER' (Mr. Emmit) DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING! Not only has THEIR ERROR tied up my credit line, but I'm probably taking a hit on my credit score too, as it looks like I made 3 large purchases, when I only made one.",

  "text": "What follows is a review of the 15 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Enterprise Rent-A-Car branch not the company as a whole.  So take it with a grain of salt if you are using another branch.\n\nWorst experience with Enterprise I've ever had.  I'd suggest you rent a car at the airport location for staff that \"treat customers the way they should be treated.\"  What follows is my very long story, but I hope it saves some of you from similar experiences.\n\nMy story is marked with periods of incompetence and scattered bits of dishonesty.  I rented a mini van for a trip with grandma and the kids to Florida.  The rental bit went fairly smoothly, but while I was driving down 95 in Florida a motorist's tire kicked up a stone and chipped the windshield.  Ironically, Enterprise made a followup call on my rental not more than 30 minutes after. He asked if there were any problems with the rental. I told him that I just got a chip in the windshield from a motorist and asked if it would be a problem.  He assured me, \"No that won't be a problem.\" I guess I should've asked if I'd be charged for the repair instead.  When I returned the vehicle they thanked me for pointing out the damage and said that I'd forfeit my $150 deposit because I returned the car damaged.\n\nThey explained that they'd have to have their vendor (Safelite Auto Glass) come out and determine whether they'd need to fix or replace the glass.  Some weeks passed and NO ONE called me to give me any details about the incident. No one called to let me know that Safelite had come out and repaired or replaced the glass.  No one called to let me know if I would receive all or part of my deposit back.\n\nThey treated me as if I was just a number, not a person.  There was no communication.  Even after calling and talking with several staff members who always seemed clueless to my situation (as if it was the first they heard of it).  When I had asked for the manager to call me back. I never received a phone call.  \n\nFast forward 4 weeks. I received an email stating that I had incurred a parking violation 5 hours after I returned the car.  \n\nAfter several more phone calls and some attention to detail I learned that they incorrectly marked that I returned the vehicle about a half hour after they closed on the day I returned the rental.  In one of my more than a dozen calls I made I asked for the employee to find out when exactly I had returned the vehicle and she said that she couldn't determine exactly but it looked like it was late morning.  She assured me that she could not update my receipt or rental agreement with the correct time.\n\nShe also said that her station would have to contact the citations department to accept responsibility for the ticket and she assured me that I would not be charged for it.\n\nFast forward to today. Charge in the full amount of the parking ticket appears on my banking statement. I call the branch they say i need to talk to the citations department.  I call the citations department and they say THE BRANCH needs to call THEM.  I asked the person if they have a note or any information from the branch about this citation.  She says they don't.  So when they assured me they would contact the citations department they were either lying or incompetent.  Both are serious offenses toward \"treating the customer as they should be treated\".\n\nMy bank has the best solution. File a dispute for the charge and card will be deactivated and new card issued. Unfortunately that's a bit of an inconvenience, but its the best solution that's been presented.\n\nMy experience with Enterprise on the whole has been very positive, but this branch was the best bad example of incompetence and poor customer service I've ever experienced (even outside the car rental field).  \n\nI'd suggest you rent your vehicle from any branch that's convenient to you except if it's this branch then I'd suggest you go out of your way to avoid this branch.\n\nAfter calling the citations department and getting the District Manager's number I was able to get some resolutions. She was extremely helpful and very apologetic.  \n\nShe explained that my citation was refunded the previous day (and posted to my account that day) and refunded me my deposit and told them that I didn't owe Enterprise for any damages.\n\n\nJust when I breathed a sigh of relief after a month I was sent a bill for $108 and change for windshield repair services.\n\nMy fiancé says to just pay it, but I feel that since the district manager assured me I don't owe Enterprise anything I'll use my time to waste theirs fighting it on principal alone.",

They sounded flustered and told me to pick it up but wouldn't say what was wrong. I went up and a tech in the back who rudely said\"I know you're a woman so you don't understand any of this\" which may be true, but still rude, explained I had an O2 sensor out and some other sensors out. He said it could be up to a grand. Luckily, I still have warranty on my car so I went to my dealership where I should have gone in the first place and they said only the spark plugs were out and an easy fix which was covered. Just annoyed I wasted so much time and was given false information. Definitely don't go to sketchy car places next to a taco bell",

  "text": "While I enjoyed my ramen quality wise I was quite disappointing at the service. My only time having come here I was hopeful as I had heard nothing but amazing opinions. Unfortunately for me while I left with a smile I'm still not ready to make it a point to return. \n\nI was not feeling well and really wanted some ramen. I had not been here yet & decided to call in an order. The girl on the phone was nice also helpful. When I arrived just over 10 minutes past my phone call order, leaving my toddler and fiancee in the car to wait, only because this should not take to long right? Wrong. There was 3-4 tables total in the entire establishment with people seated. I stood in open view at the front desk where you would assume a hostess would be. No one greeted me. The bartender even looked at me several times and said nothing. Finally I assumed \"Ok, maybe this is a seat yourself type of place?\". I then walked up to the bartender and asked him where I would pick up a togo order? His reply was \"Oh, right here\". This after several minutes of being looked at standing at the front was quite irritating. I suppose it doesn't make sense that if he was the person in charge to be serving the tables & doing togo, and not slammed busy (which I would have totally understood if that was the case and felt bad for him) would not even greet me nor ask if I could be helped. I waited another 5ish minutes for my order. Paid my bill and left pretty disgruntled to be honest. Hoping others don't have the same issue.",

  "text": "Lackluster experience here that left me cold.  Saw a doctor on first visit who spent only a couple of minutes with me and didn't go into any real discussion of my issue which is causing considerable pain and lack of mobility.  He recommended a follow up appointment in a few weeks and when I went in for that I saw an associate who recommended a very different procedure than first doctor or my chiropractor had been speaking of.  I relayed this experience to my chiropractor who'd recommended this practice and asked for them to explain the vast difference in opinions.  To date nobody from this practice has contacted me to discuss how I essentially wasted months and received no treatment or relief.  Patients may want to be wary of them.  My insurance got billed for two visits and I got nothing but aggravation from them.\n\nMy overall impression of this practice is that the patient is merely a cog in the works and no care or time is spent with them as they hurry to get to the next appointment so they can bill more.  The receptionist has blue and pink hair.  The office is in a rather run down area outside of Dover DE.  I have since spoken to a few other people who have not had the best experience there and, like me, have decided to seek another opinion / practice.  Others may have had a different experience with this practice but sadly I have nothing good to relate about them.",
