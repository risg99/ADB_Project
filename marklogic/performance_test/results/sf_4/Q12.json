(The huge star in the middle of the menu can be quite distracting!). If you need a good sushi lunch place, then get the lunch special. They have an awesome deal at 3 rolls for $12, which includes either soup or salad. Guess how many choices of rolls you get to choose from? 43!!! Lots of choices to choose from, and I really digged the Pepper Tuna roll and the Alaskan roll. I had the crabmeat apple roll, but didn't care much for it.\n\nMore reasons to love this place: Service is fast and friendly, and they have LOW-sodium soy sauce. \n\nMy challenge is to try different rolls/dishes each time I go there, except the California roll. :)",

We decided to try again the next day for lunch and was able to order a shrimp poboy.\n\nIt took them about 20-30 minutes to make 10 orders of shrimp poboys, but that meant it was a perfect time to grab a frozen irish coffee from the bar. \n\nThe shrimp poboys reminded me of vietnamese sandwiches. Same type of bread with lots of veggies, but the key ingredient is the fresh shrimp. Every time I've had shrimp poboys, the shrimp has always been fried, but this time I was pleasantly surprised to see the shrimp without batter. \n\nThe sandwich was quite delicious although quite expensive at $14.",

  "text": "This is like a Denny's, in that they offer a huge variety of foods, but in no other way - it is one hundred times better than a Denny's. When you walk in you see a wall of cheesecake and you pretty much know it is going to be a fun experience. We were fortunately seated near the HDTV at the back of the restaurant as we watched the Jets fail their faces off against the Steelers - that part sucked, but even that sucking moment was still fun since we were hanging out at the diner. We were in a big group and we also were sitting right next to another big group, the Duke University fencing team. This place draws big groups in because it has a legit reputation among everyone, locals and those from far away who had a great meal here once a long long time ago.\n\nThe big guy (4u) waiter right off the bat was friendly, gracious, and funny - top notch staff here for sure. The water was not exactly refilled at a regular pace but I guess it was pretty busy. It was really hard to choose a dinner since everything sounded so good. I finally settled on the open faced Monte Cristo, longing for 'ye olden days when that deliciousness of the Monte Cristo used to be available at Bennigan's before their shenanigans shuttered their doors across the country. Penrose does not make 'yo daddy's Monte Cristo and that is not an entirely bad thing.\n\nThis is french toast as the base, two pieces and very moist and eggy. Not fried like Bennigan's. Just french toast that is AWESOME. Then meat piled on top of the french toast. Then some cheese on top of that. And a big helping of fries. The fries were solid, the good diner kind, not the shoe string or crinkle cut or that other junk places try to pass off.\n\nI will be back for more Penrose.",

That being said, this is probably one of the nicest Winn Dixies I've ever been to. It's always clean, it's a large store, it's right next to a basketball court and art studio, and it's down the street from my gym. The parking lot is also more shaded than most are due to the trees. So I guess if you're going to get ripped off at a Winn Dixie, get ripped off at this one.",

  "text": "OK I don't understand why the star ratings so far are so bad if everyone is saying they really liked the food. Maybe the ratings are from competitors?\n\nSo here is the REAL blow-by-blow breakdown of this place.\n\nYES it is mobbed. That's because there is a HUGE HUGE HUGE pent-up demand for fast casual Mexican in Tampa, and people are flocking there. After all, let us review our options for fast Mexican food in Tampa Bay: \n\n1. Chipotle = Sodium-filled food, pre-cooked and later boiled in plastic bags. A digestive nightmare.\n\n2. Tijuana Flats/Moe's = Can't really tell the difference between these crapholes; \nboth are substandard Mex joints that would go out of business in California, Texas, etc.\n\n3. Taco Bus = Tasteless food served in cardboard tortillas in a dirty restaurant.YUM!\n\n\nBut back to Lime Fresh:\n\nDo not just show up. Place your order online before you head over there. When you get there, go to the back of the restaurant where the takeout cashier is. Pay for your food there, take it to a table, and eat. This took me 5 minutes. And watch everyone else wait in line for 30 minutes. I had the chicken soft tacos and my friend had the chicken cobb salad. Both were good. Both tasted fresher than any food at the above-mentioned places.\n \nLime Fresh is not the same as Moe's, Tijuana Flats or Chipotle. It is much much better. Is it the best Mexican food you have ever had? NO. Is it authentic Mexican, Cal-Mex, Tex-Mex, etc.? NO. Is it better than the fast food Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, California, etc.? NO. But is it better than Chipotle, Tijuana Flats, etc.?\nYES!!!!!!!\n\nThe ingredients here are much fresher than at Chipotle and Tijuana Flats, you can taste it. (Well, let's face it, the food from Chipotle comes already cooked in plastic bags, which they later boil.) The execution with some of the meats at Lime Fresh is not there yet, but I am hopeful they will get better with that.\n\nThis place is automatically better than the above mentioned places JUST for the extensive salsa bar, which is standard in Cali, Ariz, Texas, etc. but most no one else in Tampa has. And the pico de gallo is pretty decent, as are the other salsas. The menu is extensive, the dining space is nice and huge, the online order process was seamless.\n\nI would def. go back when it's off-peak hours.",

However, whenever I am heading home from Costco and cutting down Loughborough to Hampton, I stop by for items I just cannot buy in bulk at the warehouse store for a single man. \n\nIn my original review, which is now several years old, I complained about the produce department. Wow, things have really changed. I will now say this is one of the better produce departments in STL. It's always fresh, organized and well stocked.\n\nI've also gotten use to the lay-out and can shop the aisles with ease. Another area that is pretty good, is the butcher counter. Give me those pork steaks for that backyard grilling. \n\nThe staff has done a full Three-Sixty on their attitudes. Even during this pandemic when everyone seems to be on the edge, they were upbeat and positive.\n\nWhile shopping during the COVID pandemic, I felt safe with all the safety precautions this store had in place. \n\nWill I return? - For, sure. \n\nWhen: June 4, 2020\nWhy: Grocery items I cannot buy in bulk.",

She showed us some parts of New Orleans destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Gave us her perspective of what life was like before and after the disaster. Learned a lot from here.\n\nThe tour was great. Our swamp boat driver was great. Saw many alligators, and he got them to come really close too, enough for one to jump and ram its body into the side of our boat to reach the sausage/chicken he was feeding them. He was also interacting with the people on the boat, trying to get to know us, too!\n\nDriver back was good, too,\n\nDefinitely a great tour. I highly recommend!",

More often than not Ritz East, Ritz at the Bourse and Ritz 5 are ALL featuring films on my \"wanna see\" list.\n\nI love independent films the most. I love foreign films and art joints. Here's where you find em in Filmadelphia (I'm the worst). Ritz East is well-maintained, clean and comfortable. I am a fan.\n\n I love going to see films and then being able to ramble incessantly with friends willing or otherwise about what we've seen. Judging by the thin-lipped smiles and glazed over expressions on their faces, I'm sure that I take it to an insufferable level; as is my way. Maybe it's just that I keep repeating the word, \"film,\" over and over. I really geek over this stuff. \n\nOne of my favorite things in Philly life is to hatch a plan where we go catch what's playing at one of the Ritzes, then go for a drink/meal/bite along our walking way to another nearby Ritz, another movie. \n\nHow bout a movie-meal crawl?

The selection of yogurt flavours was decent, and I combined plain with chocolate and raspberry. The chocolate was not all that rich, but the other two flavours were good. I think the selection of toppings is the biggest of all of the different fro-yo places I have tried. They even line the wall. Most of the cereals are in hanging containers that you have to release with a lever, and the stuff comes out FAST! I would prefer everything just be in bins to scoop out, because I ended up with far more Lucky Charms than I intended. The fruit looked fresh, and there was lots of candies and nuts. I only wish everything was labelled. Price-wise Twisted Yogurt is comparable with other fro-yo chains, and I wish it was not so out of my way to visit more often.",

I hadn't left the lane and just turned to her and said \"I gave you a twenty\" (it was even on the receipt).  She apologized and said she thought she gave the correct change.  She couldn't open her drawer because she rang the next person up.  \n\nBut funny thing, when she handed me my ten, she wouldn't look me in the eye....\n\nSo I'm just going to say, BEWARE...count your change if you pay cash or use a credit card!",

There was a 3 for $4 taco deal* I was going to take advantage of and papusas are always a good idea. I ordered... and waited. In the time I waited, the tables weren't bused, a woman came in with a slightly unruly child to pick up a take out order, the TV showed various barely clothed men and women writhing about Miami Beach, and an older man entered sat down, got annoyed at the wait time, waved his hands, banged on the table and shouted 'Estoy aqui!' I just sat there. After more waiting (and more TV jiggling) my order was finally ready. When I got up to pay for it, the woman put her hands together and thanked me for my patience. My annoyance melted away then and there. Chismes is a small space, packed with seating. She was, obviously, in the weeds and doing several jobs at once. Sometimes all the mierda hits the fan at once. She acknowledged it and thanked me. Done. I wasn't going to belabor her agony. Besides, my food smelled great.\n\nI got home and tore into my tacos. Ridiculous. So so good. Seasoned, shredded meat, cilantro and onion never tasted so good. Add in fresh lime and Chismes' thick, green hot sauce and you have a party. The papusa came with curtido (good). The texture/consistency of the papusa was a bit tough and off-putting but I don't know if that's because I ordered a Salvadoran dish at a Mexican place. It wasn't terrible but didn't top the papusas at my local fave Salvadoran spot. The curtido didn't have the vinegar-y kick I was looking for, so I just added some green sauce and kept it moving. For as tough as the papusa was, the inner beans and cheese were very good. I'd return to Chismes but I am sticking to getting my food to go. \n\n*Seriously: why do you pay so much for tacos. You know you're ripping yourself off, right?",

But when you do, make sure it's Cajun Encounters Tour Company. \n\nThere's something to be said for the brave folks that tour the bayou in early August. When humidity and the ambient temperature are about the same there's only so much you can do. But making the most of the experience with a smile and good attitude will never do you wrong. \n\nI spent a good month researching all the things to do on our NOLA bday trip. Every day we filled it with things to do, places to be, and foods to eat. After much research I found Cajun Encounters was an absolute necessity. \n\nFirst, know that the bayou isn't anywhere near NOLA. You'll board a nice bus that will transport you about 40 minutes north/north-east of NOLA to the bayou. From there you'll wait some more. By the time you return to your hotel it will be well into the late afternoon. So expect that this will take a good chunk of your day. \n\nWith that said, make time for this experience. I can't guarantee you'll have a similar experience to ours as every guide is unique in their presentation. But it'll be fun for sure. \n\nI was super pleased with our tour guide (his name escapes me) but he was a retired conservation officer. His tour was fantastic - we learned about the flora, fauna and all kinds of conservation efforts. No cheap photo ops with hot dogs on a stick here. I appreciated his natural approach to the tour! We saw plenty of gators in their natural habitat which (trust me) was more than enjoyable. \n\nThe only thing that could have made this experience even better was if they didn't cram so many folks into the boats. We had several large people and packing 20-something guests into these tin cans (shoulder-to-shoulder) meant very little air-flow. And of course, very little opportunity to social distance. I would have paid double for half the number of people. \n\nDefinitely take the weather into account. Bring your camera. And enjoy!",

It's also very roomy with outdoor seating.\n\nMy husband got a cup of chocolate ice cream to share with our sons and I tried a caramel shake.  Upon his first bite, my husband was amazed at how chocolate-y his chocolate ice cream tasted.  It was very rich and creamy. My shake was a little too rich, not that it's a bad thing.  I was just full from dinner.  It could have used a little more caramel in it because it was mixed with vanilla bean ice cream that was as vanilla bean-y as my husband's chocolate ice cream was chocolate-y and overwhelmed the caramel.  \n\nI find it sadly amusing that another reviewer said the flavors were off.  It's made from natural ingredients. Some people are so used to the synthetic stuff, they don't know what real food tastes like.The ice cream is higher in price due to the quality of ingredients but on par with chains like Ben & Jerry's.  It's very rich and filling so you definitely get your money's worth.\n\nI also took some gourmet chocolate home: a Bailey's Irish cream truffle, a Kahlua and cream truffle, a French chocolate velvet, a butterscotch velvet and a salted milk chocolate caramel. Everything was great.\n\nThe shop also carries Ty's line of beanie boos and plush animals to peruse while you wait for your order.",

I live in Phoenix now and the choices for good Indian food are very limited, so whenever I'm back in town I make sure my mom and I go for a dinner. We went on a Wednesday and it turned out to be buffet night, which is perfect since we can get to try out new dishes. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala: excellent, one of the best I've had\nLamb Kadhai: very good, tender juicy lamb\nVegetable and Potli Samosas: awesome\nNavratan Korma: a new vegetable dish for me. loved it, blown away by it even.\nKashmiri Dum Aloo: potatoes filled with cheese in a cream sauce. You don't even have to ask if  these are amazing. you already know they are.\nMutter Panir: really good\nDaal Makhani: black beans and lentils in cream, I recommend if eating from buffet.\n\nDelicious, served hot Garlic Naan.\n\nThis tip may make you feel like an old person, but go a little early, like around 5:30-6pm.  The first round of buffet items are brought out around then for dinner, so you know they are fresh and untouched. \n\nI don't typically get dessert at an Indian restaurant, but since they offer it in the buffet I figured I'd give it a shot. I liked the Gulab Jaman (milk and cheese balls dipped in syrup), but not a must have next time. The rice pudding was ok, a little too runny for my liking.  \n\nOverall, one of my all time favorite Indian restaurants and one of my all time favorite south NJ restaurants.",

So I'm equal opportunity, if not the shame of my city. \n\nBlack Thorn was advertised to me as \"the best pizza in St. Louis,\" and while it's a whole lot better than Imo's (Good lord, is anything worse than Imo's?) I think there's still room for something better. No, I don't know what it is? But I don't think Black Thorn is unimpeachable at the top. \n\nYes, the place is a dive - as a friend said, there might be some \"deferred maintenance.\" But it didn't reek of smoke too badly, so I have no problem with it. Our pizza was a green pepper and mushroom, with a side of garlic bread - absolutely plenty to serve three people, probably could have served 5, really. The pizza itself isn't as much thick crust as it is stuffed - the pie was ordered on my behalf by the friends I was with, so maybe I missed something, but I wouldn't consider this to be exactly like the Malnati's/Giordano's/Gino's East thick crust pizza, but more like thin crusts with cheese and toppings in between, then more cheese and toppings on top. Not a lot of sauce - we got a \"side\" of sauce, which was literally just cold red sauce, and awfully sweet red sauce at that. Might have been better warm, but it didn't add much. The pizza was solid. Nothing bad here, worth going back. But maybe over-hyped for me. \n\nWorth mentioning that we went on a Saturday, and it was not that packed...there was easy nearby street parking, and we got a table within minutes, but I believe the order was called in about 45 minutes before we arrived, and we waited for maybe 15-20 minutes after we showed up before our order came out.

Such was my recent experience at The Prime Rib.\n\nI have struggled a bit in coming up with an adjective to describe the ambience. I've settled on \"cool elegance\" based on the combination of soft piano music (the grand piano has a clear cover - really cool), dark woods, mirrors, leopard print carpet, large floral booths, and huge floral displays in beautiful large vases. I felt in a way like I was stepping back in time, wondering if Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra ever dined in an atmosphere like this. Table settings were simple - white tablecloths, small plate, appropriate crystal - very nice.\n\nService was impeccable as well, as servers were attentive but not hovering. They know their menu and offer great insight into the wine selections as well. There were four of us, and I was the only red wine drinker of the group so I opted for a Malbec by the glass. I was pleased with the \"by the glass\" selection, by the way - something that many restaurants seem to ignore.\n\nMy fare for the evening began with escargots - tender and tasty snails with mushroom caps in a wonderful garlic butter - easily some of the best I've ever enjoyed. My signature cut Prime Rib was a perfect medium rare and was accompanied by freshly grated horseradish. Sides for our table included steak fries, brussels sprouts, and sautéed spinach with garlic. All were delicious (I'm taking my boss's word on the brussels sprouts - I just can't go there).\n\nSuccinctly stated, this is why I so enjoy fine dining. And I can't wait to return.",

It is not at all surprising that Sears/Kmart are in big trouble financially.  The shopping center is confusing and could really use a few stop signs here and there to improve traffic flows and safety.  The store is disorganized and not well lit.  You often find an item with no price tag anywhere.  Was it suppose to be here or was this lonely object randomly placed here by employees or shoppers?  Who knows?  There are a lot of stuff on shelves/racks in the middle of the aisles. There is no logic in how the items are organized.   Its like a thrift shop, the dollar store, or a garage sale.   The lines are long and the cashiers move like molasses.  Just think of the efficiency you see at Costco, and now picture the exact opposite happening at Kmart.  \n\nThe so call shop your way reward system is just more trouble than it is worth.  If you have credit in the account, It is not automatically credited toward your purchase.  You have to ask everytime and you have to input a pin number just to use it.  Anyone remember that?  I don't think so since no sane individual would regularly subject herself to the Kmart shopping experience.  \n\nOnce, I even had a cashier who specifically ask me if I want to know how much is in my rewards account.  She then looked it up and told me the number, something like 15 cents.  When I looked at my receipt later, the credit was not applied to my purchase.  Well, why the hell did you go through all that trouble if it is not going toward my purchase?  Oh yeah, she would need the stupid pin number to use it.  Along with the question of \"would you like me to see how much is in your account?\", this particularly friendly cashier also had a repertoire of other questionnaires.  \"Would you like the receipt printed or emailed?\", \"Would you like just the receipt or the receipt with all the coupons?\", \"Would you like to donate to St. Jude?\", \"Would you like to apply for a credit card?\", \"Would you like this in a bag?\"...Gahh, maybe that's why the line moves like molasses.",

It was served with a grilled scallop small appetizer as well as a salad.  The price was $50 and it was definitely enough for my son and me to share.  The bread was fresh and accompanied by a delicious butter as well as crab spread.  This location does offer Happy Hour, but only for patrons that sit in the bar.  If I return to this city, I'd love to visit this Fleming's location again.  Great job, Fleming's!",

  "text": "After hearing about the newest ice cream shop in our area, Lickety Splitz, I couldn't wait to give it a try. My first time here (definitely not my last) was on a Wednesday night around 8 PM. Lickety Splitz is connected to Laurel Lanes Bowling. \n\nLickety Splitz offers a variety of flavors - both sweet and sinful. The difference? Sinful is alcohol infused. Who knew  you could make ice cream even MORE fun? All the ice cream is handcrafted and totally delicious. A full flavor list is displayed on site and online. \n\nBy checking out their website, you can also see the current specials they're running - in June they ran half off ice cream flights. \n\nSpeaking of ice cream flights - they're awesome! You get the option to try 4 flavors in 2 ounce cups. Of course, this is what I opted for. I tried the red velvet, chocolate, birthday cake and smores. Each thick and creamy, but smores was my favorite. The Smores was filled with crushed gram-crackers and stuffed with mini marshmallows. \n\nThere is a small seating section in front of the ordering window, and additional seating at the Splitz Bar & Grill which you're welcome to sit at. \n\nThe staff all wore masks and gloves, and wiped down tables and high touch points when tables turned over. The staff was friendly. \n\nIf you're craving ice cream, give Lickety Splitz a try!",

Vibe is kinda icy too - with colored LEDlights that change color and rock-hard banquettes that are straight up & down and not that comfortable to sit at.  Water was brought instantly (YAY!) and green tea (which I had to ask for) was free.\n\nI ordered a yellowtail scallion roll (had decent yellowtail but hardly any scallion in it) and a roll with salmon and grilled onions (loaded with mayo blobs on top which I scraped off - seriously, at least 3-4 tsp. of mayo.  Eew).  It was also supposed to have masago but there was NOE in there - and when I asked the (sweet) girl about it she said they don;t include masago on the lunch special.\n\nThese people are certainly cost consious - as the lettuce & dressing salad indicated (no tomato, no nothin').\n\nI am in absolutely NO HURRY to come back here - yet - oddly enough - I ran into a friend here with another aquaintance and the LOVE it here.\n\nMeh. Meh. Meeeeeeh.\n\nSorry.\n\nDoma and Vics cost more - but are sooooo much better.\n\nNope.",

When I replied yes, she asked if she could tell me what the have to offer. Why of course!\n\nSo they offer pretzel crusted chicken tenders, dark meat and white meat, spicy vs mild. They also have some sweets that I didn't indulge in (but baked on premises!) I also got their mac and cheese, and jalapeno corn bread. \nSo the way they price things here is based on weight. And if i remember correctly it's either $7.50 or $8.95/pound I can't remember.. I'll update when I check! \nBut as you can see, it's kind of pricey. For my chicken,  cornbread and mac n cheese it came to $15.46 (and I got 5 pieces of chicken tenders). \n\nI'll give it to them for the mac n cheese. It was awesome flavorful, with a good crust on the top!  The chicken was A-OK. It was decently juicy, but not very flavorful! Kind of bland.  But the crust was nice and crispy! They also have a handful of dipping flavors for 50 cents a piece. I opted for the pesto parmasean which was super awesome. \nThe cornbread was pretty good. A ltitle on the dry side, but I really appreciated the amount of jalapenos in there! I love jalapenos :)\n\nI'm not sure I'd be back just due to the pricey-ness and OK value of food. Maybe if I'm in the area :)",

They were packed as it had just recently opened.  We grabbed cocktails at the bar while we waited about 20 min for our table.  Apparently they had just gotten their liquor license that day so the bar wasn't fully set up and it was rather chaotic.  This is very much a chain restaurant trying to set a vibe with their kitschy decor.\n\nWe ordered hush puppies and fried calamari right away.  The food came out quickly and the hush puppies were delicious but we would not order the calamari again.  Half of our table ordered their food cajun style while the other half opted for butter & garlic.  I will definitely say that the cajun fans enjoyed their food a lot more.  My husband ordered the Reel's Catch ($46) with lobster tails, crawfish, and clams.  I ordered the make your own combo ($27) and got 1 lb of snow crab legs.  We shared our food and both agreed that we would never order the crawfish again.  The food was okay but everything tastes the same and it is very messy.  We may go back down the road to see if it has improved but I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.",

  "text": "We were EXTREMELY excited to join the Plantation and Swamp Tours. We chose Cajun Encounters because of the raving reviews as well as the lowest price for a combo tour 2 Plantation + swamp tour and we could do the tours in different days.\n\nWe took the Plantation Tour first.. it was fun and low key.. Stacey, our driver, was a local NOLA and she seemed to LOVE her job. She was really informative.. she kept us entertained during our 50 minutes bus ride to Laura Plantation. I will review the plantations separately.\n\nWe did feel a bit ripped off realizing that each plantation actually only charges $18/person ..so the $70 price tag for the 2 plantation tours + pick up service.. seemed a bit overpriced.\n\nHowever, Stacey was GREAT, we requested her to drop us of at Central Grocery after the tour instead of our hotel and she oblige. She even showed us Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's house at the French Quarter.\n\nThe next day... we took the Swamp tour.. and our driver (he didn't introduce himself, don't know his name) WAS HORRIBLE! He was on the phone constantly and he didn't navigate or give us any story about NOLA at all.. the 50 minutes bus ride was so boring!\n\nThen, we went on the swamp tour.... our tour guide was friendly and nice HOWEVER he obviously didn't have enough experience to be a swamp tour guide! He's just a local young man who is likes to talk and talk and talk. When I joined a swamp tour..I wanted to see and know about the swamp. I don't care about American Idol or any hollywood actors and actresses and I can watch E! or ET to get updated of how screw up they could be. I don't need my swamp tour guide to ramble about hollywood all trip long!\n\nIt was not the season.. we didn't see lots of gators like what people claimed. We only saw one tiny gator and the tour guide failed to entertain the gator with marshmallow and he also didn't stay long enough to allow us to watch the gator. Then he enjoyed talking about hollywood so much that the boat got stuck between the trees.\n\nThe only thing I enjoyed from the swamp tour was feeling the breeze when the tour guide speed up the boat! Also.. our boat didn't have a cover and hello it was 12PM, 90 degrees and on an open swamp and we were there for about 2 hours!\n\nAfter the boring tour.. we were all hungry and tired and HOT... but we had to wait for 45 minutes because the bus was LATE. The bus was FULL and the only empty seats were at the back of the bus..that's ok EXCEPT..,the A/C was LEAKING to the BACK SEATS so the seats were all drenched and my bf and another tourist had to experience water dripping to their shoulders during the trip back to our hotel.\n\nFor about $50/person... the swamp tour certainly failed to impress ..what a rip off!",

The hostess took me upstairs, where I sat at the bar and was haphazardly served by the bartender up there. \n\nI got a cup of Mexican chicken tortilla soup and the Moroccan salmon salad and it was all delicious! The salad had a nice sized cut of salmon, cranberries, couscous, spinach and a light dressing. \n\nI don't recommend sitting at the bar otherwise, as I have a pretty high tolerance for bad service and this one was about to break me. Maybe their computers were down or maybe this is the way the servers order drinks, but every five minutes there was a server barking out their drink orders to a frazzled bartender who never got around to filling up my water or even checking on me for that matter. \n\nObviously, I could have spoken up if I was dying of thirst, but that's not the point. There were couples flanking me who waited 30 minutes just to put their food order in because she was too busy to take their drink AND food orders?

  "text": "Since moving from Korean food heaven (aka. Los Angeles) to Philly a few months ago, I've tried over a few dozen Korean restaurants and I've been fairly disappointed in every single one of them. All of them had ok to terrible tasting Korean food and they were all overpriced for the quality that they served. I was about to give up on all Korean food in the East Coast and write it up as a hopeless endeavor.\n\nAnd that all changed when I came here.\n\nI was told about Jong Ka Jib by a friend who knew I was looking for good soon doo bu and how I'd been so disappointed in all of the Korean places around the area. I honestly didn't think this place would be any different but I was thinking, \"Hey, at this point, I might as well start conditioning my mind into thinking this is good Korean food.\" and I went.\n\nI was blown away. Not only is Jong Ka Jib the best Korean food I've had at a restaurant since moving out from LA, but I would definitely consider it one of the top ten soon doo bu places I've ever been to in my life. Granted, it's not in the top 3 in my opinion but it's definitely up there. I had the pork soon doo bu extra spicy and ordered a side of kalbi ($15). The soup base was very tasty and it wasn't too watery or thick. And the tofu was cooked to perfection. They give out perfect portions too so after you finish eating, you should be pretty full.\n\nDon't be surprised or put-off when you come in and see a ton of non-Koreans eating here (white and Chinese) if you're not used to that. I myself, coming from LA, if I went to a Korean place and saw the customer base were mostly non-Koreans, I walked out because from experience, the food did not taste like Korean food but very Americanized. This place doesn't follow that trend.\n\nThe service here is just ok, or maybe even below ok but that's what I've come to expect and experience when I was in LA going to good Korean restaurants. It's rare to find a Korean place that has great service and great food. The galbi was terrible though. Don't get it. First off, it's not marinated very well and the flavors come across a bit funky. Second, it is way overpriced for the amount and quality of the meat. I shared the kalbi with two other people and we didn't even finish the galbi. That's how bad it was. As long as you stick with the soondoobu, and the occasional pajun (Korean pancake), you'll be very happy.\n\nAfter my oh so amazing experience here, I came here two more time thinking maybe it was a fluke. And no, it wasn't. I think I've found my home here.\n\nParking: Limited lot or street\nPrice: $10 per person\nWait: 10 mins after order (during rush hour you will wait an hour to be seated so beware)",

My friend had a kids' meal that was actually just right-sized for any normal adult. In fact, the only real qualm here is the portion size and calorie count, both of which are really too much for regularly consuming, unless, I guess, you live in Wisconsin and need to stay warm.\nSome of the desserts look mighty tempting, such as something they call a Concrete Mixer, which is a takeoff on the Dairy Queen Blizzard, featuring a ton of mix-ins.\nThe kids' meal even came with a scoop of the signature frozen custard, a creamy treat somewhere between gelato and soft serve.",

If you haven't tried their food, then let me halps you from that rock you's living under.\n\nSo I'm not gonna review the food like I would every other restaurant.\n\nI had to wait a little longer (\"Just pull over to that big shake sign and it will be out nice and fresh for you in about four and a half minutes!\") but I didn't even care that it was actually more than four and a half minutes because it was certainly fresh, and delicious. And the kid at the window was super bubbly. I like bubbly at 3 in the morning. It just makes me enjoy life. It's like, why NOT be friendly and corny just because it's at an incredibly strange and somewhat dangerous hour here at Kingshighway and Chippewa? Life's too short to be crabby!\n\nI don't even really like Steak 'n' Shake....I only went here because McDonalds pissed me off a lotta bit....but I'll probably be back when I need my occasional dose of night shifter weight gain.",

  "text": "Zeppoli is definitely my favorite place for dinner in Collingswood. This is a small intimate place for a quality dinner.... and it's BYOB. Major downer for myself it's not on the main Haddon strip and it's hard to get an earlier reservation.\n\nAnyways foods amazing, definitely a place we're you want to get a 4 course meal, which is probably about $40-$65 per person if you like to eat. My favorite pasta is the limone pasta, which is citrusically unique. For my entree, everything is great, swordfish, rabbit... but I usually go with the steak $30. It's a very fatty, large  portion which is served medium. \n\nZeppoli is definitely a great place for a special occasion or a special lady.",

The service isn't necessarily exceptional since it's a basic froyo place, but I don't really expect a lot if I'm pouring my own yogurt and putting on my own toppings.\n\nI can't speak to the smoothies, but they've got a wide variety of options for smoothie lovers. They just seemed a little expensive to me.",

  "text": "I don't feel any shame in admitting that this was my first experience with this chain. That is not to say that I was unfamiliar with it, but opted for more \"authentic\" spots when burrito etc. needs arose. After dining here I can better understand their popularity though.\n\nTrish's steak burrito was huge and like everything else here, made to order. I found the beef to be a bit tough and am always turned off when protein is cubed into such consistent pieces. My chicken bowl was perhaps better. The poultry was tender and nicely seasoned with a Tex/ Mex blend. Again another great portion and more suited to a dinner than a lunch. A side of guac was ok, definitely not on par with most Mexican spots.\n\nI would be all in favor of returning if convenience and serving size was my main concern. C's is definitely a good option in comparison with chains that serve similar grub. Maybe even the best option. I prefer to seek out more independent establishments where this type of food is not part of a business plan, but instead the backbone of their food culture. 3.25 still thinking about that whole cilantro fiasco Yelps",

  "text": "This warm and inviting space was exactly what we needed before starting our day each morning at the Don Cesar. Located on the ground level of the beautiful Don Cesar Hotel, this oasis of goodies and coffee is exactly what we needed and when we needed it. When you walk by Uncle Andy's Ice Cream Parlor, you can't help but feel pulled in by the sights of the brightly highlighted coffee and ice cream bar.\n\nOnce inside the shop, you're immediately surrounded by shelves and tables of snacks and goodies. They have just about everything you would need in one spot from breakfast and lunch sandwiches, which they heat up for you upon request, to chocolates, liquor, and snacks. There's definitely something for everyone at Uncle Andy's! \n\nThe folks there are so helpful and accomodating, as they even offer to allow you to place your order with the restaurant next door and take it to go from Uncle Andy's! Right outside the doors of this amazing coffee shop is the courtyard leading to the beach. We carried our breakfast and coffee out toward the beach to the couches, where we enjoyed the sunrise and breakfast with a view. \n\nI highly recommend the Don Cesar, and frequent Andy's Ice Cream Parlor while you're there!",

  "text": "Shots! Shots! Shots! For free!! That is one thing to draw you in at this small local distillery. My friend wanted to do something different and signed us up for their free tour on Sunday. They had two times, 2 pm and 4 pm. The man working that day stated 4pm is usually a slower time, so we could enjoy more.\n\nWhat I liked about this, was they didn't limit the tastings. He literally said \"you can taste through our whole product line if you can handle it\" well I attempted to do so (but didn't)\n\nLet me start off my saying vodka is NOT my drink of choice, but I can get into their vodka! It was really smooth in my opinion, and the flavor wasn't overpowering. Some flavored vodkas taste so syrupy I hate it. This is very clean tasting with a hint of flavor. They also have whisky, gin and moonshine! \n\nMy favorite was the sunrise moonshine. It has a toffee flavor that reminded me of coffee. I bought some!! It's 109 proof :-) I tasted three of their moonshines! Sunset, sunrise, and high noon. \n\nFor Vodka they had candy cane ready to go for the holidays and it was pretty good! Very dangerous as well lol \n\nOthers I tasted were: Miami mango, key west lemon and lime, Orlando orange, Florida fire ant (wait that's almost all hehe). \n\nAs a grand finally, they said they had moonshine infused ice cream!! They top it off with a moonshine shot as you eat it. You can't beat the prices either for the quality and proof.\n\nVodka bottle: $25 moonshine: $30 two coop ice cream: $7 and pint: $14 they also have plane sized bottles for $5!\n\nI will be back!",

  "text": "It's not just dinner, it's an intimate meal and BYOB setting that isn't only for romantics. I would definitely say this is a place to bring your inner circle for great food and conversation. The lighting is dim, the room is small and a reservation is a must. The tea light lit tables aren't fancy and it has plain wooden tables that are generic but done on purpose. Servers (2-3) understand their menu and since they aren't overworked as you would see in a crowded noisy place they are much more in tune with patrons.  \n\nFor starters the complimentary bread is every bit of delicious. The focaccia has a contradictory texture of crispness on top but moist the on the bottom. It is served with olives and an olive oil. Our special appetizer was one of the anchovy starters that was served with roasted red peppers. My husband was a bigger fan of this dish than I was but still, it met my expectations. \n\nDrinks can be BYOB but since it skipped our minds to bring wine we ordered the lemon aid that is for 2 people. It was served in a pitcher and was tangy and less sour than I would have expected. It was refreshing and a pitcher carried us on throughout the course of our meal.\n\nThe salad we had was light: giant juicy red tomatoes, a bread that was soaked with flavor-fulness and cucumber on top of arugula. It was our pre-game before the entree. For our next course, I had the fusilli pasta in a pesto pistachio sauce. My husband had the rabbit with rosemary oven roasted potatoes. The rabbit was moist and it fell off like silk away from the bone. Dessert was three Zeppoli doughnuts and a rich milk chocolate sauce. The inner dough wasn't too dense and had outside crust that was cinnamon-sugary and sweet.",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because it's a shame it took me so long to come here.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nAfter restaurants reopened, I've made a concentrated effort to visit places that I've had bookmarked for years and just never went to for some reason. 1200 Chophouse was the final local bucket list spot to check off. Don't get me wrong, there are still places I want to visit, but I'm talking about only the top, top tier of restaurants that I've really always wanted to check off. Other new places will open, but as of now, I feel like I've pretty much been everywhere. And I saved a good one for \"last\".\n\nThis time around, Anna M made sure to set her alarm properly, so we arrived a few minutes before 5pm on a Saturday when doors open. We were the 2nd people in line, but by 5:00 on the dot, there were several other customers ready to enter. After only a few minutes of being seated, pretty much every table was occupied. We arrived at 5p because I have a young child at home and I wanted to help with bedtime, but I'm glad we came when we did, because otherwise we would have been in quite the wait. When we walked out around 6:30p, there were many people waiting - some sitting on the couches outside near the road.\n\nThis part of my review is not an indictment of 1200 Chophouse - they are simply following the rules. The rules are 10/10 silly. You must have a mask on inside, unless you're seated at the table. The dining room is not large at all - it was about 8-12 feet from the doorway to our table and another 8-12 feet from our table to the bathroom. So we put on our masks, took about 6 steps, sat down at our table and talked/ate/drank for 90 minutes with no mask on - like every other patron. When I got up to the bathroom, I had my mask on for the 6 steps in route to the single person toilet room. Again, mask on for the 6 steps back to the table. And finally, mask on for the 6 steps out the door. At one point, a server asked a man to put his mask on. The man said, \"what about all of these people?\" The server said, \"they are seated and dining. So he literally grabbed the bar chair that was within arms reach and sat down. Standing? Mask needed. Sitting down, 10 inches to the left? No mask necessary. Again - nothing against 1200 Chophouse, they don't want to get shut down. But the rules themselves? It's just good science.\n\nOnto the food...\n\nWe started off with steak frites and bacon wrapped scallops. The scallops were the highlight of the evening. The smokiness of the bacon complemented the bacon perfectly - I wish I could eat these every day. The streak frites were delicious and the sauce was ideal, but the bacon wrapped scallops stole the show.\n\nAnna and I shared the prime bone-in ribeye special and upgraded to oscar style. This worked out well, as they evenly split the plate for us and removed the bone, but still brought it out for us. We both enjoyed the steak very much. The only gripe I had is that oscar style kind of overwhelmed the flavor of each bite and took away from the natural steak flavor. If I were to return, I'd maybe do a traditional surf and turf where the seafood is separated from the steak.\n\nThe bread and honey butter that came with it was amazing and the salads were great too. I opted for a loaded baked potato as my side dish, which came with big clumps of butter and sour cream to add at my leisure. I added. A lot.\n\nI'd definitely love to come back again, especially for future special occasions. This was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in the St. Pete Beach area!",

  "text": "This place was fantastic.\n\nWe went because my husband was craving a burger, and I wanted to try a local, non-chain restaurant.  What a wonderful surprise!\n\nThe best part of the place was the amazing service we received.  Our waiter was constantly checking on us (in a non-obnoxious way) and refilling drinks.  More impressively, the owner came to our table multiple times, remembered our names, and even comped us dessert.\n\nI had the fried pork chop sandwich, and it was wonderful.  I went with the super spicy sauce, which had the right amount of kick for me.  Apparently most people find it too spicy, so even after the waiter insisted that I order the sauce on the side, the owner came out to make sure that I didn't want to switch to the normal spicy sauce.  Whatever.  Oh, the fries were perfectly crisp, and I loved the spices.\n\nMy husband had his cheeseburger, and he enjoyed it.  He had a cup of chili instead of fries, and he said that he'd happily order it again.\n\nAs I mentioned above, dessert was on the house.  The owner insisted that we try the orangesicle cheesecake, which tasted very orange-y and rich.  It was great (if you love oranges -- and I do), but next time, I want to try the neapolitan cheesecake.\n\nThe homemade chips and ranch dip were phenomenally simple yet tasty.  I'd go back to EATS again just for the chips and a beer.  But, of course, then I'd want the cheesecake.  And a fried pork sandwich.  \n\nOh, be forewarned: on Tuesdays, kids eat free, so Tuesdays are crowded with kids.  That might or might not be a positive in your book.",

  "text": "Umami is a newly opened pan-Asian restaurant serving authentic Japanese, Korean and Thai food. I live in Chicago, but I go to Nashville often to visit family and friends (I stayed in Brentwood area), so it was nice timing for me to try out this new restaurant and I got to try a lot of their menu items with our group. They've got a great variety of dishes on their menu, and everything we had was delicious. You can tell that everything is made from scratch here, as well as using fresh, authentic ingredients. Here's my review on each item, in no particular order:\n\nKimchi fries: This is a fun take using a Korean classic (the kimchi) and an American snack (cheese fries). I loved all the flavors and textures on this dish: crispy hot french fries topped with ooey, gooey nacho cheese, sauteed kimchi, scallions, and a white sauce that I can only guess is mayo (or sour cream?). I will try to update this when I find out. \n\nKorean Fried Chicken: One of their more popular items (according to our server). You can select the soy garlic or the spicy sauce, or go half and half with your order (6 pcs, 10 pcs, 20 pcs, 30 pcs). I wanted my son to be able to try it, so I opted for the soy garlic. That did NOT disappoint! It's the perfect blend of that umami flavor that comes from soy sauce paired with the garlic flavor. It comes with a side of pickled radishes that is the perfect complementary crunch with your chicken. This is actually how fried chicken is served in Korea, and it's excellent. No need to travel all the way to Seoul!\n\nTuna poke: this is your classic tuna poke (pronouned poh-kae), which is a salad of raw tuna, cucumber and avocados. There were large chunks of fresh tuna, marinated and seasoned well (not overpowering the tuna or anything). \n\nSpeaking of fresh...can't get any fresher with the sashimi plate! We got a variety of sashimi to share, and I seriously loved every type of fish! If you're adventurous, you can try the freshly fried shrimp head if you order the sweet shrimp sashimi. The kitchen basically deep-fries the actual shrimp head that's taken off the body of the raw shrimp. For some of you, that sounds like something that could be shown on Andrew Zimmern's show, Bizarre Foods. But like he says on his show...if it looks good, eat it!!!!!!! Ahng!!!!! \n\nMango Tango Maki Roll: one of the recommendations from our server -- did not disappoint! I asked for this roll without cream cheese (I just do not prefer to have any cream cheese in any of my rolls) and it was not even an issue (I mention this, because some restaurants don't like to customize the maki roll orders -- \"no substitutes\" policy at those places). I don't think I've ever had a \"sweet\" maki roll before, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavors of this roll. The spicy crab and mango/strawberry actually went really well together. I'm glad that they can be inventive with their maki rolls, as well as serve the usual crowd favorites. \nSide note: I love the fun names of the maki rolls -- ranging from \"Pokemon Go\", \"Music City\", and \"the \"OMG Roll\" (I imagine this one will make you say OMG haha)\n\nKorean Chicken Tacos: You can choose from beef, chicken or pork for the Korean tacos. My son loves chicken, so we just went with the safer option (still delicious). I guess we could have tried the combo, I think that comes with one of each taco, maybe? This is also a very fun take on some classic Korean flavors with a little Mexican twist: the chicken has a Korean marinade, topped with Asian pickled radishes and cilantro, served in a warm corn tortilla.\n\nSeafood Ramen: If you're familiar with and (like me) LOVE the Chinese-Korean noodle dish called \"Jjam-bbong\", then you will equally fall in love with this dish! The noodles are obviously the ramen noodles, but in the spicy seafood broth that is used for the \"jjam-bbong\" dish. I can tell that they use fresh seafood for the broth, because it's spicy and refreshing, not fishy at all! I was actually thinking about this bowl the next day...and how much I wanted to eat it again. The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back to get this dish again!\n\nBeer Selection: They have an AWESOME beer selection, with some local and international beers. I love checking out local beers wherever I go, and the ones I tried were awesome. They also have some great ones on tap. \nFun tip: Order a large pitcher of beer, and it comes out in this REALLY fun pitcher that has dry ice and flashing lights -- so flashing smoke from your pitcher. It's not just for funsies, though...it keeps your beer nice and cold so that every pour is just as refreshing as the first.\n\nI saw a lot of people coming in for pick-up orders, so if you don't have time to sit down in the restaurant, you could always call ahead and pick up on your way home (or wherever you're headed).\n\nOverall, a wonderful meal and experience at Umami. Keep it up, guys! I'll be coming back soon.",

  "text": "After hearing good things from my coworkers and reading some recent Yelp reviews about how pleased the Yelpers were coming to Bareburger, I decided to come here for lunch today with my coworker. We were mostly pleased.\n\nThe first thought upon entry was the bright colors and spaciousness of the place with the booths on one side and tables on the other. The sign directed people to sit where they wanted. After a walk down the movie theatre somewhat sticky floor, we sat near the front of the restaurant. A short wait for our friendly waitress and we got our paper menus. I was very happy to see that a lot of the foods here are organic.  \n\nThe appetizer of the crispy Brussels sprouts was excellent. Perfectly fried with no grease and the Asiago cheese with scallions and lemon wedges really upped the anti. I had to save room so I took half home with me as my coworker is not a foodie like me and also not adventurous to even try except for the piece of cheese that was calling her name. She liked it!\n\nFor my burger, I chose to go the \"build your own\" route but they do have plenty of other options. Bison burger on lettuce with crisped onions, sweet pickles, tomato, spinach, pepper jack cheese, and sriracha sauce. Medium rare. My coworker went with the beef on Brioche and organic cheddar, with a spicy chipotle Mayo  sauce. Well done but not burnt.\n\nMy burger was perfectly made and very flavorful. My coworker knew there would be a problem with hers once she saw a bit of blood on the plate. She did try it, but it was not to her liking and had to send it back. The Manager eventually came back with the burger after it was refired and it was better, but not great. We did get an apology and he said he'd speak with the grill chef. We also got and shared some excellent crispy fries and the organic ketchup was better than most other ketchups you'll find. Definitely better than the popular brands. For drinks, I had a strawberry hibiscus tea, and my coworker had the cucumber blueberry lemonade. Both were good, but the lemonade was that perfect Country Time saying Not Too Tart, Not Too Sweet, and especially the cucumber taste pulled through. It was so good, I got myself one. \n\nThe restaurant was advertising they needed staff and this unfortunately was quite apparent. In a relatively crowded restaurant that more were showing up and others coming for takeout, the staff at the time we were there on a Friday just after opening (12pm) was only a waitress, Manager, and I think a single chef. They certainly did their best to get orders out, but people who came after us were served their food before ours. I can imagine how there could be severe issues during rush times. \n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience in a new lunch place. Friendly staff, and I'd come back.\n\nI should mention that the back of the menu has a bucketload of beer, cider, and mixed drinks available. When I ordered one, I was told something about the liquor license, so no alcohol was available. Turned out ok because of that awesome lemonade and maybe in the future we could get some of that mixed with some vodka or something!\n\n$65 including tax and tip for two build your own burgers, two drinks, appetizer Brussels sprouts, and side of fries.",

It's located on Route 66 in a very pretty neighborhood and part of the experience is enjoying the ambiance as you stand outside waiting to order.\n\nThis is the first place I ever had frozen custard, that luscious concoction that is richer than ice cream and usually prepared soft serve style to lend itself to all sorts of invention.   The richness is due to high butterfat and egg content and minimal air.\n\nImportant term:  \"concrete\" - the frozen custard equivalent of a Dairy Queen Blizzard, you pick your mix-ins and they blend it up into decadent goodness.\n\nOne of my favorite items at Ted Drewes is the Christie, which is actually a sundae:  a brownie, frozen custard, hot fudge, and caramel ($5).  Great diet food!\n\nHighly recommended to any frozen confection lover visiting St. Louis!!",

There were large groups of people in there with kids everywhere.  I mean the kids were just running loose and sticking their hands and faces all over the buffets.  It was just chaotic, and I was stressed, so I was stress eating at a buffet.  The guy fixing the steak didn't seem to understand the definitions of cooking temps.  I mean I told him medium, and I got a piece that was well done.  So, then I tried to compensate and told him medium rare.  I got rare.  Very rare.  The thing mooed at me and then got up and walked off the plate.  Both pieces had gristle through them.  Honestly, the food is what you would expect at a buffet and/or a GC, but I've seen them in a better state than this one.

  "text": "We love this park! Discovered it when I met a moms group here and there is so much to it. They have areas where you can plan soccer or basketball or so many other sports. \n\nThere are roads where you can basically go for a walk and circle the entire park. There's a section where there are benches and it's covered so there is plenty of shade and restrooms! It gets REALLY windy though so be warned.  The kids playground has a variety of things to play with for the younger and older kids. The downfall is that it is not covered.  The bigger issue I have are the large ant piles (most likely fire ants) which I am deathly allergic to. What if one of the kids walk through it by accident? One of my bigger fears.....",

My room was one of the smaller ones but the shower had twin heads! That was so much fun. I also took a bath in one of the casitas (they decorated it with rose petals, so cute!). There is a Lush a couple blocks on State Street and I highly recommend going there before using the jets! \n\nBreakfast was made to order and delicious!\n\nI'm 1000% coming back on a romantic weekend get away or with some girlfriends!",

The Chinese Buffett area is subpar however as you can notice right away the processed taste in the sweet chicken that they save. The grill however is another story. The jerk chicken which is very popular is generally good. Some hit and miss days, but I would say 90% of the time is has very good flavor. The staff are friendly and although it's generally packed, everything is organized and smooth flowing. I just say the sweet potato pie in the bakery section *not the regular one, the Eickhoffs Bakery Swet Potato pie is the BEST pie I have ever tasted. I brought it to work and all my co workers say the same thing. I kid you not, if you like sweets, try it...you won't ever regret it!",

I don't get it anywhere else because it just doesn't compare!\n\nIf you aren't a big fan of spice, you can get your tofu non-spicy but if you're like me and can't live without the kick in your mouth, you can get your tofu very spicy (or something in between) and trust me, it burns...oh-so-good!\n\nEach soon dubu arrives boiling and with a generous portion of rice. Before the tofu gets to your table, you're served with an array of side dishes which are quite delectable. \n\nThe last time my friend & I ate here, we ordered a side of BBQ Squid along with our tofu. The squid was pretty massive & had to be cut with a pair of scissors the waiter provided- once we cut it into chunks, it was easily devoured!\n\nThe staff is always courteous and very friendly, the menu prices are superb and their food is absolutely delicious.

  "text": "This review was for their Sunday brunch. I took a few days to mull over why I couldn't justify giving this place a 4 regardless of the great service, great view and nice ambiance.\n\nService was great. Sandy took great care of our table making sure to get whatever we wanted from the menu as well as accommodate special requests. One thing to note is that there was no clear beverage menu so we weren't sure what drinks, alcoholic or non-alcoholic, they had for us. \n\nThat being said, I would give this place 3.5 stars. \n\nWhen I go to the a buffet especially at at this price point, I'm already going in with the idea I'm going to indulge, indulge and indulge some more. Sadly, the Rusty Pelican's offerings didn't leave me feeling indulgent. \n\nThe set-up here is a separate room with seafood, omelette station, carving station (ham), bacon, potatoes, sausages and two types of pasta salad. It would have been nice to see a nice cheese selection and some great breads.\n\nThe seafood had ahi tuna slices, crab legs, oysters, and not deveined shrimp. Our table was a fan of the cocktail sauce though.\n\nThere was one attendant for the omelette station so the wait could get long (and others might poach your omelette...true story). ALL the omelettes that came out of the station were overdone and brown - definitely not my idea of a nice fluffy omelette. \n\nBesides this, there is a menu with items that the server will bring out for you as many times as you want. The favorite of the table seemed to be the mojo pork with garlicky mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and the \"risotto\" was more like a pilaf which had an odd taste to me. I wasn't a fan of the salmon seasoning either. The quiche was delicious though (it came as a tiny sliver but you could probably ask for more servings).\n\nThe fresh fruit with coconut yogurt that came wasn't exactly like it was described on the menu. It was missing both blueberries and strawberries. It only had pineapples, cantaloupe and honeydew.\n\nBelgian waffle was great. My brother was a fan of the whiskey butter. \n\nThe bread basket came with sad looking \"croissants\" and uninspired muffins. Our table didn't touch them at all.\n\nThere is a dessert table that had different things like a chocolate chip coconut bar, eclairs, coconut mousse, creme brulee and chocolate chip cookies. Nothing particularly was amazing.\n\nFor drinks, our table (8 people) stuck with mimosas the entire time we were there being unsure what else we could order. The servers promptly refilled our glasses with premixed mimosas from a pitcher on the side. \n\nThe view was nice but I wouldn't rush back any time soon ($30+ pp) unless I was in the mood to eat piles and piles of crab legs, which I was not.",

I was a little apprehensive about coming in, but I'm glad I trusted my instincts. \nUpon walking in we were politely greeted by our server and immediately seated in a booth. She helped me situate my sleeping infant in his car seat before she left to get the chips and salsa. She promptly returned with our water. \nI ordered the pork wet burrito. I was very full after finishing my meal and I enjoyed it very much. My girl friend ordered something off of the dinner menu. It looked like beef tacos of some sort. She complained that the beef tasted a little greasy, but other than that she said she liked her food. My son orederd the child's grilled cheese and french fries. He liked it, but I noticed that the cheese looked like the sliced fake cheese singles that you get at the store. For the price I would have expected it to be fresh shredded cheese. \nAn employee had brought her daughter to work with her (the cook I assume) while I am a single mom and I understand that plans fall through with babysitters,  the little girl kept coming up to our table. She wasn't a nuisance, I just felt bad because she looked hungry. \nOur service was on point. Our drinks were never empty and she brought our checks in a timely manner. I definitely feel she deserved the tip I left for her. I would recommend this place for any of my family or friends in need of a mexican food fix and if I'm in the mood and in the area, I would return.",

I immediately went on high alert, sniffing for the source.  Two blocks later, I found myself heading into French Market Restaurant.\n\nIn line with our general theme of gorging on some of the best food on earth in New Orleans and no longer quite as full after a charming 3 hour bike tour, we sat down at the bar and ordered the \"small\" seafood platter (~$24).  Michael, who tends bar, was kind enough to help me decide on the size, and boy was I grateful.  The \"small\" platter was HUGE!  We got a ton of perfectly plump oysters, huge and spicy boiled shrimp, 2 crabs and some corn and potatoes.  All of this was complemented by some excellent homemade cocktail sauce and some sinus clearing horseradish!  The restaurant has the largest boil(er?) in New Orleans and they have a pulleyed contraption just to get the seafood in and out.\n\nIt's not a fancy pants joint, but for me it was laid back and felt genuine.  People were extremely friendly, the food was extremely tasty and the prices were extremely reasonable.  What more do you really want?\n\nPARTING THOUGHT: I can't stop thinking about the oysters!",

Because it was a solid experience.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI knew that the fried pork sandwich was the main event, but I was too tempted by the Philly Cheesesteak with the picture of Geno's in Philadelphia on the menu next to it.  Luckily, my friend got the fried pork sandwich, so I was able to try both.\n\nBoth items were really great.  The cheesesteak did not taste like Geno's, but it was really good.  I expected it to be closer to the original cheeseteak king because the menu mentioned that included cheese whiz, but it seemed to be much greasier than Geno's. \n\nThe fried pork sandwich was really good and definitely unique.  It came with a spicy sauce, that apparently had an even spicier version as an option.  We were told by our server that the fried pork sandwich was going to be on some kind of food network show for spicy foods.  My friend got the more mild version though, and it was delicious.\n\nI will definitely go back to EATS!",

Even under those conditions I'd say order your food to go. It was down right cold inside when I decided to eat in. There are only a few small two seat tables there, which would be more convenient for the workers there than the customers...\nOn to the food.

Our recent Yelp's Cravin' For Asian Weekly Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/weekly?edition_id=wONFT-H307gq1Weu0g6nIg) informed me that Ninki offers 50% off an alluring assortment of sushi at all times. No kidding! Sounds too good to be true, right? \n\nThis is precisely why I had to venture out to Belle Meade for my veg sushi fix... well that is until I saw the fantastic lunch bento box deal at $6.95. Everything from the 4 pieces of sushi to the salad, miso soup, tempura, and rice were excellent. The portions were just right but the standout was the miso soup! You may not think that miso is very exciting but I appreciated the big chunks of shitake mushrooms and robust flavor. Yum in the tum. \n\nDon't judge this book by it's cover either. From the exterior, Ninki is nestled inside a dated strip mall but when you walk through the doors, it is a spacious and dark place to relax and enjoy tasty but affordable Asian cuisine. \nIf you're planning a dinner for a large group or a dinner party, the space has a couple of private areas that accommodate and there appears to be some flexibility in the layout of the space. \n\nI will definitely come back to Ninki but on my next trip, I will try the deeply discounted rolls instead. Definitely consider this spot for lunch or even a date too!",

  "text": "such a sweet place! you'd never guess such charm and tastiness are tucked away in this mini mall, but once you're in yah mon, you know you're in for a truly wonderful experience. \n\nupon entering, you're greeted by the lovely couple behind the establishment, and it's clear from the start that they care deeply about food and its presentation. this is not a place where you rush through your meal. items are brought out slowly, fresh from the kitchen, where they were lovingly coaxed from various ingredients into a beautifully presented supper.\n\nmy curried tofu with veggies was stellar, and the portion was enormous, serving me well as a second lunch the next day. super flavorful, and the veggies were perfectly done-just crisp enough but without a raw crunch. my dining compadres enjoyed their fish and steaks, and the bread pudding and coconut cake two of them took to go were reportedly stupendous.\n\ni unequivocally recommend yah mon for anyone's dining needs!",

  "text": "For the seven year anniversary of when we met, we decided to try somewhere we hadn't yet. \nWhen I need to find a new place to try I look on Yelp. The pictures, menu and reviews for M3 reeled me in...but the reason we chose M3 was for their Stroganoff. My husband LOVES stroganoff and I hardly make it at home. You should've seen the look of excitement he got when I mentioned it! And that was that. \nThe entrance is clearly stated in previous reviews and someone we still managed to get a little lost looking! Inside is warm woods and deep booths. The dining room was separate from the bar which makes it a bit more private. The two TVs add a pub feel. \nFirst I ordered a Moscow mule, and while it wasn't bad it wasn't special like some I've had...the menu is simple yet inspired. The Grilled Artichokes and the Brie cheese skillet caught our eyes. The artichoke was tender and flavorful grilled and the curry mango Brie bruschetta skillet was decadent and delicious!! My husbands not a big fan of Brie so I got ...all... of it HA! \nNext I ordered the creamy mushroom soup. The soup was earthy, and super creamy with huge slices of fresh mushrooms. Everything you would want in a creamy mushroom soup, it was the best! Finally my hubby got his stroganoff and I got the lamb. He says the meat in the stroganoff was very tender and the whole dish was perfect. \nThe lamb was perfectly cooked with a sweet yet tangy fig balsamic reduction. Out of this world. And the Marscapone polenta was very creamy (The consistency of mashed potatoes) and very very good. Finally the veggies were fresh, crisp and garlicky. A perfect addiction. \nBy the end I was stuffed to perfection! The waiter was on top of things, perfectly timing our entrees to come out right after our appetizer. He was great, and so was his bus boy, who was definitely on top of dirty dishes. \nFive stars. We will definitely be coming back!",

  "text": "I never thought I would be a fan of a Chicago style pizza since my heart belongs to New York style; however, Black Thorn has swayed my decision. \n\nThe first thing you need to know about Black Thorn is that you will wait at least 45 minutes to an hour before your pizza is ready! The second thing you need to know is that the pizza is worth the wait! Black Thorn is in fact the only pizza place in the city I will order a Chicago Style pizza-it is that good. The sauce has a bit of a \"kick\" to it which means I usually only eat 1 piece, but the slices are so thick and filled with so many toppings it doesn't even matter because I get full from just 1 slice! \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely as others have mentioned; kind of a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant, but aren't those typically the best? The service has been okay each time I've gone in for a visit. I can't complain. \n\nOverall, I think you have to experience this place for yourself and then let me know what you think!",

  "text": "This was a great experience from start to finish.\n\nOur server was so friendly and welcoming that we felt comfortable immediately despite being tired, stiff, and cold from our 10 hour drive from DC. We lucked out and got seated in the back of the restaurant in a space that could double as a private room. No other tables in the room were occupied for the entirety of our meal.\n\nThe bread and olive oil they brought out first was amazing - soft, still-warm fresh bread and quality oil for dipping. We started with the Cheese Fritters and Calamari Fritti, both of which were delicious. The Fritters were especially great - crunchy perfection on the outside and melty, stringy cheese on the inside. Dipping them in both the honey mustard and the marinara sauce they come with is a must.\n\nThe Calamari Fritti had a great crunch and wasn't over- or undercooked; there was enough chew to be comfortable but not so much that you began to worry about the health of your jaw. Eating at least half of it with the caper pesto sauce ensured I was happy throughout the appetizer course.\n\nFor dinner we had the seasonal pork special, the Chicken Margarite, and the Smoked Chicken Ravioli between the four of us. (One of us was so stressed out after our drive that he just wanted wine.) Each dish was rich, filling, and so satisfying on a cold night. The portions were also huge; we all had leftovers at the end despite the three of us sampling a little of each other's dishes.\n\nI wish we had had room for dessert but we were all so full that it wasn't an option. Next time I'm in Nashville I plan to return just to try the Chocolate Bread Pudding with rye whiskey caramel sauce. If it's as good as everything we had that night, I'm sure it'll be worth the trip.",

In addition to regular cakes, desserts and breads they have Latin ones which look amazing. There is tons of choice. As you keep walking, there is a hot food bar that looks and smells amazing. It is a bit overwhelming because the menu is set over the middle of the food, but if you just stand back and look for a minute you should be good to go. The produce section is next and it is beautiful. They have everything you find in a regular grocery, plus things I've only seen there. I love it! The isles are fun- again a mix of the usual and the imported/unusual. But my absolute favorite part is the meat counter. The meats are gorgeous and the prices are great.

  "text": "We enjoyed the foods here! Their spicy is actually pretty spicy - I got medium and it had a good kick. I love eating spicy foods so was pleasantly surprised that a medium would actually burn my mouth a bit. I ordered a pound of head on shrimp in the boil house sauce which is essentially all the seasonings/sauces, medium spicy. We also shared half a dozen of the char grilled oysters. Others had the mussels + shrimp no spice, shrimp po boy sandwich, salad, fettuccine noodles, fire brussels sprouts. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The restaurant was empty when we arrived on a Sunday lunch but slowly started to fill up closer to 1pm. Still plenty of tables available. \n\nWe got our foods within a decent amount of time. My pound of shrimp was pretty small - a pound of shrimp in the bay comes with much more shrimp... fortunately I wasn't too hungry and it was enough to fill me up. I think others would need double the portion to get full. The char grilled oysters came with cheesy/garlic toppings! It was really good and had the right amount of flavors. The shrimp seasoning was salty and tasty - I enjoyed the spice and sauces... especially the chunks of garlic. The fire brussels sprouts were crispy and delicious. It had a tiny kick of spice to it. Overall I enjoyed the seafood boil here and would definitely be back here if I'm in the area.",

  "text": "Interesting location considering Chipotle and Moe's are so close by.\n\nI walked in and didn't really know what to do. No one yelled \"WELCOME to The Lime!\" and there was no one else jn line in front of me for me to follow their lead and eavesdrop on their order. \n\nWhy was  I a little flustered upon walking in? Their menu is not very user friendly. My main issue was the disturbingly low occurrence of guacamole on it. I scanned the menu for something with guacamole on it, as I wanted whatever that would be (avocados being present on a menu item is usually how I decide what I'm going to pick). Nothing seemed to come with guac. Could I add guac to my meal? I had no idea how much it would cost since there was no mention of add ons, so I refrained. Perhaps it would have given my naked beef burrito (everything but the tortilla) some more flair. \n\nAnother gripe about the menu: be clear if \"beef\" means ground beef or steak. They had delicious looking steak cooking on the grill which is why I chose beef for my meal. I was pretty disappointed it ended up being ground beef.\n\nThey DO get major points for their salsa bar, which in addition to about 8 different salsas includes fresh cilantro. I'm a huge salsa verde fan, and theirs was pretty on point. \n\nOverall, this is a middle-of-the-road casual Mexican joint on par with Tijuana Flats or Moe's. I will give it another try but I'll probably go for a quesadilla or tacos since my burrito bowl didn't leave much of an impression.",

  "text": "Lord, this review is overdue - this is what happens when you plan your own wedding :( Anyway, thankfully I always take notes (dork), so despite the fact that my review is from warmer times I can say that Kermit's Bakeshop produces tasty treats that are primarily fun, and all in a very surprising location on Washington Ave. I live about 15 minutes away and not long after they opened I walked over with the explicit purpose of picking up a bunch of goods for us to try together. The place is really just take-out, although there is a small bar on the side. The one staffer at the counter was super nice and patient, and amused when I told him our plan to 'taste test' their baked goods that evening. He answered the few questions I had as I went along both cases, and packaged up everything in boxes so that nothing would get accidentally destroyed. I lugged my big order back to our apartment and later on we all had fun taking bites and commenting on each:\n\nHamburglar (no longer on the menu?): a soft vanilla cake bun with sesame seeds, creamy \"patty\" that tasted like thick fudgy milk chocolate with chocolate sauce and coconut flakes \"lettuce\", and raspberry sauce \"ketchup\" - its like getting a vanilla cupcake with chocolate fudge frosting,  sweetened coconut flakes and a raspberry jelly filling. Mostly just fun, but pretty tasty too.\nBallpark Frank (not sure if also still available): my husband's favorite treat, its a red velvet hotdog with I believe a white chocolate cream, pistachio \"relish\" all in a choux pastry bun. The pink frosting was off putting at first, but the first bite revealed the yummy, sweet flavors for a slight variation on the classic red velvet cake\nBanana Bread: this slice of quick bread was solid overall - moist, not too dense, a good banana flavor, and a sweet basic icing glaze on top with chopped walnuts\nChocolate chip cookie: large chunks of semisweet chocolate in a shortbread like cookie base, this cookie was kind of dry and compact, not a hit with anyone\nOreo Marshmallow: this was a damn fine glob of homemade fluff about the size of my palm - it was a special treat that day\nKermit Hole: this cookie was simple and therefore perfect - thin shortbread cookies sandwiched a thin nutella layer with a cocoa-sugar dusting. The light nutella flavor with the buttery shortbread was the perfect amount for balanced flavors\nPistachio tea cake: Delicious! Moist and sweet, though the pistachio flavor was subtle, with the top crust dusted with confectioner's sugar\nFinger 32 (again, no longer on the menu): this pastry was a roll with sweet, thin, moist cake layers with a cream filling, white chocolate ganache frosting, mini marshmallows and gold painted walnut pieces, and a thin shortbread-biscuit vanilla cookie bottom. The guy had said the words 'sweet potato,' which may have been in the filling. This was my favorite, and very pretty\nSmores: their version was rectangular with a thin marshmallow bottom dipped in chocolate with graham cracker crumbs dusted on top, and a graham cracker piece stabbing center. Good, but truth be told, homemade smores are the best \nChocolate Marshmallow Pop Tart: chocolate filling inside a flaky pop tart pastry dough and a basic chocolate icing glaze topped with a cookie crumble and mini marshmallows that were lightly torched. It was good not great, but if you like pop tarts then this is probably your type of treat - I actually didn't grow up with pop tarts, freak that I am\nHippie dippie whoo-pie: I wanted to like this, but it needed improvement. The cake was thin but dense, and moist like pound cake. The cream filling was a sweet cream with fruity pebbles within it. \nThere's something about the fruity pebbles flavor, and I realized that you have to love the cereal to like this whoopie pie. \n\nAll in all, it was a super fun, sugar-filled evening that we all greatly enjoyed. I would go back, and actually would like to try their savory items, but it's kind of out of my way to get to...and one reason why I haven't had a chance to go back. Once I get a free day on the weekend, though, all bets are off - or perhaps I should get delivery since they oh so conveniently offer it...",

  "text": "I went to Shanghai 1 with a group of 8 yesterday. We were craving soup dumplings and one of the guys in the group wanted to try out a new place (as opposed to the usual 'dim sum garden'). \n\nMy sister and I ordered steamed soup dumplings, cold cucumber, and a beef with chili pepper soup. Some of our friends got the Dan Dan noodles, the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and the sweet and sour soup. \n\nThe soup dumplings were good (not much different from Sakura or dim sum garden), but unfortunately nothing else was. \n\nThe beef w/chili pepper tasted not like a soup, but like sautéed beef thrown into a bowl of noodles and hot water. The broth tasted more like oil residue than anything else. \n\nThe Dan Dan noodles were bland. More reminiscent of spaghetti you'd get from your school cafeteria than Dan Dan. \n\nI tried the other soups as well and wasn't a fan of either. \n\nThe worst part was that once we left, one of our friends let us know that they'd once found a cooked cockroach in one of their soup dumplings -_-. This was apparently a few years back, but it still made me feel super uneasy. Given everything, I definitely don't think it's worthwhile coming.",

  "text": "Not my usual Dierbergs Market, but I wish it were. I stopped in with a friend who was doing some serious grocery shopping. I was amazed at how much nicer this location is compared to the one closer to my house. It's true when they say in retail, \"Location, Location, Location.\" It does make a difference. \n\nWhat impressed me, was the produce and meat departments. WOW! very impressive. I'm not even Jewish and I was also impressed with the Kosher section. So impressed, that I grabbed a few items that were on sale.\n\nOne section that was sort of a disappointment was their discount section. I guess everything really gets bought up here, because the variety of items was not as impressive as at my regular market and I do love a bargain. \n\nWhen checking out, I had to change lanes. The cashier was so rude and mean to the two people ahead of me, I was afraid of what I would say, if he crossed me. So I politely went to the next lane and waited my turn there. Some folks are not made for customer service, especially old curmudgeons. \n\nWill I return? - I would if I still lived in STL, but I've moved. \n\nWhen: September 17, 2020\nWhy: Power Grocery Shopping with a friend.",

  "text": "I ate here this past Saturday for lunch with 4 dining companions.  We decided upon Drago's after reading about it in an airplane magazine on a previous vacation.  Upon arriving there was a half an hour wait and you are rightfully not able to be seated without your full party present.  The entrance to the restaurant does not look like much more than a bar but once you make it through past the hostess area you are able to see that it is an absolutely cavernous space.  There were 2 interesting bars that I took note of with the first being beautiful up high in the middle of the dining room with the second one being in front of chefs cooking food.  Both were very cool and impressive.\n\nFor lunch we decided to start out with the Crabmeat Au Gratin Dip.  The dip was presented nicely and had large chunks of crab which tasted good.  I decided upon the Shrimp and Grits with Tasso for my entree and I was also able to have a decent amount of the seafood pasta that another dining companion had ordered.  All of the dishes ordered by our group came out plated nicely with vivid colors when able.  The Tasso of my Shrimp and Grits had a nice and spicy flavor as promised by my waiter and the shrimp tasted nice as well.  The only thing that I will complain about it is that I wish that I had some more grits to accompany it.  The seafood pasta also tasted good although there was not part of it that stuck out for me.  While I decided to pass on dessert, the rest of my dining companions did not.  They decided to split both the brownie and the bread pudding.  The brownie that came out was colossal and I believe could have fed the four itself.  Overall, everyone agreed that they really the desserts.  My only complaint with the lunch as a whole was the leisurely pace and which we went through our meals.  While for some a 2 hour 3 course lunch may be nice, I do not count myself among them.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the food.  Although the service was slow, the food was top notch and easily outweighed any other concerns I would have.",

To round out my meal, I added the small order of Egg Rolls (2). \n\nThey serve food \"family style\" meaning that they bring food out when it is ready (vice waiting for all items to be ready before serving). \n\nThis place is on the bottom story of a 2-story house and it is a long, narrow set-up. It's dimly lit  a bit of a \"grungy\" feel. Yet, it smells like fresh, delicious food and the wait staff and kitchen crew all greeted me upon arrival. The music is a mix of R&B and 80's hits. The menu is much smaller than most other Chinese restaurants and carry-outs too. However, that means that they do a few things VERY well.",

For the oysters, I did a simple squeeze of lemon and a dab of sriracha. I wish they had some ponzu sauce which would have given it a nice citrus/soy sauce taste. \n\nOur server often checked on how we were doing. We teased him to just take a seat and grab a few oysters when we overheard how he has been working long hours. :P The ambiance here is relaxing. There are hanging artificial fish and in the center is a real aquarium with live fish swimming about. Sadly we were too full to try the buffet here, so I'll write about that on my update once I give them a try.",

I'm a bit skeptical but as soon as I hear that they are grilled and are cooked with garlic and parmesan, I am sold. We walk over from our hotel and are seated almost immediately. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and attentive and quickly took our drink order and put in our app request. \n\nWe started off with their crabmeat au gratin, which came served with Zapp's potato chips and then split a dozen of their charbroiled oysters. This meal was a great foreshadowing of the food to come in New Orleans. Not only were these the best oysters I've ever had, but they are the only oysters I've ever liked and one of the best meals I had on my unconventional road trip from New Jersey to Colorado. \n\nDrago's wasn't incredibly busy on the night we visited, but it seems like the kinda place that can definitely fill up quick on a busy night. As others have mentioned, the only thing you should be getting from here are their oysters. The crab meat was certainly tasty but didn't match the $16 price tag. Also be prepared to spend some dough here as a dozen oysters will run you $20. Still not bad for some of the best you will ever have.",

Also luckily, there was no line at the time of my visit; we were able to walk right up and order. \n\nDespite the lack of crowd, it still took a little while to receive our beignets. I'm mentioning this as a positive! Boy did they taste fresh. There was a light crisp to the outside and they were filled with heaven on the inside. I can see why they are referred to as heaven's pillows. \n\nThe small coffee was still a fairly decent size and it was strong. If you like strong coffee, this coffee is good. \n\nIt had been raining a little earlier so my friend and I ate at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and chatted with us most of the time. \n\nThis café was set back in an adorable courtyard.

A couple blocks off State St., it's in a great location away from the hustle and bustle. The beach is practically across the street and Stearns Wharf is a 5 minute walk.\n\nFor the value, location, and warm Customer Service, we would definitely stay here again if we found ourselves in Santa Barbara.",

They do provide heaters that only work for the couple tables that are sitting in front of them.  You have to walk to get your food all the way in the back.  They have a bar area and a restaurant area (which you can only order at).  They do bring you your food while your sitting which is nice.\n\nThe food was TINY for what I paid.  I was so mad.  They charged me 50 cents for a cup of hot water.  I was pissed about that, too.  The food wasn't even that good.  Right after we were done, we immediately left and got breakfast at a better place.  Don't even waste your money or time eating here.  They even wanted tips at the counter?  Tip for what!??  Here's a tip, lower your prices and hire a chef to change your menu.",

Don't know, but when mixed with sausage, potato, onion, peppers, all wrapped up in an fresh egg case, they become an amazing sensory explosion.  \nTrenton may have seen better days (we have been waiting for its resurgence since it was \"Americas Town\" in the 60's), but Pat's carries on.\nDiners are only partially about the food, and the rest about the concept, design, and lustful loyalty they inspire. \nPat's is a worthy contender for the Urban Diner List on Yelp* (If there is one). \nGive it a try. \nSit at the counter and watch professionals do their thing. Sit at a window and see a worldview that captures the past-its-prime city, the capital of the Garden State, remind you that... We Are Still Here.",

  "text": "What a terrific new addition to Chinatown.  This new restaurant is nice on the eyes and great on the tongue.  The food is Shanghai and Taiwanese cuisines .... and a good idea is probably to order something from both of these Chinese culinary traditions.  The one appetizer you must try without a doubt are the incredible beef scallion pancakes from Taiwan.  With beef, scallions, and an oyster sauce inside - you will not want to share them with anyone else at your table.  You want to eat them all yourself! \nAnd to add to the great dining experience at this restaurant, the service was extremely attentive and friendly.\n\nWith the current Korean chicken craze in full flame, I'm planning on coming back to Shanghai 1 to try their Taiwanese lightly salted chicken.  Everyone tells me it is really tasty.  Judging by what I've already eaten at this restaurant, I believe it!",

NO!\n\nEach server needs someone behind them to bus the tables, clean off the used dishes, fill the water glasses.  This way, each server can concentrate on each person at the table, who is going to tip them based on how well the server performs.  And that server depends on those tips, so she is going to work her best, to make sure you have a good experience.\nSomeone needs to be behind them, to make them perform, top notch and that isn't happening and everyone is complaining about service.\nFood is good. Some creative dishes, good variety, ample servings.. I see nothing wrong with the menu.  A little something for everyone.  We enjoyed fondue between the two of us and our meals and our dessert.  It was wonderful as far as flavor, the way each dish was prepared, the ample serving so that some could go home with us..  Dessert was delicious, although our first choice was already sold out.  I think dessert is as big a profit maker as alcohol, no?  Why wouldn't you have more desserts prepared?  Hmmm..\nDessert was large enough for both of us to enjoy.  Main dishes were very large portions. Food was cooked to desired request.\nIt was a good experience, except for watching the waitstaff speed run past our table every 20 seconds with a look of anguish on her face, never thinking to stop and ask us if we would like a drink.. Or a menu.. Or a glass of water.  We were completely ignored  for a good 10 minutes, while they bussed their own table, poured their own water at their tables, took drink orders..  Someone could have come and given us a drink menu, filled our glass.. while our server finished up with someone else.  Right?\nSo simple.  So easy to achieve, and yet, so frugal.\n\nIt could very well be your demise --- if you're reading this.",

Theoretically, Whole Foods is expensive.  It an establishment that sells high-end organic produce and grain fed meats, yet I can rock and roll the joint with less than a bill.  \n\nWhat Whole Foods is really great for is freaks like me who are allergic to things.  For instance, I am allergic to cow dairy.  I still like cheese and yogurt but it has to come from a goat or a sheep or something like that, which Whole Foods has and most large chain grocery stores do not.  What I don't like about Whole Foods is that being a large chain grocery store they run independent organic markets out of business like crazy.  And it's a dilemma.  For me to get the same amount of food at Essene that I get at Whole Foods, it would cost me around 30% more, which I can't afford, so often I end up at the big store.",

And at 5 pm was filling up pretty good. \n\nNote the entrance is on the Lakeside of the building so you don't have to walk around the entire building to find the right door- like me. The interior is very nice- rustic painted cement floor and walls that look like various reclaimed boards. I like the over all appearance. \n\nBeing the first time there, the only server I can comment on was Charlotte. Damn that girl is a perfect server. Subtle  suggestions - a drink from the bar, \"we have a great bartender.\"  Or an appetizer or two while looking the menu over. She saw my indecision and said take your time, I'll bring the drinks. For a new restaurant she seemed to know the menu pretty good and made a couple of suggestions. One two sided menu has sandwich, burger $10-14, salad $9-15 and small plate choices $9-14. The second menu had more of a dinner selection - ribeye $20, pasta $13, and lamb chop $18. The food arrived on, my personal favorite, HOT plates. My three tacos were so stuffed you couldn't fold them in half and tender beef, fresh crisp cabbage and a creamy cool cilantro sauce. Hubby enjoyed the rigatoni with mushrooms and chicken in a cream sauce.  \n\nA nice variety of wines from $5 to $11 a glass and also available by the bottle. Also a reasonable beer list. \n\nOf coarse Charlotte returns with a final suggestion and tease of some decadent sounding desserts. Next time, we were just too full. \n\nWill  absolutely be returning there were several other items we really wanted to try.",

  "text": "To kick of Philly's first Restaurant Week of 2013, I felt like indulging my primal urges and quite simply ... felt like digging into a prime rib. So when I saw that The Prime Rib on the list for Restaurant Week, I couldn't help but head over for their eponymous dish.\n\nEntering into the Philly outpost of The Prime Rib, the atmosphere felt slightly stuffy, as if I was coming in for a power lunch/dinner. Happy Hour was in full effect (I hear it's great actually according to Yelp), and all the patrons were easily twice my age. The latter is understandable due to the high price point for the majority of the dishes at The Prime Rib. Still, we're talking about a prime rib joint and not reinventing cuisine. And that's ok! Sometimes all we need is a nice slab of meat, great service, and a pianist riffing on a clear-top grand piano. Nothing else.\n\nBread Service\n\nThe bread was served warm, which I appreciated, along with the spreadable room-temp butter. Decent variety, but pretty standard.\n\nRoasted Tomato Soup\n\nThe tomato soup came out hot with a sweet, tangy undertone from the roasted tomatoes. Delicious and a nice way to whet my carnivorous appetite.\n\nHouse Salad\n\nThe GF opted for the house salad, which was a bit over-dressed with ranch. However, there was a nice mix of chopped egg whites, fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and mixed greens. The pepperoncini offered some bite to the dish.\n\nFamous Potato Skins ($10 supplemental)\n\nI can't resist anything advertised as 'famous.' So I obviously went for the potato skins, which did not disappoint. They were unadorned with anything fancy like bacon bits or cheese, but that's ok when we're talking about something that is so simple that's done so right.\n\nThe innards were scooped out, resulting in skins that were crispy on both sides. Perfect vessels for the accompanying horseradish and sour cream, which worked well to bring some fresh flavors to the dish.\n\nGrilled Atlantic Salmon\n\nThe salmon had nice seasoning and a decent crust from the grill. However, the GF wasn't the biggest fan since it didn;t taste particularly fresh and was frankly, a bit dry.\n\nRoast Prime Rib of Beef\n\nThis 12 ounce slab of beef was well-roasted and seasoned. However, there were portions of the beef that were whole unappetizing chunks of fat. The accompanying grated horseradish was frankly chewy and didn't taste that fresh.\n\nThe outer crust that I typically enjoy on prime rib was also quite dry and inedible in some parts. Still, the parts of the beef that were edible were enjoyable and exactly what I was looking for in a good prime rib. I'll chalk the rest up to Restaurant Week demands. \n\nCreamed Spinach\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu advertised roasted vegetables, which was actually a duo of dishes that are typical of any steak or prime rib joint. The first was the creamed spinach, which unfortunately was a weak iteration of this standard dish. This was a soupy mess - indicative of what may have been frozen spinach. Butter shone through rather than the essence of spinach.\n\nMashed Potatoes\n\n The mashed potatoes were sufficiently smooth but were fairly standard. It would have been nice to seen these spruced up.\n\nKey Lime Pie\n\nThe key lime pie was perfectly smooth and tangy with a nicely light, thin graham cracker crust. A nice way to cleanse the palate, especially after a heavy meal.\n\nCreme Brulee\n\nThe creme brulee had a perfect sugar crust and the custard was creamy and redolent with vanilla essence.\n\nOverall, if you're in the mood for prime rib and have deep pockets, I would suggest giving The Prime Rib a try. Regardless of whether it was Restaurant Week or not, we came for an early dinner and the restaurant was not close to being packed by the time we paid the bill. I can't see myself coming back anytime soon as this dining experience was rather lackluster. However, I may just have to stop by for a drink and some of their potato skins.",

If I had to compare it to anything, it would be to the back room of a synagogue where they do the kiddush. But they have the best dumplings I've ever had, hands down. What I've had of their entrees hasn't been memorable, which isn't a bad thing. Service is prompt and friendly, and the complimentary tea is just perfect.",

  "text": "An interesting tour of New Orleans with a great guide. We did the afternoon tour of four neighborhoods, a cemetery, and a distillery. \n\nWe booked through one of the tourist spots in the French Quarter. The woman there was able to give us availability, book, and give us meet up information. Since our tour was on a holiday and the parade closed many downtown roads our meet up spot was an arbitrary intersection. Normally the bus can pick up and drop off at hotels. The tour was about two and a half hours with a stop for bathroom breaks in the middle.\n\nThe driving portion of the tour was great, especially since it was very cold the day we did our tour. Our guide was Rene and he gave us city information the entire time we were driving around the city. Some of the information was historical and some was interest like pointing out homes of famous residents. He kept the tour interesting.\n\nThe cemetery portion of the tour was interesting as well. It seems odd to go to a cemetery, but it is an important part of learning about the city. We were given about 10 minutes to walk around after Rene gave us information about the cemetery. \n\nThe last part of the tour was a stop at Seven Three Distillery. The distillery gave us a quick tour of the facility as well as a taste of their vodka or gin which in total lasted about 30 minutes. It was a nice distillery and a nice enough tour, but it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the tour. It would definitely be fun as part of a separate drinking themed tour. Maybe a new tour option idea that goes to local distilleries and breweries? \n\nOverall, a great way to see and learn about the city on a day too old to walk!",

  "text": "Visited last night for restaurant week. As it's aptly named, they are known for their prime rib and wow it was melt in your mouth delicious! \n\nAside from the ignorant hostess (short blond hair, older woman) and the lack of appropriate # of servers for the amount of people, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner with family and a friend (party of 5).\n\nOur waiter Vinny was fantastic and very social BUT spread way too thin which meant longer wait times on drinks, no serving spoons for the family style served mashed potatoes and string beans for the table and forever to get coffee to go with our desserts (coffee arrived after everyone was done). Our tip appropriately complimented Vinny as a great server, it isn't his fault they don't have enough wait staff. Monday (the following day) they had over 500 people coming with only 8 servers staffed. Think about that. Last night there were approximately 350 diners, and it showed in attentiveness of the wait staff. Again, NOT the servers fault at all, Vinny was great. \n\nThey have a full service bar and extensive wine list but it is also BYOB so we enjoyed our favorite wines. \n\nParking is ugh... it is Center City, so parking garages are expensive and street meter parking is an adventure to find. However I am in love with the new meterup app the city of Philadelphia has instituted and it's only $3 an hour for meter parking that you can add time to from your smartphone. We also found out that handicap tagged cars get an hour free parking on Sundays in the city! \n\nRestaurant is beautiful, well laid out, has a nice ambiance with a piano player (who takes tips), upper scale normal pricing approx $60 per person, dressier than a casual place so dress up and go have an amazing night out in the city starting with a wonderful prime rib dinner.",

There's a soft serve ice cream place in Lynden, Washington I couldn't imagine being superseded by anyone, but truly, Ted Drewes did circles around my previous number one.\n\nWhat is so special about their frozen custard?  For me, it's the right balance of creaminess, flavor, and lightness.  It's not heavy feeling as you eat it and sits in your stomach.  The custard makes it taste like a proper vanilla flavor.  Not too sweet either.  It's not icy or watery, but a very creamy consistency.  It really is wonderful.\n\nWe were in St. Louis on a hot summer night so the line was long, orderly, yet fast moving.  We ordered our treats and enjoyed them in the parking lot.  So good.  \n\nIf I make subsequent trips to St. Louis, I will make time in my calendar to come here for a soft serve.",

We were all hungry after visiting the Christmas Village for the holidays and with several restaurants across from us, we decided to choose this place for their decent reviews.\n\nI ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and beef scallion pancake for appetizer. I am fortunate enough to be living in Las Vegas for nine years where Asian soup from different parts of the world is not hard to find. I would have to say that the beef soup here was less than satisfaction. I prefer my meat cut smaller rather than large chunks, but the meat was very tender. The broth overall was good, but I prefer the Taiwanese  beef noodle soup at Noodle Pot in Vegas.\n\nAs for the beef scallion pancakes that seems to be very popular here, is not so popular with me. The sauce was too sweet for me and the pancake was a little bit chewy. The temperature was almost at room temperature that may had contributed for being a little bit chewy. Liang's Kitchen in Vegas has awesome beef scallion pancakes served warm and is seasoned well.\n\nThe ladies were great and service was super quick.

He even did a great job of diffusing the awkwardness of some \"difficult\" painters and made us laugh in the process.\n\n$5 \"liquid courage\" -- Red and white wines, mimosas... very generous pours and quality product for just $5 a glass.\n\n\nWhat sets them apart:\nThey let you customize your color palate so your painting can complement your decor -- which was really nice.  Other similar places already have your stuff set up and colors are predetermined when you arrive.  Not at Mimosa & a Masterpiece.  They will even give you a quick overview of which colors look good together to ensure you are on the right track.\n\nYou are encouraged to \"make it your own\" -- meaning they will provide a loose guide and framework, but not a step-by-step on how to make your painting look EXACTLY like theirs.  This is great for the creative or rebel painter...and it's all in fun anyway, right?  \n\nSo yes.  We will return to Mimosa & a Masterpiece again.  SO. MUCH. FUN.",

  "text": "Elk, wild boar, goat burger? All in one place and conveniently located just 5mins from home? Sweet. \n\nOur waiter Tony was pretty awesome. Normally I wouldn't remember our servers name. But he repeated it enough for it to stick in my head. Being our first time at Bareburger, he explained the items on the menu and told us which stood out the most. \n\nWe got the Bison and Elk... They were definitely a different texture from the normal cheeseburgers you get. The meat was very soft and tender. We also got the fries and rings with the sauce. If you want the one with the sauce, make sure you order that one. Because there's a regular fries/rings and fries/rings with sauce (i saw a snobby woman at the table next to me pretty much demanding for her sauce. I say., she prolly ordered the wrong one). Anyways, they have four types of sauce., which i forgot and too lazy to google it back up.. But you'll see it on the menu. We also got the ginger green tea. The ginger was very powerful. Enough for me to forget that it was tea that i ordered and not ginger ice water. \n\nWhy three stars? The portions quite small. And the prices are a little bit on the higher side. 2 burgers, fries/rings, and 2 green tea for a little over $40. \n\nThe experience is worth it if you want to try Elk or even goat =)",

  "text": "It's been quite a while since I was last at Brio, and not a lot has changed since the last time.\n\nBrio's always had a nice location at the corner of the Plaza Frontenac parking lot overlooking Manchester Road, with a large outdoor patio for diners. The other week, the weather turned nice enough that we decided to try dining outside for a change and Brio sounded good.\n\nWhat I always forget about Brio is that even at lunch time nothing is under $10 on the menu. At least they've started adding some healthier options to the menu in addition to the pastas, flatbreads, soups and entrees. And although the menu seems large, it's actually a bit sparse in options (and my mom asked for the gluten free menu and was given a list as small as the little special card - not very accommodating, in my opinion).\n\nI ended up ordering a quinoa chicken salad, my mom had the strawberry fields salad with chicken and my dad got the lobster bisque and salad. Everything was fine, but I wasn't overly impressed, especially since everything was $12 or more. It just seems expensive for what it is.\n\nLuckily, we went on a weekday, but on the weekend, trying to get in for lunch is nearly impossible without a reservation. Brio's is very popular even though it's just average as far as food goes. But I guess if you want to see and be seen in Frontenac, it's a safe bet.",

The shop was busy with tourists and students but that is to be expected since it was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  \n\nThere is no \"line begins here\" sign. You just push in wherever there is space, get someone's attention and place your order. I noticed they had unique flavors like Mexican hot chocolate and lavender honey. After requesting a few samples, I went with a scoop of salted caramel. Creamy and good.  The service wasn't exactly warm and friendly . More like blunt with no personality. The girl hurriedly took our orders and directed us to the cash register. Not exactly tip worthy.  \n\nOverall, a cute little spot to stop in for a snack if you're in the area.\n\n\nWARNING:\nMake sure you bring cash as they do not accept debit and/or credit cards.",

  "text": "Came here with the family. As a Filipino-American, especially being a first born in America, my lens for things is different. And needless to stay, I've noticed that there are not many Asian people walking around Tuscon or going into Mexican restaurants in Tucson (or even AZ as a whole). That being said, when we first walked in with a group of 7 of us, we got strange looks from the wait staff and kitchen peaking at us!  And after a couple of minutes and big smiles from our group, the wait staff ladies eventually warmed up to us and showed us their smiles. I have to admit that was a tense 3 minutes! \n\nCame here after reading on the \"visit Tucson\" website that this place was on the famed 12-miles of authentic mexican food, and they served a proprietary dish called chicharon camarones...basically fried shrimp balls. Hmmm I was intrigued! Overall I agree with some that this wasn't the \"best\" mexican food I've had. It was pretty standard tasting really. Maybe my taste buds are biased because I'm a San Diego born Mexican food lover. California does it's Mexican Food different than Arizona! However this restaurant does have some stand out dishes that aren't found at every Mexican joint. I wish I would have ordered more of the seafood items here. Here's the quick and skinny on the rest of the food/place:\n\nPros:\n-Large portions, freshly prepared food\n-Quick service\n-Cheese Crisps! I actually think this was my favorite item of food I ordered. It's huge, tasty and really satisfying. Don't call it a mexican pizza, tho it looks like it. It's way better, less \"doughy\". \n-Chicharon camerones, yes this is different. It's not flavored a whole lot which is good because you can taste the shrimp and they served it with sauce. This is different, I haven't seen this item at any other mexican/latin restaurants I've been to. \n-Service was quick, but it wasn't a busy evening either. \n\nBeing that there are so many other Mexican restaurants in Tuscon and Tuscon is a \"gastronomic city\" I'd have to try other restaurants in town to really know what the food scene is about in this town.",

This small, cozy restaurant was the perfect place to quickly grab a bite on a rainy day. \nWe ordered their spicy fat noodles and coconut curry noodles. The spicy fat noodles are different, not in a broth, and have a spicy sesame flavor to them. The cocunut curry reminds me a vegetarian version of ramen. I personally like the coconut curry noodles wayyy more than the fat noodles. \nSide note: apparently the garlicwings are amazing, every table had them. \nRegardless of what you order, you MUST get a thai iced tea.

Because... the owner announced this week that the restaurant will only be open through June 27, 2021. Oh my...\n\nIf you need a reason to try out this pizza then please continue reading my review. Through the pandemic my husband and I tried to enjoy the fact that we suddenly had weekends together--like every weekend--so we created our Friday night ritual, Pizza Friday. We stumbled upon Food+ Drink during our Reno pizza tour and immediately were in love! The pizzas paired well with our \"to-go cocktails\" from other local joints. However, the pizza was truly delicious, especially the Kendy! All the ingredients were fresh and made from scratch. The difference was noticed from the very first bite of pizza all the way to the last bite of their Magic Cookie. Oh, yes! I loved that cookie. We first had it because the owners' mom gave us a complimentary one with our pizza. So sweet! After that we were hooked!\n\nThe owner, Aaron, spent most of the pandemic working with his parents and keeping their bubble safe and healthy while still serving up some great pizza. Now he has some friends on his crew who were moving to Reno and getting settled. Food + Drink was a safe place for his family and friends as well as a safe place for my family. \n\nToday (and for the next week) the restaurant will be open for pick-up, outdoor dining, and indoor dining. If you want to dine indoors be sure to bring proof that everyone in your party is vaccinated. Still important to be safe y'all. Anyways, if you haven't been yet I would highly encourage anyone to check it out before the doors close forever. I went tonight and will miss their delicious food.",

The store was very clean an organized. Every employee had masks on.  All of the staff, from the people stocking the shelves to the cashier, were friendly and professional.  As I walked around the store, I was asked several times if I needed assistance. They had markers on the floor indicating  where 6 feet apart would be and had signs all around the store on the shelves with friendly reminders that we should socially distance to keep ourselves and others safe. You can buy online and pickup curbside and that's really helpful since we're going through this pandemic. The one thing I would say is you should bring your own sanitary wipes because they don't wipe down the carts or the little carriers so you can social distance all you want but if you touch that surface where somebody else was sick then those germs now belong to you too :-) So just give yourself some added protection, keep those wipes on hand. Which by the way,  you can buy at Big Lots! Big Lots has everything. I even picked me up some more Cafe Bustelo, cereal, and sarsaparilla :-)",

  "text": "With 6 burger joints opening in the next year, I feel it is my duty to get this review in the books. I'm excited about the new burger offerings but they will have their work cut out for them. Burger Republic is top notch. You have high hopes for a place that specializes in three distinct things; burgers, beers, and milkshakes. After surveying the menu I chose the west coast burger. It consists of two thinly pressed patties mustard steamed with american cheese, BR sauce, lettuce, tomato, and onions. It was perfection! I actually likened it to the Husk burger. I was equally as stuffed after this burger too. I paired my patty with tator tots. They were classic, nothing crazy, but if you like truffle tots this is where you need to be! We also split the Philly egg rolls which were good, but next time I may only get a burger, mostly because of its size. The manpanion was equally as impressed with his burger, as was the rest of the table. As for the milkshakes, they were super rad! They have spiked milkshakes and regular milkshakes. I went with the Chocolate Peanut Butter and the honeybee went spiked with the Maple Bourbon. They were both crazy good! They were thick, they had a ton of whipped cream, and they were flavorful. I was slurping the bottom trying to get every last drop. Finally the beer, they have the usual Nashville suspects. It's hard when our distribution is so limited.\n\nAs for the ambiance it's cool and casual. They have large booths, large TVs, garage doors, and a large patio. Everything you would want when slurping down a milkshake or indulging on a giant burger. The service was fantastic and our food came out in a timely manner. Actually a little faster than timely. They were on the ball! Burger Republic has officially moved into my top 5 burger joints in the Nash.",

But with the larger spot that Mood Cafe offers, Hassan and his crew have really managed to kick things up a notch and do some of the traditional and innovative recipes that their previous area couldn't maintain.\n\nMood does have a lot of the same menu offerings as Desi. But the larger food prep space does allow them to engage the customer with a lot more presentation when they put together the many ingredients that goes into their chaat recipes. This can make for a good interactive show of sorts that caters to your customization; especially when you factor in the number of spices, nuts, fruits, and other ingredients that you can add. Add in some chaat recipes variations that take on influences from other cultures, and things really start to get interesting.\n\nAnother plus to Mood is that its menu puts much more emphasis into the lassi, ice cream, and hot beverage side of the menu, making it a great spot to go to please your sweet tooth and grab a beverage on the go.

We found the painting class via Social Media for a Friday date night option with all of the instructions posted.  You had the option to order painting kits from them with or without brushes (here's a link:  https://squareup.com/store/picasso-and-wine/item/complete-art-kit) or you could even paint along with your own supplies, talk about easy - now that's AWESOME!  There was a deadline to order the kits from them as their hours are limited, understandable with everything happening currently and they even offered delivery for the area around the studio.  With us living in Carson City we were limited on time with our work schedule for pickup but not to worry Picasso & Wine also shared another outlet for ordering additional supplies for the online class - they ROCK!  We opted for the online supplies and they arrived on time for the our digital date night.\n\nPainting was LIVE on Picasso & Wine Facebook page at 7pm PST with Jen giving detailed instruction that was a FUN pace.  We never felt like we were falling behind or not able to understand her, although she couldn't hear us we were able to give her thumbs up and hearts or type messages to her in the chat section of the live feed as we followed along.  My hubby and I truly enjoyed Jen and her husband as they playfully bantered back and forth, laughed, painted and successfully guided us through a GREAT date paint night.  Look forward to our next at home paint date night!\n\nHIGHLY recommend the online virtual painting classes ~ the instructors and painting are great FUN!!  Be sure to check out their upcoming classes, they have FREE ones for not just date night but for the kids and some that are only $10 - now that's AWESOME!!  Here is the class that we did for $10 (https://squareup.com/store/picasso-and-wine/item/happy-campers)  We also had the option (which my hubby and I took advantage of) to 'Donate To Our Artists Fund' by showing your appreciation to the artist that instructs the online paint class by going to the Picasso & Wine page here:  https://squareup.com/store/picasso-and-wine/item/donate-to-our-artists-fund - please let them know you appreciate them!\n\nBelow is the list of supplies we used for this class:\nArt Supply List: \n2-12x16 canvases\nPaints-Red, Lemon Yellow, Cobalt Blue, Ultra Marine Blue, Burnt Umber, White, Black\nBrushes-1\" Flat Brush, 1/4\" flat brush, #6 round brush",

Located in Boise's Northend near downtown, surrounded by a small row of restaurants, bars, and the like in a residential neighborhood, sits this cute and nostalgic candy store. \n\nOnce you walk in you'll be greeted with many yummy smells. To the right of you is the candy corn area and to the left is many plus animals and toys that you can purchase-- there is also one of the penny flattener machines in this area, too. \n\nOnce inside you can get your choice of many different pieces of candy from chocolates to gummy bears, or even get yourself a banana split or brownie sundae (see my photos). If you're in the mood for espresso they've got you covered, too! \n\nI can only imagine warm summer evenings at this place. I've been twice and both times were after having dinner with my friends in nearby restaurants. I can't wait to take my kids here!\n\nThe staff is friendly and welcoming. The prices are fair, better than the candy shop in the mall. The name says soda fountain and I didn't really pay attention to any sodas or notice them.",

I loved the show which I though it was worth 4 stars but I felt like the food quality to price ratio made this place worth 2 stars.\n\nI had the Benihana salmons with avocado tartar sauce with udon noodles. Which sounds lovely but the dish was not extraordinary. The avocado tartar was disappointing. I ordered salmons because I have borderline high cholesterol and shellfish/steaks might push me over the edge to heart disease land. :( i feel like the show may be worth the experience if you have never done so.",

The parking lot is tiny, the store is crazy packed, and there are only TWO restrooms.  The meat department is teeny tiny and doesn't have much of a selection. I was surprised at how small of a store this was and the limited items they carried.  It's almost as identical to the whole foods on south street which is an even worse location with the same store size. I'll stick to shopping at the cherry hill location.

This Indian restaurant is huge, it seems to cater to large parties and banquets, there were a lot of people there at 10 PM on a Saturday night and they were ALL Indians (or maybe Pakis or Bangladeshis) except me.

I appreciated that he did not oversell or overexaggerate anything, and provided a skeptical point of view and was very \"matter of fact\" about the happenings described. \n\nSomehow I thought the \"Five in One\" tour would be five different tours, or perhaps five tour guides, combined in one tour.  But this tour has one story each from five supernatural factual histories from the French Quarter, including Vampires, Zombies, Ghosts, Voodoo, and \"Magic\".  \n\nAt the end, our group was all given a \"magic spell\" to do at home to attract love into our lives.  Eye roll, but fun none the less.  \n\nI don't know how this compares to other tours.  Our group was large and the tour was fun and interesting.",

From the sleek and sexy cantina bar to the delicious salsa trio with a kick, Nada puts a modern spin on Mexican cuisine. I can't get enough of the salmon tacos topped with chipotle crema, jalapeno corn pico, and cilantro - a fiesta in my tummy. The senor mu shu taco is also a winner in my book.\n\nAt lunch, the \"taco lunchbox\" includes two tacos (no mix and match option available), a side (most of which are healthy - go for the pickled cucumber salad for a refreshing crunch) and two \"almost guilt free\" donut holes. \n\nNot feeling tacos? Try the seasonal gazpacho - the greek yogurt and avocado adds a nice creaminess. The chicken tortilla soup is also worth checking out.\n\nYou can't go wrong with your selection at Nada. I highly recommend checking it out to get out of your burrito routine.",

I stopped in for a late lunch and ordered from the lunch menu (General Tso's Chicken, Fried Rice, Broccoli with a bowl of Wonton Soup).\n\nThe soup was actually the strongest part of the lunch. The chicken consume base was tasty, and the wontons, although somewhat thick skinned, actually had a decent flavor, too. The general's chicken was a large mound of amber glossed bird nuggets. About half of them were the right texture and taste, while the others were either too thickly skinned, or too crunchy to enjoy. Could not always taste the meat within. The fried rice was a large helping with adequate veggies to keep it interesting. Of course, the broccoli florets were there for decoration more than consumption. \n\nThe meal was just okay overall.  I appreciated that there was a dining room where I could sit and eat lunch.  It would have been even better if they used real plates and flatware, rather than styro and plastic, and a take out container for the soup.  Service was provided by the cashier who was attractive and pleasant to all customers.  \n\nThe sign out front is worn and faded, and could use a little TLC to keep the shop from looking worse than it is. A little fresh paint and relettering would make China Chef a more upbeat place to chow down (no pun intended).",

However this place went 0-3 on all three dishes. \nThe positives. The location and the view. Not the best view from a Dunedin eatery but very good nonetheless. They have several tables to sit at and quite a few seats on the inside railing with counters. The two waitresses were excellent today. Never had to wait for a thing. They were on point. If one of us was out of water and the other waitress saw that she would immediately bring a new cup. They are perhaps the best waitress team of all time also the reason to add a star. Other positives are the extensive beer offerings and the prices of 4-5 for each one. \nThe food I most likely would not go back for:\nA special of Parmesan crab and shrimp dip was available. It was like warm. It did not taste very appealing and there were textures of coagulation like it was microwaved and cooked in certain areas. There was a decent amount of crab but only one piece of shrimp that we found. \nThe cod tacos were also not very good. The fish tasted fresh and cooked properly. However the slaw was undressed raw cabbage and at the bottom of the taco was a large amount of straight lime juice. And not the sweet kind. Some type of cream would have brought this from a 2-4. \nFinally the 14 dollar blackened scallop wrap. Not edible in any way. There was no texture or carmelization on the scallops. The blackening was just a spicy mixture that mixed with some liquid and just poured out of the wrap. We took most of this home and hopefully I can try and save the scallops and get some of the 14 bucks worth. There is nothing worse than blackening season that was not cooked and BLACKENED. Blackened means to blacken the seasonings to char them if you will. It does not mean to just have a spicy seasoning on it. That is called seasoned. \nI would probably go back to enjoy the view a beer and the great service but the food is off limits for us.",

Or it was because of the bar crowd *shrug*.\nAfter going for an extended walk one afternoon, I brought my girl to the new Santa Fe location. We'd built up an appetite and needed some food.\n I told her a bit about how it was long ago and had hopes that it would still be similar. After all, it's just a different building, right?\nRight?\nWe stop in and it's empty. I mean totally empty.\nI walk in for a bit and finally, someone steps out from the back, looks surprised to see us and quickly gets us some menus. That was the only quick response the entire meal.\nI noted that the prices went up. Ok...I can get that. Though some of it looked a bit too high for what it was, but again, we were hungry.\nWe ordered two beers and some water. Maybe 10 minutes went by before the beer arrived...no water.\nAnother 10 minutes go by (What? is there an inviso-crowd here that's keeping them occupied?) and she comes back to ask what we anted to order.\nMy girl ordered the Ensalada de pollo and I ordered the burrito. I asked for it extra spicy. She verified that and left.\nWhile waiting for the food to come, a blond woman and what I was told was the owner came in. She was carrying a dog. Ok. I've seen a few bars that allow dogs so that didn't worry me too much. Like most fluffy dogs, it was shedding like a fiend but hey...as long as it didn't go into the kitchen, it's cool.\nOf course, then she took it into the kitchen...where it remained for most of the time we were there!\nIf only there had been a health inspector in the restaurant...but half an hour into this mess, still no other customers. \nAfter about a 15 minute wait, our food was delivered.\nI will admit that the girl's salad was pretty. Lots of fruit and such on it.\nBut the chicken was boiled in what seems to be plain water and had no taste at all. Nothing...nada...It was ex-chicken.\nMy burrito filling must have been mixed and cooked days or weeks before because I could not identify what meat it was. All I could taste was oil. The sauce on the plate was hardened around the edges, obviously microwaved to death. I don't think they did anything to my food but put it pre-made onto my plate and nuke it. Seriously bad and not spicy (Unless oil is the new chili powder...I admit to a certain heart-burn after the meal).\nIt was a horrible meal and a I would never send anyone there who I liked...or even disliked a bit.\nMaybe a lawyer or politician or something. No actual feeling humans though.\nAnd I'm guessing the dog liked it in the kitchen.",

I'm not even sure there was a shrimp in there.\n- Is Nicki Minaj appropriate dinner music? Unclear.\n- I felt like I was on a date with the people next to us when it got crowded.

My first TD experience was in my teens, and I didn't return until my late twenties.  Seriously, what is wrong with me?!  Some people will talk about Mr. Wizard's or Andy's.  Hell, even Culver's has good custard, but Ted Drewe's will always be the custard king, no competition.\n\nNow, one problem I have with the Dutchtown location is its seasonal hours.  I'm not entirely sure that it has an official opening date every spring.  In fact, there might be some subjectivity to it.  I always forget about it, and then one day it's open.  I try to go there in the fall, and then it's closed.  \n\nNo offense to the Chippewa store, but Dutchtown is where it's at!  The lines are always much more manageable.  Some people are not as comfortable in the neighborhood.  We often call them County Folk.  The quality is just the same, and actually easier to get to from most areas.  The Chippewa location is great, but you wait less and get the same awesome custard.\n\nTwo words:  Strawberry Shortcake.  Get it!",

There's many different sauces to choose from so you have no choice but to return so you can try them all. It's a small, older looking building with a rather small parking lot, but I've never had a problem finding a parking spot, even when they have been busy. The food always comes out in a timely manner, so your mouth won't be drooling too much waiting for those wings. Whether you're grabbing a beer or at a table, this is a casual spot to go to. Don't forget, they have a wing special on Wednesdays! I believe it's 70 cents/ wing. Enjoy!!",

We waited outside sipping water for about 30 minutes while they prepped for dinner service. That was great considering we had been in the sun for hours, so shade & fluids worked perfectly for both of us.\n\nWhile the service was very nice, what didn't work so well for us was the quality of the food, including the fish & chicken. The fish just wasn't very good caliber, including bloodlines in the Yellowtail, plus the chicken was undercooked so much that my friend wouldn't eat it. I worked my way around the reddest parts, but we shouldn't have had to deal with undercooked poultry. She declined to order something else, so we settled the bill and figured it was a lesson learned.",

I actually found it on Yelp and the reviewers were right on the money. This is excellent. \nWe received chips and salsa to snack on while reading the menu. The chips were warm and salty but not too salty. The salsa had a great flavor. I ordered the chicken quesadilla. It came with a guacamole salad. The chicken was tender and juicy. The guacamole leaned more to the creamy side. Sometimes quesadillas can be bland but the chicken had been marinated, slow cooked, and shredded into chunks. Because it was had so much flavor you didn't really need to add anything to it but I can't pass up guacamole. \nMy mom had a poblano pepper and couldn't quit raving about it.  Everything was very fresh and very delicious. The service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean. It is very easy to give this place 5 stars.",

One look at the gorgeous waitress and said a little prayer hoping for fast, and competent service before I just broke down and started spraying condiments down my gullet in a hungry act of desperation. Thought I could get by, by adding some crab legs to a few wings and possibly some shrimp. Wasn't going to happen. Only got to order five wings-thats it. My man got the other five, and a salad with a couple beers. After a bug-carcass filled beer, and a few wings we realized we weren't getting any more food. Not only could we not order any additional food after the first round, but what we did order would never be delivered to us. Server is AWOL although I can see her just inside the window fixing her face in a Covergirl mirror. Deciding we might sustain our lives by eating the salad we eventually got, it arrived all wrong. We cancel the order and crawl to Pete and Shorty's next door for nutrition. Had a far better experience sans young retarded waitress with coochie cutter shorts and tights that didn't match her skin tone. yay!",

I enjoyed it along with their house made salsa and chips. \n\nWe sat outside, which by the way, was also another great choice because despite the 40 something degree weather they made sure we kept warm. They setup partitions to keep the cold air out and provided heaters along with very warm blankets to wrap ourselves in. The owner kept coming by our table to check on us and ask if we were warm enough or if there was anything he could do to adjust the temperature. I really enjoyed my first experience at this establishment and I will be returning very soon.",

  "text": "The menu at Drago's claims that the charbroiled oysters are the best bite of food one can find in NOLA.  Well, after eating my way through much of New Orleans, I wholeheartedly agree.  I've never had oysters before because they always looked slimy and gross in my opinion, but these were amazing.  The garlic, butter, lemon & charbroiled flavors were really a culinary masterpiece!  \nThe dinner I had at Drago's was delicious as well.  I had shrimp ettufee (sp?) and it was great.  My husband had crawfish ravioli that he raved about.\nI would highly recommend Drago's to anyone visiting NOLA.  These oysters are a must!",

  "text": "We were in the Arts district and looking for dinner. Yelp to the rescue. Because of the area - there are many a steakhouse and other pricey options in this neighborhood. We wanted something a little more casual and not so expensive.\n\nSahara totally did the trick. It's a pretty small place, but I knew from the moment we walked it we were in a good location as there was a large group of middle eastern teenagers just hanging out. Another group came in while we were eating.\n\nIt says \"home cooking\" on their sign and I believe it - the food was absolutely delicious, and probably the most authentic I have had. The hummus was so good, very smokey. I got chicken and couscous and it was so yummy! \n\nDecor wise it was average - totally acceptable but nothing to write home about. Only four stars because the service was a little slow, and inattentive. They never asked us how the food was - not once, not even a the end of the meal. So four starts. We would definitely go back!",

High burn with every crunchy morsel. Just below numb on the volcanic scale, perhaps not reaching conflagration due to the meager presence of Szechuan black peppercorns and reliance on red chillies to cover for their absence, but still excellent. \n\nThe Crispy Fish Fillets Sweet & Sour was a large deep platter full of lightly fried fish and loads of orangey thick sauce. More Cantonese, but a strong interpretation. Really liked it in the face of all the other flames. \n\nThe few other plates were good, but not worth taking up more space here in light of all the other fireball delights found in this still surprisingly authentic Chengdu palace.",

  "text": "I took a small team for a special celebration work lunch at Fleming's yesterday. There were 5 of us. The whole experience (with exception of the clumsy valet guy) was exceptional. Service was kind, abundant yet subtle. With the rainy day we started with soup, some had French opinion and others the lobster bisque. Both were very good but the French onion seemed the standout favorite. Four of us had the lunch special which comes with choice of salad, choice of steaks or salmon and half a side (still a large and shareable amount). The salads are large and very good. We had Caesar and wedge salads (not the only options). The wedge was so large that we each had half and took the rest to go. Both salads were covered in high end ingredients, very fresh with delectable dressings. The bread service of warm sourdough rolls with spreads (one and onion, red wine spread and the other a butter, ricotta spread) was refilled several times for us. \n\nOur steaks were high quality, cooked exactly as asked, tender and flavorful. The filets were served on a smattering of wonderful sautéed mushrooms and drizzled with a mild, thin blue cheese sauce. The strip steak had Brussels sprouts and a side of glaze. One of our party had the seafood Cobb salad with large shrimp and crab, and an abundance of other toppings like egg, blue cheese and glazed nuts.\n\nEverything was excellent with the whole lunch exceeding expectations and my people feeling very pampered - which was the whole point. Service, again, was wonderful. I highly recommend. I read earlier reviews from when they first opened that seemed unimpressive but I experienced that they have worked out the kinks and are performing very well.",

  "text": "VERY CLASSY ! My wife found us this great place ( under $300 ) to stay overnight in Santa Barbara recently ( as she always does wherever we travel in the world ). We arrived quite late to check in at around 6.40pm on Thursday and Ryan the hotel manager / reception clerk was very kind to us. The Eagle Inn ( boutique hotel - bed & breakfast ) offers a variety of accommodation options and my wife had booked one of the private Casitas - \"San Clemente\" which featured a separate living room with a large screen TV over a double-sided gas fireplace connected to the bedroom, a huge spa bath in the bedroom plus an amazing fully appointed ensuite with rain shower + regular shower. Ryan noticed that we had expensive electric bikes on the hitch rack of our Tesla Y and offered us free overnight storage in the hotel's lock up garage ( where they stored hotel supplies ). Our ground floor private Casita was fully appointed with everything you might need such as Cable TV with free movie channels, high-speed internet connection, air-con, coffee maker, refrigerator, direct dial phone with voice mail, personal in-room safe, iron & board, microwave oven, AM/FM radio, hair dryer. Parking in the hotel's private lot was free. Ryan also reminded us the hotel provides a complimentary hot breakfast in the hotel's dining room ( at present on the dining room's outdoor patio due to covid restrictions ) or delivered to our Casita. What impressed us the most about our beautiful suite..everything worked perfectly...every switch we touched every button we pushed. The bathroom was amazing...totally pristine ! There was also a small private patio outside the living room. After getting our overnight luggage inside and wheeling our eBikes into the hotel garage we settled down on the sofa in the living room. We turned on the large screen TV over the double sided fireplace and enjoyed our dinner ...delicious gourmet empanadas from Buena Onda which we picked up on the way here. I poured myself an ice cold Almanac Love Hazy IPA and we watched the baseball world series. Dessert was a slice of heavenly Seven Layer Chocolate Cake we bought for lunch. The huge whirlpool Spa bath looked totally inviting but we were too pooped. The luxurious king size bed was totally comfortable and our sleep was not disturbed by any unwanted noises. The idea of a complimentary hot breakfast was enticing...in fact we checked out the hotel dining room as we left and breakfast looked outstanding. Ryan had told us we could retrieve our eBikes from the hotel garage after 8am so we did that first thing on Friday morning with the assistance of lovely reception clerk Cerese. Oh...and hotel guests are offered free use of bicycles. Everything about this beautiful hotel which is very close to the beach impressed us. We hit the road early at 8.30am for breakfast at one of our fav restaurants ( Jeannine's Restaurant & Bakery ) in Montecito. We'll be back for sure !",

Do not forget to ask your server for a vocher.  This is a big bonus in my book because it is always gracious of a hotel to pick up the valet tab for their customers.  \n\nThe menu and decor both celebrates traditional Southern cuisine, however it didn't come off as upscale to me.  The menu and decor comes off as thoughtful, well planned with a side of kitsch.  Mason jars make up a majority of the decor.  The rich browns and clean lines make for a relaxing dinning room.  There is a private dining area on the side for larger groups (so keep that in mind yelpers if you are hosting a fun event).  I loved the bar menu, it was a leather bound booklet with a very beautiful picture of a rabbit on it.\n\nI started with the Peach Old Fashioned.  They infuse makers mark with peaches.  The house made hop bitters cut through the sweetness of the peaches making for a well balanced drink.  My friend tried the House Made tonic and gin.  The tonic had a bit of an earthy taste to it.  Once the cocktail was completed, the biggest win was it was Wine Wednesday.  Half price bottles of wine (yes please).\n\nThe appetizer selection was good.  They were out of oysters, but I lived!  The crab corndogs are so good and the jars were a great complement.  I loved the pimento cheese and pepper jelly.  For dinner, I had the Chicken Gallatine with spicy collard greens and a turnip green puree.  All the flavors blended together beautifully and the chicken was very tender.  The Halibut and the Mason's burger were all enjoyed at the table.\n\nLastly, the Elivs dessert was the best.  I am of firm belief that dinner should be chocolate, upon more chocolate with chocolate and chocolate, plus some ofther stuff.  So that being said, dark chocolate mousse, with a bacon white chocolate brittle, peanut butter and bananna jam could have been my 1st, 2nd and 3rd course.",

They even have a case full of rhinestone crowns, if you are really feeling regal and want to add some fancy head gear to your collection.\n\nThe shop owner was very sweet and asked if I needed help and informed me of the items that were for sale. I didn't purchase anything this time, but I do really want a fancy tiara, so I will eventually be back.",

I went in and I ordered a Black and Gold crunch in a waffle cone. It was sooo good. \n\nAlthough it's not gelato, the atmosphere of the place reminded me a lot of Brocato's with the atmosphere and decor. I guess it's the next best thing to Brocato, if you can't make it uptown. I think that this place is one of those NOLA \"musts\".",

  "text": "The Red Ox Inn is a first-class fine dining experience in an understated, comfortable atmosphere. The vintage sign out front indicates that the Red Ox Inn has existed in some form for years, but the interior and menu indicate that the proprietors are forward-thinking.\n\nLocated in a small storefront in the Strathearn neighbourhood, the general ambiance is that of a clean, high quality neighbourhood restaurant, accented by white tablecloths and hardwood floors.\n\nThere are maybe about ten tables in total, but spaced well apart from each other. The restaurant isn't too quiet, but not too loud either. You can converse easily and listen to some carefully picked mid-tempo indie rock tunes in the background.\n\nNaturally, the food is the star here. The focus is on great flavor and great texture while still presenting the food in a unique way.\n\nIn our party of four, three ordered the (Vegetarian) green pea, hazelnut, and white chocolate soup as an appetizer and everybody loved it. I had a little taste and concur.\n\nI went for the beet salad with goat cheese and received a completely new interpretation of an old favourite. Instead of larger beets cut into rounds, this was served with small, halved beets instead. This salad, while tasty, didn't wow me the way the soup did.\n\nBut the pheasant I ordered as a main did. The bird was cooked perfectly, complete with crispy skin. I also appreciated the romesco that they served with it. I'm a sucker for romesco.\n\nDessert was also warm, awesome and delicious. Service was non-intrusive and efficient - just the way I like it. And while Red Ox Inn doesn't officially serve bread, we asked for some to sop up the soup and they provided us with some delicious, and buttered, rye bread to do so.\n\nIf you are looking for a refined, fine-dining experience in Edmonton, you will not go wrong with the Red Ox Inn.",

But I was exhausted and the idea of a drive thru appealed to me. \n\nI had a salad at home that I'd put together and just wanted a whole chicken. That was the first thing that surprised me about Boston Market. There is no just buying a whole chicken. You can get a half chicken and it comes with 2 sides. Since it was just for me and my grandma, I thought that would be just fine. \n\nWhat I didn't realize is that it's a dinner for one. It really was enough for the two of us, especially with the salad I already had at home. But neither of us cared for the chicken, at all. It has a strange flavor to it. Doesn't even compare to the grocery store rotisserie chickens. Their green beans and red potatoes were good. The roll just looked funky and neither of us wanted it. \n\nThe gal that took our order was very friendly and the line moved at a decent speed. But the chicken...just terrible.

This massive warehouse of randomness exists? WHAT IS THIS PLACE!?!? It seems pretty dated, and kind of sad. I don't see Kmart lasting much longer, but then again, there are always people inside buying things, so I suppose they are doing alright.\n\nLast time I was here, I bought a hula hoop for dog-training class. It was cheaper than expected. Before that, a beach umbrella that never really worked. I can usually trust that all the cheap random items that I don't feel like trekking out to Walmart for will be here. Last year, they offered a Mother's Day special on Arbor Mist wine and chocolates... ratchet as that is, I plan on taking advantage of that deal this time around. As for the food, I'll probably skip it and go next door.\n\nSide note, the check out cashier was not friendly. She didn't appreciate my attempts at communication. I have however have nice experiences with some friendly senior employees who were very helpful and personable. That's probably one of the only positives to this store.",

They are good about including vegetarian options, too.  The buffet comes with naan.  We've gone for dinner a time or two as well, and enjoyed everything.  Between the buffet and dinner I know we've tried the tandoor platter, palak paneer, baingan bharta (eggplant-- to die for), the aforementioned chicken, tamarind chutney, regular and garlic naan, rice pudding, and mango lassi, with not a bad option on the list.",

It has a Bohemia quality to it reminiscent of places I've been to in Toronto and Montreal that survive despite the mad sweep of chain shops like Starbucks. The smells in this place are mouthwatering - homemade Indian fare including samosas with a tangy dipping sauce, just referred to reverentially as \"The Sauce\" by staff and regulars, that's to die for. The Chicken chana masala in a wrap was so good I've dreamt about it that night! The chef and owner Zee Zaidi is super friendly, and the full windowfront exposure and sidewalk patio are great for people watching; or just sit back and enjoying a pistachio chai latte (it has over 30 different spices in it!) and laugh with your friends at the road-ragers racing by. Life seems to slow down here. Grab a table or comfy couch to lounge or linger on. Beer's flowing on tap and a wide selection of bottled imports are available. Don't miss the case of tantalizing desserts with wacky names like \"I Don't  Usually Do This...\" and \"Desserts is Stressed Spelled Backwards.\" A remedy for your sweet tooth, hungry belly, beer- and good-times cravings.",

Given that I my roots are from the south of India, I must say that I tend to have very high expectations for the dosa clan of food items which is quite different from North Indian food (naans etc.)\n\nNow, what I have tried I really ilke.  They make an awesome Himalayan chai which is green in color.  Strongly infused with crushed pistachios, extremely flavorful and filling.  It's caffeine free too.  It's really more like flavored milk.   I also like some of the other things out there.  They have a large variety of tea bags that you can pick up for your hot tea.\n\nRemedy has some seriously filling muffins etc. to go with tea/coffee for those just looking for the cafe experience.  Mostly whole grain muffins with high fiber and filling as hell, it's great for an afternoon break from work kind of thing.  I like 'em.\n\nThe food looks very good, to be honest.  I can't wait to try some of the things.  Dosa is one, but even some of the more traditional north indian varieties look pretty good.  Another review will appear, once I've tried the food!",

Little things like the water, fans and fireplace did not work along with the TV having almost nothing you can watch. At this price point, cable and good linens are a must. Nothing you can do about the old inn part and that's part of the charm. With just a little more attention to detail and care this could be a fabulous place.

  "text": "I want to preface this review by saying that I have had a number of great experiences at Kanella from before they moved to their not-so-new location to now. However, our last experience, from the service to the food, was oddly subpar.\n\nI arrived at 8:28pm for an 8:30pm reservation and checked in with the maitre d'. At the time, she informed me that the table was ready and that I could be seated if I wanted. However, I decided instead to wait for the rest of my party, who had informed me that they were almost there. They arrived at 8:39pm. At that point, we went up to be seated and were informed that our table was not ready and that it would be a \"few more minutes\" - somehow, our table had disappeared. We ended up waiting until 9:07pm to be seated with no explanation as to what had happened.\n\nHonestly, if that had been the only issue, it would have been fine. However, the food had some glaring issues too. Two members of our party ordered the poussin special. The first time the dishes arrived, they were completely overcooked to the point that they were almost impossible to cut, and were painfully over-salted. One member of the party just gave up on his dish and just shared half of mine - the pork osso bucco, which while edible, was served in a very acidic yet creamy sauce that probably had too much lemon juice in it. The other member sent her poussin back, and it came back still too salty, but at least cooked correctly.\n\nThe service was also chaotic - some of our appetizers arrived quickly while one of them took such a long time, we had to ask if they'd forgotten it. They also gave us a salad we had not ordered, and when we asked them about it, the waiter just waved his hand exasperatedly and said, \"just keep it\". When the server brought out the poussin the first time, he spilled a bit of the sauce off the plate onto the seat (luckily not onto the clothes of the diner!). \n\nI'm not sure if they were short-staffed that night or something - the whole experience was just so jarringly different from all the times I've been there in the past. It was also particularly disappointing as it was my sister's last meal in Philadelphia so we had picked Kanella to celebrate - and by the end of the meal, we did not even opt to order dessert. They did give us a free baklava to go - which was very tasty - and two out of three appetizers were delicious, so I'm hoping our next visit will erase this particular meal like a bad dream.",

  "text": "Mmmmm, kwesadila.....Went to Global Quesadilla for a quick n easy dinner on Sunday night.  Good stuff.  Not your stereotype cheesyn tortilla, but something totally different.\n\nStarted with chips and queso.  That's a lotta chips and queso for $4.79!  Chips are thin and crispy.  Very generous portion of hot cheese.  Not plain white queso, but some type of cheddar and other mix.  I really liked it.  A good semi-strong flavor, that wasn't just based on spice.\n\nI got the Aztec quesadilla with aztec sauce on the side, wife and daughter split a florentine with added chicken (and red sauce came on the side).  They all come with a helping of shredded lettuce that you can put on yourself.\n\nSince we were eating in (I like to get out of the house to eat), it was all fresh off the grill and very hot.  I have been here before, but forgot that these aren't just a bunch of cheese other toppings mixed in.  It's really a balance of all the items with the cheese.  So if you're wanting a big cheese explosion, it's not for you.  But if you want a variety of flavor in your Q, then this is for you.  My daughter said theirs was like a pizza, which she liked.  My Aztec is hard to describe, but I like it.  Mix of chicken, cheese, taco-sauce like spice, bacon (that I couldn't really taste - so that was a bit of a downer).  The menu describes it a sweet and spicy.  I think that's accurate.  Overall, Global Q is a good, different flavor experience.\n\nDecor is pretty spartan.  That's not a knock, just how it is.  It's really just a delivery or quick-casual joint.  Workers were friendly, place was very clean.",

Coming as a surprise to no one, it's quite busy during that time. The speed of the service suffered as a result, but the food was as good as expected.\n\nI ordered the Four Cheese Garlic Bacon Burger with Tater Tots which is very good, but the Garlic is strong! No one will be encouraged to kiss you and vampires will be sure to avoid you for the rest of the day.\n\nBecause it was lunch I did not order any of the \"Adult Shakes\" or try any of the Beers, but based on my experience at the other location I have no doubt they are worthy.\n\nI absolutely recommend you stop in Burger Republic",

The fans and water misters were very appreciated on a hot July morning, and the live jazz band added to the ambiance.  It was also nice how there was a short line and plenty of open tables on a Sunday morning (especially compared to Café du Monde...)\n\nUnfortunately, the beignets and coffee here just don't stack up against Café du Monde or even the other Cafe Beignet locations.

They also have other food, like omelettes, sandwiches, and even cocktails, so coming here should please everyone in your group.",

Some of these other froyo establishments don't offer the wonderous topping I discovered at Yogurtland\n2) Price, by weight, you really get your monies worth. I only paid like $3.50 for what would be like $7.00 at a Cold Stone, and my bowl was filled with berries and fruit and froyo!!!!\n\nThat's all I'm really asking for in a froyo place. I guess it's cool, serving yourself, and getting biodegradable spoons too, but really those two things define yogurt for me. \n\nDon't worry Redwood Yogurt of Arcata, your $2.50 Peach homemade waffle cone will always be the best!",

  "text": "We came in right after they opened for the day. They were still mopping the floors which rendered them like a slip-n-slide. I had some shoes with decent traction but I was still sliding around - not safe for any customer and inexcusable since their opening time is not a surprise to them.\n\nIt looked like there was only one server for the restaurant, that being the wife of the owning couple. She amazingly had control of many tables. But when the restaurant got half full, it was obvious she needed extra assistance. She often greeted customers by yelling from across the restaurant when she saw them. I often heard customers wondering what she said.\n\nI ordered the Pad Thai. She asked if I wanted it mild, medium or spicy. I told her mild since I didn't want to mask the flavors with heat. For the record, mild is more like medium. There was a strong heat presence. So, if you are sensitive to spice and like things mild, I would recommend asking for no spice. Then, perhaps you would actually get mild!\n\nThe plating looked odd because there was a mound of noodles topped with chopped green onion on one side of the plate. Then, there was a slightly dried out lime wedge, a pile of thinly spiraled carrot and a pile of chopped peanuts on the other side. It looked like I had asked for Pad Thai with the peanuts on the side! The odd plating aside, the noodles were horribly mushy that they were broken into child-safe lengths. I felt like I needed a spoon to eat it.\n\nOne of the first things we ordered was the Korean fried chicken in soy and garlic. We were told it takes 20-25 minutes. It came out after our main dishes even though we ordered our mains after the chicken; so I would recommend ordering it before sitting down if you can. The dish looked delicious and ate that way too. That was this meal's saving grace. The chicken was crispy but thoroughly coated with glaze. Wing size was pretty decent and the restaurant comes with a handwashing station so you can eat with abandon, lick your fingers and go wash your hands before eating anything else.\n\nAs with driving a new car out of the dealership lot, the Korean fried chicken immediately depreciates in value (crispy value, that is) when taken to-go. So, I would recommend dining in for your first KFC experience.\n\nThe Korean fried chicken is the only reason to come to this place. Just be sure to wear some slip resistant shoes!",

What can I add to this review that could possibly help out the readers to know that this is the one place to go for your anytime desert or sweet tooth fix! My family and I drive from across the valley just to go here for an evening treat. And I've never failed to find someone else in the shop that I know. It's not overly crowded but always very satisfying. The store was decorated for Halloween this last visit and each time you opened the front door, a giant spider descended from the ceiling to frighten the unsuspecting guest at the counter. The staff are exceptional at fulfilling special requests, such as I'd like my sundae with a scoop of peanut butter on the bottom of the dish and another on the top, but no nuts please... I have a nut allergy. Okay so I made up the nut allergy part but they did do the peanut butter thing exactly the way I wanted it. The popcorn and candies there are also another hyper child's dream! They will have you wanting to comeback again and again for more delectable goodies. I do believe my dentist also endorses their business. Maybe they should start selling toothpaste and brushes too!?!",

Back then, I always chose the Carolina Chicken Salad or the Chicken BLT.\n\nYesterday, I branched out with the Spinach Dip and Classic Quesadilla -- which, I believe, is a new item. It came highly recommended from our [super friendly] server.\n\nUnfortunately, both dishes fell short, especially the quesadilla. But what can you expect from a chain? I was also very annoyed because of the noise level. We should have sat around the bar because I have a low tolerance for screeching/crying. I know it can't be avoided, but geesh.\n\nAlso know that their beer list sucks. They listed off \"Bud, Coors, Miller, Forgotten Boardwalk\" to the tables next to me, and then I overheard the server say, \"Forgotten Boardwalk's Funnel Cake is similar to an IPA\" and might have choked to myself. Aaaand Stone's Ruination is a stout, right? [/beernerd]\n\nBut yeah, Ruby's is what you'd expect. Stick to the regulars and the salad bar.",

Each time I walk in, I am taken back with how pretty the restaurant is, which I noticed is very similar to all of their other locations (I was stalking their website with the 360 degree photos the other day). I love the cute little booths that are tucked away and the seating in the middle is really fun, and not as uncomfortable as I initially thought it would be since you are so close to other diners. All of the tacos have been yummy, the fries are beyond tasty, and the cocktails have been yummy, too. I recently tried the quesadilla salad, and it was just as satisfying. We usually have really great servers. The lunch portions are satisfying and priced right - better than dinner, in my opinion. This is definitely my lunch go-to while downtown. Ooh, and my favorite bonus when I picked up a to-go order a few weeks ago - the bag is reusable and CUTE!",

The food is on the spicier side but it's all very well done and very tasty.  My husband likes how they change up the buffet menu every day so it's different every time we go.

  "text": "My husband and I spent a long weekend at the Eagle Inn in the Santa Catalina cabin at the end of January 2012.  We had an amazing time and the Eagle Inn was exactly what we expected and more.  \n\nThe staff was friendly, professional, and effective--maybe not the warmest, gushing, cuddly types but the got the job done and made us feel happy and welcome.  \n\nThe Inn grounds were very clean and in excellent repair with a tasteful and comfortable decor.  Our room was even better!  \"Cozy\" doesn't even begin to cover how lovely and wonderful the room was!  Immaculate and clean.  We loved the fireplace (yes it was electric but, come on....its southern California!) the dual head shower was...um...inspiring, and the whirlpool tub was also perfect.  We were delighted to find that the tub actually lights up!  hahaha!  The bed was ultra-fluffy and very comfortable...so comfortably that we kept sleeping in past our usual 5am wake up.  I guess that's the point of a vacation :)\n\nThe location was ideal.  Two blocks from the beach and lovely stroll at that.  The electric trolly is about a 2-3 minute walk so we never had to drive the whole weekend.  The Harbor is an easy 10 minute walk and so is the Pier.  What we really liked about the location is that the Inn's area is so quiet and peaceful but close enough to the \"action\" of State Street.\n\nBreakfast was great!  There was more than enough for the both of us to get our morning fill.  The hot entrees were well prepared and tasty.  I also loved how they included lots of extra little treats, snacks, and goodies in the room--chocolates, biscotti, chips, apples, and bottled water.  We paid extra for the champaign and chocolate dipped strawberries--a dozen roses and rose petals all over the place.  If we were to break down the economics of the package ($75) it might not be worth it.  Yes, I'm a coupon clipper and very frugal but I have to say that it was a nice addition and would do it all over again :)",

It was delicious and our favorite entree!\n\nAlthough it is pricey and parking is only valet (make sure you get it validated so it's only $5 instead of $40!), the inside is nice and it's great for a special occasion.\n\nMain complaint: It's really cold in there :(",

  "text": "Crazy sushi is open for its second week.  Stopped in for lunch, and there was no one else there.  They have a pretty extensive menu, lots of options besides sushi.  They have a few different lunch specials including 3 rolls for 12.  This is $1 more than the other sushi lunch specials in the area, but no big deal.  At first glance, they have a lot of options for the 3 roll special plus soup or salad, a list of 43 different rolls.  I went with spicy tuna, Alaska, and spicy scallop, plus a salad.  The waitress came back and said spicy scallop isn't included, I said it was on the list, and she said that was a mistake, so I requested the crabmeat apple.  I got brown rice for all of them.  She arrived with the sushi, and instead of crabmeat apple she had given me apple avocado.  I pointed that out, and she took the sushi away so they could make the correct roll.  She came back and my crabmeat apple was actually imitation crabmeat apple.  That's really not what I wanted, and there was no way for me to know it was going to be the fake crab, so I just didn't eat that roll.  It should say crabstick not crabmeat.\n\nThe spicy tuna was good, not too much mayo, and my Alaska roll had a decent amount of fish.  All the fish seemed fresh.  \n\nBill came, it's a 75 cents up charge per roll for brown rice, but 15% off right now because of the grand opening.  I'm willing to give it another chance, but considering they just opened and should be wanting to impress customers so that they return, especially when Vic's, Machi, and Tsuki, are a few blocks away, I was underwhelmed.",

  "text": "I'm a big, gigantic fan of Mexican food.  I eat it often, and when I do, I almost always choose authentic over any alternative.  When I do choose the alternative, I have low expectations.  Nada, a relatively new addition to the Indy restaurant scene, is one of those restaurants that I classify as such.  However, with its uber-rave reviews, I was excited to try it when the situation presented itself.  Would it live up to the hype?  I don't know about that...\n\nNada is a New Mexican restaurant in the truest sense.  The food is identical to popular fare served in Santa Fé, NM (a city that is wonderful to its core), but would seem foreign in places like Mexico City or even Cancun, Mexico.  It's hipster Mexican, and that's all there is to it.  With that said, the bright ambiance of the restaurant is enough to earn return customers.  Being open, colorful, and quite loud, it arouses the senses - including taste.\n\nNada features a small menu that caters to a broad variety of tastes.  Those with carnivorous, omnivorous, or vegetarian preferences won't have difficulties finding something tasty to eat. While the fare is centered around tacos, there are plenty of other dishes to enjoy.  I recommend group dining and sharing at Nada, as choosing one item is too limiting.\n\nI started my meal by sharing the quesadilla \"taco\" salad, which, if eaten in its entirety, is a meal-sized portion.  It was a creative take on the taco salad, with the quesadilla replacing the crispy shell.  It came with a very heavy amount of spicy avocado dressing.  No one should dine at Nada without having the mac n' cheese.  While the portion appears small on arrival, the diner will take note of the richness and density of the dish.  After one bite, I don't think many will question why it has won city-wide awards.  While I was most excited to try the braised chicken enchiladas, I must report my dissatisfaction.  I found them to over overly salted, which is a water-retaining annoyance.  For a dish with the word, \"chicken,\" in its name, I was led to believe that there would be a decent amount of the bird in it.  How much chicken was there?  Almost nada.  \n\nThe tacos at Nada deserve a paragraph of their own.  While small -  and frankly, overpriced, they pack a lot of flavor.  Of the three I tried, I am unable to name a favorite.  The grilled salmon taco, with its jalapeño corn pico, is very \"Santa Fé.\"  The pork belly, evidently the restaurant's most popular taco, packs a rich a nicely spiced flavor.  It is the most savory taco I have ever eaten.  The mu shu certainly puts an Asian twist on the typical pork taco, and it was the most creative selection on the menu.\n\nOne could easily dine a Nada for dessert alone.  Don't leave the restaurant without trying the churros - a made-to-order cinnamon doughnut.  My God.  The small batch gelatos (not made in-house) are an honorable mention.  I had the pleasure of trying a Habanero chocolate, which as the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.\n\nLike most of the food, the service at Nada was top-notch.  Our server was friendly and quick, even with a packed house and difficult guests (like me).  Bravo to her.\n\nSkip the enchiladas, but don't skip Nada!  While it did not quite live up to the hype, it is a place I would consider returning.",

  "text": "After trying ACME's and Drago's charbroiled oysters, I came to the conclusion that ACME's oysters are better, but this comes to a close second and definitely worth a try also. We ordered a dozen of the charbroiled oysters, jambalaya, alligator bites, and bread pudding. The reason why I do not like the charbroiled oysters here so much is because they seem to have more of a natural taste. It is gritty with tastes of sand in it and I find the buttery sauce with cheese to be too liquidy. I would prefer it to be more melted and on the dry side. But because of this, you can definitely taste the oysters. The jambalaya is also on the wet side, pretty tasty. Bread pudding was delish. I wasn't a huge fan of the alligator bites as I find it to be pretty mediocre. It almost tasted like fried chicken with it being deep fried. Come for the oysters!\n\nService was quick and attentive.

The bartender was friendly and warned me that they don't use fresh mint, they use their own mint syrup.  \n\n$5 cocktails and a seat to watch a local jazz band play?  Sure, I'll take it!  The drinks were decent, but not worth ordering a second.  They're making their money off of the people who want to sit and listen to the band play.  You can get some great pictures and virtually free entertainment here.\n\nSince I'd had a few cocktails prior to this, I needed water.  I went back up to the bar and asked for a cup of water.  A waitress, who didn't bother looking up from her phone, curtly told me they only serve bottled water.  I think the bartender would've given me the water, if the waitress wasn't there, just judging by the expression on her face.  I asked how much the water was, and again not looking up, the waitress mumbled, \"two dollars.\"  \n\nThat was my last impression of Cafe Beignet, because we left promptly after that.  \n\nBeing on Bourbon Street, it's hard to miss.  And being in the center of everything, it's still worth a visit.  Order a cocktail or some coffee, listen to the band, and then GTFO.",

  "text": "I guess its all about definition. Just how you define the food you have on your menu, how you as the patron define your expectations. I've lived in Italy a fair amount, starting back in 1990 and at times for a few months at a time and usually in Florence so I've had a little experience with Tuscan food which by definition is simple, fresh and well made. Ok here's the deal, straight up before I get into particulars, this is a great place for people who have never been to Italy, have no idea what Tuscan food really is and are generally afraid to eat anywhere inside the 1-170 inner belt. Now for the particulars. I ordered a Beefsteak Florentine (I found it cute they used the Italian word for Beefsteak on the menu), I asked for it RARE, like I made a point of it (it was medium at best). What I got was delivered by the food runner as \"here's your strip steak\", I replied, no I ordered the Beefsteak Florentine and he disappeared only to return with the water who said \"in the back they both come up as the same. My friends, a Strip Steak is NOT the same, Beefsteak Florentine is almost always a T bone, charred on the outside and very rare inside, often but not always served on a bed of arugula. It was also not rare by any way, but as my dinner  guests were into their meal, I did not send it back. Also the meat was served with mashed potatoes which I presume is for the West of I-170 clientele who prefer their food really worked over. My fellow companions ordered the lobster ravioli and shrimp which was very rich which is good but it was just too much. This place should just be more honest about their menu and say its Italian-American fusion for upscale people who like to shop at Sacks Fifth Ave and pay too much for everything(interestingly enough, this place is located in the parking lot of an upscale mall). The service was also not so great, we had to ask for more water for the table and the service in general could only be described as spotty. the bar service was also a bit disappointing, my wife Bellini was closer to an adult smoothie than a Bellini and the waiter seemed to not know what kind of gin the bar stocked.  All in all a disappointing meal that was over priced for what you got. On the plus side the Quattro Bruschetta was very good and I thought the only bright spot on the table.",

  "text": "Amazing sushi, service and staff!! My boyfriend and I went here because we had a groupon. We ordered a soup, at least 5 rolls, and a dessert, and the bill was only $50 (without the groupon). \nWe walked in and were seated right away. The sushi presentation was phenomenal, I've never seen something like that in the city. Every roll we had was delicious, i honestly couldn't pick a favorite. I would have kept eating if I didn't get so full. The staff was attentive and our water was always full.\nThe only downside was dessert. We ordered a tempura banana dessert. It's was so so sooo bland. We ended up just eating the green tea ice cream (delicious) that came on the side. \nI will definitely be back. They had unique, absolutely delicious rolls, I can't wait to be back.",

However, this park has been completely taken over by vagrants, and it's sad. What used to be a beautiful place to excercise, study, or just get some fresh air, has become a place for vagrants to urinate, bathe in the fountains, and even have sex (something I witnessed while attempting to take a walk).  Since 2012, protesters also seem to love to crowd the sidewalks and common areas of the park and disturb the peace during family events. It's very disheartening.",

  "text": "I know they're closing the Philly location so this review is kind of pointless but we had a fantastic meal here last night and typing about it will help me relive the delectable flavors so here we go. \n\nI had an unused giftcard for this cute lil BYO from 2013 (unsure how I let that happen), so when I read online that they would be closing I went into a panic and immediately booked a reservation for 4 for Sunday night. I will say there was some confusion surrounding my party size and reservation time, but let's just chalk that up to a last-weekend-open snafu. No biggie.\n\nFirst of all, you had me at BYO. The restaurant was empty upon arrival, and my boyfriend and his parents and I were seated nearest the kitchen. I liked the clean and simple look of the place. Our wine and water glasses were consistently full, and our waitress offered to answer any questions that we might have had about the menu (it's kind of an intimidating menu, to be honest). The menu is designed to be a flight of 3 courses, but we each went with 2 and had plenty of food to share amongst the four of us. The parker house rolls that were brought out at the beginning of the meal were delicious and fluffy. This is turning into a 50 pager (South Park, anyone?) so I'll try to keep it short from here on out. Just note though- this is no cheap date. 8 plates ran us about 200 dollars.\n\n-Asparagus risotto: 5 stars\n-Spring soup: 5 stars\n-Bass: 5 stars\n-Steak: 4.5 stars\n-Pasta with ragu: 4.5 stars\n- Mackarel: 4.5 stars \n-Chicken: 4 stars \n\nNot only were these plates delicious, fresh, and filling, but the presentation was downright artistic. Beautiful job.\n\nWe were too full for dessert but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, since I expected this to be one of those \"let's charge 30 dollars a plate for a portion appropriate for a 5 year old of some fancy food that no one knows how to pronounce\" places.",

  "text": "Three stars is defined by \"A-OK: according to Yelp*\nFour-stars is \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"\n\nYou can believe what you want but, this place is better than K-Mart, not in volume or variety but, in customer service... and also because it is a more affordable experience.  I know that I could post plenty of photos that prove that but, I'll save that for K-Marts wake up call on their review (eventually).  \n\nI like this place for a few things especially when I frst return from deployments.  I usually toss all my old spices and reboot here.  Seasonal decor has always been one of my big draws here and they have this huge sale...  I am not sure how many times a year but, it is on everything in the store.  I purchased a wonderful pots and pan set here (the biggest one I could find - teflon, silicone handles, glass lids, red in color - and it has served me well for almost 4 years now).\n\nThe furniture here is not Haverty's... That is why there is a Haverty's.  This is on par with the big box stores like Target, Walmart and the dreaded Kmart. They have a decent company buyer because it is obvious that Big Lots is trying to stay atop the latest in thing   E for effort there!\n\nIn the store I met Sandy. She approached me and asked if I needed any assistance.  I thanked her and said that it had been a while since I had visited this store, so I was simply browsing.  When I reconnected with her later, I asked her about an item, she was kind enough to walk me to the location where it was shelved.  How nice, right?  Yes, that goes a long way with me.  Thanks Sandy.",

  "text": "A few friends and I went to Ellington's before a show at TPAC this week, and there were definitely some things I liked about it! But there also things I didn't.\n\nThe good? Their happy hour has GREAT prices. A lot of happy hours in Nashville kind of suck? This one doesn't. Seriously discounted prices. All cocktails on their menu were half off. One house red (a red blend) and one house white (a pinot grigio) were half off. And all their beers were half off. HALF OFF. They had $2 oysters, and ALL THEIR STARTERS WERE $5. These are some real discounts. \n\nMore good? The service was good. The wine and the cocktail I had were good. The restaurant is beautiful. Very Donald Draper walking in for a few martinis over his lunch hour. And it's really close to TPAC. There aren't that many dinner options walking distance to TPAC, so another option is good. I'm not huge at sweating through a nice meal, so you won't catch me on a patio until late September but for those of you who like to sweat and or don't sweat - they have a beautiful patio as well. \n\nThe not so good? We decided to try ALL the starters (there are 7 of them) since they were all $5 (there were four of us). While some were better than others, only one really knocked my socks off. Here's what we had: warm olives with orange zest, roasted garlic and brioche (good, but it turned out that two of our party don't eat olives, and the other two of us coudln't eat the 100 olives that were in that bowl! way too many); piquillo peppers with queso fresco and chimichurri (okay); roasted cauliflower with togarashi spice, split pea puree, and ponzu (this wasn't a hit at our table); picked deviled eggs (this was the one - the one that impressed a lot - despite the fact that I'm not a deviled egg eater generally!); cheese curds with green goddess (okay - sort of bland cheese that could have been string cheese rather than a real cheese curd and I wouldn't be surprised); pork loin with white bbq sauce (I think that was the least favorite at our table - the pork seemed really dry and tough and bland); and a cold shrimp dish (I can't describe this one, because it wasn't on the menu, but it was one of the better starters in my opinion; the 7th starter on the menu was a feta with olive oil, thyme, and watermelon, but that's not what we got; all of our group ate shrimp, but I think they probably should have let us know that one of the dishes was different than on the menu). Overall, the food was okay at best. I was certainly happy with the cost ($35 for all 7), but the food definitely wasn't good enough that I'd be excited to eat there for dinner (when entrees range from $20-42). Some of the dishes we had seemed a little too much like bar food for the location and the prices (if weren't happy hour) - cheese curds? In a place as decked out as this? \n\nThe Fairlane Hotel is beautiful (this restaurant is on the 4th floor), but parking in this part of town is practically nonexistent, so you're going to have to valet out front or park in a nearby garage (I was parking for a show at TPAC anyway, so this wasn't such a big deal for me). \n\n(Note: we had a reservation for 4 at 5:30 on a Tuesday evening before Ilana Glazer's double header show at TPAC. We didn't need a reservation. The restaurant was still pretty empty when we left at 6:40.)\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful. And the happy hour is great. I just didn't think any of the food was great unfortunately.",

  "text": "Based on some reviews I was expecting a lot more WOW factor but our experience was pleasant overall.\n\nWe made reservations for a Sunday night and asked to be seated by the window to enjoy the spanning view of the water and sunset. We had a nice table at the end near the bar where the bartender was our server.\n\nWe started with the mozzarella tomato stack and mussels. Both were good but not fantastic. We were also served bread and butter which we dipped in the leftover broth from the mussels. For dinner I had the shrimp risotto which was by far the best thing we ordered here but still a tad too rich to eat all at once. It was delicious and rich with a buttery wine oil on top that separated from the risotto. Mister had the steak which he said was good but fatty and undercooked. Perhaps a tad overpriced as well.\n\nDessert options were tempting but since the rest of our meal had been just good and not great we decided to skip it here. We got some cheap local ice cream at Bo's after our meal and even saw a family there who had been sitting a table away from us at the Pelican. \n\nOverall we would maybe come back or recommend it as a beautiful spot with good food, but it wasn't anything super special. They have a huge brunch that I might be tempted to try sometime but the price is staggering (although relative to what is offered).",

  "text": "We came to try the Prix Fixe and it was surpringly good.  I had the prime rib, which was juicy, fatty, and flavorful - just as a good prime rib should be; I can't stand overdone beef..  Was it the best ever?  Not quite but it was still tasty and definitely satisfying.  To be completely honest, the crab cakes are probably the better pick, with plenty of lump crabmeat, but sometimes you just really want artery-clogging steak.  The clams casino appetizer was flavorful with plenty of actual clam meat, and the creamed spinach side was on par with that found at any other steakhouse.  The creme brûlée dessert was okay but nothing special: it was creamy but a little too sweet for my liking.  Service was very attentive and the ambiance was great with leather couches and a baby grand.  Business casual dress though so I wouldn't come in jeans and a T-shirt.  Overall, a good steakhouse with a decently priced and tasty Prix Fixe.  I would definitely come for that again but I'm not sure if the steaks and dishes  are actually amazing enough to warrant the full price.  For that, I would probably head to Del Frisco's or Fleming's.",

They serve flavors you won't find anywhere else and will crave if Nola isn't your hometown. \n\nDon't be foolish, get the sampler and make sure you try the lavender honey, Mexican hot chocolate, and green fairy.\n\nThe ice cream scoopers/employees are more than happy to make recommendations which makes this place even more awesome.

The place is local and uses fresh local ingredients and puts out a solid product and adventurous flavors that, if you dar to try, you will be pleasantly surprised.  An almost overwhelming amount of flavors to choose from and many of them are seasonal and use fresh, local seasonal ingredients and there is absolutely no reason to go to a baskin robbins marble slab or any other national chain when you have creole creamery.. and you should hang your head in shame for doing so!\n\nThey have a Tchoupitulas challenge which it just an overwhelming amount of ice cream and there are several people who have actually eaten it.. crazy!  The sundae is available at both locations but the official \"challenge\" can only be done at this one.\n\nIf you want ice cream go to Creole Creamery for a taste of New Orleans at its best.",

  "text": "Kelp Sushi Joint was ok, but there are better sushi options in Tampa.\n\nWe were lured here because the restaurant offers BYOB (bring your own bottle) and they do not charge a corkage fee. Wine glasses and cork screws are provided by Kelp.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the modern décor and appreciated the purse hooks underneath the tables for the ladies I just wasn't a fan of the menu. Most of the rolls were pretty simple (California, Spicy Tuna, Mexican). If I was a timid eater trying out sushi for the first time these rolls may have appealed to me, but in my opinion the rolls were boring. The rolls that were more intricate contained cooked fish, imitation \"krab\" or fried chicken. None of these ingredients appeal to me.\n\nThe sashimi and nigiri options are almost non-existent which raises a huge red flag. My husband could not believe there were no sashimi platters on the menu. When he asked the waitress if the chef could prepare one for us they agreed, but the platter he created only contained tuna, salmon, and rainbow trout. Not much of a variety!\n\nWhile everything tasted fine, nothing \"wowed\" us. We will probably not return, but this is a good spot for people that like very simple or cooked sushi rolls.",

The Sea Urchin was fresh but a bit too much rice.  The combo platter was plentiful and nicely presented.  Good stuff but nothing to blow my socks off.

My mother is Puerto Rican and she is not local, therefore any time I can get some \"homestyle\" cooking I am brought to my happy place. While the restaurant promotes itself as being Dominican, there are many Cuban and Puerto Rican style dishes on the menu. I have ordered the Pollo guisado (Stewed chicken), arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas), arroz blanco con habichuelas (white rice and red beans), pastelitos (fried patties) pargo (snapper), and maduros (sweet plantains).  All very well seasoned!!!  I cannot comment on the dining services because I have ordered takeout each time. The interior of the restaurant is quaint and I look forward to being able to enjoy a dining experience there one day. Keep in mind that they are BYOB. The portions are grand so be prepared and have a heavy appetite. The prices are more than fair. I honestly think they could probably get away with charging a bit more for the size portions that they provide. and I'm definitely not complaining because I appreciate being able to get great quality food at a more than fair price and enjoy several meals from one purchase.  \n\nAnd BONUS! This is a minority-owned small business. I'm all for supporting local small businesses! Wepa!",

  "text": "I had a mixed experience yesterday at this restaurant. My boyfriend and I biked down Esplanade and decided to stop here for lunch. We were hot and wanted air condition so we opted to sit inside. When we first walked in I was surprised to see how small it is. We weren't sure if we should just seat ourselves, so we stood there for a minute until the waitress told us to pick a spot. The restaurant is cute, but it was actually pretty hot in there and we had a few flies flying around us (I guess still better than sitting outside). \nYou get one serving of complimentary chips and salsa, and I really did enjoy the salsa. My boyfriend and I decided to order queso ($7) and a chicken and mushroom quesadilla ($14). My boyfriend loves queso and said that was all he really wanted. However, the queso just wasn't good. That's probably the most expensive queso I've had but may be one of the worst. I also thought they should have brought out another basket of chips with it, since the basket of chips we had with the salsa was pretty small. Since we didn't eat much of the queso, we didn't end up running out of chips until the end of the meal though. My boyfriend was upset and confused on how a place could mess up queso. I promised him that I would split my quesadilla in half with him. The chicken and mushroom quesadilla was delicious!! The mushrooms gave it so much flavor. It was a decent portion, so I didn't mind splitting it with him. However, I think for the price tag it should come with beans and rice too. \nService was a bit spotty, but I believe there was only one waitress and quite a decent amount of tables to serve. A man (maybe a manager) was helping her and ended up talking to us for a bit. He was very nice. Overall, we had a decent experience, and I would come here again for the quesadilla alone because it was seriously that good!",

  "text": "I ordered takeout from their website and I'm so glad I did! I live about a mile from KELP and haven't tried it yet, but I'll definitely go back. Their website was easy to use and my food was ready when I got there, which is exactly when they said it would be ready. I took advantage of the 2 roll deal, which I strongly recommend if you plan on getting multiple fresh rolls and a starter. For $12.95 I chose the ginger salad, salmon avocado roll, and spicy tuna roll. I opted for brown rice on both rolls. The fish tasted fresh and all the veggies were perfect. I was feeling particularly fat today so I also ordered the veggie roll and chicken teriyaki bowl. Veggie roll was so good and the veggies were delightfully crispy. The teriyaki bowl was also very good and I loved all the veggies included in it. I ate so much and still have so much leftover!",

Also, I feel like every time I ask for no cilantro in my pho, they don't deliver my requests. Depending on what time you come here, it may be really rowdy due to the crowds outside, but aside from that, the food comes out fairly quickly, which I can always appreciate. I would recommend Pho Bistro to anyone who enjoys Vietnamese food!",

While that wasn't the case by mid-afternoon, it was considerably less crowded that the Tchop location.  \n\nGreat selection; nicely laid out store; folks offered to help me AND I found everything I needed and was in and out within 30 minutes.

  "text": "To get 5 stars from me, a restaurant needs to be at or near perfection in taste, price, service & ambiance.  After reading the many YELP reviews I put this on the dining list.  I followed the recommendation to arrive BY 5 to avoid long waits.  On a Monday nite, this was not necessary.  There were only 3 tables dining the first hour with 2 additional tables at 6 pm when the first were leaving.  The parking lot is a little confusing beyond the first 4 cars.  The inside of the restaurant is clean and \"fun\" with cow hide tiles along one wall.\n   I had a delicious $25 (7 oz) filet, served with garlic smashed potatoes and a parmesan crusted tomato piece. Prices aren't posted on the online menu nor stated in any other review.  This was the cheapest cut on the menu. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, tho' I ordered medium rare and got rare/cold center.  I did not want to risk sending it back and getting it too done on the other extreme.  I enjoyed the gorgonzola sauce ($4 extra option).  The tomato could come off the menu-it was barely cooked, 2 bites and not flavorful.  The potatoes were good and moist (unlike several photos here) but too garlicky for me.  The first course salad with apples & cranberries was good but not a \"stand-out\".  Hate that they leave such large chunks of lettuce.  The honey balsamic was good but not \"outstanding\".  Loved the light flaky rolls with honey butter--that was a decadent start to the meal.  I ordered at 5:05 and was served the entrée by 5:35 pm.  With a nice malbec, tax and tip, my meal for one was $45.\n   This place has to work through some service issues.  I was seated at the worst spot in the place--in full view of the dumpster when there were many finer places to be seated in the empty restaurant.  There were a dozen employees upon opening for 3 tables. (Good news?  I had a dedicated waiter who served me well.)  But this made for a very LOUD employee party at the bar in a place where music or classy silence might be better than the \"sports bar\" shouting and laughing \"show\".  At least 3 employees were on their phones at any given time--including one of the cooks with one hand on the food prep.  A hostess in flip flops, a bartender whomping her gum, a cook coming out to \"cuddle\" with a female long-haired employee and then go back to food were yucky.\n    I don't mind spending this kind of money.  But I want the total package of \"class act\", which should occur any night of the week consistently with every guest served.",

  "text": "Holy moly sweet jesus guacamole!! Do not eat anything other than the oysters! Order the charboiled oysters.  If you're still not full, order more oysters. If you're still not full from that, order more oysters!!\n\nIn New Orleans, there are many places to eat oysters.  We ate at 3 different places for oysters during our vacation there, and Drago's had the most memorable oysters yet.  It has this buttery-garlic parmesan, romano cheese sauce with it that was to die for. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because that's pretty much the only good thing in the menu.  I went with my family and tried their dishes, and they were alright.  Fish, seafood, fried seafood, steak.  Nothing comparable to the charboiled oysters. But definitely come here when visiting NOLA.  It's at a good location too, next to the pier.  Don't miss out!! And enjoy :)",

  "text": "What a disappointing experience (surprisingly) I had at Lee How Fook.  I'm being generous giving it three stars but I once a few years ago had a decent meal there so I'm rounding up from two stars  Okay, let me explain.\n\nIt was a snowy day in Philly that was turning to rain and I had an early 6:30 theatre curtain with a friend.  I took the train into town and arrived early to meet my friend for dinner only to get a message my friend couldn't make it in time for dinner and would meet me at the theatre.  Ok. I decided to just head up to Lee How Fook on 11th Street and grab a meal there.  I walked in about 5 o'clock - no one else was inside except the staff making dumplings at a back table. They all just looked at me and didn't say a word. I said  \"Are you open?\"  They said yes and I sat down at a corner table.  Finally someone got up and came to me and I ordered the salt-baked squid.  No tea ever came my way - that's a first for me in Chinatown....and it was a cold snowy day outside when tea would have been warming.  The salt-baked squid arrived promptly and it was decent - but by far not the best I have ever eaten.  Unfortunately one of the condiment bottles on the table was so sticky it was actually gross and the hot chili peppers needed a refill.  I exchanged them for the condiments on the empty table next to me.  When I asked for the bill I got it with not even a thank you expressed.  I paid and promptly left and headed into the storm to the theatre where my friend had arrived safely and the play was excellent.\n\nI don't think I will ever eat again in Lee How Fook.  Why would I when there are so many awesome restaurants in Chinatown?",

We were immediately greeted upon entering and offered samples of flavors our eyes seemed to linger on. My daughter settled upon the \"clown\" version -- with lavender and a cookie flavor. Very cute way to decorate ice cream with cone, gummy bears and whipped cream. Our \"scoop specialist\" made it quickly and interacted so well with my daughter while she tried a few flavors. I decided to have the red velvet cake and creole cream cheese. Both very yummy, but I had food envy when I saw someone's brownie Sundae ( definitely my choice next time!) My hubby selected one of the yummy cream soda floats -- very good and generous portion. I was also blown away by the affordability of the menu. Overall, great visit and happy we tried it out. We will definitely return on our next visit to New Orleans! Way to go Creole Creamery.",

I have to say the service was fantastic and made sure that we had everything. \n\nWhen we arrived we were hungry and had heard the pretzel was really good so we ordered a giant pretzel. It came to our table quick and came with sweet mustard and cheese. It was super soft on the inside and tasted wonderful! The mustard was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The cheese was actually a little bit of a let down for me, but others seemed to like it. \n\nI ended up having one of my favorite dishes which was the schnitzel. The schnitzel was pork pounded out flat and then deep fried. It was super good. Others at my table got sausages and they all loved them. \n\nOverall this was a great meal. I would for sure go back and I for sure recommend this place for great German food!",

  "text": "Why I'd opt to go to Rouses over Whole Foods:\n\n1. It's Louisiana-owned\n2. They have Cajun hot nuts\n3. Related to the above, they have an array of other NOLA specialty items (tourists, buy your foodie souvenirs here rather than the FQ)\n4.They play New Orleans music rather than hippy dippy crap\n5. Their employees are nice without making you feel like you've committed a sin by asking for plastic (to be fair, the cashiers at WF aren't nearly as self-righteous as the floor staff who seem like they'd spit on you if you ask for something that is against WF puredom, like artificial sweetener. Not that I'd ever ask for it, but a friend once had the audacity to do so and was met with a lecture).\n6. Kick ass olive bar\n7. They just have a lot more grocery items, and more affordable options at that\n8. Not everything has to be gourmet specialty foods and products. They have those, but sometimes you want a bag of Zapps chips or a harsh cleaning product for eff's sake!\n9. Nowhere nearly as pretentious (for example, you probably don't notice, but WF has plenty of produce that's from Mexico, California and other places).  \n10. Aeroponic rooftop garden! How cool is that?\n11. Phenomenal booze/wine/beer selection\n\nIssues with this particular Rouses that would have me head to WF instead:\n\n1. The oils area is confusing not only to shoppers but to employees as well. I had three different employees attempt to find me a vessel in which to pour truffle oil from the jug thingamajig and no one could help me. Not their fault as apparently they had just changed all that around, but no one clued the staff in. \n2. There's just not enough organic produce. It would be ideal as well, if the organic stuff wasn't all mixed in with the other stuff.\n3. Not enough produce in general (uh, dino kale shouldn't be that rare).\n4. Lack of gourmet whole bean coffee\n\n\nNumbers 2-4 have double weight, as I'm all about the organic produce selection. A fine whole bean coffee i(extremely dark roast that I grind myself) is what gets me through a morning. I realize not everyone is as particular as me, but there you have it. Supermarket shopping is painful enough, I'd rather not have to go to more than one store per week.\n\nOther things to note:\n\n-gourmet and deli sections in this Rouses is really outstanding and similar to WF. I didn't check out the prepared food section too much, so I can't report on that just yet. \n-the staff really did go out of their way to find me an oil vessel. \n-that wine selection blows WF's out of the water\n\nExpect review updates!",

What a mistake.\n\nFirst off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip\nOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.\n\nWhen we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.\n\nI should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",

  "text": "This place was a great find and helped make our trip to New Orleans and Bourbon Street more memorable.  We were only in overnight to do the Bourbon Street \"experience\" (as adults, not college partiers) and then head to a cruise the next morning.  Visiting in late January/Early February it was a bit cool out side, but Cafe Beignet had it covered.  That is, heat lamps.  And despite being a Friday night, it wasn't so crowded that we couldn't get a table near one.  Bonus, some live music playing in the Music Legends Park.  There was an attendant for the tables as well, clearing them as fast as people came and went.\n\nThe Beignet's themselves were good.  I'm not going to say as good as the epic ones located at more famous places around town, but the price and benefit were huge.  And there is a bar adjacent to it for whatever your pleasure if coffee isn't your thing (after all, it is on Bourbon Street)\n\nThe next morning we went back for more, including a reasonable breakfast.  Great since we were on the go and didn't have a lot of time to find a sit down place.  They had a variety of options, including breakfast sandwiches, sweets, just about anything.  And the bar was open too.  If that's something you'd like!\n\nWill be stopping by here for sure next visit, which gets it 4 stars!",

But those two flavors seem to be popular in the yelp review highlights so y'all should ask to sample it at least. The employees are really nice and patient. They let me try like 5 flavors haha",

It's an old school Kroger that feels like it's stuck in the 1980s, but it gets the job done if you're looking for something basic. The layout is a bit odd, and it feels more like a glorified CVS than an actual grocery store. But, it's convenient if you're cruising through Broad Ripple. Find it back by the new Three Sisters location!",

TIP: if you're traveling with more than one person, have them cut the sandwiches two were four slices which is more than enough. Unless you are a professional eater, this sandwich can easily get the best of you.TIP 2: This is the best place to charge your phone at Philadelphia airport.

  "text": "Came here for Sunday brunch and walked away with a very full belly and a good buzz! \n\nTheir brunch buffet includes tons of seafood, an omelet station, pasta bar, carving station, custom sushi rolls, fresh fruit, salads, and the usually breakfast foods you'd expect at a buffet. I almost forgot dessert...an entire side of the room is dedicated to a table full of desserts AND a chocolate fountain. The brunch price also include bottomless mimosas which were literally bottomless. Our server never let us empty our glasses and  the mimosas were very heavy on the champagne, so we all got a bit tipsy. At least the alcohol let us forget how much weight we gained during this meal.\n\nAs if the buffet spread wasn't enough, they also have an a la carte menu with small dishes. The choices included Belgian waffles, french toast, blintzes, Mahi, and a few other savory dishes.  You can order as many of these items as you want, as many times as you want. Our server was sure to remind us of this, she seemed to enjoy watching how gluttonous our table was! \n\nUnfortunately we were here during Tropical Storm Debby, so we didn't get to enjoy a beautiful view of the bay, Although, being here while the weather was so awful was very cozy with the fireplace and wood interior. Thanks to the weather it wasn't crowded either, so don't write this place off on account of bad weather. \n\nAt $35 a person, the Sunday brunch seems pricey, but if you have no qualms about overeating and overdrinking, you'll definitely get your money's worth.",

It's not dirty, per se.  It just doesn't look very clean.  Everything looks like its falling apart.  It probably gets its business from suburbanites like me craving what we think of as Chinese food.\n\nAll that said, the food I had was palatable.

  "text": "Pro: the food is delicious, The sauces are unique, and the sides are great. I would go out of my way to come here for the mac and cheese alone. The tenders are better than the wings! Don't ask me why maybe i'm a wing snob. There is seating upstairs so you can actually dine in and it's comfy and clean. \nCons: The staff are young so they are very un-involved in helping. Of course they are going to be friendly but it seems like unless they know you, it's not going to be an outstanding experience. Nothing specific happened to me but the person upfront seemed 'shy' until a buddy came in. The menu is online but that is the ONLY way you can order if you are in a hurry, unless you come in. There is no take out menu at the front area.  YOU CAN NOT CALL AN ORDER IN. There is no parking so it would make sense to call it in before you arrive, grab and go. But somebody messed that up for everyone. Seeing there is no parking out front, or just about anywhere up there, you kind of have to walk a few blocks. \nIt's worth it. If you can find a good space have them cook the food fresh, it's all the difference. \nBeyond that this has to be one of my favorite places to eat in University city.",

After waiting about a half an hour looking for a Starbucks sign, I see one for this location.\n\nI pulled into the lot, and it was pretty busy. I figured I could live with that, knowing that my local Starbucks moves pretty fast through the line. I was sorely mistaken. When I walked in, probably 15 people in line and virtually no one sitting down. After standing there for 10 minutes and not seeing any progress. Myself and a few others bailed. The person in front of me said they seemed more focused on serving the people in the window than people in the building.\n\nI walked over to McDonald's and got a couple of apple pies, coffee and was on my way. The people in front to me still had not been served.\n\nThis is not typical of my experience with Starbucks.  Caveat emptor!",

I order the same thing every time, salad and spaghetti/meatball combo.  It really makes my week, I kind of look forward to it.  The spring salad is fluffy and fresh with a touch of roasted red peppers for color and flavor.  The spaghetti portion is just my size and it's topped with an extra large meatball.  Now, if this isn't enough, you also get bread and oil.   This whole bundle of joy is a mere $8.  Boom!  Lunch around Vandy isn't the cheapest so this makes my wallet happy.  I do have to note though this isn't the best pasta in town, I mean it's good, but it's no Mama Mia's or Cafe Nonna, but it's perfect for what it is.  I should also note the staff, because this is a lunching place, brings your meal out in almost record time.  They have it down to a science.  (I always eat in the bar area so I don't know if this is true for the tables.)  Thanks Amerigo, see you later in the week!",

I had never tried sake before and there were a lot of other flavors in the drink so I still am not quite sure what it tastes like. To eat I ordered the yellowtail nigiri. It has to be some of the best nigiri I've had in stl. Then I got the Japanese pumpkin. The flavor of the curry was amazingly smooth with just a little bit of spicy.

It happened to rain the entire length of our trip, but it did not make the experience any less exciting. We drank, laughed, listened to music and most importantly...pedaled ourselves along the streets of Indianapolis. The looks people gave us along the way were priceless. It was as if their eyes were saying, \"Ah, I'm so jealous!\" and \"Why have I not done that before?!\" So the bike experience lasted around 2 hours, but don't worry - they are more than willing to make bar/bathroom stops along the way. For example, we stopped along Mass Ave and walked around for a bit before hopping back on the bike of wonder. \n\nAffordable? Yes, it is! With all of the seats filled, it comes out to be about $25 per person. The owners are incredibly friendly and chat along the way. You're able to have your own music selection, so you have the freedom to jam to anything from JT to the Spice Girls (just a few faves of mine.) With the HandleBar originating in Amsterdam, I'm so very thankful that it has now made its grand appearance in Indianapolis.",

He's so helpful in explaining what exactly is in your chaat, what kind of lassi is good if you've never had one before, and always tells you to try your drink/food first before paying to make sure you like it. Both times I've been here, he's also given free samples of some of the other lassi flavors that my friend ordered!\n\nI've tried the peach and coconut lassis and they were both delicious. I liked the peach more though. I've also had the bhel puri chaat, which is a great mix of flavors and textures - crunchy papri and sev, tangy chutney, sweet mango, potatoes, and other things whose names I'm not entirely sure of.\n\nI definitely recommend Mood Cafe if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal, or a refreshing lassi!",

  "text": "Las Fuentes is a festive, new Mexican restaurant located in a strip mall at the corner of MacKenzie and Heege Rd in Affton.  They serve an Americanized version of Mexican food (lots of cheese, and fried tortillas, etc).  Prices are a tad higher than your average mom and pop shop, but lower than your average corporate run Mexican restaurant.  The servers are friendly, but they seem a little understaffed for the size of the restaurant.  The menu is a little busy and not organized in a user friendly way, but there are lots of photos of the food, which helps.  You have to ask for water.  The chips are good when warm, but just okay when they cool off.  The salsa isn't spicy, but it tastes fresh and homemade.  I had the shrimp taco dinner ($12.25) and the portions were very generous.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and I left full.  This meal can easily be split.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal.  I would like to see a few menu options with fresh avocado instead of guacamole, but I'm glad they make their guacamole in house.  Overall I had a good experience and the food came out fast.  I still love authentic style the best.",

My fiance is a very healthy eater, and I am TRYING harder to be.  We do a lot of our grocery shopping here, so I'm used to the steep prices. My issue is with the people that shop here. They are RUDE. I'm not sure what it is about Whole Foods that brings out the a-hole in people, but people in this store seem to leave their manners at the door.\n\nFor one thing, everyone seems to be in a hurry. They all think whatever THEY came in to buy is more important than what YOU came in to buy.  So... there's constantly people reaching over you to get something (usually without saying \"excuse Me\"), and lots of \"near-misses\" with shopping carts.  When we are in Whole Foods, we like to read labels for ingredients and the customers here just don't allow for you to shop leisurely. No matter where you go in the store, you are made to feel like you are in someone's way.  \n\nMy rating is based solely on my experiences with the customers. Quality-wise, everyone knows Whole Foods always has fresh produce and we buy a lot of our seafood here. I also like the salad bar, selection of vitamins and herbal supplements and cosmetics.  In fact, if I could remove the customers from this store, I would probably give Whole Foods a solid 4 or 5.",

  "text": "When I was in college, Blenders in the Grass was my go-to smoothie place, so when I was recently there for a little reunion with my college bffs, I hit up this Blenders over by our hotel.  I tried an acai smoothie and ordered a shot of wheatgrass, both of which were delivered to me quickly and super fresh.  The smoothie made me feel like a million bucks, the wheat grass shot went down easy and I got a taste of nostalgia that continued through a really lovely weekend.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't get to try their acai bowls!  They have those now and they sound heavenly: Organic Sambazon Acai blended up thick with strawberries, banana, and a splash of apple juice. Topped with granola, sliced bananas and a touch of honey.  Well there's always next time!\n\nLove UCSB, Love my smoothie memories and LOVE Blenders in the Grass!\n\nYelp 100 Challenge: 63/100",

  "text": "The service here is spectacular.  After we parked along the street nearby, I went in to ask if we could sit out on the patio and although the hostess was not spotted, I saw two staffers chatting at the bar area who immediately spotted me, so I asked them about sitting on the patio.  One of them said we could and apologized about not being up front at the restaurant when I walked in, which was totally fine with us.  He was very, very nice and allowed us to pick a table outside and got us menus before our server came out, which was shortly after.  And with the great service - our server was very nice and checked in with us about getting refills, getting more beers, bringing anything else, etc...  She also was well-informed about the menu when we would ask for specifics on items.\n\nUnfortunately though, I didn't like my burger as much as I had hoped.  I ordered the Taco Truck Burger, which came with guac, sour cream and tortilla chips on a burger, so sounded amazing!  But it wasn't something I'd order again, as I thought it was very bland - even with all of the jazzed up toppings.  It didn't taste like the patty was seasoned at all nor the guac, which was odd.  The sweet potato tots though were yummy.  I do like that instead of fries you can get tots, especially sweet potato tots.  I recommend getting the sweet potato tots with the garlic aioli that the server recommended for me when I asked if she could bring me an aioli to go with.  I just wished the burger had been more to my liking.  \n\nThey have some local beers on taps, and most are from the east coast.  Patio seating was spacious, looking out to the street/Gulch area and they have heated outdoor lamps there.",

  "text": "Yesterday I headed to Curtis Hixon Park for yoga in the park by Yoga Downtown Tampa. http://www.yogadowntowntampa.com/YogaDowntownTampa/HOME.html\n\nIt was fabulous! The eastern side of the park, with the tiers, is shaded by the museum in the late afternoon/early evening, and all the tiers filled up with people ready to get their yoga on by 6 p.m. Doing yoga outside with a couple hundred people was very cool (only figuratively...despite the shade, it was hot!).\n\nThe park is a great place for yoga. It was clean and well-groomed, and has public restrooms close at hand. Having the shaded museum patio was great for my group, as a place to hang out for a while before yoga. Parking in the parking deck right next door was also very convenient.\n\nI can't wait to go back to Curtis Hixon Park for yoga again!",

They literally sell fancy feast pate here for 58 cents a can. That's unreal to me, so we stocked up on that.

  "text": "Craft fried chicken? Sounds kind of gimmicky to me... until I tried it and said to myself, \"Wow, this is good stuff!\" I tried a sampling of their three craft fried chicken offerings - white meat tenders, dark meat tenders , and wings - as well as their hand-crafted \"Red Neck Pecan Pie.\" The reason why the chicken is so good is because it's buttermilk battered with a pretzel crust. The chicken's not perfect, however. My white meat piece was a superior experience with its big slab of juicy breast meat and wonderful pretzel crust coating. My wing, on the other hand, was a little dry. The dark meat pieces were okay - one of my pieces was a little stringy - and nowhere near as good as the white meat piece. I typically enjoy dark meat over white meat for its richer flavor, but it wasn't happening here. I really like the pretzel coating. It's nice and crunchy and provides a good balance with moist chicken. The chicken is priced at $11 per pound and each little container of dipping sauce is 50 cents. The pie, which resembles a homemade Hostess cherry or apple turnover, was quite good, but priced a bit high at $4. You'll be amazed at how quickly your bill adds up. My four pieces of chicken, pie, and dipping sauce costs about $10 and some change. I would expect these kinds of prices in Center City, but not in a neighborhood full of college students. Regardless of the price, a solid three stars, four if I didn't eat the wing or dark meat.",

  "text": "I was looking for some Chinese comfort food during my recent visit to Philadelphia and Lee How Fook was a delightful find on the edge of Chinatown. I have to admit, the picture on Yelp of the dry-style chow fun (gwon-chow-gnow-haw) didn't hurt... \n\nThe restaurant has some pretty authentic selections as far as Hong Kong/Cantonese cuisine, at least I could understand most of what was being said behind the revolving door leading to the kitchen. Aside from the two of us, there was another Asian family of 3 that we were seated next to, and the rest of the parties in the restaurant were Caucasian. I would have to agree with Ramen F. and say that the ambiance is not as intimidating as a hole-in-wall place with ducks hanging in the window would be to beginners. The waiters all speak English and the menu is bilingual, all things that help to make the environment more friendly. The caveat is that they also have a \"Chinese\" menu with additional dishes that we recognized and could order from... \n\nThe half order of Peking Duck surprised me in a couple of ways. First of all, if this was really Peking Duck, then I wasn't very impressed. The Peking Duck that I'm used to has a crispy skin which is prized and is usually served with steamed buns and hoisin sauce. The duck that we had was more like ordinary roast duck, the presentation was a bit low-key. Now, it's possible that we ordered roast duck instead of Peking Duck, I'm going by the online menu to help me write this review and I don't remember if we ordered one or the other. It would behoove those who can tell the difference to ask the waiter what they are getting. In any case, the duck tasted alright as long as it was just roast duck... \n\nThe Flavored Beef Brisket Hot Pot (gnow-nom-faw-bow) was very good, everything that I was looking for as far as comfort food. The beef is of a lesser cut but is braised until the flavors of the ginger, garlic, and scallions are all melded together with the meat into a delightful stew. Eat this with a lapping bowl of steamed rice and you get a delicious beef bowl... \n\nWe needed some sort of green vegetable to balance out all of the meat so we also ordered some Sauteed Chinese Broccoli (hong-gneen-guy-lon) to go with our dishes. The broccoli stalks were crisp but not chewy, and the dark leaves had a slight mustard taste, just as they should. The oyster sauce is thick and sweet, and serves to offset the flavor of the leaves somewhat. I thought the quality was pretty fresh...\n\nI thought the prices were very reasonable... \n\nWe walked away, satisfied and food happy; glad to have found this oasis of Cantonese cuisine during our vacation...",

  "text": "Generally, I'm not a huge fan of mexican food, but Juan's Flying Burrito is pretty freaking awesome. They've got a huge menu, tons of vegetarian options, and an interesting collection of servers with an equally eclectic decor. They also have an unusually broad selection of margaritas--not as in flavored margaritas, but as in whether they're made with cointreau or triple sec, whether they've got grand mariner floating on top, and so forth. Then again, perhaps this isn't unusual; I seem to (vaguely) remember that Superior Grill has a similarly broad selection. \n\nBoth Juan's locations are equally good, as far as I'm concerned, though I end up at the Magazine Street location more often. The food is always fantastic at either place, and the portions are huge, so if you go for dinner it's likely you'll go home with tomorrow's lunch, as well. \n\nAccording to their (rather elaborate) website, there's apparently a new patio at the Magazine Street location. Good weather for it, but it sounds like the patio is largely for smokers, which is bound to ruin your meal. Unless you're a smoker, I suppose. \n\nAlways a great choice, if you've not made it to Juan's yet, definitely go check it out the next time you're craving really, REALLY awesome mexican food.",

  "text": "Cheu Noodle Bar's Black Garlic Wings are likely to have ruined many future Sunday football delivery orders for me. These things are criminally delicious. I think I could eat an infinity times infinity of them. Perfectly crispy skin, juicy dark meat in every bite, shishito peppers on the side (a personal fav), and that sweet-meets-salty mystery sauce?! With pigskin season around the corner, I'll never be able to enjoy future boring BBQ and buffalo wings quite the same.\n\nLuckily, Cheu is no one-trick winged pony. Their Charred Corn is a messy, but inspired take on elote. I was surprised to see how well truffle oil paired with corn on the cob, although those who worship everything truffle probably just scoffed at such initial skepticism. And while I was hoping for bigger chunks of crab meat, my Cold Jade Noodle entree got better with every dash of sriracha, every chopstick-clasped peanut (the real winning taste here).\n\nCheu is a small, casual space that doesn't take reservations. We only waited maybe 15 minutes for a seat at the bar, but in that time, the staff let us place drink orders (the special was $4 Foster's 24 oz. \"oil cans\") and guzzle brews on the sidewalk. They had a great beer selection otherwise (Oskar Blues Mama's Little Yella Pils, 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat, and Allagash Tripel, to name a few), but I opted for value pick this time around. I'm typically a traditionalist when it comes to noodle joints, but Cheu's creativity was just too delicious to ignore. Now give me infinity more Black Garlic Wings, please.",

I arrived and was blown away by the vibrant Ocean decor!

It's an underwater fairytale.\n\nThe wine selection is nice too. I had the Whitehaven Sauv Blanc. They also offer a Pinot Gri though the Sauv was very crisp and refreshing. There wasn't an over bearing sweetness. \n\nNow the sushi. The Nigiri is better than the rolls of you are doing the buffet. The buffet isn't super fancy, but it's fun. They offer more elegant choices aside from the saucy Americanized rolls which is the bulk of what makes the buffet. \n\nI had good service and for all you can eat sushi for 18.99 Uhhh, ya can't beat it.

  "text": "This is my favorite meal option at the Hyatt. They have really great people working- positive, friendly, efficient, and attentive. I appreciated the express lunch for $9.95- what a great deal. You can go serve yourself soup (I LOVED the tomato bisque!!!) and they have rolls and butter as well as a small salad bar and dressings that are included with the express lunch. Then you get half a sandwich and they bring that to your table. My husband and I both had the egg salad sandwich which was pretty good. A soda is also included with your meal. I think the unlimited soup and salad is worth the $9.95 on its own!\n\nI went back tonight to order a bowl of chicken noodle soup to take to eat in my room and it is a huge container of hot soup with a lot of curly noodles, big pieces of grilled chicken, green onions, carrots, celery, a few matzo balls (I think- I didn't really like them that much) and these big \"kreplach\" which are like dough balls with meat in them (I don't think it was chicken but those were tasty once I realized there was something inside) in a nice and hot broth. It was $10 for a bowl but I understand why- it's a big portion and a hearty soup- very good. I appreciated that they had me go sit in a big cushy chair in the bar/lounge area while I waited for my soup to be ready to go, and even offered me a glass of water. I wasn't given a soup spoon to go- just regular utensils with a regular size spoon but that's a small thing. It was nice that they didn't give plastic utensils but real silverware and cloth napkins. \n\nOverall, this is where I recommend at the Hyatt- relatively affordable, very good food, friendly service.",

Loved all of the browns and the atmosphere, made me feel very welcomed and comfortable.\n\nOur server was fast, friendly and helpful!  I loved loved the menu! As a person who watches carbs I really appreciated the low carb menu options.  I went with the Atkins flank steak option that came with 2 sides.  The steak was tender and cooked perfectly.  \n\nAdd the atmosphere, friendly service, great food and friends.....perfect place to grab a quick lunch!",

  "text": "After seeing a very good performance at the Rep, the D's and T's made it back to Brio for dinner with a bottle of a very good 2000 Toscano Alte d'Altesi.  It is worth noting that Brio does not charge corkage for the first bottle.  The glasses were acceptable.  Our server does need a little work on his cork removal skills.  This is not the first that we have had recently who broke the cork when the cork was in good condition.  They need to learn to be gentle with them until they start to move.\n\nMs T and Ms D had a Tomato Caprese salad that they both liked although the tomatoes were clearly showing that they were out of season and they were stingy with the balsamic.  The portion was very good and they were not stingy with the fresh mozzarella.  Mr D had the Tomato Bisque and I had the Lobster Bisque.  Both were very good.  The lobster version was well flavored and rich, with bits of lobster meat.  I felt it may have been a little over thickened with a roux or another starch, giving it a bit of a slimy texture, but it was not a serious issue.\n\nMs D ordered Veal Marsala and , Mr D had Veal Milanese.  Both were well presented and received solid reviews.  The marsala version was a classic style with mushrooms and Fettuccine Alfredo on the side. The Veal Milanese was topped with cherry tomatoes and white wine caper sauce and had roasted potatoes on the side. \n\nMs T chose the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine and I was able to snag a spool of the pasta and can say that it was very nicely sauced.  The sauce was billed as \"spicy lobster\" and it was nice to feel a little heat from what was probably cayenne.  There were flakes of crushed red chile apparent in the dish.  The pasta was properly cooked, there was plenty of seafood and the right amount of sauce.  By that I mean it was not drowned.  Half of this came home with us.\n\nI agonized over the beef, chicken and veal dishes and then veered off course and chose lasagna Bolognese.  I love lasagna and this is as good as I have had in a restaurant.  The flavors were elegant and well developed.  Everything was balanced.  In particular it was not covered with an inch of Bechamel, even better, there was none!  The texture was tender, there was plenty of very finely ground veal in the meat sauce plus sauce Alfredo and mozzarella.  I enjoyed a taste of fennel seed in the meat sauce.  The whole thing went very well with the wine.  It was a huge serving and I also brought more than half home.  \n\nI was not sure what to expect from Brio, given that it is part of a giant chain, but we had a very good experience.  Many people complain about the prices, but I did not find it to be out of line.  Four dinners with soup or salad, wine corkage, coffee and ample servings for about $32 per person is not overpriced.  Also consider that Ms T and I made four nice meals from this.  The only negative aside from the missing corkage skills, was that the place is very noisy.  So while I prefer to go to the one-off places, I could certainly see us going back based on this experience.",

It was alittle bit of a wait for a table, so we grabbed a nice glass of wine at the bar. Our bartender Bailey, was very knowledge and quick to serve us. I had the Moscato he had the Red Zinfandel, both excellent choices, because we had more than one glass each. \n\nOnce we were seated on the patio, our server Seth was quick to greet us with water and menus. The menu was not overwhelming, I had the chicken with faro, and vegetables. He had the shrimp with faro and vegetables. They looked like the same dish when they arrived, and sadly Seth was not sure what faro was. For those of you that don't know, it is similar to rice. Dinner took a little longer than we thought it should, but we did have the wine and nice conversation. \n\nNext was desert, they had 5 options to pick from. We both selected the crème brulee, it was just the perfect ending to the meal.",

On top of that I ordered broccoli Rabe. It had so little broccoli Rabe that it was not even visible. I've seen more parsley on potato salad. The french fries were cold mushy it tasted like frozen turd.\n\nIt was so bad I made the trip back and returned the entire meal. That is when the manager kicked in as well as the grill team. They accepted responsibility and made me a new sandwich.\n\nI have eaten enough meals to know when it is corporates fault and not those on the ground. The food was not fresh and the recipe is overly salty. \n\nCold fries is on the staff. They are a rare treat and should be served hot an crisp. I eat oatmeal in the morning. \n\n\nThe second sandwich was just as bad. It's the ingredients - terrible.\nThe fries were hot and crispy this time but again way to salty. \n\nNote to Tony Luke - you can add salt, you can't take it off. Also  the broccoli rabe was tasteless and mushy. You got an extra star for the staff and store manager. The food is crap.",

  "text": "Kermit's is a great addition to the neighborhood.  It could, however, certainly be greater.\n\nI've tried a few of their offerings and, so far, the only thing I'd definitely get more of is the pizza.  They have different varieties of crispy, thin-crust pizzas for your nomming pleasure available by the slice.  A greater variety is available if you order a whole pie.\n\nI've also tried their mushroom pocket, which I found too greasy.  Their coconut macaroon was pretty tasty, but seemed somehow too much.  The desserts generally look pretty good. They serve La Colombe coffee, which should be good (I haven't tried Kermit's version, so can't speak to it, but it's always great at La Colombe itself).\n\nThere is no seating inside, so if you're not taking your food to go (or getting it delivered), then you can stand around awkwardly eating your stuff.  Or step outside and take in the industrial landscape of Washington Ave. and 22nd.\n\nStaff is generally friendly.  Prices are what you'd expect to pay somewhat closer to Rittenhouse.",

I did like the thousand islands type dipping sauce it came with though. \n\nFor the main attraction, I went with a classic burger.

Sunday afternoon was hot, but started to cool down later on the evening. \n\nSERVICE (3/5) was spotty - didn't get refills on water, but I think that's 'cause there was only one waitress taking care of everyone.

I should've had a sip before leaving...it was 7am and I had an unusually early meeting, so I needed to get going (my mistake for not checking!), but once you add too much sugar, it's not redeemable!

I called a day ahead to see that the tour I wanted was available, then booked online (online reservations are discounted), then called back to confirm that my desired time was approved (you can't actually reserve a specific time online which adds a seemingly unnecessary step, but oh well).  \n\nSunday morning and a cold front whipped through NOLA overnight.  I piled on all the layers I could find in my suitcase thus earning my bf's new nickname for me: Southern Hobo.  I'd arranged for an 8:30am pick-up from my hotel and the bus arrived at 8:45.  It's about a 45 minute drive from the Quarter to the swamp just on the north end of the lake, and our bus driver chimed in with some narration here and there and otherwise let us jam out to some good tunes (U2, the Beatles, etc).  \n\nIt being an uncharacteristically cool morning there was not a lot of action on the swamp.  Captain Rob certainly kept us entertained with interesting facts and witty jokes, and he took us out much farther than usual in search of alligators and snakes.  We did see a few as the sun began to peek out from the clouds, and a couple were tempted over by marshmallows and hotdogs.  I'd hoped for more bird commentary to fill in the gaps, but the gentleman next to me and I had our own little avian nerd-out at the back of the boat.  We were on the swamp about two (freezing) hours, so water and a snack were a good idea for me.  Definitely bring water on a hot day; you'll need it!",

I'd sign that statement in my own blood. The juiciest, smokiest, most delicious pork belly is with a light amount of sauce on a little pancake. Don't you dare split this dish with more than 2 people. In fact, don't share it at all. \nThe Bacon-Wrapped Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates were also very very good. I love dates and these hit the spot. I'd honestly rave about them more, but when paired with the pork belly, it's hard to give them the credit they would get if they had to stand on their own.\nAnd finally the Seared Scallops on tabbouleh sauce, ginger-lemon raita. The best scallops I had in the city. These were $14 and I paid $31 for the same amount of scallops as an entree in another location.. so not only were they better here.. they were a dang steal.\nCocktails were great as well, but did I mention the pork belly?

This was our first time to this neighborhood and to this restaurant and we already can't wait to come back.  The area is great and there's lots of cool restaurants and shops and parking was no problem either.  It reminded us of Hoboken.  Anyway, we were greeted at the door with a smile and immediately seated.  We immediately loved the atmosphere of the place with a real old time feel coupled with western touches and a band playing upstairs.  The waiter came over and told us it was happy hour so we ordered the $5 old fashioned (awesome) and it was $1 off all drafts and there were so many great beers to choose from.  I couldn't decide on a beer so the waiter said he would be right back and he came back with a bunch of samples for me to try.  Wow!  The menu here is so great we wanted to order everything! And you can get a vegan version of almost everything on it too.  So we decided on buffalo vegan wings (there were also great sauce choices but we settled on the buffalo).  The wings were incredible!  Then we got the vegan junkyard fries which also blew us away as did the amazing vegan nachos.  My daughter ordered the vegan chicken parm over penne and this was so light and crispy with a killer spicy marinara sauce worthy of a top Italian restaurant!  My other daughter got the vegan chicken and waffles.  Everything was so good we were just speechless.  The service was the icing on the cake as our server was so personable and attentive and took our orders without writing a thing down and got everything just right.  We can't wait to come back.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful - which has not been my particular experience at the store on Tchop. I would say it rivals the customer service found at Whole Foods. \n\nThe produce section is a bit small, but does carry most of the things I want. I like that they offer herbs that are grown on the roof top of the building. The vino selection is incredible and they regularly host wine tastings. The wine connoisseurs are very approachable and have given me great suggestions on $12 table wine for dinner.\n\nThe made-to-order sandwiches are like $8, HUGE and they do not skimp on the meats and cheese. Great bang for your buck! The \"Asian soup\" is akin to pho and has been hit or miss for me personally.\n\nLastly, I love the tables littered outside on the sidewalk. With fall weather approaching, it makes for a convenient people watching spot.",

So we popped in here and took a bee line to the stairs where we were seated in front of a huge projection tv (over 80'!!!)  To start I ordered a beer and a dozen char grilled oysters (**** stars) they were delicious and had a hint of parmesan on them that made them taste SOOOO good.  For my meal I ordered the muffleatta (***1/2 stars) it was HUGE and tasty but had a little too much olive oil drenching the light and toasty bread for my taste.\n\nI gave the fries to my buddy's daughter and had a order of pepper onion rings (**** stars) light, crispy and well seasoned is all I can say about that one.   This this place is touristy. so you can expect to pay a premium on the food.  But you get large servings and will definitely leave full and with a doggie bag.",

This is one of my pet peeves about Yelp i.e. That  this is not clear in the survey questions.  But I digress....\n\nEverything from here was tasty.   The baguette is good but not as good as others available around the city.  It is pleasantly chewy but very dense.   I would rate it 4 stars.   Croissants were great and large 4.5 stars, and available in ham and cheese, chocolate, and plain.   I also sampled a variety of pastries - key lime, lemon, cheesecake square, and coconut. All strong 4s.\n\nCoffee is also available for takeout but they also had Vietnamese iced coffee ready for takeout!   Yum! 5 stars and a great surprise on a summer day.    Parking can be challenging.  Service is great.",

A giant squeeze bottle of Fancy's Hot Sauce sits by the register for you to dose your sandwich if you're one who likes it hot.

  "text": "A++++++++++++++++++++++ flavor. We ordered the Cajun Classic bucket with BOIL House flavor, extra high heat, and split it between a party of two. This particular combo could easily be demolished by one person but we didn't want to get too full before our dinner at Luvi that night, so we settled for having this as our \"appetizer.\" #WINNING\n\nI was so sad when we exhausted our supply of shrimp and crawfish. I could easily have eaten more but we had dinner plans elsewhere so I just sat there amidst a sad pile of crawfish and shrimp peels. It was SO GOOD that DH and I tried to count all of the places we've had crawfish so far: NorCal, SoCal, Vegas, Chicago, Chicagoland, Dallas, Atlanta, Middle Georgia, multiple places in Florida that I can't remember, and last, but not least, NEW ORLEANS! BOIL definitely ranks in the top three. The flavor was spicy, savory, and garlicky with a hint of smokiness. \n\nExtra high heat was not as high as I'd expected. On my personal scale, it was more of a 3.75 out of 5. Bdub's Mango Habanero inflicts way more pain than this one did but it was still a good sauce. One major disappointment was the size of the crawfish. They were SO PUNY! The shrimp were a nice size however. I would have preferred more sauce to dip all of my peeled seafood in but the pickin's were slim in that shallow platter. \n\nThis is another joint I'll definitely be revisiting on my follow-up trip!",

  "text": "My first day in New Orleans landed me in the French Quarter. I looked across the street and noticed Cajun Encounters. When I am in an unfamiliar city, I tend to take a tour.\n\nI got helpful suggestions on what tours were available. I did a city tour and a swamp tour. I did the city tour immediately. The helpful gentleman suggested that I grab a drink or snacks a few stores down. He indicated that by the time I got back, the bus would be there.\n\nSure enough, after getting an individually wrapped s'mores snack and a bottled water, the bus was here. I boarded and showed him my ticket.\n\nIt was extremely humid during my entire trip. I welcomed being in an air-conditioned bus. It was comfy and allowed me to take great photos of the city.\n\nThe tour consisted of showing more of the French Quarter. There were also stops at the St. Louis Cemetery (it's gorgeous for a cemetery) and Morning Call for some beignets. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and had a terrific sense of humour.\n\nIt was sad to see all the abandoned houses after hurricane Katrina. Folks picked up and left for good. We also saw the downtown area and the contrast in building architecture. New Orleans has recovered nicely since that hurricane hit.\n\nTwo days later, I did the swamp tour. The bus picked us in front of the Cajun Adventures store and drove us over to the swamp area to catch a boat.\n\nIt was pretty humid being on the boat. Luckily, the boat had a flat roof, which helped. I saw a lot of animals, including wild boar, raccoons, and alligators.\n\nIt was odd seeing alligators eating hot dogs and large marshmallows. I guess that they are been conditions to eat those items. I got great shots of them swimming and eating. I loved this tour!\n\nIf you buy two or more tours, you do save a bit of money. There was also a plantations tour. Perhaps I'll give that a try the next time I visit the city.\n\nI recommend going on these tours. You have plenty of fond memories visiting New Orleans.\n\n(58)",

It's the type of place you grab a bottle from your wine rack at home, jump in the car, and go enjoy an impromptu night at this Mom and Pop operation.\n\nPop is in the kitchen throwing together mass quantities of food and Mom is out among the Friday night half-filled restaurant looking like she is hating every minute being there.   Her miserable puss exudes a bad vibe throughout the restaurant.\n\nOne time I was there,  Mom was having a shouting match with one of the servers in front of the customers, to which the server exited on the spot.  It was a most uncomfortable evening.  So I waited awhile to go back.  \n\nThe Shrimp Fra Diavolo grabbed my attention and the nice spice hit the spot.  Dinner Rolls buried in garlic and oil are just leaving my taste buds 3 days later...overkill there.  The salad which was included might as well not be... iceberg lettuce and a dab of Italian dressing sitting in a tiny puddle in the middle of the salad doesn't do it for me.\n\nService is OK.  The girls are working their butts off.  I guess they don't want to face the wrath of Mom.",

It was very good; the paneer was fresh and the spices nicely balanced.  The spice level was consistent with what I would call mild-medium, meaning, there was noticeable spice, but it wasn't hot (no sweating or runny nose).  I also tried some of my friend's dish which was an eggplant selection and it was delicious!  I'll definitely order that on a future visit.  We shared some garlic naan which was fresh and flavorful.   \n\nService was great, everyone was very friendly, and clearly took pride in making high-quality food.  They didn't seem to mind that we spent kind of a long time occupying a table visiting after we were done with our meal (there was no one waiting, and still some tables open, I promise!)  \n\nI'm looking forward to my next visit!",

I was really kindof shocked to see it everywhere all the way down here in Florida.\n\nThere is a reason it is so popular. The food is AMAZING. The meats are all 100% organic and all ingredients are of the utmost in quality. And 6.25 for a burrito the size of a nerf football, the price can't be beat!\n\nThis location should be 5 stars, but gets 4 for the parking nightmare involved in trying to eat there. Whoever designed this complex should be sent to Abu Ghraib and waterboarded with hot salsa. If you try and go during the lunch rush you will experience the scenario. It can be extremely frustrating.\n\nAmazing, unique tasty food, though - which can be only said for a few chains.",

We have tried the one down south on Captive and to be honest were not too impressed but we were there late right before closing.  Although I thought the food was pretty tasty.\n\nThis once seems to not be as pricey as the other.  Could be the other's location but whatever the reason this seemed a little better with the cost.  \n\nThe venue is really nice.  The back area is like being on the beach with views of bay and pier.  The breeze kept the temp bearable and we did not seem to have an issue with mosquitos.  \n\nAlthough we had reservations the wait was still long and about 30 mins past our reservation.  Given covid restrictions we are giving a lot of slack on this.  Once we had our table out back we met our server who was very 'enthusiastic' but it was a looonnngg time between visits to our table.  Again this is a new place and covid so I really want to give them the benefit of the doubt.  \n\nI was actually very please with both the cook and flavors of the food.  We split the tuna to start.  Tuna was nice and the slaw was very tasty.  I had the skirt steak salad and the steak was cooked perfect.  Deb had the shrimp tacos.  Cooked nice with a large portion.  She didn't realise it came with the rice n beans.  Would have swapped that out.  \n\nDrinks are 'rumy' and sweet.  Decent selection of local brews and of course some good rums.  Try a flight!  \n\nOverall the food was better than expectations and the wait times I am chalking up to covid and being new.",

Nothing memorable at all.\n\nMy dad read somewhere that these beignets were a competitor of Cafe Du Monde's, so I figured we should try it. Once again, BLEH.

No bueno, especially  after the likes of Cafe Du Monde's light and fluffy goodness.\n\nService: Again, I wasn't expecting much. The guy who delivered our food did not shed one smile or word as he plopped our food down on the table.

  "text": "I have to saymy first time at bare burger was more mediocre than great.Bonus points for the owner and staff who are all very friendly , that aside there were some hits and misses with my dinner here.\n\nArrived around 5:25 to meet a friend for dinner. We sat at the \"bar\" and soon realized there is not one boozy beverage option. I'm all for organic sodas and shakes but I like the option of a beer or mixed drink with my post work meals. I stuck to water and my friend opted for the blueberry soda. I sipped it , and it was a little sweet for my liking but he seemed to enjoy it.\n\nThe menu was explained to us by who I can only assume to be a more seasoned employee but sadly he walked away and our actual server though nice seemed to be very green. \n\nOrdering was a little painful , there is only one computer to input the information into so we had to verbally tell our order which was written down and then typed into the computer after the other employee was done.\nWe shared the rings and fries , def do this option you get 4 different sauces and a decent amount of fries and around 7 onion rings.\n\nThe rings were on point a pretty solid breading to onion ratio, I appreciated the extra sauce ( buttermilk ranch ) brought out by the owner and the favorites for us both were the habanero mayo, and smoke sauce which is basically BBQ. The ginger ketchup tasted like a tikka masla sauce missing the remaining spices. The fries left a little something to be desired. The first handful were crispy and well seasoned the middle layer not so much. They were limp ( luckily my dining companion likes them limp... The fries that is) so I ate the crispies and he had the limpies . \n\nI opted for the black bean burger after getting confirmation from the kitchen that it didn't contain any tomatoes or shrooms.\nI requested two types of onions, lettuce and my pickles and jalepenos to be on the side( not a side).\nMy black bean burger was seasoned well but a little too dry. A huge jar of pickles came out on my tray ( apparently this is a the side of pickles not pickles on the side) I didn't think anything of it until the check came and I was charged 3.60 for the pickles. I questioned it with the server and based on the minimal responses it seemed he rang in my pickles incorrectly . Christian offered to pay for the pickles since he ate them ,  but I was annoyed none the less. I guess I was expecting a correction since the error wasn't mine but to not argue the point I just paid the check.\n\nI appreciate the fresh, organic ingredients and friendly service/servers but there were equal amounts awesome and meh to this meal. \n\nI can't say I'll be back soon , maybe when they can serve booze and have been open a little longer to work out the kinks.\n\nThey offer a lunch special for 12.00 m-f 11-2 and if you follow them on social media you can get a free milkshake .\n\n\n\nFor right now 2.75 stars ( I don't think 2 is warranted but 3 is me being generous )",

The host stated it could be a possible two hour wait in which we were willing to stay for. The host also stated that the bar area is first come first serve so we sat there and waited until our seats were available. 30 minutes passed and we see empty tables in which we're \"reserved\" way before us apparently so we decided to order our food while we waited. Another 30 minutes passed and the host stated there was 2-3 groups in front of us which was fine but the thing is there wasn't anyone waiting in the front; maybe they reserved online. \n\nOur food started arriving to the bar and we started to eat, at this point forget the table. The host did a really bad job at accommodating my group of 6. We all uncomfortably had to eat at the bar some of us standing up eating, etc. I just wish the host gave us updates instead of us constantly having to go to her. Now the bartender was AMAZING! He was super quick, funny and made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nThis was my first time ordering crab legs so I was super excited and wanted the full on bib and butter experience! I ordered 1lb of snow crab legs with the boil house seasoning  which is 4 seasonings in one and then you pick the \"heat\" as well; I got medium. The crab legs do not come with any sides so I ordered the bang bang shrimp for $11 which was pretty tasty and a side of Cajun French fries (SO GOOD)! \n\nOverall the food was great! So my 3 stars go to the bartender and the food!",

  "text": "Another new discovery in 2014 and a fantastic fixture in our community! Semenza's has been in business since 1980, serving up delicious pizza and wings with ice cold beverages. The current owner, Pablo or J.P. as some call him, has been working here since 1994 and bought the business in 2008! I've been living 2 miles from this place for the 5+ years, driven past it more times than I could possibly count, and yet hadn't set foot in there until last night! \n\nI came in really late (9PM) and talked with Pablo, got the story, asked how the food was, and asked about their food. At first he joked that it was all mediocre, but you could tell he was proud of it. I told him I was a wing snob, and he modestly told me they were known for them and I was sure to like them. So on his suggestion, I ordered the \"Small Special\", 1lb of wings and a small 2 topping pizza, to try this place out. \n\nSo how were the wings you ask? Fantastic! These rank in my top 3! Turns out Pablo used to work over at JOX, which serves up some of my favorites, so he knows what's up with wings. The wings were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I ordered the Nitro BBQ, aka Nitro Nutty sauce at Legends,a favorite combo of mine, and these wings were covered in it the best way possible. You could see all the chiles in the sauce, and smell the intense vinegar and chile scented steam coming off of them. These wings rock!\n\nWell what about the pizza right? It's a pizzeria after all. The best way to describe this is it combines all the characteristics of a good pie, in a way you've never had before. The crust is on the thinner side, but there's almost two layers to it. The top is chewy and doughy in all the right ways, but the bottom is cracker thin and crunchy! My pizza had jalapeno and bacon on it, and it was delicious. I've never had a crust like this though anywhere and I'll definitely be back for more. \n\nI'm so happy that I discovered Semenza's finally, met Pablo, and can proudly tell everyone about it. This is just another one of those Reno institutions that more people should visit. The food is worth the drive, and I can see it being a really fun place to crack some beers and kick it with friends.",

  "text": "Finally made a trip to The Lime after a trip to the Container Store worked up my appetite. It's your usual walk-up Mexican restaurant...burritos, tacos, salads, etc.  Things that set it apart from Moe's or Chipotle\n\n-An extensive salsa bar (10 selections including pineapple salsa)\n-Mini ice cubes (yes, I notice these things)\n-Soft corn tortillas (most places only have crispy)\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. And, for it being lunch rush, and very busy, there were still plenty of seats.  I did like how with the soft corn tortillas, they doubled them up (they have a tendency to fall apart).  Queso was really good!  Atmosphere was a little loud for my preference. \n\nI'd definitely come here again, but probably wouldn't choose it over Chipotle.",

  "text": "I'm gonna have to disagree with most people including my Yelp friends (yikes!) and say that I really didn't care for this place. I came here with my boyfriend and a couple friends for dinner one night recently, and sadly we weren't impressed. I'm a big fan of Asian noodle soups, so I was really excited to try this place, too! \n\nI got the coconut curry noodle soup which sounded promising. The curry broth flavor was initially pretty good, but it was soon overpowered by the huge glob of peanut sauce they put in the bowl. In general, I like peanut sauce but I found the flavor combo really weird, and the peanut sauce was thick and jelly-like in texture, which I found gross. I ate about half of the soup and then gave up. My boyfriend and another friend ordered the brisket soup. Neither of them liked the dish again due to the \"off\" flavor. My other friend who ordered the hand torn soup did enjoy her meal, though. \n\nOn to the drinks...I'm not a big fan of canned beer to begin with, but I figured I'd give a new one a try. They have several options, but I didn't find any standouts on the list. I  decided to go with the Brewers Art brown ale which I found to be super bitter. I wasn't excited about any of the other beer options, so I decided to stop there. One of my friends didn't like the beer she chose either.\n\nAlso, the place is quite small and only has a couple tables up front, so the four of us had to sit side by side at the bar. It was hard to have a conversation with the whole group because it was pretty loud in there. \n\nOverall, I was just disappointed because I've heard so many good things about Cheu. Given my experience, I probably won't be back. I will just have to stick to the more traditional Asian noodle soup places that I love!",

We went to Acme Oyster House the day before, and lets just say that Drago's trumps Acme's dinky little barely-recognizable shriveled oysters to the ground.  If you're ever in NOLA, you gotta try this!!!\n\nIt's not 5 stars though, only because I feel like all the butter, garlic, and parm kind of covers up the seafood taste of a fresh oyster, which I really enjoy.  The succulent texture is still there in Drago's charbroilled version, but if you think about it... you could slather butter, cheese, pepper, garlic and herbs onto a stick of cardboard and it would probably sell like hotcakes!\n\nWe had some of their regular oysters too, which were just as outstanding!!!

  "text": "The food was extremely fresh. Getting there 20 minutes after opening-time was a good idea! Well, not to say it wouldn't be fresh otherwise, but...yeah. It was our first time here. Lunch buffet, FYI.\n\nThe outside is very unassuming. The inside...beautiful lighting. Very clean. Very polite staff. \n\nMy most favorite, FAVORITE thing from Indian restaurants is lamb saag. Followed closely by saag paneer. Hey, I just freaking love saag. This place had saag, but in the form of chana saag, which I haven't had before, but thoroughly enjoyed. The cauliflower pakora was amazing. Not too fried or greasy. The chicken masala was pretty outstanding. Huge chunks of chicken in an amazing sauce. \n\nThey give you a choice of regular or garlic naan. This thrilled me. The naan took a moment to bring out because it was obviously being made fresh. It was SO good.\n\nMinus one star for beef curry. The meat was tough, the sauce was pretty flavorless as far as curry goes, and only really tasted like...meat.  And additionally...beef curry? I won't say any more.\n\nI also love tamarind chutney and this place does it right! I'm also very used to Indian places having firni as a dessert, but this one had 'fruit creme' which was pretty darn good. It was some sort of mango creme with different little chunks of fruit in it. By the time I finished my tiny bowl, it really reminded me of melted ice cream. It was good, though!\n\nIf I go to Reno again, I think I will want to come here again, but I REALLY hope they have a lamb dish next time.",

Went there after trying some samples at the Dine Tampa Bay kick-off.....and wanting to have more from their $25 three course special menu.\n\nThere were 3 options in each category, so we shared great beef satay and generous fried calamari apps, good salmon with rich salad as well as tender filet with mashed taters, followed by bourbon bread pudding and chocolate mousse that we intended to take home but somehow consumed before boxing.  The portions were perfect, so we left satisfied without stuffing.  Nice upscale touches such as a fine corn/avocado relish with the satays, great calamari toppings, and a cinnamon-shaker outline of a fork on the dessert plate. Service by Catrina  was unusually attentive and skillful as we arrived early and had nearly her entire attention.\n\nWe also checked out the regular menu that offered other items of interest, and a good beer/wine list.  Prices on some items are a bit high, but not for hotel food. And the $25 special was a real deal.  We may get back again to sample more.  This is a fine illustration of the usefulness of Dine Tampa Bay....esp. in the Summer doldrums before the Elephants arrive.\n\nSend To A Friend   Link to t",

Instead of opting to go to a sit down place we decided to drive thru Steak n Shake. It had been forever since we had been to one so looking at the menu was something we had to do. I was hoping to get a chicken melt, but I didn't see that on the menu. Instead, they had a grilled chicken sandwich and that seemed to be the only chicken sandwich I saw, so I ordered it. My husband just wanted to order a burger with fries. There was a car in front of us so we didn't think much of it. We placed our order and were told to pull around to the window to pay. The car in front of us was still waiting so that's exactly what we did too. It took about 10 minutes for the car in front of us to get their meal and then we pulled up to pay. Once we paid we waited for about 6-7 minutes before our food was ready. I guess it's a good thing they cook our food to order, but that was a long time to wait IMO.

I enjoy stopping in here especially during the drink specials.  9-11am .99c drinks and 4-6p 1/2 priced drinks (i may have the details a little switched around, but that's the just of the drinks specials) totally WIN WIN situation!",

  "text": "The food was surprisingly good for a place with such a nice view.\n\nI wanted stone crab and wanted to try a new restaurant.  I love IC Sharks, but sometimes I want more attentive service.  I also love Oystercatchers, but sometimes I don't feel like paying $70 for a single (but huge) stone crab claw.  At Rusty Pelican, my husband and I could each have half a pound of claws (which came out to 3 good sized claws) for the middle price of $48.  Not a bad deal.\n\nI also enjoyed the fried calamari and the grouper I had for my main course.\n\nDessert was utterly forgettable.  I had the apple dumpling that the server recommended.  It was a little too sweet, and the pastry was soggy.\n\nOur server was very nice and quite attentive.  The setting was definitely dated, and I commented to my husband that the Rusty Pelican is a popular wedding venue.  The view certainly is nice, so go for it if you want an outdoor ceremony.  But the indoor spaces are completely generic.",

  "text": "Okay, so I'm trying really hard to write this review in the cleanest way possible, but I really don't know where to begin.\n\nI must say, its a little shocking when you think you are getting a deep tissue massage and body scrub in a private room, then walking into a literal bathhouse, where a bunch of women (old, young, fat and thin) are in \"all their glory\".  This is not a place for the shy gal, but I decided to not make a scene and go with the flow.\n\nThe body scrub was good, but I wasn't crazy about having a half-naked lady climb all over my back for the deep tissue massage, or the countless number of women walking by and checking each other out (I guess you can't help but look at one another).  I can't say anything else without being inappropriate, but they do have private rooms for a dry massage, but not for the body scrub/deep tissue massage package.  \n\nI will come here again, but will not be entering the shower room/hot tub room/body scrub room (its all one big area). Next time, I will opt for a Swedish massage in a private room. The place is clean, their prices are good, and the people who work there are very nice.",

High quality ingredients and friendly staff complete the picture. \n\nI'm told that Ted's has lines even in the dead of winter & I can see why.

Hilltop's grill was closed, so we called Black Thorn since it was nearby and ordered a pepperoni pizza to go.  \n\nOnce at Hilltop, we opened it up and immediately made a bunch of friends.

  "text": "Went to this Brio for the first time last summer for the Yelp garden party. Didn't really get to try much more than a couple of flatbreads so I didn't have a good picture of what the place was like. I just know that they're owned by the same company that owns Bravo Cucina Italiana...so I expected good things from them. I am confused by the names...Bravo...Brio....the menus seem to vary slightly as do the prices. I've been to Bravo in Pittsburgh and Brio in Florida. So I wonder if the names just vary by region?  Anyway!\n\nSean and I decided to check it out last night after going to see a movie at Frontenac. When we got inside, there was a crowd of servers and hostesses all just mingling near the front podium thing. We were ignored for a few minutes while they casually chatted. Not really a great first impression. But I was hungry and didn't care. We were seated a little after that and we were handed menus.\n\nWow. Chicken milanese costs $19.95? Wtf. I thought it was more around $15 or so, at least from when I last ate at Bravo. But I am not entirely sure what the deal is with the different places so maybe Brio is more costly or maybe it's because it's at Frontenac. I dunno. I opted for the lobster and shrimp ravioli. It has some kind of crab thing on top with limoncello sauce. Never had that at Bravo so decided to try it. After all, for about the same price ($20.99) I might as well get something with more expensive ingredients, right? It was VERY VERY good....if a little rich. I ended up with severe heartburn later on but it was so worth it. The salad had crabmeat and a little tangy lemon flavor to it. Mmm. \n\nSean opted for the last item on the flatbread menu...some type of sausage and pepperoni thing with ricotta on top. Needless to say he ordered it w/o sausage and scraped the ricotta off, but he seemed to enjoy it otherwise. Oh, and I had a glass of wine. They were sold out of the kind I wanted but I was able to get a recommendation from our server and he let me try a sample before getting a whole glass.  Food came out LIGHTNING FAST. Was really surprised! Pleasantly surprised, that is. ;)\n\nI think I'd come back here but it's kind of spendy. Maybe to get the chicken milanese because I know it will be good, just not sure how ready I am to drop 20 clams on a chicken dish.",

  "text": "Beer sampler was alright, there were only four spots available on the paddle.  It would have been nice to try six since they were only about 2 ounce glasses.  While they didn't have too many beers on tap to choose from, a lot of them were IPA's and a couple of them were local crafts - my favorite of the four was a well known Marlette Red from Virginia City, it' somewhat standard around town.  The two guys behind the bar were very friendly and eager to answer any questions I had about the beers.\n\nSince it was happy hour we ordered the cherry chipotle wings and the sweet potato tots.  When the wings came out I was terribly disappointed because they were shriveled to the bone and loaded with sauce to hide the fact that there was absolutely no meat on them.  I'm not ashamed to return something when it's inedible, so I kindly told the guy my issue with them and he gladly took them back.  However, the sweet potato tots were FANTASTIC!  I enjoyed every last one, slightly greasy, but fried to perfection.  And for only $3 you can't go wrong!\n\nI'm glad I had the chance to check another happy hour spot off my list.

  "text": "Went here last night to try out the food and I have to say, fellow Yelpers, that I was slightly disappointed. \n\nGot the feta fries ($7), small bruschetta ($8), small butternut squash ravioli ($8), and fish tacos ($9). I knew what I was getting into with the feta fries, but why not just melt the damn cheese so I don't have to pick it up with my fingers and PLACE it on the fries? The fish tacos were alright, but I expected the fish to be breaded. Sadly, it was not and the fish was a little too fishy for me (yes, I realize that sounds silly). The redeemers were excellent; the bruschetta and the ravioli. I have no idea what they put in that ravioli: cinnamon? butter extract? crack? but it was effing heaven. It's the butteriest butter flavor you can have AND the ravioli is surprisingly sweet. It would be a slam dunk for me, but the $8 is just sooooooo small. I knew going in that portions would be small but they're really teeny tiny. \n\nWe also had the orange blossom sazerac ($9) which my boyfriend loved and the Lavender Lace ($7), a champagne and lavender bitter drink which I thought would be more lavendery. I probably won't come back but I'm glad I tried it. \n\nAlso, as a side note, this is one of the more low-key places on Frenchmen and it you sit in the back you won't have to yell to talk.",

However, you have to be able to read Chinese and order from their \"secret\" menu.  Are they assholes for not translate the menu and keep their delicious authentic goods from the general population?  Not really.  I think \"lost in translation\" is the reason why a restaurant like Wok on the Wild Side has so many negative reviews and why many restaurant don't even bother with translation.   \n\nI have never seen a restaurant generated so many opposite opinions.  I was intrigued by my fellow reviewers and I had to see it for myself.  Is this place really bad or simply misunderstood.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean and simply decorated.  The owner was from Dong Bei (North East China) and a first time restauranteur.  It seems like the combos were not well priced compare to the entrees and personally I would not recommend stir fry dishes that had being sitting out for more than 15 minutes.  I got the entree size xiang la pai gu and it came with a bowl of steamed rice.  I counted 11 meaty ribs pieces  with jalapeno, onions, and dry red chilies.  The sauce was very spicy and flavorful, but I agree with others that it was salty even considering that Sichuan cuisine tends to be heavily seasoned.  Most restaurants use cheaper long grain rice, but here they used starchier short grain rice that Chinese, Korean, and Japanese prefer because sticky short grain rice pick up sauce better than hard fluffy long grain rice.   \n\nI spotted a pan of kou shui ji next to a line of ubiquitous looking stir fries.  I can't help it but get a small box to go.  Kou shui ji literally translates to salivating chicken, so good, you'll salivate thinking about it.  Its boiled whole chicken cut into more manageable chunks, with bones and skins, soaked in a sauce made of spices and red chili oil.  This was not on the menu and it was very good and authentic.  Now, I am definitely intrigued and already planing a future visit.  If they can tone down the sodium by a notch this place would be 4 stars.",

  "text": "Had a hankering for really good seafood, and not fried, simply boiled bucket seafood like in Mass, Cape Cod etc.  Sadly I can't find anything remotely like The Boiling House near home (Yardley PA).  I remember my days living in Hoboken NJ and going to Just BeCaws in Jersey City.  Well, we found a suitable comparison to Just BeClaws and within only 40 minutes south in Cherry Hill NJ.\n\nLook for the red fishing boat along Marlton Pike about, just 30 yards north of the Jaguar/Land Rover dealership on Marlton Pike in Cherry Hill.\n\nThey are located deep down the center of the shopping center stores back on the right down the steps.\n\nWith the pandemic, we called to check on inside seating and their protocols which met with our approval these days. Everyone is masked, many servers with gloves and cleaning between patrons.  Tables were spotless and readied with napkins, plates lobster bid and plastic disposable gloves.  No menus, QR code scan in a placard or you can use the Yelp menu.\n\nLet me start by saying Dave, our server, was fantastic.  Handled all our questions, was courteous friendly and definitely attentive. \n\nUpon figuring out the menu and our interests we opt to pick our own dishes vs the larger multi-option dishes for the table.  I built my own seafood pot with Dungeness Crab Cluster, two large clusters weighing in at 1.25lbs of fabulous, succulent, perfectly cooked meat that was boiled with old bay and some garlic butter.  Was meal that will be remembered.  \n\nMy spouse had the seafood fried rice -- lobster, shrimp, king carb, Dungeness, snow carb meat, mussels and egg and mixed veggies.  She loved it.  As an add on, we ordered one Andouille sausage, it had kick, was a perfect complement to both our meals.\n\nBYOB, parking lot, credit cards, attentive staff, great food.\nCan't wait for the hankering to show up again soon.\n\nSee our pics.",

  "text": "The small shop in south east Philly sells Ecuadorian and El Salvadorian food.  They also do delivery within a 10 mile radius!\n \nHere, the pork pupusas were pupusa-ey-: meaning always satisfying- the combo of grease, masa, and some salty filling, but not the best around town. If we are playing favorites, Tamalex and Cafe Canela are my baes because of that thorough greasiness.\n  \nI was more impressed by the empandas. I tried the crab and the beef. Crab filling was good and also not one you see regularly, but the beef were maybe some of my favorites around town. The stuffing is a stewy mixture of beef and potato.  Now that I know, I think there is a fair chance I will drunkenly order about a dozen of these for delivery in the near future. It wouldn't be my worst idea.",

The table must have had 9 dishes total.  We had:\n\n- Sweet and sour pork with tripe and some other asian meats\n- Mayo shrimp with peaches\n- Seafood soup (not sure what it's actually called but it's delicious)\n- Fried fish with spices and red/green peppers\n- Soy sauce chicken\n- Bird's nest with chicken and vegetables (peas, carrots, celery)\n- Lobster with chow mein noodles\n- Chinese mushrooms with bok choy\n- Seafood fried rice\n\nService was typical of Chinese restaurants (minus points for seeing the waiter go into the washroom and not wash his hands properly - nasty).  Food is average. Prices are cheap. Wouldn't be my top pick for chinese food in Edmonton but it's decent.",

Across from Curtis Hixon Park is the beautiful University of Tampa.  It is an amazing view. \n\nCurtis Hixon Park is a focal point for many to see because of the many different views of the city of Tampa. You will also see that the Glazer Children's Museum is in walking distance as well as the Tampa Museum of Art. \n\nIf you are looking for a place to eat, check on the Sono Café at the Tampa Museum of Art, or walk across the street, and you will find one of my favorite places Anise Global Gastrobar.\n\nOften times, there are many festivals going on at Curtis Hixon Park. Some are pretty darn spectacular, and some are just okay. Two of the most favorite events I have been to at Curtis Hixon Park was the Burger Showdown, and the Bollywood Red Carpet Pre party for the Indian Oscar Awards. Burger Showdown was just a big huge party with tons of vendors with the best burgers in Tampa.  Picture this for the Bollywood Red Carpet Pre-Party - Imagine a Wednesday or a Thursday night with the best loudest, fun, dance music playing. It was a blast.\n\nI also love Curtis Hixon Park because it is super pet friendly and family friendly. There is a really nice little water area for the kids to play. There is also a playground for the kids, and a dog park for your dog. \n\nEvery time I go here, I love it more and more. It is a little bit smaller than many city parks, but just the surroundings make it great.\n\nI can't forget, Sundays they have farmers markets here in the morning, and in the evening on Sundays, they also have Yoga. \n\nThis is a perfect location to enjoy beautiful downtown Tampa.",

YES, I bought the local artisanal coffee beans that I freshly ground into a paper bag even though I already HAVE gifted coffee beans at home, still waiting their turn. YES, I justified roast beef at $12 a pound and Amoroso rolls at double the price ShopRite sells them for. With that said, this place has rescued me during those bleary-eyed morning commutes to work when I forgot to pack my breakfast and coffee creamer. I also discovered a new flavor of coffee creamer they sell here, so there's that. Only self-checkout options is wonderful. The layout is WEIRD though (you enter on the left even though everyone knows you go RIGHT into grocery stores, and I still forget which is the proper way to walk to check out.) Regardless, I'll be back here probably weekly, tail between legs.",

I have to agree with Steven B's review where he says the custard here is rich and creamy. You can throw anything in there and it's going to make your head spin it's that good. I usually go the cookie dough or Oreo route, but most recently I splurged with a friend on the strawberry shortcake and banana split. If you haven't tried those yet, definitely make that a priority. I've also seen people walk away with ice cream cones that HAVE to be 6-7 inches tall!\n\nIt's fun to sit outside at the picnic tables on a balmy St. Louis summer evening.

My hubby loves this places so every now and then I'll go. There's hotdogs and veggie sandwiches. So first I tried the hotdog. Eh...it's a hotdog. Certainly not worth the money the charge for it. Also, the wrap it in foil which made the bun soggy from the steam from the hot meat. Then I tried the veggie sandwich. It was a ton canned mushrooms, a couple slices of tomatoes, lettuce, onions and bell pepper. The bun was nothing but mush so I really needed a fork to eat the veggies. The veggies were extremely bland. A nice veggie burger not lose veggie sandwich would go a long way here.\n\nThe fries are okay. I would prefer a crispier french fry myself. They offer regular or seasoned. We ask for light season, if not they put so much it burns your mouth and doesn't even taste that great. \n\nThe atmosphere is great. The staff are always friendly. Service is quick. You get free peanuts in the shell. Also, it makes my hubby happy to eat here which makes me like it a little more.",

You'll also find the Philadelphia Pretzel Factory right across the food court. The Tony Luke's here isn't cheap by any stretch but you'll pay the premium when in need of a Philly fix.\n\nI loved going to the original Tony Luke's before they started popping up everywhere. They made a decent cheesesteak but you could get that in a lot of places in Philly. This place probably does a better job than most with their pork sandwiches.\n\nLooking for that familiar flavor, I ordered the roast pork with broccoli rabe. There wasn't anything really on the lighter end but I did find and order the cooked spinach side dish. The sandwich was exactly what I expected and I enjoyed every bite. The spinach side was tiny and a bit salty but otherwise good.\n\nEven though this terminal is at the far end, there's a shuttle that brings you right here from one of the more central locations. If you have the time and crave some more authentic local cuisine, this place might be worth the trip.",

The entire experience transported me into another world. Unfortunately, the food brought me back to reality.\n\nMy recommendation is that you eat somewhere else. Just come here for some dessert, coffee, or a beer. \n\nIn the end, Cafe Beignet truly is like the hot with no substance. That makes it mistress material.",

She was nice enough but seemed like she didn't want to be there, & she wasn't around much. I ordered one of the brunch cocktails ($7). It was loaded with lemon seeds.

I ordered the 96 burger, which is bleu cheese topped with honey-balsamic glazed mushrooms, onions and bacon, finished with crispy shoestring fries & garlic-horseradish aioli ($11.50). I ordered it with fries. If you order sweet potato tots it's two bucks more. \n\nI ordered it medium rare, more medium came out but at least it wasn't well done. The burger had a good flavor, the aioli wasn't too overpowering. It wasn't my favorite burger though. The fries were just okay. Everything just seemed okay.

There's not much that I can say beyond the fact that this is, like all others are, a standard Chipotle.\n\nOr maybe it's not -- this restaurant shares a historic building with a Starbucks. It used to be a Del Taco, but you can't tell that anymore. The parking situation here is a bit hairy. You'll have to make an awkward turn from Grand to get in here, and dodge Starbucks drive-thru customers. A yummy burrito, though, is worth life's minor inconveniences. (Another inconvenience: It's very noisy here. Expect to yell and be yelled at until they figure the acoustic situation out.)\n\nThat's about it. Glad to know Chipotle's in the neighborhood now.",

  "text": "A real treat for seafood lovers. This low key, hidden from the main road joint was one of the best discoveries I've found recently. My birthday coincided with father's day so I didn't want to deal with the hassle of going out on fathers's day weekend and decided to celebrate my birthday a week early here.\n\nThe dining room area was beautiful and modern. While most seafood boil places are set up like a bar, at Boiling House, you feel like you're in a fancy modern restaurant. The service was also amazing. You can choose from the menu or make your own seafood boil. First, you pick your seafood then pick the sauce that you want and finally, the spice level.\n\nI opted for their Sea Festival, which came with king crab, snow crab, Dungeness crabs, lobsters, potatoes and corns, sausages, two pounds of live crawfish, 2 fresh lemonade and garlic noodles. This order was about $150 and fed 4 people. I highly recommend the Boiling House sauce and spicy. The seafood was just amazing, everything tasted fresh and they had some huge crawfish. The sauce was very buttery and flavorful. The main surprise hit was actually the garlic noodles. Their noodles had a chewy textures that held against their super flavorful sauce.\n\nOverall, this place was solid. Although on the higher price of things, you cannot really complaint because of their location. I will be back here many times and bring lots of friends! I wonder why the place haven't had a higher ratings. Although it may not be Louisiana or Texas, Boiling House is representing the East Coast pretty well. Four for the food and one extra star for awesome service.",

  "text": "I think The Prime Rib is one of the best classic Philly steak houses.  Located on the ground floor of the Warwick Hotel near Rittenhouse Square, The Prime Rib has a rich clubby look that hits you as soon as you walk in.  It is very attractive and we were also warmly greeted by the hostess.  We were taken to a great table near to the piano player - who let me state here was 'awesome'.  He performed long sets and played everything from Piaf to Chopin with a little Brahms and Broadway show tunes thrown in. The meal we ordered from the wonderful prix fixe menu was superb.  A seeded bread roll began the feast followed by a green salad topped by their well-known house dressing - think creamy parmesan.  The juicy prime rib was done exactly as requested and we enjoyed the delicious sides of creamy spinach and steak fries.  I loved the horseradish dressing which probably was intended for the roast beef but I used it as a tasty dipping sauce for my fries.  An excellent Château du Pin Bordeaux wine accompanied the meal. Dessert was a piece of moist chocolate cake and a well-executed crème brûlée. Service was excellent by both the waitress and the attentive busboy. I had not one complaint and a happy & full stomach when I left The Prime Rib!",

  "text": "For a typical Chinese buffet (but with a Japanese name?), it has a slightly more impressive selection with the same, average buffet quality - they have oysters on the half shell, crawfish, lots of crabs, a hibachi grill, a pretty solid sushi selection, and a chocolate fountain. Obviously quality is sacrificed at a buffet, but this place is so cheap, who's complaining, right? I was stuffed here with pretty good tasting food. \n\nLowlights - fat free ice cream was terrible and obviously filled with artificial sweeteners (my siblings got the fat free while I opted for the regular fatty ice cream, which was extremely creamy), and the service. Service was terrible - we had to wait quite a while for our used/dirty plates to be cleared so our table was constantly cluttered with dirty plates as we progressed throughout our meal.\n\nIt's a standard buffet, what more do you want for $12.95?",

  "text": "Very mixed feelings...I think it's 3.5 stars, and I would like it to go up because it's exactly what Fairview Heights needs. \n\nIf this is the only sentence you read: Try the juice bar orange juice. Holy crap. That stuff is amazing and makes you think, WTH have I been drinking for years?\n\nWhat I really like:\n*Wednesdays=Double Days where the ad that is currently ending and the ad that is coming up are both valid. You don't have to come back weekly. \n*The theme of the store. It's cheaper than Whole Foods, and it has more variety than Trader Joe's. I like that it does try to source locally and has a very impressive organic and gluten-free selection, along with an encompassing homeopathic section. \n*The small grocery carts, which are a lot easier to maneuver.\n*The produce: Lots of turnover and really good prices. Separated by nonorganic and organic. And the employees will offer you a sample if you ask them about it.\n*The juice bar. I thought this was really stupid at first because it's in the back, and it's not made to order. The girl makes a bunch, bottles them, and puts them out. There's carrot, a green one, berry, and the oh-so-amazing OJ. It blows any other orange juice out of the water. Makes me want to go out, buy a $300 juicer and see if I can re-create it. It's like that ginger ale ad...only in oranges. The only sad part about it is that the prices are pretty um...high. $6.99 for 64 oz of OJ. $3 for a little bottle of green fluids. \n*The beer and wine department: The guy who works the aisles knows his stuff. Hit him up for recommendations and he will happily give them to you. If they would have wine/beer tastings once in awhile, that would be the cherry on top.  \n*The homeopathic aisles. I don't know how good they are, but there are remedies for every ailment. Some have guides, but most do not. A info kiosk would be great.\n*The spices. This is self serve and it's pretty much hidden. Works like the bulk center. You can buy how much you need at a time, and the prices are fairly reasonable too. I did notice that someone left red pepper flakes uncapped last time I was there; that's so...considerate.\n\nThe Undecided:\n*The convenience: I like that they have quick meal options. They have a salad and antipasto bar, self-serve, reasonably priced. They have cooler cases with quick meal and salad options; also reasonably priced. They have a pizza bar, which looks to be reasonable. They also have a sandwich bar, $4.99, which is okay. It honestly was like a half sandwich to me, and while it was good (not amazing), I was still hungry afterwards. Small coffee counter.\n*The bakery: Really nice selection, but do you really have to display your breads out in the open like that? All I can think about is people sneezing and coughing over them and touching them. Because you know that's happening...because it's happening everywhere else in the store. Plexiglass can be shiny too, you know.\n*The meat and seafood counter: I really like their options. They have some stuff already marinated and/or stuffed and all you have to do is cook it. There's a really thoughtful curation of sausages too; not particularly unique, but it hits all the highlights. Really good variety of seafood too. But the shrimp on special looked grossly frozen and dried out behind the counter, much to my surprise. \n*Prices: Like anywhere else, you're going to have to do your homework. It's not exactly the cheapest prices around, but it's not the most expensive. For example, they were promoting their salmon for $5.99, but Schnucks had the same for $4.99 the same week. Coconut milk is like $2 a can, which costs more than Global or on Olive, but where else are you going to get coconut milk on the East side? Also see above for the OJ price. Does it sh!t gold? Apparently so!\n*The bulk aisles with granola, oats, grains, make your own peanut butter, and dispense your own oils and vinegars: This is comprehensive. It's awesome. But I think it would be a lot more hygienic if it was behind the counter and they had associates dispensing the stuff...you just ask for how much you need and they measure it out for you. \n\nNo thanks:\n*The people who come here. I can't figure the best time to come yet. It's been packed whenever I come, although during the weekday seems to be better than at night and the weekends. People chat in the middle of the aisles without any clue that there are people behind them wanting to go through. Or the woman who parked herself  and her big cart in front of the 3 foot long beef section to peruse her ad while other people were trying to get some beef. Or the mom who let her kid slam into carts with his little shopping cart while doing nothing about it. Or the other mom who used her hands to get peanut butter samples for her kids, sucked her fingers, and then WIPED HER FINGERS on the bulk barrel top behind her. YEAH, I WAS THE ONE GIVING YOU THE DIRTY LOOK.\n\nIt's a new kind of grocery store in the Metro East; one that definitely deserves to succeed.",

Or at least that is what happened to us when we stopped in the other day.\n\nOtherwise, this is definitely the freshest most imaginative sushi I've had so far in Tampa Bay. This is the kind of sushi place you'd find in Chicago or Miami or Philly. Awesome variety of rolls, wonderful ambiance/decor, excellent service. I expect this place to get very popular very fast. \n\nNOTE: THIS PLACE SEEEMS TO FOCUS MORE ON COOKED ROLLS.\n\nThe only negatives I see that could affect its success is the location, which you can't really see unless you look very hard. It's not right on Bay to Bay, it's deep in the crevices of a little strip mall on Bay to Bay. Also, the place is very small and has only 4 or 5 tables inside. Lots of outdoor seating, if you are into that. Me, I prefer A/C and no bugs. That could present a challenge as I can easily imagine that once this place gets more popular, inside tables will be scarce. They should have made the kitchen smaller and the dining space larger.\n\nYummy rolls you will be craving all the time.",

I tried the shrimp tempura (pretty good), lobster egg rolls (o.k. - tasted mostly like cabbage, the lobster wasn't noticeable) and lamb sliders (pretty good). In general, the food was o.k. but not necessarily memorable, however, the goat cheese cheesecake was very good - not to sweet and just the right serving size.  I think that I would go back for the cheesecake.\n\nWe were told that the restaurant doesn't really do table service, so when the staff isn't nearby, you just pop over to the bar and place your order.

  "text": "Have tried both takeout and sit in meals here.  \n\nI've tried two types of Biryani here, both the Chicken and the Lamb Biryani.  I preferred neither and do not recommend ordering Biryani here.  The grain of basmati rice that is used in the Biryani here is a unique grain/type.  If I can describe it, the rice itself looks like it has absorbed too much water/broth during the cooking process.  Specifically each grain here has a certain plump-ness that is very unusual.  My fellow dinner companion one evening, who is more knowledgeable in regards to Indian food, felt the same way and we asked if the grain that was used was indeed basmati, to which we were told it was a variety of basmati.  Perhaps it is, but given my thoughts that maybe it has absorbed too much water, it is not spiced enough.  Given the thoughts of the chef in that, his dishes are not exactly authentic recreations but reinterpretations of Indian cuisine and \"fusions of classics\" this is most likely by design.  Either way after three tries, I'll skip this dish here from now on.\n\nI've also tried the Lasooni Gobi and Chicken 65 and can offer up a review that these appetizers are good.  These versions are similar to that of original with slight variations in spices.  Finally the Garlic Naan is good.\n\nI can return in the future but I'll definitely skip the Biryani.",

And not gonna lie, all the youtube videos of people eating seafood has made me want to try this place even more. \n\nHubs and I came here on a date night and it was a nice shake up to our normal dinner night out. DO NOT wear anything cute- you will get messy. \nAt least I was a hot mess.... anyway, the seafood here is super fresh. \nWe got two different pots with their famous sauce. I would get the crab legs, and shrimp again but I would actually try a different sauce. There was nothing special about their special sauce. We also got their garlic noodles- if you come here for only the garlic noodles, I would not judge you... they are that good. \n\nThis spot is also a BYO which is a big plus! \nI'd recommend this place if you are a big seafood fan or want to try something new. Personally I cant see myself being here too often unless its for the noodles.",

  "text": "Review for baked goods only (no pizza)\n\nKermit, I so wanted to like you. Your cute name, your plethora of clever baked goods, your pizza slice bike racks, your friendly staff. \n\nPizza and baked goods, why aren't more people doing this? I'll tell you why. When we were there, they were making something with onions and the whole place smelled like your mom's house when she's making stuffing. Nice right? Except both the delicate almond croissants and the box they came in had adsorbed the odor as well. Swell, just the flavor combo I was looking for! The sticky bun and the salted caramel brownie did not absorb the odor. The sticky bun was kind of a misnomer. More like a honey bun, lacking in cinnamon and raisins. The salted caramel brownie won rave reviews from others but for me, the chocolate was overpowered by the \"caramel\" which for the life of me tasted like eating a stick of butter. \n\nIt should be noted that there's no place to sit and eat your goodies.\n\nSpringfield Beverage will be opening next door.",

  "text": "I'm not the biggest expert on Indian food as I've only had it a handful of times, but most of the food I ordered from here was pretty good. I ordered one of the lunch specials - Tandoori grilled Paneer (cheese) simmered in a creamy tomato sauce/homestyle lentils flavored with tomatoes, cumin and garlic/diced winter squash stir-fried in a tomato onion sauce - and was pretty satisfied with it, although the red sauce on the Paneer was so RED that it was a little off-putting. Interesting way to serve cheese, to say the least, but the lentils were by far my favorite thing on the plate - very good. I also tried the Onion Bhaji which was really good, the red onion naan bread which wasn't bad, and the spicy mixed pickles - pickle lover that I am I had to try them, but I couldn't tolerate the taste of them at all and they ended up in the trash. Some sort of flavor in there just didn't work for me.\n\nWe had some issues ordering online - I don't know if our computer system was just slow or what, but we had a heck of time getting our orders in before 10 a.m. (which is apparently what you have to do if you order a lunch special to be picked up). It took us a while to connect so that we could pay for it via PayPal (which we didn't even want to do but it seemed like we HAD to). I had decided to order some extra stuff to bring home to the fam, so I had no problem bringing my total over the $20 minimum. Three coworkers decided to put their orders on one bill, but had trouble ordering online, so I went ahead and put their order through on my account (since I had finally figured it all out).  Anyway, lo and behold, suddenly there was a pay cash when you get there option so I guess I went through all that PayPal nonsense for nothing. Needless to say, I don't think I've ever been so frustrated ordering anything online in my life.\n\nIt also seemed to take forever to get our food which we had ordered to be picked up between 12:00-12:15 p.m. Well, we didn't get out of there until 12:45 p.m. so that was a lot of waiting, especially since we had ordered well ahead of time. The guy at the counter was helpful and friendly though, so that helped.  \n\nAll in all, it was just an okay visit. Like I said, I don't go for Indian very often so I don't know if I'll wind up here again or not.",

Everyone in our large party enjoyed ourselves for the most part. Our poor server (Amanda I think) killed the mood a bit with her artificially high \"friendly waitress voice\" that had the table cringing all night.  \n\nWe made reservations for 11 and were squeezed into a circular booth that was two sizes too small for us.  I'm not sure if that was the biggest table they had or if other larger parties made reservations first but it was a tight squeeze!  We enjoyed the guacamole, queso (made with gouda, yes please!) and salsa trio with chips.  The chips were perfection.  Light and airy, just perfect.  All were enjoyed.\n\nTheir tacos take center stage.  An order comes with 3 tacos, and I wish that you could mix and match like so many other places in town.  I enjoyed the bbq pastor tacos with a generous squeeze of lime.  I would have preferred these without the bbq, but they still were some pretty killer tacos.  It seemed everyone around the table was equally pleased with their meals, especially those that got the Nada fries.",

There is always plenty of room in this city for a fantastic Asian Fusion restaurant, and Cheu just didn't get it up for me.\n\nSmall plates were neither special or memorable -  For example, wings though perfectly crunchy, lacked the zing or enough black garlic sauce to differentiate them against any other wings in the city (perhaps except for the crunch factor); the sweet potato rangoon, was just that, and the brown butter and goat cheese somehow got lost on me.  \n\nTheir noodle dishes left me wanting so much more, as I have had far superior noodle/ramen dishes both in fusion-esque Chinatown locales (duh) and specifically Nom Nom Ramen (whose broth, flavor profile and ingredients trump Cheu's noodle dish by far)  The broths across most of the noodle dishes lacked the depth of developed flavor, and the ingredients just seemed rather ho-hum (the greens for example, seemed to be both under-cooked and over-cooked, over steamed; the pork shoulder lacked spice, was overdone)\n\nThe service is great, and the space is tiny but intimate.  Food just did not live to my expectations - as the flavors did not impress or stand apart from any similar offerings in the city.",

I got a chance to unintentionally interact with the owner and he was super nice and went out of his way and that says a lot about the business and the people that run it. I came in one afternoon and was able to be seated right away. As soon as I sat down, the table was noted to be wobbling. I didn't even notice and apparently the owner that was sitting with his family quickly sprang into action to fix it. I personally thought that was amazing! The waitress explained the menu pretty well due to me being a first time customer. I got the House Special which was the best option for the variety of food that I wanted. I kid you not guys, my food came out in less than 15 mins!!!! The crawfish was cooked perfect and they were HUGE! The crabs were perfect & the shrimp were huge as well. The sides were cooked to perfection and perfectly surrounded in Cajun sauce. I got the Cajun seasoning and medium which ended up being hotter than expected but I don't mind the extra heat-so just be aware. Overall the service was pretty awesome-of course it got pretty busy after I sat down but everyone else seemed pretty happy with the quality of food.",

But they get the job done and taste good enough for $7 (large size). In fact I was pretty trashed off just one. So be careful on the drive home. \n\nBeef Fajita's are tender and make for a good meal.

And I'm so glad I didn't. I'm in and out of the Peppermill property all the time but never seem to hit Oceano. That will have to change.  \n\nLocated in the north front end of the property, this restaurant has been updated with a bright open atmosphere. The sushi bar is in the back and very large.  Whenever possible I always sit at the bar, I love watching the chefs work and can ask questions about their recommendations and where their fish comes from.  That day I had Resty as my chef, as well as 5 others at my end of the bar. Service was spot on. And he still had time to answer all our questions about the fishes and preparations. \n\nWow, the mussels are probably the plumpest ones I've see in town with great flavor and tender.  The menu had some of the usuals from around town, but new and very different creations.  I tried the Baked Alaska and Salmon BTLA rolls. Loved the Alaska, the BLTA was interesting, I did dislike it but would have like more crispy salmon skin in it than bacon.  The nigiri I tried was fresh and on small thumbs of rice. Even the rice had a nice flavor to it.  \n\nIf you haven't already, add Oceano to your Reno AYCE sushi list.  Lunch $21 and $30.",

My husband and I tend to get the concretes, not the sundaes, because we like have everything pre-mixed. They have tons of great mix-ins!! My husbands favorite is mint, brownie, cookie dough and hot fudge. I'm usually not a fan of mint when it comes to ice cream, but theirs in light and sweet and is one of my favorites! I try something different just about every time, but just about anything with the butterscotch is delicious! One I haven't tried is raspberry...I'm thinking I need to get that soon. Also, if you get more than a few mix-ins, they usually have to put it in a bigger cup, which is awesome because you feel like you're getting more than you paid for. On the other hand, I don't think I can get a medium/large any more - it's super filling!\n\nThis place can get pretty darn crowded. Parking can sometimes be a challenge, but the line always moves fast!\n\nThe only down side for me is the fact that they don't offer peanut butter as a mix-in!!!

Let me tell you, they did not disappoint. Matter of fact, they beat Cafe de Monde hands down! The beignets were nice and fluffy with just enough powder sugar that it didn't ruin it.

It's not worth the $25 entry fee. My cousin and I went at 8 o'clock and had a scrub and massage scheduled. Upon arriving, we were two out of four women in the placeThe scrubs went well but the massage was lackluster. They used the lightest pressure on me! Once both services were finished, we decided to shower and enjoy the rest of our time enjoying the \n salt rooms. For those of you unfamiliar with Korean spa rooms, they are supposed to be heated. However, both rooms to the crystal salt rooms were wide open..\nWe ventured inside to a cold and dark room. Not how it's supposed to be! Apparently, they were getting ready to close (early) and had turned everything off! Unacceptable. With 45 minutes before their scheduled closing time, this was a bit surprising, not to mention disappointing.\nThey also provide zero amenities for purchase. Most Korean spas have razors, slippers,towels, face masks, additional add-ons to make your stay pleasant. None of that was found here.. only hairdryers.\nSo basically, We paid $175 each to get a body scrub to take two showers and sit in a steam room. Not to worry though, at least I had a dry head when I ventured out in the cold. This place is a joke. Never again.",

  "text": "Last night my husband and I had an INCREDIBLE dinner at iNDO! It was such a pleasant, relaxing evening spent savoring the most wonderful flavors in a beautifully designed space. \n\nOur server Joss was so kind and also happy to make food and drink recommendations for the evening. After hearing some recommendations, we went with them and ordered the Makai Ceviche, King Crab Nigiri, Seafood Laksa, and A5 Wagyu Nigiri. \n\nThe Makai Ceviche arrived first. It's a smaller dish, but packs so much flavor! Leche de tigre, herb salad, shallots, puffed hominy, and aji amirillo make up this delicious dish. It's a wonderfully refreshing cool dish to enjoy on hot summer nights. And those puffed hominy are so good!\n\nNext the King Crab Nigiri arrived. The nigiri arrives with two pieces, so it's perfect to share on a date. Joss told us the King Crab had just been flown in that day, and you could definitely taste the freshness! The sweetness of the crab had a wonderful contrasting taste with the saltiness of the nori. \n\nMy favorite dish of the evening, the Seafood Laksa, arrived next. I swear each dish the kitchen delivered got more and more incredible as the evening went on because my goodness the flavors in this dish are unrivaled. The curry broth and chili oil boasted intense, savory flavors that paired perfectly with the crispy salmon, PEI mussels, prawns and ikura (red caviar). The glistening ikura were like savory little boba popping into subtle savory tastes of salty brine and oil. My husband and I were in heaven slowly enjoying this dish down to the last drop of broth in the bowl.\n\nOur last entree we ordered was the A5 Wagyu Nigiri. Not only did this nigiri arrive looking like it should be on the cover of Feast or Sauce magazine, but it also tasted amazing as well. Slivers of perfectly-cooked Wagyu Beef topped these beautiful bundles of rice. So, so good. \n\nDuring our meal my husband and I enjoyed three different cocktails: The Art of Eight Limbs, Shikoku 75, and Enchante. The Art of Eight Limbs consists of plantation pineapple rum, orgeat, coconut milk, Thai basil, lime, and bird's eye chili tincture. It's a wonderful drink for those who love themselves some sweetness. The Shikoku 75 is made up of jinro 24, st. hillaire \"blanquette di limoux,\" yuzu, and popping lemon boba. This refreshing citrus cocktail boasts crisp lemon-fresh flavor with a hint of sweetness as well as a lemony finish when you get to the popping boba at the bottom of your glass. For those who like a stronger drink, the Enchante is for you! Arette blanco, tamarind, Thai tea, and basil make up this strong spiced cocktail. \n\nWe concluded the evening with a Fluffy Ice on Coconut Custard. Treat yourself to dessert and try this for the most creamy, cold, coconut goodness your tastebuds will possibly ever experience. \n\nOverall, I can't recommend iNDO enough to anyone and everyone! The staff, the food, the drinks, and the space are all just incredible. PLEASE, please, please do yourself a favor and experience this sensational venture by Chef Nick Bognar! You won't regret it!",

Mmm cheese. Makes me happy. \nIve tried several and they are all good, some heavier than others. My top 2 are the alligator sausage and the orginal(4 cheeses on sourdough served double decker style) The bread is thick and  super buttery. This location also has creole creamery shakes if you want to live it up. \nThey also offer salads for the timid. I wish they had a drive thru but then again I do want to live past 40. I like how they are called 'adult grilled cheese'.  Thanks to them, its now my favorite thing about being an adult.",

It was a smaller portion but just enough for me.  You got plenty of shrimp too!!!  At 519 calories it was perfect but a little pricey.\nThe hubby got the Mushroom Ravioli in a cream sauce.  Highly recommend this!!!\nAnd then the 5 Cheese Ziti Forno which is always a classic favorite. \nOur server Dee was very attentive.\nWe took advantage of the Take home a Pasta for $5.  Put them in the freezer for later!!!!",

  "text": "This place is heaven.\n\nCame to NOLA in August 2012 and Creole Creamery was one of our destination spots, even if it was a bit far from the French Quarter. We spent the day walking around the neighborhoods nearby and exploring the graveyard (which, incidentally, we came to because the graveyard where the Voodoo Queen is buried was closed to the public that day. Something about someone breaking the lock on the gate there). When done exploring, we were all drenched in sweat and craving both water and some ice cream. It was an added bonus when we were hit with the AC upon walking in. \n\nThe shop itself is old fashioned. Warm atmosphere, welcoming employees, and that AC...can't complain when you come in during the summer! \n\nI love that they have samplers here. There were so many flavors that I couldn't decide on which to settle on. So I picked a bunch!\n\nI don't remember all the flavors I got, but what stood out was the Blueberry Mojito flavor. Everyone I was with tried to steal this scoop from me, much to my chagrin. If I had known this was so amazing, I would have skipped the sampler and gotten a cone with this stuff. It's like crack. SO good! And I loved that it was specifically a summer flavor. The other flavors were equally delicious, but didn't hold a candle to the blueberry one. \n\nWater here is $1.50 and is ice cold when you get it. They have an ice cream challenge here that my friend and I were thinking about trying, but the risk of brain freeze made us chicken out. Maybe next time, if I ever come back to NOLA...",

  "text": "if you're going to cheu noodle bar for ramen, you might be disappointed. \n\nthe owners, ben and shawn, have their philosophy written flat out as you enter the small restaurant. they state that they are two white guys trying to run an asian fusion restaurant, and that although their cuisine is informed by asian tradition, it is not defined by it. basically, have an open mind and don't think about whether this is \"authentic\" asian food or not. if you take the food at face value instead of trying to define or categorize it, you can judge the food simply for how it tastes, not how it is SUPPOSED to taste.\n\nnow, with that in mind, i ordered the brisket noodles to try something different. the brisket was a bit dry, but the matzo ball and kimchi were good on their own. but i felt like together, the flavors didn't mesh well and the dish never came together as a whole.\n\nthe miso ramen was actually decent (if non-traditional), but i've had so many bowls of miso ramen in my life that it truly has to be spectacular to blow me away.\n\nmy vegetarian friend had the cold sesame 3.0 and said she really enjoyed it. i love soy as much as the next vegetarian, but i'm never one to opt out of a meat dish when it's available.\n\nif you don't want to wait, grab a few of your friends (3 or more to be exact) and make an early dinner reservation (between 5-6:30pm). we made a 5:30pm reservation and didn't have to wait at all.\n\noverall, my impression is that the food is decent and the service is excellent. but i probably won't be back, because it is a little too \"fusion\" aka experimental. and my palate prefers something more traditional asian in taste.",

Despite the reviews, we came. I've been to Golden Corrals all over this country and I feel like I can't count on this company to deliver quality, delicious food. Well, not here. It's ok to satisfy an appetite but nothing extravagant......nothing impressive. \n\nI'll pass next time. I haven't found a good home cooked buffet style in this city. Some body help!! Mississippi Belle didn't fell short. So did Golden Corral. \n\nService: it depends on who you get. Sometimes it's good and sometimes not so good. \n\nMy question: can somebody please clean the ladies restroom???! I declare its a luxury anymore to find a clean restroom (sigh). \n\nAnyway, the next time ill pass. The price has increased. For $50, we could've eaten at a decent place, with a decent atmosphere with clean bathrooms.",

But my experience is very limited to sitting at the bar, chatting with Jessica the excellent barkeep, and thus the service was impeccable.\n\n3 stars--There was only a handful of taps for brew, I had the Yards Brawler...pretty good stuff...close to something I would have more preferred, but it was fine for one day.  Also they had an adequate bottled beer selection and wines looked decent too. \n\n5 stars--To start, the Thai mussels rivaled any mussels you would find in the tri-state area.  The coconut curry broth was a velvety smooth base which clung to each mussel, was not watery, nor overly spiced but just perfect.  The mussels were so tender, perfect texture, no grit, and definitely not the \"pungent\" tasting mussels you get at other places.\n\n3 stars--For a light entree I had the duck salad.  There were 5 medium to small, fairly lean slices of duck over arugula (not much), apples (about a 1/4 apple), a small handful of walnuts, and a tracing of goat cheese in a lightly dressed rosemary vinaigrette.   Flavors were complimentary, the size and price were not.  But it was a good salad.\n\n5 stars--Service, see above\n\nYah, I'm a fan, especially in New Hope where tourist traps with mediocre food await your wallet.",

The smell of the interior of the restaurant is heavily smoky.\n\nI came here with my family and my parents in law. Service was friendly, if under-staffed. We were able to walk in at 7:30pm on a Friday and get seated right away.\n\nThere is a kids menu, but it doesn't exist in physical form. My kids got the mac and cheese with a side of tater tots (I had wanted them to get broccoli, but the restaurant was out of it). They loved the tater tots but the asiago mac and cheese was too fancy for them, I'm afraid.\n\nWe started with the bacon wrapped shrimp, which were excellent. I had the \"pick two\" with brisket, spare ribs, collard greens, and green beans. The brisket was passable. The spare ribs were excellent, very meaty, with a nice dry rub. I really enjoyed both the collard greens and green beans. My husband had the pork 3 ways, and he said that the spare ribs were much better than the baby back ribs, and that the pulled pork was better than average. He enjoyed the green beans too. His other side was a side salad (there's an upcharge for that), which was pretty generic looking.\n\nThey have a full bar, although we stuck to beer (or hard seltzer). The kids had juice, and my daughter complained that her orange juice tasted funny.\n\nThe parking lot is too small for the size of the restaurant, so you might have to park in the grass off the street.",

I had heard so many glowing recommendations for this fabled frozen custard that when the time came to try it, I nearly turned back for fear that it would be nothing like what I had imagined.\n\nFortunately I was wrong.\n\nI'm relatively certain the recipe includes fairy dust, unicorn breath, and the egg of a golden goose, because no other ingredients could possibly make such a creamy, rich, robust, and flavorful frozen custard.\n\nThe staff was VERY patient with me as I hemmed and hawed, and asked about nearly every type of concrete on the menu.  When I finally decided on the Tadad (magical custard mixed with chopped Dad's oatmeal cookies - SO good) I knew I had made the right decision.\n\nMy only regret is that there are only two locations, and neither are in Indianapolis.",

This is just not how concrete is supposed to be so it is just very disappointing, especially for a place that prides itself on serving \"concrete\" custard. We got the TeDad's, peppermint, brownie, and pistachio. The peppermint was actual crushed peppermint candy so it's very minty. I didn't try the pistachio but it was green and not just nuts folded into vanilla custard. We've also tried the mint and root beer, which are syrups mixed in. The mint was ok but the root beer was not very good. The flavors were fun to try but we'd get something else next time to explore.",

  "text": "Heeeere's a surprise. Sicillian Pasta Kitchen is a pretty decent place for Italian comfort food!  My parents have been talking about this place for years though every time I'm in Edmonton, it never works out for us to go here.  \n\nJust to make sure everyone reading this understands.  This isn't Sicilian style food, it's North American Italian comfort food.  It's also not Italian fine dining fusion either.  We're talking lasagna, fettuccini alfredo, spaghetti and meatball type of place.  On those cold Albertan nights when you need a hot carb-y meal to stick to your bones while your car heats up.  \n\nI had the gnocchi with cream sauce and then they broiled mozzarella cheese on top.  I know, super healthy, right?  However, the gnocchi were soft, the sauce had just the right creaminess to it, and who doesn't like cheese broiled on top of anything?  \n\nIt's a casual family restaurant.  Dining room is a decent size with several sections though you are fairly close to other diners so they can fit more people so it's not really an intimate experience but better than a Cheescake Factory or PF Changs.  It's average in decor.  It was a Thursday evening around 5:00 PM and there was ample seating when we arrived, however, the restaurant was full when we left.  It's in a small strip mall that doesn't offer a ton of parking but is likely adequate if the restaurant isn't busy.  They take reservations.\n\nIt's a good option for the area if you are looking for a casual place with reasonably priced, larger portioned Italian food and a great place for kids too.",

Server was awesome, funny and swayed me towards the bottomless mimosas, which are $15.  At $8 per regular glass, after 2 you've already got your money's worth, so I opted for that.\n\nWe started with the short rib nachos, then had our entrees:  1 burger, 1 breakfast burrito and 1 chicken and waffles.  The portions are definitely a tad smaller than they should be for the prices, but everything was very tasty, albeit a little underseasoned.  I think the nachos were actually my favorite, but they can't hold a candle to Los Camaradas.  My breakfast burrito was huge and was filled with a yummy peppery hash (plus I got a heaping mound of salty, addicting fries on the side), but they cut the burrito in half before serving, which is a huge pet peeve.\n\nMy friend liked her burger, but didn't love it.  Presentation was just meh, as well.  My BF liked his chicken and waffles (and grits), but without the requested berry jam on the side he probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.  Still not as good as The Dutch.  Plus, the plate was too small to maneuver around to eat off.\n\nOverall, I'd be back if I was in the area.  I would like to come back for dinner and cocktails one night and sit inside.",

I've been in for brunch twice and was pleased on each visit.  \n\nMost recently, I had the White Chocolate Belgium Waffle, served with Honey Butter and maple syrup.  It was so sweet and delicious!   I knew I wanted something to balance out the sweet so I got a couple eggs on the side.  These also came with home fries and I was pleased to see I was only charged 4 bucks for this addition.  \n\nThey have a full bar, and plenty to offer.  The atmosphere seems a bit formal, but the friendly servers take the formal edge off.  I'd like to see more brunch options, but the main menu has a lot to choose from including Chicken and Waffles, which I see in my near future!\n\nService was a little slow on our last visit, but we did walk right in the door at opening so that might be expected.

I had the half rack of wet Thai stylist ribs for only $14.  When the ribs came out I wa impressed with how big they were.  They looked like a full rack to me.  The meat was very tender and the food was filled with flavor.  \n\nNow, I'm from  Texas & we are big on our BBQ.  I was impressed.  The food was great and extremely affordable.  My plate would have been double the price easily back at home.  I definitely got my moneys with & will stop by the next time I'm back in town.  The dirty rice was so de-lish that I wanted to place a big order to take home with me.  The closest we have to dirt rice is Pop Eyes.   I'm embarrassed to say that we ate every bite & did not have left overs to take home.  The staff was super friendly and the restaurant was clean & beautiful.  I loved how you could see the kitchen though the glass window.  Very classy appeal.   5 Stars to you Zea!",

Very few restaurants have made their way into my cell phone contacts but Black Thorn has most definitely made the list.\n\nI've had Chicago style pizza many times, and would have to say that it's not exactly the same, but exhibits some similar qualities:\n1) It takes forever to bake, so order at least 45 minutes in advance (hence why I keep their number in my phone!)\n2) the sauce is very thick and tomato-like\n3) the crust is thick, but not Chicago style thick\n\nBesides that, Black Thorn pizza has a taste all it's own. And it's delicious! Paired with a pitcher of beer and it's a gorge-fest for sure! \n\nThe only reason it's a 4 and not a 5-star review is because it's usually really smokey in the restaurant and their call for pick up system is somewhat archaic. The loud speaker from which orders are called is very difficult to hear/understand...I think it's from 1975. Other than that, it's a \"must\" in STL anytime.",

I come here on a fairly regular basis and don't see that changing any time soon.\n\nWhen I first moved to Edmonton a year and a half ago, I was told by countless people that I \"needed\" to try the chai at Remedy. Once I finally made a point to check it out, I completely understood the enthusiasm. It's absolutely fantastic. I especially enjoy the Kashmiri chai which is flavoured with pistachios and rose petals. Divine! Plus it's decaf so you don't need to worry about grabbing one before bed.\n\nAs for the food, I find Remedy to be hit or miss. You can order the same dish two days in a row and end up eating something that tastes completely different. Sometimes it's fantastic and sometimes it's nothing particularly special. It's never been very bad though. I do love how vegan/vegetarian friendly the menu is. I tend to order the vegan butter chicken whenever I go here for food. Yummy!\n\nMy biggest issue is how slow the service can be. I honestly don't really blame the staff for this one. I don't know how the managers can justify having one person on the counter on a Friday night. It's ALWAYS busy at Remedy so this shouldn't be a surprise. Don't go here if you're in a hurry at all.",

The line moved fairly quickly and I noted that if we had gone next door to Five Guys, we'd be waiting just as long.\nIt seems we hit them on a bad day though - they were out of chips, lettuce (and later, cheese, but luckily that was after we already got our food).  Also, when we got to pay, we ordered margaritas, but then learned that they were also out of stuff to make margaritas.  Hmm. Oh, and there were no forks, only spoons.  I guess it was a delayed shipment, but it's surprising that a business open for a few months is still running into these problems, especially since this is a chain.\nAnyway, all that aside, the burritos were awesome. We both got steak burritos (and a negra modelo).  I got the corn, guacamole, the hottest sauce, black beans, and brown rice on mine.  The corn was super sweet, the guacamole was not skimped on (which almost makes the $1.75(!!!) worth it), and the sauce was awesomely spicy (but I did put some chipotle Tabasco on a few bites).  The pinto beans looked a little weird, but I typically go with black beans anyway.  And, although the rice wasn't crunchy, I think it could have been cooked for just a tab longer.\nThe restaurant was a little dirty, but I'm not surprised - there were so many people and tables were getting snatched up so quickly, there wasn't really any time for them to get cleaned.\nIt's too bad that you can't have your margarita or beer out on the patio, it'd be nice on a warm day.\nAnyway, the wait is worth it, but don't go in expecting a quick experience.",

Because we tried to come by twice during the week and it was always after a full day of walking around and we were looking for something a little sweet before heading back to our hotel. But it was always closed. Finally we came back on a weekend (a little earlier but it opens till 11 on weekends, I think) and it was packed. They're located inside a jazz courtyard area where a jazz band was playing live. You can just stand around and watch/listen or there's tables scattered all over if you wanted food from Café Beignet. We walked up to the counter though and just got an order of beignets to go. It took a little while to come out - it was busy and they do offer other foods besides beignets and I'm sure they make it to order since it was piping hot when it came out. Also they first brought it out on a plate before we corrected them and they went back and put it in a bag. As for the beignets themselves, did not stack up to the Café du Monde at all. The batter must've not been thoroughly mixed because there were like little clumps in the dough. It was a very odd texture and I didn't particularly enjoy it. Other than that - lots of powdered sugar and taste-wise, it was good. Also it's a bit more expensive than du Monde's. Might come back to try there food food but I think I will stick to the original Café du Monde for their beignets.",

So being the burger lover that I am I instantly bookmarked and planned to attend before one of my next concert extravaganzas. And while trying it out before I went to see Lykke Li led to a 3.5 star experience mostly due to me ordering wrong, I do have to curve a bit higher to to their commitment to local and organic goods, and their eclectic selection of burgers.\n\nAs son as I read the menu and saw meat burgers made from beef, wild boar, goat, bison and then some; and veggie burgers made from either black bean or sweet potato & wild rice, my mind was instantly blown by the prospects. Especially when I was gazing upon the eclectic artwork of the menu and crazy interior decor that the place had to offer in the process.But ultimately I went with the Grindhouse for the Elk meat, country bacon, manchego cheese, and paprika mayo that it had to offer. But while it certainly was a filling burger, it just didn't offer any of the spicy or gamy tastes that I was expecting from such a combination. In fact I hardly tasted both the manchego and country bacon; and as a former cheese monger who has sold Manchego's of various ages, and an avid bacon addict, that was a serious first.\n\nBut despite the burger that was devoid of the flavors and ingredients that I was expecting, Bareburger won me over with everything else. while not the best I've had the side of fries were flavorful and plentiful. The spicy pickles that were more than just cucumber packed a sufficient and sour wallop, and the classic lemonade was quite refreshing.\n\nWith 14 signature burgers & a big time create your own burger menu, 6 salads & 5 signature sandwiches, and all kinds of milkshakes and fountain sodas; Bareburger has plenty to offer for both carnivores and veggie lovers alike. And while my first burger didn't deliver as expected, I'm definitely enticed enough to give it a few more attempts to come!",

Just like we used to get 30+ years ago.  Wish I could've taken you here.  I miss you (probably why I'm still always on the hunt for the best Chile Rellenos - I think I found them, but I'll keep trying, just in case).\n\nThe beans were fantastic, and the tortilla - wow!\n\nThis is some good chow!!!",

Yes, I am guilty of grocery store sushi, but in all honesty, theirs is not bad!\n\nThis",

  "text": "Service was absolutely amazing. I can't not speak highly enough about how wonderful the people are at this place. We came without a reservation and were informed that they could take us right then, but they had a table coming in an hour. PERFECT! :-) I took a seat while my husband went driving around. I ordered right away so I wouldn't take up a lot of their time. Unfortunately, my husband spend literally half an hour trying to find parking. I requested the food be packed to go because I was afraid I would run out of time they gave us. Then right when I asked them to pack it up, he found a spot. The server was so kind and made us a whole new dish. I can not thank them enough!!!! You can tell when someone is genuinely nice vs nice in front of your face and then when they get to the back, want to throw a tray at the wall. At the end of our meal, they apologized (I don't even know why!!!) They said sorry for making us feel rushed (which they didn't) and even gave us a complimentary dessert to go. This is what I call true service. \n\nOnto the food - This is a place that seems like they change their menu often (based on what is available and fresh), so I do not want to get into much detail on each dish we ordered, but I must say that everything we ate was DELICIOUS! The risotto was nice and light and so flavorful. All of their foods had a balance of sweet, salty, savory, etc. It was just perfect. The scallops were seared wonderfully and the beef was cooked to perfection. I can not tell you how much I loved it here. Oh, and the muffin bread....OMG! It's like crack. I loved it. Mmmm, so buttery and moist and flaky. I hope they serve this on an everyday basis!\n\nNext time, i will make sure to make a reservation. :-) Thank you for such an amazing date night with my husband!",

  "text": "If you ask the tourists, they will tell you ACME is the best place to get oysters. If you ask the locals they will tell you skip ACME, don't waste your time- because DRAGO'S is the place to be!!!\n\nMy fiancé and I stopped into Drago's on a Thursday around noon for nothing more than oysters. Lucky for us we scored spots at the oyster grill and got to watch the quick shucking, prep and rotation of oysters on and off the grill. The oysters BBQ-ing on the grill looked mouth wateringly delicious, soaking up the buttery, garlic, herb parmesan sauce poured on top. We ended up ordering a dozen raw ($13) and a dozen chargrilled oysters ($18).\n\nThe raw oysters here huge compared to anything we've seen on the west coast. They were served with lemon and a cocktail sauce. The oysters were fresh and tasted really good. \n\nThe chargrilled oysters were everything you could imagine and more. They were served hot off the grill and dripping with sauce with a side of garlic bread. You could taste the grilled flavor of the oyster with the buttery concoction. I think my fiancé ended up wiping the plate clean of the sauce with his garlic bread. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waiter was prompt and made sure we had everything we needed. Believe it or not, as much as we wanted to stay and eat more we were in and out in about 30 minutes. We were on vacation and had more places to see and try! I highly recommend trying the oysters at Drago's even if your have your mind set on visiting ACME and Felix's. One other observation we made was right after eating at Drago's on our way to Deanie's we walked passed ACME and their line was ridiculously long. Avoid the wait, go to Drago's for better oysters and excellent service.",

  "text": "Bubble tea is as delicious as it is addictive, and there is no better place to sample its sweet taste than at The Tea Cottage.  The no-frills, non-descript interior of wooden chairs and tables are accented by the crates of fresh fruits and boxes of syrup bottles that line the walls.  Behind the counter there are usually two server working furiously to keep up with the demand and lineups.\n\nBut what exactly is \"bubble tea\" you ask?  Don't let the name fool you.  Many of the drinks don't even have tea in them.  The \"bubble\" part refers to the spaces in the wide straw between the soft balls of tapioca that one slurps up in the process of drinking.  The tapioca is referred to by the Asian name \"Sago\" and are chewy, golden-brown balls made from the starch of sweet potatoes.  They also look like bubbles, which is an alternate explanation for the drink's name. For people who dislike the texture, the drinks can be made without sago but it's worth trying - the sago is essentially flavourless and a lot of fun to chew!\n\nThe drinks themselves have a syrup or fresh fruit base, mixed with milk, juice, or tea.  They are 32 ounces and shaken in a plastic cup, over which a colourful thin plastic cover is attached.  When the drink is ready, the customer stabs the very wide straw through the cover, and enjoys pure taste pleasure.\n\nSyrup-based drinks are very sweet and available in a variety of fruit flavours.  There are also coffee varieties, from plain coffee to mocha, to coffee with almond.  By far the most popular drinks are the ones with fresh fruit.  Mixed with ice, fruit, syrup, and the milk, juice, or tea base, the creation is essentially a smoothie with a sweet kick.   Some of the varieties include strawberry, cantaloupe, and avocado.  Yes, avocado is a fruit, and it makes a very tasty smoothie - a nutty flavour with just a hint of sweetness.\n\nSince bubble tea originated in Taiwan, there are also a lot of uniquely Asian flavours to try, such as the gritty and vanilla-like taro root and lychee.  You can find all of this and more at the Tea Cottage, as well as a variety of hot coffee and tea drinks.  So get adventurous, and you might just find yourself going back for more.",

  "text": "I tried to make a spa appointment for my husband for Father's Day looked on Groupon ans that's how I found this location the price was right but never had a chance to go there because I called over the phone to see if we can make an appointment and the young lady said 3:00pm then she said hold on then she said 3:30pm. I said okay then she asked me if she can call me back I said sure because I was driving and my husband was trying to get the information. Then she calls me back and says can you come at 4 Mrs. T and I said sure so me and my husband was on our way there 13 minutes away soon as we pulled into the parking lot she called me and said Mrs T can you come at 7:00pm I said enough is enough no thank you thanks for trying to get us in. Because which it was on a humbug this was a first time that I called she hould've looked in the book and said that the time was booked instead of me keep holding on and keep calling me back and forth the price was right we might try it again but for right now we're getting ready to go have something to eat and we might try then in a later date. And We might go and find another massage later today. And what's so crazy about it is we found a place I told my husband I just want to take a peek at it took a picture and the parking lot is not even crowded I believe they don't have enough staff but I would like to come back and give them a try. And that's why I gave them a two star if we have went and got a massage and how the people treated us then it probably would have been more but for right now is it to start limit and she tried to get us in and that's another reason why she. And what's so crazy about it is I came all the way from Philly getting my car checked out at the PACIFICO dealer and I ask my husband would he like to go get a massage and that's why we went over to New Jersey.We have to find somewhere over here to eat and also I would love to still do I massage but hot stone spa will not have our money today. I had to get back on here and to let y'all know don't you know the hot stone spa text me and told me that they are ready for us. And our appointment is at 5:00pm. I told my husband check this text out which I was thinking it was from my job and we had just came from eating and doing a little bit of shopping do they really think that I'm coming back their today at the all this confusion heck to the no I'm getting ready to go home pull my shoes off drink a glass of wine and relax. I'll see y'all on a next go-round. And the person that was answering the phone is really confused and y'all need to get her straightened out because you're going to lose a lot of customers.",

  "text": "I don't know what the big deal is about this brand. Maybe you have to 'be there' as an Elite Yelper in the newest store to get the full experience. I dunno, but somehow I doubt it. \n\nNothing wrong with this location just as there's nothing inherently WRONG with this ice cream, but none of the flavors I tried made me want to keep buying it. The first one I ever tried was the Brambleberry Crisp. Did not even finish the pint. The 'crisp' part was annoying to eat, very hard in comparison to the other ingredients and I did not find the fruit swirl to be especially tasty.\n\nThe Darkest Chocolate, which I bought at Whole Foods, was fine but I will continue buying Haagen Dazs chocolate over this. I think it tastes better.\n\nPistachio Macaron, also purchased at Whole Foods, was too sweet and there was a dearth of pistachios. Again, I'll take Haagen Daz Pistachio over this, as it is absolutely loaded with large pistachio pieces, the flavor base is mild and it doesn't put me into a sugar coma. Talenti Pistachio gelato is a second runner up to Haagen Daz's for a full nut experience.\n\nSure, it's nice that Jeni Bauer has been around since the late 1990, started out small and is now nationwide. Kudos to an enterprising, hard working woman. Even though I don't eat ice cream very often, $12 a pint is an extravagance for me, especially as none of the flavors appeal in the least.\n\nTaste is highly subjective and clearly Ms. Bauer has an enormous fan base that doesn't include me.",

In addition to the Crazy Chaat I've had before, I also quite like the Punjabi Chaat -- it has the crispy bits and sweetness I like.

  "text": "A late Sunday lunch at this petite eatery came at an ease. There were plenty of available tables to choose from. \n\nWe ordered the yakisoba with lamb sausage and shio koji corn ramen. The yakisoba was extremely heavy with spices, snap peas, mushrooms, and cucumber raita. The sausages were tasty and had a crispy texture. The cucumber raita was thick and yogurt-like. The contents went well with each other, but in hindsight, I wished I had ordered the cold noodles instead. This yakisoba is more suitable for the cold weathers. At the end of my meal, I was perspiring. (To be fair, I think the air conditioner could've been turned higher. It was a 90 degree day and the restaurant was overly warm.) The shio koji corn ramen was a lighter fare with arugula, enoki, corn, and roasted tomato. It was an interesting and innovative mix.",

They have a selection of balloons and will make you a balloon bouquet.\n\nThere's a decent wine/beer/liquor section in the center of the store.\n\nIn general, prices are higher here, but the selection is usually decent, and products are fresh.  If you can only shop in the evenings, go on a Tuesday.  I think their newest deliveries arrive on Tuesdays, it's the day after the latest sale has started, and it's not very busy.",

  "text": "I had been asked to check out this place, but for some reason had never gotten around to it. Coincidentally, a friend asked if I wanted to go, so off we went! I am so happy I visited this restaurant, because the whole experience was great. You know how you get great service and not so great food or vice versa? I appreciate that this was the whole package and wish I found that at more places. I am a little sad that it took me so long, considering it is right down the street from my house; but now that I have been, it has been added to the list. \n\nYou know how some days you just want a nice cold Rum Punch after work? It happened to be that day, and it was the best rum punch ever. Rum punch may not be important to you, but it is my favorite drink. \n\nI suggest making a reservation, so you can be seated upon arrival. I chose to sit inside because I don't like to melt in the summer.  However, during spring, autumn, or winter, sitting outside would be splendid. \n\nI was seated and my server was Phil (Hi Phil!) - he was great! I had a couple questions about different things on the menu and which he preferred, and he knew the items inside/out. We started with Ceviche. I am no ceviche connoisseur, but it is by far the best I have had yet. It was so... perfect. Refreshing, light, and I would return just for the ceviche. Did I mention the ceviche was superb? It makes me smile just thinking about it.\n\nI ordered the crispy skin salmon, which comes with green beans and fingerling potatoes. I need to tell you about the Poblano citrus salsa - it made the dish. I love salmon, and I love skin-on salmon; crispy skin-on salmon? Oh yes indeed. The Poblano citrus salsa though - I need this in my life. It was just so... heavenly.\n\nMy friend had the taco salad. I didn't taste hers, nor did I want to; I was too busy with my own food. She cleaned her plate, mentioned how good it was. One can presume it was good, since there was little conversation once the food arrived. \n\nA few more rum punches, a couple more margaritas for my friend, and we were satiated. But alas, there was dessert to be had! If you know either of us, you know we both have a slight sweet tooth (ok fine: *I* have a sweet tooth). I ordered the chocolate ganache and she ordered the flourless chocolate. The flourless chocolate was good; but I need you to know the ganache was decadent and rich and makes your sweet tooth sing. The desserts are handmade - e.g. made by hand from scratch. Upon recollection, I only got one bite because my friend ate all of my ganache. \n\nThank you for a wonderful evening!",

  "text": "Before I met my husband I thought I knew what fine dining was, but I just knew what fine dining was in Colorado. \n\nOn our first trip to New Orleans, many years ago, he took me here for dinner. We had a six course meal of the most petite and perfect courses, from oysters prepared 3 ways to sweet potato soup, salad greens, fish, white chocolate dessert. I can't remember all of the details because it was ten years ago, but now every time we go to NOLA we make a point to eat here and have never been disappointed, even after Katrina!! \n\nI distincly remember being surprised that we had eaten a full six courses, but they were such perfect portions that we never felt stuffed, just sated.\n\nSave your pennies, it costs us $100/person with alcohol and tip, but this is truly a memorable experience. They have an impressive port selection too. \n\nService: if you want to know what it feels like to have a personal butler, eat here. They must have three people serving each table, it seems like they anticipate your needs before they even occur to you! \n\nEpicure Tip: they sell a cookbook, buy it. I have made a number of recipes from it and they are easy and great, plus it tells you about the history of the family that owns the restaurant. \n\nEpicure tip #2- if you're broke but still want to check it out, the bar serves food too- you can get some apps and ambiance for $40\n\nWe will be back 02/08, I should make my resy now 'cause they book up!\n\nEdit 02/10/08 - It is still the greatest dining experience I've ever had: house-cured salmon, caesar salad, corn and shrimp chowder, sauteed spinach, asparagus with Boursin melted over it (I never would have thought these two would go so well together but am going to try this at home, it was awesome!) , two glasses of Jordan Cab, strawberry shortcake- and I still could walk! I love that they portion and pace everything perfectly so you can taste all that they are capable of while still feeling comfortable. Tab was again $100/head and I have no regrets- it was worth every single penny and we will be back again in two more years.",

  "text": "For a restaurant week date night, I decided it was time to try Bistro La Baia. I have passed this cute little Italian spot plenty of times walking through my neighborhood and checked out the mixed reviews here on Yelp. My boyfriend and I decided we'd see for ourselves what we thought of Bistro La Baia.\n\nWe were easily able to make our reservation by calling about a week in advance. While on the phone they let us know that they are BYOB. I noticed that past reviews note that it is cash only, but we learned that they do accept cards now. Upon our arrival for our Sunday night dinner, we were seated immediately, and brought water and bread with oil and balsamic.\n\nContrary to other reviews, the service was extremely prompt. We placed our full orders from starters to desserts and within minutes our first dishes were brought out. We were so shocked by the quick service that I checked the time, and learned we had been there 15 minutes when our entrees arrived. The entire experience start to finish took 48 minutes, but we did not feel rushed at all. I was seriously blown away considering what I had read from others regarding slow service being a big issue.\n\nTo eat, we started with the Eggplant Rollatini and Arancini. The Arancini was not crisp on the outside, but the flavor was good and the sauce was delicious. The Eggplant Rollatini was delicious and similar to the arancini, the sauce was perfection. I'm super picky when it comes to tomato sauce and I would genuinely eat this with a spoon. For entrees, my boyfriend had the Pappardelle con Salsiccia. The pasta was fresh, sausage was flavorful, and the sauce was delicious. The dish was very hot temperature wise as well, which was great because we made our walk over in the snow. For my entree, I had the Chicken Parmesan which was a gamble on my part. I tend to skip ordering chicken parm out, because I'm really picky. However, the picture of the dish on their website intrigued me so I went for it. I'm so glad that I did! The chicken was not crispy, but it was thinly sliced and portioned well. I ordered a side of veggies with it instead of the pasta. The veggies were so well seasoned! For dessert, we tried the Chocolate Cake and Panna Cotta. Both were great, but we both preferred the chocolate cake.\n\nFrom start to finish, the service was attentive, the food was delicious, and the portions for the price were perfect. We're super excited to return with friends and enjoy this neighborhood BYOB gem!",

Located on Papworth Street in Metairie, this small stand is just a hundred feet off the \"river side\" of Veterans Memorial Blvd.  In the world of NOLA /Metairie snowball stands, this place is relatively new and offers most standard flavors; including a dual flavored soft serve ice cream machine.\n\nThe only flavor I have sampled so far was the chocolate cream; which was pretty good.  The chocolate was not so sweet that all you tasted was sugar; so the real chocolate taste came through.  They've got the ice perfect, and you'll never confused this with shaved ice, as it literally disappears as soon as it hits your tongue.  I also had the opportunity to try the vanilla soft serve ice cream and it was also good to go.\n\nThe best thing about Lou-Lou's is the location, as it's one of the few locations located at the foot of Vets.  And there was also no real line to speak of, so I was able to walk right up and get my fix.",

  "text": "I returned to Szechuan House, the hidden treasure of a restaurant found on Rt. 33 in Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey, for another mouth numbing meal last week.  The last time I was there I underwent a root canal the next day without need of additional anesthesia.  It was that good! \n\nYes. This is a joke, but you might not think it funny if you don't take the warning seriously. If you are thinking \"Mexican\" spicy, you are in for a rude awakening.  Szechuan spicy is an entirely different dimension of heat.  I love Jalapenos and Habaneros, and even Ghost Peppers, and you can pile them onto my Flautas without me blinking.  Put an equivalent amount of Szechuan peppercorns, hot chili oil, and those cute little red Chinese peppers into a dish, and your review goes from 5 Star to 5 Alarm.\n  \nI love it, but it is an acquired taste. As someone said about this style food, \"Numb is a flavor.\"\n \nLast week, I was surrounded by Dan Dan Noodles with Minced Pork and Chili Vinaigrette, Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette, Amazing Eggplant (that's the name), and Hunan Beef.  \n\nThe Dan Dan's were spaghetti diameter, and had a nice ground pork sauce with a mild spicy quotient.  Very tasty and a nice start to the meal. (4 Star/3 Alarm)\n\nThe Steamed Dumplings with Chili Vinaigrette was found in the Szechuan Delicacies part of the menu toward the back page.  Six fairly large, hand stuffed and pinched, with the red chili oil and vinegar for a bath. There was a pleasant sweetness that I experienced before the heat arrived. Not sure how that was done, but it played well on my tongue. (5 Star/4 Alarm)\n\nThe Amazing Eggplant came on a large plate piled with the thin Chinese Eggplant, in a brown, spicy sauce with a light meat base.  This was delicious and stole the show. Tender, medium heat, and addictive. (5 Star/3 Alarm)\n\nHunan Beef came with an equal supply of broccoli in a shining brown Hunanese sauce.  The beef was thin sliced and very tender.  The Chinese chilies swam in the sauce at the bottom of the serving bowl.  Solid choice, if not completely inspiring.\n(4 Star/ 3 Alarm).\n\nThis was a totally satisfying meal, reminding me of my Chengdu daze.  The 5 Alarm dishes were not selected this time as my friends were not accustomed to Szechuan cuisine, and they needed to be broken in slowly.  But, if you are ready for the HEAT, I suggest the Fish Fillet in Hot & Spicy Sauce, the Diced Rabbit with Szechuan Peppercorn Vinaigrette (a cold dish with serious hot), or the Beef in Hot & Spicy Sauce to begin your Vulcan adventure.",

Yesterday's special was half price chicken and waffles ($4.50 say what?!) so of course we had to take advantage of that. They offer a variety of chicken, i.e. tenders, wings, 1/4 white or 1/4 dark, and you can vary the spice level. Add a dipping sauce if you like for $.60, the spiked honey is good, but my fave is still the Ella's favorite. The waffles and chicken we had yesterday were cooked well, the chicken was moist and tender, and we left full and happy. They offer plenty of sides, if you're looking for a more traditional chicken dinner. The soda fountain has some cool options to traditional sodas, and of course they have tea and lemonade. I noticed that they also offer beer and wine, which is pretty cool for a small casual joint, and bonus, they serve local brews from Sun King and Bier Brewery! Yay local! I like this place and I hope they stick around. Great alternative to the other chicken places!",

If I had only ordered the burgers, I would have given Bareburger a higher rating, as my county fair burger (with bison meat) was really delicious! I was excited to try something new, and didn't know what to choose as the menu had bison, elk, and a bunch of other different types of fascinating burgers. My boyfriend \"built his own burger\" with a great beef patty and delicious gluten-free bun. I love how the entire store is organic/natural, GMO-free, and had many vegan and GF options! \n\nHowever, after scarfing down my burger (which was really small for its price--but I guess it's expected for an \"all natural\" burger\"), I ordered a cocktail and sweet fries. The Rachel Carson looked delicious--with homemade lemonade, rosemary, blackberry, and rum--but came out full of ice and really weak. The sweet fries were underwhelming as well, with really soggy interiors and mediocre sauces. The service was a bit uncomfortable as well, as our waiter didn't seem to know what to do and was pretty awkward....",

I've had some great drinks and food at this location and some even better heart to hearts with great friends. The staff are wonderful people, it's close to campus making it an ideal off campus, but still kinda close venue to get away and study. \n\nI find this location is quite busy so you may have to wait a little while to find a table. Over all though I would never pass on an opportunity to hit up remedy, it's pretty rad!",

  "text": "I do not eat much seafood, including oysters, so maybe I'm not the perfect person to represent a review for those who go for this type of food. But, for the friends of those others, listen up! This place feels like a Hometown Buffet with it's minimal decor and tons of basic wooden table and chair seating. You have a million and one waiters running around, yet service is relatively slow. Yet, the prices are $15+ for an entree. I'd give the ambiance a 2; then again, this is a restaurant in a hotel, albeit a Hilton. \n\nAs for the food... My oyster-lovin' friends ordered some of the half-shell (raw) and the charbroiled oysters. The raw ones came out dirty and translucent. They tried a few, realizing the oysters tasted fine but left grit in their mouths. They waited for the waitress and she took them back. We got a second round quickly; they were much cleaner, although the table was still amply dirty from the first round (from melting dirty ice), which I would have thought the waitress should have cleaned since we had no extra napkins (only linen ones on our lap). The second round was cleaner, but still translucent; they gave them a 3-star rating for flavor. \n\nThe charbroiled ones came out after. They said they reminded them of steak, giving them a 4-star rating. I tried one, and aside from the gross texture, it looked better than the raw gremlin-fetus ones and had a decent flavor. Smoky, cheesy, though a bit salty. \n\nI ordered the blackened chicken over linguini with alfredo sauce. The chicken was actually pretty darn good, perhaps a 3.5, though the linguini was overcooked and the alfredo reminiscent of something out of a can. Reheating the leftovers the next day, however, it tasted much better. Somehow the chicken didn't get dry in the microwave, but the pasta dried up and tasted a bit more authentic and less like children's food. \n\nEither way, considering the slow service (though hospitable waitress for us, apologizing for the error of the cook), the bad first attempt at both the raw oysters and my meal, and the pricing and ambiance, I would likely not return and give it an overall 2-star rating.",

Being a food-oriented tourist, I came to here buy some souvenirs for home (chiles, creole seasoning, cajun seasoning, peychaud bitters, etc). You are probably better off buying these things here than at central grocery, which has a huge line of tourists just for muffuletta's and is probably overpriced. \n\nI made the mistake of buying Café Du Monde coffee here (the ubiquitous yellow container). Don't! There is a $3 mark-up on those things so you are cheaper off buying these at Café Du Monde itself.",

Anything you could think of was available for consumption and the dessert area was endless.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the price included all you can drink mimosas and also allows you to sample anything off their made to order brunch menu as well.  \n\nOur extensive group ended up having one of everything at the suggestion of our most amazing server, Sandy.  The best part of this experience, besides the company of my tablemates, was of course Sandy.  She advised she has worked at this establishment for the past 26 years and her jovial and nurturing demeanor was by far well suited to our large party.  Definitely somewhere I will return!",

My husband loves the Pad Se Ew, and we always order the steamed pork potstickers as an appetizer. The food is clearly fresh, authentic, and extremely flavorful.

I told him simply \"Well, I'm from New Mexico, so I'm biased. Yeah, it is.\" The trouble with hype is that it can let you down. Did Blake's know they would be THIS popular within a week of their opening, with lines spilling out onto Speedway, and lines forming out the door? And why? I told the Blake's clerk, who came from New Mexico, that Tucson residents love hamburgers. Do we? Can it explain the insanity over In-N-Out burger when they opened- the lines, even now years later, are insane. Is Blake's a gourmet hamburger? No. Is it the greatest burger I've ever eaten? No. The fries- not amazing, but tasty. Do I really like Blake's, and the flaming hot Hatch green chili? Yeah.. I do- a LOT! Would I stand in lines or drive-thru on the street for it? N!. And I bet with that kind of hype, a lot of people are left saying \"What's the big deal?\" What is the big deal? It's new, everyone talks about it, it's from New Mexico? I hear it even now with In-N-Out burger: some people don't get it. That's the great thing about diversity and having a huge selection of hamburgers in this city to choose from. I have a few go-to places for good, really good burgers. But for fast and quick and delicious spicy green chili burgers (and an occasional burrito), I'll be going to Blake's.\n\nAnd a Nutella milkshake...seriously? Bring it on.",

  "text": "Fleming's periodically offers wine dinners throughout the year. A friend and I attended their \"Wagner Family Wine Experience\" which boasted a 4-course dinner with wine pairings for $99 per guest. The first course was a summer market salad which included shaved brussels sprouts, bacon, walnuts, dried cranberries, pickles, and lemon balsamic vinaigrette. Not only was the salad fresh but it was so richly layered with sweet, savory, and salty flavors. It was paired with: Sea Sun, which is a California Chardonnay. Good pairing overall, because of the crisp and slightly tart wine. The second course was a crispy chickpea and eggplant croquette. Although this course was paired with fresh arugula, smoked chili, and a romesco sauce, both the texture and the flavor profile fell totally flat. It was paired with: Caymus- Suisun, which was the only redeeming part of the 2nd course. It was medium bodied, well-balanced and dark red fruit forward. Next, the third course was the crowd pleaser! It included peppercorn filet mignon with roasted asparagus. The steak was generously hand cut and the asparagus was perfectly prepared. In addition, the plate included zesty cauliflower mash with a chimichurri sauce. There was no extraneous fat on the steak and it was perfectly prepared at medium rare; fork tender too. It was paired with: the Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa. Not only was this wine full bodied, but it was a perfect complement to the savory filet. The fourth and final course was an olive oil cake (which I was not prepared to like). Thankfully, it was nothing like I imagined. Instead, it reminded me of my great grandmother's cast-iron sweet cornbread (score!). Plus, it was accompanied by lemon curd and macerated blueberries - tart, sweet, and rich flavors. A light yet decadent dessert, which was paired with: Emmolo - a sparkling white wine. The wine had both a fragrant nose and palette, which included notes of honeysuckle, lillies, and stone fruit. Overall (and aside from the 2nd course), the food and wine pairings were well executed and thoughtfully combined. It was definitely worth the $99 price tag (gratuity not included).",

  "text": "Uhhh seriously?  I'm shocked at the high reviews.  I will flat out say from the get-go... we are Yogurtland fanatics, so all yogurt places are held up to the Yogurtland standard.\n\n-The price: relatively expensive compared to Yogurtland (Yogurtland is 30 cents an ounce, this place is 38 cents an ounce).\n\n-The yogurt: not firm at all, didn't have the right tart flavor... totally was melting at a faster rate than normal.\n\n-The toppings: meh.  Nothing special.  The fruit was not particularly fresh, and the dry toppings were similar to most joints.\n\n-The service: fine.  Nothing extraordinarily good or bad.\n\nTwo stars, because why go here when we could go to Yogurtland?  It's even worth the drive.  Won't be returning, not worth the money.",

If you enjoy pistachios I would highly recommend the Kashmire chai. But each chai is unique and delightful in its own way. Don't forget to grab a stamp card! \nThe food- to die for.

The breading seemed to be a thick double dipped type and was the same on both. It worked well on the tenders but not on the wings. They may want to revise their recipe and stick to a classic fried chicken recipe that is much thinner. If you don't enjoy dipping chicken in the sauces, I can see how it would be bland. Some people just don't like any sauce on wings. If you are like me, where you love all types of homemade sauces and flavored mayos, this place is for you.",

  "text": "I had my birthday dinner at the Prime Rib tonight and I had a very nice experience.\n\nI walked in the back entrance and was warmly welcomed by a kind lady.\n\nI was then give a very nice seat in the main dining room and the ambiance was great. There were leopard rugs, beautiful leather chairs, live music including many verses of \"Happy Birthday\" and large white tablecloth tables! \n\nOur server, Alex, came over and took our drink orders. I got a ginger splash with a maraschino cherry. Others in the party got a variety of drinks including scotch, Chardonnay and coke.  \n\nAfter a little while, our bread was finally dropped off, though I wish it came a little quicker. Either way, the bread was amazing. There were a variety of options that were all served warm and with freshly whipped butter.\n\nAt about the same time our bread came, we placed our appetizer orders. I decided to get both the house salad and seared ahi tuna, which I shared with another member of the party.\n\nThe appetizers came out very fast and were of great quality. I really enjoyed my house salad and all the toppings were very fresh. Even the dressing was good, especially with the level of creaminess. It took the salad to a whole other level. While the ahi tuna was small for the price, only three pieces for $22, it was good. I gave one piece to another party member. While he liked it, he commented that he wish it came with soy sauce. Personally, I thought it was fine without soy sauce and I especially enjoyed the lemon juice and sesame seeds on top. \n\nFinally, since I was at The Prime Rib, I had to get the prime rib. All I can say is that it was amazing. It was tender and full of flavor. The sesame seeds on top took the dish to a whole other level. It was also very big that I couldn't even eat it all!\n\nWhile I didn't eat too many of the sides, I munched on a few. The potato skins were delicious, they were nice and crispy. Also, the grilled broccoli was great! Other people in the party raved about the sides especially the potato skins. \n\nOthers in the party got tuna and crab (we joked that it was the most fattening thing on the menu). \n\nFor dessert, I got the chocolate sundae. It was very good! It was served in a bowl that was surrounded on the outside by cake and a giant scoop of ice cream on the inside. It was topped off with homemade whipped cream smothered in chocolate sauce, pieces of peanuts and topped with a cherry! I also had a little of the chocolate mousse cake and while it was good, I wouldn't say it was spectacular.\n\nWhile I had a very nice night, there were a few minor downsides. First, the waiter Alex was nice, but made a few minor mistakes. First, two others decided to split the shrimp cocktail, which we informed him about, but it was not split when it was brought out. Also, someone was given a lobster soup for an entree, which he did not order. Everyone at the table was a bit confused on how this mishap happened. \n\nLuckily, the owner came over and easily resolved the problem with the shrimp cocktail. Speaking of him, he was very nice and professional and introduced himself to the table.  \n\nUnfortunately, I was very disappointed with the two hostesses when leaving, they were on their phones and did not even wish me a goodnight. \n\nAltogether, Prime Rib could improve their staff, but they serve superb food! I would definitely recommend!",

  "text": "Good Italian restaurant, but over priced. Taormina's is a nicer Italian restaurant than most other ones in the area for sure, but the problem with it is that is can be very inconsistent at times. The biggest problem with Taormina's is consistency in terms of food quality. I've come here before and the food is great, other times the chicken tastes dried out and not as flavorful as previous visits. My most recent visit here, I got the Chicken Alfredo with Rigatoni; the chicken was dried out and flavorless, and the Alfredo felt like it had been sitting under a hot lamp for a while, not fresh. I had previously gotten the exact same dish, which I though was fantastic, but that was a few weeks before. My friend also was upset with his dish as he got the Chicken Parmesan, in which the chicken was very chewy and not edible. Again he has had it in the past and it was fine. All of this isn't even mentioning the pricing here is expensive. For literally pasta with chicken in it costs me almost $20, and they don't put that much chicken in the dish. Everything here is a la carte, so with your $20+ meal, you don't get any salad or anything, just some bread and peppers. Sometimes here the food is great, other times it is whatever. It's all the luck of the draw.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice in Taormina's; they keep the place very clean and it always looks inviting. The place is pretty small, but they fit a lot of people in there and it doesn't feel too cramped. Service is decent too, never really had a major issue, and whenever their is a problem, the servers seem to be able to fix it somewhat. Basically, if Taormina's priced their meals more reasonably, I'd be a much happier camper, but for the price you pay there, I expect a much better product when I go. I hear the Ivyland location of Taormina's costs even more, so there's that.\n\nFood (B+), Pricing (D+), Atmosphere (B), Service (B)",

  "text": "We had a terrific and unforgettable time at this throwback, classic, over-the-top retro French continental Euro style eatery. The decor is super fun and intimate. You are transported in time by the wooden Parisian style red velvet interior. This is a super fun and romantic spot if you're prepared to kick back and take your time eating and enjoying a night out together with the special people in your life. \n\n* The early bird is a good deal or they run a coupon in the local booklet you can grab around town.. \n* The bread served with your meal is a wonderful warm soft loaf with black and white sesame seeds and a crispy sugar exterior. It's pretty divine my humble opinion..\n* They serve a beautiful traditional salad with a garlicky vinaigrette dressing. Pretty and tasty\n* We did a couple veal dishes and the saucing is heavy, but everything was pretty tasty if not quite spot on.. A little too much sugar sweetness for my palate..\n* The pacing is slow so if you're in a rush.. this may not be for you. But if you can converse and relax you will have a great time visiting and taking it all in. The regulars we ran into here were also very friendly. As were the servers.\n\nUnfortunately we ran out of time for dessert so we'll have to come back..\n\nThis is a family establishment and they take pride in their food, the family recipes, and the history. It's a special place. It is perhaps dated and maybe musty but this is also its charm. It's old school and wonderful.\n\nA couple reviews have noted that it's not strictly French. As the menu subtitle notes it is continental European cuisine and a variety of continental classics are offered from veal, frogs legs, escargot, and French onion soup, to marsalas and schnitzels.\n\nDefinitely one of a kind experience. Good Times Czech Restaurant on Tierra Verde is similarly old school but can't' compete with the decor and romance here. :)",

  "text": "Stopped here on our Route 66 road trip adventure. Going on a Route 66 trip, this is one of the iconic historical places to stop at. My dog and I sure tried to stop at as many places as possible!\n\nI love that this place is dog friendly and that you can order straight from an outside window! Most people seem to ask their frozen custard from the back of their cars. There really isn't any seating here. They have some different types of custard you can order, but they are known for their concretes. You can add in different toppings and order them in different flavors. I ordered a coffee one with almonds and coconut. The ones I ordered seemed more melted than what I had expected. It may have been because it was a super hot day. There workers were friendly and everyone loved seeing my dog! He was super well behaved and patiently waited for his own cup of custard! I bought him a plain vanilla kids small cup... but you can save a few bucks because they have FREE doggie sized ones! I had no idea and had already ordered and paid, then another worker stuck his head out and asked me if I wanted to give my dog his own cup. I said I already bought one and he said next time, just ask for a doggie one, it's free. My dog being 96lbs could probably have easily finished his small cup along with a doggie cup lol. It was pretty packed when we went, but it moved fast still. They have so many windows open and you get your sweet treat pretty quickly. Like I said, there really isn't any seating, but most people enjoy their treats on the spot at their cars. It's like a ice cream tailgating party!\n\nIf I am ever in the area again, I would come by here for a dessert stop! If you are traveling with your dog, take them here!! They welcome you and your pup! Not the cheapest, but prices are also pretty decent.",

This is a store in a neighborhood of established homes and mature trees, so young trees are not in high demand and there are not good conditions for young trees unless they are replacement trees. So if you're looking for trees or shrubs, this place has a lot of them. \n\nThe prices seem to be better here on some things than on others. The fertilizer was very expensive, but the mulch was cheaper. The sprinkler selection was especially better and cheaper than most other Lowe's, but then again, Broad Ripple and Meridian Kessler have established lawns and many of them have sprinkler systems, so it may be lack of demand. Service here is good and prompt. \n\nThey also have a pretty good selection of products made here in the USA! That is definitely one thing I have not given Lowe's props for is their sheer number of American made goods from mom and pop manufacturers. I try my best to choose those products if I have a choice.",

We brought our mountain bikes to ride at a trail in Goleta, so the staff were kind enough to lock it in the back garage for us when we weren't using it. The check in and check out process was easy. I really enjoyed the 24-access to coffee and tea. The warm and freshly baked cookies were yummy too!\n\nLOCATION:\nThis inn is one block from the marina, so it is located in a very walkable community. The problem we experienced is our room was located next to the main street, so it was loud. I heard people partying on the street and trucks driving by, so my quality of sleep was very poor, which was unfortunate because we wanted to relax and get away during our visit in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe worst part of our trip in this room was when the fire smoke detector randomly turned on around 9:30pm! It blasted our ears and we didn't know what was going on. I was so nervous and thought there was a fire in the building, so I asked my husband to go downstairs to find out what was going on. The evening staff person entered our room and couldn't figure out why the smoke detector turned on. She was finally able to disconnect the battery from the smoke detector, which silenced it! She contacted the manager who informed her that the Inn got new smoke detectors, which sound a really loud alarm when the batteries need to be replaced. This occurrence was nerve wrecking and an extreme annoyance.\n\nQUALITY OF FOOD:\nThe made to order breakfast was special. I've never stayed in an inn that provided made to order breakfast, so I really enjoyed this part of our stay. On our first morning, we asked for breakfast in bed and the staff delivered it right on time. The second morning, we decided to sit in the dining area, which was also nice.\n\nI probably will not revisit this Inn simply because the room was a major annoyance for me.",

  "text": "Not that great. Watery ice cream\n\nYou know, I wasn't a fan. Everyone loves this stuff, but to me - being from Kansas City, where we have Culvers, Freddy's, and Sheridans - the richness was nonexistent. Quite the contrary, it was as though someone super blended my concrete, then added milk. You ever had ice cream that melts a little too much, and the sugars mellow, and the cold warms, and it's just kind of, meh? Yep. You've had a $5 Ted's creation. \n\nI even sent the first one back, tried a second one - the s'mores - and...no change. I guess it's a St. Louie thing - but in my opinion, you's guys don't know what good is. Come to KC, and try Sheridan's, or Freddy's. It's like injecting your pleasure centers with freezing cold, fluffed sugar-butter covered in a thick layer of broadening perspective. \n\nIf you try something else, you could never do Ted's again. Sorry I had it, and sorry to put you onto Sheridan's - I've ruined custard forever. \n\nYou're welcome.",

  "text": "Came to Rusty Pelican for their Easter brunch after hearing really good things about it. Initially this place was one of the options for my birthday brunch, so it was already on my short list of places to eat brunch. \n\nThe restaurant is located right on the water and has a spectacular view, one of the best in all of Tampa Bay (or at least from the restaurants I've been to so far). \n\nThe buffet was plentiful. There was a wide variety of seafood, a carving station, breakfast foods and tons of dessert. The carrot cake was excellent, as was the apple cobbler. \n\nThe service was pretty good. I was impressed when I asked if the guy making omelets could make me an egg white omelet and he told me they weren't doing that for Easter but that he would make one for me anyway. He came and brought it directly to my table, and it was great! I guess the restaurant does different brunch options on non-holiday weeks. \n\nThis restaurant has an old, cozy feel to it that was really nice and warm. I will definitely come back to try brunch on a regular week and really enjoyed my experience here. Brunch with a view is always an A+ for me.",

  "text": "I visited Nada over the weekend and was definitely impressed. When we arrived, at around 8:30 Saturday night, there was a 25 minute wait. The hostess took our phone number, and when a table was ready, we received a text bidding us to return to the restaurant. This was a pretty cool service, as it allowed us to wander down the street to a game store instead of waiting uncomfortably in the entryway.\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous; The lighting is dim, but the dining room is filled with cool nooks where customers are seated around mismatched tables. One wall is filled with circular ends of colored glass bottles; the other side of the wall is located in the ladies room, where the tops of those bottles just poke through. So cool. The ladies room is also amazing, BTW; each stall has a different amazing wallpaper with crystal light fixture.\n\nFood was great. I ordered fried avocado tacos that were 'oh-my-god' delicious and nada fries, which are not fries at all, rather, crispy baked potato bits covered in sweet chili sauce and crema. I also got a blueberry lemonade, which was reeeeeally good, but not very generously portioned. \n\nNada is definitely NOT like my favorite taco truck at all, but it's a fun place to go for a night out. Their interpretations of street tacos are novel, and overall, I had an excellent experience.",

  "text": "Indian restaurants are somewhat scarce in the Indy-north 'burbs and Amber is the only one I know of in Carmel proper.\n\nLocated in a small strip center at the northwest corner of Carmel Drive and Meridian Street, this unassuming Indian eatery combines efficient service with decent fare.....if a bit pricey. Then again, given the price of gas lately, a short drive to Amber more and more frequently trumps the longer drive to some of our more wallet-friendly Indian haunts in the city.\n\nThe food does not disappoint and personal faves include the Nav Ratan Korma - a vegetable curry that is creamy and deeply satisfying - think Indian comfort food! Lamb Vindaloo is usually what my better half chooses here - so spicy he needs a refreshing Mango Lassi (yogurt and Mango puree -based drink) to vanquish the flames!\nOne thing not to be missed, in my humble opinion, is the Kashmiri Naan bread. It's a bit sweet thanks to its nut, shredded coconut and dried cherry stuffing and boy does it ever pair well with the savory side of the menu!  Also, be sure to try the Gulab Jamun (mini fried dough balls in cardamon-infused honey syrup) or Kheer (Indian rice pudding - I often get extra for breakfast the next day..LOL) for dessert.\n\nAmber is open seven days per week and offers a lunch buffet from 11:00-2:30 pm. Catering is also offered, though I've not tried that yet.",

  "text": "Oh, the guilt. \n\nTHE GUILT. \n\nHow the heck did I literally inhale that veggie burger and truffle tots as \"efficiently\" as I did? Seriously. The shocked look on my friend's face clearly showed that I most certainly chowed on the \"Taco Truck\" version of a burger waaaaay quicker than what could be classified as humanly possible. And, although some may roll their eyes at the $11.50 price tag for a burger and a side (plus $2 upgrade for the \"truffle\" tots) but I can attest that this was one of the best veggie burgers (and tots) that I have had in quite some time. \n\nI appreciate that you have the option to choose a bun preference that included Brioche, Pretzel, Gluten-Free, and Wheat and that vegans like myself can opt for the House-made veggie patty and still enjoy any of the 12 styles that they have available ranging from the \"Tennessee\" or \"Jalapeno Popper\" to the \"Hawaiian\" and \"Shroomin\" with just minor tweaks. The burger was nothing short of hearty and full of robust flavor. This hungry lady was happy and stuffed!\n\nMy only issue came with the 2 glasses of wine ($9) that I ordered. My first glass tasted a bit \"off\" and had some discoloration that hinted that this vintage may have been sitting out uncorked for wee bit too long but when the bubbly waitress came back around to see if we were still feeling dehydrated, I went ahead and ordered a second glass to keep up with my appetite. I should have refrained as the second glass definitely hit all signs that the quality of the wine was an issue. Perhaps, it was my newfound sluggish state (due to the heavy load that I just ate) or the swell spirits that we were in but we didn't send the glass back. So my glass just sat there untouched. \n\nFor my next visit, I'll try one of the brews instead as they have quite the extensive craft beer list here. \n\nOverall, this is a nice addition to the Gulch neighborhood and the food is solid. Just be sure to bring your appetite and Sommeliers beware!",

I'll remember noon for next time!   \n\nInitial smiles from the girl behind the counter who had such a bubbly personality, made me like this place already! \nSecond thing, sooooo many flavors!!  I asked her some popular ones and her faves and she directed me to the chocolate freezer.   Yep!  They have one freezer dedicated to chocolate flavors!\n\nAfter a few samples I settled on getting the mini scoop sampler.  4 mini scoops for $5.\nMexican Hot Chocolate\nKing Cake\nCoffee Pecan Brittle\nSalted Caramel\n\nI didn't sample the King Cake prior to getting it but from what the girl described, and being a signature NOLA dessert, I got it.  I think I would enjoy a regular cake version of this more than this ice cream adaption, but it was interesting none the less, and had the flavors she described.\n\nThe other flavors I got were equally delicious, but the winner of this sampler is the Mexican Hot Chocolate.  Dark and creamy with a spicy note that lingers. Next time I'm here, I would definitely come back for another scoop of this and to try others on their list!  \n\n\n(NOLA trip: 2/2015)",

We had to wait a little while for our order which I understood when I saw them bring out a large catering order to another car. The waitress was friendly and made sure we had everything we ordered. I got the Asiago chicken pasta and my daughter got a chicken kids meal. The Asiago chicken was really rich it was hard to eat much of it in one sitting. The sauce was really thick. The breadsticks didn't taste as fresh and buttery as I love about Olive Garden but they were decent. I had ordered some extras. It's not a bad place to stop by for lunch. I would probably do it during the week though when they have lunch size options.",

The main entrance is through the left set of doors.  While it make look dark from the outside, don't worry, it's just the tint on the windows.\n\nUpon entering, there is no hostess stand so it's a little confusing.  The waitress saw me immediately and was able to assist.  Right when you walk in, there is a large open room filled with tables and booths with a busser stand on the back wall.  To the right of the main entrance is a second room with a bar, high top tables, and some TVs.  If you don't see a waitress, just walk to the bar since there was a bartender available.\n\nI placed a to-go order and it was ready within 10 minutes from my call.  My order of Bun Thit Nuong (vermicelli noodles with grilled beef, 2 shrimp, 1 large egg roll, fresh veggies, peanuts, and fish sauce) was a large portion.  The meat was not tough, the shrimp were cooked perfectly, and the egg roll was only slightly soggy after the car ride back to the office.  I would absolutely order again, but I've got my eye on the pho next, or banh mi next.\n\nOverall, food is good, service was good, décor inside and out is lacking.

  "text": "As far as Thai food goes, I admit that I am a bit picky, bc I grew up eating some pretty fabulous Thai food. So as far as Thai Cuisine & Cafe, It was OK, but nothing to write home about. I tried the tom yom soup and the padthai with veggies. The tom yom seemed like the kind of soup you can buy at the store in a can....except they added chicken. I was pretty disappointed in the soup overall- it lacked the lemongrass flavor and spiciness and was pretty watery. My entree earned them a little redemption, but overall the tofu was shriveled and overcooked, and the noodles lacked the full flavor I am accustomed to tasting with pad thai. A bite of green curry from my friend seemed especially salty as well. \n\nAs for the pros- they have clearly established a nice place, and the cozy decor was cute. We came with a party of 13, so it was nice of them to accommodate us in their small restaurant. The owner seemed pretty nice and eager to please. Parking is not an issue, there is a lot in the back so that is a pro.\n\n I dont know how recently they opened, but they have a few kinks to work out.

I can honestly tell you that UB has not been remodeled or redecorated since I moved to STL in 1979 and that is part of its charm and ambiance. To be honest, it had been at least 8 years since my last visit to UB's and when I walked in for my recent breakfast it was as if things had never changed. That was because they hadn't.\n\nWe were quickly seated, which surprised me since it was a Sunday and around 9:00AM. I guess everyone was either at church or sleeping in. The restaurant was still very full and the tables are cramped very close together. Keeping the closeness in mind, you may want to keep that in mind when picking your subject of conversation. The lady next to us was telling her friend about her son in prison. I had to bite my tongue, I so bad wanted to ask her if her son had a bitch or if he was one of the other inmates bitch. \n\nOur waitress was very attentive, made sure we quickly had our morning coffee. She also had a good sense of humor, she chuckled when I asked if there were any off the menu specials. Since they had no specials we went with the Country Fried Steak and the 2 Pork Chop Breakfast. Both came with two eggs and hash browns on the side. In addition to these hearty breakfasts, we shared an order of biscuits and gravy. \n\nThe Country Fried Steak was very good, a nice big piece of tender beef breaded and covered in flavorful milk gravy. The pork chops were not as good, they were a thin cut and overly cooked making them dry and tough. I was hoping for a thick, juicy chop. Our eggs were  cooked over easy and done well, as were the hash browns. They're not your traditional hash browns, but are more an American Fries.\n\nThe star of the breakfast was the hearty serving of biscuits and gravy. We got two huge flaky biscuits covered in milk gravy filled with pieces of sausage. Next time I need a comfort breakfast, I may just come here and order Biscuits & Gravy with a side of hash browns.",

As it was on the short list for a friend of mine before a concert, and I love trying new places to Yelp about, I voted Mason's.  At dinnertime on a Thursday, the bar area was absolutely packed and loud and seating was impossible, so the actual restaurant space was our choice for dining.  The concept behind Mason's is classic Southern cuisine with a French twist.  Sounds fantastic.  The deviled eggs with bacon jam (I feel anything with bacon jam automatically wins) and pickled okra were so effing delicious and the perfect little appetizer to split before dinner.  My friend got the shrimp and grits and let me tell you, come hungry if you order this.  There was no way she was finishing that even if I helped her.  Their burger, with garlic aioli over mayo, was perfectly done and not too gigantic.  Also it came with arugula over traditional lettuce.  Overall a great combo that didn't need much adornment.  Mind you, the prices here are a little steep, but you can always go the tapas route and split some appetizers.  They have a huge wine selections and a lot of local brews on tap.  The space is dark, intimate, and quiet.  The service was great.  Overall a good experience and I will be back.",

  "text": "Hey y'all lets get crazy!  I was here yesterday as a first timer because i had a sushi addicted friend from hoboken visiting me.  \n\nit's always hard to bring an out of town visitor into a space you've never yourself been - we walked into a super clean, trendy looking, mod space and I immediately got nervous - the place was like empty! But it was a Sunday on a holiday weekend so it makes sense considering center city as a whole was pretty quiet. my nerves were calmed as soon as the food came out - and i was quickly impressed with my first bite!\n\nfirst off - the yelp check in gets you free edamamme.  hello! what a great deal.  the edamamme was fresh and salty and cooked perfectly.  great way to start off a great lunch. \n\nthe staff was very fast and very helpful always refilling our drinks and bringing the food out fast. \n\nthe presentation was GREAT. my rolls came out with a lil umbrella and my friends rolls came out on a platter with a very cute decorative sauce.  we were both HIGHLY IMPRESSED. \n\nthe veg roll choices were overwhelming. \n\nobviously, as a vegan, i didnt have any of the fish rolls - but my friend said they tasted fresh and she enjoyed it a lot. \n\noverall i would say this is a five star place.  we didnt order any of the specials or utilize any of the combos available but i would say the menu offers a full range from very affordable to very opulent.",

The table wasn't ready yet so we sat outside on their small bench and the server who greeted us brought us some water.\n\nFinally at our seat we perused the menu and settled on the heirloom tomato salad (feta on the side) and the bloody beet steak (yogurt on the side)  Both dishes were as excellent to taste as they were to look at. If there is something they know here, it's wow factor with food.  They have great presentation.  The beets were perfectly cooked and I love the play on meat even though it didn't contain any.  Each dish stood on its own and was rich but not overpowering.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the short ribs.  I expected tender short ribs but I was blown away by the sauce and the sides.  This dish was a symphony of flavor and even though I don't eat much meat these days, this dish was easily up there with some of the best I've had.\n\nService was excellent and they kept both our water and our beer glasses full (we split a bottle of Pumking)  This restaurant was an excellent way to begin my labor day weekend and my plan now is to come back for the squid ink pasta.\n\nF & F, you've got a new fan.",

All three were absolutely wonderful experiences that expanded our horizons of New Orleans and the surrounding areas. We learned so much and had such a delightful time with every host.\n\nSome things to note:\nIn the cold weather months you probably won't see many if any alligators on the swamp tours because they are bruminating (new word I learned that's sort of gator deep winter sleepy time).\nDepending on where you get on the tour mini bus, you may or may not get a seat near the front or the back. If you are someone very picky about where you sit on the bus try to find out what the first stop is and get yourself to that first stop to get on and get your favorite seat.\nWhen you're headed back at the end of your tours, frequently drivers will be kind enough to drop you along their designated route. So if you're on the way, you may get an extra special drop off as long as it doesn't inconvenience other passengers.\n\nRemind her that there are no bathrooms on any of the buses so be sure to always use the facilities before you get on and off!\n\nTL/dr: Best tours in/around New Orleans, hands down!",

  "text": "I recently attended one of the chef's dinners at Amerigo. They sell tickets to these dinners and have them once a month in Nashville. They also do the dinners at the Cool Springs location, on back to back dates. We were greeted & escorted back to at large room in the back of the restaurant. In that room was a HUGE table with people seated. There were 26 people on each side of the table. \n\nThey had a large team of servers who brought out the different courses & drink pairings. The menu changes each month obviously & chef Steven Robilio told us that he tries to source local things for whenever they are in season. This February dinner was a little hard to get local produce, but the meat we had was local. \n\nEach course was explained & brought out. The timing was pretty good. We had 5 courses along with 5 drink pairings & it was about a two hour affair. I did notice that a lot of the people who attend the chef dinners were repeat customers. I also noticed that a lot of the clientele were seniors.\n\nMy favorites of the dinner were the pork lion & the meat balls in the Italian wedding soup. The pork lion was sous-vided & so tender. The meatballs were seasoned will & delicious. One thing that I did notice about the dinner was it was heavier than other course meals I've had in recent times. Maybe the clientele likes to feel like they're getting their monies worth, & they are. We left stuffed. \n\nOne of the drawbacks about the intimacy of the table was it was almost hard to eat the food as the chairs literally touched each other. I kept finding myself trying to to elbow the gentlemen seated next to me. I think it would be much better if they either sat people at the ends of the tables or maybe used the table located on the elevated section of the room too. \n\nFor the $50 price tag (plus 30% gratuity) I think it was a bargain in the Nashville food scene. I've been to course meals with pairings that end up over the 100 dollar mark easily per person.",

The creamed spinach was good, not grand, the Greenburg potato skins were pure fried potato skins, no potato at all and served with a sour cream and horseradish sauce. Do it at home and save the big bucks. \n\nMy big dilemma is we have more open table certificates that we would have loved to have used and we have no problem mentioning yelp, but they do, so I'm trying to even reason why I would want to return at this point Douglas? I hope you enjoyed your unwarranted $50.00 tip... Oh and I do hope that you read my little note on the receipt. The staff used to be welcoming, accommodating and friendly, seems to have gotten a bit snobbish, but I can take my $50.00 tips elsewhere and get a filet cooked properly without the sideshow. The service used to be stellar, but those days are gone.  \n\nIt's now a great place for older worn out men trying to pick up very used \"ladies\" or so it seemed, the blend of tables from floor to floor and the acoustics left conversations flow though out the restaurant, this is what made my night, have your piano player come in earlier. \n\nBTW, I made a dry aged standing rib roast for Christmas and hubby said it put yours to shame, I can also teach you how to cook a proper steak.",

It's not too much more expensive than a normal scoop! \nThey also cater (we used them for several events when I went to Tulane) and have even been known to create a new flavor for an event.",

I went to dinner here with several friends and we decided to each order different items and share, which I'm always a fan of because you get the chance to try more! \n\nI started my meal with the Spaghetti Western cocktail, which is a rosemary and Campari spin on a Bulleit bourbon Old Fashioned. Living in Louisville I know the Old Fashioned, and this twist on one was delicious! \n\nOur group then shared the Cheese Plate, Marinated Olives, Smoked Tomato Bruschetta, Italian Baked Mac & Cheese, Two Run Farms Lamb Sliders, Bacon-Wrapped Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates, and some delicious crab dish that I cannot recall the name of. Everything was amazing! The only thing I didn't try was the dates, because I'm not a fan of bleu cheese, but I had some of everything else and I would definitely gladly order any of these dishes again. My favorites were the olives, the mac & cheese, and the crab dish. \n\nThe atmosphere was also great. They had live jazz and the service was awesome. \n\nIf you're looking for a spot to have dinner in this area I highly recommend Three Muses! Just make sure to make a reservation, because it's small and it's a popular spot (so much so that there's a time limit for dining, but not to worry it's more than enough time, they just want to make sure people don't linger here all night and not give others a chance to experience this awesome spot).",

So, when my boyfriend came to town this weekend, I wanted to take him somewhere amazing!\n\nHaving visited Thailand this past summer, my standards are pretty high now whenever I'm on the hunt for good Thai food. This place honestly hits the nail on the head. First of all, I love the decor inside--it's super peaceful and cozy, and very intimate, without being stuffy.\n\nMost importantly, the food is amazing. We started off with the Veggie Spring Rolls, which were awesome. I hate it when spring rolls get too mushy. These had the perfect amount of crunch! For the main course, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai (always a crowd favorite) and my other half got the Drunken Noodles. By far the best Thai I've had on the Main Line. The presentation was beautiful. \n\nOur waiter was also marvelous. He removed our appetizer right as we were finishing up and brought our entrées out immediately after. He was very attentive and even cracked a few jokes with us. I wish I could remember his name; we gave him a great tip. \n\nSiamese Princess helped me have a truly warm and happy reunion with my boyfriend. I will definitely be back!

Our tour guide here was obviously new and very nervous and not so great. I remember two stories that stood out the most when I visited 15 years ago: How they use a pineapple to signify when guests have overstayed their welcome and the whistle walk from the outside kitchens to the inside dining rooms. Well, this guide didn't even know about the whistle walk story.\n\nLaura was FABULOUS. Our guide here was Bryan Dupree and he was a wealth of information and had a great sense of humor as well. We all really got a sense of what it was like living here in the past and what it was like for the slaves and owners.\n\nEven though the Oak Alley guide failed, the overall experience was well worth it and I'd recommend it to anyone visiting New Orleans for anything beyond the drinking scene. There is another company that does the same tour for about $5 less, but when we were there, they were out of commission. Just letting you know there are options. Chat with your concierge.",

There's at least one cashier working at any time, but sometimes 2 during busier times, a security guard is almost always present, some pharmacy staff in the back, and they have \"doc-in-a-box\" service available for those requiring quick, non-emergency care. 3 stars\n\nFacilities: A typical brick-and-mortar, flattop building you'd expect from this chain. There is ample private lot parking, and a drive through for the pharmacy. The major issue I've noted with the outside is the trashcan is not emptied often enough. Other than that, the exterior is quite nice. The inside is aisled, with the medical services in the rear. There is nothing really remarkable to say about the interior. It's usually tidy, though. 3 stars\n\nOverall: This is a regular stop for me when I require a pharmacy. There is a Walgreen's across the street that's typically filled with all sorts of riffraff I try to avoid if I can. If you're in this area, go here instead. 3 stars",

Any gains I make in fitness this summer are going to be completely offset by water ice and ice cream. \n\nI am the first to admit that water ice isn't totally my thing. I'm not from here and it just never appealed to me much, I didn't get the hype. Italiano's water ice, though, this is on another level (I haven't tried Pop's but I hear that place in on-par). Way better than John's!\n\nThere was quite a line on a Sunday evening around 6 but it moved quickly. Even with a relatively limited selection of flavours it took me forever to decide. I was jonesin' for a cone so I went with the strawberry ice cream and it was absolutely killer. However, when I sampled from of my friend's gelati with coffee ice cream and chocolate water ice, I was sold. Totally getting a gelati next time I come. I'm thinking black cherry water ice with vanilla ice cream.",

Now, I've been a fan of Publix for as far back as I can remember, but this one has a bit of special flare that makes me love the brand even more. It isn't that they have anything in particularly different but jus the way the store is laid out. It appears to be a bit smaller than most stores and each visit is easy to navigate the store and finish a shopping trip in less time. \n\nI also appreciate the number of checkout lines. There are maybe 3-4 less than other larger Publix stores, but I've never had to wait in line for too long upon each visit/checkout. The staff here is so friendly and I love seeing the management at the front every time. \n\nLastly, the parking situation here is brilliant. Since it is a shared parking lot with the SunTrust and other businesses there is tons of available parking. It's so easy to enter and exit, let alone find a great space. \n\nLove this Publix, as I do many of their stores.",

Granted, the place has lost a little bit of its luster over the past 7 or 8 years, but its still okay.  \n\nFirst draw, the outdoor seating and general ambiance of the place - you get that eating in a courtyard feeling, which is awesome.  I usually eat lunch here when I'm in the area, so I haven't eaten inside yet. \n\nLike I said, the place has degraded since I first came; not sure if it's because of a change in management or recipe or if my tastebuds just got more mature...well, not really that, just that the menu has changed.  They used to serve this really awesome salad that they sadly, no longer even remember was there.  But I'm usually satisfied with the empanadas and a salad.  They have soup and salad combos too, but I never order those.  \n\nService is generally good - the place is rarely too busy and overcrowded.  Price - normal, you can get a decent meal for under $20 for lunch.  \n\nParking - This is downtown SB, so you're probably already parked in a parking lot nearby.",

  "text": "If you're looking for affordable, yet quality sushi, one of my favorite spots to recommend would have to be Crazy Sushi in the Rittenhouse area. An added bonus? It's BYO! \n\nIt's a slim, sleek space with comfortable seating and a sushi bar at the end. \n\nSalad\n \nSalad was fairly standard with fresh Romaine. The ginger dressing was clearly freshly made. \n\nVampire Bowl [$9]\nSpicy tuna tartare, avocado bowl\n  \nA must order in my mind is the Vampire Bowl, their unique take on tuna tartare. I loved the contrast in textures with the crunch from the tempura and the creaminess of the avocado bowl. The sweet wasabi mayo was balanced by the light heat from the spicy tuna. \n\nVegetable Tempura [$5]\n\nThe GF's a sucker for veggie tempura and this didn't disappoint. A thin layer of tempura coated mushrooms, sweet potato, and carrots. It came accompanied with a light tempura dipping sauce. \n\nBeef Negimaki [$6]\nScallion, thin-sliced beef, teriyaki\n  \nOn this trip, the negimaki was a bit disappointing. The beef could have been more thinly sliced and better seasoned, though I appreciated the bite of the scallion amidst the teriyaki glaze. \n\nTriple Sushi [$25]\nTuna, salmon, yellowtail, tuna roll\n\nThe triple sushi featured some of our favorite nigiri rolls, including salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. All very clean-tasting and fresh, the platter also came with a tuna roll. I appreciated that the tuna was whole and not minced within the sushi. \n\nUni Sushi [$8]\n\nI was also in the mood for uni so asked for an order of uni sushi. Then again, when am I *not* in the mood for uni? Sourced from California, these were creamy, light, and buttery. \n\nBloomingdale Roll [$13]\nSpicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy kani, spicy yellowtail, spicy shrimp, avocado, longan\n  \nI was also intrigued by their Bloomingdale specialty roll. The pink seaweed seemed a bit more delicate in texture and taste, supporting the sweetness of the lychee. This contrasted with the subtly spicy mixture of tuna, salmon, crab yellowtail, and shrimp (whoa!). Due to the laundry list of items, the flavors were a bit muddled, but definitely veers toward the sweeter side of a sushi roll. Interesting! \n\nSweet Potato Roll [$5]\n\nOf course, we also had to try our standard sweet potato roll. Crazy Sushi has one of the best iterations, with a wonderful juxtaposition of creaminess from the sweet potato and a light crunch on the exterior. The black sesame seeds studding the surrounding rice made for a perfect bite. \n\nSo if you're not looking to go omakase and want a relaxed sushi meal, I'd recommend checking out Crazy Sushi. Whether you're looking for Americanized rolls or nigiri done right, they've got you covered.",

  "text": "I just had a couple of pizzas delivered tonight. It's Mothers Day, my hubby is working, I didn't want to cook, and wasn't in the mood to go out... Anyway, this definitely hit the spot and I came up with the ultimate veggie lovers pizza to order from Pizza Factory. They don't have much for veggie lovers in their specialty pizza selections, but this should definitely be added, in my not-so-humble opinion.  ;)  \n\nI ordered a medium gluten free cheese pizza and then added: mushrooms, spinach, red onions, artichokes, and tomatoes (I got them cooked, but you can have them added after it is baked, too). It was a beautiful marriage between all of the veggies and their amazing sauce. Their sauce has a delicious fresh tomato taste. By the way, their gluten free crust is probably the second best out there that I have tasted so far (and it's quite a bit less expensive than my number one choice plus a bit thicker and therefore more filling). \n\nI also love the fact that their gluten free pizza comes in a medium size. It's the only size (most restaurants only offer gluten free in one size), but many only offer them in small. This is much better for us. \n\nMy son prefers Meat Lovers types of pizzas; the more meat... the better. I ordered him a Wolfpack. It contains: mozzarella cheese, ham, Canadian bacon, sausage, pepperoni, salami, and bacon. He was one happy guy!\n\nI was also happy to get a special price on the Wolfpack pizza tonight. When I called, I asked if there were any specials and they happened to have one that included this in a medium size. \n\nWe actually ended up paying a bit less tonight for these two medium specialty types of pizzas than the last time I had Dominoes delivered and ordered a medium plus 2 small gluten free pizzas (two of them were 3-toppings each and one gluten free was a specialty). Both times we had leftovers, but we actually have quite a bit more leftovers this time, with a more generous amount of toppings, and higher quality. I honestly thought I was saving money at Dominoes. Nope! (In case you don't know... Once you start adding in gluten free pizzas, the coupons don't apply, they are more expensive for the same size pizza, and the crust is always a thin crust that may or may not taste very good.)\n\nEvery time we go to this particular Pizza Factory, it just seems to get better and better. This was the first time having them deliver, though, and it went smoothly, too. \n\nWe are actually planning on meeting many friends there again later this coming week and no... I'm not getting tired of it. I believe that they are much better than most (if not all) of the similar types of pizza places locally. This is especially true out of all of the ones who deliver AND have gluten free.",

My first concrete (basically a blizzard, but with better chunks and handed to you upside down to demonstrate its concrete-ity) had real peach slices swirled through the vanilla custard and is tied for my favorite concrete with the TeDad's--local St. Louis oatmeal cookies are mixed into that tasty treat.\n\nI love that the place runs like a well-oiled machine by teenagers working towards a Ted Drewes-sponsored college scholarship and that you can buy cartons of the stuff for your own enjoyment--we even had some at our rehearsal dinner!  Even better, they'll pack a pile of frozen custard with dry ice so it survives the trip from STL to Chicago.\n\nYeah, I know STLians are sort of fanatical about Ted Drewes (but that's sort of normal from what I can tell, because they're basically fanatical about anything STL in general), but this is not unfounded loyalty and love.  I used to say that a trip to STL was wasted unless we visited my frozen custard heaven... now my love/hate relationship with lactose limits the visits I can handle.  Even with the belly aches, though, every trip to Ted Drewes is so worth it.\n\n*Edit* 2/5/08\n\nHow dare you, Ted Drewes.  I move to St. Louis in the dour month of January and you're CLOSED?  WHAT???  And now it's February and you're STILL CLOSED?  Geez, if I'd known better, I woulda stayed in Chicago til Spring!  Bah.",

  "text": "If you have a large group of friends that want to do this, its a great time, the only downside is that it is pricey and you still must provide your own alcohol. My only recommendation for the owners would be to offer a \"reserve a seat\" option, not just a \"reserve the whole bike\" option. I would personally love to do this more often during the summer, but struggle to get my friends to do it with me. You can only have cans and plastic bottles on the bike...which isn't a problem if you stop by Sun King for some fresh cans on your way to your bike appointment. \n\nI went for a ride on the HandleBar late in October as a team building exercise with some of my colleagues. The driver was great and even suggested several common stops/routes so that we could get off and go into bars to have a group drink/shot. \n\nMy team at work commonly discusses our experience, and we often talk about doing it again in the spring. \n\nAbout 2 weeks before Christmas I got a Christmas card in the mail from one of the owners. Handwritten, custom HandleBar Christmas Card thanking me for using them and wishing me happy holidays. That kind of customer service goes far in my book.",

This location is fairly new, thus some wrinkles need to be ironed out. \n\nFirst of all, I was impressed with the ample parking considering this area tends to give me anxiety. Metered lot and short walk to the main entrance. \n\nHostesses were friendly and welcoming. Wait time was 35-45 min on a weekday afternoon during a holiday week. Inside seemed crowded so we requested outdoors. Our first table was melting us, so they kindly moved us to a table in the shade.\n\nThe patio deck faces sunset so be prepared to sunbathe. The ground below offers more space between tables plus umbrellas. Water views and gulf breezes made it more relaxing. Would recommend they \"bird proof\" the area. Birds squawking, swarming tables and stealing food wasn't the Doc Ford's vibe I took from the island. \n\nOur server was such a pleasant person but may have been too busy for us. Everything was slow to arrive, and visits were too few and far between.\n\nOur food was absolutely delish! Yucatán shrimp was just as heavenly as remembered. Gluten free flatbread pizza was divine!! Some portions were slightly smaller than Sanibel but no one left hungry.",

Yes you're a fancy classy restaurant with perfectly cooked prime rib but that doesn't mean the presentation and quality of something simple as a salad can be ehhh. I would recommend for having such simple and few choices of appetizers, they should still be presented at their prime.",

I honestly think the food was 2-star, but the cool decor, atmosphere and the creativity bump this place up another.\n\nAs others have mentioned, I came in knowing that the noodles at this place would not be authentic. That's fine by me, as long as Cheu's interpretation was tasty. However, I was disappointed, even with my bar low. \n\nThe Pork Belly Buns- were good, but a bit on the greasy side because they pan-fried the buns itself. Then you top the pork belly, and you get a the heaviest single bite you can get. Pork belly was good, but I've had better, at many places. I felt like the pork belly itself was lacking something. I added their house spicy sauce (on the table) to cut through some of the greasiness.\n\nThe Pork Belly Ramen (I love pork belly, can you tell?) broth was lacking depth. The noodles were a bit hard and gritty. The sea beans were CRAZY salty. The pork belly was the same as those in the buns- good, but nothing I haven't had before.\n\nIf I were to come back, I would try the other dishes because I do feel the menu items are inventive. However, I would be reluctant to go back anytime soon.",

We beat the dinner crowd and are officially becoming old people. First impressions? Awesome decor. Nada is a Cincinnati transplant connected to Circle Centre mall downtown Indianapolis. It's inside boasts an explosion of cheerful color and intentional details. A little too replicated for my taste, but definitely bright and funky. The fun doesn't end there as their menu displays an exciting variety of Tex-Mex fusion options.\n\nHusband and I started with the Guacamole. Of course. Solid, but a little bland. Their chips have a unique flavor, as well. More like chunky crisps than chips. I moved on to the Braised Chicken Enchiladas with a side of Sweet Chili Glazed Nada Fries (really just soft chunks of cooked potatoes). Pretty good stuff here, but I couldn't resist sampling Husband's Truffled Mashed Potatoes (although I did manage to avoid his Pork Belly Tacos, so success was had). I should have stopped there, but I knew it would be a while till we went out to eat again, so I stuffed my already full belly with some Warm Chocolate Torte. SO GOOD!!\n\nAll in all, Nada brought a strong showing. Attentive service, fun flavors, cool modern vibe, and slick downtown presence. And here's where I break it down to the nitty-gritty. You have to really present to impress me with your Mexican fare and I must say that the authentic offerings of nearby Adobo Grill have this place beat with a little more warmth and charm. Nada is still great, but the competition is pretty fierce. Is there room in downtown Indianapolis for multiple upscale Mexican dining rooms? I guess we'll find out.",

Supposedly they have drumsticks as well, but I didn't see any actual evidence of this, nor would drumsticks be cost-effective due to the bones. \n\nAt just under $9 per pound, 7 pieces of mixed dark and white meat ended up costing about $7, plus 50 cents per sauce. We tried the green goddess ranch and chipotle lime sauces, but I wasn't really blown away by either. The chipotle was heavy on smokey flavor, but I couldn't detect much lime. The ranch was all right, but I've had better. The chicken itself was good though. The white meat wasn't dry, so I actually slightly preferred it over the dark meat, which could be a little fatty and a tiny bit tough at times (and I usually prefer dark meat). The original pretzel breading is nicely seasoned and crispy, with a nice texture. Their special flavor (Thai coconut basil something) was pretty good as well. \n\nIt's nice to not have to go all the way to Fednuts for decent fried chicken.",

It was divine!\n\nThe other thing I noticed was that people really want to share the love of Ted Drewes frozen custard.

  "text": "Typical brewpub atmosphere and menu. Loud music on the patio, loud tv's inside. Could use some better signage as it's difficult to see/find and there's no direct entrance off Racetrack.\n\nServer was great and recommended several beers and menu items (none of which we ordered and thinking we probably should have). Instead we ordered the pretzels, french onion soup, and greek salad. All were nothing special and I would not recommend any. Broth in onion soup had a very strong rosemary/thyme flavor that overpowered it. Pretzels and cheese were exactly like those served at Hofbrauhaus (disappointing) and beer cheese was a very small portion. Side note: server recommended wings, burgers, pizzas, and calzones - will try these if I revisit which I'm not in a hurry to do.",

  "text": "Cajun Encounters has excellent customer service. The staff responded to my emails within an hour of sending them and answered all of my questions each time. The company is also one of the few that are open for tours on Christmas Day. However, despite the \"local flavor\" of this group, be prepared for much of the same touristy feel complete with crying kids and exasperated parents. Tour groups are always kind of a crap shoot, I guess, and Cajun Encounters is no exception. \n\nI enjoyed the Swamp Tour a lot. Our guide had the perfect mix of wry humor, interesting facts and amusing stories. Furthermore, he was clearly passionate about what he did and loved his city, so he didn't sound like he was reciting a rehearsed script. The tour itself takes you through some beautiful passages within Honey Island Swamp. Those silver, hanging Spanish moss curtains you see in pictures? They're real. In person, they are so utterly beautiful that I would actually recommend you tour the swamps in the winter than in warmer seasons. You may not see as much wildlife (although we still managed to see (and handle) a baby alligator, 2 snakes, 4 turtles, 1 magnificent blue heron, a beaver-like creature, and a mama wild boar with her 2 piglets who swam out to our boat for 20 mins feasting on the marshmallows our guide threw), but there is no foliage to mar the beauty of all that silver.\n\nThe Plantation Tour was much less impressive. Not so much for the plantations or the guides, but rather that it was very poorly planned. We were given far too much time at Laura Plantation (about 3 hours) and far too little time at Oak Alley (about 1 hour total from disembarking to re-boarding). Personally, I was completely unimpressed with our guide at Laura (who for some reason pronounces \"archives\" with a hard \"ch\" like the herb), and do not understand why people rave about the tour here. I was ready to leave halfway through. Oak Alley on the other hand is just as majestic and beautiful in person as it is in all the postcards, and the tour guides are far more captivating. Every single person in our group was disappointed with the lack of time we had at Oak Alley.",

  "text": "Much like all of the Marathon locations, I liken this place to an upscale wanna-be hip version of Denny's with a liquor license.\n\nI go because it is convenient and relatively cheap.  They specialize in perfectly acceptable executions of perfectly ordinary food.  A few items (gingerbread pancakes, and the fries when they are not soggy) stand out as being very good.  However, every now and then they manage to completely eff up something simple like a salad.  There is often a silly wait for brunch, and I have repeatedly run into the issue of the hours and menu posted on the door being irrelevant to the actual hours or menu available.\n\nThe service is extremely hit or miss.  They often apply the chaos paradigm where four different people (say the hostess, water boy, waiter and bartender) are all involved in taking orders from and bringing stuff to your table, and the likelihood of everyone in your party actually getting all of the things you ordered at remotely the same time is slim to none.  They have a generally solid beer selection and execute their cocktails well.\n\nIf you go here with middling expectations, you will not be disappointed.  The meal experiences are always inherently better than at the actual Denny's - due, in no small part, to the aforementioned liquor license.",

  "text": "Describe this pizza in three words... Super Yummy Delicious!\n\nWell, that's what the menu says but I'm here to corroborate. \n\nFinally did the dance with Food + Drink tonight and it was fun and delicious. Ordering online is great, and with the specified pickup windows you get fast, friendly and damn near personalized service too! \n\nDue to Covid the dining room is closed. Hell. They aren't even letting guests set foot inside. Hallelujah! \n\nIt comes out fresh, hot and right to your car, so all you have to do is drive away! \n\nThe cherry picker pizza is the truth, and that's coming from a carnivore! Heirloom cherry tomatoes atop a fresh mozz and basil pie, sweet, savory, and punchy! \n\nBut finding good toppings isn't the hard part of making pizza. It's really iall about the dough, and owner Aaron Foster learned from the masters and keeps their methods alive! It takes him 2 or 3 days to make it, so when he says there's only 20 pies available tonight, he means it. Order early and order often!\n\nWe also tried a standard pepperoni. Thats a spicy pepperoni! In a good way of course, if you like it spicy, which I do. My kiddo thought it was too hot for him, so he gave them to me and I happily added them to my cherry picker.\n\nThis pizza requires a lot of time and effort to create, and Aaron is hands on from start to finish. As a result of all that handcrafted hard work, this Za' ain't cheap, but it's totally worth it. \n\nTo keep it in check you should know that a pie and a salad can safely serve at least 3 hungry adults, probably four, especially if you add some \"magic cookies\" or their housemade ice cream or margaritas!\n\nIf you haven't been, grab your phone and order NOW for tomorrow night!",

  "text": "After watching the popups, the name change and finally settling on a location, I made my way to Cheu Noodle Bar on a Friday evening with a buddy to see what it was all about.  What I found was a very cool, fun, fresh take on a noodle bar and I'll be returning.\n\nThe space here is a bit tight and most likely you'll have a wait on a Friday or Saturday evening.  We chose to wait it out at Varga (conveniently located down the street) while our table cleared out.  It didn't take terribly long before we were at our seats and ordering.\n\nI was very impressed with the black garlic wings.  Heat and sweet were the tastes that hit my mouth but I did feel the dish was put together nicely.  The wings were cooked perfectly and it wasn't too sauced.  It had just enough to leave a nice impression.  The dumplings (potato, egg, cheese, chili oil) were not my favorite due to the filling combo, but I would not be opposed to trying more of their dumplings (if they change).\n\nThe star for me was the lamb neck hand torn noodle dish.  The spice on the lamb was killer, and it was falling apart while I tried to eat it.  The mustard greens and dates brought those other flavor punches that made this dish truly excellent.  I would come back and eat here just for this.\n\nThe spot is fun, the music is great (I heard mostly A Tribe Called Quest) and the kitchen worked really well together in the space they have.  I think these guys are doing a great job and I hope they will be in Philly for a while.",

The walls are whiteboards -- convenient for noting the changing daily specials.  \n\nHere since time begin (or so it seems), there's nothing high-brow on the menu. It's classic diner food with a St. Louis twist.  I ordered breakfast and asked for the St. Louis version -- with chili.  Expecting only a small drizzling of chili, what I received was enough for a meal by itself.  If you order something here, make sure you're hungry because they don 't skimp on the food or portions.   Overall, it was a decent meal for a reasonable amount of money.\n\nThe cook worked efficiently; and everything --  the freezer, toaster, grill -- were within arms reach.  All the time she worked she kept up a running conversation with the two or three regulars.  The banter was equal parts funny and serious.\n\nIt's a cash only business, but does have an ATM squeezed into the small aisle.  If you're looking for classic diner food in a low-key atmosphere, George's will do nicely.",

The Magazine location is where I usually end up going as it is close to my house (and Sunday they usually have happy hour all day and I like to get my double margarita for the price of a single).  I need to disclose that I'm not really  a big fan of Mexican (and I got really REALLY burned out on Mexican food and anything wrapped in a tortilla while I was exiled to Austin for a year and half due to Katrina).  They often play headbanger music (sometimes WAY too loud) so that is a bit of a strange combo of Mexican food meets goth death metal.    \n\nThis can be a great place to eat by yourself and grab a quick bite to eat or go with others and hang out for awhile.  I usually get either the tacos or enchiladas here as it is a quick and relatively cheap meal (they usually bring you the green and red sauce but you have to REQUEST the yellow habanero sauce).  They have a good rotation of different specials (as much variety as can be expected within the limited repertoire of everything has to involve a tortilla in someway Tex-Mex food).  It does get very crowded sometimes and there can be a wait.  The bar usually turns over pretty quick but some days people just linger for awhile. \n\nThey have some very well decorated people working here (and by decorated I mean seriously tattooed up) so it can be entertaining just to watch the staff in action and they do usually provide really good service (the Mid-City location is famous for bad service and that is why I rarely go there).  They make some of the best margarita's in New Orleans and have some good cold beer so a great place to drink and decent place to eat.",

  "text": "Maddening. This should be a 4.5/5 star review. Nashville is at a tipping point when it comes to bars/restaurants. I have heard time and again how difficult it is to find/keep good FOH/kitchen talent but doing so is essential to the business plan. I don't want this city to fizzle out when there's so much potential yet to be tapped. The fact of the matter, though, is when you're asking the buying public to dole out significant dollars, you have to be on top of your craft every time. You do.\n\nMy first experience at Ellington's came during their first week. I was (pleasantly) stunned by how well they tapped into the '70s cool of that era's James Bond, Hart to Hart, The Rockford Files, etc. Rather than depressing, the brass, browns, wood paneling, and large plants set a mood. This was punctuated by the music/muzak. My mood was further elevated by the menu. The choices of classic and signature drinks were well-curated (here, it makes sense to go with the classics). I was happy with my feta/watermelon appetizer and the shrimp & grits were delicious. Despite not having gluten-free desserts, I enjoyed the 1970s-era cups my post-meal coffee came in. I left happy. Very happy.\n\nThen, I came back the following week and the wheels fell off. This time around, the place was busier but not so busy that you couldn't sit. We were warmly greeted by the hostess from the previous week. Rather than being seated by the window (by the patio), we were seated by the wood paneling/mirror banquette. Fine so far. I liked having the new perspective of the dining room. I spied my waitress from the previous week and it looked like we were in her section. Nice! Hopefully she remembered my generous tip. And then we sat. And sat. And sat. We stared awkwardly at each other. My guest started to get annoyed and I got embarrassed. No one interacted with us. We weren't given so much as a glass of water. We felt extremely unwelcome. Finally, our hostess came by with water and a smile... but that was it. The waitress from the previous week who was being so gracious and charming with other tables twisted her body so as not to have to acknowledge us. Again. We sat. And sat. And sat. By this time, I am past being embarrassed. I am angry. A floor manager finally comes by to take our drink order. She says that she put too many covers in our server's section and that was the reason for the protracted delay. A few things about that: 1.) A lot of covers =/= being unable to stop by the table and say, 'Hi, folks. I'll be right with you and I'll have a runner drop some water off to you. Thanks!' 2.) There were other servers/runners in our section joking with and serving customers (who arrived before and after we did). 3.) No mention of 'Let me get you started with some drinks/apps on the house. So sorry for this mix up.' None of these things happened. Rather, after a tepid excuse for being treated like filth and watching our server - the same server I over-tipped the previous week - treat other guests with professionalism, I decided to leave. I went to the host stand, informed them that they could cancel my order and that we were leaving. In the midst of this, who should arrive? Our server. For the first time. Nope. Please continue to ignore us. You were doing that so well. The floor manager took my name and number and offered to have a manager call me. I left Ellington's and retired to the Fairlane lobby. I noticed two people from the restaurant had followed me down there but neither engaged. I used my Yelp app to find another eatery, left and have no plans on returning.\n\nIt's a shame.",

I do want to try dinner here, but it can be a hard table to get as the popularity is growing and size of the restaurant isn't that large. Plan head on this one if you're aiming for dinner, otherwise lunch is a nice option.\n\nThe food during lunch time was excellent, lot of delicious flavors with each dish that made me definitely want to try more of the menu. Well platted aesthetically and well put together chef wise makes the food taste as good as it looks. Definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to trying more from them next time I'm in town.",

I appreciate the asian fetish being spelled out. While this place is pretty small (and therefore often has a wait) it's a pretty cool place to have a low-key delicious dinner. \nYays: fun place to get ramen not in Chinatown with a quick and efficient staff\nNays: i miss the authenticity and didn't really like paying a higher price to sit in a not very comfy place (lots of stools and hard chairs)\n\nIf I lived closed to this noodle bar, I'd pop in more regularly because the food wasn't at all bad-- but not really worth me waiting an hour for.",

  "text": "The farm and fisherman and their bloody beets steak were on the top of my must-have list in Philadelphia.  It took some effort, but I was able to secure a table of 5 with my girlfriends on a Sunday night.  Please make a reservation if you decide to come because this restaurant is small.  It has about 10 tables, very minimalist with a feel of intimacy.  The only complaint I have is the lack of a hostess when my party entered.  Although they were around and about, no one took the initiative to approach us.  Our evening did get better from that point, so it's a non-issue.\n\nWe ordered two of the famous bloody beets steak to share.  This was only my second time trying beets but it made me an instant beets lover!  Now, if only I can have the recipe so I can make my beets like that every time.  That's what the dish does to people.  Even those who hate beets would change their mind.  Oh, it isn't so bad after all.  The yogurt and bulls blood (seriously?) were perfectly harmonious with the beets.  It was sweet and a bit tangy.  Just the right amount of sauce and god, the wonderfully well-cooked beets!  I can't imagine anyone would say this often.\n\nThe second course was the Stuffed Rhode Island Squid with chorizo, a special of the day my server mentioned.  It came with two, perfect to share, and the chorizo and Valencia rice were gooooood.  Chewy squid and soft interior.  It was a delicious combination.  The main course for myself was the stuffed trout.  I was worried that it would be an overkill on \"stuffed\" type of dishes but my server assured me that they are not the same.  I can't decide which I liked more, the stuffed squid or stuffed trout!  The stuffed trout had kale and bacon bits inside with crispy, chewy skin on the outside.  Not to mention, the farm and the fisherman makes the best sauce to compliment their dishes.\n\nI was honestly very happy with my choice - in restaurant and the dishes.  It is currently the best overall meal I've had in Philly (and I've definitely been eating well..thank you Philadelphia and your never ending list of good eats!)\n\nBy the way,  I made the reservation on yelp!!  This is way cool :)",

Good, but not great, and definitely still worth a try if you're craving tacos/Mexican.\n\nThe good: Beautiful atmosphere and fun as well. The tacos are good sized portions and the prices are reasonable. A good mix of options to choose from taco-wise. \n\nThe bad: The food was surprisingly bland. The tacos were good but over hyped, the chips were stale and cold and salty, and the salsa and guac were underwhelming. All good, but nothing great.

I love it because it's inexpensive and good with a HUGE, HUGE amount of vegetarian options! \n\nYeah, the place is kind of kitschy in atmosphere, but it's big and there is rarely, if ever a wait. It's also clean. Service here is usually pretty good. We went last night with the International Supper club, and the service was lacking a bit, but there were 25 of us (they knew in advance though.. and only 1 server). I'll cut them slack because usually the service is good.\n\nAs for food, even though TCC is owned by the same people as several Thai places in the area, they just have THE BEST spring rolls - fried, of course! They are small and come with this amazing sweet and spicy sauce. YUM!! I also always get a Thai ice tea to accompany it. It is pretty sweet, but I love it. I usually order number 51, which is noodles in a brown sauce with broccoli (I don't get tofu or meat, just veggies). My most recent experience, I got #66, Masman curry, which was extremely yummy!! I got it mild (I'm a wimp) but it had a little spice to it and lots of veggies, potatoes and peanuts. The serving is more than enough.\n\nDefinitely my go to place when it comes to Thai!",

  "text": "I came here with my friend who had a gift card to partake in the float experience. This review is based on my feelings and my feelings alone.\n\nCustomer service was great and super friendly and considerate. He was sweet, hospitable, and super accommodating. There are no qualms about customer service and atmosphere of my visit. If anything, he is what carrying this 2 star instead of 1 star experience. \n\n The float  tank itself seemed a bit disgusting. Not by any means because of the type of water it was, but inside the tank on the walls and crevices were disgusting. I have posted photos to verify this. If I am knowingly aware floating in treated water that other naked bodies are in rotation in and plus the built up grime on the interior walls, that didn't really give me a firm chance to be at ease during this experience. I feel that it is important to maintain a level of hygiene when experiencing this and though I felt hygiene was done right with the first part of the visit, being in the tank itself left me with a sickening feeling of disgust. Like I said, I am not unfamiliar to using spa treatments and things similar to this experience. It is simply a matter of cleanliness.\n\nWhat I can say about this experience once you get over the disgust is that I did feel relaxed and enjoyed the chance to remove my mind from all exteriors and simply relax. It was a great environment for the right purpose, but I did feel unsettled due to the constant feeling of being in a place that hadn't been cleaned properly from my point of view. I am purely going on first impression. As someone who has never done this before, no one wants to get into a tank and see reminiscence of God knows what on the walls and around the filters or jets.\n\nWould I give this another try? Yes, but only after I felt that the place had been properly sanitized in the tanks. I am happy to reconsider my experience and rating of Float Nashville if I better understood why it looked like this and felt like I was floating around in something unsanitary - chemicals or not.",

The neon open sign let me know it was in fact open. Boy, you can never tell a book by it cover. When we entered, we were taken aback by how nice the inside and decor was. We were quickly seated and given some veggies in a red pepper vinaigrette dressing and hot tea. The food was amazing. The wonton soup was the best I ever had. I had the shredded beef with hot pepper. It was fantastic and the perfect balance between spicy heat and flavorful meat. The general tsos was sweet with a great kick. Fried rice and chow fun rounded out a great meal.

Thankfully I did so, and when I walked in at 6pm on Saturday night, I gave a slightly condescending smile as I breezed past the couple who had been told that the next available reservation was at 9:30pm. Sorry, not sorry. \nTip 2: this is a small plates type place so plan accordingly. I didn't do much reading besides making the reservation and seeing that this place is a top pick on Eater.com. I should've read up more on the menu and portion size. Being from the Midwest, I'm a big eater, and little plate meals never fill me up. I lucked out when my tofu bowl was a sufficient dinner portion. My husband wasn't so thrilled to find a small plate sized portion for his hanger steak and had to order sliders to accompany it. That said, everything we tried was excellent. I was especially impressed that they offered a tofu bowl here, along with other vegetation options. My impression of New Orleans is that it's a big meat-eating place, so it was nice to see additional, well executed, meal options. \nTip 3: bring cash to tip the entertainment. The singers were great and they walk around with their tip jar after their set. Don't be the ahole who doesn't have cash to give them.",

Both were equally pleasing in their own way (stout was full of flavor--porter was lovely and smooth with subtle notes of chocolate).\n\nWe ordered at the bar and took our beers to their upstairs seating area. The atmosphere downstairs is open, industrial, and a skosh on the noisy side. Upstairs it's a little quieter, a little comfier, and a bit more chill.  \n\nPlus--foosball anyone? \n\nWe were able to chill in relative peace, overlooking the activity below for 45 minutes.  I'm not sure the waitstaff actually serves up there (servers came upstairs and cleared away empties--but didn't address us other than that).  But, truly, the place is so small, and the service at the bar was so quick and friendly, I have no probably heading to the bar for refills.\n\nThe downstairs bar/seating area opens up to a small patio area as well.  It's not fancy, and a little no frills--but you can definitely enjoy a brew while sitting in the fresh autumnal air.\n\nFor my part, I could definitely see myself heading down to enjoy a brew and chill sesh in their upstairs loft.\n\nGet to it!",

  "text": "This restaurant came very highly recommended to me, so I had to try it a short while back. These Danny Boy Fajitas were also specifically recommended, since fajitas with a combo of meats is a fave of mine. \n\nThe food was good, but not quite to my personal liking. It was definitely missing some kind of sauce or salsa. Not sure if it usually comes with it or not. That would have gone a long way. I didn't ask for any, because the server was in the back for quite awhile and until I was almost finished. I often have a late lunch when I'm out and about, so probably catching some of these restaurants at the wrong time or something. It's unfortunate. I also read something just now about the chips and salsa being kept full. I did not get any at all. Hmmm.\n\nIt was filling and the meats, onions, and peppers were grilled to perfection. There were some other reviews complaining about the low number of tortillas. Definitely not enough tortillas for all the filling, but I couldn't eat it all in one setting anyway.  ;)  By the way, if you go with the corn tortillas, you get one more (probably smaller, though). It definitely was not an issue for me. I like to eat a lot of the goodies on their own anyway.\n\nI can maybe see myself returning some day, but I will definitely get something else on the menu since in my opinion there are several others that do fajitas better.  I did see some other rather tasty-looking dishes come out to other tables when I first arrived.",

  "text": "Quick tips: Delicious and deceivingly strong house margaritas. They have one of my favorite quesos. Veggie tacos are build your own - onions spinach and bell peppers made for a good mix, they have loads of veggies to choose from. \n\nFood: um i love their queso, I want to bathe in the queso. The only drawback was the queso was a little bit small, but I guess if I wanted to bathe in it, anything would be small. The combo tacos are best with the double layered corn tortillas. Don't forget the house margarita, which is so well crafted you forget you are drinking tequila until you are stumbling out the door after your second (yes I'm a lightweight!) \n\nService: great service! Our waiter was super nice and funny. \n\nAmbiance- I wish they had a better waiting area in the front. There was a long line to eat, but we were served quickly. Have a margarita while you wait and go window shopping!",

  "text": "This place is extremely overrated. First of all, it is at the heart of downtown Indy, so goodluck on finding parking. If you want to park anywhere nearby, you need to pay that notorious $20.\nSecondly, this place is very snooty. Asked if I made a reservation for lunch? I don't see any Michelin stars nor do I see you being all full. In fact I find plenty of tables open and only 1 person at the bar. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant, a party of 2. We were seated at this super small table 1 end connected to the booth another with a chair. The table was wobbly. I am sorry but our table was already full with just water cups and condiments, how were we going to put plates on it? Asked if we could move to a booth, after waiting for 5 min, hostess came back and said they all other tables had reservation and this is the only table they could seat us at. Now I really have a problem with restaurants that do not give their upmost to customer service, because otherwise, what are you? The restaurant was at most 20% full on a Saturday lunch time. By the time we left, it was still around 20% full, so why couldn't we have sat somewhere else? We asked if we could put two tables together, and they agreed, thank the lord, otherwise I think I would have walked out. \n\nOther than this, stay away from the salsa and chips. They were no good. Though they are unlimited you won't want to get more than 1 batch. Salsa did not have any flavors and chips had a weird texture and super greasy. I looked around the restaurant and it seems like most people also did not touch their chips.\n\nOrdered the pork belly taco and was advised to add the egg. I do agree. Probably one of the most perfectly cooked sunny side up egg I've seen. Too bad the pork belly did not taste good and the rest of the taco was meh. Other person in my party had the chicken taco, he said it was just ok. I ordered the beans and rice and seriously, I thought I was missing rice. It came out with the beans super puree and it was poured on top of the rice, it was super small portion wise and it did not have much rice in it at all. We also got their so called fries, which are not fries but wet potato wedges. They had this special house sauce which is like mayo mixed with bbq essentially. That side was kind of weird, so be careful if you are not into something too different.\n\nThe biggest thing I have to rave about this place is the decor and ambiance. Very very cute, even the bathroom. Makes me wish my apartment was decorated this way. But what is the point if their food and service was no good. Our waitress was probably over occupied. She never refilled our water, though she was courteous she tried hard to get tips, I don't blame her. She tried to strike a few awkward small talks.",

  "text": "The Rusty Pelican is a fusion of an upscale dining room and elegant banquet rooms with a water view. The place is normally dimly lit during the evening and brings a great atmosphere for a romantic date or just a casual rendezvous. The price is pretty decent for French and Italian style cuisine and for their specialty seafood dishes. They also have a pianist that plays classical to modern music and valet parking during the evening on the weekends. \n\nThey give complimentary sour dough and raisin and nut bread. I love when restaurants give you something while waiting for your food. My favorite dish is Seafood Mixed Grill which includes Salmon, Balsamic & Sweet Vermouth Sauce, Crab cake, Mango Coulis, and a Skewer of Shrimp and Scallops topped with Citrus Beurre Rouge and is about $23. The salmon was grilled perfectly! Other times I've tried their specials of the week and they're pretty unique and good. On my friend's birthday she also received a free fiery creme brulee. It was pretty sweet! But considering the prices, with a party of 4, the total bill can be up to $100. That's pretty pricey for my lifestyle, but it's fun once in awhile for a nice occasion.\n\nOverall, the service was pretty good on a busy night. The servers are warm and welcoming, and are pretty pleasing and attentive. But on a really busy night, they might be bombarded with huge parties and sometimes it's not that great and it gets pretty loud.\n\nBe sure to call in for reservations and ask for a window table, it's worth the wait and is pretty great when you can watch random things so close by. \n\nThe only downside is that the location is pretty hidden and kind of difficult to find the first time. Google search their location. Also, they have only one restroom in the entire building. So if you can, go before you go...",

I've been a fan of this business for a long time, but I'm even more of a fan now with this second location practically in my damn back yard.\n\nNo matter what kinda beer you drink, they've got you covered.  If they don't, ask about their seasonal options.  If they have the tripel, GET IT!  If they have the Summer Days, GET IT!  Ask questions later.\n\nHungry?  No problem.  From pizza to burgers and pasta entrées, again they've got you covered.  During this most recent trip, La Chica and I split the following and left STUFFED.\n\nAle Cheese Dip - Hands down the best beer cheese dip I've ever had.  Lacked the awkward bitterness of most beer cheese dips.  Just smooth and light, like an American lager.  Comes with what seems like a whole damn loaf of bread.\n\nButcher Burger - Very, very good, but very, very busy!  With 3 meats in the burger, it's a lot for my taste buds to take in.  And then with all the toppings, forget about it.  It should be called the sensory overload burger.  And with a $14 price tag, I'd suggest sticking to one of their regular burgers.\n\nI saw someone order a calzone, and WTF?  Who is eating that thing?  It was the size of a small child.\n\nService was fantastic.  Bathrooms were extremely clean, and they have a system in place that catches waste water, and they use it for irrigation.  Being green makes green!\n\nWill definitely be returning, and sooner than later.",

  "text": "Much to my surprise, the Tudor Glen Medicentre (that has been there my whole life) closed on August 31st and moved to McKenney.\n\nI haven't been to a Medicentre in years, so forgive me if my complaints are just par for the course... but I was really not happy with my visit.\n\nFirst of all, on a Sunday, there are 2 receptionist working, but only one doctor.  When I checked in, the lady said the wait would not be very long.  She didn't give any specifics - I should have asked.  The wait was 2 hours in the waiting room and then over 20 minutes in the exam room before the doctor came in.  I'm actually not complaining about the wait - It's good to know that the doctor takes his time with the patients.  But there was a serious issue with inconsistent messages coming from the front desk staff.\n\nI sat down, and the next person who came in and went to check in was told the wait would be over an hour.  What?  Is that what we call \"not very long\"?  okay... weird but whatever, I'm already there.\n\nThe next person that came in was told the wait would be 2 hours.\n\nThe 10 - 15 people who came in after me were all quoted between 1 and two hours - very inconsistently.  \n\nA lady came in with a UTI (I shouldn't have been able to hear that, but the chairs are set up very closely to the front desk) and when she said she couldn't wait two hours, she was told to come back tomorrow.  \n\nOnce I was in the exam room, I noticed two signs on the wall.  They each stated that 2 different doctors will not prescribe T3s, T4s or Tramadol (one will not prescribe any narcotics).  I understand the apprehension of prescribing such medication to patients that you are not familiar with, since this is purely a walk in situation.... but shouldn't those signs be placed in the waiting room?  Imagine waiting 2 plus hours to get in just to find out that the doctor won't prescribe what you're there for.\n\nAnyway.... I'm sure I'll be back since I think this is the only Medicentre in town.  but... meh.",

  "text": "I can't tell you how happy I am to finally have a great Italian restaurant in the neighborhood! While I loved Fitler Dining Room, it was more of a once in a while restaurant for us. I can see Trattoria Carina popping up on the rotation far more often. \n\nThe restaurant was buzzing on Saturday night - we lucked into one of the last open tables outside and it wasn't long before people were placed on a wait. At this time, reservations are not accepted. I kind of like it - there aren't many places that offer first come first served, so Carina is perfect for a night when you didn't plan ahead but still want a nice dinner.\n\nThere is a short list of cocktails and also red, white, rosé and sparkling wine, which you can get by the glass or bottle. The menu is broken into starters, salads, pastas, mains and sides. We wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered the meatballs, pumpkin salad, tagliatelle with bolognese, shells with crab, branzino and broccoli. \n\nI thought all of the food was nicely prepared and presented and tasted great. I love a good plate of pasta and neither of our pasta dishes let me down. The shells may have won out by a small margin - the tomato sauce was just spicy enough and I loved the toasted breadcrumbs for some texture. The branzino was perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed the citrusy tomato salad underneath. Also, those meatballs! If Carina ever opens for lunch, I really hope they put a meatball sandwich on the menu. \n\nI'm looking forward to many more meals at this neighborhood gem!",

Our large party ordered just appetizers and we had leftovers. The service was excellent and the orders were perfect, no mistakes. We basiclly tried one of every appetizer and everyone loved every single thing. I obviously can't remember the names for everything, but it was helpful that there were a few people of Indian descent in our group to help everyone enjoy the dishes that weren't obvious to figure out. Some needed sauce on top then eaten in one bite, others needed something spread on bread. Overall I can't wait to go back with my mom because she'll love the vegetarian options available. My dad will love it too because they can make most things without any spice at all.",

It was a great dish and the flavors worked well together.\nThe duck leg dish with risotto was also very good. Earthy tone to it. A little heavy, which is expected. Very delicious.\nEvery dish was very well done. I would return for the beet steak in a heartbeat and also for the red snapper.\nService was very friendly and attentative. Cannot beat a BYO.

The first experience and memory I have had of Forest Park, being that I did not grow up around here or explored much when I first moved here, was the skating rink. Yes, I know... Everyone is boasting about all the fun things to do in the spring and summer and here I go ruining it with ice and cold weather.  However, I feel that this is noteworthy if you are interested in outdoor ice skating. The only problem is, you would have to make sure it's cold enough outside.\n\nThe park is also a wonderful spot for photographs whether it be an engagement, wedding or just for fun! There are so many different and beautiful view around Forest Park for such occasions.\n\nThe art museum is another wonderful place to visit while in Forest Park. I could spend a whole day there! They have some wonderful arts and artifacts to marvel at for hours at a time. The best part is, it's free. There is a paid parking garage for $15 and $5 for members. I was curious and checked out the membership fee and saw that a year's worth of membership is actually very reasonable for one or 2 people. I was pleasantly surprised!\n\nOf course, there are scenic trails if you want to walk/run/jog and people-watch. There are so many beautiful things to do and see in Forest park. You just have to come check it out!",

We came for the oysters, and found the whole oyster experience to be somewhat unpleasant. \n\nAs for the entrees, the duck I had was tough, rubbery, and a bit overcooked. The seared tuna was tasty enough and comes in huge slabs (on the salad or as a entree), but was not spectacular or unique, and it's pretty tough to mess up seared tuna. \n\nFor the prices here, I expected the food to be much better than it was. The service was pleasant. However, there are way too many delicious restaurants in New Orleans to waste your time at this one.",

  "text": "COVID-19 indoor dining review: whenever I come back to see my parents in Jersey, this is the only restaurant I insist on coming back to, every time (I actually only recently learned the actual name, we always call it \"Amy's place\"). Came by for dinner on Christmas Day, and while there were a LOT of cars in the parking lot, people were mostly there waiting for takeout. Inside the restaurant, there were only three small parties (including us), and we were all spaced at opposite ends of the restaurant. The servers all wore masks and stood back when taking your order - felt very safe! \n\nAlways get the spicy fish with silky tofu, the eggplant, the Chongqing chicken, and the beef with spicy peppers. SO much food, with enough for a full meal of leftovers. I've also had a lot of takeout from Szechuan House and the food travels/reheats very well!",

This one was clean and the counter help was very friendly.  So the burger was good and fries were fresh.... So I would try this one again.  When they deliver the food to the tables they seem like they generally concerned about your dinning experience.  She asked it I wanted any more dipping sauce or any thing else.  Good job Carl's Jr!",

  "text": "Was really craving Pad Thai and found this spot on Yelp so decided to give it a try.  It was about 45mins prior to their closing so we placed the order online and headed right over to pick it up.\n\nThe restaurant is off the side of a main road, and is very easy to drive right by if you're not paying attention -- so be attentive and slow down early.\n\nThere are about three parking spots in front and a few more to the left of the building.  Due to COVID they are only doing take out and delivery, with the option of eating your food on one of their outside bench tables, with an umbrella to help block the sun.\n\nI ordered a tofu and shrimp pad thai which came out to be about $14.  The portion size here is definitely for a family as the pad thai lasted me for 4 meals!  The Thai Hot was spicy and had good flavor but I feel it completely took away from the other flavors pad thai should have; e.g. tamarind.  Nonetheless the pad thai was great here and I would definitely order it again.\n\nThe following day, because the pad thai was so good, I wanted to try something else on their menu.  So I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken in medium this time.  Same deal here with the portion size, although this one lasted me only 3 meals -- thinking it was the extra protein that allows for an extra meal.  The flavor was great, but the heat for medium was not hot enough, so thinking next time I'll try their hot (in between medium and Thai hot).\n\nIf you're in the area and craving Thai food, so far, this is the place to beat.",

The parking is just street parking, but I've never had a hard time finding a mostly close spot.  They're not always the quickest when there's a line, but usually if that's the case, I'll head somewhere else to get my sweet snack.\n\nThey have a great selection of ice creams, and they rotate some of the flavors depending on the season.  The service is hit or miss, but the ice cream is delicious, so you put up with the lines or lack of seating.  Taking it to go is almost always the best option, and there are other places nearby if you want to take your snack and walk around.  \n\nThey also have espresso, so if you're an affogato fan, they've got you covered.",

Much more varied and interesting selection of products than the standard Giant/Pathmark/Acme ::shudder:: fare.  But let's face it:  the prices here make this great food utterly unaffordable for most working people with multiple mouths to feed.  I understand that that results from factors beyond Whole Foods' management, but it's still not acceptable that the 'best' food is unreachable for so many families.  If Trader Joe's weren't a few blocks south, there wouldn't be an affordable large food retailer in the Logan area.  Here's to you, Trader, a place where I can get bags of food for $30.  Rant over.  \n\nWhole Foods highlights: the coconut oil (which is a solid-funky!) in the body section is a sensual moisturizer.  It melts from a soft solid into a liquid with the heat of your fingertips.  If you have dry hair, introduce it to this oil.  The prepared foods make excellent quick meals.  The 365 product line is the company's stab at an affordable option; I appreciate the gesture.",

We called in for a pizza pick up right when they opened at 5pm (according to my boyfriend their pizza oven is fairly small and could only hold a few pies...) We ordered a 3-topping 10\" deep dish and were told that it'll take 45 mins. (Yikes! 45 minutes? Well it is a deep dish...) \n\nTo keep this short the 45 minute wait was well worth it. Blackthorn deep dish is not a true Chicago deep dish but it's still pretty tasty and filling. I can't get over the tomato sauce they use. The sauce is savory with nice heat to it. It's very distinct in flavor. Also the crust is cooked to perfection; not too soggy and not too crispy. \n\nPre-warning: Blackthorn is a dive bar. It's not your Chuck-e-cheese or Deweys joint, so I wouldn't recommend bringing your kids here. \n\nOverall, I'm satisfied and glad to try this hidden gem.",

  "text": "What is the pink sauce?!\n\nFeeling lazy, I went and ordered take out. The ordering process was smooth, and they quickly brought out my food. There were also a few other people ordering take out.\n\nI ordered the Ichiban roll - salmon, masago and unagi wrapped in crunchy. I didn't really know what \"crunchy\" was, but I decided to take my chances anyways. As I expected, they were tempura flakes, but different to those I'm used to, these were really small / smushed flakes and seemed like it was quite old. The salmon, eel and masago themselves were fresh from what I can taste. The salmon was fatty, but still had the silver lining on it (which I kind of dislike, but since it was hidden in the roll, I wasn't too bothered). Now, what really almost made me want to gag is... the pink sauce.\n\nWhat is the pink sauce?! It was a bright-ish pink color and had the consistency of mayonnaise. So, think pink colored liquid soap. That's what it looked like. The adventurous side of me decided to taste it - pretty much a sweet mayonnaise sauce. But, I just couldn't get over the color and the artificial-ness of it all, and pushed the sauce, along with most of the \"crunchy\" to the side.\n\nWhile I like traditional sushi, I also love American sushi creations drenches in house special sauces, but crazy sushi's pink sauce was a bit more than I could handle. My search for sushi creations continues.",

  "text": "Most of our vacation in New Orleans this summer was rainy for some part of every day. But that was not going to stop us!!! On a day that started off like it was going to be a complete wash with dark threatening clouds rolling in, we were hoping a Swamp Tour 30 minutes outside the city would save the day. Met a vendor while walking down Canal Street near Harrah's and he suggested Cajun Encounters. He recommended we drive to the location ourselves to save money since we had our own car, so we did. \n\nGETTING THERE -\nQuestioning the intelligence of our decision as we drove through a storm while exiting the city, we were delighted to find clear skies just a few miles after hitting the road. A quick prayer for a good day seemed to be answered as those dark clouds decided not to follow us... which made for a beautiful day in Slidell, LA.\n\nWell off the main highway you will find them near an old mechanical bridge. Once inside, you'll may find a small line to pay for your tour. You'll then receive a colored rubber bracelet indicating your tour group. We were very fortunate to have Captain Mike, a down to earth born and bred Cajun who really knew those swamps.\n\nTHE TOUR -\nThe first half of the tour was quite boring as Captain Mike went  over a little history of the Bayou and drove high speed thu the more open areas of the swamp. IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO SEE GATORS, this will be a hit or miss experience. We saw a few, but they were reclusive and didn't seem to be interested in the hot dogs Capt'n Mike was beating on the water to coerce their attention.\n\nBut then we turned down a narrow heavily tree'd area where you could feel branches scraping the bottom of the boat. Wife was totally paranoid we would get shipwrecked or something and Capt'n Mike didn't help as he side swiped a few large trees... lol!!! You should have seen her face.\n\nTHE BEST PART -\nWell, we came to rest in a small cove and Mike pulls out Bryan, a little one foot alligator and my kids go nuts!!!! Normally well behaved children, I politely had to apologize to several people after Mike asked \"who wants to hold Bryan\". We were at the front of the boat you see, and Capt'n Mike and Bryan were at the rear. If any of the passengers from our tour are reading this, I sincerely hope your feet are feeling better after being trampled by our overexcited boys!\n\nBryan was a big hit, and the boys enthusiasm gave several more people courage to hold the little fella, including my wife. But the big prize was yet to come. Mike spotted a HUGE gator who was not shy at all. For this gator he used a stick to dangle the hot dog and what came next drew lots of Oooo's and Aaaaaahhhh's. This gator came a clean 4 feet out of the water to grab this hot dog and we were amazed. It was just what we were hoping to see!!! Saw some other stuff on the boat ride back after that encounter but didn't care. That huge gator and little Bryan were all we talked about for a few hours. Hopefully your experience will be as good.",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner on a random Saturday around 6. Very risky since all the restaurants in the St Pete pier area are always crowded. We did manage to get two seats at the bar immediately, which was fine for us. Our bartender/server approached us quickly with menus, but then took a while to take our initial drink order. Once he came back I ordered the Dragon Mojito, which was very good and delivered quickly. We ordered the cheesy bread appetizer to start. It is incredibly cheesy and actually a bit greasy, but had good flavor and was perfect for someone starving like me. We placed our order, chicken taco salad and tropical salad with blackened mahi added on. I wanted to wait to finish my bread and eat some of it with my salad so I waited, waited, and waited some more. Finally our bartender returned and apologized for our salads taking a while saying it was indeed his fault for waiting too long to put them into the system. He offered to make another drink, which I was not initially going to do, but waiting longer made me want another. We then waited some more. He finally went back himself to check on the salads and they finally came. This wait time total was about 45 minutes to an hour. Luckily the salads were great, the mahi was cooked perfectly, and both were nicely dressed. The tropical salad had so many flavors and toppings and all worked well together. The chicken taco salad was also very good and was the equivalent of ordering a couple loaded tacos. The food saved this review for me. Our bartender did apologize and admitted to it being his mistake the food took so long. Not sure if I will return, at least not during a busier time.",

  "text": "So, this place has changed quite a bit since my first review in 2011. I thought my review deserved an update, as I've been twice this month.\n\nThere are reservations now. Per their policies, you are only allowed to stay at a dining table for 1.5 hours, no matter how much you order. I'm not sure how strictly this is policed. The pair of hostesses were not particularly welcoming or helpful, but we were able to get a reservation for about two hours after we arrived (spent our wait down the street). Originally we were told that we could possibly take the table of a group that was running late; they had 5 more minutes. Apparently they arrived while we waited outside, but we were not informed and just kept waiting without any notice that it would be another hour. Not the best customer service.\n\nBUT otherwise this place is awesome. Both times we were there, Shotgun Jazz Band was playing. The second time, Washboard Chaz joined in spontaneously! Both times, the band was lively and entertaining. They played loudly enough that the whole restaurant could hear but not too loud that you couldn't have a conversation if you wanted. They play for tips, so don't forget your cash!\n\nThe food is delicious - I'd still recommend the fries, but also the mac and cheese, bulgogi bowl, and the steak and cake. The steak and cake was tender strips of steak with a crab cake, fried to perfection - a little crispy on the outside but warm and soft in the middle. I'd eat one right now. Get the homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert! And, their signature, gin-based cocktail The Muse is lovely and refreshing.\n\nAlso, the service from our waitress, who also is one of the managers I believe, was EXCELLENT. My friend asked if there were any warm drinks because her throat was sore. Our waitress said there wasn't, but she brought out a glass of hot water with honey. How sweet is that?! It's thoughtful touches like that that are so memorable to customers. Also, she told us about the discount for locals!\n\nI'll be happy to continue bringing out of town guests here, and maybe showing up just for a fun weekend again soon.",

Our server was cheerful and attentive. The beer list has many collaborations and I loved the sour options. Try the collective sour of its still on the menu. Yum! \n\nI ordered the smoked wings with orange marmalade marinade. They were cooked to perfection. I prefer smaller, non jumbo wings and these were big and juicy. If you like this style, give them a try. They have all homemade sauces and you can tell the care they take in the preparation. \n\nMy husband's burger was good. We've had better but very enjoyable. \n\nOverall an excellent experience and I can't wait to return.",

  "text": "I am an avid fan of CL Deals, so when this certificate became available with an additional promotional code I snatched up two. So I waited to complete this review until after I had used both. Now after having gone two times, once for lunch and once for dinner, I am not impressed.\n\nThe reviews rave about the dim sum. Maybe my palate isn't as refined as I think but I wasn't impressed. I selected three items from the dim sum menu before deciding to just order off the menu when I went for lunch. I was disappointed cause I have had great dim sum before.  The walking menu really appealed to me but here there are only a few options which they keep on the cart, which are mostly the baked options. All of the steamed or fried options are prepared once ordered.  Fearing that I would not get full, I also ordered the lettuce wraps to accompany the dim sum.  They were actually well flavored but very oily. \n\nWhen I visited the next time, it was for a late dinner with a girl friend. We ordered the chicken teriyaki and seaweed salad. The service was slow just as it was when I visited for lunch. Once delivered the seaweed salad was still frozen. When we brought it to the attention of the server, she seemed shocked. Only after pulling out a piece with ice on it did she believe us and respond. The only thing they did was nuke the salad which we could see since the kitchen is open. This let us know that the salad is not freshly prepared in house.  The chicken teriyaki however was freshly prepared of which I am glad since it took so long for it to be delivered. The flavor was good and the portion was sufficient for one. If not for the cost, I would probably order this more often since it is much better than you will find at the Chinese choose your number restaurants.",

I was truly living my best life as I was eating the cookies and cream cookie dough. \n\nService: Friendly as can be and they will let you sample any dough that speaks to you.\nAtmosphere: Clean, simple and fun.\nDough: YAS. You really can't go wrong with any flavor but my favorite of the samples I tried was the cookies and cream. What's better than OREOs in cookie dough? Try and argue with me. You won't. You order scoops similar to an ice cream shop. I was fully convinced I was going to order two scoops until I saw one of the cookie monsters (not their official name just being punny and cute) scoop a one scoop into it's cup. HOLY ONE SCOOP. It was three small scoops combined into one giant scoop! Now, no shame if you're heart's pulling you towards that double scoop.

  "text": "It was a cold night at the end of a long and arduous year, and COVID19 precautions had made dining out (literally, in little wooden sidewalk pod enclosures) less than completely appealing. But this lady was determined to still have a nice chef-prepared dinner for her wedding anniversary, and she was going to trek out by bus and trudge through icy air to get it.\n\nItalian pasta was the plan, and after much searching on Yelp (whereby I discovered many COVID19-related closures), I finally found Bistro La Baia. With promising reviews, we decided to try this option on the outskirts of Rittenhouse Square. Lobster ravioli for me, and penne arrabiata for the significant other. The food was ready right on time when I arrived, and came with a complimentary bundled of delicious slices of Italian bread that practically crackles when bitten into.\n\nThe entrees were quite good as well. The ravioli consisted of six pieces, two sauteed shrimp and a rich, creamy tomato sauce. That and half a piece of the Italian bread made for a perfectly portioned and delicious meal for me. The penne arrabiata was a larger portion, and while not the best ever, it still met with the S.O.'s overall approval.\n\nThe sidewalk seating wooden pods were empty when I arrived, but that was before 6PM, so maybe the restaurant was busier later in the evening. It really gave me the impression of the sort of place that would primarily be frequented by residents of the surrounding neighborhoods. The one person I interacted with there was very polite and helpful (even giving me time to put my mittens back on before handing me the food for my journey home). I probably wouldn't have thought to try Bistro La Baia under most circumstances, so it was a nice discovery. I hope that it'll be able to survive the wave of restaurant closures that Philadelphia has seen as a result of the pandemic.",

My gal pal Stacy got a group of random friends together (couples date day downtown) and we all paid her our $25/pp in advance for the 2 hour tour around the city.  Rain or shine it said and it rained ....and we still had a blast.  I didn't pedal (too short and too lazy) but it was a lot of fun to ride (on the back and the side).  We brought our own beers and blasted an Ipod full of ridiculous tunes as we pedaled through the city on a busy Saturday afternoon.  For all of those cars who got stuck behind us, we're sorry but come on!  It was fun to watch us ride, right?\n\nIt's a bar on wheels....but there are rules.  Alcohol cannot leave the bike, no serving beers to pedestrians (aka - not a \"real\" bar that way) and stay on time or there's a late fee.  We managed to follow the rules, have a great time and no one threw up from drinking and riding.  That's a score in my book.\n\nWe made two \"pit\" stops - one on Mass and one on Meridian to urinate and take a shot.  Then we continued on the ride, switching seats and making new friends along the way.\n\nThis is great for groups of any kind - you do not have to drink but it does make it a little more fun with a buzz.  This bike is ridiculous and awesome at the same time.  You don't have to be super active or in great shape (after all, there are 10 riders) but if you don't want to be outside they say to stay at home.  And there are no rainchecks for bad weather (even snow) so don't get whiny if the sun isn't out.  We rode in partial downpour and it was even more fun than I thought it would be!  \n\nI am considering this as an option for a birthday party outing, girls' night out, the list goes on for who would enjoy this little bit of rowdy fun!  Everyone seemed to really get a kick of out it and for those of us who have lived in Indy a long time, it's nice to see something new and different enter the area with a bit of creative energy that can be enjoyed while consuming alcohol or not.",

We were pleasantly surprised upon arriving when they seated us, they decorated our table with confetti and gave us a nice card signed by the entire staff! From start to finish, Ronnie was exceptional as well as the entire staff. They truly made tonight memorable. Okay. Now to the rest of the review. \nThis is a actually the second time I've been here and each time has been phenomenal. The decor is modern with just the right lighting to set the ambiance to a more intimate setting, even with the open floor plan. \nWe ordered the chilled seafood tower and let me tell you it was amazing! The King crab does not disappoint. We also shared the Bone-in 20 oz. ribeye which was cooked to our specifications. Another success for the night. The crispy Brussels sprouts with bacon would make a kid think it was candy and beg for more. \nI could keep rambling on and on about how great the whole experience was but I'm already looking forward to my next visit! Fleming's does a wonderful job making us feel like royalty for the night! Fine dining at its finest! Bravo!",

  "text": "I love Latin food, but I don't want to go to deep DEEP north Philly and I'm not always up to spending what they spend at the Center City spots. So Parada Maimon is a good compromise. Most of the times I've been here I've gotten the pernil with rice and black beans. I've tried the half chicken, the gizzards, and the mofongo. The chicken was good enough that I brought some home to my family. It was a hit. The price can't really be beaten. For those wondering, you can sub out rice and beans for some fries... or maybe some other side they're offering. \n\nWhat issues did I have? You can either order at the counter or you can have a seat. The counter (cafeteria style) food is ready-made while most other things are made to order. My first impression was underwhelming... as the pernil I had was dry. I didn't know to ask for gravy since I ordered from the menu. That wasn't enough to keep me away because I came back and had the mofongo and I didn't like it much. I mentioned in a review for another place that I don't fault the establishment. I just didn't know what I was getting into because it more or less tastes the same everywhere I've tried it. There was a little confusion in the portions... they should just say large and small, but instead they say lunch and dinner if I remember correctly.\n\nSo for the best dine-in experience... order at the counter, if you're not fluent in Spanish then English is fine...mostly (I got a verbal judo flip with my basic Spanish), state what sauces/gravy you want on your food and then have a seat. Also, get one of their fresh juices (Chinola for me). If you really want to EAT get the dinner (large) portion, but if you're there for the deal get the lunch (small). \n\nSo with a large plate of pernil with a good amount of gravy, some hot sauce and oil for the rice, and some thousand island or whatever for the little salad... I'm NICE! I think they have tres leches too, but I've been too full to try it.\n\nPRO-TIP: And ask for maduros... I don't think they're included, but I don't think they're extra. It's just like 3 or 4 and anyway.\n\nFUN FACT: The area is desolate so there's really no best way in or out on foot. You're catching alleys, bums, and long empty stretches on all sides. Seriously, don't let that stop you from checking this place out.",

  "text": "A local favorite!  Blenders in the Grass is a perfect alternative for when you're sick of Jamba Juice.  The concept is similar but I think Blenders has a more creamy, smoothie taste whereas Jamba Juice has more of a tangy, fruity taste.  \n\nAll the smoothies are 24oz. and come with a free Super supplement or 2 Single supplements.  My favorite flavor by far is the Strawberry Colada which is made with pineapple juice, strawberries, coconut, pineapple sherbet and ice milk.  But really, all of the flavors are delicious.  If you manage to do the impossible and can't find something on the menu you'd like to try, that also offer a Build Your Own Blender option where you can choose any ingredients for your smoothie.  They also offer juices and Wheat grass shots.  \n\nSomething else worth mentioning is that they can make any smoothie non-dairy by substituting a soy base.  At about $5 per smoothie, it is a tad pricey, but worth it for a nice cold treat on a warm Santa Barbara day.",

We head out to the area that was most effected by Hurricane Katrina. That was interesting to see. As we drive through town our guide points out random restaurant (I wasn't on a food tour?) We get to St. Louis Cemetery No. 3 and we stop. We walked around for like 5 minutes and didn/t even see half of the cemetery? Then we head out to the city park which I was actually happy about because I wanted to visit the sculpture garden. We barely had any time to be there either! A little over 1 minutes and then it started to rain. We head back into town and go through the garden district which was nice but most of the houses were on the opposite side of the bus. Overall the tour was just alright. I felt like I really didn't see much unfortunately.",

I was having a grumpy day (they don't care) having woken up with sleep paralysis (stop writing Justin this is irrelevant) and that threw me into a really weird mood (for the love of God please stop) but my dad still wanted to go get lunch with me thankfully. WAM! Suddenly we were having FANTASTIC seafood!\n\nEverything we ordered: Clam chowder, steamed clams, fried oyster po boy, garlic bread. It was all really good! Even the presentation of my sandwich was lovely. I ordered an additional side of aioli preemptively but I really didn't need to, my meal was perfect. And I'd say the pricing is pretty good too. I've been to New Orleans several times... and such comparisons aren't really fair, but you can get a po boy twice the size for the same price there. That being said, I'm amazed by the taste and quality of the sea food considering the location of Idaho.  \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is super jazzy and fun. This would be a great place to bring a first date to kinda say, \"hey let's just loosen up and have a silly goose time, it's no worries. See! Look how slap-happy and fun this place is?!

Let's have some seafood!\"\n\nLastly I want to touch on the service of this place (that came out wrong). Our servers were amazing. Our waiter was great, the greeter was great, random people we talked to and asked about the restaurant were great. Two thumbs up. \n\nBut now I have to get to the reason I took away a star... I'm sorry; we were having so much fun. One of the servers walked by us and I could smell cigarette smoke. I'm highly allergic so it's easy for me to tell. If you're a manager, please please please don't throw the baby out with the bath water, maybe just make sure the staff keeps away from that sorta ordeal until work time is over. My dad and I loved each and every person we interacted with here, and we feel they're all deserving of praise. \n\nSo that's it that's what I got. New place to get some great food in Meridian! Hurray!",

  "text": "I don't really think this place deserves a five star rating unless your basing it on speed of service, price, and portion amount.  As far as taste goes, yes the wonton soup was delicious and so was the sesame chicken.  The Chicken Lo Mein was nothing to run their screaming for it was a little bland and I absolutely dislike their fried rice.  Yes it has pork in it, i know you don't get that in too many places, but it had absolutely no flavor what so ever.\n\nThe egg roll was ginormous, i mean seriously massive.  it was just okay, i would not get again, but it was big enough to almost fill me up alone.\n\nThe portions were huge! I think it could feed four easy off one plate, so beware.\n\nThey have the standard pictures you see at any eat in and takeout chinese strip mall place.  Take that picture and double the size that is what you get for $6.99, amazing deal.\n\ni do know they say they have 25 plates for lunch for 5.99 includes soup, egg roll and a soda, if you don't want a soda its only 4.99.  I'm assuming the portion size isn't much smaller than the dinner size according to the other reviews.\n\nAll in all i don't really think i will come back here, it isn't just my go to place.  I still have yet to find that place in the metroeast, the closest i have came for chinese is House of Hunan in ofallon and Sala Thai for thai food.",

  "text": "We decided to make Zeppoli our go to destination with a couple of friends the Sunday before Christmas and I have to say, I am glad we did. Yes, we did have reservations and no we did not need to wait for a table. We arrived right on time and were immediately seated. Zeppoli's is great because it is also a BYOB, so we sat down and were given wine glasses immediately. The menu is small and precise. Our server was wonderful and before ordering we were told that this is traditional Cicillian cuisine and not standard Italian fare. \n\nWe started out with the following apps: Panzanella Catania, Insalada Verde, and the Antipasto Siciliano. We were also given an order of Finocchi Salsiccia, Fennel Sausage, because they forgot to provide me with silverware. Both salads were good, citrusy and fresh. The anchovies that were on the Panzanella salad were ridiculously good and added a lightly salted note to the tomato and bread. The sausage was also delicious, it basically melted in your mouth and the rabe that was provided with the sausage gave it a great bitter element. But the star here was Antipasto. Good lord was that a good salad. I wish I could eat that dish every night. It was so wonderful. It has sharp provolone, marinated mushrooms, beans, salami, roasted red peppers and tomatoes and the list of awesomeness kept going. Probably the best Antipasto dish I have ever eaten.\n\nFor our Entrées the ladies each ordered the Taglietteli al Limone with prosciutto and I ordered the Taglietteli al Limone with bottarga as a small order and my buddy had the Pesto Trapanese. The Taglietteli was wonderful. It was like a flavor explosion in my mouth. Super citrusy and fresh and then you add in the bottarga and the dish just blew my mind because it went, citrusy, clean, fresh and oceany (Not sure if that is a word, but that is what it tasted like). Awesome dish! The pesto dish was ridiculous as well. My friend did let me try a bite; he was reluctant to do so. We also both had the Fisherman's Stew. It was good; the standout on this dish was the calamari. I guess that is how calamari is supposed to be cooked. It wasn't even close to rubbery, it was tender and basically melted in your mouth.\n\nWe did have room for desert and got the Zeppoli. They were wonderful, especially after you dipped them in the nutella. They came out fresh and hot. I definitely burned my mouth because I didn't want to wait to eat it.\n\nOverall this was one of my favorite meals in 2012. I would come back to Zeppoli's every week if I could afford it, alas I cannot. However, next time we are looking for somewhere good to go near Cherry Hill, Zeppoli's will certainly be in the forefront of my mind.",

  "text": "Lovely meal at a quaint restaurant, but I can't give this restaurant a full 5 stars.\n\nFirst off, the menu is a little limited, but that's because you're really leaving it up to the chef and whatever ingredients are freshest.  That's the concept, and the chef is very talented.\n\nThe space itself is a little small, so you can hear other people's conversations quite readily which became awkward for me near the beginning of our meal.\n\nI harmlessly asked if I could do another vegetable instead of potatoes with my striped bass, this confused my waiter (the look on his face was priceless), but then he went back to the kitchen asked about it, and I could hear everything they were saying.  This literally took about 8-10 minutes, and I was like I don't care.  They said not a problem, but then when I received my dish it had the potatoes anyway.  If I were an internet dude I'd use the SMH acronym here.  I just did.\n\nI don't want the newbie waiter's service to take away from the food, since that was outstanding.\n\nHere's what we did:\n\nWine -- BYOB!\n\nBread (3/5) -- I'm not a big bread guy, but this was more like a muffin and lacked sophistication.\n\nLeek Soup (4/5) -- Very good for a rainy evening.  A touch buttery, but not in a bad way.  There was a pea shoot garnish which I asked about to make conversation with the waiter; this turned into another \"everyone-in-the-restaurant-hears\" debate between the servers and the chef.  It was very good nonetheless\n\nKampachi (5/5) -- Easily the highlight for me.  It's seared (grilled?) on one side and raw on the other.  Sashimi-grade quality, and a good portion with just the right amount of sweet garnish with the dish\n\nStriped Bass (4/5) -- These guys know how to cook a fish.  Tender on the inside, just a touch of crispness on the outside.  Served with purple cauliflower, regular cauliflower, and...potatoes!  Light on the sauce, so I did not feel like a blob after eating.  A goodish 7-ounce portion of fish, I'd guesstimate\n\nI passed on dessert and did a coffee, which happened to be very good since they brewed it up fresh.\n\nCrowd seemed local and very pleasant.  The restaurant veered from warm to a touch chilly, so I'm not sure if they were having some heating issues.\n\ni'd definitely go again, but not banging down doors to get there.  Gut feeling is that this would be 5 stars with a more experienced waiter and during the warmer, summer months when the fruit of the earth is in full bloom.",

They give you a number and the beignets get delivered to you, so it wasn't like each customer was getting the beignets while ordering, not sure why the line was going so so slow. I think the cashiers are inefficient in that they also make the coffee orders so there's a lot of multitasking for one person. The customer behind me and I bonded over how slow the line was.\n\nLove though that Cafe Beignet has a resident live band though. That was a really nice NOLA touch. My family and I all really enjoyed the band. Plenty of seating too so that's nice, considering how popular this spot is. \n\nThe beignets were nice and fluffy. Not too oily. Lots of powdered sugar, def get a lot of napkins before sitting down! (3 beignets for $3.99) Also my family and I also went to Cafe Du Monde, and we weren't unanimous on which has better beignets so the verdict is still out. I'll go with Cafe Beignet, the beignets tasted fluffier and less oily to me here:)",

  "text": "This a local institution and a no-frills frozen custard shop that serves delicious frozen custard.  I liked what they offered and the prices were very reasonable.  I have had my fair share of good frozen custards so this wasn't anything mind blowing or such but it was on point regardless.  In my three visits to St. Louis, the third visit recently was the first time I went to Ted Drewes.  It was worth it.  I had two concretes.\n\nYou check out the menu on the side of the shop on a blackboard or you go up to the counter see the menu posting there.  The menu post by the ordering and pick-up counters is very hard to read.  It's not printed in a neatly organized way.  First, I ordered their 'Fox Treat' concrete - \"a concrete or sundae with hot fudge, raspberries and macadamia nuts.\"  I asked them to make it with their Abaco Mocha flavor.  It was da bomb.  I snarfed it down.  Then, I realized that I was already done with my concrete but craved more.  So I went up to the counter and ordered another concrete.  This time, I asked for their Lemon flavor with Blueberries.  It was pretty good.  On the second go, I slowed down a bit and savored it more...heheh...as I wasn't going to have it for the third time.\n\nI enjoyed my cups of their concretes.  You could taste the freshness of their vanilla custard and the mixed in ingredients. Again, it wasn't anything extraordinary or special as I have had same quality good ones elsewhere and Greg's in Mundelein, IL (to me) is a bit better but still a solid punch of good tasting frozen custard.  One thing I didn't like about their menu is that they only offer their regular vanilla flavor in a cone (and dipped in chocolate coating, if you want that) but otherwise, any added flavor kind is not served on a cone.  That's kinda a bummer.\n\nAnyway, I would recommend checking Ted Drewes out while in St. Louis.  They have two locations and this is their original one.",

I read so many reviews and saw the pics of them and must admit they looked incredible. I'm all for trying new things so I said \"What the heck!\" and OMG am I ever glad I did!! \nThese are some of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth!!! They have an incredible smokiness and are smothered in butter and parm cheese to make them out of this world!  After that I had the shrimp and grits w/ tasso ham which was also delicious. The tasso has quite a kick and along with the wonderfully tasty sauce and the dozen large shrimp, it made the grits a bit more tolerable (I found them to be bland and loose) At $22 it is a great deal for a larger portion than imagined.\nMy mom had the shrimp with angel hair pasta which was also a big portion w/ about the same amount of shrimp and that also was very, very good, I think it was about $19. \nWe were so full we had to pass on dessert but if I had room left, I would've ordered some more of thos oysters!",

And it was all fabulous. The steak was cooked perfectly (rare to medium-rare). The crab and lobster cake was rich, contained very little filler and sat in a tasty sauce of some type. The potatoes were well-peppered, so they didn't just look like a lump of white on the plate. The vegetables were well-seasoned. And I just love that tomato with its crispy outside and perfectly intact tomato.\n\nThe breadbasket at Brio is always inviting with the seeded flatbread triangles and sourdough bread, along with a plate of butter.\n\nPaul was outstanding with his check-ins to ensure all was going well. Waters were refilled any time they got to half-full. And he brought over the dessert offerings. We had to decline.\n\nI had hefty to-go vessels, including the remaining carpaccio, the bread and butter, and half of my meal.\n\nThis was stellar from beginning to end.",

They serve vegetarian fare and there's a sign on the door that says \"Tofu Rulz!\" I was sold at Tofu. They know what to do with those tasteless blocks of soy so that you don't miss meat for a millisecond. I ordered the surprise burrito, with tofu, rice, cheese, teriyaki, cilantro spicy salsa and sour cream. It was huge, and I was only going to eat half, but I couldn't ... stop ... myself. My lunch was delicious, and I'll be back to try other things on the menu. They unapologetically play rock loudly here. In fact, there's even a sign above the counter that says \"we don't take music requests. We like our rock and we like it loud.\" The service is efficient, if lacking a bit in personality. I found the servers were a bit stand-offish, like one might expect in too-cool-to-smile-at-you Toronto. And there's no debit, which is kind of annoying. But the food was excellent, and I'll go again.",

They have a huge buffet for them, so on big holidays I will feast out! \n\nTheir food is good! Caesar salad amazing! Love their crabcakes! Great fish tacos! Yummy warm bread and soft butter. \n\nThey are very pricey! Its an upscale type of restaurant so that is expected and it's on the water. However, I still come in my gym clothes and sit at the bar to eat, but honestly, I can careless about what I look like. I still pay the same price as everyone else. Still spend money! Plus I will stop in, eat at bar, and leave. So dont feel you have to be dressed up because its fine dinning. \n\nI give it 4 Stars because at Happy Hour time I will come in to eat food at Happy Hour prices. Well, the prices are cheaper on the crab-cakes but they are beyond small. They cut the portions way down with price too. I Still spent $40 when I just got salad, crab-cakes and 1 cocktail. And the serving sizes were small! \n\nIts also very different looking in there. Old and country like. I really dont know what else to call it. Just so you know, its not a hangout place at all. Just a dinner experience. Or they hold events there, think they are big for that. Its huge in there. Plenty of parking too! \n\nYou should try them out, just as long as you go in knowing what to expect. \n\nHope my review helps you!",

I consider myself a Jazzy type of guy, so this was up my alley. \n\nIt was made very clear during the reservation process that this was for a special occasion, a Birthday event to be more specific. Not sure that I expected anything much, but I hoped they would at least acknowledge it. The waitress must have mixed the reservation...who knows? But her acknowledgment was a \"happy anniversary\". smh!\nWhen you are getting ready to spend big dough, this becomes an issue. Its all in the details. Just ask the people at Commander's Palace.\n\nMoving on to the food. Its Tapas with the price tag of an upscale restaurant. Not sure I get all the fuss about this place. The food is not bad, but it is seriously overpriced. If you and your date want to leave on a full stomach, be ready to drop $100. It didn't make any sense.",

  "text": "I dig Three Muses, because it's close to the touristy French Quarter, but is so totally, refreshingly Marigny.  It, like the Uptown Delachaise, which I also visited on my most recent trip to the Crescent City, is a gastropub/winebar with small plates and a decent selection of wine and draft beers.\n\nBe advised that the plates are indeed quite small.  If you're starving, I'd say you could easily put away three of them yourself.  My friend and I had two each, plus dessert, and weren't super full when we left.  Seating is also limited and the seats by the door were absolutely freezing!  It was a warm evening in late November, but the doors were open and cold air was blowing on us.  Eventually we moved to the bar when two seats opened up there.\n\nYou order at the bar, which seems to somehow work better here than it did at Delachaise.  The food runner was sweet as pie!  There is an impressive vegetarian portion of the menu, of which we sampled the feta fries, falafel bites, housemade rigatoni, and miticana gratin, all of which were totally yum.  For dessert: chocolate heaven and banana-marscapon struedel.  I'm drooling over the memory of eating it.\n\nThe band playing was just freaking excellent.  I had a 9:00 Fringe Fest show to be at, so we missed most of their show, but what we saw / heard was super.\n\nI'd definitely visit again, next trip down south.",

The staff are friendly and although it's generally packed, everything is organized and smooth flowing.

We got there right at 11:30am the time they were supposed to open...There was no sign of life inside and there was 2 Asian dudes sitting at the front door waiting to get in as well.  So, I took a wild guess and asked them if they worked there, and they said YES....Lucky guess I suppose....I asked where the people were with the key and they said 5 mins away in a cab....Um okay, so 15 mins later a carload of chefs and waiters arrive and we go in....I was a little pissed, but figured no biggie, lets give this spot a try bc I saw all the great reviews and pictures on yelp.   \n\nWell I'm glad I DID!!!!   We get inside and the place was very clean and pretty cool looking....Our waiter was very attentive especially I think bc he was 1 of the dudes outside waiting with us, lol...However, they have a GREAT menu with a lot of options...I had some eel sushi which was very good and my buddy had some assortment platter thing...Now, the best thing though was the \"One night stand roll\" I ordered!!!!!   IT WAS FREAKING SLAMMING!!!!!!!!!!   It had salmon and tuna wrapped around spicy, crunchy crab!!!!!    NO RICE!!!!!!   Banging!!!!!    All the food was well worth all the BS I went through up till this point.   Also, the presentation of the food when it comes out is awesome too, make sure you have ur camera!!!!  I'd definitely go back, but I'd just give them a little more time to get to work  next time.  When we left it was around 12:30pm and the place was slammed too, so that's a good sign....",

The service is astounding and the food leaves you wanting more the minute you leave the restaurant.\n\nThe menu is divided into the traditional three courses - salad, appetizer, entree (of course, all of this is in proper Italian on the menu). While they recommend that you order one item from each section, you can do whatever pleases you. We ordered a variety of dishes and all were amazing. However, do yourself a favor and definitely order the gnocchi. It melted in my mouth and made me sad I had only ordered a half portion. \n\nEach course was paced nicely and the bread they give the table is to die for.

They have some beautiful fish dishes including a whole fish, some standard Mexican dishes such as enchiladas and tacos and some unusual items like fish and chips as a special or the steak with yucca fries or this chicken dish filled and covered with tons of flavor (not remembering the name). I've been here a dozen times and it's always good. Great margaritas too and a huge covered porch lined in fans. It's a relaxing space with a homey neighborhood feel.",

In other words, not for the calorie counter. But, just like everything else that's unhealthy for you, its delicious!",

  "text": "Was told by a few locals this is the spot for beignets.... it was eh... dough was too dense for my liking and a little bland. The iced cappuccino was weak. Service was good though.  The only thing I loved about this place was the outside seating. It was a perfect day with a light breeze. So we sat for a while and listen to a few guys play some music.",

  "text": "Cool place next to Cigar City Cedar & Mead in Ybor. Very quiet little tasting room on the corner of 15th and 8th. I stopped by with friends on a Saturday afternoon after hearing about the opening a while back and not yet having tried it! The bartenders were very welcoming and offered us many tastings from the menu. They also have started a moonshine collection with mainly spicy selections. The main vodka menu is large and I liked pretty much all of the samples I tried. While we did not end up buying a take home bottle that day, we tipped the staff and thanked them kindly for their hospitality. I think this place has tons of potential! Give it a try!",
