It was a great smoothie, however the prices are really high at $7.50. I've lived in many juice friendly cities that have organic fresh juices and smoothies and this is by far the most expensive place I've tried. I'm not sure my wallet can handle frequent visits but for a splurge once in awhile, I'll  definitely come back.",

She, Kevin, & ALL the servers were FANTABULOUS!! We had SOO much fun pickin appetizers & drinks & the place was just buzzin with HAPPY! The food was AWESOME, even tho we'd never had many things on the menu, like Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Yellow Beet salad, & Pate'! The stuff we were used to like raw/fried/baked oysters, & crisped french baguette sliced was PERFECT! Oyster ACTUALLY tasted like OYSTERS...even the FRIED ones (they & the raw ones are part of Happy Hour fare, along with half priced cocktails & wine)! I kno this is LONG but it's worth EVERY WORD! I'd recommend this place to EVERYONE, from locals to tourists! THANK U guys for makin us feel SOO at home!",

It was a long walk, and a cold and dark January night, but the hair on the back of my neck stood up nearly the whole time.  The tour guide was very entertaining and knowledgeable about the stories.  We even stopped off for a cocktail to warm up and take a quick break.  It was the highlight of my trip to NOLA and I was so happy to have stumbled up it.",

  "text": "No, no, no, no.....just no. My friend and I ordered the fried oysters, seafood gumbo, crawfish pasta and the soft-shelled crab to share. We ate as much as we could, left the restaurant full and satisfied, but then spent the rest of the night sick. Very sick. Like stay-in-the-bathroom-for-hours sick. I am afraid that every time I think about fried seafood, I'll remember this experience and then promptly throw up. \n\nOther than the raging sickness that descended on our trip, the restaurant was just OK. Service was friendly but awkward (why did we have three servers?) and the food was good but nothing special. We certainly had better gumbo and seafood at other points in our trip (this was a pre-food poisoning opinion).",

Regardless, my latest visit is my last visit to Panda Express, if I can help it.\nI recently went to their newly opened restaurant on 96th St in the Meijer parking lot...I wasted my money, again.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken pao, and broccoli beef. They both tasted like soap. Honestly, this is the worst chinese food I have ever tasted. I threw most of it away. You only get two entrees and rice for almost $7. I can go to another chinese restaurant and get that along with a side and drink for that price.  In addition, I have determined that Panda Express tastes like plain, make-at-home chinese. In fact, I think I could do better than this. At least I have finally learned my lesson and know for sure that their food will never be improved. I am just really surprised that they get enough business to need to open another location.",

  "text": "On Friday night, I finally got around to trying out Virago in Lansdale for dinner and, more importantly, dessert. Husband and I split the vegan \"beef\" cheesesteak wrap. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'm dying to try the vegan buffalo chicken wrap. Virago offers a choice of whole wheat or gluten free wraps for any of their sandwiches. This place seems to be all about the gluten free options, with a few great vegan options thrown in the mix too.\n\nThe vegan cheesesteak was tasty, full of very mild, fried onions and peppers and a good amount of tasty Daiya cheese. If I had been more hungry, it would have been the perfect amount for a filling dinner. But I wasn't starving and I had to save room for an assortment of dessert. Our dessert was 100% vegan, as well; we split two cupcakes and a pastry. The pastry was a nut bar with caramel and chocolate chips, and it was delightful. The usual pecans were on top, but there were also some hazelnuts in there which was a delicious touch. The cupcakes, coconut chai and coffee chocolate chip, were just okay. The cake itself was a little crumbly and the frosting was a little overpowering. I will return because there are very few places in the burbs with vegan options and there are still a number of vegan options on Virago's menu that I have yet to try!",

I noticed it soon as I walked in on a Saturday late afternoon. I headed in the direction of the small performance space which included a stage, table & chairs. The young dude was singing an Adele tune so beautifully & effortlessly. His original tunes were even more incredible. A gifted word smith. I'm still kicking myself I didn't buy his CD.

It's not so frou-frou that a guy feels self-conscious, but rather the manly type of place that makes you feel like your Don Draper. They do all sorts of cuts and are incredibly great at them, while still pricing things reasonably. For those going to Great Clips or Sport Clips, price-wise, it won't be much of a increase  while the quality and experience will be far far better.\n\nThey also do straight-razor shaves, and have a variety of hair products that are pretty excellent.\n\nIn short: Uncle Classic Barbershop is where men go to get their hair cut when they've grown up.",

  "text": "I'm originally from Atlanta, GA and have eaten at Longhorn Steakhouses for years.  I was very excited when I found out that one was opening in Tucson even though it is 45 minutes from where I live.\n\nSo today I decided to try it out.  I went by myself for a late lunch (around 1:30).  Walked in a was immediately greeted but had to wait a few minutes because I didn't want to sit at the bar.  My server, Amanda, came over and asked for my drink order and I ordered water with extra lemon.  She brought it back shortly but with only one lemon slice and quickly disappeared before I could say anything.  A little later she came back for my food order and when I gave that to her I again asked for extra lemons. \n\nThen I went to the restroom and when I came back by table had been cleared - no water or silverware and wiped down.  Someone who worked there was near by and I told her that my table had been cleared.  She apologized and told me that my water was \"right here\".  Right here was a large, round table full of dirty glasses and silverware.  I just looked at her and she said \"I'll go get you a new water\".  While she was gone to get the water a hostess came up and asked me \"did someone seat you here?\".  I explained what happened and she said she just wanted to be sure since I didn't have a menu. \n\nWhen Amanda brought my salad to me I had to remind her (3rd time) that I was still waiting for my extra lemons.  Finally got them. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food 3 people were seated in the booth next to me.  They had to wait for a server and when one finally came over to them they had questions.  The customers wanted to know about a sauce (not sure which one), the waiter starts to tell them what was in a sandwich.  When the customer said he wanted to know what was in the sauce and not the sandwich the waiter gave him a look of disgust and said \"I'm telling you all I know\",  looked at them again and then said \"I'll be back to take your order\" and walked off.  Amanda went to them sometime later and said that she would be their server because he became busy.  One of the other diners stated that she thought they might have scared him off and that he was snarly with them.  Amanda looked at them and said \"you're not going to run me off, are you?\"  I didn't think the either server was very nice to those diners.\n\nBack to me, once my food arrived the fries were limp, very brown and lukewarm.  Flo's filet came out fine.  I ate my food and I think Amanda only checked back with me once.  Someone else (manager maybe, she didn't identify herself) came to clear the table and asked if I wanted a box for the fires that weren't good.  I told her no and that they weren't very good.  She apologized and asked if I'd like another side.  Hello - I'm through with my meal, offer me a desert or something but not another side.  Received the check shortly afterwards, paid and left.  BTW, the table with the dirty glasses and silverware that was next to me was dirty the whole time I was there.  There were two couples waiting to be seated even though there were empty tables.  I may give this Longhorn another try but more likely than not I'll go to Lil' Abners.",

If this company isn't a scam, it sure conducts business as if it were a scam.  \nI purchased travel insurance from this company when my son was studying in China.

I was told that the review was in process and should be done within a week.  So, I am waiting again\nAfter two weeks with no word I call back and then was told that my claim hadn't been looked at yet.  The customer service rep found it and says, \"Well, this documentation is in Chinese.  We'll have to get this translated before we can look at it.\"  And I remind him that he works for an International Travel Insurance company, which means that there's a good chance supporting documentation will be in another language.  (So, if I hadn't called my claim would still be sitting in a pending pile.  This is about 2 and a half months after I submitted it.)\nSo, the claim is sent to translation and processed and about 4 weeks later I get a letter in the mail denying my claim in total.  The reason given was that it was a \"Pre-existing Condition\".  This was a one-time stomach virus.\nI sent in an appeal to this decision and waited....\nFour weeks goes by with no response.  So I called today to see where it's at and am told that no one has even looked at it.  The CSR tells me that she's going to expedite the appeal and will get back to me in a week or so.

Never EVER, in a million-billion years, did I ever think that I could find Spanish cuisine that came anywhere close here in the States. Chez Garces certainly proved me wrong. \n\nGarces is Spanish, so these are true Spanish tapas -- very few Latin American twists to the traditional recipes. You'll find tapas and wine from all regions in Spain -- of which I sampled on my last visit to Amada. Tapas from Catalan, Segovia, Toledo, Madrid and wonderful wines from each region to compliment every bite. \n\nEvery detail of your meal is thought out -- right down to the sparkling water...

Definitely the best steak on the menu! It was cooked to perfection- so melt-in-your-mouth delicious! It was my boyfriend's birthday and they accomodated my special request for amazing seating and also brought out a candle and ice cream to add to the \"special\" feeling. However, this place makes you feel special the second you walk in. Definitely has the old Hollywood atmosphere going on- very fun-fancy, very classy!",

  "text": "I wouldn't have normally eaten here, but was with a family member who wanted to give it a try. I finally decided to go in and see what it was about. First, the prices are crazy expensive. $11 for a 2 piece meal?!? Plus, they won't let you buy additional pieces of chicken a la carte. With that said, the food came out very hot. I personally thought my chicken could have been fried longer AND it was too greasy. The biscuits are amazing though. I doubt I'll ever return because the chicken is soooo much better at Gus's Fried Chicken.",

So when I happened to see this place as we were walking, I just knew we had to try it out!\n\nWe ended up eating here for dinner the next night, and I was so happy with our decision! They had so many options for toppings on their delicious classic mac recipe. I ended up deciding on the crabby mac, and my husband chose the basil chicken pesto. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be ready, and we sat down in the restaurant because all of the outdoor seating was taken. We absolutely loved our meal! It was so filling that I had to take some of it back to our hotel with us. Next time we go back to Philadelphia for a visit, coming back to this place is going to be a priority on our list of things to do!",

  "text": "I had high hopes for this spot because I looooove middle eastern food. Unfortunately, it wasn't the outstanding experience I imagined it would be. Went with my work team so started off with a few apps - whipped feta, hummus and bacon wrapped dates. The table loved the whipped feta the best I would say. The hummus had great texture but tasted a little too lemony to be my favorite. The chickpeas however gave it a nice crunch. I also appreciate cucumbers along with the pita. For my personal meal I had the turkey sandwich. I had hoped for a little spice with the banana pepper vinaigrette, but alas the aioli overpowered the boring sandwich. The people who got the lamb sandwich loved it so that may be the way to go. The bahn bee had very hard bread and was greasy. The worst though were the sides. The fries were so hard that they were more like the potato stick snacks I recall as a kid. The vegetable salad side was too sweet with a weird sauce that no one enjoyed. All and all I doubt I would give it another try even though service was great and the atmosphere is cute. The food needs to step up the game!",

The grocery part of the store is much less populated, and very expensive. But quite clean and organized! The one gripe I have about this place is the check out line. The place is always packed with people trying to buy lunch yet they seem to only have two check out lanes open. There's also no conveyor belt on which to set your groceries which congests the store even further. Lines form and people get agitated. This is enough of a reason for me to dread stopping in here when I have to pick something up quick!",

  "text": "It was a Monday after the first Eagles tailgate and lets just say I was feeling a little rough. One of my coworkers recognized my mental state at the time and referred me to City Hydration. To be honest, I was both skeptical and nervous about IV therapy but hey I was hungover and willing to try it out. \n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside City Hydration, all my anxiety and skepticism was put to ease when Christie introduced herself, told me to recline in a comfortable chair, gave me a water and offered a blanket. She knew I was on a tight schedule and with the utmost efficiency she started the hydration process. There was no pain, there was no feeling of coldness, it was a tranquil experience that took no more than 30 minutes. After the process was complete, I stood up and almost immediately recognized that my nauseousness and dizziness was subdued. Christie did state that it could take an hour or two to realize the full results. I'd have to agree with her statement, within a couple hours I was my normal functional self again. I think for anyone who is skeptical, City Hydration is the perfect place to try IV therapy. I would highly recommend it and will go back to try the other IV options. Thanks again Christie you're the best!",

The macarons are neatly displayed like jewelry in their case. There are so many varieties of flavors, but I ultimately ended up with the Coconut. It was delicious. Nice crunch on the outside and then soft as you bite down. And lots of flavor. The four stars is merely because I have had very few macarons in my day so not sure if it's the best one I've had yet or not. But so far it is!\n\nThey also have Norman Love chocolates...one of the best chocolatiers in the area. I tried a hazelnut truffle and it was truly heavenly.\n\nThey have gelato as well, but I was too distracted by the macarons and chocolates to give that case a look. \n\nThe guy who waited on us was also very nice...and French! Thinking he may have been the owner, or at least a manager.\n\nCan't wait to go again!",

  "text": "After running into stumbling blocks with other lenders -- including a nationally-acclaimed lender marketed specifically toward veterans -- my most excellent real estate agent (see his review elsewhere) recommended Jason Griesser and his team at Prospect Mortgage. My situation was somewhat unique and more difficult than usual, but not only did they work with me to qualify for the mortgage I needed (where the other lenders fell short), they were also extremely helpful every step of the way through closing. They made the entire process seem nearly effortless, including all of the extra steps required of a VA loan. In addition, I ended up with a slightly lower interest rate than I was originally expecting, as well as some unexpected cash back at closing. They were supportive and helpful during every step of the process, always answering any questions I had, and were never condescending or obstructive in any way. Settlement was never in jeopardy of being pushed back because of mortgage delays, and I closed in far less time than I had expected at the outset. Based on this extremely positive experience, I would gladly recommend Jason and his team to anyone looking to purchase a home or refinance.",

With L/T on a rugged multigrain bread, it's hands down the best egg salad I've ever had. They have a nice style with every food item, nothing is taken for granted, just as they didn't do a routine egg salad. Yes, comes with the horse radishy potato salad, yum. Excellent coffee, semi-friendly baristas - what more could you want? As mentioned, I particularly like their potato salad, check it out, it comes with sandwiches but I believe you can also order it as a separate side order. Outdoor seating is a plus. Wifi and warm, quiet atmosphere (despite the many young kids that are brought in) make it not a bad place to get a little work done as well.",

I'm fairly autonomous when working on creative projects, but Board & Brush really has a great balance of when to step in and help someone find their way, and when to just let folks get their art on. They're also full of helpful painting tips and techniques to help you create what you're going for.\n\nWhat was also cool about this event was that I didn't even know anyone there, but we were all singing and jamming along together as we worked on our signs. All the finished signs I saw turned out really cute, and everyone seemed to be happy with their final product. Thank you Yelp Reno and Board & Brush for a fantabulous evening!

  "text": "Slightly better now with the new owners.  The lady at the register with the green/blue hair is the only polite one who works there. Everyone else needs to be trained/taught how to deal with the public. The health and beauty department is always about 90 degrees fahrenheit and I doubt that helps keep the products from spoiling/melting.\n\nThe last time I ate there, I was eating, when I suddenly heard the sound of nails being clipped. I looked over, and yep, the lady working at the cafe was standing right by the food trays, clipping her nails. When I told the owner bout it, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away to go back to stocking shelves. \n\nThe cafe serves up flavorless slop and I cannot believe I gave it the benefit of the doubt on three occasions. I could not even eat most of it. (you are better off eating at Soy Cafe) The prepared food in the refrigerated section is okay, a hit or miss. I keep asking them where they moved their 'Awesome foods' brand items and they keep pointing at other foods that are clearly not the same brand. I tried the other brands and they are not as good as the Awesome Foods brand. I guess they no longer carry them. \n\nThe juice bar attendants act as though I am torturing them when I place an order. No worries, there are LOTS of other juice bars in Philly, yes, even in my neighborhood (fish town)\n\nOverall, their prices on most items are too high and I suspect that their employees are paid a low wage. I often see products on the shelves that are about to expire the next day and there is no discount on them. All of this is a recipe for going out of business.\nI still go there to buy certain items, but do most of my shopping elsewhere.\n\nPenn Herb Company is MUCH better, so is Whole Foods and several others.",

The outdoor seating was very beautiful and the overall ambiance of the place was hip and cool but also homey at the same time. The food was really really good. The bacon is more of a short rib and it was a highlight of my meal. Another thing that blew me out of the water was the biscuits. Wowza. Best biscuits ever. Period. \nThe only reason I am not giving it a 5 was because of the unwillingness to take out a nonessential ingredient due to an allergy. The waffle is topped with pistachio butter, which I am allergic to, and when I asked for it on the side or not to be added they said they couldn't do it. I don't get why not. That was about the only disappointment.",

I'd hate to think that this was the cause for the poor service..  The server dropped off the food and only came back if we flagged her down.  Miraculously once the forks hit the plates, to indicate we were done our meal, she ran up with the checks. We asked for boxes for the remaining food.. she ran off before we could ask for refills for our drinks.  Came back with ONE box and no bag.  We flag her down for the drinks. \"Do you want those to go?\"  First  time she actually asked us something since the food hit the table...  no,'how is your food?' No,\"would you like anything else?' No, \"Would you like a dessert?\"  We ordered dessert....after we flagged her down again.  Same \"Do you want the to go?\"  My friend finally asked, \"Do we have to leave?\"  I mean damn!\n\nOkay so then the server did not create a new check as we asked and just added it to one of the gentleman's checks.. we asked her to fix it.  She didn't. We go to pay and the gentleman was over charged.  The General Manger was called to try to fix the error and had a disgusted tone to his voice... and he turned out to not ask questions either... hmmm..  Crappy service and the quality of the food no longer supports the prices...  I'm truly disappointed since I used to enjoy this place.",

Now onto the rib eyes that had plenty of flavor and nice color.  If dining together, I suggest each person getting a different side as they don't do family style.  I asked for a wine recommendation to pair with the rib eye, expecting it would be the most expensive selection.. haha, the server suggested the zin.  It was fabulous.  We are generally 50/50 on having desert but based on the recommendation of the bread pudding we indulged.  Well worth the extra calories! The service was excellent and friendly.",

I showed up to the bus station about 45 minutes early for my 3:30am bus so I wouldn't miss it if they tried to leave early. They show up 45 minutes late to the terminal. I tried asking around the terminal to see if anyone knew the status of this bus, but there was not one rep for megabus present at all. I tried giving customer service a call but nothing the entire 45 minutes until the bus came. Freaking out because I have a set engagement to get to, I tried buying a ticket with greyhound instead around 4:10, WHO IS MUCH MORE RELIABLE HERE BTW, but ended up getting a refund for that because that's when the megabus showed up 5 minutes later. Finally getting on the bus and the bus driver was just rude and very short on words when I was asking him questions about my baggage and boarding. Now getting into the bus, it smells like this thing hasn't been cleaned in the past year. Please save yourself the headache and just fly, drive, or take the Amtrak.",

My husband and I, taking advantage of their happy hour, ordered their nachos. We've had them before and they are yummy. But tonight, instead of cubed moist chicken they gave us soggy, shredded, crock-pot like chicken. Also, the nachos are supposed to come with beans. I counted the beans.......there were 7 total beans (I sent it back asking for more beans and my plate came back with MAYBE 12 beans). Flavor was lacking. My son ordered the corn dog pops. He loves their cheddar-IPA sauce. Our server did not tell us that the restaurant no longer made this sauce (despite us requesting two sides of it), and instead brought two sides of spicy mustard sauce (he's a little kid! What was the thinking there??). I have one other complaint that I have felt for awhile, that being that the service is T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E. Don't go in there expecting to get your drinks in a timely manner. You are lucky if you get them before your meal. And even more lucky if a server comes up to you to take your order at all.",

At least offer a whole for $20, I'd pay that for it.  My second trip was for a Burger, because when I was there the first time, the burgers did look fantastic.

We ordered takeout as we were crunched for time.\n\nThe food:\nTwo delicious chicken pita sandwiches filled to the brim with very flavorful chicken and salad with large tomatoes, pickles, and delicious sauce.\nIt was truly mouthwatering and the sandwiches are huge, we split one and were so full. Seriously do yourself a favor and order this. So so good even the pita tasted amazing.\n\nIn addition we ordered 2 orders of falafel- each order comes with 2 large falafel- so much flavor and I could not stopped dipping them in the homemade yogurt sauce.\n\nThis place is the real deal and the prices are extremely reasonable for how much food you receive.\nIn addition, the employees are very professional and friendly. I cannot wait to try other options on their menu :)",

(The huge star in the middle of the menu can be quite distracting!). If you need a good sushi lunch place, then get the lunch special. They have an awesome deal at 3 rolls for $12, which includes either soup or salad. Guess how many choices of rolls you get to choose from? 43!!! Lots of choices to choose from, and I really digged the Pepper Tuna roll and the Alaskan roll. I had the crabmeat apple roll, but didn't care much for it.\n\nMore reasons to love this place: Service is fast and friendly, and they have LOW-sodium soy sauce. \n\nMy challenge is to try different rolls/dishes each time I go there, except the California roll. :)",

  "text": "Can I give them 10 stars please? They exceeded expectations in the two main points that count, price and customer service. We bought a GE stove there. Price: they matched the sale price of a big box store nearby, even though the big box store didn't even have that model in stock. Both big box stores couldn't even get one for weeks; Mark's got theirs in within 2 days. In terms of customer service -- all I can say is wow and I'll never go anywhere else for an appliance. First, our stove died just before a houseful of people showed up for the holidays. Big store: \"sucks to be you.\" Mark's: \"We will move heaven and earth, reschedule some deliveries that aren't time critical, and make sure we get it to you.\" THEN...the original one I ordered didn't fit the space. Seriously? With a big box store I would be SOL; Mark's ordered another that, on paper, was the same size, but the cooktop was configured a little differently, and voila, it fit. They didn't charge for ordering, trying to fit one, taking it back, then redelivering another one. Can you imagine the nightmare that would have been with the big box store? I offered to pay for the extra delivery and they said, naw... Last: it's now 9 months later. Fan sounds a little loud to me, not sure it's an issue, but could they check it out? Sure.... no problem... they'll come by to assess. There is no way on earth someone from the big box would just \"run by\" when they can, and even if they did I'd wonder if they were sending someone knowledgeable. I'm just floored by their great customer service and product knowledge, and would highly encourage anyone in the area to try them before ordering elsewhere. Just completely superior.",

I cannot believe I have yet to write a review for it.\n\nThey have PLENTY of big tables (and lots of little ones) in the big main room and also some additional seating in a smaller adjoining room. The back patio is a nice place to hang if you don't need an outlet. The staff is super friendly and do a great job with any order!\n\nThe drinks are pretty good - my favorite being a vanilla dirty chai with almond milk. They also have a bottomless cup of coffee deal for $3 - perfect for an all hours study binge! The food is decent - nothing fancy, but it's fresh and they have gluten-free bread that they'll substitute for any bagel. I like the Rox out with your Lox Out (open face) sandwich and the Garden Griller, but I mostly just eat here when I'm pulling a long study session and don't want to go home in the middle. \n\nThe music they play is pretty chill and usually my style, but you can easily put on headphones if you're feeling something else. \n\nIt can get crowded sometimes and harder to find a big table, but something usually frees up eventually!\n\nI would recommend it for studying, grabbing a coffee with a friend, or even a first date (I've eavesdropped on a some hilarious blind dates here).",

After the more than courteous server Jordan inquired several times, my wife said it was her mistake and no problem. Minutes later, the manager Jessica arrived with an order of cheese fries. How unexpected and customer service oriented. Great gesture Jessica. You just earned a customer that usually goes to the Fishhawk location which is about the same distance. I had the Mouth watering Victoria filet and broiled lobster tail with a side baked potato and Caesar salad. All were cooked to perfection and would highly recommend. Happy hour till 7pm  is nice and the IPA on tap was earthy without a bitter after taste. The strawberry shortcake was scrumptious.

  "text": "Greek restaurant on the south side of Edmonton.  Nice decore feels like one of the restaurants we went to in Santorini. Low ceilings with Vines across the ceiling.  Food is expensive.  No bread or anything to munch on while waiting for your food unfortunately.  Drinks pricy. Individual lamb skewers were bland at $12 each!  Large portions for pistacho but not up to fine dining standards for $25. Many entrees were $35.   I found the wood chairs very uncomfortable with little padding.  I am slim but they didn't fit my derrière.  Nice outdoor patio.  Staff were very attentive and very polite.",

  "text": "I actually had to come here twice in order to their delicious shrimp poboys. The first time was around 11:30pm on a Saturday night, but they had ran out of bread for the night. We decided to try again the next day for lunch and was able to order a shrimp poboy.\n\nIt took them about 20-30 minutes to make 10 orders of shrimp poboys, but that meant it was a perfect time to grab a frozen irish coffee from the bar. \n\nThe shrimp poboys reminded me of vietnamese sandwiches. Same type of bread with lots of veggies, but the key ingredient is the fresh shrimp. Every time I've had shrimp poboys, the shrimp has always been fried, but this time I was pleasantly surprised to see the shrimp without batter. \n\nThe sandwich was quite delicious although quite expensive at $14.",

I rarely shop here because the store is gross, old and there is NEVER anyone to help you if you have a question. They need a facelift and new employees and lower prices and I think they will succeed. My wife and I went in to get some drapes for the new house. (I know, why K-mart) eel they do sell Martha Stuart Home items and she thought that they would have a better selection that the other store (Which they did). \n\nHowever the prices were out of this world! I mean for a store that is near death, for them to ask that much on a non designer item is terrible. We didn't get anything there, and unless I am needing something that I can not find at the other chains or they are having a huge sale, I don't think I'll be back. I hate to give a place 1 star unless someone was rude or I have have a bad experience more than once, so I will give them 2. (For Now??)",

Angelo and Andy were fantastic, and did a very thorough job.

  "text": "Hilton advertises trail rides at this resort. The trail rides were run by Pot a Gold adventures. More like Pot o Crap. \nWe were charged $80 per person for a sunset trail ride. When we arrived as instructed at 4pm there  was only one woman there , she had her retainer out on the table, was eating pizza, and had a pack of cigarettes next to her food, and the staff for the ride wasn't even there yet. We waited almost 20 minutes.\nThe smell was overwhelming. The horses were filthy, to be honest. They were caked with dirt and feces and their manes were matted. \nOur ride started at 4:40 and ended at 5:15. The sun was directly overhead and it was no where close to sunset. So, basically were charged for an hour sunset ride that was about 35 minutes and not at sunset.the \"sunset\" ride was $20 more PER PERSON than the one hour trail ride. The manager I emailed said they can't have the horses out at sunset because they get spooked and also because they need to eat. Ummmm, fine, but then don't call it a sunset ride and charge more for it. They refused to refund the extra money they charged for the \"sunset\" ride, and were very rude about it. \nThe horses were not well behaved and my husbands horse just walked off the trail to go back to the stable , the guide said he wanted to eat. The \"trail\", by the way, is a patch of grass and cacti next to the highway. It was awful. Not at all what was advertised. Will be reporting to BBB for false advertising by Hilton and Pot a Gold adventures.",

She's new to the practice (went to school at Vandy then moved for work and is back in Nashville) so she had good availability. I called Friday for an appt and got in Wednesday. \n\nThe reason for not giving 5 stars is 2 fold. The front office staff is not professional, welcoming or informative. Didn't even stop their conversation to greet me when I checked in. I used to do their job for a living so was disappointed to find yet another medical office with cold, uncaring staff. The other reason was the wait time. No one came to say \"Sorry for the wait, she'll be with you soon.\" Not a word and I didn't see the dr until an hr after my appt time. That's one of my pet peeves. Everyone knows Drs run late, but what happened to decency. If you're running more than 15-30min late have the courtesy and let you patients know. Thankfully I wasn't on a babysitter time limit today like I was going to be. I would still recommend the office because the Dr makes up for the rest. She's awesome!",

The third time I left with crooked ends and green tinted highlights and lots of breakage. When I called to have it fixed, Grace, who by the way is really nice, said Katie wouldn't get on the phone with me but it was beigey blond when I left so I must have done something to it.  Yeah, because I want my hair to look like green hay so I messed with it.  And Guess what?  Helen Keller and Stevie wonder both stopped me when I left  the salon and asked me why my hair was green. Anyway, she said I can come in for a clarifying shampoo and conditioner.  Yeah, I can go to CVS and do that myself.  I informed the very pleasant Grace to tell Katie not only did she lose me as a client but my friend who was horrified for me as well. I just went somewhere else at my expense to repair the damage as best I could. I did receive a call from the owner, who also was extremely nice, but by that point I didn't feel comfortable going back, which is a shame because all the other stylists' customers left that day with gorgeous locks. So one star for each good experience. The quest continues!!",

The patience, determination and sheer professionalism that Gabe from Mr. Electric exhibited was more than impressive. He wasn't satisfied that it was our panel being the problem (most others just said I needed a new panel), but narrowed it down to the EPCOR power supply. EPCOR had been out once and declared the power stable. He got them out again, and together they found a bad (arcing) line in the roadside cabinet. Problem found, and resolved. I cannot say enough about the service this company provided to us over the festive season. I can say that I would recommend them to anyone without reservation. They are an outstanding example of great service.",

It's great for takeout, or hang out in the trendy restaurant! Make sure you stir it up more than you think you need to! And keep sipping that miso soup! It's such an amazing combination. And because there are so many options and combinations, the revisit value for this place is high. Vegan, vegetarian, and kosher people can eat here and have a great time with their friends without judgement!",

Once my table was ready, I was told to walk across the room to the stairway and walk up a flight of stairs to be greeted by another hostess that would show me to my table.  The table they offered me was in the corner away from the live entertainment that was playing on the main stage downstairs.  I denied their table and found a spot at the bar on the same level that was not crowded.  I ordered a drink and sat back to relax to the sound of the band playing cover songs.  I thought the red tractor hanging upside down added a neat touch to the atmosphere inside the bar.  The drink I ordered was smooth and easy.  I just wished the band would have mixed it up with their own songs along with singing cover songs.",

It doesn't have a sign and the area is pretty scary. The restaurant is located underneath a Mexican store. Be on a lookout for the yellow building. Walking in my first thought was this is a hipster fusion Asian restaurant. Staff are very friendly and laid back. Upon ordering I read other reviews about the general Tso chicken so I got that. Also the ginger noodles, craw rangoons and Hawaiian fried rice. The craw rangoons are delicious but the only problem is there's not enough filling. They cut their rangoons in half making the cream cheese filling melt out but the spicy green salsa condiment on the plates makes the dish taste amazing. Next the ginger noodles. The serve it with a gigantic spoon... This dish was my least favorite. It's was bland. I didn't not like it. Do not get it if you want to waste $12. General Tso chicken was pretty good. It's not your regular chopped up chicken. They serve you a breast, thigh, wing and drums. Best Tso chicken I ever had. It was a bit overcooked but tasted good still. I would recommend subbing the breast for thighs. Now my favorite dish is the Hawaiian fried curry rice. This dish is f***ing amazing. The pineapples were sweet, the bacon made the rice smokey, the curry was just awesome and I love how they had just a little bit of vegetables in the dish. Overall I would recommend this restaurant",

At the end of the day, how can you beat great food at good price? The owner is very friendly and I love her risk taking entrepreneurial spirit and story. She also provides free wifi. I hope this place can eventually become those places where you can come in with your laptop and work for half an hour with a cup of great coffee. P.S.

When you walk in you see a wall of cheesecake and you pretty much know it is going to be a fun experience. We were fortunately seated near the HDTV at the back of the restaurant as we watched the Jets fail their faces off against the Steelers - that part sucked, but even that sucking moment was still fun since we were hanging out at the diner. We were in a big group and we also were sitting right next to another big group, the Duke University fencing team. This place draws big groups in because it has a legit reputation among everyone, locals and those from far away who had a great meal here once a long long time ago.\n\nThe big guy (4u) waiter right off the bat was friendly, gracious, and funny - top notch staff here for sure. The water was not exactly refilled at a regular pace but I guess it was pretty busy. It was really hard to choose a dinner since everything sounded so good. I finally settled on the open faced Monte Cristo, longing for 'ye olden days when that deliciousness of the Monte Cristo used to be available at Bennigan's before their shenanigans shuttered their doors across the country. Penrose does not make 'yo daddy's Monte Cristo and that is not an entirely bad thing.\n\nThis is french toast as the base, two pieces and very moist and eggy. Not fried like Bennigan's. Just french toast that is AWESOME. Then meat piled on top of the french toast. Then some cheese on top of that. And a big helping of fries. The fries were solid, the good diner kind, not the shoe string or crinkle cut or that other junk places try to pass off.\n\nI will be back for more Penrose.",

We met the owners and everyone was so helpful and accommodating. Their suggestions for sauce choices were on point. Food were delicious and fresh. \n\nSecond visit was ok. This time my salad tasted dirty, as if it wasn't washed and prepped before serving. I did saw the guy open a bag and dumped it in. I'm sure a lot of businesses do this as well but maybe we just had a bad batch? I don't know. It threw off my entire meal. I ended up having to pick around it.\n\nThird visit was better. I wish I remembered which combination of sauces I created the first time. Pretty sure I've tried every sauce they offer. \n\nOverall, nice place. Clean setting and bright, open space. You can either build your own bowl or choose one of their specialties. Love the freshness of the seafood. So far the best poke we've had in the city.",

While in the beginning the bartenders were nice and personable, toward the end of the night they got rude and played favorites. On New Year's Eve usually people have fun, drink and get a bit loud- I don't think they really accepted that here. While those around us were making noise on noise makers and yelling all in good fun, an old fossil like woman with a not so good look ( to say the least) turned and yelled at patrons to be quiet and \" even the bartenders are annoyed with your loud behavior\". The bartenders said not a word and continued to tend to their favorites.  It was uncalled for and very discouraging to watch. It's a shame because of this we were appalled and would never return.

Needless to say, I will never go back and talked to the manager twice and all he could do was make excuses for the terrible service we got. Our \"party planner\" (I won't name her on here)was completely checked out, sat in the dark room ( not with the kids) playing on her phone. Thankfully my friends were there to serve the kids drinks and pizza. We paid for laser tag, ball blasters and black light mini golf. The laser tag was broken, one ball blaster wasn't working so one kid had to sit and watch and we never got to play mini golf. We had no clue what was going on or what activity was next as our party planner was no where to be found. We talked to the manager and he gave each kids ( there were 8) tokens to play arcade games... ha! What a joke. The games were broken and just took their tokens or didn't spit out the tickets. I called the manager today and he told me she is his best girl and something must be wrong. It's sad if that is his best girl. He told me to call him and he will let my kids play golf anytime on him. I said no thank you, we will not be returning. What really pissed me off was having to leave a $25 to a girl who played on her phone. I should have tipped my friends. I will never go back again.",

  "text": "I decided to try out guitar lessons because I've always envied the fun my brother and uncle have playing guitar. Also, with a little one on the way any day now, I think it's important for kids to grow up with, and around, music. Even though I had played other instruments fairly proficiently in the past, I knew that with something like the guitar, I could save myself a lot of frustration, bad habits, and time by getting lessons from a professional. And that's where Kale comes in! I've enjoyed and learned from each lesson from day one. I like the pacing and combination of music theory, technical lessons, and the opportunities to play along. My confidence and ability, even though still quite nascent, are far beyond what I could have accomplished on my own by watching YouTube videos or that kind of thing. When my husband hears me practice, which he admits to enjoy, he's impressed that he can recognize songs or notice improvement in such a short time. I'm very appreciative of Kale and the careful attention he has applied to my playing and lessons.",

  "text": "My favorite day of the year is Labor Day, when I attend the Reno Rib Cook-Off. This year we actually were there the day before Labor Day. It was a little bit more crowded at the event but the drive back to the Bay Area was much faster than doing it on the holiday.\n\nParking is generally very easy. It can take a minute, but there are several locations that are closeby, if you're patient. The streets are closed for the event and lots of stands to choose from, selling ribs and roasted corn, or other fried, delicious foods. \n\nSampler plates (3 ribs) are about $7 - though this year we saw one as high as $9 (and it wasn't very good). and one that gave us 4 ribs for $7 (from Memphis.... served dry, without sauce - they were the BEST ever!!!)\n\nTwo restaurants local to our home make it to the Cook-Off every year: Kinders and Back Forty Texas Barbecue. Both are really good but obviously I am not going to stand in line to try them at the cook off when I can get them at home.\n\nLots of vendors sell jewelry, clothes, popcorn, etc behind the street. There are also rides for kids. \n\nThe BEST thing is that there are lots of porta-potties, and they are super clean! They even smelled good... at the end of the day! In the HOT HOT HOT sun. It was nice.\n\nSo next year: save up your money, hit up the fest, and try like 5 different rib places and then some corn... get some sodas or stop at one of the bars on the street, ...maybe do a little gambling -- and you'll definitely have a new favorite day of the year! \n\n[Make sure to get a hotel room in advance because this weekend is always booked in Reno! Completely! From Motel 6 to Grand Sierra Resort to the Nugget - everything!!]",

He wasn't friendly to me and prefaced the tour by apologizing that he was a lil hung over.  But I've been on brewery tours before so I know the process anyway.  \n\nAt the end I discovered Shock Top Raspberry which was soooo good.

The beef broth was very favorable and the meat was tender. They provided a very generous amount of toppings: bean sprouts, basil, lime, duck sauce, jalepanos. Each order of Pho was enough for two meals.\n\nWe've ordered Pho from here multiple times since and it's consistent and good. They normally have to go orders ready within 10 minutes.

They kept transferring me from sales to billing then billing to sales and back and forth having to explain my story each time.

Come to find out they had not even run it through my insurance yet. This was all over 3 different calls. So very upset and frustrated. Going to find new supplier. Update: After looking at mine and my husband's EOB from Insurance Verus had over billed us both. It it took 2 months and numerous calls to get a refund. All started first of July They said check had been sent in August then in September oh check has been on managers desk to sign. Got my husband's refund of $107 still waiting on my portion.

Yesterday my contractor went to pick up the tile and it was a  Versailles pattern. This pattern has 5 pieces, one of which is square. I went to see what the mix up was. The owner told me that I must have \"forgotten\" what type of tile I ordered and that he showed me all 5 pieces.  I explained that he did not , he only showed me a square piece and that I even had him come give me an estimate to set it diagonal . I told him that if he had shown me all 5 pieces I would have never ordered that. He was adamant that I did not remember what I ordered. He said he would let me order new tile but I'd have to pay a 25% restocking fee. He said the contract says no refund. While I was there he raised his voice at me, so I raised mine back. It became a shouting match at at one point he yelled SHUT UP. I yelled the same back . There was no reasoning with him . Now the tile is going to cost more to install because it more complex and more pieces. I think he should pay for the additional cost of $3150.00 dollars. He was not forth coming with what I bought . I had my contractor pick up the tile and I left , there is no reasoning with him . I'm appalled that he would treat a customer that way and believe that as a customer I don't know what I ordered! I have filed a complaint with the BBB and will seek legal action if he does not pay for the additional cost of installing the tile . I think I am being more than reasonable . I will never shop here again and will make all know of this awful experience!",

  "text": "There are not adequate words to describe how amazing Dr. K is with animals. She is literally the St. Francis of Nashville. I was gifted an American Bulldog puppy shortly after my husband suddenly passed away in 2013. Dr. K came highly recommended by my friend Jen who has owned and recused about a million dogs. Dr. K was just about to move from Value Vet to open her own practice on White Bridge Rd, so I decided to wait the couple of weeks for Lazarus' initial visit. He had his first round (or maybe two) of shots, but was not fully vaccinated. Before her office opened, he got very, very sick. \n\nMy friend Jen and I were thinking the worst - parvovirus. Jen gives me Dr. K's cell phone and having never met this woman, she said get him up here - now! The office was not opened yet, final construction was still going on with builders and workmen and supplier deliveries in and out...are we clear, this was a vet's office that was not ready for business. It didn't matter. She took him in her arms, tested him, confirmed it was parvo, hunted through boxes and bags and an unorganized mess to find what she needed and began treatment. She had me bring him in every other day for the first week for shots and fluids and SHE called me daily to check on him. In about ten days he turned the corner and recovered. With parvo, you either get better or you die - no in between. Lazarus would not be here today without Dr. K.\n\nShe later led my dad's precious Shih tzu, Scooter, over the rainbow bridge at age 16 when he had a stroke and was beyond help. She is simply the sweetest, most caring, compassionate, effective, intelligent person you can trust to treat your furry family members. I wish she treated humans - she would be my PCP in a heartbeat.\n\nOh, as a bonus, her prices for services are very reasonable. She could charge double what she does and it would still be a bargain for the care provided. Places like Murphy Road Animal Hospital should  be shaking in their boots with Dr. K as competition.",

  "text": "If, like me, you've avoided shopping at Whole Foods because you worried you'd blow your entire month's grocery budget on just one week's worth of groceries, this review is for you! While Whole Foods is definitely one of the priciest places in town to grab ingredients, some strategic shopping can really help take your home cooked meals to the next level. \n\nIn particular, the produce section is well-worth checking out as not only are the fruits and veg incredibly fresh, but there are also some rare/weird ingredients that will likely be impossible to find anywhere else in Nashville; I mean, the various farmers markets around town are great, but I've never seen satsumas (i.e., the best clementines you will ever eat), celery root, or kumquats there! I've also been cutting way back on my meat consumption, but I do still make one or two dishes a week with animal protein in them and I really appreciate how transparent WF is about where each meat product is from and how it is raised. Yes, you'll definitely pay more than you would for the anonymous bulk chicken you could get at Kroger, but I'm willing to pay a little bit extra to assuage my conscience about the meat I'm eating (and let's be honest,  meat that's raised on farms is going to be healthier than factory-farmed meat). I'd say you can pretty easily skip WF's frozen seafood selections, however, since I once got halibut here and it wound up having tons of bones in it (an issue I've never had with the frozen fish from Publix or Kroger).\n\nAnother huge plus to me is that you can get eggs and milk that are sourced from LOCAL farmers, which again, is worth a few extra dollars as far as I'm concerned. But it's also worth noting that the WF brand of organic milks and eggs are actually a bit cheaper than comparable products at Kroger, so not everything is necessarily pricier here. I've also found that if you're looking for frozen dinners and the like, if you stick to what's on sale, you can definitely walk away spending less than what you would at other stores (though the regular prices will definitely cost more than elsewhere).\n\nI can't say that I'm at a financial point in my life where I can buy all of my groceries at WF with impunity, but picking up a few unusual fruits/veggies and some \"happy\" meat is not nearly as cost prohibitive as you might think. Plus, if you feel like picking up a quick meal once your shopping is done (or before so that you can build up your energy?), the hot bar is always filled with yummy options... but be careful, because my husband and I have easily spent $30 there sampling random things! WF definitely feels like a luxurious shopping experience, but if you care about the quality of the food you ingest, I think you'll agree that buying certain core ingredients here and supplementing your shopping at a cheaper grocery store just makes sense!",

I was blown away by Peter & Co.'s service.\n\nThis was my first sit down, full meal at Saigon. Expectations: High. Reality: Really High. \n\nThis place is exactly why I travel. Nearly every city in America probably has something similar -- a strip mall tucked away in a unsuspecting area -- that is thriving with authenticity. Especially here, the Banh Mi & Pho! \n\nNow... that's not all they have... their menu is, well, how do I say it, um... HUGE!\n\nFrom lemongrass beef wraps to catfish in a clay pot. I went with the finest soup & sandwich of my life: bbq pork banh mi & Pho Special of flank steak, beef brisket, beef meatballs and tripe in classic Pho fashion. \n\nMy first visit I thought I was eating bbq beef banh mi, I was incorrect -- it's some stellar bbq pork that is spot on.\n\nThe bean sprout & fresh basil side plate with the pho was a supreme touch. \n\nThe service was pretty remarkable considering he's serving a party of 26 in a restaurant that seats about 40 at most. Um, the Yelp Supper Club came through -- big time here. At the other end of the table, I salivated, and salivated, for the Vietnamese Coffee that Jessica  & Rodney were having. My lord, I have to return midday before my coffee cut off time of 3pm. \n\nAnd then, something historic happened. There it was, the banh mi bbq pork (re: photo)... it sat there with it's open profile of pork, cilantro, cucumber, carrots & jalapeno on a french roll; she just couldn't resist. She, whom is anti-pork as my Inner Rabbi, my LP, took her first banh mi bite, and I have a Sakijewa golden dollar on it that she'll return for more!\n\nAs will I!\n\nNote: Amazingly classy touch of the sides of beer six packs cut out and taped above each booth in a row to display what beers are offered (which includes 3 Viet beers!)",

  "text": "Oh, Billy Bob's, I really wanted you to be more than three stars.\n\nWhen I went here for lunch today, I was pretty excited.  I had been looking forward to checking this place out since it had opened a few months ago.  I like BBQ and sandwiches (although I'm no BBQ aficionado) and I went in with an open mind.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, my friend and I were greeted by the manager and were immediately seated.  We then met our server who was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful.\n\nFor an app we ordered the fried pickles which came with ranch dressing and another dipping sauce.  They were really good and got me excited for the meal.\n\nI ordered the hamburger, only because I wasn't in the mood for a huge meal and my friend ordered the brisket.  I got an order of mac and cheese as my side.  When my burger came, it was dressed pretty basically with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  The burgers aren't cooked to order, and the one I had was pretty dry and over cooked.  It wasn't juicy at all and I didn't even finish it.  The mac and cheese was good, but it wasn't overly spectacular.  My friend ordered potato salad with the brisket, which I tried, and could tell that it was likely store bought (which isn't horrible, but I've had better).\n\nAll in all, the place was a solid three stars.  The staff was amazing, the atmosphere is nice and the food came quickly.  I was sad to see that there weren't more people in here.  I really am rooting for this place, especially because I think the Westbank needs an \"authentic\" BBQ place.",

  "text": "We ordered the Creole Trio and a 1/2 oyster 1/2 shrimp po boy to split. The trio had red beans and rice, gumbo, and jambalaya. The gumbo was my favorite. It was loaded with sausage. The jambalaya was flavorful, but the rice was too mushy. I liked the beans, but prefer them creamier. That is a personal preference so I don't hold that against them. \n\nThe po boy had enough shrimp, but only three small fried oysters. I know the price of oysters has gone up. The first oyster po boy we had during our trip was also lacking in the oyster department AND they added a $2 up charge. At least Desire did not have an up charge. \n\nOur server was quick and friendly. \n\nThey have decent beers on tap. \n\nIt was a quick place to stop and was pretty good. 3 1/2 stars.",

This place earned that seminal grant the hard way - by scraping barely-sufficient pennies together in crumbling warehouses for a decade - and earning the loyalty of area artists and art lovers for the duration.  Warhol allowed it to move into a clean, well lighted space finally...\n\n... with a gallery space large enough to do some good shows, & the other spaces - former admin offices of Tucson's Fire Dept. - the impromptu meditations on this space's history and future - just what I'd expect from a MoCA.\n\nI reconnected in 1 of those with a Walter Benjamin essay I hadn't read in decades, particularly apt for our contemporary situation [something about art and reproduction, you either know it or not], in another met the living room furniture for our near-future downsized living quarters, and in the gift shop discovered a local writer, Aaron Michael Morales.\n\nFew 'BIG CITY' museums have ever given me more.",

  "text": "My mom and I where in town. The first thing on our list was to find a french restaurant and so we did. Found it on one of the gem guides. We get there and already we had issues with seating, the tables where wobbling all over, finally moved to the 3rd table and was fine but we had to move all our plates, drinks etc ourselves (red flag)... I don't know if it was our skin color or what, but we felt something...Waitress greets us and was like rushing us to order. We ordered Pate, coquille saint jacques, garlic custard, stuff shrimp, onion soup, and the mussel which were cold you can tell it was sitting for a little while... After we ate a table next to us order the same mussell dish, to our suprise it came with a small fork and a big bowl to toss the shell....and we got crap!!! The best french food we've had in a long time since living in Tahiti and we are american/french!!! Unfortunately some of the staff  perticularly Vanessa just ruined it for this great french restaurant, you folks needs to bring in professionals to wait. Our bus boy and food runner  should of been our waiter, not once did she even bother to ask how we were doing....",

  "text": "First of all, and most importantly, the pizza is \"meh\". The ingredients seem very fresh but the dough tastes off somehow. I've tried the pizza three times now. It's hit and miss, kind of like the customer service at this place.  Speaking of that, as other reviewers have said, they don't take credit cards. The last holdout business in town, presumably because they can't afford it (although they'll pass the cost on to you in the form of a \"convenient\" ATM that will charge you a hefty fee). They can, however, afford to spend money on gaudy light up palm trees in their parking lot that cheapen up the neighborhood.  \n\nTip:  Do not order a Chicago style pizza to go. The cardboard box is woefully inadequate to handle the amount of sauce they drown the pizza in and you will end up with sauce all over you and/or your car. Also, apparently it's too much trouble to slice the pizza for you too, as ours was not sliced after we got the sopping wet box home. There was so much sauce it drowned out the other flavors of the pizza.  We threw most of the pizza away.",

You'll drive right by it if you're not careful as it's located more of in a residential neighborhood.\n\nTried breakfast on a weekend and were lucky enough to get a table for 7 (right near the front door) without a wait.  Inside definitely had that local restaurant feel that made you feel at ease.  Staff seemed generally cheerful; our waitress was alright as she seemed a bit impatient while we decided over the menu.  \n\nWatermelon juice tasted fresh as their menu offered a good variety of choices from granola w/yogurt & fruit to shrimp & grits.  My meal cost about $15 (incl. tip & tax) for juice & one menu item.  It's a decent place to go if you're in the area.\n\nFood: 4/5\nAmbiance: 4/5\nService: 4/5\nValue: 3.5/5",

  "text": "Two stars is sad... I hate giving negative reviews. But it's deserved. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. Perhaps it was built too hastily, perhaps it is just poorly maintained. Either way, on my mom and her friend's stay, everything that could have gone wrong did. I booked this based on shining reviews, location, and style. I thought it was a cool, swanky place that would be a cool experience for my mom, and it turned out to be a nightmare. Thank god she and her friend have a good sense of humor.\n\nSo here's what happened.\n\nThe first night in the room my mom and her friend go to pull down the curtain over the sliver of a window at the far left of the room -- which, let's stop right there -- this thing let's in as much light as a prison cell I'd imagine, don't expect the room in the picture with those big windows and nice views -- so this window was sad to begin with, but when they pull on the curtain the whole thing collapses on them. They kindly call the front desk, very sweet girl who works down there, and she sends the maintenance guy up, who is also very nice, but he informs them that the window curtain was broken to begin with and not properly installed so no wonder it came down on them. After some apologies they pack up their stuff at 10pm and are moved to the same room but 3 floors up.\n\nIn this new room they unpack and settle in, the curtain comes down without any hassle, so that's great. My mom decides to take a hot shower, but surprise, the water never gets hot. They call the front desk again and the same maintenance guy is set up again. They are promised hot water by the morning.\n\nSo then as they are laying in bed, relaxing and reading, they hear a loud BOOM. They don't even want to go around the corner to see what it is, but they do, and the clothing rack -- which by the way only provides you with 8 hangers (so 4 hangers each for a room that is suppose to be double occupancy) -- has broken and fallen down. I can't tell you that I've ever experience a solid wooden bar to fall to the ground with only 8 hangers worth of clothing. \n\nThey don't even bother call downstairs this time.\n\nSadly the woes would not end there -- the walls were so thin they could hear not only the sound of their neighbor pulling down Their curtain, but partying neighbors that were up all hours of the night to the point where they gave up on sleep at around 630am. And that \"chic retro\" clock ticked so loud that my mom ended up unplugging it and putting it in the bathroom. \n\nOn top of that, my mom's friend goes to shower with that hot water promised to them in the morning, but it's only mildly lukewarm again. To top it off, the shower drain was clogged and backed up so far she was worried it was going to spill over the lip of the tile. She took a picture and let it sit for and hour -- when she came back the bottom of the shower was STILL clogged up. So the maintenance guy was called up again to unclog the drain in the morning, and from that she witnessed the gallons of hair clogging it up.\n\nOn top of this, the pool is just ridiculously small and only has 4 lounge chairs. Yep. FOUR. For the ENTIRE hotel. And there's just one complimentary small bottle of Dasani in the room - I mean ok, the complimentary part is nice but for a room with 2 Queen beds that could hold up to 4 people you better hope you don't get thirsty in the middle of the night and make sure you ration your water out sparingly.\n\nThey were thankfully compensated free breakfast, free drinks, and parking, but this is nowhere near what they should have been compensated. I would say at least 1 night returned to them out of the 2 nights they stayed there. On top of that, my mom's friend left 3 voicemails on the general manager's phone that were NEVER returned. This is just bad business. There should have been a call even just to apologize for the series of unfortunate events that happened. \n\nWith it's terrible quality of rooms for the high price you pay, this place just fell flat on living up to it's expectations and promises. The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for the incredibly kind and awesome people they have working at valet, the front desk, and the maintenance guy. Either way, I'm booking my mom somewhere else next time. Good luck if you take a chance on it.",

  "text": "Victoria Park is the unsung gem of the River Valley! It is close to downtown but without the crowds of Hawrelak and Louise McKinney. During the winter they have a very large skating rink that is used by the Speed Skating community for practice as well as time trials. It is also open to the public most days and there is a sign posted with the schedule in the main lot. During the summer it has a ball diamond to use as well as a playground that is tucked away from the sun (good for families that have little ones). It is great for most outdoor activities such as baseball, volley ball, soccer, and kite flying and has easy access to the trails for roller skaters and bike riders. \n\nThe back of the park runs along the Victoria Golf Course and the east side meets up with the Royal Glenora Club. There have been many afternoons that I have searched for an open picnic spot in the valley but have had no luck in the other parks. Every time I find my self heading to Victoria and scolding my self for not just heading there in the first place. One perk is that it has year round washrooms which is great if you are into the snow sports that the valley can offer. My only complaint is that many people use it as a turn around for River Valley Road so at times it can be a touch noisy. \n\nAt the far back of the main field there is a great group picnic spot that has a very large fire pit made out of a concrete ring. It is big enough to have a bon fire and is encircled in low benches so it is ideal for a large group. During the summer there is also a small trailer parked in the main lot that sells BC fruit which is the perfect treat on a hot summer day.\n\nI highly recommend stopping by to take a look at one less traveled parks that the River Valley has to offer.",

Prices are what you would expect at a resort, not cheap, but not crazy. Three drinks and dinner for about $40.",

I get that you're selling pipes that are 99% of the time being used for smoking marijuana, but that doesn't mean your employees should be stoned off their asses. It's pretty sad when you have to tell the guy 3 times that the glass pipe he grabbed wasn't the want I wanted to see. Every employee in there looks like a typical stoner that just rolled out of bed and is late for a college class. Bunch of Wake and Bakers who threw on the clothes they wore at the party the night before and stumbled into work because they slept in and were running late.",

If we want a cheap stay in the French Quarter, this is the place!\nParking = you pull in what looks like a small alleyway.  Our Envoy SUV fit, so most cars should fit easily.  Valet comes out to greet you and you take an elevator to your room.  There are no amenities such as pool, business center, gym, room service.  Just enjoy a cheap, clean room in the middle of the French Quarter.",

  "text": "I've said it before and I'll say it again: One of the most pathetic feelings in life is running for a bus with your big dumb bag and seeing that bus pull away. So close, so close... Oh I've been there and I've vowed never to be that particular feeb again.\n\nI was reminding myself of this very promise to myself the other day when I saw Gigi and Big R's food truck parked outside of 30th Street Station. I was already on the verge of being late for that accursed megabus to NYC, but I still found myself tempted to stop for some of this truck's Caribbean stylins. \n\nNO. I had to put my foot down with me. You know why? Cause if runnin late for a bus with your big dumb bag is pitiful, nearly missing a bus, running with luggage and a styrofoam container heavy with fried flaky white fish, rice & beans, cabbage, and plenty of hot sauce shakings is even more risky business. But I WAS tempted, cause that was some good cookin there. I mean, I thought about it.\n\nWe had split that hefty platter when we encountered Gigi and Big R at the Mann Center in September. The deal was kinda pricey at about $15, but I will say that they did give you plenty. We shared it in the rain, under an umbrella on the lawn: Crispy fish fried in long strips, tender sauteed down cabbage, rice and beans, and hot sauce. \n\nSee, that would be a nice lunch for you on the bus, if you indeed made it, except that everyone would want to murder you dead for fillin the bus with the delectable smells, and for enjoying your life or whatever. Yeah, you can't be eating on the bus. I reminded myself of that fact too. That's another thing.  What everyone on the bus has in common with each other is that they inherently loathe everyone else on the bus. Why? I can't tell you, but damn don't it seem to be so. On my way back from NYC one time some cat brought on the bus with him some dirty water dogs from a cart. You could feel the hate for him grow every time he pulled another one outta the brown bag. Like, the nerve...who does he think he is?\n\nSo yeah, I wanted that fried fish platter, alright. I wanted it. I'll get it the next time that I'm not running late for the bus. Plan ahead, sister.",

Upon arrival, a man with a wizard like cape will greet you and gather your bags to escort you to check in. The hotel allowed us to check in early without question so that was nice. The room itself is basic and nothing to speak of. THe hotel is undergoing renovations so it has a few places that look undesirable.\n\nThe bellhop staff is great and very helpful, Especially, Ebanks. However, the front desk staff is just average. \n\nNow, to what sparked me to write this interview.. There are no vending machines or microwaves in this building. I am 8 months pregnant and those thins are essential. How can I not be able to buy snacks when I need them? All of he walking you do here, a vending machine is necessary as it is annoying as ____ to have to walk to local stores to get bottled water. Also, there is no microwave available for guests to use. This is major as NOLA is a prime place to eat and staying here, you would not be able to reheat any of the delicious food you purchase. Right now I'm looking at lobster Mac and cheese and stuffed red fish that I cannot eat because there is no microwave. Honestly, this is a major turn off for me and for that reason, I would never stay here again. Obviously, I'm pissed, but for 1200 dollars for two people , I need a microwave. Rant over!",

I immediately loved the atmosphere of this restaurant, it was very calm and classy and the servers were incredibly responsive and professional. \n\nAlthough afterwards it was clear I was not a fan of Japanese food, I still had a wonderful time. It helped that I was with great company but in addition, the atmosphere and impeccable service. \n\nIf you're a fan of Japanese food, or would like to try it out, this is the place to do it. The prices are also quite reasonable and the amount of food provided is impressive.",

  "text": "Why didn't I know about the Rib Cook Off before???  This year was my first time going and you better believe I'm going every year from now on!  We stayed at the Nugget so our backyard was the Rib Fest.  We arrived Friday morning which was the best idea because we were able to walk the whole festival with ease.  There were some people but it wasn't as bad as Friday night and Saturday which are the busiest times.  We had ribs galore (my personal favorite was Bone Daddy's - marinated perfectly, bbq sauce had a little bit of heat to it and the meat was falling off the bone good!), beef ribs, corn, cornbread, cole slaw, beans, ice cream, deep fried zucchini, funnel cakes and beer!  It doesnt get better than this but I'm definitely detoxing all the meat consumption still.  We woke up Saturday morning went downstairs to buy more ribs and brought it into our hotel because the crowd was approaching.  Sunday we also went early to buy a full slab of ribs to take home.  It says they open at 11am but we went down at about 10:30 and were able to get our orders in.\n\nI'm coming back next year and I'm sticking to the same game plan.  Arrive early Friday until Sunday and staying at the Nugget.  Can't wait for you to come back Rib Fest! Yummmm!",

  "text": "We went to Katie's on a busy Friday night.  Fortunately, we had reservations because the wait when we arrived was over 1-1/2 hours.  I would say on the weekends reservations are a must and perhaps on weeknights as well.  This is a very popular place for modern, creative pizzas, pastas and other related cuisine.\n\nMs T and I ordered a Caprese Salad and a Meatball pizza to share.  Our friends the D's did about the same thing, with different salad and different pizza.  They also brought a bottle of good chianti to share.  Katie's will do corkage for $20.\n\nWe were both disappointed in the Caprese Salad.  I knew when they placed it on the table that the large, yellow heirloom tomato was way over-ripe.  I could see that it was mushy and it indeed tasted over-ripe in that it had lost its flavor and had no backbone (like an over mature wine that loses its fruit and acid).  This should not have been served.  With good tomatoes, this would have been a good salad.  Again, heirloom or not; local or not, they still have to taste good and have good texture.  I liked the fresh mozzarella but will say the basil was very skimpy on it.  The overall serving was generous, but considering the price, it needed to be.\n\nOur pizza was just OK, not remarkable.  The meatballs are not seasoned much, but the cheese and sauce were good, as was the crust.  The pizzas are probably 10\" to 12\" and it was easy for the two of us to eat it all, which is something we never do.  I asked for fresh chiles on my half of the pizza and there were not more than  1/2 teaspoon of finely minced chiles serranos that I could see and barely taste.  I paid $2 for that addition.  At least four times as much chile would have been good.\n\nYou have to appreciate fru-fru pizzas more than we do to appreciate Katie's.  It is one of those trendy places, popular for being popular, that I expected more from.  This is also an expensive place.  Our bill was $50 for a small pizza, a salad and  1/2 of the corkage.  Ms T thinks three stars over-rates this meal.",

  "text": "OK I don't understand why the star ratings so far are so bad if everyone is saying they really liked the food. Maybe the ratings are from competitors?\n\nSo here is the REAL blow-by-blow breakdown of this place.\n\nYES it is mobbed. That's because there is a HUGE HUGE HUGE pent-up demand for fast casual Mexican in Tampa, and people are flocking there. After all, let us review our options for fast Mexican food in Tampa Bay: \n\n1. Chipotle = Sodium-filled food, pre-cooked and later boiled in plastic bags. A digestive nightmare.\n\n2. Tijuana Flats/Moe's = Can't really tell the difference between these crapholes; \nboth are substandard Mex joints that would go out of business in California, Texas, etc.\n\n3. Taco Bus = Tasteless food served in cardboard tortillas in a dirty restaurant.YUM!\n\n\nBut back to Lime Fresh:\n\nDo not just show up. Place your order online before you head over there. When you get there, go to the back of the restaurant where the takeout cashier is. Pay for your food there, take it to a table, and eat. This took me 5 minutes. And watch everyone else wait in line for 30 minutes. I had the chicken soft tacos and my friend had the chicken cobb salad. Both were good. Both tasted fresher than any food at the above-mentioned places.\n \nLime Fresh is not the same as Moe's, Tijuana Flats or Chipotle. It is much much better. Is it the best Mexican food you have ever had? NO. Is it authentic Mexican, Cal-Mex, Tex-Mex, etc.? NO. Is it better than the fast food Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, California, etc.? NO. But is it better than Chipotle, Tijuana Flats, etc.?\nYES!!!!!!!\n\nThe ingredients here are much fresher than at Chipotle and Tijuana Flats, you can taste it. (Well, let's face it, the food from Chipotle comes already cooked in plastic bags, which they later boil.) The execution with some of the meats at Lime Fresh is not there yet, but I am hopeful they will get better with that.\n\nThis place is automatically better than the above mentioned places JUST for the extensive salsa bar, which is standard in Cali, Ariz, Texas, etc. but most no one else in Tampa has. And the pico de gallo is pretty decent, as are the other salsas. The menu is extensive, the dining space is nice and huge, the online order process was seamless.\n\nI would def. go back when it's off-peak hours.",

There were lots of options for treats ranging from cupcakes, cake slices, tarts, bars, cookies etc. So many yummy choices made it hard to choose! I had the Dolce De Leche tart and it was so rich and filling, plus the presentation was beautiful--they clearly put a lot of care into how all of their treats look as well as taste. They have espresso drinks and teas too. I got a small Matcha latte which was actually quite big, so that was a nice surprise. There is a small amount of seating inside but we were able to find a spot. The place is super bright and nicely decorated inside. All around a very cute, clean, welcoming place.

That would explain the large amount of square footage, but all signs for this location, both inside and outside, clearly show this is now a Dollar Tree.\n\nAlso, any store where an employee sees a long line at one register and announces he or she is opening another register to move customers along gets my approval.\n\nI would not recommend parking in the front row of spaces just outside the front door/windows because it can be dicey backing out of those spots when leaving because it is so close to a high traffic entrance/exit to the nearby road. Use the lot away from the front of the store and you can get in and out without any trouble.",

Unlike UPS  whose drivers are unionized and excellent drivers because they have to work at a location facility before they become drivers Fedex hires anybody that can walk and talk. Because I am handicapped I have special needs but they are totally ignored by Fedex drivers. I've had shipments put in my yard on top of my chaise lounge which is seven steps down.  You can no longer call any of their facilities directly. They have totally done away with all the phone numbers and then when you do get someone on the phon, their 800 number which is a joke you wonder how they find their way to work.  \n\nThis company is still independently owned and the owner has set this up to benefit himself. All the trucks are leased through third parties; he does not own any of the trucks at all. Smart for him, too bad for us. \n\nI currently have a lawyer looking at a lawsuit because living in California and being handicapped I should be protected from businesses that can't deliver my \npackages where I can get them safely.  \n\nI have requested from Amazon not to use FedEx at all for my deliveries because they just can't seem to get their act together.",

  "text": "Coming from South Korea and having been to Japan ramen has a special place in my heart. I was very excited to find that Tucson had an actual Ramen establishment. So I had been told that the wait here is pretty bad and not to go during the peak hours. Wellll I went on a Saturday mid morning and I'm sure the number of hungover college kids getting breakfast and the super proactive families getting lunch definitely added to the wait time. The door says to wait in line and they will get our names. It also says that some Yelper thinks it's a stupid system. Well yeah IM AGREEING WITH THAT OTHER YELPER. Like a good law abiding citizen our party of three patiently wait infront of the restaurant waiting for them to \"come get our name\".  I notice people who just drove up (also party of 3) walk in and a few moments later walk out. So I'm like ok maybe they were told to go back out and wait. Then this same thing happens again with a different party of 3. I follow the second group inside only to find out they were getting their names put on the list. At this point I'm just over everything and just want my damn ramen since I've been waiting for no reason for 25 mins already. I finally get our names put down and then another 25 minutes, and those two other parties of 3, later, we get called. Ordered Takoyaki (tastes great but just wish it had a LITTLE more octopus in it) also got the Black garlic oil Tonkatsu Ramen ( got everything on the side because I knew I would finish it all and didn't want my noodle to get all soggy if I wanted to eat the left overs/ broth was super refreshing and the chashu pork was delicious. The tamago for ramen is definitely supposed to be soft boiled and as someone who thoroughly enjoys YOLK PORN I was sadly disappointed. It was just a hard boiled egg sat in soy sauce for a short time period). Hubs ordered the Umami Shoyu and he said it was very tasty. Will be going back but screw waiting outside for them to \"come get you\".",

I would like to try a different night, this is not a large buffet though they offered various seafood choices from lobster ravioli to, seabags, salmon, 5 kinds of shrimp. I would like to have seen sushi at least some basic rolls. Desert sets this place apart from cotton candy, ice cream to cake that is not dried out. We ate early at the opening which may have contributed to this but for the city of Reno is I want a buffet this is probably it.",

We were there for two hours and got three drinks -- not for lack of finishing them, but for lack of our server checking on us at all. By the time we got our third drink there were 3 sets of empty glasses on the table because she never took anything back. Dirty plates sat on our table from when we finished our food until when we left. We even turned the call server light on in hopes of getting her attention. That was a waste as she walked past three times without paying attention. When confronted, she told us she had been waiting the tables outside but we were sat by the window and could see that she had not been out there. We had been anticipating a fun night out and dollar drinks to celebrate a new job, but we were thoroughly let down.",

If you're a fan of OPI (which I am), they have a pretty decent nail polish selection: mostly basic pinks, reds and darks. They didn't have my favorite colors Chocolate Mousse and Nomad's Dream, but I settled with some other similar colors. The staff is really pleasant and had no issue adjusting anything from pedicure bath water to my request for very thin, natural looking acrylics. \n\nThe biggest con for me was their attempt to do my acrylics while I was still getting my feet done. I can understand if I was in a rush and requested it, but I was just puzzled and told them I would get it done after my pedicure. Of course, I was sad that they didn't have my favorite colors :(\n\nThe best thing about this place is the pricing. 50$ for a mani/pedi and acrylic full set. I didn't catch my manicurists' name, but it's the only male there and he was a beast at doing my nails. Made them natural and just how I like them, and did it literally in 30 minutes with no errors.

  "text": "Why one star you might be wondering? It has nothing to do with the hotel itself. We rented a suite on the 10th floor conveniently located right across from their roof-top bar \"Jimmie's Crow Nest\" which offers spectacular view of the gulf and the marina and a stretch of downtown. Perfect place to be to experience the wonderful sunsets and they even serve up a free shot at sunset. Yet you absolutely cannot hear a sound once in your room. Room was large with comfortable beds, decent sized bathroom and a small kitchenette area. Hotel located about a 5 minute (tops) walk to the beach and Pier 60. Easy walk to shops, restaurants, bars, etc. Breakfast was okay. Sausage was good. Floppy eggs were strange. Various bread offerings and two toasters. Fresh orange juice. Terrible coffee. I mean, absolutely horrendous. I got up each morning and took a stroll to Starbucks up the street to grab a coffee and then return to have the hotel breakfast. \n\nNow the reason for the single star. The morning we left, roughly 30-40 minute ride to airport, our driver somehow failed to load one of our suitcases. Not sure how that could have happened, it being the largest of the five suitcases standing there. Nobody noticed until we got to the airport. Luckily nothing of any value in the suitcase. We called the hotel and whoever was at the desk said they'd go down to parking and look and call us back. They did, found the suitcase, and called us back. So far so good. They asked us to call back after 9am to speak with a manager. We would be in the air at that time so said we'd call back around 11am-ish to make arrangements. When we landed we called and asked if they could ship our suitcase back to us - at our expense of course. They said they could not do that. We asked if they could call their local UPS or whoever and have them pick up and ship it to us. They were unable to do that either. Essentially, the hotel refused to assist us in any way to get our suitcase back!  I have to assume that people forget items all the time. Is it then hotel policy to basically say, sorry, not our problem? Cause that's great customer service. They instead instructed us to call a local UPS to have that done. We call a few UPS shops in Clearwater but none of those we called were \"official\" UPS shops and so would not be able to send anyone to the hotel to pick up our suitcase. We needed to get the suitcase to them. Which the hotel refused to do. We finally got hold of someone at UPS \"Official\" who recommended we get in touch with someone at FedEx. Which we did. We ended up paying someone $20 to drive to the hotel and pick up our suitcase and take it back to FedEx to be shipped. My wife spent two days on the phone to make this happen. \n\nIf the hotel had been willing to lift a finger, this could have been resolved in an hour. Maybe two. And what would have easily been a glowing 5-star review ends up a 1-star review. Sad.",

The fried chicken is not a flour batter, but something else that makes it so light and crispy. \n\nThe beef stew with noodles is incredible. HUGE chunks of beef and pillowy soft carrots will send you into bliss for a bit. Ease yourself back to reality with the mango/Mexican chili smoothie. Another genius move with the combo. \n\nThe Lemongrass chicken was good, but a bit overrated. I feel that the lemongrass was a bit faint.  Pretty creative to put this Thai twist with a Vietnamese traditional cold noodle, but I'm afraid that it's more \"pretty\" than tasty. \n\nOf course, get the sticky chicken wings. I can eat those all day. \n\nToo bad I live across the country from this place and only have memories and pictures to lean on. Baaaaaaaaaahhhh",

  "text": "Underwhelming and overpriced. Pizza Fusion seems to have a lot of hype and a lot of potential but it is poorly executed. I would give them 2.5 stars... most people would round to 3, but I'm sticking to two because my experience wasn't really \"A-OK.\"\n\nEven with a Creative Loafing deal AND a nightly special, I feel like we really overpaid... $27 for a large Do-It-Yourself Pizza alone. How is that possible? This is how: they don't tell you on the menu that the base pizza is $12 (I looked for pricing and there was none). They do tell you that each topping is between $2 and $4 (or more), but you would expect that to be the full cost of the pizza since only those prices are listed, leaving ours at $15 but alas it was actually almost twice that much. Dang! The final product was good, but for that price I can get three equally good take out pizzas. When you add my small white pizza to the mix, our bill was ridiculously high. I do not recommend this place unless you have a CL voucher. They are priced high assuming you will have one. Here is the link: http://www.cldeals.com/products/valid-at-pizza-fusion-downtown-tampa-25-value-2\n\nWant to know something else they don't tell you? The soda is not normal coke product. It's their supposedly organic version, which tastes like a flat diet coke with a whole cup of Truvia added to it... like a previous reviewer said, it's basically cough syrup. They really should tell us this when we order. My \"diet coke\" was so gross I cringed when I took the first sip and literally could not force myself to get it down. I have never felt that way about any other soda or drink for that matter. Trust me, I know what Truvia tastes like as I use daily it in my shakes and cooking... and I know it's better than aspartame... but this was WAY TOO MUCH TRUVIA! I was so turned off by this product. Yuck.\n\nThe service was pleasant but super slow/sparce and we watched as everyone was served before us. As for the food itself, it was alright but honestly not amazing. I wasn't blown away. Also, I ordered the wheat crust and got the regular one on my pizza... didn't make it an issue, but it added to the overall annoyances. \n\nI really wanted to like this place. I really did. But Pizza Fusion and I are not meant to be. I won't give them good reviews just because they offer gluten-free items.\n\nSummary: okay food, kinda bad service, really bad value, overall a super MEH experience.",

  "text": "This was my favorite part of our trip this past week! We really wanted to do a swamp tour and read through reviews and ended up with Cajun Encounters. We liked the idea of not having an airboat which can be super noisy and windy. \n\nA few people from our hotel were going to the same tour. The concierge came outside to ask if we were all going and said the bus had called and asked us to meet them elsewhere because it was actually too big to fit down the narrow French Quarter streets! We walked about 3-4 blocks to Canal St. to meet the full size coach bus. (Cajun Encounters offers the pick up service for an extra charge, but it's worth it for ease). \n\nThe first thing I loved was that the bus driver was super friendly, a native of NOLA. A bachelor party was being kind of bro-y in the back and she quickly shut them up with made me want to hug her. She told them the night before they were so bad she'd called the police to have them escort the guys back to their hotel...\n\nAnyway! She asked if we wanted to hear some New Orleans info on our ride down and the majority of us said sure. The ride out to the swamp was about ~40 minutes. She told us about the different areas we were passing through, the graveyards, Hurricane Katrina, stealing crabs as a teenager, etc. etc. She was really enjoyable to listen to. \n\nWe got to the Encounters spot and she gave us very clear directions on how to check in, what will happen, etc. You go inside and show the counter your ticket/reservation/phone receipt and they give you a colored stretchy bracelet (like a livestrong one). That tells you what boat/group you'll be with. We waited outside for about 15 minutes and they started calling all the groups and walking us down to the water. We (and the girls who also came from our hotel) breathed a sigh of relief when the bachelor bros were not on our boat :)\n\nOur boat sat about 25 people - two long bench type seats, each facing outward. We were on the tail end so occasionally we sat on the very front of the boat more up at water level. I don't remember our guide's name but he was informative and funny. On our tour, we saw a few alligators - the guides know where to find some favorites. We also spotted some babies, some cool herons/cranes, A BALD EAGLE SWOOPING DOWN TO CATCH PREY (so cool! So mad I didn't get a photo), and even a baby and adult raccoon! At first our tour was primarily in a wider water area and I thought \"huh, not exactly what I pictured as much\" but later on in the tour, we went past our boarding dock and went the other way and THAT'S where the swamp I was picturing was. Narrow routes - I'm pretty amazed the boat captains can steer so well to not just hit every tree in the way. A few times he'd just turn the motor off and we'd try to spot critters in the woods. I got the sweetest video of him feeding the adult raccoon - it used its little paws to grab the hot dog! (I may like animals a teeny bit). \n\nThe tour was about 2 hours total. Fantastic. It was fun, relaxing, informative, and friendly - the other people in the boat were all easy going and helped point out cool animals and spots so everyone could get photos. Definitely go to this place if you're in the area! (also look for coupons - I think I saved us $20!)",

I can't make up my mind but I can tell you this is a good restaurant to visit if you have a group who wants Chinese food but can't decide what kind. They have all the usual lunch specials and they're very well prepared. They have several more authentic Noodle and rice dishes and some Curry's all of which that I've tried have been good. Their ribs on are the old style large red Chinese ribs... very tasty. And if you're a vegetarian and feel left out there are about 10 to 12 dishes on the vegetarian/vegan menu.",

  "text": "If you want to know the truth, Parc is the gold standard by which I compare other restaurant experiences.  It never disappoints. Everything on the menu is so perfect that I almost want to cry.  I mean, why can't every restaurant make a simple salad as elegant as what Parc offers.  For that matter, why can't I make a simple salad that is as elegant?  Even the French fries make you regret what you have stuffing in your mouth all these years.  And Philly's deluxe bakeries should be ashamed of what they have been calling a baguette. Save your white bread quota for a visit to Parc and fill up.  I especially love the warm shrimp salad: plump shrimp, slices of avocado that are ALWAYS perfectly ripe, and a beautifully dressed salad.  It's so virtuous you feel like you've earned dessert.  Oh yeah -- and another menu item that brings tears to my eye is the Bloody Mary. Why can't I make something this good????? If you think you have a recipe to rival this one, please please please share it with me.",

I was here a few weeks ago with my two young boys and we had a few bumps in the road over the course of evening with the final one being the most dramatic for my sweet 5 year old. He'd captured a large bounce ball after spending 1500 points to get it out of the giant claw machine (all 10 people in front of us got one on their first try) but nonetheless he came away with a large green ball and was SO proud! Before we could make our exit, he put it down to play air hockey and in less than 20 seconds someone swiped it! I had turned my back for only a moment. Couldn't believe it. I talked to a few people while tears streamed down his cheeks and after a few minutes, a green ball was \"found.\" The young gentlemen and a few of the ladies that helped us were so sweet to him. They turned our night back around fast. We're a few hours away, but we'll recommend to our friends and we'll be back! Treat the staff kindly please!",

I had a breakfast croissant. Subbed bacon for ham- no problem at all. Had the breakfast potatoes. It was all really good. I know what you are thinking. \"Sounds pretty basic, can't really mess that up\" oh, but believe me, you can. People mess it up time and time again. There were some fresh greens and sliced tomatoes to add a little brightness too. Hubs ordered a grilled chicken sand which, cooked fresh to order- it looked really good. I heard no complaints. Coffee was good and refilled promptly. Honestly, this has been my best food experience in awhile!",

  "text": "I was looking through the YELP reviews trying to find something interesting to try.  I  stumbled onto \"Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop\".  I think my search was focused on corny names.  Anyhow, based on the good reviews, we stopped in on a Saturday evening.  Easily the best decision I made all week.\n\nThe food was awesome!\n\nThe \"Stop\"  is located in a strip mall just north of the I-10 Causeway cloverleaf.  There is a well lit sign on the east side of the cloverleaf.  If you are coming from I-10 you have a choice, You can make an illegal u-turn, dive into the right lane and pull up to the front of the restaurant.  The faint of heart can make a legal left turn, make the next two lefts and pull right up next to the strip mall .\n\nThis is a relatively small place.  Maybe 20 seats, a couple more at the bar. Decor stretches the boundaries of eclectic.....  We obviously missed the dinner rush, I think maybe 3 - 4 people were seated when we arrived.  We sat right next to the mermaid.  \n\nService was quick and friendly.  Someone I assume is Chef Ron was out a couple of times to check on us.  Nice, polite but not clingy - no war stories or life histories.  Interesting that he assumed we were from out of town (must be worldly demeanor and classic good looks).  When he found out we were from Destrehan, he commented that \"he loved to get locals in\".\n\nDown to the food - nothing short of great.  All the reviews raving about the seafood gumbo is absolutely accurate. The turkey wrap was enormous and stuffed full of real turkey.  My real find was the potato salad.  This is the best potato salad I have had in New Orleans.   \n\n$50 for 2 including drinks and tips.  I'm excited about going back and trying some of the other sides.",

This place use all fresh fruits for their drink which I'm willing to pay a few quarters more instead of artificial powders like other places.  I recommend stopping by for their avocado smoothie with 20% sugar, since I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake, but pretty much everything on their menu is good. Staffs are very friendly so that's a plus. The only downside is that there are no seats around this place since it's a mall kiosk spot but no big deal. Will be my go to place for smoothies and boba drinks in the mall area.",

  "text": "Our large group of nine came in for dinner and they could not handle it. Three of our party opted for AYCE, and the rest of us ordered various rolls and bento boxes. While my rolls were arbitrarily one of the ones that came out fast, it seemed like most people's orders fell by the wayside and/or were forgotten in lieu of those of the AYCE-ers. Two bento boxes and a veggie roll took literally about an hour to come out, and only after walking up to the counter to inquire about the orders and multiple check-ins with our waiter. They clearly need to organize the ordering process better in general and/or reprioritize non-AYCE orders above AYCE orders; since naturally AYCE orders continue over a long period of time, it is a bad idea to wait for a lull in that in order to prepare food for others in the same group. The sushi was decent, but I am turned off from coming back again due to the inconsistent and slow service.",

  "text": "Good food, especially the nachos and brisket quesadilla! I had great drinks, for a reasonable price, a wonderful waitress, but I had a horrible experience with management. \n\nUnfortunately there was a grouchy female manager who walked in to the restroom and announced that she would be closing a tab for my myself, a friend, and my dad shortly after our meal began. My friend and I went to the bathroom on the second floor near our table. I have anxiety about touching public surfaces, especially since the start of COVID as I am immune compromised. My friend opens, closes, locks, and touches surfaces for me to help ease the anxiety when situations arise. As I began using the restroom, the manager knocked and informed myself and our guests that our tab would be closed. I said that is absolutely understandable and we would be happy to leave if it would make her more comfortable . She kept repeating that she would close the tab, which l told her was completely fine, as my guests and I just yearned for the experience of the restaurant since it opened only 3 days ago, and atmosphere more than anything, including the drinks. I really enjoyed this restaurant. The line was short for the bar, and we got in on a Saturday within 15 minutes. It was only a 30 minute wait for the restaurant, and they texted us when they were ready. I just wish management wouldn't have been so aggressive to us for using the same stall since other guests were occupying the other one, and been more understanding to mental health concerns, especially during this day in age. It seemed like it bothered her more that were using a restroom quickly one after the other than two full paying, tipping customers. Apparently for the bridal party that was ok, but not for us.\n\nOther then that, I recommended going, just don't bother using a bathroom stall with a friend. Also--don't forget to stop on the way out to the gift shop for a cute tee!",

Several hours after dropping off my car, I was called by a technician and told it my throttle module had to be sent to GM to be rebuilt and that there was a 3-5 week lead-time. Obviously not ideal, but something I understood - it is a 1997 Corvette and parts may have been discontinued. Five weeks later, I received a call that GM was waiting for part, and it would be up to two weeks longer until the work was done.\n\nI was frustrated and I vented my frustration. I was contacted by the owner of Blossom Chevrolet and he walked me through the entire process of what had been done/what was being done to ensure my vehicle was repaired and I was informed. Unfortunately, some repairs require multiple moving parts/entities and those variables are sometimes impossible to account for - this was one of those rare cases. He apologized for my inconvenience, and understood my frustration.\n\nWhile there may be hiccups in the process due to unforeseen circumstances, but there are good people at Blossom who will do their best to ensure customers are informed and satisfied.

  "text": "5 stars for cleaning, 1 star for prices (and the process).\n\nAfter researching dry cleaners on Yelp, none of the ones close to Chalfont were highly rated nor had many details written about them, so I took a chance with this cleaners who are located close to home. I took 5 dresses and a small jacket to get priced, and the lady handed me a paper quote well over $100. I was SHOCKED. I told her there is no way this is feasible, then she told me to hold on and discounted 15% to just under $100. What? When did dry cleaning become a negotiation service? Not professional. Even with the quote, it was way too high. So, I picked out my most expensive items to get cleaned, then the lady asked what I would like to pay for them. I told her there is no way they can match what I'm used to paying, told her my previous experiences, and she asked if $15 a dress was ok. Since they were expensive dresses, I said yes. Both dresses had jewels on them which were considered \"special cleaning\" so the rate was supposedly a bit higher. However, the other dresses I took home were basic black dresses and not special cleaning, but they still gave me the same rate for ALL dresses on paper, which makes the process even more shady. \n\nHere's the thing...I just moved from Dallas (Highland Park area, which is the most expensive zip code in the city, not to brag at all, but read my point), and I never paid such high prices. Most standard dry cleaners offered a flat $2-3 per piece rate. For special cleaning items, I occasionally paid up to $10 for a high-end brand at the most expensive place in Dallas, but usually $5-7 at the normal places, and they always turned out fine. The median income for Dallas/Highland Park is much higher than Chalfont, so it's difficult to believe that everyone around here pays close to $15 per piece of clothing.\n\nWhile the cleaning turned out just fine, I would not go back unless I had an expensive piece of clothing to dry clean, and even then, I'm still not sure if I would go as I felt the back and forth negotiation and haggling of prices was completely absurd. The language barrier was also high throughout this process, so that also did not help.",

Certainly, geared towards the business traveler. There are not many couches or comfy chairs. \nThe bar is fully stocked with creative cocktails and a diverse wine list. I didn't look at the beer list in detail, but did notice they carried local beers on draft. The food is buffet style and Mediterranean forward. If it's not your jam, you may want to eat before heading in. I love Mediterranean so I enjoyed  the majority of the options. They have a small salad area with spring mix, beets, roasted acorn squash, tomatoes, tabbouleh, beans, and some others. For hot food there was brisket with carrrots, roasted potatoes, rice, lamb meatballs, and a squash/tomato soup. It was good, not great. They also had an assortment of cookies and a passion fruit custard that was entirely too bitter and sour. \n\nI didn't have coffee or tea, but they had some great options there. Because it was close to the holidays Santa made a brief appearance. \nNote: you can only order one drink per person. So if you're with others they will need to get their own drink. Mild inconvenience, but again the bar was wonderfully stocked. \n\nf you bring children ensure they are well-behaved as this is geared towards the business person. There's not a lot of room for them to move around. It's fairly small. \n\nI spent a good four hours there due to a delay, enjoyed the drinks and left with a full tummy.

I've liked the pho that much I haven't tried anything else.  Every place's pho is juuuust a bit different so you're really just gonna have to try it all over to find your favorite.\n\n*edit\nTo be honest I don't particularly think this place is THAT great, but my wife certainly does and they have by far her favorite pho.  When she somehow convinces me to come all the way down here it makes me dislike this place just a bit more -_-",

We arrive on time and the host says that most of our party has already arrived, so we follow her lead. Turns out we were the first to arrive and they had given our section away to crashers, It was almost funny to see the hostess and servers disappear into hiding and leaving us standing there awkwardly looking over the people that had our table. Fair play to the female bartender that finally addressed us and offered to seat us at he bar. Since we had kids and a wheelchaired person, we left and walked into Gators to be seated instantly.",

  "text": "This hotel is quite well-situated at the northern edge of the French Quarter, not far from Bourbon Street or the RiverWalk.  The rooms are standard Courtyard by Marriott rooms, though with fewer amenities than I've seen at others - no hot tub, fewer freebies in the room, no coffee maker, and so forth.  The room itself was quite pleasant, I was happy with the bed...not too hard or too soft.\n\nI did not have a chance to experience 5 Fifty 5, their onsite restaurant, but I heard from other convention attendees that it was good.  Likewise for the bar in the lobby...I heard positive reviews but did not try it myself.  I did try the lobby Starbucks (full-service, very nice) and the gift shop (almost no service, few items had actual prices on them).\n\nThe meeting facilities were fine.  Water was always available in the major rooms, although not in the smaller rooms.  If you find yourself needing to go to a \"Balcony\" room, be aware that the 4th floor is only accessible from the River Tower, not the Quarter Tower.  If you are on the 3rd floor on the Quarter side, you might happen upon the staircase leading to the 4th floor, but it's better to save time and go straight to the elevators of the River side.  Also, several bathrooms near the breakout rooms were broken, and we had to go from the 4th floor Balcony rooms to the 2nd floor Exhibit Hall just to use the bathroom.\n\nA special word of caution about the elevators.  The system is called Miconic 10, and I've never seen it elsewhere.  It's designed to move people more efficiently, and I'm sure it does move people FASTER, but it's LESS user-friendly than a standard elevator.  My biggest word of advice is: ALWAYS press your desired floor before boarding.  If you want to run and catch an elevator before it leaves your floor, you'd do better to wait...I tried this once but nobody was going to the lobby and I ended up on the 19th floor instead!  Once you are inside the elevator, there is NO WAY to control where it goes.  Press your floor BEFORE entering and go to the elevator the panel tells you to.  Also, people with mobility issues should press the little handicapped symbol first.  It will make sure your elevator is less crowded, and the doors will remain open longer.  Miconic 10 is well-suited to office buildings, but NOT hotels, so be warned!",

  "text": "If you like beer at all and are around the Philadelphia area, you really should do yourself a favor and take a trip to this brewery.  There are many interesting beers that I would actively seek out, and they come in a variety of sizes. I normally don't get excited about beer as wine or cocktails are my drinks of choice.  However, I felt differently after tasting the beers here.  I joined the UYE here last month, and I was impressed with everything about this place.  From the food, to the beer, to the service, it was a home run.\n\nI stuck with the 4 and 8 oz pours.  The 4 is great if you just want to taste something and are unsure.  The 8 is perfect for me to satisfy a craving for a particular beer.  I tasted many things I liked but my favorite was the Lil' Lady.  So tart, tangy, lemony, and refreshing which is my favorite style of beer. I also enjoyed the one that was brewed with spelt and guava, and also the experimental one with sushi rice and yuzu (Japanese citrus). I love the interesting combos going on here.  I usually only like sours, but Tired Hands proved me wrong!  \n\nService was excellent!  We had a big group of over ten Yelpers and water glasses were kept full and servers made sure we were able to order more beer when our glasses were running low.  It was also crazy crowded in there as it was a busy Saturday which made the level of service even more impressive.  In addition, the server has no problem giving our large group separate checks.\n\nThe Fermentaria serves up some tasty bar far as well.  I had a veggie burger and honestly wasn't expecting much, but it was very flavorful and the guacamole added some nice texture.  The bun was soft and fluffy (potato roll maybe?) and the fries appeared to be fresh cut.  It was a good sized portion, but not too much to where you push yourself to eat it and feel gross.  Just right!  \n\nI will most definitely return for the brews and the bites.  It looks like the draft choices are always changing, so I am excited to see what is available on my next visit!",

It can sometimes be fantastic and other times be unbearably bad. I understand that they get very busy, however, waiting after being seated for 45+ minutes on multiple occasions to give an order without being noticed is almost inexcusable. Additionally, after the food is brought to you, don't expect to see your server again until you're paying; only a handful of times have they actually come back to check on the food.

All of the staff was friendly and the drinks were strong but not too strong. I saw someone previously commented there was no coat check - if there wasn't one, there certainly is now. What I love most is the vibe. It is small and intimate downstairs with a neon theme and beer pong at the rear bar.

The clothing, etc. is ethically sourced and the shirts are super soft, love it. Can't wait to see what they create next. I'm a huge fan.

  "text": "This place was recommended by many and i have to say it was delicious. We went on a sunday around 7:30 and it was not busy at all, only 2 other tables. We were greeted by the most friendly waitress ever. She told us the specials and gave us a few moments to decide on what to order. After looking at the menu and trying to make a decision sonce everything looked so good I decided to get a ceasar salad and chicken napalitano. My boyfriend got the mussels in white sauce and veal parm. \n\nOur appitiZers were out in no time. The aroma fron the mussels was mouthwatering. There must have been more then 3 dozen mussles in the pot and there was enough sauce leftover to dip the crunchy seeded bread in. My ceasar salad was good, usual ceasar salad with crunchy crutons, not to much dressing.  \n\nThe chicken napalitano was amazing.  It was the most tender chicken breast with so much flavor. The mozzarella was so creamy and there was a piece of prosciutto between the chicken and cheese which gave the chicken a great flavor. There was this light tomato wine like sauce and the taste was to die for.  There tomatos were so plump and the artichokes were perfect.  The flavors all went so well together. \n\nI tasted the veal parm and that was also delicious. The red saice was so flavorful, the veal so tender and breaded perfectly.  \n\nOf course I had to get dessert. There is a book to look through with about 10 pictures. I wanted to choose a little piece of everything but I decided to get the chocolate chip cannoli. The waitress said her husband makes the filling and it is not to sweet and the perfect flavor. She was right. The cannoli shell had the perfect crisp and taste. The filling was the best i have had. It came bursting out of the shell and the cannolinis big enough for 2, although i ate all of it lol. After eating all the cannoli i wanted to get another one to bring it home. Perfect cannoli i have to say. \n\nI highly recommend this little resturant for great italian cuisine.  The staff is friendly, feels like you are eating at a relatives house. One downfall is cash only.",

It seems to have an echo due to the concrete floors and high ceiling.  We ordered the Antipasto Misto for starters. It was ok.  My husband had Farfalle Alla Milanese, he seemed to like it.  I thought it was nasty!! It had an overwhelming odor of pancetta (bacon.) It was weighed down with fatty heavy sauce.  Almost like they rendered out the fat from the pancetta and the sausage and used every drop to make the sauce. YUK!  I had the Pollo Alla Gino-Vese, it was pretty good.  Slightly over cooked and salty but over all it was good.  Mine also came with a side of spaghetti (which I did not eat.  It tasted canned.) Our server was super sweet! lol She even commented on my husband's dish.  She said that she hates serving it because the smell gags her.  We had a nice time there.  We did not leave hungry and our bill was $68 and we had drinks.  Not horrible but not amazing! PS... bring a sweater because it is down right COLD in there!!",

We were given a table by the fire and welcomed again by our waiter. It was restaurant week, so we selected our options that were paired with a special wine. We each had something different and each was delicious, especially the gnocchi for the first course. The second and third courses were even better: flat iron steak, pork chops or salmon, followed by desserts. Altogether, excellent food served by outstanding, attentive staff! The manager, Maggie, gave us a tour afterwards and told us the history of the inn. Just a wonderful experience! We'll be back!",

So, they come out extra light and fluffy, and the water expands them nicely. No butter or oils necessary! \n\nAnd, their eggs are locally-sourced from the River Hills Poultry Alliance. They're 'happy eggs', as they come from free-range chickens that are free of antibiotics and humanely raised. And yes, you CAN taste the difference.\n\nThey still make the meanest latte ever here, too! Try 'em.",

The \"Black Sheep\" of our particular units, we come together and enjoy some beverages and way better than expected food. Over the past few years, we've made some great memories here and I can honestly say that this place has the best burger I've tasted in a long time. The staff is always above average and takes care of us extremely well. We didn't get to meet the manager, but he also treated us much better than most establishments in the area. I'm not talking about a few guys either. We've shown up with a party of over 20 and they still were extremely accommodating and kept the premier service going. Almost didn't want to write this review because we like keeping it as our \"hidden gem\" of the area. I hope they make some more merchandise so we can represent when we're out of town!",

Of course, it is also close to Bourbon, and, with a couple stops for hurricanes and souvenirs, a little longer walk to Cafe du Monde and Frenchman Street.\n\nYou pay for parking and your car is valeted. \n\nIt could use some remodelling and service could be a touch friendlier.

  "text": "There's nothing like eating seafood on a pier on a gorgeous weekend!\n\nMy cousin raves about the spider crab here and I finally got the chance to go to SB (my first time) to try it! The line for the restaurant was insane during Saturday lunch! We put our name on the list and it would have been over an hour wait! We decided to order at the outdoor window instead and eat outside on the picnic tables which 1.had a shorter wait 2.had the same items 3. didn't have to tip which makes me sound cheap but you will thank me when you're paying for a 5 lb spider crab!\n\nWe got some meal deal that came with 2 clam chowders, 2 salads and we chose a 5 lb spider crab to share among 2 of us. I also ordered fries to get some carbs in there. And here's the verdict:\n\nFries: Could have passed. I feel like I could have bought some at the frozen aisle of the grocery store and had the same.\n\nClam Chowder: It was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but will definitely satisfy a clam chowder craving. Had a decent amount of clams.\n\nSalad: Nothing special - just a normal leafy green\n\nAnd the infamous Spider Crab: I felt like it was good, but not amazing. First, I thought they were gonna give ONE who giant 5lb crab but they give you 5lbs OF crab. The body comes on one plate and the rest of the legs that makes up the rest of the weight comes in another plate. The shell is really thick so I definitely recommend one of those shell cracker things. The crab meat tasted fresh and it was cooked well, but the meat was too dense for me. It wasn't marinated with any flavor so if you wanted some, you had to rely on the tiny cup of melted butter or the 2 slice of lemon they give you for the whole crab. \n\nOverall, it was okay. It's a lot of work, but you do get a lot of meat. I would recommend it if you want a seafood meal on the pier. At $9/lb, it's actually not that bad of a price, but each lb does add up.",

It's just like a Blaze or a Pie Five in \"style\" but with better ingredients. The dough and sauce are made in house.  You can make your pizza as healthy (or yummy) as you want it.    If you don't want the dough, then make up a salad.  And don't forget the breadsticks.   :-).  They are fresh baked, not just warmed up.  \nOne difference with the other made-to-order pizza places is that you pay per-topping.  But the base price is $5.  So, for a 4-topping pizza with a half order of breadsticks (3), and extra dipping sauce and a small drink (free refills) was $12.69.   Since I had left overs, that's a pretty good price for two meals!  \nThere is ample seating inside, with a mix of high and low top tables.",

However, there is only one dingy table outside AND, it's the target blasting area of some sort of restaurant ventilation so if you look cute, keep in mind that you will leave smelling like greasy french fries which makes you less cute.  \n\nDrinks are like $10 each.

Aside from the regular standards; great quality food on the amazing salad bar, large selection of tempting meats served, etc. this establishment sets itself apart from all the rest with the star quality waitstaff they have. Their employees, from the hostess to the gauchos were outstanding from the moment we walked in the door to the time they rolled us out of there (with dessert!) We arrived early for our reservation so we patiently waited in the comfortable and convenient patio area, had a couple drinks which were conveniently added to our bill, which we appreciated versus paying multiple times. We were seated and explained the procedure of the restaurant and then the fun began. Besides the delectable meal, all the friendly gauchos and our accommodating waitstaff really enhanced the whole experience as they tended to our every need and made us feel welcome and special. It was definitely a busy night and we could understand getting lost in the mix, but there was hardly a misstep throughout the night. A manager and the executive chef also came out to ensure everything was satisfactory. Awesome experience, I will definitely recommend to my friends and return again for our next celebration!",

I had my usual 1/2 pound burger (not stuffed) with all the trimmings plus jalapinos.  My wife had the 1/3 pounder.  We split one very generous serving of sweet potatoe fries.\n\nFirst of all, I'm not sure how they give you so much meat at their prices ( 4.99 for the regular 1/2 pounder and 3.99 for the 1/3 pound) with beef prices through the roof.  Anyway, the burgers are cooked exactly as ordered ( medium for me and well for my wife).  The fries looked a little over done but we're not at all.  Must just be that sweet potatoe fries come out darker than I expect.\n\nThe owner usually checks on satisfaction with the customer but I cannot \nimagine anyone having much of a beef ( no pun intended).\n\nOverall, a really great place for a burger.  I will never eat any of the fast food burgers again as long as J&D is open when I'm hungry for a \"cheeseburger in Paradise\" ( apologies to Jimmy Buffett)",

  "text": "Five stars for this location easily! Not sure why it took me so long to contribute to the reviews of this place, but better late than never. Everyone at this location is friendly and it's always sincere. Aside from having customer service that would shame some high end Philadelphia restaurants the food here is great. It is delivered efficiently, hot, and cooked properly. I personally am addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich and love to dip my fires in the Chick-fil-A Sauce. I also like that this location has family friendly nights: my favorite is taking my daughter to the annual father daughter date night around Valentine's. My little girl and I look forward to it - probably me more than her she is five and has no sense of time. I also really like their milk shakes and breakfast sandwich selections. Keep up the good work team Chick-fil-A, it isn't going unnoticed or unappreciated!",

First timer to Nola and wanted to try food they specialize in...alligator, gumbo, crawfish, etc. Had the fried alligator bites and crawfish but couldn't tell which ones were which. Po'boys were alright, nothing special for their high prices.\nOnly positive thing at this place was the live jazz. Loved the music.\nbtw they had 3 stalls in the ladies room but 2 of them were completely trashed and flooded.",

  "text": "This place was *mostly* great. Our room was spacious, clean, and better than expected. (This is by no means a luxury hotel, and that's fine, because I certainly didn't feel like paying for one.) The room had a king bed, a sofa bed, and plenty of room for two rollaway beds - which was perfect since we were cramming four adult men in there. I liked that there were two TVs and a fridge. Every staff member we interacted with was super helpful and friendly. It's located within walking distance of everything we wanted to do and see downtown. Our main attraction for the trip was a concert at the Bridgestone arena and having the ability to WALK there was a real plus. Overall, this hotel offers great bang for the buck.\n\nThat all said, I did have two gripes - both of which relate to security. First, even though there is a big sign at the front desk that says \"room keys will only be given to registered guests\", one of my friends who arrived late convinced someone at the front to give him a key to my room by providing only my last name and the room number. Certainly, in this particular situation, my friend getting a room key was fine, but I can easily imagine situations where giving out a room key based on name and room number alone would be a serious violation of security. What if my friend and I had just gotten into a fight and he was seeking revenge by stealing my things? Anyway, I feel strongly that the staff should never give out room keys without proper authorization.\n\nMy second gripe was that the hotel's wifi is unencrypted. In today's world, where people get hacked left and right, this is just unacceptable and neither I nor any of my friends used the wifi during our stay. No wifi at all is better than unencrypted connections which leaves guests vulnerable to hackers.",

  "text": "It's time to update my review since I wrote it back in 2017 (when they first opened). It's still 5 stars. Wish I could give it more after multiple visits and takeout orders. This is my favorite Thai restaurant. I love that they have a separate vegan menu with way more choices than any other restaurant. I'm not vegan, but I like the option and have found many wonderful items such as the eggplant basil stir fry, veggie spring rolls, and vegetable noodle soup. Everything they make is homemade including the sauces. There are no store bought sauces with added preservatives. They cook healthy and with lots of fresh veggies even in the regular menu items. They also don't skimp on the heat level. If you ask for it, you'll get it at whatever level you want. My husband won't go anywhere else but this place for Thai food. He's a Texan who loves spicy food. He gets his beef basil stir fry in Thai hot and absolutely loves it. He was actually the first person to recommend this restaurant to me. He happened to go there during one of my hospital visits. He said Preeda warned him of the spice level, and apparently was even impressed that he ate it all with no complaints. I asked him if it was Thai Boat. The previous restaurant that occupied that space (which was also good).  He corrected me and said that it's under new ownership and called Thai Legacy. We've been going ever since that time along with my mother.\n\nWe've been to all the other Thai restaurants in the area. They are all unique in their own way. I just like this one the best because of the variety. I've come to appreciate it even more after my recent visit to the Thai temple. I was drawn to the noodle soup and the flower teas at their Sunday market. I was craving that soup during the week so I pulled up the Thai Legacy menu and noticed that they have many variations of this soup on their menu. So far, I've had the pork noodle soup and the veggie one with tofu. The pork noodle soup has 4 different noodle options (small rice noodles, large rice noodles, yellow egg noodles, or clear bean noodles) and the veggie one has 3 types (no egg noodles). I got the clear bean noodles and asked for the spice tray on the side so that I could add my own heat. The takeout soup orders come with chili pepper spice, paste, and pickled jalapenos. It's a huge portion that can definitely be 2 meals or split between 2 people. It was so good, and reminded me of my morning at the Sunday market. It so comforting and I'm so happy that I can get it Tuesday thru Sunday when needed. I was also happy to see that they are now serving exotic iced teas such as Roselle Hibiscus, Butterfly Pea Flower, and Lemongrass tea. I've had the first 2 teas and they are refreshing. It's unlimited refills during lunch.\n\nThis restaurant gets better and better each time. It's a wonderful and hard-working family that owns it. They cook with love and health in mind. The service is always friendly and welcoming. They remember us every time we come in (especially my mother). We'll continue to return often.",

Luckily I had been twice before bad or would not have gone back.  The night it was bad I happened to take 2 people who have never been I felt horrible for raving how good it was as they won't be back.  I ordered the same item I had 2 weeks prior and it was awful.  Most likely the inconsistency is in whoever is the chef that day?  Overall I would say it is good but I do agree with the other reviews that it is not as good as when it first opened and it is a weak wine pour. Great Atmosphere and outdoor tables.  The service is good and staff friendly.  Their French Onion soup may be one of best ever had and a great bloody mary.  My lunches have been better then dinners.  Worth a try.  \nLarge groups - go elsewhere they do discourage groups especially at lunch. Place is to small and not set up to accommodate anything other than a prefix menu for a party over 6.",

I wish the portions were bigger since it was pretty expensive for something I could easily make at home.\n\nThe service wasn't my favorite part of the restaurant.

This place really gives you the feeling of comfy/cozy meal with family /friends, but with top-notch service... like having your own personal chef in your house. Mark (chef/owner) is great. The dishes are original enough that they are interesting, but stay true to the cuisine that the restaurant is based upon. \n\nPrepare to sit, relax and enjoy a fantastic dinner. I think my favorite aspect of this restaurant is the service. I never feel rushed. It drives me crazy when a server is delivering the next course when I'm not done the one before. Never the case here. I want to enjoy my company as much as I want to enjoy my dinner, which is the norm at Da Soli. \n\nSuggestions...\n\nApps: Grilled calamari, House-made sausage\n\nPasta: Gnudi Alla Genovese\n\nEntrees: Short ribs! My husband LOVED the veal\n\nDessert: rissoto/rice pudding and home made ice creams",

  "text": "Presentation of the Place: The Bathrooms are nice. It reminds you of  an overpriced hotel that you can feel fancy in while taking a dump. The inside of the place reminds me of an amalgamation of the sets of Cheers, Sex in the City, and some French Noir.\n\nThe Food: \n\nStarter:\n\nJumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs\n\nSo, this is the first of many dishes were the common complaint is the lack of salt in the food. From the egg, filling, and crab itself, everything was void of salt or seasoning except for what was a little paprika. The textures are boring and 1 dimensional. For 8 dollars, you are getting 3 deviled eggs at the lowest effort of innovation and care. It is something with less flavor and passion than the ones you are partaking in during Thanksgiving at your grandmas.\n\nBrussels Sprouts with Garlic Aioli and Grated Parmesan.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts are cooked exceptional well, which is rare. This is ruined, by the lack of salt and seasoning again. I assume this is due to the amount of Parmesan shaved on top of the dish. This gives the dish an overwhelming umami flavor, and it forces you to reach for the garlic aioli to counter it. After about 10 bites, you begin to realize how white you are because you are essentially eating cheese and mayo. \n\n\nEntrees:\n\nRatatouille with filet\n\nNo salt on the filet on top. No salt in the dish itself. What is on the Filet is a lot of balsamic vinegar, which is overpowering. The tomato paste hasn't been stewed long enough, so the dish is really acidic especially with the amount of balsamic vinegar being used.  \n\nQuail and Boudin\n\nThis dish is weird. If you ever had a fever dream and was wondering man I wish I could eat that, this is what it taste like. The portion of boudin and quail you get is actual small for the price. Guess what the quail doesn't have on it? The fry on the quail isn't good and the breading breaks offs. The chicken gumbo taste so strange like they almost put soy sauce in it and also has notes of sour. The boudin is really good and is the oasis in this odd dish. \n\n\nDrinks:\n\n1 Bottle of the Smith and Hook. Your standard Cabernet nothing flashy.\n \nService: \n\nI usually don't critique service. I understand that we all take breaks at work, but man no water refills, the restaurant isn't busy, and people from the pass are having to bring our food. This is happening while you and your bartender friend are talking the entire time. Not a good look hombre.  \n\nVerdict: A Salty No\n\nIf you want to have a glass of wine with the girls or boys, while you look out at Poydras St. I guess this is the place for you. In my opinion, there are far better options location and culinary wise for you to go to.",

I ordered a green chile lotaburger and onion rings.\n\nI was really disappointed in the burger. I got a single patty and maybe I should've gotten a double. The patty was thin and dry, not much meat on the burger at all. The bun was huge, way too much bread. They were generous with the toppings, but a burger should feature the meat. The green chiles had a nice kick. And the onion rings were decent. Three burgers, two drinks, and two orders of rings was just over $20. Maybe a tad pricey considering the drinks and rings were size small, and my mom got the little (itsa) burger.\n\nNo issues with the service. It was okay, not especially friendly. No real response from the cashier when we mentioned it was our first time either. If I come back, I may try the breakfast burritos and hope they're better than the burger.",

Then they overcharge the other services.  In addition, you have to wait for the students so the entire process takes about 3 hours.  They recommended that my dog have a tooth extracted ($2500) that eventually fell out on its own.  They will suggest procedures that are unethical, unnecessary and expensive. This is a DANGEROUS facility and they do unnecessary work at a very high price. DO NOT go here. Vet officials need to check this place out.

Came with basmati rice, too. \n\nEach item was so, so good. I split my keema samosa in half and tried the berry sauce on one side, and the spicy mint sauce on the other. Also drizzled some of the berry sauce on the shahi korma, hell yeah. \n\nWe have leftovers for tomorrow that I'm already looking forward to. \n\nI hope to order from Sher-e-Punjab again soon, and visit in-person when it's safe.",

  "text": "Hubs and I chose this place because it popped up on a YELP list of best places to watch football. YELP is absolutely WRONG about this. Walked in at noon on NFL Sunday, and two of the three bar big screens were tuned to soccer, one of the ancillary screens is tuned to soccer, and one of the ancillary screens is tuned to women's collegiate volleyball. The few screens tuned to football were tuned to the Titans, and I totally get that in Nashville, but when our server asked what game we wanted because she was willing to change the screen from volleyball, she said they couldn't do it because they don't have Sunday Ticket. This absolutely disqualifies Burger Republic as a football watching bar. Also, just putting a bunch of screens up around the place doesn't qualify it as a sports bar. Sight lines are important. Food was solid. Service was acceptable. But don't go here thinking you're going to watch football.",

  "text": "I'll summarize with these categories: \nFood - Very good. \nService - Very good but hurried. \nAtmosphere - DEAFENING noise. \n\nOur first visit was this Friday evening. I had heard rave reviews so we were anxious to try it out. We had reservations and were seated immediately. The place was absolutely jammed with people. The noise level was deafening. Having a conversation without raising your voice was impossible. The hustle and bustle of waitstaff going by every second does not make for a relaxing atmosphere. Too many tables jammed into this space. \n\nOur waitress was very good and attentive. However, we felt rushed. Probably because there were so many people waiting in the bar to be seated. \n\nThe food was very good. Mussel appetizer was just ok. Good quantity of mussels, but some were still closed. The sauce was tasty but lacked chunks of tomatoes. My crabmeat & shrimp over pasta was one of the best I've ever had. Dessert was also very good. Portions for all were more than enough. \n\nIf you want good food, visit Limocello. If you want a quiet evening or a relaxing atmosphere - STAY AWAY. Maybe weekdays are better. I'm sure they could do more to cut down on the noise. The ceilings are low, but the owner has placed acoustical tiles on the perimeter to reduce noise. Something else needs to be done. It's a shame because we couldn't wait to get out of there. I'm not sure I would go again.",

  "text": "The Natural Cafe is A-OK. Located on State Street, we stopped in here on a Friday afternoon as we were strolling down to the beach. It's order-at-the-counter, and there wasn't much of a line, so the wait was quick. I ordered the fish tacos (I'm from North Texas, so any excuse to eat fish in a coastal town I'm going to take). My boyfriend ordered the tuna fish sandwich with a side salad. My mom ordered the cup of vegetable soup, and my dad ordered the nachos. \n\nOnly my boyfriend was truly wowed by his food. If he were writing this review based on his experience of the food alone, I think he probably would give them 5 stars. He loved the sandwich and the salad, and I tasted both and have to say they were great. The rest of us were okay with our meals, but not all that impressed. My fish tacos were a little strange. They were smothered in tomato sauce and cheese, and topped with lots of shredded carrot. It wasn't bad, just a little odd. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips and salsa, which were pretty good. \n\nMy mom found her soup to be too salty, and the bread served with it tasted stale to her. My dad's nachos weren't too warm when they arrived, and quickly got cold as he ate them. He found it odd that there was so much salsa and no beans at all.\n\nOverall, not our favorite spot, but a good option for a healthy meal. The place has lots of vegetarian options, which is awesome. Come here for a sandwich and salad!",

  "text": "I really hate to update this review by knocking down a star, especially when I actually thought the food here was better than last time.\n\nUnfortunately, I had a bit of an uncomfortable experience.  I brought an individual here for a job interview of sorts, and this woman is a very high ranking individual in a very prominent government role here in Tucson.  To say this was an important lunch meeting doesn't even begin to cover it.\n\nI needed a lunch spot that would not only serve good food, but also have good service and appropriate atmosphere.  The food was pretty good.  The atmosphere... well, let me tell you what happened.\n\nI was greeted by a hostess, who was a very friendly young lady.  I requested my table, and she walked me to our booth.  However, I couldn't help but notice how short her skirt was.  I'm not 100, I wasn't raised particularly conservatively, and I'm enough of a feminist to believe that women should be judged on what they wear.\n\nBut I'm also a business woman.  And frankly, it was just plain inappropriate to wear that to work.  I thought \"oh honey, you don't need to wear that to get noticed\" but I was seated and honestly didn't give it a second thought.  \n\nAfter my colleague joined me, we started our meeting and everything progressed smoothly.  We were halfway through lunch when we noticed a different hostess sitting a table across from us.  This hostess too had on an EXTREMELY short skirt.  This time, it was so short that when she leaned over I could see... well, let's just leave at London and France.  \n\nSuper, super uncomfortable.  \n\nThe person I dined with, an incredibly professional woman, stopped mid-sentence, turned and looked at me.  I thought \"oh goodness, she's going to think I took her to a TD's rather than a respectable establishment!  She's going to try and sneak out before the \"floor show\" begins...\"  It was so awkward, all I could do was apologize.\n\nSo... apparently, Champs has decided to move into a new direction?  I once recommended this place as a good spot for a business lunch, but now I would never take another colleague here.  Or my husband, for that matter I guess.  I would worry he'd choke on whatever food he was served!  Champs, I'm not sure if you're trying to court a primarily male clientele who are too classy to go to a strip club for lunch, but it was awkward and frankly unprofessional.  I hope you will consider revising your dress code for staff. \n\nSome other notes... I didn't want to argue the bill with the server with my companion present, but I did give him a coupon before my guest had arrived which was not reflected on the bill.  I also noticed that I had gotten charged for an extra drink.  Not the end of the world, but it's those little details that reflect on a place.",

The server wished she was anywhere but here waiting on us.  I feel your pain it is hard to work for a living.  But if you are not a people person than maybe you need to sit in a cube somewhere and not waiting on people with your lousy attitude and pathetically slow to non existent service.  What saves this place from something less than 3 stars is the food was very good.  I had their steak sandwich..  It was very good.  Odd instead of one slice of steak it was pieces of steak placed on the bread.  I almost felt it was leftovers from the butcher shop.  But style or not the steak was very good.  It had a nice punch to it from the pepper they seasoned it with and the gardinaire it was served with.  The steak sandwich came with fries so I asked for some ketchup.  It came out in one of those little stainless steel cups that was about 25% full.  So after about 2 fries I needed more.  Good luck with that.  Refer to server section of the review. \n\nMy son The Famous Chip K. was with me anid told me he had this server before and she was bad.  Oh well.  So go for the food not the service.

  "text": "Since our experience was brunch, not the hotel itself, I hesitated to write this review. However, after reading the reviews of others, I feel our experience represents what others have said & felt so here goes. \n\nChristmas brunch: $75. We had no reservations & can now see why they weren't booked up.\n\nOnly soups were a gumbo & squash. Soup was tepid, soup \"bar\" messy. There was a large bread bar & I found a good yeasty roll. The gumbo was full of shrimp, sausage. (Later the waitress told me she could heat anything. That's nice but shouldn't be necessary.) The staff seemed overworked (we were initially led to the wrong table -- people were EATING there), but by & large tried really hard to accommodate. $75 included unlimited mimosas & my glass was never wanting. \n\nIt's hard to explain the worn, tired, outdated, rather unkept appearance. Like where we were finally seated along the wall, there were bumps in the carpet from electrical or whatever, but dust had accumulated. I even made the comment that I smelled moth balls. Hubby pointed to the, rather outdated in my opinion, cloth decorations on the tables/buffets. Made sense to me. \n\nHubby was delighted w/ the fresh oysters. Also the shrimp and crawfish. His omelette looked appetizing. Most desserts were to die for! The pralines were tasty but grainy and I've had better macaroons. My egg on artichoke was not properly cooked. The broccoli was hard, and too garlicky as was the cornbread stuffing. \n\nPictures are worth. . .",

Although it was very crowded, like all the restaurants in the French Quarter at noon, we got a table and good service. She didn't rush us, and it did not take too long to get our food. Unlike some of the comments below stating it was over priced, I found that to be the furthest from the truth. Seems to be everything was $12. The Po-Boys were HUGE! I shared one with my sister, and we could not finish it. My other sister ordered red beans and rice, which was very good, and another large portion, we all ended up sharing it. The burgers were also extremely large, at least 1/2 pound. The food was good, service was good, and they do not charge an automatic gratuity for 4 people. They have listed at the bottom of the bill a  gratuity calculation of 18% and 20% for your convenience. Perhaps it is for those people who stiff the server with a couple of bucks, or for people who cannot figure out what 20% of the cost is. I would recommend this restaurant.",

  "text": "I ate here for the first time when I visited Philly a couple weeks ago. It was my first BYOB experience and that was AWESOME! It's a really busy/crowded restaurant and we went for Brunch so there was no exception. Luckily my friend was able to call ahead to put our name in for a party of seven. We could track our spot on the waiting list through their text messaging system which was definitely convenient. By the time we made it to the restaurant there was only one party ahead of us. However, we still ended up waiting at least 45 minutes because it seems that there is limited seating for larger groups. \n\nWhen we finally got our table we immediately took our bottles out ready to get our drank on! The waitress opened our champagne bottle for us in the back and we ordered a couple juices to go with it. We also brought vodka, which went great with their delicious bloody mary mix. \n\nFor brunch, they had a TON of veggie options which was amazing!! The variety was great! They also have a \"Specials\" Menu which had the potential to be really cool, but it seems like it's just the same specials and regular recipes that they usually make where they just change the names of the items to a new theme. The food still looked pretty good though. \n\nI ordered the Ultimate Mexi Scramble. I was really excited about this dish as the description made it look delicious. I really enjoyed the black bean grits that came with the dish. The scramble itself was pretty good, but also a little bit too liquidy. The portion of food was large which was great because we were all starving after having waited to get a table for so long. The rest of my friends at the table seemed to really enjoy their food. \n\nI enjoyed my experience at Sabrina's Cafe for the most part. I really liked the BYOB policy. the food wasn't AMAZING in my opinion, but it was still pretty darn good. The only thing that was frustrating was the wait to actually get a table. It may be worth it for the restaurant to consider taking reservations for parties larger than 6.",

LOL!\n\nOf course, I wanted the mimosa tower for $69 (it's better for maybe 3 or more people). It was just my friend and I. She met me here (drove over an hour to Philly). We opted for the bottle of champagne w/ OJ $35. I got a shot of peach flavor to go with my mimosa. I enjoyed every drop and loved mixing in the OJ, champagne and peach! On point...delicious. \nBuzzzzzed! I ordered the hangover tots!!! I did not know I wanted this in my life! I loved this yummy,  hot mess, of a concoction! Friend is vegan and she enjoyed her meal too!\n\nMade reservations several days in advance for Sunday brunch on OpenTable. Outdoor seating was the only spots available (at the time)-- I snagged it! The reservations are a hot commodity I see. We were both running a bit late. There's a little bit of a grace period and the employees here were very accommodating to our delay. Customer service was good too!\n\nLove...this...spot...for...BRUNCH!",

Housekeeping only comes into the room to replace trash bags, we had all our trash in bags & they didn't take those, but no big deal. The kids enjoyed the pool, the hotel has a limit of 10 people in the pool area, due to COVID. \nOur only dislike was that there was some kind of error in the system & it charged my card even night for a random amount.

Salads were cold and crispy, servings were generous with lots of meat.  Their hot breadsticks are to die for!  The store we visited was almost empty inside, but the drive through was loaded up.  The inside was spotless with every other table marked off for distance.  Lots of disinfectant being used on tables.  This is perfect takeout for a real meal, instead of a burger.  Hubby had a slice of pizza as his side and the crust was great.  I took it away from him when he said he had more food than he could eat!",

  "text": "Ordered from this deli tonight on GrubHub. I'm from Philly, house sitting for my parents, and wanted to order something that felt like South Jersey to me. So, naturally, I get a hoagie. It was an arduous process deciding where to order from because I absolutely hate driving and delivery was a must. This spot had two great reviews for Indian food which sounded interesting to me, so I gave them a try.\n\nI ordered the American cold hoagie combo with chips and a soda and a 2pc samosa. I really didn't need all that food just for myself, but after seeing the reviews about indian food, I felt a little obligated to try something other than the sandwich. I received a call from a friendly woman after placing my order that they were out of chips and the soda I requested, so she was able to substitute fries and a different soda. She also asked how I wanted the hoagie - apparently if you order without specifying, it's literally just bread, meat, and cheese! Good to know. I told her to load it up with lettuce, onion, tomato, and extra mayo.\n\nThe food came much faster than grubhub estimated. I had indicated contactless pickup, but the delivery guy still came to the door and waited for me to answer to hand off the food. He was super friendly as well, so I didn't mind. I just felt bad that I hadn't grabbed a mask before answering the door because I thought he would have put the food down and stepped away. I'm really not used to people being so friendly, haha. Philly is the city of brotherly love and all, but we are antisocial and don't like to make eye contact. This was different. \n\nThe samosas were delicious. I've never had one before so I didn't have any expectations. The green sauce smelled spicy so I used the brown sauce for dipping and I think there was cinnamon in there? I liked the crunch. It was like an Indian perogi with tons of flavor.\n\nThe hoagie was okay! Not the best hoagie I have ever had in my life, but certainly not the worst and still better than wawa. I added more mayo from my fridge. It just didn't taste like it was made with the same love as the samosas, or maybe I was so impressed with the samosas that the hoagie seemed bland? Hmm.\n\nThe fries were perfect. Super crisp and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Absolutely perfect fries for my taste.\n\nI was super full after eating everything but half the sandwich, but I am satisfied. I would definitely recommend this spot and/or try some more indian dishes if I am ever in the area with a hankering again.",

However, they have a LOT of terrific basics, casual clothing, and mix-and-match pieces that are very reasonably priced,  and their sale rack is a dream. They have a fantastic selection of shoes, belts, and handbags that I haven't seen anywhere else. The jewelry offerings look to be carefully curated, and there are very cute pieces in a wide range of prices. \n\nThey also have a fine selection of books and greeting cards, and a fine selection of musical instruments, to boot. \n\nI don't live in Nashville, but I'm frequently here on business, and this shop will become a regular destination whenever I visit.",

Tater tots were ok but the jambalaya was delicious!!\nWife had the smoked turkey sandwich that was very moist with a wonderful light smoked flavor.\nDaughter-in-law had the pulled pork sandwich, loaded tater tots and beans. Very tasty pork! This coming from someone who has eaten plenty of pork of the past 20 years in NC. The beans, mixed variety, were seasoned nicely. Could have cooked them a few minutes longer though.\nIf you go at lunch expect to wait and share a bench table with other patrons.

Its parking lot desperately needs to be repainted as there are parking spots on one side of the building that really isn't wide enough to hold parking plus the traffic of cars actually driving by.\n\nThe food is really good. I've had their chicken biscuit a number of times, and find it is better than many other fast food establishments. It is many times better than McDonald's and Burger King and is just as good, if not slightly better, than Chick-fil-A's.\n\nTheir hash browns are nicely seasoned, with some different herbs included, and are very good if they are fresh and hot. Once they've sat for more than a few minutes, they become soggy and unappetizing.\n\nThey have a huge variety of donuts and are constantly rotating different seasonal specials. The donuts are generally fresh although I've gotten a stale donut or two whenever I run by during the late evening.\n\nThe service is friendly, although it is slow! If I place an order inside, they will do three or four cars before finally handing me my order. I dislike that the emphasis is placed on people in the drive-thru, and wish they would have dedicated staff for both sides.",

I can't remember the name of the other dish we ordered, but it was basically seasoned cauliflower, onions, and potatoes. The cauliflower dish was good, but not as seasoned and flavorful as in other Indian restaurants I've been to. We enjoyed everything overall. Our waitress was polite and helpful. We will definitely return. A lot of people appeared to also pickup takeout orders from the restaurant, so that's always an option if you don't want to dine in.",

  "text": "This location has a very easy drive-thru (easy to navigate). However, it was pouring rain when my fiance and I ordered at the drive-thru. Because they did not have an awning or something to block the rain from coming down, I could BARELY hear the drive-thru operator through the speaker. I was straining super hard to hear (and my fiance is almost deaf in one ear so he DEFINITELY could not hear). \n\nWe ordered the pretzel burger sandwich, 4 count of chicken nuggets with honey mustard, a medium Sprite, large fries, medium Diet Pepsi, 8 count of mozzarella sticks, and an order of chicken fries with barbecue sauce.\n\nI see chicken tenders on the menu which is what my fiance wanted to order (although it said 2 count of chicken tenders but he wanted four) and the drive-thru operator said \"Do you mean the nuggets? We don't have chicken tenders\". And we were like \"...No... the tenders...\" and again she said that they didn't have those, so I was confused about that. (Unless she meant they didn't have any left in stock??) \n\nAs for the parking lot: Once you collect your food from the drive-thru window, they only have parking spots available for handicap people to park, and you're only able to turn right out of the lot. If you wanted to eat in the parking lot, you'd have to basically do a square around the corner to come back into their parking lot again.\n\nAs for the food: My fiance liked the pretzel sandwich. They unfortunately did not give him any honey mustard like what he wanted for the chicken nuggets (so he ate those plain). I was pleasantly surprised to see how big a medium drink is (it's definitely like a large in my eyes!) I'm so used to diet drinks that it should taste fairly normal, but my Diet Pepsi tasted different this time, and not in a good way, I don't know... They forgot to give us marinara sauce (which is pictured in the promo for the sticks), so we ate them plain. Finally, my chicken fries were okay, they give more than what I was expecting in the box, but I just felt that they lacked flavor. They didn't taste like anything to be honest... I had a couple of my fiance's fries and those tasted good.",

The mac and cheese was really good, I'd get that again.

This was my first visit here, but what I really liked was that the servers didn't make you feel bad about asking for a sample of several different ice creams before making a decision. The flavors are so odd that you have to try them to fully appreciate their flavor.

I would honestly get a comment every time I left her chair!  I first started going here because I could schedule everything online (major bonus points) and I kept going because of the quick, efficient and excellent results.\n\nI recently went back to the salon and saw Lori, who is new to this salon but who has done hair for years and was previously an instructor.  She was EXCELLENT.  She saw that I hadn't been to a salon in awhile and instantly knew how to fix my color.  I wanted to go a little more natural, after having gone a little too blonde at the last appointment.  She explained the process in the beginning, then as we went through the color and cut, she continued to explain what she was doing and why.  The result?  Best color I've had in... maybe ever.  She put on a glaze to help fix some of my highlights, which had faded, at no extra charge, too.  I highly recommend her to any girl with highlights, especially if one's is in need of some help/corrective color or wants a change to the status quo.",

The restaurant was busy and crowded and the service was nice and attentive.  One thing that we didn't enjoy too much (nothing against the restaurant itself) was this party of women across the room from us, and I swear one of the women had a laugh similar to a witch's cackle.  It was hard to enjoy our dinner when she was going off every 5 minutes.  No hard feelings for people enjoying their own dinners and having a good time but I wish they were more mindful of being inside around others.\n\nWe had the crispy Brussels sprouts to begin and they were roasted to perfection.  We shared the slow cooked oxtail ragout with a side of the baked jalapeno cheesy grits.  All of the food was so good.  The oxtail was tender and the grits were also so tasty.  I would come here again to try other items off of the menu for sure.",

  "text": "Worst 3-star+ hotel experience of my life.  My company was there Tues-Fri for a conference, I paid fir 7 rooms for my team.  1 room had barely been cleaned, with trash still in the room & pubes on toilet.  1st nite our 2000 person conference had a welcome party at Falls Bar.  2 bartenders. The bar manager stood around doing nothing, while lines stacked up.  After waiting 45 minutes for a drink with no progress we, like hundreds of others, left.  The rest of the bars/restaurants were either closed or closed early (at 10ish) leaving everyone to go off site to extend any client entertainment.  You can only blame Covid for so long-pay damn bartenders $100/hr and you still make money (a lot!). During the day, you basically had the pizza restaurant (decent and guy from Egypt forget name was nice & wonderful), the convenience store (long lines) or the Cascade restaurant buffet, WAY overpriced & mediocre at best.  The Steakhouse was the only fining highlight--good value on wine list-but when you pay $1200 (8 of us) it better be good.  At $100/nt it would be average-at $200+ simply unacceptable (and over $10k for my team). I called the Spa on Tues to ask if they had a steam room and they said yes, but failed to tell me it was 'Closed due to Covid' WTF! And only open 9am-430p (during our conference???) so no way to steam anyway when I wanted to at 7a or 5p.  Upon arrival we were talking about coming back for our Spring conference-by end of week we decided Motel 6 would be a better option in Nashville.  Again, tired of the 'Covid Excuse'. Completely unacceptable",

I got a delicious cocktail and my friend and I split the 5 option charcuterie board. We were able to choose 5 options of a list of cheese and meats. The board also came with a healthy portion of grapes, champagne onions, honey, mustard, pickled green beans, and of course bread!

Sometimes we just don't take advantage of the things that are right in our own backyard (figure of speech.. this was just a few blocks away).\n\nAfter the disappointment of having an hours' delay in judging... the actual judging was fun.  Of course, it was pretty fast-paced eating.  15 wings in roughly 45 minutes is some serious heartburn waiting to happen... no matter how good the wings were.  While I enjoyed many of the flavors offered during our 4 PM tasting, I;m sad to say nothing jumped out to say \"you gotta get some of this.\"  Maybe that was in the earlier or later tastings.  I should say, that nothing was awful... they were all good, except the last two options...14 was HOT, 15 was SUPER HOT.. took one bite and put it down.  Although I did hear about a maple/bacon flavored wing (I didn't get this one).  Would I do it again.... absolutely.  A shaded place to sit under a tent, nice an comfortable, plenty of wings, water, and a couple of drink coupons to boot.  How can you go wrong.\n\nDuring the delay... what could you do.. go home or go into the casino... really what was the option.  Thanks for the delay.. I'm $300 richer (thanks Eldorado).\n\nSo get out there fellow Reno\"ites\"... live music, good eating, and the being part of the community.

Once this event is over and in between the many events held during the summer... come on down, the river is flowing and there are pool areas for swimming, check our our new bridge, check out the shops in The Underground (old Post Office), and check out all the new local restaurants, and there are quite a few top notch restaurants in the Eldorado, Silver Legacy (host of the Wing Fest) and even Circus Circus.",

  "text": "We really, REALLY want to love this place but after two visits the odds are not in its favor. Since it's owned by the folks who brought us 1111 Mississippi and Vin de Set, we had high expectations but this place falls down on the little things--which many of the reviewers have noted. After the first (meh!) visit we thought it was a fluke. But 0 for 2?; shame on me if I make it 3. I think it shows how hard it is to consistently deliver a quality pie and we should appreciate even more those (few!) places in The Lou that do so.\n\nFirst the good: the interior is (mostly) awesome. Exposed brick, open kitchen, halfway between warehouse and loft space. Folks from Boston will love it! The sausage: house made fennel sausage! Awesome. The red sauce: exquisite! Just the right balance of sweet and hot (arrabiata). Loved it! The thin crust is crispy with nice bubbling, not sweet. A total absence of provel makes this a love it or hate it kinda place--depending on how you like your pie.\n\nThe bad: the lighting! This requires a serious overhaul. Can lights placed where they do no good; halogen spots shine in your eyes. Good luck reading a menu, spotting your waiter, or enjoying the sights. Go during the day if you can! The A/C will blow you out of the place. I realize this is to balance the heat put out by the gas ovens in the open kitchen but yeesh! Bring a sweater or hoodie. You'll need one!\n\nFirst time, we ordered The Wolf. Very greasy to the point of soggy. Second time, half Hawaii Five-O; half sausage, onion, mushrooms. They added the mushrooms after the pizza was cooked. They were still cold! Ordered iced tea but had to ask for sweeteners (none on table). Iced tea was off tasting and sent it back for a pear cider.\n\nMy recommendations: retool the interior with an eye toward better, user-friendly lighting and overhaul the menu in favor of a simple, quality product. The pretentions to be a gourmet pizza restaurant just aren't carried through in the uneven service and iffy food. \n\nIf I'm halfway between a Dewey's and PW's guess which direction I'll be headed?",

  "text": "I was a bit skeptical of this place from the moment it opened. One: the location seems odd to me but maybe it's because I rarely make my way to Marathon Motor village during the day time. Two: the theme. Many Nashville restaurants take advantage of garage-style doors and even have similar themes. The difference? They do it well. Garage coffee company felt more like I was there to get my oil changed than to get a solid cup of coffee. It felt like it was trying to cater a crowd that's non-existent in the Nashville coffee scene. \n\nI often tell people that I have two criteria for liking a coffee shop and it only needs to meet one of them. A) Have a great environment or B) serve a really good product. Garage does neither. Their coffee is  equivalent to a cup you may get at Starbucks, possibly even worse. Sorry, folks.",

  "text": "This restaurant review is really only about the Happy Hour.  Lately, that has been my MO.  In the summer I don't like to eat huge meals so Happy Hours work great.  It's really hard to judge a restaurant correctly this way.  So guys, just remember this was a Happy Hour review and doesn't reflect their true menu.  Went there Friday night with our friends.  It was the four of us all looking to share some delectables.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite make it for us.  We shared the Calamari which was fried but came dry without a sauce, no lemon.  It was tasty but I believe could have been better.  Also the smash burger.  I couldn't understand why they called it that.  Except that is a new term for a trend in burgers these days.  Since one is opening up in town with just that name (Smash Burger) on Grant and Swan.The burger was very plain and tasteless.  Also ordered the Mahi tacos which just got a so so for us.  The highlight was the fish and chips.  Actually, the fish was made to perfection.  Crispy, dry on the outside with a beautiful white fish inside.  I'd highly recommend that.  The fries were very plain and ordinary to say the least.  Ordered the salad on the happy hour and it was totally bland. I would come back just for the fish and disregard the chips. The service was fine.  We had a lovely, cheery server.  The place is trendy and quite lovely with the views of the mountains.  By the time we left the place was hopping mostly at the bar.  It is definitely worthwhile going to.  I love to see Restaurants do well here in Tucson. I will be back.  I'm not trying to bad mouth this place but  because I am an honest reviewer I might be coming off a little harsh.   I will be back and get the fish and try some other interesting dishes.  They do have an extensive selection of Happy Hour dishes.  Even more than other restaurants.  So certainly it is worth coming here and enjoying this trendy spot.",

I've always found the service to be decent, and the food quality is on par with other quick-serve Mexican fast food restaurants of its kind.

The rolls are slightly oversauced but plentiful in type. There is not green tea or red bean ice cream machine, but they do have vanilla and a dessert bar.

I did not try this, so I can't comment on the taste.\n\nI do recommend the Shabu-Shabu- you tell your server and he/she brings a pot of clams (soup base) to your table. You can pick your choice of meat, seafood and veggies and bring it to your table to cook. Their shabu shabu sauce is tasty. \n\n3 stars is just about right if you choose wisely.",

We started with the sriracha guacamole (YUM) and the loaded queso (it had bacon in it) and both were very tasty.  For my meal I had the grilled avocado (filled with fresh ahi tuna and crema sauce) and the Mexican street corn.  The ahi tuna was SO incredibly fresh and the avocado was just perfect - highly recommend this dish.  The Mexican street corn was also very well done and quite scrumptious!

  "text": "As if the appeal that Drake and Beyoncé stay here when they are in town wasn't enough, The Hutton Hotel in Tennessee captures the essence of luxury and excellent customer service. Upon entering I was greeted with an amazing staff and a free glass of wine. My concierge and staff was accessible by a text message and they were more than accommodating to my every need. The Hutton is also very environmentally friendly, all electricity in your room is accessed through your key card. The room is amazing overlooking the beautiful Tennessee streets, The Hutton is placed perfectly on Broadway, and is not too far away from the bars and restaurants. The ambiance of the room is stellar and creates an environment that makes you feel comfortable and at home. I never wanted to leave and at 21 years I'm considering saving up enough money just to stay here one more night. By far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had, I wish I was able to give more than 5 stars.",

  "text": "Went to Taco Bell on Pyramid Hwy across from Savemart in Spanish Springs tonight. Placed our order at 7:25pm. At about 7:35pm I asked to speak with the manager. I was informed she was busy by the guy up front. He refused to go back and let her know I wanted to speak with her. After watching several other people get there food some with extra food for the delayed service and some with just getting what they ordered our order finally came up at 7:52pm. That is a 27 minute wait for fast food. I asked again to speak to the manager. She told the gentleman who brought our food up she couldn't talk and to handle it. He informed me he was a shift leader and how could he help. I said I want to speak with the manager. When he told her she said I'd have to wait. I said there was no waiting and she could speak with me then. I started to speak and she interrupted. I told her to let me finish. My question was why was no one told in the dining room for eat in or carry out told of a long wait time and how would this be corrected? Brie  (the manager) informed me she could refund me my money. I told her I was not looking for a refund but an explanation as to why no one was told of an extended wait. She said corporate never said they had too and that there were large orders being placed inside and through the drive thru. I said that is ridiculous and that all customers should matter. The rudeness I recieved from the moment we walked in to the moment we left has left such a disgusted taste in my mouth that WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!! Corporate you need to change your management team and team members and  be there to show them what CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!!!",

They didn't have dijon or brown mustard, which I found odd for a gourmet burger place. I'm also not so sure why they're using chopped iceburg lettuce on the burger since chopped lettuce creates a serious bun slippage problem. Overall, it's a good burger, but it could be so much better with a few changes. My wife did like the fact that the \"Snack Burger\" is perfect in size for her rather small appetite, and it's only $4 so that's a plus.",

  "text": "If it were in Virginia, it'd be VA-Chinatown. And I'd come here even more. So to speak.\n\nOne thing I am certain of, is that it's more exciting that the largest city in Saskatchewan. Without doubt, you're better off in Chinatown than Reginatown.\n\nPhiladelphia has a beautiful Chinatown with little alleys and a crisscross of roads that reminds me a little bit of a slightly larger Boston Chinatown, and it's significantly better than the one in DC, but what isn't.\n\nIt's a traditional Chinatown with a big gate right in the heart of the city, which makes for a great tourist attraction. There is some really great Boba around here too, as well as some not-so-good Boba.\n\nBut I would say some of the best Boba in the Philly area is within 4 blocks of this gate, and there's plenty of amazing food located right here in Chinatown, which makes it a real destination for us, and we like it. Parking is an issue though, like at your mother's place.\n\nFor Boba try Mr Wish, KFT, Mr Camp, Tsaocaa, Tea Do (open later), and more.\n\nMy old review said:\n\nA lot of people think of NYC and San Francisco as the Chinatowns of the USA. But cities like Boston, DC, Houston and Philadelphia have wonderful Chinatowns of their own, complete with the \"gate\" and all.\n\nThe Philly Chinatown is much smaller and less-frequented than the one in NYC, but it's absolutely wonderful. It's mainly just 1 street, although technically it's several square blocks. The one street is like being in China itself, but in a Philly terraced row-houses neighbourhood setting. There's a little of everything, and if you like Chinese food and goods, you'll never get tired. There are some nice dessert and bubble tea shops along here too.\n\nPerhaps the best part is that Chinatown Philly is close to everything. It's about 10 minutes walk from the Liberty Bell and 5 minutes walk from Reading Terminal Market, which has much of the best food in town. It's one of the most notable and enjoyable little Chinese neighborhoods in North America.\n\nSo if you feel saddened or down\nI know just what will erase your frown\nWe'll both strip down naked\nSteal a car, and take it\nOut joyriding in Chinatown.",

It's a nice outdoor setting, if the weather is fine. 101 Freeway is right there, so that can be a bit noisy.\n\nThe kids behind the counter are fast, efficient and helpful. Lots of smiles.\n\nMy only gripe is that some people allow their kids to run around, with noticeably little to no supervision. We were having a really nice lunch, until a little girl (definitely old enough to know better) wouldn't let up on chasing birds. Around and around she went, terrorizing the birds.  Mommy didn't even look up. \n\nThe sandbox is a nice feature, and I noticed kids making new friends, which was sweet.",

Also, given how generous they are with toppings with the Blues City dog, I'd choose this place over plenty other hot dog spots.\n\nEither way, when deciding to come here, always plan for a spot to eat at once you get your food.

  "text": "Close this review right now and start driving to The Shoppes at New Tampa.  Leave regret in your rearview mirror and don't EVER question your decision to drive the extra 17 minutes to Asian Buffet. \n\nSure it's going to cost $1 more, but that's what it takes to avoid the deep sadness I'm feeling right now.  The differences between a $7.99 and $8.99 experience are astounding:\n\nFor starters, eating in a poorly planned cafeteria setting with power cords all over the walls and very misleading food images posted in the windows as you enter VS a modest exterior and an immediate eyeful of a buffet that punches you in the face with possibilities before you're brought to one of three separate dining areas.\n\nSecondly, taking a first plate that already feels like you've settled for disappointment and shouda, woulda, coulda's VS a first plate that hasn't even scratched the surface of what looked delicious.\n\nThird, did I mention how sad I am right now??\n\nFourth, 2 servers, 1 hibachi/sushi chef and 1 buffet attendant VS more staff than you can shake a stick at.  Don't get me wrong, this place has really nice servers but something has to make up for the stingy buffet tables they can't afford to even keep half full...\n\n...and that's where I'll finish this up.  Compared to Asian Buffet, this place is a food desert and I had to fight through a scattered mess of fried or cheese covered insanity to find anything remotely Asian and/or healthy.  The move by places like this to cheapen their culinary culture to feed a bunch of fat Americans more calories than Asians will consume in a week is disgusting on so many levels.  I guess if you throw enough gawdy neon lights in a place and slap up a fish tank I'm supposed to be impressed by your exotic oriental heritage???\n\nI'm over it.  The only thing Imperial here is the amount of failure they managed to pack into a single hour of my life!",

The special includes your choice of a fried yummy treat and soup.  I ordered the moo goo gai pan with crab rangoons and egg drop soup.  This combo is one of my personal faves.  I can eat it every day.  I have to say though, this isn't THE best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's freak'n pretty close.  And for the cost of this meal... $13.00!!!  Yup!\n\nOne thing I must mention that I wasn't pleased with was the service.  Our server needs to step up her game.  \n\nBc this place is new, it's much nicer then it's sister restaurant.  They Prytania location needs some updating with the decor fo sho.  I usually either pick up my order or have it delivered but still the atmosphere and decor is old school.",

  "text": "Sunday Jazz Brunch\nBBQ Shrimp\nBloody Mary\n\nBased on a recommendation by a local store owner, we squeezed Mr. B's Bistro into our NOLA foodie sojourn.  It wasn't difficult really, as yelper Chris T. says, because I called the afternoon before and getting into Sunday Brunch was eezy peezy.  Definitely nothing like getting into Commander's Palace...(yea, I'm a little bitter about being turned away for not having a lunch reservation and making the $14 cab ride over)\n\nThe band for Sunday brunch was great; they took requests and were talented for what we've thus seen.  And though the layout of Mr. B's makes it seem like there are 'no good seats in the house', the band travels around sections of the restaurant.  What a treat! \n\nNow, the food and the cocktail were delicious.  Then, why did I give them 3 stars???!!!  The BBQ shrimp sauce was a little too salty for me and the shrimp a little overdone (peel and eat shrimp).  My boyfriend was impressed with it and it was his choice dish, so I could understand his tasty review.  However, my other thought was, I can't believe this costs $22/$28(?)!  Likewise, my little Bloody Mary was $6...we had a Bloody Mary twice the size at Bourbon House later that day (maybe not as well made).  \n\nMind you, I realized that we lucked out this weekend on being present during Restaurant Week and I'm sure I got sucked into believing the lower prices exist everywhere in NOLA...\n\nBut, Mr. B's was not worth the $$$ to me.  The service was just fine and the food as well...Perhaps, I'm not a believer of Dickie Brennan establishments...",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I were at Indeblue this Wednesday, and I am happy to say that this neo Indian (I like to call it food with a contemporary classicist flair) restaurant did not disappoint and impressed our hungry stomachs. I was compelled to make an instant comparison with Tashan on several levels.\nWhat stood out immediately was the decor while we were being led into the restaurant...Indian motifs with a modern flair, again reminiscent of Tashan perhaps..but it certainly had its  unique appeal. The location of Indeblue in my mind will be key to its success. Tashan feels a tad far out for the likes of us that like to sip and hang around the Walnut/Chestnut to South St. types of locales.\nThe menu does not disappoint either- they have a great spread of appetizers, entrees, veggie options and naans. The cocktail list looked like a cheery collection of Inde-Bollywood style names and fun flavors. We got the Bollywood sparkler (?) and the Chai tea sangria. The chai tasted better than Bollywood sparkler (this tasted too bubbly/frizzy for me) - the sangria was light and had hints of chai and brandy- a great combo to get a pitcher of, though it didn't sound appetizing in its description.\nThe service was worthy of nothing. Well informed servers that were good with suggestions. Don't get me wrong.. I am perfectly capable of choosing my tikkas, naans and rasams but given that the menu had an obvious personal flair of the chefs cooking style, it always helps to see how keen the chef is on informing the staff on his/her offerings. \nTo start we had the long hots and the crispy veg. chilli- to me a rendition of the stuffed long green chillies and the Indo-Chinese Hakka noodles. The paneer mozzarella combo in the green chillies were perfect-creamy, the chillies added bite and the tangy tomato sauce rounded the flavour off. The veg chilli had zucchinis in it (which I found interesting) but was a good subtle complement to the bold/spicy sauce (more gravy than sauce). The veggies had not lost their crunch despite the sauce on the noodles. To those familiar with Indo-Chinese food-the addition of the 3 side sauces (vinegar w/ green chillies, green chilli sauce and soy) completed my experience of eating this glamorized version of hakka noodles. spot on!!\nFor the main course, we had a meat and a veg option. Both were superb in their portion sizes, taste, flavour. We ordered the stuffed squash (this came with saffron rice) and osso bucco pork vindaloo. \nThe meat dish came with bone in which was perfect, the meat was melt in your mouth worthy cooked. It was a great meat, potatoes and gravy dish that is typically comfort food for me.  The vindaloo gravy did not have the pungency of vinegar that I seek, but completed the dish just fine.  I can see how an overpowering amount of vinegar can turn customers away from this dish. The garlic naan was fresh, however I am not sure if it was made in a tandoor or sigri, and I could taste uncooked flour in some parts of the bread- I chose to overlook this. The stuffed squash in my girlfriend's words- it was creamy (perhaps slightly excessively so) but very tasty, very well cooked, could have had a hint bit more of spice but she enjoyed it overall. If this was a take on \"malai kofta\" it was certainly well executed.\nOverall, I would go back and recommend it to others. Chef Rakesh Ramola certainly had the right idea with opening IndeBlue here in Philly. The prices could be comparable to Tashan, the food is just as good as Tashan's Chef Shende and Chef Senat. Where it beats Tashan is the location and the restaurant size. The location is always popping (regardless of weather or economic paucity), the place's size will make certain that it looks full even on days where only a few occupy the bar and tables- a definite draw for guests to peer in.",

The edamame was typical nothing special there. The shrimp shumai was good. They were like little shrimp purses. \n\nNext we tried the bon bon tacos and bonzilla sushi burrito. The tacos were decent but we felt they needed something to give it a kick of spice. The bonzilla burrito was pretty awesome. Its has spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, and cucumber with a few sauces to give it great flavors. This was definitely the best thing we tried.\n\nLastly we got a few sushi rolls. Philadelphia, spicy tuna, and chicken tempura. The rolls were fresh but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nAll and all, I would definitely go back for the sushi burritos. Amazing concept and excellent execution.

While checking in,  there was a notice that housekeeping services would only be every 4th day.  While I don't really care about having my room cleaned, I'm no slob and I only slept there, I did want my bed made daily (not sheets changed, just made) and I meant to mention it to the clerk.  Unfortunately, by the time I got to the desk, I forgot and no one brought it up. \n\nLater that afternoon, after my meetings concluded and I had a chance to shower, I called down to the front desk to request that my bed be made.  I was told, in no uncertain terms that they would not accommodate my request because of the Pandemic (of course there is no evidence of transmission from soft surfaces like cloth or why would they ask us to wear face coverings?)\n\nThe next day, while in meetings, I found out that one of my colleagues was getting daily service so that afternoon I called to speak to a manager.  He told me that it was too late in the day to get it done but he would have it done the next day.  Since it was mid-afternoon, I replied that was unacceptable, I had asked for the service the day before and was lied to that it wasn't available and I expected it today, he refused stating housekeeping had already assigned the rooms for the day.  After getting off the phone I stepped out of my room and ran into a housekeeper.  I asked her, she checked with her boss and amazingly, they were able to accommodate me.  \n\nNot only did the desk manager not even try to accommodate me, but he also failed to have the service set up for the following day.  This was an epic service failure that I would expect from a mom and pop.  I've received better service from Best Westerns.  I would never stay here by choice.",

  "text": "Your typical tourist trap at the end of the pier with mediocre food, service and good views. 2.75 Stars. \n\nFirst, as with any tourist trap, be prepared to wait. There is very little shade if it's a hot day so keep that in mind. The actual restaurant doesn't have that much seating either so even if there aren't too many people, chances are it will still be at full capacity. \n\nThe service was mostly adequate. Had to try hard to get their attention a few times and they weren't very attentive and never cleared our plates despite barely having any room for them. \n\nThe food was... disappointing. We had the local crab, baked garlic clams, pasta with clams, and the uni (sea urchin) with scallops. \n\nThe crab was just OK. It's definitely no King Crab but it isn't even close to Dungeness Crab either. Ironically, didn't taste all that fresh. It was easy to get the meat out so there's that.\n\nThe baked garlic clams were probably the best dish. They were packed full of flavor and I'm sure the breadcrumbs, garlic, and Parmesan helped cover any imperfections and possible lack of freshness.\n\nThe clam pasta was... atrocious. I've had better pasta from frozen microwave dinners. Calling this pasta is offensive to Italians! Needless to say, we only ate the seafood and left 90% of the \"pasta\" untouched.\n\nThe biggest disappointment, however, was the uni with scallops. The scallops were actually pretty decent. Barely noticeable mild oceany flavor. The uni was.... come on! This is Santa Barbara Uni in Santa Barbara. Shouldn't get any fresher than this... but unfortunately it does. Sure, it was creamy and sweet but it was just off.\n\nBut hey, maybe you come here for the amazing views! Which, mostly they are. But the inside seating with the dirty windows leaves you with less than a stellar views. It didn't help that the seafood smell was mixed in with smell of what I would assume was bleach or some other cleaning material. The outside view is great, expect for when it's a warm day and you are cooking harder than your dishes.\n\nOverall, I'd skip this place. There are much better seafood restaurants in the area.",

Wait was decent. \n\nCame here during a November weekend and really enjoyed the food. Grabbed food to-go since the dine in wait was long and sat at the near by tables on the pier. Tried: uni+scallop, clam chowder, lobster bisque, their local box crab, and lobster roll. All food was really fresh and left me wanting more even though I was stuffed! On another visit, I tried calling beforehand to see what fresh seafood options were still available for the day, but it seemed that they were busy and let the phone ring unfortunately. \n\nWould recommend to those visiting Santa Barbara!",

  "text": "My first experience here was just grabbing a slice of pepperoni during Mardi Gras.  It was so good that I just couldn't wait to go back there.  When I finally did they gave me a free order of garlic knots just to try out with my slice of pepperoni pizza.  Since then Epic has been a staple on my list of go to-pizza places.  Their pizza really is that good.  The garlic knots themselves are delectable and my wife fell in love with them.   They're also directly next door to I-tap, probably the best draft beer bar in St. Louis.  \n\nThat said...the service at Epic has dropped with each subsequent service.  We've always explained that we were planning to eat at I-tap and this initially was not a problem.  They would always bring it right over to us.  Now we've been dealing with an older male, not sure of his name, who is very gruff and short.  He seems annoyed just by your presence in the establishment, especially once you mention I-tap.  However usually a woman, in glasses, brings over our garlic knots, which we get out first.  Then she also delivers our pizza to us.  By contrast she is very friendly and polite.  \n\nWith all that said...my wife and I decided to hit up I-tap and Epic this past Sunday evening.  There was a younger, short haired blonde girl working at the time we walked in.  We thought we were in for a refresher from the usual grumpy service we'd received of late from Epic.  We received almost exactly the opposite.  We explained at first that we would be eating it at I-Tap and asked to get our garlic knots out first.  She stated to us \"that they go in at the same time so I'm not sure they will make it out beforehand.\"  This has never been a problem in the past and we've always gotten them out at least 5-10 minutes before our pizza.  We went along with it though, thinking things may not be different than in the past.\n\nWell things were very different.  She brought over our large pepperoni pizza and the garlic knots, and smugly stated \"that the pizza wound up coming out first anyways.\"  Which I find impossible that a pizza can cook faster than it takes to throw the garlic bites into a fryer.  The garlic knots have absolutely zero garlic butter on them at all.  We are talking bone dry.  So my wife had to get up to go over there and ask for a side of the garlic butter.  \n\nI could maybe understand any of this if Epic was busy.  However there was one other family in the restaurant that already had their food, so it's not like they were getting bogged down with orders.  \n\nLet me state that I get that it must be frustrating to have a place like I-tap next door so nobody purchases their beer.  Let's look at the facts though..they aren't even offering any good beer!  They offer up the crappy Inbev special of Bud selections!  Why should I even entertain the idea of drinking that beer?  \n\nSecondly...my wife and I tip at least a full 20% share every time.  Not that this means you have to give me great service, but at least be courteous as I'm giving this to you before you even have provided any service to me as the customer.  If they really wanted to they honestly could ask us to come pick up the pizza in x-amount of minutes and we would be glad to do so.  I don't think they should expect the same tip for this service, but if they are truly annoyed to be doing business as they currently do...they could switch to this model. \n\nI honestly do love Epic's pizza, but this sort of service may have done it in for me.",

  "text": "This place was goood. I was in Nashville for a friend's bachelorette. Since planning meals for six girls and a gay guy in a new city across the country is a hit or miss situation, I took to Yelp and open table, chose places, and crossed my fingers and toes. I did good and got bridesmaid points by choosing The Old School. We talked about the damn meal for the rest of the trip. Some of us probably dreamed about it. I know I did.\n\nWe went for brunch and everyone was very impressed. That says a lot since we have a variety of nice brunch options at home. We ordered so much we could barely move. Everything was amazing. The best way to put it is this: you've never had eggs and bacon in your life until you've had freshly harvested and slaughtered eggs and bacon. The food is just different. The ingredients are all fresh from their farm and the texture is amazing. The donuts are fluffy pieces of heaven to die for. It's ok to have beer with breakfast because they make beermosas. Vacation carbs don't count. Order the pastry board.\n\nIt randomly snowed that morning so we couldn't see the animals that are fated to go into the menu. The outside atmosphere is so cute. The building is so rustic, the grounds are very pretty and quaint, with old schoolhouse picnic benches surrounded by gardens from which the vegetables and herbs are harvested from. Just with that experience alone, you immediately forget that you ate Wilbur's delicious cousin. Probably won't be back soon, but I definitely recommend this place to anyone in Nashville.",

  "text": "Their clothes, colors and styles are wonderful. My daughter and I were thrilled to find such a store. The prices are very fair, in our opinions. The low star-rating is due to the rudeness of the people who work in the store. Being aware of the time and the desire to make several purchases my daughter asked upon entering what time the store closed and was told 5:00. We had arrived before 4 so expected no problem. At approximately 4:20 they began turning off lights. At 4:40, one woman working there announced loudly that \"she (referring to my daughter) has been in there (the dressing room)for an hour and keeps coming out for other clothes\". I don't believe that she realized that I was with her. My daughter bought about $400 worth of clothes, which we did think that that's what the store wanted people to do! We left at 4:50. \n\nBut unbeknownst to them, they lost big on this sale!  My daughter is very well known in her field and could have been a wonderful asset to them. You see she has 1.3 Million followers online on one account and 316,000 on another. This young woman grosses over $20,000 a month and has done so for several years. She WILL be asked by her followers where she got these clothes. Sadly, after this treatment, she won't mention the name of the store. \n\nAll of this to say, to this store and others, don't under-estimate these young people and their abilities to influence thousands. And don't be so quick to dismiss them. You may not be aware but these young people online are changing the world. They deserve the same respect that you offer to older shoppers.",

As soon as we sat down we were greeted by the bartender, Cerbi. As a bartender and server she was perfect. Attentive but not overbearing. She would chat with us when we wanted and leave us alone when we didn't. Professionally one of the best fine dining bartenders I've encountered. We started with some delicious pints of local ale, Barrio Blonde. Then we asked our bartender for some app suggestions. Within 15 maybe 20 minutes we had our appetizers. THE BEST PORK BELLY EVER! You must order this dish! When our apps arrived we order our entrees and got those about 20 minutes after finishing app completion.  We tried the house special pork saltimbocca and the alaskan halibut. Both were very nice! I was craving scallops all night but my friend wasn't into scallops so I'll have to come back by myself for those as they looked amazing! Finally we finished with the cannoli dessert! This was incredible! I don't even like desserts but this was devine! I dunked them all up in my Irish coffee! So good! Can't wait to come back! You need to \"treat yo self\" and have dinner here. I love eating at the bar but the dining room looked lovely as well. Great date spot I assume especially with it being in the resort with a great view.",

I'm pretty judgmental when it comes to cheese burgers, and the Institute was impressive.  It was perfectly cooked to order, the meat was juicy and flavorful, and the toppings and bun are good quality.  All of these are essential for a great burger.\n\nI'll continue to hit up this joint and look forward to seeing how they improve.  Maybe Quizzo?",

The service is slightly slow, but perfect if you're just wanting to sit back, drink wine, and eat food. \n\nWe ordered the goat cheese and caramelized onion pizza with the baked brie as an appetizer. The appetizer came out fairly quickly, but our pizza order apparently got lost. The server informed us and gave us a free appetizer while we waited, which was awesome. The brie was amazing, but I love brie so I might be biased. It came with a blackberry jam, which complimented the cheese nicely. The pizza was just okay. I wouldn't order it again, but I'm curious to try other things from the menu. Overall, good first impression of this place. I'd love to come back to drink more wine and try some other foods.",

I asked for hot sauce for my soup. I'm addicted to spice. Kalamata make their own. It was so very good. If ever in green Hills area give this restaurant a try. You will savior the taste all day.",

  "text": "This food is amazing, and the service is outstanding too! We had the pulled chicken platter which is a heaping portion of savory bbq chicken and two sides that are even bigger! The brisket is truly awesome - nicely blackened on the sides, juicy and tender and even pink, no knife needed! They will gladly give you extra sauce, we have enough for our own barbeque! The sides are huge, definitely for sharing. Green beans that were crisp and wonderfully seasoned, baked beans that will spoil you for any others, crisp, fresh slaw, crispy (yes, even in takeout) tater tots, creamy, luscious mac & cheese. We started with caesar salad, definitely enough for two, with nice crisp romaine and a great dressing and cheese and croutons. Oh, and the cornbread is moist, what a nice surprise! And just to show how much they care, good quality silverware, thick napkins, and reusable containers. They package everything separately so the tastes and quality stay apart and you can combine your own way. And they threw in some of those large peppermint candies! We will definitely be picking up again, probably with many friends! What a neighborhood gem!",

Obviously a 5 star restaurant normally is a dress up nice diner, but seems how this is right off broadway st, I think it's perfect. Especially for the area. Their mac n cheese with chicken is absolutely killer. Their pizza is plenty big, and the BBQ pizza is great. Definitely try this place.",

  "text": "I've been to Bridgestone arena before and knew it would be a special experience for my daughter! So I sent my 8 year old on a fun trip to watch a Preds game with her cousins. She was so excited to go to her first hockey game!! I packed her bag (small backpack because a little girl can't remember to keep a purse on her shoulder... and frankly purses are uncomfortable) with her wallet, extra sweaters, chapstick and a pair of p.j.s just in case the game ended late. When she finally got there her aunt sent me a very happy picture of her before entering. Now once she got in was an entirely different story. At the entrance she was asked to empty her bag and throw it away. They did tell my 8 year old who was now sobbing that she could walk it all the way back to the car and come back... how nice. However, that's unrealistic for a child who has hip problems to make the treck once. It was either she throw the bag away or go home (there were 4 other kids with her so home wasn't an option). So, a very sad little girl threw her bag away and sat at a Preds game with her belongings spilling over in her lap. \n\nLastly, If she brought a purse she could have walked it in. I think it's a little unfair to boys/men who wouldn't carry a purse. I think your policy is very one sided and could use relooking at. Either you make it an all around fair policy of no bags or you check bags better. There is no reason for anyone to throw their belonging away especially if it's not on your policy online! Very disappointed in how you handled things.",

My High Value, 6 X9 area rug, which is valued at $3,500  was completely destroyed in that 8 day period.  They are now telling me, after sending an inspector to see the rug at my home, that the amount for my claim is $0.00.  Due to what the inspector said.  Very strange, that the inspectors(2 of them) said they had never seen any thing like that in their life. Mind you, they are cabinet and furniture repair people, and are not rug experts, so why were they sent?  I have proof that the rug had no damage prior to moving and I am taking this to arbitration.  I also find it weird that when I  called the inspector today, I get a voice recording saying they are closed for vacation for 3 weeks!! What store closes for 3 weeks? \n\nI have photos and documentation to support my claim. I will never use Mayflower, United or their agents, Golden Eagle.  I am beyond upset.

Perhaps naively, we showed up at 5pm ready for an hour of range time.\n\nWe were turned away because my shooting partner's attire was not within their policy. 'No tank tops, no short shorts\". Ok. So we told them we'll go get a change of clothes and come back. It's now a few minutes after 5pm.\n\nWe return with the proper attire at approximately 5:30pm and the store is locked. I look inside and 2 employees are cleaning and ignoring me. Eventually a third employee appears, unlocks the door and tells me that they are closed. \n\n\"I thought you close at 6pm?\" I asked.\n\"Well, we stop taking our last shooter at 5pm. If you shot now, you'd only have like 20 minutes anyway.\"\n\n\"So why,\" I asked, \"Didn't you tell us that when you turned us away, and we told you we'd be back with a change of clothes?\"\n\nHe looked dumbfounded and said, \"That wasn't brought up at the counter, sir.\"\n\nNo apology or anything. Just completely did not want our business.\n\nThese people are clueless. \n\nOn a prior occasion, a shooting partner I brought was turned away because her shorts were too short.

Mind you, we still ordered and devoured the tiramisu and cheesecake.\n\nYou can tell that a lot of thoughtfulness went into the planning of this tapas style menu and kudos to the chef who created these recipes! As an added bonus, Johnny Weir was in town and enjoying himself and seeing his beautiful coifed hairdo while hearing laughter and convo bouncing off the ceilings, made for a delightful and entertaining evening. \n\nMake sure to make reservations!

The sign said \"cheesesteak\" among other offerings so I stepped into line. I'm glad I did. \n\nThe line moves a little slow but you get to watch the cooks chop up and grill others' hoagies inside their kitchen/booth. Definitely a good bit as it increases your appetite during the 10 minute or so wait to the register. Everyone was super friendly too. This can increase the wait time as they're willing to explain and offer suggestions for anyone unsure, so a good payoff. \n\nI got the classic with half sweet half hot peppers.

  "text": "For restaurant week, I decided to come back to the restaurant that was so good, it inspired me to start yelping. Unfortunately, I came away more disappointed than the first time. But...I feel like I can't complain too much. I mean, it was restaurant week, so they were packed. And I got SO much food for $30.12. Let me summarize the pros and cons of this visit:\n\nPROS: Exceptional service. They were busy, so I almost expected slow service. But not at all- we were seated right away and had two people waiting on us. Love it when the waitstaff take initiative rather than wait for someone else to take care of the table. The appetizers were delicious- chicken cheese pot pie had an amazingly flaky crust and love the cherries inside. Ox tail was also great. Desserts were semi-sweet, as advertised. Love the apple, pumpkin beignets were okay- probably wouldn't order it again. Generally, though, flavors were spot on.\n\nCONS: The main taysts were disappointing. The lamb came out and half of my cut had the texture of meatloaf. The other half was fine, which made me think it was not on purpose. So I looked over at a neighbor's lamb, and it was also the consistency of ground meat. Is that right? My neighbor was also not pleased and complained about his lamb. The meatballs were dry. The textures of the meats were just not good.\n\nIt was a great deal. But I feel like Tayst can do better.",

  "text": "I had heard great things about Good Dog, and after seeing the triple D episode, I was really excited about trying it out. A group of friends and I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, when the place was pretty empty (one or two other tables aside from ours). I loved the dog pictures on the wall!\n\nWe were seated directly under the air conditioner and were freezing, so we very politely asked the waitress if it was possible to turn it down. She glared at us and said, \"That's the bartender's job, not mine.\" My friend then asked, \"Oh, would you mind asking him to turn it down then?\" She got really sassy and said, \"Well, first of all, the bartender is a SHE. And fine\" before she stomped off. I am all about gender equality and not making assumptions, but there is no reason to be so nasty about an innocent (and frankly, grammatically correct) error. I work in a hospital and am mistakenly called a nurse all the time, but I don't go around berating everyone for it. Maybe this waitress was having a bad day? But seriously, if you're at work, then act like it. \n\nOur food also took almost 45 minutes to come out (we were still shivering this whole time, by the way, because whatever the bartender did to turn down the AC did not work), and when it did, it wasn't mind-blowing. Maybe I had expectations that were too high, but our burgers and po boys were good but not amazing. The aioli for the fries was also pretty bland, though the fries themselves were pretty decent. \n\nThen I had to use the restroom at one point, and I got up to ask the waitress if it was in the back. She just stared at me like I was dumb and said, \"Mhm.\" \n\nHonestly, I'm really disappointed. I was hoping to find a place I could keep coming back to for a good burger and a fun atmosphere. Even though Good Dog does have character, my experience there was pretty awful. I don't think anyone should have to put up with a hostile waitress for decent food - there are plenty of amazing restaurants in Philly that have a nice staff and delicious food for a reasonable price.",

Also, installing the door guards was a MUST before I signed the paperwork he agreed to that too. At the time the vendor wasn't there to install it.  But the salesperson was going to get me an appointment.  After two weeks of waiting I decided to call the salesperson to see the status.  He quickly said he come over to my residence to install personally.  (never happen)  I called the salesperson again he claimed that the service department was suppose to contact me and he would give me a call on the status(never happen).  I decided to call the service manager which was no help.... he directed me back to the salesperson.  I texted the salesperson on the status he took my information and I'm still waiting.  I'm not happy with the service or vehicle that was leased. And still waiting for a call back. I would not recommend this dealership. I should have leased an Audi the deals was much better.",

Nearly every single seat at the bar was taken by a man with a logo on his shirt and a wedding ring on his finger..  \ni'm guessing these were truck drivers away from home, eating at the bar, alone...\n\nWe were in the mood for steak and were trying to decide where to go.  Son was feeling thrifty and went through the different restaurants locally, for steak..  He settled on this restaurant because i told him i had eaten here before and the meat was good.\n\nGot to the bar at 7:15. Didn't get dinner until about 7:40-7:45..\nGot out at 9pm.\nThe wait time for food was long. \nWedge salad came out and the lettuce was dead.. it had been dead for a couple of days, I'm guessing.\nI ordered my steak MR. It came out seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  The grilled asparagus were cooked perfectly.  I wasn't charged for the extra bleu cheese dressing I requested for the dead lettuce.\nFriend ordered rib eye with mac & cheese and a side of grilled shrimp and rice.  He didn't say anything bad about his dinner except that his mac & cheese was off.\nWhen I tasted it, I gathered that they cooked up the pasta and threw some canned cheese sauce on it and called it a day...... terrible.\nI got the little tiny bucket of dessert.. Brownie with a tablespoon of vanilla ice cream on top.\nIt was delicious...  so the asparagus and the brownie was delicious.  \nThe steak?  I brought it home. I'm going to cook it up with eggs, in the morning.\nThey offered to recook it for me, but it took so long to get dinner and dessert, I couldn't bare to think I would have to sit there another 20 minutes for my steak to cook more..\nSo with that.. I have tried this restaurant two times.\nThat's good enough for me.\nI don't recommend it.",

  "text": "I was looking so forward to the Wine Fest!  I have gone the past two years and this year we were bringing others so they could have as much fun as we did.   I can't say we are going to go back next year.  \n\nI understand the price of the ticket, $20.  I enjoy the little glass I get.  What I don't enjoy is standing in line an hour to get in only to be told \"You should have bought a VIP ticket and gotten in earlier if didn't want to wait in line.\"  Wait, what?  \n\nThe Wine Fest has gone from people actually wanting to learn a little to those who just wanted to get drunk. I have several pictures from the event of people passed out on the lawn.  \n\nIt was a warm day so we needed to buy water.  Guess what, not all vendors can sell water, only a select number of vendors could - and they had run out.  Why would water be an item that every vendor can't sell?  I understand not wanting to have 50 pizza joints - but come on - we all need water.  \n\nThe tasting lines were terribly long with some people camping out at certain locations. \n\nMost vendors took both credit and cash.\n\nThe vendors who were selling products were pretty nice.  I enjoyed the variety of items that were available.  \n\nThe food trucks are always fun to sample and offer a unique variety of food to sample.\n\nSave the frustration - take a drive to your favorite winery.  Mallow Run is only 30 minutes away.  Oliver is 45 minutes away.  Each offer a more relaxed environment.",

  "text": "We came here on a Sunday with three of our friends. When we went inside to check the wait time, the hostess took my name and asked for my phone number, I was expecting a phone call when our table was ready, but they actually sent text messages with a link to an app that allows you to see where your place in line is which we thought was pretty cool.\nThe inside is really nice and clean. We were seated at a round table next to a fireplace with a huge skylight right over our table.\nWe decided to share an order of the OMG french toast as an appetizer. It came with three pieces of dipped whole wheat french toast topped with dollops of pumpkin cinnamon mascarpone, toasted pecans, caramel drizzle, and bacon. To be completely honest, I did not think that this french toast sounded appetizing at all - but I could not have been more wrong about it! The mascarpone was such a great flavor on the french toast, and the bacon added an unexpected smokiness to it.\nI ordered the bandito burrito (tortilla with three scrambled eggs, onions, peppers, chorizo - it comes covered in cheese with a small cup with sour cream, and I opted for no salsa. It comes with a side of home fries and fruit). I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito, it was HUGE - I didn't think there was anything \"special\" about it per se, but it was done really well and I would be happy to order it again.\nMy husband ordered the big easy benedict (corn bread topped with avocado, creole seasoned onions, peppers, and chorizo, with poached eggs, and a cajun hollandaise. Maybe the reason I feel the way I do about the burrito I ordered is because I tried the big easy benedict - truly the best eggs benedict I have ever had. It is packed with flavor, and the corn bread pairs so perfectly with the flavor profile.\nOur friends ordered the wilbur skillet (bacon, potatoes, avocado, diced tomatoes, cheese, and eggs your way), grande huevos rancheros (diced potatoes, chipotle peppers, chorizo, onions, black beans, cilantro, avocado, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and eggs your way), and the tuscany omelette (roasted red peppers, spinach, sausage, and mozzarella).\nI didn't try their orders, but they all seemed to enjoy everything.\nThe reason I didn't give The Turning Point five stars was for a few reasons - we were told our wait would be around 45 minutes and it was over an hour and 3 of the five egg orders were incorrect. They had switched the egg orders on the huevos rancheros and the wilbur skillet (which we didn't realize until later that day), and my husband's poached eggs were very overcooked - they were basically hard boiled without the shell. \nThose things aside we will definitely be returning and I can't wait to try the corn bread french toast and their specialty hot chocolates!",

Any time there was an issue--green pool, low pressure, etc and I called I was greeted by an employee who not once said \"I'm sorry, let me see what I can do about this\". It was always my fault according to them. \nI have been watching the pressure on the pool for the last 3 1/2 weeks. It was way too high. The pressure in the pump was lousy. Even though the tag on the door said they cleaned the filter, it was apparent they did not. I took the top off the filter to verify. When I called today, an employee answered and said \"how did I know the filter was not cleaned\" . I explained that they had just been there today, in the past few hours, and the pressure was lousy, and I checked the filter and it was dirty. The guy said \"well you should only clean them every 4 weeks\". I asked if the filter is dirty shouldn't they clean them? He said yes. Not once did he say, let me send someone out there to take care of it. He continued to argue with me. I asked for a manager. The manager got on the phone. I told him the same story. He asked me how long the filter had been in there. I told him not very long. He continued to argue. I asked him,, why is it that everytime there is a problem, it is my fault, not Pinch A Pennys. He continued to argue with me. Then he said \"if the service is so bad, why did we continue to have it for 2 years?\". I said, maybe I am not real bright, but I am terminating my service, and do NOT charge me for the month. He said \"are you threatening me\" ? I said no, I said \"Do not charge me for the month when you did not do what you were supposed to do\". Liars, idiots, yes they are. I wouldn't have a bird bath cleaned by these people.

  "text": "Arrived a few minutes before 2:00. Hostess/waitress didn't seem happy to see us. After she sat us with menus, she came back about 5 minutes later (2:04). I asked if they had any lunch specials because we got the dinner menu, she said (In a nasty tone) that lunch stops at 2:00, I said it is now 5 after and we got here before 2:00, she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I noticed that the clock over the register is set about 15 minutes fast. If you go through that much trouble to stop serving lunch... Why serve it at all?\n\nTo be fair I started writing this review while waiting for my food and had given them 1 star. The food is a solid 4 plus.. But points deducted for bad customer service.",

  "text": "What a great place to have brunch!\n\nWe hit this place up with friends on the Saturday before Easter. Even though it was busy, there was ample space to sit and dine in peace. I didn't feel like I was rubbing elbows with strangers, like I often do at restaurants. \n\nOn top of that, I was so pleased with the inventive and delicious mimosas! Strawberry and pepper! Grapefruit and winter spices! Flavorful balanced twists on a classic drink. We sampled them all, and you should too.\n\nFor food, we mostly stuck to the taco menu, though my husband departed and got the johnny cakes and fried chicken (which he enjoyed). Here's where the restaurant fell down a little bit. The tacos were composed almost exclusively of meat. Each taco had a generous serving of delicious meat, but only a sparse serving of other toppings, be it a single wedge of avocado, or a lone thin slice of jalapeno. I get it - it's BUTCHERtown Hall. It's about the meat. But even the bell of the ball needs a date to the dance. Of course the meat was delicious, but all of the tacos could have been enhanced by more toppings.\n\nThere were also problems with plating practices. If three people at the table order lamb tacos, a single plate of three lamb tacos comes to the table. Since everyone had ordered a smorgasbord of different tacos, keeping tabs on who got what taco was difficult, both for us and for our waitress. Three of our tacos didn't come out and we had to inquire about them. \n\nStill an overall enjoyable experience. Go to Butchertown Hall for an easy quiet brunch and order some incredible mimosas and meat centric dishes. Write down who had what.",

  "text": "One word HORRIBLE!!!\nAs locals we are always looking for a new place to eat. Found this place and seeing it was pretty affordable, decided to give it a try.\n\nThe waitress was very sweet and attentive, but the food was horrible. \nWe ordered the falafel appetizer and 2 sandwiches. Falafel tasted a little burnt, but ok. The sandwiches were pathetic. there were maybe 3 pieces of meat in them and barely any vegs. The flavor was mediocre and not much flavor. We ended up having to order another appetizer to fill us up.\n\nThe kicker.... while we were eating my husband saw a rat run up a pipe in the kitchen. We told the waitress and got a half assed sorry and she walked away.  No manager came to the table to apologize or order any type of discount. In fact they kept looking at us, but never approached the table.\n\nI will never go back and will be sure to advise anyone thinking of going to stay away.",

The set up is Quiznos style where you order the style wich and they get the meat and cheese then put it thru the toaster on a conveyor belt and another staff member does the veggies and dressings . I got an Italian and they were nice enough to add balsamic dressing on it for me even though it is for salads primarily . The hot peppers are a must ! They are fresh fresh fresh and not too spicy just delicious . Everything tastes high quality and for the regular sandwich with chips it was only 6$ and change . A great spot for a killer simple sub .",

Mostly, the food consists of standard bar food, mostly deep fried goodness resembling nothing even a little healthy.  The drinks are well made, and the beer is cheap.  I can never argue with cheap booze...it always makes the bar experience that much better.  Also, I am a huge fan of the atmosphere.  The place is incredibly laid back, from the patrons to the workers, and they always make an effort to keep your drinks filled up.  \n\nThis is just like a neighborhood bar, and everyone who hangs out here generally seems like they have been hanging out here for years.  It's a nice place and a bar I really enjoy frequenting....",

Sail Pavilion can be a great stop for anyone biking, running, or walking the Tampa Bay Riverwalk.  This place is dog friendly with plenty of dog water bowls available so bring your furry friends! However, the service is terribly slow. Drink prices are a bit pricey at $5-7 per beer and $8-12 per mixed drink. They have a wide variety of tropical drinks including: the blue crush, pina colada, strawberry daquiri, rum runner, coco loco, mud slide, margarita, sex on the beach, mai tai, and mojito. I had the burger and shrimp wontons and they were both awful. They only have 1 waiter and 2 bartenders for the whole place.  I got tired of waiting and went up to the bar and that took over 10 minutes in a 4 deep line just to get a drink.  They need a better menu and more staff on the weekends. Especially if there is an event at the Convention Center. Sail Pavilion has food trucks almost every Friday and is a local crowd favorite gathering spot for residents of Downtown and Habour Island. Boaters can dock their boat at the marina in front of the restaurant, take a boat tour from the marina, rent water bikes, rent boats, and soak in pretty views of the boats in the marina, Jackson's Waterfront Bistro, Harbour Island, Davis Island, the Hillsborough River, and even Bayshore!",

  "text": "It was a cryptic and memorable Friday night (in early April).\n\nWalking down (dark and shady) Gaskill Street on my way to Marrakesh, I already felt as if I had been transported to sequestered residential alleyway in a Moroccan town. I kept looking back after we turned the corner because I literally thought that someone was following my friend and I. At last, we spotted the green Marrakesh awning and spotted some men chatting while grilling meats under the bright outdoor light. They instructed us to use the side entrance on Leithgow.\n\nWe knocked on the door twice. A few seconds later, somebody opened the door asking if we had a reservation. \"No,\" I said. He let us in anyway.\n\nWe were seated immediately (because this place is TINY). Then, we realized two things: 1) that this place was cash only (which is always a huge turn-off), 2) that the only dinner option was a 7-course menu. We deliberated for a few seconds, and decided that we would stay for the adventure. I'm glad we did. \n\nMy friend ran to the nearest ATM to get some cash. Meanwhile, I had already started digging into the first course before he returned. We still joke that we think we were already 50% full after just the first course. There's unlimited pita bread (throughout your meal, not just the first course; they actually encourage you to take a handful each time) and massive servings of very filling eggplant, mint/carrot and cucumber side dishes. I think the second dish was the olive chicken dish, which was so amazingly tender and well-flavored. If I recall correctly, that's the only course where you had the option to choose between two dishes.\n\nA few minutes pass. Everything is kind of hazy in my mind after the second dish because we both gradually slipped into a massive and serious food coma. We literally just slouched there and thought \"OMG... how much more do we have to eat. My stomach is literally about to explode.\" It's not like we could take it to-go. There was even a belly dancing performance somewhere in between. Desserts came and we breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nEverything tasted really good. I've never had Moroccan food before this, but I get a feeling that everything tasted relatively authentic. Some of the textures and tastes are a little bizarre for the American palate (like the scrambled-egg like dessert). Nonetheless, it tasted good and that's all that really matters.\n\nHere's some things to know before you come:\n- It's cash-only. There's an ATM at the restaurant, but, of course, you never want to fall for that trap.\n- Come with more than one other person! I saw two other groups that were just two people, but trust me, you will start to feel uncomfortable by the third or fourth course and it's not a pleasant feeling. And definitely don't come here alone. I would say 3-5 people is a good party size.\n- Be prepared to eat with your hands. Utensils are not the norm here.\n- The ambiance is wonderful. It's like a little piece of Morocco that made its way to Philadelphia. With that said, it can get kind of boisterous. \n- Service is great.\n- Generally quite affordable. My friend and I ate like pigs and we still paid like $30 each. They also pre-calculate the gratuity for you, I think, so you just pay the amount that's on the check.",

I had the buffalo chicken wrap with fries and a mango margarita.\n\nThe Buffalo Chicken Wrap had Crispy Chicken, Buffalo Sauce, Celery, and ranch dressing (I swapped that for the Bleu Cheese Dressing that it typically comes with) Tomatoes, and Lettuce.  The buffalo sauce was a bit overpowering for my taste. The next time I'll probably just ask for that on the side. I also got the natural cut fries with it and they were bland. They were hot and crisp, but didn't really have a flavor profile. \n\nThe margarita was good. I would get that again. It was a nice balance of alcohol and sweetness.\n\nThings to know:\n1. This location is in the mall so you will most likely park underground and have to pay a small fee for parking (unless you happen to snag one of the few street level parking spots).\n2. Remember your elevator or escalator so you don't lose your car.",

I lovethis stuff!\n2) Not only do they sell jewelry but a lot of accessories too! I've been able to score some really cute items such like my pink leopard print iPad holder.\n3) Selection: Charming Charlies has a great selection of items that will dress up your everyday outfits. But they also have huge section for prom or a big night out. They now have a section just dedicated in this location for little girls.\n4) Sale: There's always a very big clearance area. This the clearance section was buy one get one free so I scored three pairs of earrings and two big necklaces for only just $12!\n\nSo as you see I probably can tell if my review that I get overly excited just walking into the place. Of course I love the store is always color code in a coordinated but I love that I can always find something that I can quickly add to my wardrobe at a decent price. I LOVE Charming Charlie's! I'll be back!!!!",

After 2 weeks of checking for the refund it never came I disputed the charge with my credit card and he still contested and did not give my money back ....I learned after losing 64 dollars that this shop is unethical and is not to be trusted .................BEWARE this is not a shop that you can trust",

I had to add a ton of salsa, which also wasn't spicy - just something to dump on top.\n\nThey do have pretty good carrots, which are a staple in Taco shops throughout the West. And the decor is nice. The staff is friendly, and this is one of the better Betos locations.\n\nTwo stars for the food and four for the ambiance. Average = three stars...",

The sides I selected were ok, I enjoyed the potato salad but it needed a bit more salt (was a little bland), I didn't love the black eye peas side...however if you are a fan of red bell peppers, green bell peppers, black eyed peas and vinegar you may enjoy it.

I was there with a couple of buddies and we ordered the 50 wing plate with the standard Sybergs sauce.  We ordered the wings extra crispy since the crew I was with were wing experts  and our experience has taught us to be careful with undercooked wings.  Of course we've never had that problem here and the cook made them to perfection.  Between the three of us we devoured the entire plate.  I ordered a dinner salad which was much larger than I thought, so I wound up wasting it.  Overall it was a very good experience in the food was good as expected.  I would greatly recommend that you",

This could easily be a 10 stars place.\n\nTried it today for the first time, we got the Gamberi di Buffalo (shrimp in hot sauce with blue cheese and celery) as an appetizer. The shrimps were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of breading, nice and spicy but without disabling your taste buds for hours. A wonderful appetizer.\n\nAs the main entree we opted for the 3 Cheese Pizza (they use REAL gorgonzola cheese and not some crumbled concoction of blue cheese and God knows what else like most other places do, if they even offer something in the likes). The pizza was excellent, ultra thin like a real pizza is supposed to be (very italian style), nicely cooked with a nice crisp crust and a blackened out bottom (it's not burned, just the way a pizza is meant to be if cooked at the right temperature). No overpowering flavors, the cheeses perfectly blend in with each other making it one of the most mouth watering pie in the area.\n\nNeedless to say the whole pie (large) was consumed at the table, no leftovers for my dinner with this one, and trust me....it is difficult not to finish their Pizza. \n\nDelicate yet bold in flavor, and does not leave you with that bloated feeling after consuming it.\n\nOveral was a wonderful experience, my taste buds are still dancing with joy. \n\nDefinitely a keeper and won't be long before we go back for another pizza and to try some of the other entree they provide on their well assorted menu.\n\nStaff was friendly, service was fast and spot on.\n\nOh did I mention their bread? A new take on the usually boring garlic knots offered by pizza parlors. And a successful take shall I say, nicely flavored, soft and moist to the point I could just go there and eat that for lunch and be satisfied.\n\nGreat little gem of a place.",
