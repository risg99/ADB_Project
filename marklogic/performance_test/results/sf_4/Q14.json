It was a great smoothie, however the prices are really high at $7.50. I've lived in many juice friendly cities that have organic fresh juices and smoothies and this is by far the most expensive place I've tried. I'm not sure my wallet can handle frequent visits but for a splurge once in awhile, I'll  definitely come back.",

She, Kevin, & ALL the servers were FANTABULOUS!! We had SOO much fun pickin appetizers & drinks & the place was just buzzin with HAPPY! The food was AWESOME, even tho we'd never had many things on the menu, like Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Yellow Beet salad, & Pate'! The stuff we were used to like raw/fried/baked oysters, & crisped french baguette sliced was PERFECT! Oyster ACTUALLY tasted like OYSTERS...even the FRIED ones (they & the raw ones are part of Happy Hour fare, along with half priced cocktails & wine)! I kno this is LONG but it's worth EVERY WORD! I'd recommend this place to EVERYONE, from locals to tourists! THANK U guys for makin us feel SOO at home!",

  "text": "No, no, no, no.....just no. My friend and I ordered the fried oysters, seafood gumbo, crawfish pasta and the soft-shelled crab to share. We ate as much as we could, left the restaurant full and satisfied, but then spent the rest of the night sick. Very sick. Like stay-in-the-bathroom-for-hours sick. I am afraid that every time I think about fried seafood, I'll remember this experience and then promptly throw up. \n\nOther than the raging sickness that descended on our trip, the restaurant was just OK. Service was friendly but awkward (why did we have three servers?) and the food was good but nothing special. We certainly had better gumbo and seafood at other points in our trip (this was a pre-food poisoning opinion).",

  "text": "I'm originally from Atlanta, GA and have eaten at Longhorn Steakhouses for years.  I was very excited when I found out that one was opening in Tucson even though it is 45 minutes from where I live.\n\nSo today I decided to try it out.  I went by myself for a late lunch (around 1:30).  Walked in a was immediately greeted but had to wait a few minutes because I didn't want to sit at the bar.  My server, Amanda, came over and asked for my drink order and I ordered water with extra lemon.  She brought it back shortly but with only one lemon slice and quickly disappeared before I could say anything.  A little later she came back for my food order and when I gave that to her I again asked for extra lemons. \n\nThen I went to the restroom and when I came back by table had been cleared - no water or silverware and wiped down.  Someone who worked there was near by and I told her that my table had been cleared.  She apologized and told me that my water was \"right here\".  Right here was a large, round table full of dirty glasses and silverware.  I just looked at her and she said \"I'll go get you a new water\".  While she was gone to get the water a hostess came up and asked me \"did someone seat you here?\".  I explained what happened and she said she just wanted to be sure since I didn't have a menu. \n\nWhen Amanda brought my salad to me I had to remind her (3rd time) that I was still waiting for my extra lemons.  Finally got them. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food 3 people were seated in the booth next to me.  They had to wait for a server and when one finally came over to them they had questions.  The customers wanted to know about a sauce (not sure which one), the waiter starts to tell them what was in a sandwich.  When the customer said he wanted to know what was in the sauce and not the sandwich the waiter gave him a look of disgust and said \"I'm telling you all I know\",  looked at them again and then said \"I'll be back to take your order\" and walked off.  Amanda went to them sometime later and said that she would be their server because he became busy.  One of the other diners stated that she thought they might have scared him off and that he was snarly with them.  Amanda looked at them and said \"you're not going to run me off, are you?\"  I didn't think the either server was very nice to those diners.\n\nBack to me, once my food arrived the fries were limp, very brown and lukewarm.  Flo's filet came out fine.  I ate my food and I think Amanda only checked back with me once.  Someone else (manager maybe, she didn't identify herself) came to clear the table and asked if I wanted a box for the fires that weren't good.  I told her no and that they weren't very good.  She apologized and asked if I'd like another side.  Hello - I'm through with my meal, offer me a desert or something but not another side.  Received the check shortly afterwards, paid and left.  BTW, the table with the dirty glasses and silverware that was next to me was dirty the whole time I was there.  There were two couples waiting to be seated even though there were empty tables.  I may give this Longhorn another try but more likely than not I'll go to Lil' Abners.",

Kebabs. Mmmmm. And the pitas? Wow. Puffy and thin as a wafer; so tasty we ate 3 between us. By-the-glass wine a little pricey, but all in all a good value meal.

However, the past few experiences have been somewhat disappointing. The quality has not been consistent, the broth has been a bit oily and the last time I went the chicken was slimy and I got the feeling it was at least a few days old. All in all I would still recommend the restaurant to others but I wouldn't give them high expectations. The spring rolls are always great!!",

  "text": "With an entrance off the street and through the Kimpton's Hotel Monaco lobby, it's easy to find your way in.  A seat on the second floor gives a bit of a view towards Independence Hall.  Dark red weathered bricks and exposed rough looking wood beams lend an \"old Philadelphia\" air to the setting, but the food is purely modern.  \n\nCorn and crab fried fritters get a bite from chipotle dipping sauce, but could use a bit less breaking, as the sweet corn and crab are a bit overpowered.  The BLT features Brie on brioche, with avocado optional for extra creaminess.  House green salad splits well if you're having apps and a lighter lunch.",

The grocery part of the store is much less populated, and very expensive. But quite clean and organized! The one gripe I have about this place is the check out line. The place is always packed with people trying to buy lunch yet they seem to only have two check out lanes open. There's also no conveyor belt on which to set your groceries which congests the store even further. Lines form and people get agitated. This is enough of a reason for me to dread stopping in here when I have to pick something up quick!",

With L/T on a rugged multigrain bread, it's hands down the best egg salad I've ever had. They have a nice style with every food item, nothing is taken for granted, just as they didn't do a routine egg salad. Yes, comes with the horse radishy potato salad, yum. Excellent coffee, semi-friendly baristas - what more could you want? As mentioned, I particularly like their potato salad, check it out, it comes with sandwiches but I believe you can also order it as a separate side order. Outdoor seating is a plus. Wifi and warm, quiet atmosphere (despite the many young kids that are brought in) make it not a bad place to get a little work done as well.",

  "text": "Slightly better now with the new owners.  The lady at the register with the green/blue hair is the only polite one who works there. Everyone else needs to be trained/taught how to deal with the public. The health and beauty department is always about 90 degrees fahrenheit and I doubt that helps keep the products from spoiling/melting.\n\nThe last time I ate there, I was eating, when I suddenly heard the sound of nails being clipped. I looked over, and yep, the lady working at the cafe was standing right by the food trays, clipping her nails. When I told the owner bout it, he shrugged his shoulders and walked away to go back to stocking shelves. \n\nThe cafe serves up flavorless slop and I cannot believe I gave it the benefit of the doubt on three occasions. I could not even eat most of it. (you are better off eating at Soy Cafe) The prepared food in the refrigerated section is okay, a hit or miss. I keep asking them where they moved their 'Awesome foods' brand items and they keep pointing at other foods that are clearly not the same brand. I tried the other brands and they are not as good as the Awesome Foods brand. I guess they no longer carry them. \n\nThe juice bar attendants act as though I am torturing them when I place an order. No worries, there are LOTS of other juice bars in Philly, yes, even in my neighborhood (fish town)\n\nOverall, their prices on most items are too high and I suspect that their employees are paid a low wage. I often see products on the shelves that are about to expire the next day and there is no discount on them. All of this is a recipe for going out of business.\nI still go there to buy certain items, but do most of my shopping elsewhere.\n\nPenn Herb Company is MUCH better, so is Whole Foods and several others.",

The outdoor seating was very beautiful and the overall ambiance of the place was hip and cool but also homey at the same time. The food was really really good. The bacon is more of a short rib and it was a highlight of my meal. Another thing that blew me out of the water was the biscuits. Wowza. Best biscuits ever. Period. \nThe only reason I am not giving it a 5 was because of the unwillingness to take out a nonessential ingredient due to an allergy. The waffle is topped with pistachio butter, which I am allergic to, and when I asked for it on the side or not to be added they said they couldn't do it. I don't get why not. That was about the only disappointment.",

Now onto the rib eyes that had plenty of flavor and nice color.  If dining together, I suggest each person getting a different side as they don't do family style.  I asked for a wine recommendation to pair with the rib eye, expecting it would be the most expensive selection.. haha, the server suggested the zin.  It was fabulous.  We are generally 50/50 on having desert but based on the recommendation of the bread pudding we indulged.  Well worth the extra calories! The service was excellent and friendly.",

My husband and I, taking advantage of their happy hour, ordered their nachos. We've had them before and they are yummy. But tonight, instead of cubed moist chicken they gave us soggy, shredded, crock-pot like chicken. Also, the nachos are supposed to come with beans. I counted the beans.......there were 7 total beans (I sent it back asking for more beans and my plate came back with MAYBE 12 beans). Flavor was lacking. My son ordered the corn dog pops. He loves their cheddar-IPA sauce. Our server did not tell us that the restaurant no longer made this sauce (despite us requesting two sides of it), and instead brought two sides of spicy mustard sauce (he's a little kid! What was the thinking there??). I have one other complaint that I have felt for awhile, that being that the service is T.E.R.R.I.B.L.E. Don't go in there expecting to get your drinks in a timely manner. You are lucky if you get them before your meal. And even more lucky if a server comes up to you to take your order at all.",

My first trip was to get a Po Boy because i heard they had the Previous owner's recipe (Patrick) and were still getting the bread from Leidenheimer's in New Orleans.  It is indeed the same Po Boy(which is by far the best poboy in Nashville), but I have to admit was a little disappointed to get a half for what I'm used to paying for a whole.  At least offer a whole for $20, I'd pay that for it.  My second trip was for a Burger, because when I was there the first time, the burgers did look fantastic.  I ordered a Jumpback Jack and my wife got the Fun Guy.  Both were excellent.  The combination of flavors on the Jumpback are about the best I've had in a long while.  While I've had some burgers at other places that I thought the actual meat was better (dry aged or wagyu).  The actual combination of toppings and meat really made it special.",

The atmosphere was great, quiet enough to have a conversation at your table but still a great hip vibe. We ordered off the DevourIndy menu, getting a full 3 course meal for $20! For our first course we had chicken empanadas with guacamole, mushroom empanadas with jalapeño crema, and ceviche. We were very pleased to find the ceviche had shrimp in it, even though the menu did not state that. For our main course we ordered Paella. Our waitress did a great job of telling us that their Paella was a SPICY dish. And it was true to the warning, but amazing with all the different flavors and the fresh tastes. For dessert we had chocolate flan and churros, both great but it was a unanimous vote at our table for the churros in Carmel sauce. Overall it was an amazing experience with absolutely no complaints to be had!",

I really was full already but the main entrees were just as good. I've had better ribeye but I loved the Branzino with the red pepper paste. The olive oil garlic paste for the steak was amazing. \n\nThe desserts are delicious and I can recall it was a melted cheese with rose water syrup but can't remember the name, it's intended for 2. Do order that. \n\nWe had the top 5 mezzos but you must try the Fatteh, chickpeas in the brown butter with cashews  and almonds was my favorite. I also loved the other mezzas like samke nayyeh with raw yellow tail and fried kibbeh (because my husband wanted some meat)\n\nI almost forgot to mention but I was impressed with the beer on tap called Kronenbourg Blanc (I can't drink wine) really nice fruity blend.",

I cannot believe I have yet to write a review for it.\n\nThey have PLENTY of big tables (and lots of little ones) in the big main room and also some additional seating in a smaller adjoining room. The back patio is a nice place to hang if you don't need an outlet. The staff is super friendly and do a great job with any order!\n\nThe drinks are pretty good - my favorite being a vanilla dirty chai with almond milk. They also have a bottomless cup of coffee deal for $3 - perfect for an all hours study binge! The food is decent - nothing fancy, but it's fresh and they have gluten-free bread that they'll substitute for any bagel. I like the Rox out with your Lox Out (open face) sandwich and the Garden Griller, but I mostly just eat here when I'm pulling a long study session and don't want to go home in the middle. \n\nThe music they play is pretty chill and usually my style, but you can easily put on headphones if you're feeling something else. \n\nIt can get crowded sometimes and harder to find a big table, but something usually frees up eventually!\n\nI would recommend it for studying, grabbing a coffee with a friend, or even a first date (I've eavesdropped on a some hilarious blind dates here).",

I ordered the Toad in the Hole sandwich, which I used to love, and I had to take off the tomatoes and avocado.

I honestly wanted to throw up after eating it. All in all, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. I don't know how it has managed to stay in business this long, and it does not deserve to stay in business. Next time you want to eat out, go somewhere else instead.",

  "text": "Not only delicious steaks, but excellent customer service. My wife had ordered Aussie fries and thought she was getting some doctored up fries with cheese. When regular plain fries were delivered, she mentioned it, but did not demand a replacement. After the more than courteous server Jordan inquired several times, my wife said it was her mistake and no problem. Minutes later, the manager Jessica arrived with an order of cheese fries. How unexpected and customer service oriented. Great gesture Jessica. You just earned a customer that usually goes to the Fishhawk location which is about the same distance. I had the Mouth watering Victoria filet and broiled lobster tail with a side baked potato and Caesar salad. All were cooked to perfection and would highly recommend. Happy hour till 7pm  is nice and the IPA on tap was earthy without a bitter after taste. The strawberry shortcake was scrumptious. Jordan was very upbeat and arrived at the table during the right times.",

If other people love their food just like I do then yes, of course Rich City would get busy and that's a good thing if you ask me.  The food is always great and I love the steamed chicken with mixed vegetable and the sweet and sour chicken is amazing too!  Oh, and the pizza rolls are the best... It's worth the wait!",

We decided to try again the next day for lunch and was able to order a shrimp poboy.\n\nIt took them about 20-30 minutes to make 10 orders of shrimp poboys, but that meant it was a perfect time to grab a frozen irish coffee from the bar. \n\nThe shrimp poboys reminded me of vietnamese sandwiches. Same type of bread with lots of veggies, but the key ingredient is the fresh shrimp. Every time I've had shrimp poboys, the shrimp has always been fried, but this time I was pleasantly surprised to see the shrimp without batter. \n\nThe sandwich was quite delicious although quite expensive at $14.",

  "text": "Hilton advertises trail rides at this resort. The trail rides were run by Pot a Gold adventures. More like Pot o Crap. \nWe were charged $80 per person for a sunset trail ride. When we arrived as instructed at 4pm there  was only one woman there , she had her retainer out on the table, was eating pizza, and had a pack of cigarettes next to her food, and the staff for the ride wasn't even there yet. We waited almost 20 minutes.\nThe smell was overwhelming. The horses were filthy, to be honest. They were caked with dirt and feces and their manes were matted. \nOur ride started at 4:40 and ended at 5:15. The sun was directly overhead and it was no where close to sunset. So, basically were charged for an hour sunset ride that was about 35 minutes and not at sunset.the \"sunset\" ride was $20 more PER PERSON than the one hour trail ride. The manager I emailed said they can't have the horses out at sunset because they get spooked and also because they need to eat. Ummmm, fine, but then don't call it a sunset ride and charge more for it. They refused to refund the extra money they charged for the \"sunset\" ride, and were very rude about it. \nThe horses were not well behaved and my husbands horse just walked off the trail to go back to the stable , the guide said he wanted to eat. The \"trail\", by the way, is a patch of grass and cacti next to the highway. It was awful. Not at all what was advertised. Will be reporting to BBB for false advertising by Hilton and Pot a Gold adventures.",

Similar to many other on here, we sat down to a partially-set table and waited 40+ minutes for mediocre to completely sub-par food.   They do not have chai (my favorite part of any Indian restaurant) and they waited until AFTER two of us had ordered lamb dishes to tell us that they did not have any lamb in the restaurant.  That sucks, but tell us that when we sit down so we don't waste time deciding which lamb dish to order!  My mom hates spicy food and ordered a mild chicken dish.  I love spicy and ordered a medium chicken dish.  We had to switch.  Hers made my eyes water and mine was bland.  The food itself was completely bizarre... none of it had any sauce.  Hers was a really dry biryani.  Mine was some kind of weird chicken sausage, which consisted of about 8 slices on a bed of iceberg lettuce.  Totally blah - I've had better Indian from a MALL.

Once my table was ready, I was told to walk across the room to the stairway and walk up a flight of stairs to be greeted by another hostess that would show me to my table.  The table they offered me was in the corner away from the live entertainment that was playing on the main stage downstairs.  I denied their table and found a spot at the bar on the same level that was not crowded.  I ordered a drink and sat back to relax to the sound of the band playing cover songs.  I thought the red tractor hanging upside down added a neat touch to the atmosphere inside the bar.  The drink I ordered was smooth and easy.

Rippy's is great for after work drinks or a quick dinner, but if your coming in from out of town and want to enjoy a nice meal I would suggest another place. The plastic cups and Paper plates were a huge turnoff epically for the price we paid\n\nThe Food was ok we had the nachos with pulled chicken, I believe they would have been better if they weren't served Luke warm. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs, and usually I am not a fan of dry bbq or bbq where you have to apply your own sauce but these were good. The meat was tender and smokey and fell right off the bone. The sweet tea could have been better.  My overall opinion is that the food was tasty and the atmosphere great but that does not equal a good restaurant.

  "text": "I skipped breakfast in anticipation of eating a decent brunch at Valerio. Bad idea. Ordered the quiche at 12:45 PM and was told that even though they had just run out, they would have another ready to serve in 1 hour tops. I waited until 2:15 PM until I walked up to the counter to politely inquire about the status of my quiche, as I was starving. Got a cold look and a \"Actually, it'll be 45 more minutes because we still have to cool it.\" Fine. Waited until 3. Still nothing. \nThe weirdest part was that they had ALREADY charged my card for the quiche. Before I could ask for a refund so I could purchase something else, she rudely snapped \"you can keep coming up to the counter if it makes you feel better, but I just can't cut the quiche right now.\" I was so shocked that I just said okay, honestly was a little frightened off. When it was finally made (2.5 hours later), it was essentially 4 bites of a veggie omelet with no crust. It would've been nice to hear a \"sorry about the extended wait\" instead of getting attitude. \nIt's totally fine if it takes you 2-3 hours to make that. Just don't lie to your customers in order to get them to buy things. And don't be insanely rude about it?\n\nAlso worth noting - the wifi here doesn't work if there are lots of people",

The mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth, and the pineapple casserole was an unusual hit with me that reminded me of pineapple upside down cake. It served as dessert with its sweet taste.\n\nWhile I had never heard of Barbara's, the atmosphere was interesting and homey. I felt like I was sitting down for a bite to eat at my grandmother's house. Service was friendly although not particularly fast, and photos of famous people who have visited line the wall behind the cash register. Actually, it sort of reminded me of the Loveless Cafe with better rolls.",

It was so salty, neither me or my husband could eat it (and my husband likes salt!).  When I mentioned it to the waitress, she said she had several other customers say the same thing...  She then went back to the kitchen to inquire about it and then informed us that this is how it is supposed to taste, so it must just be our taste buds.  She was nice about it, so we don't blame her.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because their banana pancakes were pretty tasty.  Just wish they would have handled our complaint differently.",

I was blown away by Peter & Co.'s service.\n\nThis was my first sit down, full meal at Saigon. Expectations: High. Reality: Really High. \n\nThis place is exactly why I travel. Nearly every city in America probably has something similar -- a strip mall tucked away in a unsuspecting area -- that is thriving with authenticity. Especially here, the Banh Mi & Pho! \n\nNow... that's not all they have... their menu is, well, how do I say it, um... HUGE!\n\nFrom lemongrass beef wraps to catfish in a clay pot. I went with the finest soup & sandwich of my life: bbq pork banh mi & Pho Special of flank steak, beef brisket, beef meatballs and tripe in classic Pho fashion. \n\nMy first visit I thought I was eating bbq beef banh mi, I was incorrect -- it's some stellar bbq pork that is spot on.\n\nThe bean sprout & fresh basil side plate with the pho was a supreme touch. \n\nThe service was pretty remarkable considering he's serving a party of 26 in a restaurant that seats about 40 at most. Um, the Yelp Supper Club came through -- big time here. At the other end of the table, I salivated, and salivated, for the Vietnamese Coffee that Jessica  & Rodney were having. My lord, I have to return midday before my coffee cut off time of 3pm. \n\nAnd then, something historic happened. There it was, the banh mi bbq pork (re: photo)... it sat there with it's open profile of pork, cilantro, cucumber, carrots & jalapeno on a french roll; she just couldn't resist. She, whom is anti-pork as my Inner Rabbi, my LP, took her first banh mi bite, and I have a Sakijewa golden dollar on it that she'll return for more!\n\nAs will I!\n\nNote: Amazingly classy touch of the sides of beer six packs cut out and taped above each booth in a row to display what beers are offered (which includes 3 Viet beers!)",

  "text": "Walked in for dinner with my girlfriend on a whim. I had read up on Maynard's here on Yelp, so I knew to avoid sitting on the patio. Apparently this wasn't even an issue as all the tables had been booked and the only available space was at the bar. This suited me just fine since a not-so-secret restaurant tip is that sitting at the bar almost always guarantees good service.\n\nTrue to that truism, the bartender treated us great. Mixed up an Old Fashioned for me and seemed proud to do it right. I wish I had known about their reputation for good cocktails as I'd love to try more of them. I guess I'll have to go back soon.\n\nMy girlfriend got the bouillabaisse which was pretty tasty and she seemed to really enjoy it (I've had better but I'm not holding that against them or anything).\n\nI got the cassoulet which was easily one of the richest things I have ever eaten. It's one of those dishes that is so good you know you'll be burping it up all night with a pang of regret but you cannot stop eating it because it's just so unbelievably rich and delicious. The only thing I didn't like about it was the house-made sausage that came with it. It was like a light liver sausage that I'm sure would have pleased a palate more accustomed to it, but I could have done without it.\n\nAll told, the food rated between very good and excellent, the drinks were well done, we were treated well by the bartender, and I really enjoyed the ambiance and architecture. I will certainly return.",

I had been looking forward to checking this place out since it had opened a few months ago.  I like BBQ and sandwiches (although I'm no BBQ aficionado) and I went in with an open mind.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, my friend and I were greeted by the manager and were immediately seated.  We then met our server who was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful.\n\nFor an app we ordered the fried pickles which came with ranch dressing and another dipping sauce.  They were really good and got me excited for the meal.\n\nI ordered the hamburger, only because I wasn't in the mood for a huge meal and my friend ordered the brisket.  I got an order of mac and cheese as my side.  When my burger came, it was dressed pretty basically with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  The burgers aren't cooked to order, and the one I had was pretty dry and over cooked.  It wasn't juicy at all and I didn't even finish it.  The mac and cheese was good, but it wasn't overly spectacular.  My friend ordered potato salad with the brisket, which I tried, and could tell that it was likely store bought (which isn't horrible, but I've had better).\n\nAll in all, the place was a solid three stars.  The staff was amazing, the atmosphere is nice and the food came quickly.  I was sad to see that there weren't more people in here.  I really am rooting for this place, especially because I think the Westbank needs an \"authentic\" BBQ place.",

  "text": "We ordered the Creole Trio and a 1/2 oyster 1/2 shrimp po boy to split. The trio had red beans and rice, gumbo, and jambalaya. The gumbo was my favorite. It was loaded with sausage. The jambalaya was flavorful, but the rice was too mushy. I liked the beans, but prefer them creamier. That is a personal preference so I don't hold that against them. \n\nThe po boy had enough shrimp, but only three small fried oysters. I know the price of oysters has gone up. The first oyster po boy we had during our trip was also lacking in the oyster department AND they added a $2 up charge. At least Desire did not have an up charge. \n\nOur server was quick and friendly. \n\nThey have decent beers on tap. \n\nIt was a quick place to stop and was pretty good. 3 1/2 stars.",

Underneath the foil is some wax or other material that they light on fire with a lighter to finish it off so it is at peak taste when the foil is pulled back and the amazing aromas greet you. And then when you bite in deep, the taste is full and juicy.",

Needless to say I had a great time here and thankfully I did take a picture of my rolls to help piece together the blurry evening. The servers were friendly and very attentive in the beginning of our meal, towards the end the service slowed down and we found ourselves sitting around waiting for our checks to come back. \n\nJackson's doubles as a night club at night. I have never had a bad time here and I tend to find an older crowd here, which is refreshing in comparison to the 18 and up crowd at some other bars in the area. \n\nJackson's also offers a pretty good brunch on the weekends. It's all you can eat stations for about $22-$35 a person (I can't remember exactly) and does not include drinks.  They have everything from sushi to carving stations to a chocolate fountain. My favorite part of dinning here during the day is sitting outside since the restaurant is located right on the water. This is a great place for a more upscale brunch. I think Jackson's could be a #1 brunch spot if they offered an 'all you can drink special' with brunch since this seems to be a very popular option right now.",

I don't know if it was our skin color or what, but we felt something...Waitress greets us and was like rushing us to order. We ordered Pate, coquille saint jacques, garlic custard, stuff shrimp, onion soup, and the mussel which were cold you can tell it was sitting for a little while... After we ate a table next to us order the same mussell dish, to our suprise it came with a small fork and a big bowl to toss the shell....and we got crap!!! The best french food we've had in a long time since living in Tahiti and we are american/french!!!

With that being said, I was pretty impressed with the bagel quality at this spot in St Pete! Crispy on the outside and nicely toasted inside with ample thickness, it really would have no trouble fitting in on any NYC street corner. Also had a large iced coffee that was Texas-sized gigantic and well priced. Would love to return!",

  "text": "Let's start with the good things-I came on a Tuesday morning with absolutely no wait. We ordered right away and were happy to have our food within 10 minutes of ordering. We started our breakfast with the BONUTS and all the Yelp reviews were right, they're DELICIOUS and a must try! The cheesy grits that came with my meal were good and the biscuit was yummy too. The portions of food were good for me but I defiantly wouldn't take my powerlifting husband here, he would starve. The place is cute and clean and the staff were all warm and friendly! \n\nNow the not so good, the price you pay for what you get is outrageous. When you go to a breakfast spot you expect good coffee but unfortunately the people I was with said it was burnt, terrible, and undrinkable. Their cups were still full and left on the table when we walked out. \n\nOverall, the coffee and the cost will keep me from coming back.",

My boyfriend and I both had the pork place and were very impressed. I tried the moonshine mojito and it was really good. The bartender takes his time with the drinks and a lot of them featured fresh mint. \n\nThe downsides were that the Mac and cheese was bland and a little cold and they don't have brisket at dinner time. I would still recommend checking it out!",

  "text": "Currently staying here and I felt obligated to write this review after my last two experiences. The hotel is nice. Upon arrival, a man with a wizard like cape will greet you and gather your bags to escort you to check in. The hotel allowed us to check in early without question so that was nice. The room itself is basic and nothing to speak of. THe hotel is undergoing renovations so it has a few places that look undesirable.\n\nThe bellhop staff is great and very helpful, Especially, Ebanks. However, the front desk staff is just average. \n\nNow, to what sparked me to write this interview.. There are no vending machines or microwaves in this building. I am 8 months pregnant and those thins are essential. How can I not be able to buy snacks when I need them? All of he walking you do here, a vending machine is necessary as it is annoying as ____ to have to walk to local stores to get bottled water. Also, there is no microwave available for guests to use. This is major as NOLA is a prime place to eat and staying here, you would not be able to reheat any of the delicious food you purchase. Right now I'm looking at lobster Mac and cheese and stuffed red fish that I cannot eat because there is no microwave. Honestly, this is a major turn off for me and for that reason, I would never stay here again. Obviously, I'm pissed, but for 1200 dollars for two people , I need a microwave. Rant over!",

Casual atmosphere, decent prices. We got a booth, and the side I sat on there was a big pillar and made it annoying to get in and out. Our server forgot my soda order, it was 9:00 PM And maybe six people total there. Aside from that the snow crab legs we ordered were amazing. So good! The fries were nuked and dried out. The potatoes were questionable so we passed. For three lbs between two of us and two sodas came out to $60. Great place for laid back dinner and great crab legs.

  "text": "OK I don't understand why the star ratings so far are so bad if everyone is saying they really liked the food. Maybe the ratings are from competitors?\n\nSo here is the REAL blow-by-blow breakdown of this place.\n\nYES it is mobbed. That's because there is a HUGE HUGE HUGE pent-up demand for fast casual Mexican in Tampa, and people are flocking there. After all, let us review our options for fast Mexican food in Tampa Bay: \n\n1. Chipotle = Sodium-filled food, pre-cooked and later boiled in plastic bags. A digestive nightmare.\n\n2. Tijuana Flats/Moe's = Can't really tell the difference between these crapholes; \nboth are substandard Mex joints that would go out of business in California, Texas, etc.\n\n3. Taco Bus = Tasteless food served in cardboard tortillas in a dirty restaurant.YUM!\n\n\nBut back to Lime Fresh:\n\nDo not just show up. Place your order online before you head over there. When you get there, go to the back of the restaurant where the takeout cashier is. Pay for your food there, take it to a table, and eat. This took me 5 minutes. And watch everyone else wait in line for 30 minutes. I had the chicken soft tacos and my friend had the chicken cobb salad. Both were good. Both tasted fresher than any food at the above-mentioned places.\n \nLime Fresh is not the same as Moe's, Tijuana Flats or Chipotle. It is much much better. Is it the best Mexican food you have ever had? NO. Is it authentic Mexican, Cal-Mex, Tex-Mex, etc.? NO. Is it better than the fast food Mexican food in Texas, Arizona, California, etc.? NO. But is it better than Chipotle, Tijuana Flats, etc.?\nYES!!!!!!!\n\nThe ingredients here are much fresher than at Chipotle and Tijuana Flats, you can taste it. (Well, let's face it, the food from Chipotle comes already cooked in plastic bags, which they later boil.) The execution with some of the meats at Lime Fresh is not there yet, but I am hopeful they will get better with that.\n\nThis place is automatically better than the above mentioned places JUST for the extensive salsa bar, which is standard in Cali, Ariz, Texas, etc. but most no one else in Tampa has. And the pico de gallo is pretty decent, as are the other salsas. The menu is extensive, the dining space is nice and huge, the online order process was seamless.\n\nI would def. go back when it's off-peak hours.",

I had the Dolce De Leche tart and it was so rich and filling, plus the presentation was beautiful--they clearly put a lot of care into how all of their treats look as well as taste. They have espresso drinks and teas too. I got a small Matcha latte which was actually quite big, so that was a nice surprise.

They do accept air miles so that's a positive. they should install accessible doors though for wheelchair users and strollers. a friend went there this weekend and just told us that he is never going back there... and yeah i would advise you to stay away from the bar side...stay far far away. they don't pay attention and they just stand there and chat with each other. the last time we were there the tables were filthy and there weren't very many customers there. there was us and another group playing pool and did i mention the not so clean plates and utensils???their patio?? not clean! common people do u need John Taffer to rescue you?  eeekkk....",

They led a group of eight to a table that barely fit six.  We refused to sit there, and were told we would have to wait for another table. We had reservations.\n\nI went to the bar for a beer for my wait.  I was second in line at an empty bar.  After assuring me he would be just a second then skipping over me (cash in hand) to help two other patrons who just walked up, I finally got my beer fifteen minutes later.\n\nFor the price, I expect better service that we were offered that night.  The food was just average.  \n\nI would not return, as there are far better Italian restaurants in town (Buca, Vito's, even.....dare I say it.... Olive Garden)",

Even in the cold, the baristas meet you at your car to take your order. Inside the shop (if you have the time), you are surrounded by coffee drinking locals, local art, and great conversation.\n\nNot the best place to go to study or work but it can be done after their morning rush.",

We were there for two hours and got three drinks -- not for lack of finishing them, but for lack of our server checking on us at all. By the time we got our third drink there were 3 sets of empty glasses on the table because she never took anything back. Dirty plates sat on our table from when we finished our food until when we left. We even turned the call server light on in hopes of getting her attention. That was a waste as she walked past three times without paying attention. When confronted, she told us she had been waiting the tables outside but we were sat by the window and could see that she had not been out there. We had been anticipating a fun night out and dollar drinks to celebrate a new job, but we were thoroughly let down.",

  "text": "Underwhelming and overpriced. Pizza Fusion seems to have a lot of hype and a lot of potential but it is poorly executed. I would give them 2.5 stars... most people would round to 3, but I'm sticking to two because my experience wasn't really \"A-OK.\"\n\nEven with a Creative Loafing deal AND a nightly special, I feel like we really overpaid... $27 for a large Do-It-Yourself Pizza alone. How is that possible? This is how: they don't tell you on the menu that the base pizza is $12 (I looked for pricing and there was none). They do tell you that each topping is between $2 and $4 (or more), but you would expect that to be the full cost of the pizza since only those prices are listed, leaving ours at $15 but alas it was actually almost twice that much. Dang! The final product was good, but for that price I can get three equally good take out pizzas. When you add my small white pizza to the mix, our bill was ridiculously high. I do not recommend this place unless you have a CL voucher. They are priced high assuming you will have one. Here is the link: http://www.cldeals.com/products/valid-at-pizza-fusion-downtown-tampa-25-value-2\n\nWant to know something else they don't tell you? The soda is not normal coke product. It's their supposedly organic version, which tastes like a flat diet coke with a whole cup of Truvia added to it... like a previous reviewer said, it's basically cough syrup. They really should tell us this when we order. My \"diet coke\" was so gross I cringed when I took the first sip and literally could not force myself to get it down. I have never felt that way about any other soda or drink for that matter. Trust me, I know what Truvia tastes like as I use daily it in my shakes and cooking... and I know it's better than aspartame... but this was WAY TOO MUCH TRUVIA! I was so turned off by this product. Yuck.\n\nThe service was pleasant but super slow/sparce and we watched as everyone was served before us. As for the food itself, it was alright but honestly not amazing. I wasn't blown away. Also, I ordered the wheat crust and got the regular one on my pizza... didn't make it an issue, but it added to the overall annoyances. \n\nI really wanted to like this place. I really did. But Pizza Fusion and I are not meant to be. I won't give them good reviews just because they offer gluten-free items.\n\nSummary: okay food, kinda bad service, really bad value, overall a super MEH experience.",

There were some fresh greens and sliced tomatoes to add a little brightness too. Hubs ordered a grilled chicken sand which, cooked fresh to order- it looked really good. I heard no complaints. Coffee was good and refilled promptly. Honestly, this has been my best food experience in awhile!",

  "text": "I was looking through the YELP reviews trying to find something interesting to try.  I  stumbled onto \"Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop\".  I think my search was focused on corny names.  Anyhow, based on the good reviews, we stopped in on a Saturday evening.  Easily the best decision I made all week.\n\nThe food was awesome!\n\nThe \"Stop\"  is located in a strip mall just north of the I-10 Causeway cloverleaf.  There is a well lit sign on the east side of the cloverleaf.  If you are coming from I-10 you have a choice, You can make an illegal u-turn, dive into the right lane and pull up to the front of the restaurant.  The faint of heart can make a legal left turn, make the next two lefts and pull right up next to the strip mall .\n\nThis is a relatively small place.  Maybe 20 seats, a couple more at the bar. Decor stretches the boundaries of eclectic.....  We obviously missed the dinner rush, I think maybe 3 - 4 people were seated when we arrived.  We sat right next to the mermaid.  \n\nService was quick and friendly.  Someone I assume is Chef Ron was out a couple of times to check on us.  Nice, polite but not clingy - no war stories or life histories.  Interesting that he assumed we were from out of town (must be worldly demeanor and classic good looks).  When he found out we were from Destrehan, he commented that \"he loved to get locals in\".\n\nDown to the food - nothing short of great.  All the reviews raving about the seafood gumbo is absolutely accurate. The turkey wrap was enormous and stuffed full of real turkey.  My real find was the potato salad.  This is the best potato salad I have had in New Orleans.   \n\n$50 for 2 including drinks and tips.  I'm excited about going back and trying some of the other sides.",

Turns out we were the first to arrive and they had given our section away to crashers, It was almost funny to see the hostess and servers disappear into hiding and leaving us standing there awkwardly looking over the people that had our table. Fair play to the female bartender that finally addressed us and offered to seat us at he bar. Since we had kids and a wheelchaired person, we left and walked into Gators to be seated instantly.",

It can sometimes be fantastic and other times be unbearably bad. I understand that they get very busy, however, waiting after being seated for 45+ minutes on multiple occasions to give an order without being noticed is almost inexcusable. Additionally, after the food is brought to you, don't expect to see your server again until you're paying; only a handful of times have they actually come back to check on the food.

It seems to have an echo due to the concrete floors and high ceiling.  We ordered the Antipasto Misto for starters. It was ok.  My husband had Farfalle Alla Milanese, he seemed to like it.  I thought it was nasty!! It had an overwhelming odor of pancetta (bacon.) It was weighed down with fatty heavy sauce.  Almost like they rendered out the fat from the pancetta and the sausage and used every drop to make the sauce. YUK!  I had the Pollo Alla Gino-Vese, it was pretty good.  Slightly over cooked and salty but over all it was good.  Mine also came with a side of spaghetti (which I did not eat.  It tasted canned.) Our server was super sweet! lol She even commented on my husband's dish.  She said that she hates serving it because the smell gags her.  We had a nice time there.  We did not leave hungry and our bill was $68 and we had drinks.  Not horrible but not amazing! PS... bring a sweater because it is down right COLD in there!!",

  "text": "It's weird: Much of what's going on with my life is a complete surprise to even myself.  I wasn't supposed to be in New Orleans or be staying with my friend whom I hit up last minute, but somehow we ended up here when I was already pretty shithoused, running with our umbrellas trying to beat the impending storm that never came.  The outside area upstairs is cool with a view of the Mississippi River (always makes me think of Tom Sawyer or one of those books).  However, there is only one dingy table outside AND, it's the target blasting area of some sort of restaurant ventilation so if you look cute, keep in mind that you will leave smelling like greasy french fries which makes you less cute.  \n\nDrinks are like $10 each.  EXPENSIVE!  And small sized like but I was drunk already so no harm no foul.  Mojitos are better than margaritas.  It's a huge space inside but not many people upstairs.",

All-in, over two hours before we had something to eat and it was basically fast food quality cuisine. It was almost comical how many things were wrong with our order when it finally arrived. In summary, mediocre  fast food without the speed and poor service.\n\n Additionally, bathrooms were disgusting. First and last trip to Buffalo Wild Wings.",

  "text": "Five stars for this location easily! Not sure why it took me so long to contribute to the reviews of this place, but better late than never. Everyone at this location is friendly and it's always sincere. Aside from having customer service that would shame some high end Philadelphia restaurants the food here is great. It is delivered efficiently, hot, and cooked properly. I personally am addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich and love to dip my fires in the Chick-fil-A Sauce. I also like that this location has family friendly nights: my favorite is taking my daughter to the annual father daughter date night around Valentine's. My little girl and I look forward to it - probably me more than her she is five and has no sense of time. I also really like their milk shakes and breakfast sandwich selections. Keep up the good work team Chick-fil-A, it isn't going unnoticed or unappreciated!",

Luckily I had been twice before bad or would not have gone back.  The night it was bad I happened to take 2 people who have never been I felt horrible for raving how good it was as they won't be back.  I ordered the same item I had 2 weeks prior and it was awful.  Most likely the inconsistency is in whoever is the chef that day?  Overall I would say it is good but I do agree with the other reviews that it is not as good as when it first opened and it is a weak wine pour. Great Atmosphere and outdoor tables.  The service is good and staff friendly.  Their French Onion soup may be one of best ever had and a great bloody mary.  My lunches have been better then dinners.  Worth a try.  \nLarge groups - go elsewhere they do discourage groups especially at lunch. Place is to small and not set up to accommodate anything other than a prefix menu for a party over 6.",

We ordered our lunches to go, but I liked the setting and there is tons of seating both inside and outside.  \n\nAlbacore Sandwich - pretty good, a little salty. I think they could've used better bread like pretzel wheat so it wouldn't get soggy to fast.  It started falling apart halfway through \n\nArugula Salad - nice and refreshing.  It's a pretty simple salad so the dressing made the salad what it was.  I wish the portions were bigger since it was pretty expensive for something I could easily make at home.\n\nThe service wasn't my favorite part of the restaurant.  There wasn't a long line, but the cashiers seemed to rush us.  They didn't welcome us or say 'thank you' at all.  I don't know about you, but that leaves a pretty big impression on me especially when the food wasn't amazing.\n\nI would go back to try their baked desserts though!!",

  "text": "Presentation of the Place: The Bathrooms are nice. It reminds you of  an overpriced hotel that you can feel fancy in while taking a dump. The inside of the place reminds me of an amalgamation of the sets of Cheers, Sex in the City, and some French Noir.\n\nThe Food: \n\nStarter:\n\nJumbo Lump Crab Deviled Eggs\n\nSo, this is the first of many dishes were the common complaint is the lack of salt in the food. From the egg, filling, and crab itself, everything was void of salt or seasoning except for what was a little paprika. The textures are boring and 1 dimensional. For 8 dollars, you are getting 3 deviled eggs at the lowest effort of innovation and care. It is something with less flavor and passion than the ones you are partaking in during Thanksgiving at your grandmas.\n\nBrussels Sprouts with Garlic Aioli and Grated Parmesan.\n\nThe Brussels sprouts are cooked exceptional well, which is rare. This is ruined, by the lack of salt and seasoning again. I assume this is due to the amount of Parmesan shaved on top of the dish. This gives the dish an overwhelming umami flavor, and it forces you to reach for the garlic aioli to counter it. After about 10 bites, you begin to realize how white you are because you are essentially eating cheese and mayo. \n\n\nEntrees:\n\nRatatouille with filet\n\nNo salt on the filet on top. No salt in the dish itself. What is on the Filet is a lot of balsamic vinegar, which is overpowering. The tomato paste hasn't been stewed long enough, so the dish is really acidic especially with the amount of balsamic vinegar being used.  \n\nQuail and Boudin\n\nThis dish is weird. If you ever had a fever dream and was wondering man I wish I could eat that, this is what it taste like. The portion of boudin and quail you get is actual small for the price. Guess what the quail doesn't have on it? The fry on the quail isn't good and the breading breaks offs. The chicken gumbo taste so strange like they almost put soy sauce in it and also has notes of sour. The boudin is really good and is the oasis in this odd dish. \n\n\nDrinks:\n\n1 Bottle of the Smith and Hook. Your standard Cabernet nothing flashy.\n \nService: \n\nI usually don't critique service. I understand that we all take breaks at work, but man no water refills, the restaurant isn't busy, and people from the pass are having to bring our food. This is happening while you and your bartender friend are talking the entire time. Not a good look hombre.  \n\nVerdict: A Salty No\n\nIf you want to have a glass of wine with the girls or boys, while you look out at Poydras St. I guess this is the place for you. In my opinion, there are far better options location and culinary wise for you to go to.",

I ordered a green chile lotaburger and onion rings.\n\nI was really disappointed in the burger. I got a single patty and maybe I should've gotten a double. The patty was thin and dry, not much meat on the burger at all. The bun was huge, way too much bread. They were generous with the toppings, but a burger should feature the meat. The green chiles had a nice kick. And the onion rings were decent. Three burgers, two drinks, and two orders of rings was just over $20. Maybe a tad pricey considering the drinks and rings were size small, and my mom got the little (itsa) burger.\n\nNo issues with the service. It was okay, not especially friendly. No real response from the cashier when we mentioned it was our first time either. If I come back, I may try the breakfast burritos and hope they're better than the burger.",

Also been here late night for drinks, bartender was knowledgeable and attentive. \n\nBack again for lunch. Seated right away even though place looked pretty full.  Food was hot and taste great. Can't say anything particularly stood out besides the whiskey selection.  I'd come back for lunch before dinner.\n\nPork sandwich was tasty but a little dry. Flavor was very unique. Prices are expected for this area. Our server Kaillie was awesome. The gal bringing out the food acted like she didn't want to be there. Everyone seemed to be fine.",

My Cold Brew was smooth, rich with coffee flavor.  Many selections to choose from....they grind and blend Petite Clouet Coffee.\nThe coffee condiment bar had Agave syrup, simple syrup, several choices of milk products and other types of sugar/sugar substitutes.\nEverything in the cafe was absolutely top quality with affordable prices.  Outside seating, lots of seat choices inside, a very nice knowledable Barista, dog friendly and a fantastic location.....this Petite Clouet Cafe is not to be missed.\nP.S.

  "text": "Hubs and I chose this place because it popped up on a YELP list of best places to watch football. YELP is absolutely WRONG about this. Walked in at noon on NFL Sunday, and two of the three bar big screens were tuned to soccer, one of the ancillary screens is tuned to soccer, and one of the ancillary screens is tuned to women's collegiate volleyball. The few screens tuned to football were tuned to the Titans, and I totally get that in Nashville, but when our server asked what game we wanted because she was willing to change the screen from volleyball, she said they couldn't do it because they don't have Sunday Ticket. This absolutely disqualifies Burger Republic as a football watching bar. Also, just putting a bunch of screens up around the place doesn't qualify it as a sports bar. Sight lines are important. Food was solid. Service was acceptable. But don't go here thinking you're going to watch football.",

The atmosphere is very laid back and almost has a beach shack feel (if that makes sense).\n\nThe menu is average size and straightforward.  I got 3 grilled fish tacos ($4 each).  I am always hesitant at paying more than $3 per taco but since it was on the company's dime I figured why not.  I have to say I was impressed.  The fish was crispy from the grill despite having the chipotle remoulade on top (always a plus), and the fillets were nice and meaty with no bones.  The red cabbage was fresh and added a needed crunch. \n\nTo me this place is the perfect spot for a quick lunch.

  "text": "Been here a few times now. Every single experience has been wonderful!\n\nThe food and service has been exceptional each time. This last visit we enjoyed live Italian style opera singing. It was very unexpected and fun, definitely not something you typically see at a restaurant chain. \n\nEvery time we've come we couldn't leave less than a 20% tip, these waiters and waitresses are not just nice they are truly genuine. They aren't over the top, with a cheesy \"hello and how may I help you's\" only to scurry from the table as quickly as possible. They genuinely smile and make conversation, have impeccable timing and attentiveness even on a busy Friday night, and know how to make recommendations from the menu. Really wish we could note all their names individually to give them props. \n\nThe food is fully flavorful, not just salty. The bread is warm a loaded with rosemary flavor, I always request balsamic with my dipping Olive oil. Each dish has a unique flavor profile not just your typical Italian style chain where the only options are salty cheesy or salty tomato. People have complained about portion size/cost ratio on other reviews but honestly, I have never left here anything less than STUFFED with left overs for lunch the next day. We typically spend $55-$60 on two specialty drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees (my choice usually being a seafood/lobster dish) at dinner, not shabby at all when you consider the customer service, atmosphere, quality, AND quantity at that price. \n\nIf you suffered a bad experience here, I am strongly advising you give it a second/third shot and even mention your last experience to your waiter when you come in, I'm positive a place like this will make it up to you. This is probably my favorite restaurant of the moment. Totally worth the five star review I'm giving it.",

  "text": "I'll summarize with these categories: \nFood - Very good. \nService - Very good but hurried. \nAtmosphere - DEAFENING noise. \n\nOur first visit was this Friday evening. I had heard rave reviews so we were anxious to try it out. We had reservations and were seated immediately. The place was absolutely jammed with people. The noise level was deafening. Having a conversation without raising your voice was impossible. The hustle and bustle of waitstaff going by every second does not make for a relaxing atmosphere. Too many tables jammed into this space. \n\nOur waitress was very good and attentive. However, we felt rushed. Probably because there were so many people waiting in the bar to be seated. \n\nThe food was very good. Mussel appetizer was just ok. Good quantity of mussels, but some were still closed. The sauce was tasty but lacked chunks of tomatoes. My crabmeat & shrimp over pasta was one of the best I've ever had. Dessert was also very good. Portions for all were more than enough. \n\nIf you want good food, visit Limocello. If you want a quiet evening or a relaxing atmosphere - STAY AWAY. Maybe weekdays are better. I'm sure they could do more to cut down on the noise. The ceilings are low, but the owner has placed acoustical tiles on the perimeter to reduce noise. Something else needs to be done. It's a shame because we couldn't wait to get out of there. I'm not sure I would go again.",

  "text": "For my Two Hundredth review I give \"The Block\".  Cute name cute inside cute little meat case with cute little chunks of meat.  The service was not so cute.  The server wished she was anywhere but here waiting on us.  I feel your pain it is hard to work for a living.  But if you are not a people person than maybe you need to sit in a cube somewhere and not waiting on people with your lousy attitude and pathetically slow to non existent service.  What saves this place from something less than 3 stars is the food was very good.  I had their steak sandwich..  It was very good.  Odd instead of one slice of steak it was pieces of steak placed on the bread.  I almost felt it was leftovers from the butcher shop.  But style or not the steak was very good.  It had a nice punch to it from the pepper they seasoned it with and the gardinaire it was served with.  The steak sandwich came with fries so I asked for some ketchup.  It came out in one of those little stainless steel cups that was about 25% full.  So after about 2 fries I needed more.  Good luck with that.  Refer to server section of the review. \n\nMy son The Famous Chip K. was with me anid told me he had this server before and she was bad.  Oh well.  So go for the food not the service.  Really it is cute in a cute way",

  "text": "Since our experience was brunch, not the hotel itself, I hesitated to write this review. However, after reading the reviews of others, I feel our experience represents what others have said & felt so here goes. \n\nChristmas brunch: $75. We had no reservations & can now see why they weren't booked up.\n\nOnly soups were a gumbo & squash. Soup was tepid, soup \"bar\" messy. There was a large bread bar & I found a good yeasty roll. The gumbo was full of shrimp, sausage. (Later the waitress told me she could heat anything. That's nice but shouldn't be necessary.) The staff seemed overworked (we were initially led to the wrong table -- people were EATING there), but by & large tried really hard to accommodate. $75 included unlimited mimosas & my glass was never wanting. \n\nIt's hard to explain the worn, tired, outdated, rather unkept appearance. Like where we were finally seated along the wall, there were bumps in the carpet from electrical or whatever, but dust had accumulated. I even made the comment that I smelled moth balls. Hubby pointed to the, rather outdated in my opinion, cloth decorations on the tables/buffets. Made sense to me. \n\nHubby was delighted w/ the fresh oysters. Also the shrimp and crawfish. His omelette looked appetizing. Most desserts were to die for! The pralines were tasty but grainy and I've had better macaroons. My egg on artichoke was not properly cooked. The broccoli was hard, and too garlicky as was the cornbread stuffing. \n\nPictures are worth. . .",

  "text": "In a nutshell - lovely ambience. HORRIBLE food and service.\nWe went there couple days back while on vacation and fell in love with the ambience. Very relaxing,  setting a mood, the numerous lanterns and seating on cushions with low tables. Very Asian and Arabic at the same time. \n\nBut the food was horrible. The 4 of us were unanimous about our opinion of the food. Tasteless , nothing special and the simplest mango lassi too was horrible. More over the server dumped mango juice into the lassi and gave us the glass and told us to mix it with the straw. We had to ask him to turn on the candle at our table too. (It was 8pm). We asked him about a dish that was mentioned on the menu posted outside the restaurant not on the card menu. He quickly said \"yeah we can make it\" and rushed to another table where there were non indians sitting. Throughout our stay there we observed him serving the non indians and caring a damn about any desis.\n\nWe told him that the lassi was no good and he said. \"I don't know , I'll tell them inside\" .... whatever that means...\n\nWe heard him send customers away saying he is short on service. That was true ,he was the only guy waiting 8 tables aprrox. BUT. Why did such a big restaurant have just one server... ? Poor fellow seemed like a nervous reck. \n\nSo unless u want to take ur shoes off and just have a fun time criticizing the service and food do not go to this restaurant. Period.",

Although it was very crowded, like all the restaurants in the French Quarter at noon, we got a table and good service. She didn't rush us, and it did not take too long to get our food. Unlike some of the comments below stating it was over priced, I found that to be the furthest from the truth. Seems to be everything was $12. The Po-Boys were HUGE! I shared one with my sister, and we could not finish it. My other sister ordered red beans and rice, which was very good, and another large portion, we all ended up sharing it. The burgers were also extremely large, at least 1/2 pound. The food was good, service was good, and they do not charge an automatic gratuity for 4 people. They have listed at the bottom of the bill a  gratuity calculation of 18% and 20% for your convenience. Perhaps it is for those people who stiff the server with a couple of bucks, or for people who cannot figure out what 20% of the cost is. I would recommend this restaurant.",

  "text": "I ate here for the first time when I visited Philly a couple weeks ago. It was my first BYOB experience and that was AWESOME! It's a really busy/crowded restaurant and we went for Brunch so there was no exception. Luckily my friend was able to call ahead to put our name in for a party of seven. We could track our spot on the waiting list through their text messaging system which was definitely convenient. By the time we made it to the restaurant there was only one party ahead of us. However, we still ended up waiting at least 45 minutes because it seems that there is limited seating for larger groups. \n\nWhen we finally got our table we immediately took our bottles out ready to get our drank on! The waitress opened our champagne bottle for us in the back and we ordered a couple juices to go with it. We also brought vodka, which went great with their delicious bloody mary mix. \n\nFor brunch, they had a TON of veggie options which was amazing!! The variety was great! They also have a \"Specials\" Menu which had the potential to be really cool, but it seems like it's just the same specials and regular recipes that they usually make where they just change the names of the items to a new theme. The food still looked pretty good though. \n\nI ordered the Ultimate Mexi Scramble. I was really excited about this dish as the description made it look delicious. I really enjoyed the black bean grits that came with the dish. The scramble itself was pretty good, but also a little bit too liquidy. The portion of food was large which was great because we were all starving after having waited to get a table for so long. The rest of my friends at the table seemed to really enjoy their food. \n\nI enjoyed my experience at Sabrina's Cafe for the most part. I really liked the BYOB policy. the food wasn't AMAZING in my opinion, but it was still pretty darn good. The only thing that was frustrating was the wait to actually get a table. It may be worth it for the restaurant to consider taking reservations for parties larger than 6.",

The service was terrific, even apologizing for the delay in the food, (which I didn't even think we were waiting that long). One of the \"brothers \" was opening the door for ppl in a downpour, asking tables (and us) if we needed anything. Great Customer service & food =&  .",

  "text": "Went at high noon on a workday before we headed to the airport. Waited 45 minutes for some of the very BEST BBQ we have ever had.\nI had the 8 oz brisket sandwich, loaded tater tots and jambalaya. Brisket was tender, juicy, tasteful and plentiful. Tater tots were ok but the jambalaya was delicious!!\nWife had the smoked turkey sandwich that was very moist with a wonderful light smoked flavor.\nDaughter-in-law had the pulled pork sandwich, loaded tater tots and beans. Very tasty pork! This coming from someone who has eaten plenty of pork of the past 20 years in NC. The beans, mixed variety, were seasoned nicely. Could have cooked them a few minutes longer though.\nIf you go at lunch expect to wait and share a bench table with other patrons. I do not recommend taking a toddler as there is no kids menu nor a place for them to sit.\nWe will be back the next time we are in St Louis!",

Not bad beer by any stretch of the imagination but more meh than memorable, unfortunately.\n\nService: this is a pet peeve of mine- if you're serving these beers, be proud & smart & able to answer questions about the brewing etc! I have yet to see this here. The young girls can answer basic questions w/ canned responses but go blank beyond that. We sat with empty glasses at the bar for uncomfortably long (they were not busy at all) and by the time she reached us, decided to get our check instead of another round. \n\nFood: not served, but menu from neighboring sushi place provided.",

I feel like it is trying too hard to be one of those hip coffee shops, but its not quite there.  Again, nothing terrible or fantastic about the place, just okay.  I ended up getting the iced Black Thunder coffee.  It was good, but I have had better iced coffee at other local places.

  "text": "This location is a little hard to get into due to the construction and general traffic around US-19 and Gulf to Bay. Its parking lot desperately needs to be repainted as there are parking spots on one side of the building that really isn't wide enough to hold parking plus the traffic of cars actually driving by.\n\nThe food is really good. I've had their chicken biscuit a number of times, and find it is better than many other fast food establishments. It is many times better than McDonald's and Burger King and is just as good, if not slightly better, than Chick-fil-A's.\n\nTheir hash browns are nicely seasoned, with some different herbs included, and are very good if they are fresh and hot. Once they've sat for more than a few minutes, they become soggy and unappetizing.\n\nThey have a huge variety of donuts and are constantly rotating different seasonal specials. The donuts are generally fresh although I've gotten a stale donut or two whenever I run by during the late evening.\n\nThe service is friendly, although it is slow! If I place an order inside, they will do three or four cars before finally handing me my order. I dislike that the emphasis is placed on people in the drive-thru, and wish they would have dedicated staff for both sides.",

The cauliflower dish was good, but not as seasoned and flavorful as in other Indian restaurants I've been to. We enjoyed everything overall. Our waitress was polite and helpful.

  "text": "This location has a very easy drive-thru (easy to navigate). However, it was pouring rain when my fiance and I ordered at the drive-thru. Because they did not have an awning or something to block the rain from coming down, I could BARELY hear the drive-thru operator through the speaker. I was straining super hard to hear (and my fiance is almost deaf in one ear so he DEFINITELY could not hear). \n\nWe ordered the pretzel burger sandwich, 4 count of chicken nuggets with honey mustard, a medium Sprite, large fries, medium Diet Pepsi, 8 count of mozzarella sticks, and an order of chicken fries with barbecue sauce.\n\nI see chicken tenders on the menu which is what my fiance wanted to order (although it said 2 count of chicken tenders but he wanted four) and the drive-thru operator said \"Do you mean the nuggets? We don't have chicken tenders\". And we were like \"...No... the tenders...\" and again she said that they didn't have those, so I was confused about that. (Unless she meant they didn't have any left in stock??) \n\nAs for the parking lot: Once you collect your food from the drive-thru window, they only have parking spots available for handicap people to park, and you're only able to turn right out of the lot. If you wanted to eat in the parking lot, you'd have to basically do a square around the corner to come back into their parking lot again.\n\nAs for the food: My fiance liked the pretzel sandwich. They unfortunately did not give him any honey mustard like what he wanted for the chicken nuggets (so he ate those plain). I was pleasantly surprised to see how big a medium drink is (it's definitely like a large in my eyes!) I'm so used to diet drinks that it should taste fairly normal, but my Diet Pepsi tasted different this time, and not in a good way, I don't know... They forgot to give us marinara sauce (which is pictured in the promo for the sticks), so we ate them plain. Finally, my chicken fries were okay, they give more than what I was expecting in the box, but I just felt that they lacked flavor. They didn't taste like anything to be honest... I had a couple of my fiance's fries and those tasted good.",

I have been to this restaurant many times since it opened, and have always had positive experiences, however last night myself and a group of friends sitting at the bar experienced appallingly rude service from the two bartenders. It's a shame because the food here is great and I live only blocks away, but there are plenty of other restaurants in this neighborhood and this city that have a combination of good food and good service. I'm quite confident that the people I was with, who live here and all own businesses in this neighborhood, feel the same way.

  "text": "I was a bit skeptical of this place from the moment it opened. One: the location seems odd to me but maybe it's because I rarely make my way to Marathon Motor village during the day time. Two: the theme. Many Nashville restaurants take advantage of garage-style doors and even have similar themes. The difference? They do it well. Garage coffee company felt more like I was there to get my oil changed than to get a solid cup of coffee. It felt like it was trying to cater a crowd that's non-existent in the Nashville coffee scene. \n\nI often tell people that I have two criteria for liking a coffee shop and it only needs to meet one of them. A) Have a great environment or B) serve a really good product. Garage does neither. Their coffee is  equivalent to a cup you may get at Starbucks, possibly even worse. Sorry, folks.",

  "text": "This restaurant review is really only about the Happy Hour.  Lately, that has been my MO.  In the summer I don't like to eat huge meals so Happy Hours work great.  It's really hard to judge a restaurant correctly this way.  So guys, just remember this was a Happy Hour review and doesn't reflect their true menu.  Went there Friday night with our friends.  It was the four of us all looking to share some delectables.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite make it for us.  We shared the Calamari which was fried but came dry without a sauce, no lemon.  It was tasty but I believe could have been better.  Also the smash burger.  I couldn't understand why they called it that.  Except that is a new term for a trend in burgers these days.  Since one is opening up in town with just that name (Smash Burger) on Grant and Swan.The burger was very plain and tasteless.  Also ordered the Mahi tacos which just got a so so for us.  The highlight was the fish and chips.  Actually, the fish was made to perfection.  Crispy, dry on the outside with a beautiful white fish inside.  I'd highly recommend that.  The fries were very plain and ordinary to say the least.  Ordered the salad on the happy hour and it was totally bland. I would come back just for the fish and disregard the chips. The service was fine.  We had a lovely, cheery server.  The place is trendy and quite lovely with the views of the mountains.  By the time we left the place was hopping mostly at the bar.  It is definitely worthwhile going to.  I love to see Restaurants do well here in Tucson. I will be back.  I'm not trying to bad mouth this place but  because I am an honest reviewer I might be coming off a little harsh.   I will be back and get the fish and try some other interesting dishes.  They do have an extensive selection of Happy Hour dishes.  Even more than other restaurants.  So certainly it is worth coming here and enjoying this trendy spot.",

I've always found the service to be decent, and the food quality is on par with other quick-serve Mexican fast food restaurants of its kind.  Qdoba has made an effort in recent years to change their menu and have it keep pace with changing customer tastes and dining habits.  I usually stick with the tried & true menu items, like the Queso burrito.  It's not exactly calorie-friendly, but it's a crowd pleaser.",

But honestly, I go here 2-3 times a week and it never gets old. It's pretty hard to find a place that has sushi AND hibachi that doesn't cost a fortune per person.. \n\nAnyways, I always get the same thing: crunchy roll + miso and my boyfriend gets hibachi steak & shrimp (which comes with fried rice, hibachi veggies, and miso).. The grand total generally comes out to be about $25. **if it's during their lunch special (which lasts until 4:00 on weekdays, it's about $19)... ENOUGH SAID.\n\nI honestly have nothing bad to say about this place, they never ever disappoint. I highly recommend it!!",

I was a bit nervous about the food due to this, but the food was actually very very good.\n\nI started with a sangria rita (2 of my favorite things mixed together).  It was a very large drink and for the size, I don't think that the $9 price tag was too bad.  We started with the sriracha guacamole (YUM) and the loaded queso (it had bacon in it) and both were very tasty.  For my meal I had the grilled avocado (filled with fresh ahi tuna and crema sauce) and the Mexican street corn.  The ahi tuna was SO incredibly fresh and the avocado was just perfect - highly recommend this dish.  The Mexican street corn was also very well done and quite scrumptious!  Everyone at my table was happy with their meals from tacos to salads.\n\nOur server was very sweet and was prompt on refilling our chips and getting us anything we requested.   Honestly, I had a very good experience here and I look forward to coming back in the future.",

I'm also not so sure why they're using chopped iceburg lettuce on the burger since chopped lettuce creates a serious bun slippage problem.

Leave regret in your rearview mirror and don't EVER question your decision to drive the extra 17 minutes to Asian Buffet. \n\nSure it's going to cost $1 more, but that's what it takes to avoid the deep sadness I'm feeling right now.  The differences between a $7.99 and $8.99 experience are astounding:\n\nFor starters, eating in a poorly planned cafeteria setting with power cords all over the walls and very misleading food images posted in the windows as you enter VS a modest exterior and an immediate eyeful of a buffet that punches you in the face with possibilities before you're brought to one of three separate dining areas.\n\nSecondly, taking a first plate that already feels like you've settled for disappointment and shouda, woulda, coulda's VS a first plate that hasn't even scratched the surface of what looked delicious.\n\nThird, did I mention how sad I am right now??\n\nFourth, 2 servers, 1 hibachi/sushi chef and 1 buffet attendant VS more staff than you can shake a stick at.  Don't get me wrong, this place has really nice servers but something has to make up for the stingy buffet tables they can't afford to even keep half full...\n\n...and that's where I'll finish this up.  Compared to Asian Buffet, this place is a food desert and I had to fight through a scattered mess of fried or cheese covered insanity to find anything remotely Asian and/or healthy.  The move by places like this to cheapen their culinary culture to feed a bunch of fat Americans more calories than Asians will consume in a week is disgusting on so many levels.

The special includes your choice of a fried yummy treat and soup.  I ordered the moo goo gai pan with crab rangoons and egg drop soup.  This combo is one of my personal faves.  I can eat it every day.  I have to say though, this isn't THE best Chinese food I've ever had, but it's freak'n pretty close.  And for the cost of this meal... $13.00!!!  Yup!\n\nOne thing I must mention that I wasn't pleased with was the service.  Our server needs to step up her game.  \n\nBc this place is new, it's much nicer then it's sister restaurant.

  "text": "Sunday Jazz Brunch\nBBQ Shrimp\nBloody Mary\n\nBased on a recommendation by a local store owner, we squeezed Mr. B's Bistro into our NOLA foodie sojourn.  It wasn't difficult really, as yelper Chris T. says, because I called the afternoon before and getting into Sunday Brunch was eezy peezy.  Definitely nothing like getting into Commander's Palace...(yea, I'm a little bitter about being turned away for not having a lunch reservation and making the $14 cab ride over)\n\nThe band for Sunday brunch was great; they took requests and were talented for what we've thus seen.  And though the layout of Mr. B's makes it seem like there are 'no good seats in the house', the band travels around sections of the restaurant.  What a treat! \n\nNow, the food and the cocktail were delicious.  Then, why did I give them 3 stars???!!!  The BBQ shrimp sauce was a little too salty for me and the shrimp a little overdone (peel and eat shrimp).  My boyfriend was impressed with it and it was his choice dish, so I could understand his tasty review.  However, my other thought was, I can't believe this costs $22/$28(?)!  Likewise, my little Bloody Mary was $6...we had a Bloody Mary twice the size at Bourbon House later that day (maybe not as well made).  \n\nMind you, I realized that we lucked out this weekend on being present during Restaurant Week and I'm sure I got sucked into believing the lower prices exist everywhere in NOLA...\n\nBut, Mr. B's was not worth the $$$ to me.  The service was just fine and the food as well...Perhaps, I'm not a believer of Dickie Brennan establishments...",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I were at Indeblue this Wednesday, and I am happy to say that this neo Indian (I like to call it food with a contemporary classicist flair) restaurant did not disappoint and impressed our hungry stomachs. I was compelled to make an instant comparison with Tashan on several levels.\nWhat stood out immediately was the decor while we were being led into the restaurant...Indian motifs with a modern flair, again reminiscent of Tashan perhaps..but it certainly had its  unique appeal. The location of Indeblue in my mind will be key to its success. Tashan feels a tad far out for the likes of us that like to sip and hang around the Walnut/Chestnut to South St. types of locales.\nThe menu does not disappoint either- they have a great spread of appetizers, entrees, veggie options and naans. The cocktail list looked like a cheery collection of Inde-Bollywood style names and fun flavors. We got the Bollywood sparkler (?) and the Chai tea sangria. The chai tasted better than Bollywood sparkler (this tasted too bubbly/frizzy for me) - the sangria was light and had hints of chai and brandy- a great combo to get a pitcher of, though it didn't sound appetizing in its description.\nThe service was worthy of nothing. Well informed servers that were good with suggestions. Don't get me wrong.. I am perfectly capable of choosing my tikkas, naans and rasams but given that the menu had an obvious personal flair of the chefs cooking style, it always helps to see how keen the chef is on informing the staff on his/her offerings. \nTo start we had the long hots and the crispy veg. chilli- to me a rendition of the stuffed long green chillies and the Indo-Chinese Hakka noodles. The paneer mozzarella combo in the green chillies were perfect-creamy, the chillies added bite and the tangy tomato sauce rounded the flavour off. The veg chilli had zucchinis in it (which I found interesting) but was a good subtle complement to the bold/spicy sauce (more gravy than sauce). The veggies had not lost their crunch despite the sauce on the noodles. To those familiar with Indo-Chinese food-the addition of the 3 side sauces (vinegar w/ green chillies, green chilli sauce and soy) completed my experience of eating this glamorized version of hakka noodles. spot on!!\nFor the main course, we had a meat and a veg option. Both were superb in their portion sizes, taste, flavour. We ordered the stuffed squash (this came with saffron rice) and osso bucco pork vindaloo. \nThe meat dish came with bone in which was perfect, the meat was melt in your mouth worthy cooked. It was a great meat, potatoes and gravy dish that is typically comfort food for me.  The vindaloo gravy did not have the pungency of vinegar that I seek, but completed the dish just fine.  I can see how an overpowering amount of vinegar can turn customers away from this dish. The garlic naan was fresh, however I am not sure if it was made in a tandoor or sigri, and I could taste uncooked flour in some parts of the bread- I chose to overlook this. The stuffed squash in my girlfriend's words- it was creamy (perhaps slightly excessively so) but very tasty, very well cooked, could have had a hint bit more of spice but she enjoyed it overall. If this was a take on \"malai kofta\" it was certainly well executed.\nOverall, I would go back and recommend it to others. Chef Rakesh Ramola certainly had the right idea with opening IndeBlue here in Philly. The prices could be comparable to Tashan, the food is just as good as Tashan's Chef Shende and Chef Senat. Where it beats Tashan is the location and the restaurant size. The location is always popping (regardless of weather or economic paucity), the place's size will make certain that it looks full even on days where only a few occupy the bar and tables- a definite draw for guests to peer in.",

  "text": "They forgot that they are in the service industry.  I stayed there for a 3-day business retreat that was being held at the hotel.  The décor is nice and what you would expect from a hotel of this class but the service didn't come close to matching.  \n\nAs a result of weather delays, I arrived a day late and missed the 1st morning of meetings so when I finally got to check-in, I was in a rush.  While standing in line at the front desk, I checked in on the phone app.  This meant I only had to show my ID and receive my card keys.  While checking in,  there was a notice that housekeeping services would only be every 4th day.  While I don't really care about having my room cleaned, I'm no slob and I only slept there, I did want my bed made daily (not sheets changed, just made) and I meant to mention it to the clerk.  Unfortunately, by the time I got to the desk, I forgot and no one brought it up. \n\nLater that afternoon, after my meetings concluded and I had a chance to shower, I called down to the front desk to request that my bed be made.  I was told, in no uncertain terms that they would not accommodate my request because of the Pandemic (of course there is no evidence of transmission from soft surfaces like cloth or why would they ask us to wear face coverings?)\n\nThe next day, while in meetings, I found out that one of my colleagues was getting daily service so that afternoon I called to speak to a manager.  He told me that it was too late in the day to get it done but he would have it done the next day.  Since it was mid-afternoon, I replied that was unacceptable, I had asked for the service the day before and was lied to that it wasn't available and I expected it today, he refused stating housekeeping had already assigned the rooms for the day.  After getting off the phone I stepped out of my room and ran into a housekeeper.  I asked her, she checked with her boss and amazingly, they were able to accommodate me.  \n\nNot only did the desk manager not even try to accommodate me, but he also failed to have the service set up for the following day.  This was an epic service failure that I would expect from a mom and pop.  I've received better service from Best Westerns.  I would never stay here by choice.",

She helped me decide which oysters to go with. I don't like mine too fishy or too big, so I'm glad the ones she recommended were small and delicious.\n\nOnce you place your order there is a bit of a wait to get tour food. This isn't a bad thing because you know your food is fresh and the oysters come directly out of the shell. However, they are a bit pricey I feel and I don't think the quality is worth the price. \n\nOverall, if you want something small and on a date night at sparkman wharf I say why not?",

  "text": "My first experience here was just grabbing a slice of pepperoni during Mardi Gras.  It was so good that I just couldn't wait to go back there.  When I finally did they gave me a free order of garlic knots just to try out with my slice of pepperoni pizza.  Since then Epic has been a staple on my list of go to-pizza places.  Their pizza really is that good.  The garlic knots themselves are delectable and my wife fell in love with them.   They're also directly next door to I-tap, probably the best draft beer bar in St. Louis.  \n\nThat said...the service at Epic has dropped with each subsequent service.  We've always explained that we were planning to eat at I-tap and this initially was not a problem.  They would always bring it right over to us.  Now we've been dealing with an older male, not sure of his name, who is very gruff and short.  He seems annoyed just by your presence in the establishment, especially once you mention I-tap.  However usually a woman, in glasses, brings over our garlic knots, which we get out first.  Then she also delivers our pizza to us.  By contrast she is very friendly and polite.  \n\nWith all that said...my wife and I decided to hit up I-tap and Epic this past Sunday evening.  There was a younger, short haired blonde girl working at the time we walked in.  We thought we were in for a refresher from the usual grumpy service we'd received of late from Epic.  We received almost exactly the opposite.  We explained at first that we would be eating it at I-Tap and asked to get our garlic knots out first.  She stated to us \"that they go in at the same time so I'm not sure they will make it out beforehand.\"  This has never been a problem in the past and we've always gotten them out at least 5-10 minutes before our pizza.  We went along with it though, thinking things may not be different than in the past.\n\nWell things were very different.  She brought over our large pepperoni pizza and the garlic knots, and smugly stated \"that the pizza wound up coming out first anyways.\"  Which I find impossible that a pizza can cook faster than it takes to throw the garlic bites into a fryer.  The garlic knots have absolutely zero garlic butter on them at all.  We are talking bone dry.  So my wife had to get up to go over there and ask for a side of the garlic butter.  \n\nI could maybe understand any of this if Epic was busy.  However there was one other family in the restaurant that already had their food, so it's not like they were getting bogged down with orders.  \n\nLet me state that I get that it must be frustrating to have a place like I-tap next door so nobody purchases their beer.  Let's look at the facts though..they aren't even offering any good beer!  They offer up the crappy Inbev special of Bud selections!  Why should I even entertain the idea of drinking that beer?  \n\nSecondly...my wife and I tip at least a full 20% share every time.  Not that this means you have to give me great service, but at least be courteous as I'm giving this to you before you even have provided any service to me as the customer.  If they really wanted to they honestly could ask us to come pick up the pizza in x-amount of minutes and we would be glad to do so.  I don't think they should expect the same tip for this service, but if they are truly annoyed to be doing business as they currently do...they could switch to this model. \n\nI honestly do love Epic's pizza, but this sort of service may have done it in for me.",

  "text": "This place was goood. I was in Nashville for a friend's bachelorette. Since planning meals for six girls and a gay guy in a new city across the country is a hit or miss situation, I took to Yelp and open table, chose places, and crossed my fingers and toes. I did good and got bridesmaid points by choosing The Old School. We talked about the damn meal for the rest of the trip. Some of us probably dreamed about it. I know I did.\n\nWe went for brunch and everyone was very impressed. That says a lot since we have a variety of nice brunch options at home. We ordered so much we could barely move. Everything was amazing. The best way to put it is this: you've never had eggs and bacon in your life until you've had freshly harvested and slaughtered eggs and bacon. The food is just different. The ingredients are all fresh from their farm and the texture is amazing. The donuts are fluffy pieces of heaven to die for. It's ok to have beer with breakfast because they make beermosas. Vacation carbs don't count. Order the pastry board.\n\nIt randomly snowed that morning so we couldn't see the animals that are fated to go into the menu. The outside atmosphere is so cute. The building is so rustic, the grounds are very pretty and quaint, with old schoolhouse picnic benches surrounded by gardens from which the vegetables and herbs are harvested from. Just with that experience alone, you immediately forget that you ate Wilbur's delicious cousin. Probably won't be back soon, but I definitely recommend this place to anyone in Nashville.",

So I decided to take my parents there this morning for breakfast since they are in from out of town for the holidays. We were seated within seconds of coming in. The hostess was friendly and took us to our seats. We were greeted with in seconds after sitting down by our waitress (Mandy). She was very kind, bubbly, and a absolute pleasure. Probably one of the best waitresses I have ever had. She asked us if we had ever been here before and when we said \"no\", she told us a bit about the place, drinks and the menu. We ordered the hazelnut coffee which was awesome. She brought us water to go along with it (we didn't even have to ask, it was like she knew). She was very familiar with the menu and answered any and all questions. I had the featured item of the month the banana bread french toast with eggs and bacon. It was absolutely heaven in my mouth. My mom had the crab cake Benedict and ranch potatoes which was also great and my dad had the GIANT blueberry pancake with eggs and turkey sausage, yum yum! Our food was hot, tasty, and very fresh and good. I know I will definitely be back and my parents too everytime they come to visit. I would give this place a 9 out of 10. The service was great, food was awesome, the restaurant itself was very nicely decorated and felt warm and inviting. The only down fall was the parking lot. It seemed a bit small for the volume of traffic coming in and out, but I know that's not their fault. We will definitely be back!!! Very happy customers!",

As soon as we sat down we were greeted by the bartender, Cerbi. As a bartender and server she was perfect. Attentive but not overbearing. She would chat with us when we wanted and leave us alone when we didn't. Professionally one of the best fine dining bartenders I've encountered. We started with some delicious pints of local ale, Barrio Blonde. Then we asked our bartender for some app suggestions. Within 15 maybe 20 minutes we had our appetizers. THE BEST PORK BELLY EVER! You must order this dish! When our apps arrived we order our entrees and got those about 20 minutes after finishing app completion.  We tried the house special pork saltimbocca and the alaskan halibut. Both were very nice! I was craving scallops all night but my friend wasn't into scallops so I'll have to come back by myself for those as they looked amazing! Finally we finished with the cannoli dessert! This was incredible! I don't even like desserts but this was devine! I dunked them all up in my Irish coffee! So good! Can't wait to come back! You need to \"treat yo self\" and have dinner here.

The atmosphere is very quiet, romantic, and intimate. It's pretty dark in there, but we didn't mind. Everyone enjoyed their food and drinks. My mom and I took part in the devour downtown menue which was an excellent deal, 3 courses for $30 bucks. My mom had filet and I had the seafood fetuccine which was really good but I did pick out the scallops. I've tried scallops at many different restaurants and just can't get over the texture so this isn't to speak to the quality of the scallops at this restaurant. My mom let me have some of her filet and it was incredible, tender, melt in your mouth steak. Fantastic new england clam chowder which is a soup I don't even like and won't eat unless I'm at 14 west. This is without a doubt my favorite local place. I've never had a bad meal. This was the first time I didn't order the lobster mac and cheese, but for the record, that dish is incredible and an appetizer which I usually order as my entree. Yes, it is pricey, but check out restaurant.com for gift certificates on the cheap. Also, I noted on my open table reservation that it was my mom's birthday and both the hostess and waiter wished her a happy birthday. It's nice touches like that that really show the true class of a restaurant and that they really care about their patrons. Park at mall parking right next door, it should only cost 1.50 for up to three hours.",

I asked for hot sauce for my soup. I'm addicted to spice. Kalamata make their own. It was so very good. If ever in green Hills area give this restaurant a try. You will savior the taste all day.",

You would think that an establishment right next to a major University would know the apartments and townhomes on campus for delivery purposes.  \n\nThe delivery guy was not only completely unprofessional both on the phone and in person, he refused to drive around and find my townhouse, and 'required' me to meet him in person on campus--I walked nearly as far to meet him that I could have almost made it to the damned restaurant in the first place.  To top it off, he demanded a tip and was angry when he believed I didn't tip him enough.\n\nNever. Again.\n\nI'd give it zero stars, but have to give one...prices are cheap(ish) at least.",

Mind you, we still ordered and devoured the tiramisu and cheesecake.\n\nYou can tell that a lot of thoughtfulness went into the planning of this tapas style menu and kudos to the chef who created these recipes! As an added bonus, Johnny Weir was in town and enjoying himself and seeing his beautiful coifed hairdo while hearing laughter and convo bouncing off the ceilings, made for a delightful and entertaining evening. \n\nMake sure to make reservations!

  "text": "I had heard great things about Good Dog, and after seeing the triple D episode, I was really excited about trying it out. A group of friends and I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, when the place was pretty empty (one or two other tables aside from ours). I loved the dog pictures on the wall!\n\nWe were seated directly under the air conditioner and were freezing, so we very politely asked the waitress if it was possible to turn it down. She glared at us and said, \"That's the bartender's job, not mine.\" My friend then asked, \"Oh, would you mind asking him to turn it down then?\" She got really sassy and said, \"Well, first of all, the bartender is a SHE. And fine\" before she stomped off. I am all about gender equality and not making assumptions, but there is no reason to be so nasty about an innocent (and frankly, grammatically correct) error. I work in a hospital and am mistakenly called a nurse all the time, but I don't go around berating everyone for it. Maybe this waitress was having a bad day? But seriously, if you're at work, then act like it. \n\nOur food also took almost 45 minutes to come out (we were still shivering this whole time, by the way, because whatever the bartender did to turn down the AC did not work), and when it did, it wasn't mind-blowing. Maybe I had expectations that were too high, but our burgers and po boys were good but not amazing. The aioli for the fries was also pretty bland, though the fries themselves were pretty decent. \n\nThen I had to use the restroom at one point, and I got up to ask the waitress if it was in the back. She just stared at me like I was dumb and said, \"Mhm.\" \n\nHonestly, I'm really disappointed. I was hoping to find a place I could keep coming back to for a good burger and a fun atmosphere. Even though Good Dog does have character, my experience there was pretty awful. I don't think anyone should have to put up with a hostile waitress for decent food - there are plenty of amazing restaurants in Philly that have a nice staff and delicious food for a reasonable price.",

Nearly every single seat at the bar was taken by a man with a logo on his shirt and a wedding ring on his finger..  \ni'm guessing these were truck drivers away from home, eating at the bar, alone...\n\nWe were in the mood for steak and were trying to decide where to go.  Son was feeling thrifty and went through the different restaurants locally, for steak..  He settled on this restaurant because i told him i had eaten here before and the meat was good.\n\nGot to the bar at 7:15. Didn't get dinner until about 7:40-7:45..\nGot out at 9pm.\nThe wait time for food was long. \nWedge salad came out and the lettuce was dead.. it had been dead for a couple of days, I'm guessing.\nI ordered my steak MR. It came out seared on the outside and raw on the inside.  The grilled asparagus were cooked perfectly.  I wasn't charged for the extra bleu cheese dressing I requested for the dead lettuce.\nFriend ordered rib eye with mac & cheese and a side of grilled shrimp and rice.  He didn't say anything bad about his dinner except that his mac & cheese was off.\nWhen I tasted it, I gathered that they cooked up the pasta and threw some canned cheese sauce on it and called it a day...... terrible.\nI got the little tiny bucket of dessert.. Brownie with a tablespoon of vanilla ice cream on top.\nIt was delicious...  so the asparagus and the brownie was delicious.  \nThe steak?  I brought it home. I'm going to cook it up with eggs, in the morning.\nThey offered to recook it for me, but it took so long to get dinner and dessert, I couldn't bare to think I would have to sit there another 20 minutes for my steak to cook more..\nSo with that.. I have tried this restaurant two times.\nThat's good enough for me.\nI don't recommend it.",

When we went inside to check the wait time, the hostess took my name and asked for my phone number, I was expecting a phone call when our table was ready, but they actually sent text messages with a link to an app that allows you to see where your place in line is which we thought was pretty cool.\nThe inside is really nice and clean. We were seated at a round table next to a fireplace with a huge skylight right over our table.\nWe decided to share an order of the OMG french toast as an appetizer. It came with three pieces of dipped whole wheat french toast topped with dollops of pumpkin cinnamon mascarpone, toasted pecans, caramel drizzle, and bacon. To be completely honest, I did not think that this french toast sounded appetizing at all - but I could not have been more wrong about it! The mascarpone was such a great flavor on the french toast, and the bacon added an unexpected smokiness to it.\nI ordered the bandito burrito (tortilla with three scrambled eggs, onions, peppers, chorizo - it comes covered in cheese with a small cup with sour cream, and I opted for no salsa. It comes with a side of home fries and fruit). I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito, it was HUGE - I didn't think there was anything \"special\" about it per se, but it was done really well and I would be happy to order it again.\nMy husband ordered the big easy benedict (corn bread topped with avocado, creole seasoned onions, peppers, and chorizo, with poached eggs, and a cajun hollandaise. Maybe the reason I feel the way I do about the burrito I ordered is because I tried the big easy benedict - truly the best eggs benedict I have ever had. It is packed with flavor, and the corn bread pairs so perfectly with the flavor profile.\nOur friends ordered the wilbur skillet (bacon, potatoes, avocado, diced tomatoes, cheese, and eggs your way), grande huevos rancheros (diced potatoes, chipotle peppers, chorizo, onions, black beans, cilantro, avocado, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and eggs your way), and the tuscany omelette (roasted red peppers, spinach, sausage, and mozzarella).\nI didn't try their orders, but they all seemed to enjoy everything.\nThe reason I didn't give The Turning Point five stars was for a few reasons - we were told our wait would be around 45 minutes and it was over an hour and 3 of the five egg orders were incorrect. They had switched the egg orders on the huevos rancheros and the wilbur skillet (which we didn't realize until later that day), and my husband's poached eggs were very overcooked - they were basically hard boiled without the shell. \nThose things aside we will definitely be returning and I can't wait to try the corn bread french toast and their specialty hot chocolates!",

  "text": "Had to stay here for a work conference, figuring it would be sensational.... Was I ever surprised!  Checked in to what appeared to be a beautiful lobby.  Had to walk quite a distance to the elevator to take me to the 3rd floor.  They did offer assistance with the trek.  However, when I got to my room, I was taken back by the odor when I 1st entered.  It was very musty, moldy smelling, but I didn't see anything obvious....at first.  I unpacked, noted the smell never improved.  Kicked off my shoes and went to steam my clothes for the morning.  Unfortunately, before I ever made it to the bathroom, my feet were wet.  The carpet was very wet, below the thermostat.  There was no a/c vent or duct work above it, but there was an obvious darker area to the carpet.  At that point, I noted the room temp was set at 68 degrees, and it didn't appear that I could change it.  Even with the cool temp, I seemed to have been in a sauna... So sweaty!  The humidity in the room must have been at 90-95%.  So I checked out other things, and found a pot of artificial flowers on the desk....supposedly white, but covered with mold spots.  I didn't call or go to the office to find a different room.  After speaking with other coworkers, their rooms had the same smell.  Fortunately for them, they were missing the wet carpet.  Let's just say, my sleep time, felt more like a frigid sauna, if there could be such a thing.  You want to experience this... Stay in room 335.",

  "text": "What a great place to have brunch!\n\nWe hit this place up with friends on the Saturday before Easter. Even though it was busy, there was ample space to sit and dine in peace. I didn't feel like I was rubbing elbows with strangers, like I often do at restaurants. \n\nOn top of that, I was so pleased with the inventive and delicious mimosas! Strawberry and pepper! Grapefruit and winter spices! Flavorful balanced twists on a classic drink. We sampled them all, and you should too.\n\nFor food, we mostly stuck to the taco menu, though my husband departed and got the johnny cakes and fried chicken (which he enjoyed). Here's where the restaurant fell down a little bit. The tacos were composed almost exclusively of meat. Each taco had a generous serving of delicious meat, but only a sparse serving of other toppings, be it a single wedge of avocado, or a lone thin slice of jalapeno. I get it - it's BUTCHERtown Hall. It's about the meat. But even the bell of the ball needs a date to the dance. Of course the meat was delicious, but all of the tacos could have been enhanced by more toppings.\n\nThere were also problems with plating practices. If three people at the table order lamb tacos, a single plate of three lamb tacos comes to the table. Since everyone had ordered a smorgasbord of different tacos, keeping tabs on who got what taco was difficult, both for us and for our waitress. Three of our tacos didn't come out and we had to inquire about them. \n\nStill an overall enjoyable experience. Go to Butchertown Hall for an easy quiet brunch and order some incredible mimosas and meat centric dishes. Write down who had what.",

Sail Pavilion can be a great stop for anyone biking, running, or walking the Tampa Bay Riverwalk.  This place is dog friendly with plenty of dog water bowls available so bring your furry friends! However, the service is terribly slow. Drink prices are a bit pricey at $5-7 per beer and $8-12 per mixed drink. They have a wide variety of tropical drinks including: the blue crush, pina colada, strawberry daquiri, rum runner, coco loco, mud slide, margarita, sex on the beach, mai tai, and mojito. I had the burger and shrimp wontons and they were both awful. They only have 1 waiter and 2 bartenders for the whole place.  I got tired of waiting and went up to the bar and that took over 10 minutes in a 4 deep line just to get a drink.  They need a better menu and more staff on the weekends. Especially if there is an event at the Convention Center. Sail Pavilion has food trucks almost every Friday and is a local crowd favorite gathering spot for residents of Downtown and Habour Island. Boaters can dock their boat at the marina in front of the restaurant, take a boat tour from the marina, rent water bikes, rent boats, and soak in pretty views of the boats in the marina, Jackson's Waterfront Bistro, Harbour Island, Davis Island, the Hillsborough River, and even Bayshore!",

I had the buffalo chicken wrap with fries and a mango margarita.\n\nThe Buffalo Chicken Wrap had Crispy Chicken, Buffalo Sauce, Celery, and ranch dressing (I swapped that for the Bleu Cheese Dressing that it typically comes with) Tomatoes, and Lettuce.  The buffalo sauce was a bit overpowering for my taste. The next time I'll probably just ask for that on the side. I also got the natural cut fries with it and they were bland. They were hot and crisp, but didn't really have a flavor profile. \n\nThe margarita was good. I would get that again. It was a nice balance of alcohol and sweetness.\n\nThings to know:\n1. This location is in the mall so you will most likely park underground and have to pay a small fee for parking (unless you happen to snag one of the few street level parking spots).\n2. Remember your elevator or escalator so you don't lose your car.",

We ordered the wings extra crispy since the crew I was with were wing experts  and our experience has taught us to be careful with undercooked wings.  Of course we've never had that problem here and the cook made them to perfection.  Between the three of us we devoured the entire plate.  I ordered a dinner salad which was much larger than I thought, so I wound up wasting it.  Overall it was a very good experience in the food was good as expected.  I would greatly recommend that you",

This could easily be a 10 stars place.\n\nTried it today for the first time, we got the Gamberi di Buffalo (shrimp in hot sauce with blue cheese and celery) as an appetizer. The shrimps were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of breading, nice and spicy but without disabling your taste buds for hours. A wonderful appetizer.\n\nAs the main entree we opted for the 3 Cheese Pizza (they use REAL gorgonzola cheese and not some crumbled concoction of blue cheese and God knows what else like most other places do, if they even offer something in the likes). The pizza was excellent, ultra thin like a real pizza is supposed to be (very italian style), nicely cooked with a nice crisp crust and a blackened out bottom (it's not burned, just the way a pizza is meant to be if cooked at the right temperature). No overpowering flavors, the cheeses perfectly blend in with each other making it one of the most mouth watering pie in the area.\n\nNeedless to say the whole pie (large) was consumed at the table, no leftovers for my dinner with this one, and trust me....it is difficult not to finish their Pizza. \n\nDelicate yet bold in flavor, and does not leave you with that bloated feeling after consuming it.\n\nOveral was a wonderful experience, my taste buds are still dancing with joy. \n\nDefinitely a keeper and won't be long before we go back for another pizza and to try some of the other entree they provide on their well assorted menu.\n\nStaff was friendly, service was fast and spot on.\n\nOh did I mention their bread? A new take on the usually boring garlic knots offered by pizza parlors. And a successful take shall I say, nicely flavored, soft and moist to the point I could just go there and eat that for lunch and be satisfied.\n\nGreat little gem of a place.",

My wife had the PEI mussels in a delicate wine broth with ample sour dough bread to savor the juice. The portions were filling, so we skipped dessert! There were plenty of other things on the menu to like. Someone else had the mushroom polenta, which she enjoyed. I'm keeping it on the list for the next time were downtown.",

I'm not sure if the server mixed them up when entering the order, or if it was the fault of the kitchen, but it doesn't really matter since neither of us got the temperature we ordered. \n\nI ordered the Who Dat Burger and I was left wondering what BBQ sauce they use. It must be incredibly expensive since there was such a minuscule amount of it on my burger.

  "text": "If I were eating my last meal on Earth, raw oysters would definitely be one of the appetizers.  When my wife finally nagged me to make the 5 1/2 hour drive to New Orleans, Drago's immediately became a must stop during our culinary eating weekend.  My wife and I are BIG fans of the raw oysters but we had to stop at Drago's to try their much beloved chargrilled oysters.  We arrived at this location at 7 p.m. on Friday night and were quickly seated without any wait. As we walked by the open kitchen, where we saw the oysters getting shucked and grilled, our mouths began to water like a rabid canine.  \n\nWe ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters and a dozen of the raw oysters. I also ordered the grilled drum (similar to redfish) but the oysters were the reason we came.  The raw and chargrilled oysters arrived and we quickly noticed these oysters must have been hormone fed because they were gigantic.  The chargrilled oysters are as good as other reviewers say they are and lived up to our expectations.  \n\nHOWEVER, we still loved the raw oysters more. That's because when you cook an oyster, you basically kill the natural flavors and they become whatever ingredient you put on them. In this case, they tasted like garlic, butter and wood fired smoke.  The sweet/salty brine and plumpness were gone from the chargrilled oysters. To us, it's like taking a piece of toro and chargrilling it.  Some things are meant to be eaten raw.  Thankfully, we were also able to enjoy the fantastic raw oysters.\n\nAs a footnote, the grilled drum was very good and would be a formidable star, if not for the brighter oyster star in this universe.",

  "text": "The boyfriend had a hankering for prime rib and neither of us wanted to travel far or pay the big bucks. Believe it or not, Outback is his favorite go-to for a reliable prime rib... and while that was just across the street we decided to try out Charlie Brown's since we had yet to do so since moving to the area.\n\nI will start off by saying the decor is nice and cozy and our waiter was attentive but that's where the positives end.\n\nThe food was a complete miss.\n\nWe started with the happy hour nachos appetizer. It should be noted that not only was the appetizer half price, but it was HALF THE PORTION. Err... nice try, guys. Anyway... it was pretty gross. Chili from a can, tasteless cheese and guacamole that was almost soupy. It was also served on a plate that was far too small for the portion so we ended up with nachos everywhere.\n\nI figured the salad bar was a safe bet but I quickly discovered I was mistaken. While the options were vast, the lettuce was old and very, very watery to the point I had to grab a napkin and pat it dry before I built my salad. I skipped over the mayonnaise-based salads as they aren't really my bag. I liked that they had a few bread options but unfortunately they weren't very fresh.\n\nMy boyfriend, as he intended, ordered the prime rib and was appalled. He's sort of a prime rib aficionado and thought it was a crime they charge as much as they do for such low quality meat. It's the extreme rare occasion I see him not enjoy prime rib (or any hunk of beef, for that matter) so that pretty much sealed the deal that we won't be returning to Charlie Brown's.",

  "text": "Not going to lie, I was a little hesitant about going here. But man am I glad I did! Their happy hour is a hidden treasure. From what I saw it goes from 3-7 &10-12 and it's 1/2 off drafts and long neck bottles. We got there around 10 on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating. We were served right away and the waitress was so friendly. First, I was shocked by how many beers they actually offer. They had about 5 different IPAs just on tap. Then, I was even more shocked by the prices! Since it was happy hour, our beers were only $2.50! I haven't been able to get a nice IPA in Nashville for less than $6. After several beers we got a little hungry and checked out the late night food menu. It was impressive. Reasonably priced bar food at its finest. I ordered the Queso chips and was not disappointed. Homemade queso, sour cream, and salsa. I mean, it was nothing fancy but for a dive bar it was pretty delicious. Overall, our tab had 5 beers and Queso chips...the total was about $19. I mean, come on! You can't find a better deal than that in Nashville. Sure, it's a dive bar in a quieter area, but hey, if you're in the area and looking to for cheap drinks, Jonny's is the place to go. Be warned, people are allowed to smoke inside so it does get to be a little much.",

  "text": "The sub zero vodka bar is by far my favorite bar in the city. Their selection of vodka is incomparable with over 500 brands in house. Their drinks are usually kick ass, with some being very strong, but they're all worth a try. I usually try to drink something new every time I'm there due to the impossible number of drink combinations and I'm never let down. I would highly recommend the vodka bar, and even if vodka isn't your forte, the same people also own the Gamlin Whiskey house down the block and if has an extensive drink list as well.",

  "text": "OMG, you must try this place! I dropped in for lunch not frequenting Clayton often so I didn't realize the restaurant is brand new. They were very busy at 11:30, but worked the crowd like pros. The food was refreshingly tasteful and quite filling for lunch. I tried the Koran corn with cheese and breaded mushroom bao sandwich. Both will be ordered again! The Bao buns are freshly made-reminds me of a large kolache bun. When you walk in, you write down your order, pay then sit. The bartender gave me a tip that if you plan to sit at the bar you can order and pay him to 'skip the line'. All the employees were extremely friendly. A manager checked on me twice and the owner stopped by to say hello as well. My entire dining experience, just a 'quick lunch break', was absolutely fantastic! I chatted with the bartenders a bit about their drink menu and am looking forward to scheduling a happy hour event at this lovely venue. The restaurant has a small footprint with a modern yet cozy atmosphere. I've dined at most restaurants in Clayton-this one has made my favorites list! They serve breakfast and lunch so if you are going for lunch on a work break, I suggest going early. It's tasty and unique. I'm sure this place will be packed and become a popular lunch favorite as more people try it.",

  "text": "We decided to stop in one Sunday for brunch Don't expect to be seated immediately, we waited for about half an hour outside before we got a table. Seating is community-style, which was great as we are very friendly people and there were just two of us. \n\nI could see how this may not be good for groups due to the community seating. That being said, I loved that we got to make friends with the couple of ladies sitting next to us.\n\nWe ordered the bologna scone (no longer available), ancient grain porridge, and potato & celeriac latke. The scone was excellent and delightfully surprising with the bits of salty bologna. The porridge was very good and I would wait in line again just for that. The latke was unique and lighter than a traditional normal all potato latke, and the onion marmalade was tasty.\n\nThe vibe was relaxed and friendly, but service was relatively slow and pretty loud. The building it is in is very unique and has tall ceilings and that may have been what caused the higher volume. \n\nAll in all, this is my favorite $30 brunch in the city- a little pricey but a great place to eat and hang out, something that is not common at other brunch places.",

  "text": "Went there twice this weekend, so I've got a review for the bar on Friday night and for Sunday brunch with a few out of town guests.  \n\nFriday night at the bar: Weird vibe, but reasonable drink prices.\n\nSunday brunch: We took a quick cruise around Rittenhouse (we were staying at the Sofitel) and saw: Parc was too crowded, Rouge was too expensive and if I had mentioned Ruby Tuesdays or a breakfast buffet at Chez Colette, I probably would have gotten a smack upside the head by my friends.  I would have deserved it too.\n\nSquare 1682 seemed like a good choice - close proximity to hotel, empty enough so that we had ample time before we had to catch our trains, liquor license.\n\nThe Good:\n-Excellent bloody marys.  Spicy and with enough hair of the dog.  Much better than the ones we had the day earlier at Jones.\n-The free range braised short rib sandwich was delicious.  I had serious food envy because I only got a bite of it from a friend.\n\nThe OK:\n-The concept of making your own fritatta (pick cheese, herbs, veggies and meat) could be fun, but seemed daunting when hung over.  The fritatta tasted fine, but I was expecting to look like Morning Glory -- puffy, golden and enormous.  This was like a flatter, slightly undercooked version.\n\nThe not so great:\nService - friendly, but it took forever to get water refilled and it was tough to get someone to stop so we could ask for ketchup (I know, but come on, if you're serving home fries, expect to be asked for ketchup).\n-The grilled chicken sandwich.  To quote my friend, \"Why is it so black?  And why is it so small?\"  The chicken was way overdone, dry and the basil aioli or pesto whatever they put on it proved to be just some very bright green coloring that didn't help make the sandwich any less dry.  Also, the housemade chips on the side were good but so oversalted that you could really only eat a few.\n\nIt was $25 each for an entree and a bloody mary, with tax and tip.  All in all, it's exactly what I could have gotten at any hotel restaurant in nearly any somewhat metropolitan city.  Eh.\n\nIt's not Square 1682's fault, but why is it so easy to find awesome brunch with a free bloody mary or mimosa for under $20 in NYC and nearly impossible here?",

There are plenty of wine flights to choose from, & wines by the glass/bottle.  The service was great as well!  My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) was that the red wines I ordered seemed to be served too cold!  They were almost as cold as whites should be served, which took away from the flavors of the wines!",

Overall I was very pleased with the food (obviously most important), the service, the value (my meal was $16 w/o tip), and ambience. I will definitely be back!",

Their lunch menu is HUGE and CHEAP!  Service was fast, even with the bar being busy. The bread and olive oil is always warm and fresh. We both had different soups. Lobster bisque was flavorful, although not necessarily the best I've had. Husband loved the steak chili. He had a side salad and we shared two sides - deviled eggs and sweet potato fries. Everything tasted great. We've eaten here many times - dinner is great, but the lunch value is what keeps bringing us back!",

  "text": "Saw the sign for Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop on our way to our hotel. When our room wasn't ready, I asked for a recommendation - the response to which was a trendy spot in the French Quarter (a little pricier and too far for my taste). So I consulted my \"Around Me\" app to see what restaurants were in the vicinity. Chef Ron's popped up with Yelp reviews of 4.5 stars. 4.5 stars plus gumbo plus amazing reviews. This was a no brainer.\n\nParking is very tight, but there is some parking on an adjacent street. The restaurant is very divey - all atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful. They serve local beers in addition to your standard national brands, and they have a nice wine selection - much more than you'd expect from a place that seats no more than 30.\n\nThe food.... oh my goodness.... the food was phenomenal. If you go to Louisiana for the food, Chef Ron's is the place to go. We started with a couple of appetizers: Boudin Balls and BBQ Shrimp Quesadillas. The Boudin Balls were the best I've had in Louisiana: deep fried pork and rice balls, served with a spicy mayo. The grilled shrimp quesadillas featured shrimp perfectly seasoned with beer and spices atop melted cheese in a grilled tortilla. Our main course featured - of course - gumbo. I had the Mumbo Gumbo, a creole treat of crawfish, shrimp, crabmeat, okra, tomato, chicken and sausage with rice in a spicy broth. My husband had the Yumbo Mumbo Gumbo, which was the same gumbo topped with fried shrimp. Both dishes were out of this world and the best we've eaten in these parts.\n\nI rarely give 5 stars, but Chef Ron's was the complete package: location, atmosphere and food! If you head to New Orleans and want some authentic local cuisine, head to Metairie to Chef Ron's. It's right off of the Rt. 10 Causeway and is definitely worth the trip. By the way, I'll be advising the front desk of our hotel to start recommending them!",

We have visited them twice in their opening week. The first time we went for dinner. We ordered the Award Winning Pork Roll Burger which comes with a fried egg, cooper american cheese, and siracha mayo on a potato roll. Jason took his first bite, and when I asked if I could try it he immediately told me \"No!\" and blocked his plate off. (he did let me get a bite in though) The flavors just explode in your mouth. I ordered the taco special they were having. That came with slow roasted pork tacos with red cabbage, siracha mayo, fresh slices of mango on top and finished with cilantro. They were delicious and the pork was extremely tender. The last thing we ordered was the Blue Duck Fries. If you aren't a duck lover already, these will certainly turn you into one. They start with fresh cut potatoes that they slice in the back. Drop them in the oil and when they are finished and crispy the toss them in duck fat. Cover with Smoked Gouda  Cheese sauce and shredded duck. I also suggest you sitting at the counter to eat. It is like dinner and a show while you sit. The kitchen staff is entertaining and you can tell that they are concerned about your meal as you are eating it. They want to make sure that you are having the time of your life there, and you can tell they are. They invite you to join into their showcase. This place is by far one of the best places to eat in NE Philly. If you weren't there for their opening week, you missed out BIG TIME. \n\nWe went for Brunch on Sunday morning which is from 10-4. We both ordered Chicken and Waffles. The Belgian waffles were fluffy and crispy. The chicken was moist and crispy. The smoked paprika give it such a different flavor that you don't want to stop eating.",

  "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but there were just too many negatives for me to feel it was worth it. I went in on a Thursday night with a very forgiving attitude (I know the place is new) but I kept hitting roadblocks during our meal. \n\n++++++++++Service+++++++++++++\n\nService-wise, my partner and I entered what seemed to be a dead restaurant, the lights were way too dim and the lone bartender and waitress were waiting on no one. I chalked it up to being early-ish (around 6) on a weekday night. The entire time we were there only one other couple came in and they only ordered appetizers and drinks. Despite being pretty lonely everything still took way too long. This was not the biggest problem. \n\nWe sat ourselves and as we looked at the menus the waitress warned us that not everything on the menu was available. So we looked it over while we waited for her to check in. It took a while before she returned to inform us that all items were, in fact, available. So we ordered, and she informed me that the burger that I ordered (the Frenchie- a mushroom burger that I'll get to later), came with hamburger meat. I was very okay with this situation. When the food came out she informed me that the Frenchie no longer included meat. Had she come out to tell me this beforehand I might have ordered something else, instead I had to choose between seeing if I could send my burger back, or just grinning and bearing it. I took the burger as it was. \n\nWhen we finally finished and paid we had to wait for the bartender to take our tab. The place was so dead that the waitress and someone else (maybe the owner? or a cook?) were taking their dinner above the bar. Overall a pretty negative experience.\nThe one final mixed bag in our experience was the payment situation. Craft's credit card system failed early in the night and we had to use the ATM across the street to withdraw cash and pay. Even though that wasn't a great situation (and not their fault) they did offer to pay for the withdrawal fee, which was nice. \n\n+++++Food++++++++++++\n\nIn terms of food, it feels like Craft is trying to be memorable rather than making quality food. The menu features a variety of cheeses and quality meats, from pancetta in the wedge salad to fried brie as a starter, but I can't help but think that they should focus less on drawing in people with fancy ingredients, and more on getting them to stay with actual tasty food. \n\nWe ordered 2 burgers, the Frenchie (beer battered fried portabello, brie, caramelized onion, au jus) and the Main Burger (dry aged beef, smoked gouda, and smoked bacon) as well as the Poutine as a starter. \n\nThe Poutine ($9) had great cheese curds but their great taste was drowned out by a weird taste in the Guinness gravy, and pretty mediocre fries. This  recipe definitely feels like it needs to be reworked. \n\nThe Frenchie ($12) had the aforementioned ordering issues but otherwise was pretty underwhelming. I enjoy just mushroom burgers and I have had great breaded mushroom and cheese burgers. This, however, lacked good breading, was very watery (at one point my bun was very unappetizing and mush-like), and the entire burger lacked any flavor. The Brie and caramelized onions added very little flavor and I just wanted to salt everything. \n\nThe Main Burger ($11) was better, but not by much. It had just four ingredients, cheese, meat, bacon, and bread, yet it still missed the mark. The meat was cooked way past medium despite our request, and it made the meat dry. The cheese was completely unmelted and added virtually nothing to the taste, we tried the cheese on its own and it was quite good, but it was drowned out by the dryness of the burger. In addition to this, the fries that came with both burgers were inconsistently salted, every fry was either bland or oversalted and they tasted like they were made of two batches, one new, one old. \n\nOverall nothing we ordered was worth the price we paid and unless they improve their quality of food I wouldn't recommend or return to Craft Manayunk.",

  "text": "We went to Reno for a weekend getaway from Las Vegas to see a little snow. My fellow wanted to go to this spot so we headed over around 5:00 on Friday. We were told by the hostesses that we could sit anywhere at the bar but we would need to go through them if we wanted to sit at a table. There weren't two seats together at the bar, so we went back to the hostess station to grab a table, as empty tables were plentiful. The hostesses immediately asked if we were going to eat. We shrugged and said we wanted to have a few beers....not sure about food (hadn't even looked at a menu) and were told that tables were only available to people who were eating. Are you kidding me? I have worked in restaurants for years. You have an empty house and you just turned away paying customers? This establishment obviously has a management problem. We went down the street, ran up a bar tab over $100 and tipped our server well. I wouldn't go back there for anything. There is a reason this place is in Reno and not Las Vegas. That nonsense would never fly here.",

I consider the thin crust to be one step up from a Tostinos if not identical. Also so far I've had pretty aloof and rude wait staff including this obnoxious bartender who, while waiting for my pizza to be finished for take out, insulted me multiple times with very off and rude comments. I'm actually pretty ashamed that this place is my neighborhood pizza joint. Hopefully they work on these issues so I can be a regular for them!",

We had gone to a Farmers Market Moonlight Event right next door to this place a few weeks ago and it made us take notice. I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes from the premium cupcake selection. These cupcakes were  most delicious tasting and beautifully prepared. The cake portion of the cupcake was extremely delicate and tasty, no tunneling from over mixing, just right! Just got comparison sake, I bought a few cupcakes from Rouses bakery case and there was no comparison. The premium cupcakes are $4 a piece so they aren't cheap, but worth every bit and penny!",

The donut alone, even without toppings, is delicious. It's a cake donut that is perfectly warm, soft, and sweet, but not overbearing. I don't have the worlds biggest sweet tooth so I consistently get the cinnamon sugar donut which is heaven on earth. But they have tons of toppings and recommended suggestions too. \n\nIf a donut is as much of an occasional treat for you as it is for me, you might as well make it worth it. Duck Donuts is that place for me.",

  "text": "I've been frequenting the Good Egg on Speedway/Kolb for many years so, yes, I'm a fan. Out of dozens and dozens of meals that I've enjoyed, very few have undercut my expectations. The menu features an artisan variety of omelets, eggs Benedicts, pancakes and oatmeal. The chefs at the Good Egg have a great deal of imagination as well as expertise. For the health conscious, the caloric value of each meal is clearly displayed on the menu and there are plenty of heart healthy items available. I don't drink coffee, but I'm told friends who frequently accommodate me that it is excellent. I've also heard from more than one person that the bacon is the best in town. Seriously! My hiking buddy comes to the Good Egg with me just for the bacon! My personal favorites on the menu are the Sunrise Benedict with turkey ham, grilled tomato and avocado- and the Castroville omelet with artichoke hearts, tomato, mushrooms, onions and spinach. Many breakfast items come with a choice of seasoned home style potatoes or hash browns. Both are worth trying. If you get a pancake, you don't need to get a stack. One gourmet pancake will fill you up! You can order a pancake in whole wheat if you wish, or with real maple syrup. There are all kinds of combinations to choose from.  \n\nThe staff is quite capable and friendly and the service is professional and personable. If you visit often enough, you will get to know the wait staff and they will get to know you as well. If you have a favorite booth or chair, they will try to accommodate you. On weekends, due to the popularity of the Good Egg, there may be a short wait to get seated, but it is worth the wait. During warm weather, the patio is a great place to eat al fresco. \n\nThe Good Egg has the best breakfast on the east side and I've tried them all.",

  "text": "I have been coming here since they first opened. I had tried their cookies, breakfast pastry, lunch, and bread. Everything is delicious. The pastry is flaky, bread is amazing, and lunch is wonderful, if you can find a table. Unfortunately, their cakes are hit or miss. We bought some cupcakes once, and the kids wouldn't eat them b/c they were very hard. We got some again a few months later thinking it was a mistake, but again, the cupcakes were so hard which didn't justify how expensive they were. Then for 3 years in a row, we've purchase a birthday cake for my BD. The first cake was hard and the icing tasted oily. It wasn't very pleasant. My spouse bought me another cake the 2nd year and it was great. So this year we got one again, vanilla with butter cream. The cake was bread-y, it's more like the consistency of banana bread instead of light and fluffy, and the cream again tasted oily. I am very picky about my dessert, and I have to say a Wegman's cake tastes better than Alice. I still love Alice for everything else they have. Love the pastry, and esp. the lunch. Just that I wouldn't get cupcakes or cakes there again, that's why I took a star off.\n\nOh, if you go there for lunch, do take consideration that the wait staff also have to help out at the counter. So be patient and they'll definitely get to you. Every waiter/waitress we had always wear a smile, even when they are very busy. We've been there multiple times, esp. in the summer b/c you can find tables outside. Just enjoy a leisurely long lunch and the food is totally worth it!",

Bloody Mary was 1/2 way decent. My daughter didn't even touch her burger and wanted to take it home. Asked for a \"to go\" and she brings me 2 tiny containers. I laughed and said not even 1/4 of that will fit. She tells me to cut it up. So I said she didn't even touch it and you do t have a way for me to transport it home, so you can take it off the bill. No interest in giving it a 2nd chance. At least not this location.",

I'm not a beer drinker so I can only judge on the food - which was superb.\n\nHam and brie on a croissant could be a win, or a fail... here it is definitely win. Flaky fresh perfect croissant + thinly sliced ham + brie = delicious. Add sides of a small pile of nuts, a handful of fresh red grapes and an apple sliced and then drenched in honey? Oh, yes please.\n\nThe build out is excellent - heck, I remember when the joint was a dog grooming place and a junky furniture shop - huge step up from there. Side room has a small stage for music acts, and I'm told the happy hour can be SRO. Chatted with the bartender and food prep guys for a while - great neighborhood place.

  "text": "I'm thinking that this establishment should just stick to beer. I came here tonight with a friend after having high hopes and we were both so disappointed in the food! \n\nWe ordered the pretzel with beer cheese for an appetizer. The pretzel, while large, was extremely greasy and the beer cheese was SO mild - almost no flavor whatsoever.  The mustard that also accompanied the pretzel was overly salty, so neither dipping sauce was really that desirable.  I just opted for the flavorless beer cheese (better then a mouthful of salt, right?) Also, I'm not sure if it was the kitchen or server, but they forgot to bring it out first and gave it to us in the middle of our dinner.  Not a deal breaker, but it took a good 25 minutes for it to come out. \n\nFor dinner I got the WOB COB salad. It sounded great on the menu! When I received it, I immediately noticed there was barely any lettuce! My friend also noticed the same issue with her salad. (See photo.) I basically had a bowl with bacon, mozarella, eggs, chicken and a few salad leaves. I actually ended up asking for a side of lettuce for my salad and had to mix it in. Very weird! Also, as I was eating it, I kept picking out chunks of frozen peppers.  I'm wondering if it's pre-made in the back. \n\nWhile this place has a cute ambiance and a fun crowd, the food was really lackluster. I think I would come back for a drink with friends, but the food really disappointed me. Maybe there is a better dish on the menu, but I'm skeptical.",

Every venue we had visited made us feel like an \"appointment\" but Carol and Marc made us feel like we were at home. It was all the little things...The way they had a box of desserts as a gift for us (and their desserts are BOMB), or the way they dressed up the venue for a mock wedding for us that brought me to tears. This couple is really such an inspiration because they are doing what they love. Every step of the way they strive to make your event so special. It's because of this passion they have helped us make our wedding a reality. \n\nGuests could not stop talking about how great the food was and so many people told me they had 2-3 plates of food. All our desserts were gone at the end of the night! I love this catering company from the bottom of my heart!

  "text": "My Yelp friends Coty and Paul asked me to join them one evening at Mei's World Pizza and Salads along Bearss Avenue, near Bruce B Downs, in the USF area. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, as the name of this place seems to imply a pizza shop, and yet Coty told me that they serve very good Taiwanese food. Hmmmm, well, she has never failed me with her selection of restaurants, and so I was game to give this place a try.\n\nSure enough, this little restaurant on the north side of Bearss Avenue looks like a pizza / sandwich shop from the outside, but inside, the place was packed with college students in the know, as well as folks looking for good Thai food. \n\nThe first thing you should know is that nothing on the regular Thai menu is priced over $10. That includes rice bowls, noodle bowls and platters, traditional Thai appetizers, and a great mix of entrées. Secondly, they DO serve pizza......and apparently you can have them put Thai or Chinese / American food on top of your pizza. Finally, if you are so inclined, they do serve pig's feet, chicken feet, chicken lips, chicken butt, and a whole lot of things that will never go into my mouth. Sorry, but I just can't picture a chicken walking around on a pair of crutches because someone wanted to eat chicken feet! Nope, it's not gonna happen.\n\nCoty ordered a number of very tasty dishes for the three of us to share, and so we enjoyed Mei's pan-fried pork buns, pepper-seasoned fried chicken (no feet, please!), hand-cut Zha Jiang noodles in a black bean sauce, and a sliced, boneless pork chop served with a tea egg. The egg was awesome, so we ordered some more of them. Mei, is of course the owner, and she & Coty got in to a very fun discussion about Coty's upcoming trip to Taiwan as well as her experiences with enjoying Taiwanese food in New York City.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal, but was glad that I went there with people who were more experienced in ordering this cuisine. The wait staff at Mei's was super-friendly, and very helpful about making recommendations about the menu.\n\nI liked this place a lot, and will gladly go back when I'm in the neighborhood.",

The highlight of the meal are the french fries which are served as a combination of Sweet Potatoes and Yukon Gold Potatoes.  The beer selection on tap are unique and fun to try.  My fiance got the Fried Tomato BLT which she loved as well.\n\nMy only critique is that service can be a little bit more personal and that the ambiance is a little too dark for my taste in a pub style restaurant/bar.  They have so many great pictures of dogs on their walls; I wish they would feature them a little bit better.\n\nOverall: 4 stars\nA great place to get dinner and drinks and kick off your night with a little pre-party.",

The place was packed and we were told we'd wait for half an hour, and then were seated in five minutes. The place was packed and loud, but the service was amazing. I didn't get the name of our server but she was from SoCal and deserves a huge raise and a hug! \n\nThe food isn't bad. I had just appetizers. the chicken quesadilla is really good. The nachos are not good--it's the cheese they use. My friends enjoyed their sandwiches and I had a bite of the salmon sandwich. Good, not great. \n\nThe drinks were very good. I cracked and tried their newest drink called \"the process.\" It had ginger ale and tasted sweet and I could drink it all day, it's so dangerously good. I also liked the Angry Orchard Rose Cider. \n\nCome for the service, the location on Lancaster, and for the bar/TV setup on game night. I'll be back.",

I was there celebrating a birthday, and the staff was very informative on the menu as well as providing a special experience. We ordered the pressed appetizer, and the waitress informed us in advance on portion sizes for appetizers and main courses, which I really liked. The pressed appetizer is really delicious and topped with arugula that is dressed in lemon and parmesan.  We also ordered a bottle of Malbec wine, which we got to taste first. This is a really good red wine we paired with the bone-in ribeye and pork chop. We ordered both to be cooked medium, and it did not disappoint. The meat was juicy, and well seasoned despite what some of the other reviews claim. It may have been my experience, but they were delicious. For sides we ordered mac and cheese, grits, and brussel sprouts. The mac and cheese is a small portion, but perfectly enough for two people. All of our food was amazing, and this is a great place to celebrate huge milestones in a serene and upscale ambiance!",

  "text": "My friend and I are in town for a week and Mai Thai's late night happy hour was the top of my list of places to try. \n\nWe arrived around 9:10 (it started at 9PM) and sat at the bar. The bar itself was empty when we arrived but there was a couple of large groups behind us and the solo bartender was very slammed. He was friendly but said immediately that it was not a typical Tuesday. \n\nWe put in an order for drinks (they are BOGO free during happy hour) and food (a variety of dishes for discounted prices)\n\nMy friend had 2 Siam Mules. I had an Apocalypso Now and something with \"Sunshine\" in the title. The drinks were super delicious and unique. \n\nFor food, we tried the Tempura Portobello Mushrooms, the nachos, the ramen, a firecracker roll and a mountain roll. The portions were ENORMOUS and much bigger than we were expecting. We ended up taking most of the ramen and sushi home. \n\nAll of the food was quite delicious except the sushi which was good but had a little too much sauce for our liking. The ramen was my favorite. \n\nMy rating is largely because of the service. While the servers and bartenders were friendly when you had their attention, GETTING their attention was quite difficult. It was a bit loud, they moved quickly past us, and they rarely made eye contact, all of which made it very hard to get service, another drink, etc.\n\nThe most frustrating part of the evening was that when our bill came, we were overcharged. We had 4 drinks total, but there were 5 listed on the bill. We were charged for 3, and 2 were 0.00. When we tried to point the discrepancy out, the bartender and server both argued with us that they were right and that we weren't overcharged. But we for sure were. So we overpaid by $9 because our Uber showed up as we were trying to sort it out and it just wasn't worth making the driver wait. \n\n\nSo yeah, food was good, drinks were really good, service was mediocre at best. Maybe we just hit it on an off night but the way they handled the bill discrepancy was ridiculous and kind of ruined it for us.",

They really accommodated us, printed up custom menus with couples' names, which was a super nice touch.  We  had \"family style\" apps, and the food, ordered off the menu, came out quickly.  They were also able to provide a wedding cake that we were all so happy with.  House wines and ability to order cocktails really added to the event.  Had scoped this place out about a month ago with friends, and made everyone order something different so we could get a good overview of the food.  The preview was great, food and cocktails really hit the mark; and yesterday's event was even better.  Shout out to the server (who we had both times)!  Didn't get your name, but wish you nothing but the best with the coming birth of the baby! Thank you to the whole staff!  P.S.

  "text": "The first one in Edmonton, so we had to check it out. It was JUST like the ones we visiting in the States so this review started out as 4 stars with the food and vibe feeling right on par with our expectation. \nThe biggest downside for us was the wait. We did read the reviews ahead of time and expected about an hour wait, the part that kind of threw us off was the hour wait and then a secondary line to go into after we handed in our buzzer...more waiting. Of course then there is the wait for food. When we did get in we noticed a huge empty section. I will say I am glad they took our phone number and we were free to wander the mall while we waited so we didn't have to stay super close and we could check on Yelp what number we were at in the wait. Since the mall was closing when we went there was no where to go but wait. They should really put in more benches around that area of the mall now that so many people are there waiting. \nMind you our server was super and very lovely - kept us posted on food time and entertained us with some quotes and trivia. We love that Forest Gump is constantly playing on the tvs, our table wasn't facing one so that was a bit of a bummer but there was plenty of paraphernalia to look at and talk about. \nWe always order shrimp here(Shrimpers Heaven to be specific), you have to get the coconut shrimp it is amazing! But this time we had a fairly big and Hungry group so we also ordered the southern fried chicken, Jenny's catch with lobster butter sauce, the Run Across America sampler platter, and one other fish dish. These other dishes were all super tasty! I would highly recommend any of them. But we definitely didn't have any leftovers from our hungry crew of 5.",

  "text": "We went here on a whim, because we needed to go to Target nearby and we were in the mood for Italian. On a Monday night (this was New Years Day), they were surprisingly busy. We were told the wait would be 10 minutes. Not too long of a wait; I figured I could distract my toddler for 10 minutes until we got seated and the bread basket was put in front of him.\n\nThe wait seemed a lot longer than 10 minutes. I wish I took note of the actual wait length.\n\nI was also surprised to see that about 1/3 of the tables were empty despite the wait time.\n\nWe were seated and we ordered an appetizer and my son's meal right away. After we got our appetizer (buratta mozzarella with tomatoes, basil and onions) and our salads, we ordered our dinners (both pasta/seafood dishes). We dug into the bread basket and immediately asked for more, because my son likes to eat carbs by the fistful, and frankly I'll do just about anything to keep him happy towards the end of his day while we're trying to dine out.\n\nWelp, things were ok until then. It took quite a long time to get our second bread basket. My son started flipping out so I took him out of the restaurant so we didn't disturb other patrons. (I realize this has nothing to do with the actual restaurant but it's still relevant.)\n\nRight before I took my screaming son out, I told my boyfriend to ask the waitress to pack up our food to go so we could get out of there ASAP. Well, maybe a half an hour later we got our food and our check so we could leave. They kindly threw in extra salads.\n\nWe got home and I was so excited to dig into the real dinner (after putting the monster to bed). Dinner was good, but by no means was it great. I got the seafood alfredo, and my boyfriend got shrimp/scallop a la vodka. Neither of our dishes had enough sauce; both sauces seemed runny and just pooled at the bottom of our takeout containers.\n\nBetween the meh pasta dishes, the fact that my son's kid's ravioli had 5 ravioli in it (for $7, I believe...), and the incredibly slow service, we will not be going back.",

  "text": "I went here for a group birthday party during restaurant week. The restaurant is nicely sized, large enough to be left alone, small enough to have a conversation. I also liked the view of the kitchen.\n\nThe Restaurant Week menu had a few vegan appetizers, plus a salad, and a vegan entree, but no vegan desserts. The server did bring out a fruit plate for me. I had the crispy cauliflower and lemon hummus as my meal. Both were well seasoned and I thought the portions were fare. Although some of my fellow diners thought their entree portions were small, everyone left nicely satisfied. Also the birthday desserts were a cute surprise.\n\nThe service was okay. Although we were asked several times how we were enjoying our meal, we were constantly waving the waitress down to get drink refills. I'd chalk it up to the restaurant not being used to a group of our size or our server being new. \n\nAll in all, I'd recommend the restaurant, especially when considered with the awesome hotel.",

After days of eating Cajun cuisine I was craving some veggies, broth and noodles, what I consider to be comfort food. I splurged and got enough for early dinner and a late night meal. Let me tell you THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!!!!!\n\nThe pho broth is flavorful and came with so much beef and meatballs. The bean sprouts were super clean and crunchy. The broth was still hot and the rare brisket were sliced thin and cooked quickly in the hot soup. \n\nThe dry noodle dish came loaded with fresh veggies. The egg roll I decided to add was so flavorful and the outside was still nice and crunchy. Loved the sauce that came on the side, perfect compliment to the noodles and veggies. \n\nSpring rolls were simply delicious also. All the foods were very well packaged. No leakage, plenty of silverware and napkins.",

On the times I've been there it's a man and guitar which sets the right mood for a happy hour not a rock concert. \n\nThe bartender and wait staff are very friendly (Not on a first name basis with any of them).  \n\nIt's a dimly light round bar with loungey banquettes around the perimeter.

I have tried many different items off the food menu and they only thing I can say I didn't enjoy was the polenta fries ( although in stone rose's defense I had never had polenta before and I think I just don't like polenta in general ). However, I would definitely recommend the seasonal flatbread, mussels, cheese plate, short ribs over Mac and cheese, crab cakes, and they have these Parmesan truffle fries that are AWESOME.

  "text": "I must have accidentally deleted my original review from a few years ago. Anyway, I gave it 4 Stars because it was pretty good. They used freshly brewed tea, and the drinks were usually on point. Then came the change of ownership. I have been back several times in the past 6 months, but never again. The last couple times I went, they didn't even bother to turn on half the lights, even though it was during business hours. There are usually only one or two employees, and even though the place is empty, nobody greets me when I walk in. They are usually sitting at a side table and look annoyed that I interrupted whatever they were doing on their laptops. The quality of their drinks have gone down as well. The tea always tastes watery and has no flavor. I even asked for no ice one time, and it still tasted like tinted water!  I mentioned it to the guy working, he said it was because they switched brands of tea or something like that. I asked if they could make something else, but he said \"it would probably be the same, but I can remake it if you really want me to\". I did. So he did. And it did. Still taste exactly like tinted water that is. Well, that was the last straw. Literally. The good news is that there are more boba places popping up in Tucson, so there is no need to cry over spilled boba.",

  "text": "We decided to come here since it was one of the closest Indian restaurants to the KOP mall, and I wish we traveled a few more minutes to go elsewhere. \n\nThe two stars is only because the food was half decent. We had the chana saag and paneer makhani with plain naan. We asked for medium spiciness, but it was actually not that spicy at all. Overall the food was sub-par.\n\nThe service we had was quite horrible, most likely because they had two parties going on, but still, it was a nightmare. We walked in and waited about 5 minutes at the counter until we even saw someone who worked at the restaurant. They seated us with menus and no one came back over for about 10 minutes. We ordered our food and they gave us some water. Another person comes over and repeats our order, to make sure the other person got it right, I guess. The food comes out 20 minutes later and somehow it was the wrong food! They gave us lamb saag instead of chana saag. They took it back and left the paneer makhani and rice. At this point we were not given silverware or serving utensils yet so we couldn't even begin eating. They came out with the chana saag 5 minutes later... and we had to ask for silverware. At this point the paneer was room temperature. Another waiter came over and asked us is everything was okay and filled our waters. We asked for the check and it came 10 minutes later. Overall, really bad service and no apologizes were really given.\n\nWill we be coming back? No.",

One day we asked the bartender to change the channel to the Alabama game and he told my buddy it wasn't a priority and he would get to it. Another time was sitting there for about 15 minutes before we were seen and all we wanted was a late dinner. So by the time they seen us, they just stopped serving dinner and they wouldn't make us any food. Another time it took forever for our waitress to see us again, so I just went to the bar and ordered our beer. Other times is ok.

However, after reading the glowing \"Review of the Day\" on Yelp for Pizzarella Grille, I finally decided to check it out.\n\nI walked in today and was given a nice Hello by a man who appeared to be the owner or manager. While they didn't have any large overhead menu boards, they did have some small paper menus, which were very easy to see. \n\nI ended up going with the chicken fresco served over fresh noodles! The chicken fresco was delicious with a nice, tender inside while the outside was fairly crispy, but not overly crispy. The noodles were very soft, but full of flavor especially due to the homemade cream sauce. Even better, it can with a nicely sized, side-salad that was absolutely delicious! The lettuce was of nice quality and had fresh toppings including tomatoes and carrots! It even came with a couple of Italian rolls. All of that was only $15, which was really great. \n\nInside the restaurant is very nice, especially for just a simple takeout style place. There is a large-TV and comfortable booths! They also have a nice soda machine with a wide variety of drinks. \n\nAltogether,  this is a great place to get fresh, quality pizza, salads and sides!",

I would get that again-- so dense and chocolatey that it was hard to finish! \n\nWine/beer: 5 stars. Large selection of both types of alcohol. Good variety of wine overall and I was also happy to spot a vineyard from Long Island that I had visited two weeks beforehand. The beer was heavy on Belgian-style brews, but I was delighted with the list all the same. \n\nService: like 6 stars, no lie.

Our meal kicked off with the most delicious chive biscuits with honey and bacon butter... I mean c'mon. Next we shared the conch croquettes-- they were very good, but didn't knock us off our feet. Next came the cold smoked tuna with avocado and crispy bananas-- really tasty, light and flavorful. What sold the deal for us was the goat curry-- it was truly melt in your mouth and absolutely packed with unbelievable flavor. The manager stopped by after our meal and we asked for his dessert favorites. He suggested the coconut panna cotta with guava and strawberry. It was the perfect sweet finish to end the meal, but not over stuff. Highly, highly suggest if you're in the New Orleans area!",

For new people, you feel very much out of place, or at least we did, from first walking in the door. Lol literally from the time we walked in the door. Apparently we went in through the side door, we didn't know (not labeled as such) and waited to be seated....and waited....and waited..... It wasn't like they didn't have waitresses either. One was on her cellphone and the other was getting her flirt on (neither of which I'm against but can you seat people first). One \"hangry\" fit later we're turning to leave when a waitress came over to seat us.\n\nOnce (eventually) seated the wings were pretty great and so was the dessert.

It was delicious.  I love pork belly.  I love runny eggs.\n\nThen we each got a seafood dish.  I got the Diver Scallops with mushrooms.  The dish was awesome.  She got the shrimp.  The shrimp came out with the heads on.  The presentation was nice.  Shrimp were very large, but they also had the heads on, so it was a bit of smoke and mirrors in terms of size.\n\nAll in all, everything we had was high quality.\n\nDownside:\n\nour waitress was good, but the service in general was unsophisticated.  The staff was very young.  I wouldnt be surprised if some were in high school.  It wasn't bad service.  I understand it is a function of being in the suburbs.

  "text": "So after Sunday mass, I wanted to take my mom for brunch. We decided we both want Bun Bo Hue. Bun Bo Hue is a noodle soup, something similar as a Pho but more spicy in the broth and the noodle are not flat like Pho noodle, its more like spaghetti noodle.The broth are made from pork and beef bones, lemongrass, annatto and shrimp paste. For proteins, you get sliced brisket, slice of minced chicken, pig feet and blood cubes. The noodle soup comes with a separate plate of tangle of herbs just as basil, bean sprout, shredded cabbage and lime. I order the Tea Thai and mom had the coffee drink. Our food and drinks was on point and very tasty. Mom approved! The place can be very loud with people. The whole time we had to literally had to speak up to each other bc the table behind us and across from us were so loud. Next time I might just call for take out. Less two star are for how I was not finished with my food but my mom were and the waitress just starts to clean up my table while I'm still eating. When I got to the counter to pay, the cashier didn't know how much to charge me. She had to step inside the kitchen to ask someone and came back with $29. There were no written receipts for my table. Glad I took a shot of my menu to figure out what I am being charged. The extra $1 must be for either tax and extra lime I requested or something.",

The Mediterranean food here is amazing and probably the best in the city in my opinion. \n\nI usually just get the gyro plate and the Lebanese tea! Service was good and prices are cheap compared to a lot of other places! The meat that comes with it is amazing and their tzatziki sauce is what tops it off. I definitely recommend stopping here for lunch if you're in the area!",

I went down to Florida Avenue, and was absolutely thrilled with the experience. \n\nI walked in with my backpack, explained my situation to the hostess, and she quickly found me the quietest spot she could find for me to sit and work. \n\nMy server Sam was awesome as well. When I explained that I was there mainly to work, but that I'd be ordering, she was super cool about it. She would come over regularly, check on me super quietly so as not to disturb me. She made sure I never went thirsty. She noticed when I had my headset on and just kind of gave me a quick silent \"OK?\" To make sure I was good. \n\nAfter work I was happy to be able to hang out for a while for some food & drink. Beer is awesome as always, and I am absolutely IN LOVE with the Buffalo cauliflower. \n\nI'm so happy Florida Ave. is in our area.",

  "text": "BBQ and vegan in the same name?  Really?  I don't know about the vegan side of the menu, but the macncheese is not the usual BBQ joint giant cheesy flavored dish. This macncheese was a bit lackluster with a hint of under-cooked flour in the sauce.  I don't recommend it. The tri tip was ok. Relatively tender for tri tip, but I really miss brisket on the menu. The tri pit is cooked medium, with a light flavor of pecan wood. The bun for the sandwich is toasted and works well with the meat. \nThe selection of Chivers sauce is good, but Chivers sauce is mediocre to poor.  Lots of ketchup with a few spices thrown in. \nI will come back to try the ribs and pulled pork, but maybe I'll bring my own sauce.",

We walked in and were kindly greeted with southern charm! We were the only ones there which was nice, we got great service and fresh cooked food! \nWe ordered a few different things on the menu to try based on the Yelp reviews... See below:\n\n:: Fried Shrimp + Fries * Yummy, and flavorful!\n:: Catfish w/ Jambalaya Cheese Fries * Freakin' Yum!! \n:: 1 Boiled Crab - $2 (Never had this before, so it took patience to pull apart, but it was yummy) Came w/ a spicy piece of corn, a small red potato and a piece of hot sausage.\n:: Cokes + Rootbeer * May I suggest a water tho! \n\nOverall it was a great time, food came out quickly and the hostess was super friendly! We took a lot of food to go as well! We loved the outdoor ambiance too even though we sat inside this time! Must check this place out before heading home of you are on vacation!",

  "text": "This could have been a solid five stars, if the atmosphere were a bit more exciting. It's not BAD, really, it's just kind of.... BRIGHT, and the color scheme's a little blech. If they could darken the colors and dim the lights a bit, maybe light some (more?) candles... that'd go a long way in an otherwise meh atmosphere. (And for some reason, the flat-screens showing sports over the bar just seemed a bit out of place and distracting, though I'm sure they get a bar crowd at times.)  Has the potential to be a total hipster spot; maybe that's why the atmosphere not all dark and brooding-- they want to keep it unpretentious? \n\nAnyhow-- the food was fantastic. Drinks were... okay (let me take that 5 star comment back... maybe more like 4.5). My house-made white sangria was tasty, but E's mojito was a bit overly-limed and underly-minted.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of small plates- garlic shrimp and 'sexy' grits on the suggestion of a nearby diner (DELICIOUS); bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese (SO GOOD); crab empanadas (tasty); something with goat cheese and tomato sauce that was good, but nothing to write home about ... and veggie cakes (yummy; reminded me of crab cakes) There were a LOT more items on the menu that we considered... We even thought of ordering another plate or two (hey, don't judge.. they're SMALL plates) but the waiter recommended that we stick with the above and then order more if we were still hungry (as it was, they had to combine our table with the next, empty one-- again, don't judge! The tables are small, and between water glasses, other beverage glasses, bread plates and bread basket, it was already quite full!) It was a good suggestion... the plates were small but not quite as tiny as other tapas dishes I've had elsewhere and though we were super hungry when we arrived, we were pleasantly full when we left (not always the case with tapas.)\n\nOverall, a great addition to the S. Grand dining scene. We'll definitely be back.",

For sides I had mashed sweet potatoes, roasted cauliflower salad, and yellow squash and zucchini casserole with TN white cheddar.

I especially like the cotswold and my girlfriend loves the goat cheese.  The wine selection is good, as you would expect.  I've had the beef sliders and chicken sliders, which are both delicious, but there's not a lot on the entree menu that I'd like to try.  So for that reason, it's not a place I would recommend for dinner all the time, but for some wine and cheese and a nice date, it can't be beat.",

I tried the Pork Bahn Mi. I have to say that for some crazy reason this sandwich has become a major trend in most restaurants. The Bahn Mi at Twenty Tap is probably one of my favorites. I love how they serve it with dill pickles on the side and the french fries are perfect. I can't wait to go again and try the Poutine. The menu is varied so it offers something for everyone and is not over pretentious. They also offer Vegan options which I think are awesome. If you're looking for a new spot to try I suggest this one!!!",

  "text": "5 stars all the way around from the customer service, the wait to the food! Our party of 8 was seated immediately. We had just come into town for the weekend for the Raider game. We requested separate checks and we were accommodated without hesitation. Not sure how it is in Louisiana but in California often times they don't like to do separate checks especially with parties of 8 or more due to them automatically adding 18% gratuity on large parties. \nOn to the food! Each couple ordered an appetizer to include a couple of orders of Charbroiled  Oysters and fried alligator nuggets. There are no words for those Oysters, they were out of this world. The alligator was also amazing! For my entree I ordered the shrimp and grits and was completely satisfied. I made everyone at the table taste it. Delicious! \nI really wish I could remember our waiters name, he truly deserves recognition for his excellent customer service. Despite the gratuity not being automatically added because of the separate checks we were sure to show our appreciation for our waiter when it came time to pay. Next time in NOLA we will go back to Drago's for sure!!",

  "text": "Okay, LAWD JESUS where to start where to start..\n\nIt was a family members birthday and we decided to go to islands! We were a group of 15 and they were pretty accommodating, so that was nice.\n\nAs we waited to be seated, some of us were at the bar ordering drinks before dinner. I ordered 2 DBAs, and a tequila soda with lime. Got the check.. and WHAT the actual F?  $37.00?!?!? I tipped 3 dollars for a total of 40 dollars for 3 drinks! Oh hellll to the no. \n\nI also noticed on a sign that DBA is on happy hour for 3.50 each..so IF I am correct. 2 DBAs = $7.00. So I'm guessing my tequila soda was 30 dollars. Fair enough. ‍\n\nWhen the bartender finally came around, I asked why my three drinks came out to $37.00 he said, \"I'm not sure actually.\" Gave me and itemized receipt with the \"correct,\" amount of now 27 dollars. Which technically is still 9 dollars per drink..still not right... I look a little closer and.. they had charged me extra tequila! 7 dollars more to be exact. Asked the bartender again.. and again he says he doesn't know why. He then figures it out, hands me a receipt for 18.00 which seems right. Perfect. \n\nWe sit down, food comes out fast, which is great. My girlfriend sitting next to me asks me if my burger tastes weird, I said no but she asked me to try hers. The bun on her burger didn't taste right, so she requested a new one. Waiter asked what was wrong with it, and immediately got her a new plate of food. Another waiter came up and asked her what was wrong with it, and she apologizes and says her food will be out shortly. THEN a manager comes out, asks her AGAIN what was wrong with her food, she then replies, if you must know, \"the bun tastes a little plastic-y,\" which then the manager replies, \"DOES ANY ONE ELSES TASTE LIKE PLASTIC?\" Way to embarrass her! Funny enough, she owns a food business in the Santa Barbara area. I just found that so Incredibly rude. \n\nThis was a Friday, it's now a Tuesday and my refund is not in my account. I honestly don't care to deal with it, or go back. I'll just walk over to habit down the block if I'm ever craving a burger.",

Of course I was hyped, more so because this was my first ever meal in New Orleans.  The shrimp itself was outstanding. I don't think I've ever had such fat, juicy mouthwatering shrimp in my life (drooling as I'm writing this review). All  the shrimps were gigantic as if they were on steroids. \n\nI had to look at the menu twice (or three times) to make sure $1.50 martini and Bloody Mary wasn't a typo. It wasn't!!! Not a big fan of either one, but I couldn't pass on such a deal. It was only my first meal in NOLA and I was already in love. Before I even ordered my food. \n\nCatfish fingers are literally meant to be eaten with fingers only. I tried to use a fork, and it just fell apart. And you have to hold it so lightly so you don't break it to pieces. It was delicious though not too special. Coconut beer shrimp was ok. Mr. B's BBQed shrimp was the winner, as expected, and I wish I'd ordered a full portion for myself, instead of sharing between me and one other person. I don't like messy food, meaning, having to peel and work for the food I eat, but I didn't mind working for this one at all. Licking the sauce off of my fingers was the best part. \n\nAlso, I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for the complimentary bread 4 times. So good!",

I could not believe how packed the place was after tasting my sushi. I mean, yeah-- the prices at Sakura seemed a little lower than its competitors, but the fish quality was disproportionately lower. At best, it was so-so, i.e. barely edible. The place was noticeably warm when we walked in --be wary of warm sushi houses (never turns out well) -- so we only \"started\" with two orders of spicy tuna and salmon (to test the waters). I was disappointed, especially after seeing such high marks on Yelp. Maybe if you order specialty rolls slathered in sauce and mayo, you won't be able to differentiate Sakura's fish from good quality fish... but I usually prefer more traditional sushi (sashimi and nigiri). \n\nConsidering the (few) options available in Indy, however, I won't return.",

You then realize how watery the sauce is and forcefully start dipping and scooping the sauce, hoping to get more to satisfy your taste. It is then that your entree arrives and you begin to start noticing that you're eating more bread than your actual meal and get so full from it than what you had ordered.\n\nMoral of the story: you stuff yourself on free bread over your meal, every time.",

We kept it simple with a large cheese pizza and the house beer that I believe was named the \"Dewbrew\", maybe. Anyways pizza was super hot and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. Im not a beer fan normally but I really enjoyed their DewBrew. It was a week nite and late dinner time. A children's bday party was going on at the tables next to us but they were polite and not at all bothersome since I didn't expect much ambiance wise from a pizza place. I would say its worth trying this place put and I plan to return and try a specialty pizza myself.",

We LOVE rockstone pizza and live right by Sahms Place, but unfortunately neither of those are open at 8am (although Sahms does do brunch later in the day)\n\nWe arrived about 8 and were seated immediately. As quickly as we could order it, coffee was at the table. We debated a while, but both settled on pancakes. I went with my token choice of bacon in the cakes and added a poached egg. \n\nI'm going to start with the egg: 100% perfectly poached. The cakes...tasted weird. They didn't taste bad, but they wouldn't make me want to come back. \n\nAfter eating I saw some egg dishes come out with sides of bread and remembers the yelp reviews talking about homemade bread. I think your best bet here is probably eggs with bread. \n\nUnfortunately, we had great service but I can't award more than 3 stars based on those mediocre pancakes. But, we promised ourselves we would try them again and eat eggs and homemade bread.",

THERE, I said it.\n\nWhile it feels a little like a chain restaurant to me (it's not really: there are currently two and they are adding one more out in the 'burbs) the food is fantastic. But mostly: TRUFFLE TOTS. Order them, eat them all, crave them, come back for more. Don't forget to dip them in the garlic aioli. If you don't take this route, I highly recommend the tatortot fondue. Or hey, why not get both. Tots on tots on tots.\n\nTheir unique burgers include a jalapeno popper burger (cream cheese, fried jalapeno, buffalo sauce) and the taco truck burger, and two of their other burgers have won prestigious awards including Zagat's 50 Burgers in 50 States (The Tennessee burger) and World Food Champion Highest Rated Burger (The 96 burger). They have other stuff on the menu, but there is really no need to even look. Get a burger, it's a burger place.\n\nThey also have alcohol infused (or not) milkshakes, which are pretty tasty, but I usually stick with beer here, as their selection is usually pretty good. And also, I never have enough room in my stomach for a milkshake AND burgers AND tots.\n\nGo here. You won't regret it.",

As I had no desire to embarrass my generous friend I did not say anything, not even when she mentioned that she was not very thrilled with her meal either.

So, they fact they choose to lie about serving real Kobe beef is disappointing to see. Second, all of the special rolls I tried were just overpowered by sauce that was smothered over the rolls.

They have every flavor imaginable and the tea is a tad cheaper than other stores around. I've also gotten good produce here and a lot of my cooking/snacking essentials. I like to give food (like dried fruit and unique snacks) as gifts - yes, I know I'm a little strange - to friends and family, and Essene always has the perfect item for this. They also carry PiperWai deodorant (from Shark Tank!!), which is hard to find in Philly.\n\nI have yet to try the cafe food in the back dining area, but it always looks and smells amazing - will have to try it out in the near future!\n\nIt's fun just walking around the store, even if you don't end up purchasing anything.",

  "text": "The only reason this is a two star review is because the woman behind the counter was SO nice. Otherwise, this would be a one star review. \n\nWe had a voucher (worth $24) because we were staying next door at the Nestle Inn. We each ordered the breakfast sandwiches on wheat bread and mochas. Choice of \"sides\" was vanilla yogurt or banana, so we ordered one of each. \n\nMy breakfast sandwich consisted of very dry wheat bread (butter? Please???), some kind of steamed (?) whipped egg patty filled with chopped ham, and some semi-melted cheddar. (The way the sandwich is described on the menu, I was imagining something closer to an Egg McMuffin, with a fried egg and a slice of ham.) Oh, and a whole, unpeeled and un-apeeling banana. Jean's breakfast was the same, except she had a little bowl of overly sweet vanilla yogurt. The mochas, while lovely to look at, were extremely sweet. The sweetness overwhelmed any other flavor in the drink. \n\nThe plate my breakfast was served on was chipped in three or four places. Seriously? I understand plates get chipped at restaurants, and I can overlook one or even two chips. But this plate was chipped on three of four sides (square plate). Tacky, even for a coffee shop. \n\nYes, the woman behind the counter was super friendly. She let us stand there for five minutes trying to decide what to order and was helpful explaining what was available for \"brunch\". If this was a review just for service it would be four or five stars. But it's for the food and the food AND coffee was not good. We won't be back. It's a shame, great location and so much potential.",

I added the provided tomato as well. Also? I ordered sausage and potatoes and proceeded to pile those on as well, plus some of the salsa the potatoes came with. Win! \n\nThe potatoes are alright ($3 small, $4 large). They have some garlic and other items with them but I like my potatoes with more seasoning and increased browning. The sausage ($3) is a thick sausage , not your tiny link or patty. My friend got the black bean patty and portobello patty. Both are tasty! \n\nTip: thinking about the portobello sandwich? It's $8.50. Or just order the portobello patty for $3.50. It just means you don't get the bread and couple toppings, but heck of a deal!\n\nFinally, dessert...our lovely waiter asked if we wanted some pie. Sure! Chocolate peanut butter pie is the best!! But...sweet merciful Odin. It was $5 and a tiny slice. Very rich, ganache chocolate with some good whipped cream on the side. The problem? THIS IS NOT PIE. Sure, some pies are not fluffy or gooey, like Derby pie or pecan pie. But pies in general are gooey awesomeness - like apple, chocolate, coconut, etc. This \"pie\" is more of a cheesecake texture. I loved my visit, but honestly the fake pie was a huge downer. Where can I find homemade delicious pie in this city?!?!\n\nOtherwise, surprisingly reasonably priced for broad ripple and tasty.

The Kettle chain was founded in 1968, and this location looked like it hadn't been renovated since it opened. If I could describe it in one sentence, it would probably be: \"Luby's after it's been on meth for a year.\" It's pretty sad looking. As for the dinner buffet, you are better off going to Wack Arnold's. \n\nFor starters, there was a very meager selection of food. Mystery meatloaf, baked chicken, sausage and bell peppers, or spaghetti casserole. There was a very sad looking \"salad bar,\" which is basically a giant bowl of iceberg lettuce, with old looking cherry tomatoes and dressings which look like they had been sitting there for a week. There were two employees working, and both of them had brought their children to work. As a result, no one came by to ask us if our drinks needed to be refilled or if we wanted our check. \n\nWhen we were ready to leave, we stood around waiting to pay for about 5 minutes. Also the advertised buffet price on the flyer is out of date; it is now $8.49 a person. The waitress started berating the manager when we pointed that out to her. Seems like a change in management is sorely needed. \n\nBottom line: Unless your only other dining option is eating a body part, I would stay far away.",

I love children...who belong to other parents, lol. The adult environment here is a nice change to the family hotels where children run and yell through the hallways on their way to and from the pool.  There are children here but since it is an adult-oriented hotel, they are much better behaved. The bed is extremely comfy as is my room with a sweeping view of Tampa Bay.  I sat for hours in my ringside chair watching the lightning from the afternoon summer storms over the bay. It was fascinating to experience. I highly recommend this upscale sophisticated adult environment. The hotel is very beautiful and the breakfast has also been first rate. The staff excels at customer service. There is a wonderful pool, surrounded by beautiful palm trees and lush tropical plants for privacy, so good for families too.",

  "text": "Just visited this place on a Friday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised with the amount of space in the cafe. There's a parkade so you don't have to worry about parking, and the inside is quite spacious - if anything, I think they could definitely fit more tables and chairs in. \n\nWe ordered the breakfast sandwiches - the good morning and the veggie one. We also ordered the breakfast bowl on the side, as I found the portions on the smaller side. \n\nI think the buns for the sandwiches here totally make the sandwich - they taste super fresh and have a hint of sweetness to them. They came regular on the good morning, and pressed on the veggie sandwich - so good both ways. I really enjoyed the egg on the good morning as they were fluffy and light, and the veggie one was great with the hummus. \n\nThe bowl was good as well, with the egg cooked perfectly. I don't think I would've been full if I only had the bowl, so I'm glad I got a sandwich of my own and shared the bowl. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for a cute light brunch visit with a clean, quiet environment. Can't wait to return for more of those buns soon!",

Snapper soup, watery, flavorless and a very small portion in a wide bowl that made it cool quickly.  Never again.  My selection off the very limited menu was a fettuccini and shrimp dish.  Pasty, globbed together pasta in a decent sauce with very large and flavorful shrimp.  Had it been less mushy it would have been good.  Others at the table shared lobster mashed and garic mashed potatoes.  Both were very lacking in fthe flavor you would expect.   Overall a so-so experience for a costly meal. Service was excellent, I must say.",

  "text": "Yes I am a fan of the food and the staff at DJ's, but what drives me crazy every time I go there is that I have to reapeat my order at least 3 times.  Once to the person who initially takes it, once to the second person on the hot dog line who then repeats it to the cook again, and then at least once to who ever is working the register.  Why they don't have you order and pay at the register and then work your way back to the front door is beyond me.  The cashier could staple a reciept with your order to the bag and then tell you what your number is, kind of like that other hot dog/italian beef place in Chicago that does pretty well, Portillo's.\nLike I said, the food and the staff are both great, and that's why I'm awarding them 4 stars, but if DJ's can't become more efficient, then I'm knocking them back to 3.",

It's friend chicken, a little spicy slaw and the softest bun!  I don't usually eat chicken, but I had to try a bite... and then another!  Amazing flavors that meld into yummy goodness!  \n\nThe bacon ranch waffle fries - bacon was crispy, the pickled jalapeños are so good, the cheese sauce with the ranch - wow!  We couldn't stop even though we were full! \n\nThe house salad is well-portioned and full of almonds!  The house ranch makes this salad!  \n\nThe jelly donut - the jelly tasted like fresh strawberries!  The donut is very dense and thick and more cake-like.  Delicious!  \n\nOur family of three ordered the slider 3-pack, waffles fries, salad and one donut and between us we didn't even finish it all - after a a day of site seeing!  Plenty of food for us!  \n\nNeed an adult beverage with your burger/sliders?  The \"brew\" here is coffee.  But we were told \"go next door and buy a beer.  We are BYOB.\"",

After hours in the car in bumper to bumper traffic we walked into a small, friendly cafe in the Sherman Mills complex near the Ballet and Ground Zero.   \n\nWe were welcomed with genuine warmth and were thrilled to see a variety of breakfast and lunch choices, with many vegan options.\nThe menu included vegan sausage and bacon, bagel sandwiches, a hummus and avocado sandwich, and a variety of vegan pastries.\n\nI went for vegetarian chicken-salad on whole wheat bread.  The sandwich was hearty and well-seasoned, with fresh lettuce and tomato, and came with a side of veggie-chips.\n\nWe setup our laptops and enjoyed our traffic-induced brunch.  Far from being disturbed by a couple of laptops taking up one of his four tables, the proprietor brought us two delicious vegan scones to try on the house.  The scones were made with cashew butter and raisins, and were  ludicrously moist and tasty.\n\nI definitely plan to return to the Cafe at the Mills without further diluvian prompting, and I'd recommend you give it a try as well.  \n\nReally nice people, with yummy food.",

  "text": "We have lived in this area since 1998 and have never eaten here.  We were going to try a new Italian restaurant in the same shopping center as Joe's, but they decided to be closed so we thought we'd give Joe's a try.\n\nWe were amazed at the selections on the menu but since we weren't dying of hunger we stayed away from the steam pot entrees and decided to order the Crabcake Dinner, a Pasta-Laya, and a calamari appetizer.  Other reviews call this place pricey and I would agree with that.  I would also advise not ordering anything on the menu that is not crab or lobster in a pot because this location is very good at producing those items.\n  \nThe calamari was hot and crispy but it is served with a marinara sauce.  We asked for and got some cocktail sauce which seemed to complement it better.\n\nThe Pasta-Laya was a very large entree.  The sausage and shrimp were very well-seasoned and flavorful but it just didn't have much \"jambalaya-ness\" to it.\n\nThe Crabcake Dinner was a major disappointment.  The skin-in fries were excellent.  The creamy cole slaw was the restaurant-standard stuff.  It was good and NOT watery.  The crabcakes were a disaster.  Having eaten crabcakes in a lot of restaurants, these were not crabcakes in the traditional sense.  It was more like crab stuffing you would put in a Thanksgiving turkey but in no way were they cakes. The very nice manager said this was supposed to be 75% crab, but the entree was a medium brown color from the bread crumbs and peppers and very little white crab meat was apparent.  I wanted to try these to get an idea of how their crab tasted but without much crab present, it was impossible to tell.\n\nThe manager comped the crabcakes and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit.  We told her that wasn't necessary since I had eaten half of it, but she insisted.\n\nAs we left, we noticed that there was a condensation leak from the air duct directly above our table.  The drops were splashing us.\n\nWe may give Joe's one more try.",

Sometimes it's real creamy and among the best soft serve out there.  Other times it's grainy and taste is weird.   They often have kids working there that could care less and don't pay attention.  They either give you something other than you asked for or they give a small portion.   Sometimes I swear a small and medium look the same.

Hellooooo hangover cure! \n\nI'm always a fan of Paneras that have a drive through window--even though it encourages me to be lazy. This Panera was like any other...good bread, good food, and good service. The mac & cheese isn't mind blowing, but it's still pretty good if you salt and pepper it to taste. Panera is known for baking their bread fresh every morning. So if you want to get something really awesome, go for a bagel or sandwich.",

But the first time we went was January 1 for dinner which was really good and then we came again on football Sunday when the Buca were playing and we still got great service and great food. \nI think my absolute favorite thing here is their chili it's amazing and it's got a nice heat to it. They also have a burger on a croissant with egg that's just delicious. We tried a bunch of stuff because they were four of us we've had their chicken and chicken biscuits everything we had was good the only thing that I didn't like that we got was there shrimp and grits kind of plain. \nTheir service was definitely five star and the prices are reasonable we will definitely be back.",

This used to be a local watering hole for us but since we moved to the burbs we feel a nostalgic pull if we ever find our way to East Falls.  They have good drink specials and the prices are good so long as you're drinking what is on special if you catch my drift.  Food is fairly standard, cool outside deck area too bad smokers make it unbearable to breathe.

Walked in and the three hostesses seemed bemused when we asked if they had a table for 3 - very unpleasantly told us the wait would be 45-60 minutes. Very surprising given that there was abundant Opentable availability. Left and went to Winnie's instead. Parking was also difficult. Overall probably would not return, hostesses were quite unfriendly and made us feel unwelcome. I've hosted for four years and it's really not that hard to smile or say something remotely pleasant.",

Server came almost instantly and took our order for our drinks, also did the oil and cheese for us and told us about all the new items on the menu. He obviously was very passionate and knew what he was talking about.  I was given another drink before I was done with the other one, which you never see at any restaurant. \n      We started with the Calamari which is the best that I've ever had. It was crisp on outside and soft on inside and not heavily breaded. Came with their homemade marinara which is the bomb.\n    For dinner I ordered the Veal Parmesan for the first time there and for the price was definitely worth it.  Expensive, but portion size was huge. The breading was not too heavy, and the veal was very tender. Also came with a side of pasta which is always amazing.\n    For dessert, since it was my birthday they brought out Vera's Lemon cookies with candles, the cookies were delicious.  I also ordered the Créeme Brûlée which was phenomenal! Very light and so delicious, it was phenomenal.\n     Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone that wants an amazing Italian dinner.",

When you think of pita, don't think of a tiny flatbread...think big - like Chipotle tortilla with an extra pocket.\n\nPay $6.99 or so plus tax and state what kind of meat you want (gyro, chicken, deli meat, etc).  Then, while your meat is on the grill, state which toppings you want - and don't miss out on any.  \n\nSpring mix, romaine, spinach, avocado, iceberg, tomatoes, olives, cucumbers, green peppers, jalapenos, onions, cheddar cheese, feta cheese, siced cheese, mushrooms, cranberries, etc.  \n\nThen, you get the sauces on there - hummus, balsamic, hot sauce, salad dressing, Tzatiki sauce!  After that whole salad in a pita thing, the chicken is folded in on top.\n\nSo you can read that you will not go hungry.  This place is great.  Plus, one late night, I was walking with some friends and had to go to the bathroom.  Like, right now.  Eat-A-Pita was really nice about letting me run in to use their bathroom.",

  "text": "I've been wanting to come here for a long time, so finally had time to bring my family of 4 in for dinner. Came in around 8:30pm and it wasn't real busy and was a great atmosphere. Placed our drink and appetizers orders. It took a long while for the appetizers. Ordered the loaded tots and pot stickers. So when they finally came out, the tots were not hot, barely warm. Tasted good for being \"barely warm\". At that time we put our dinner order in and I ordered a second drink. 3 P.J. burgers and I ordered the Steak. After sitting and waiting a very long time again, our dinner finally game out. The family ordered the burgers and said they were good. I got the steak. The steak was good although over cooked as I ordered it medium rare. My mashed potatoes were room temperature and hard to eat. So as I'm almost finished my steak, the waitress finally brought my draft beer (which I forgot I already ordered a long time ago) which wasn't that cold. As we are finishing our meal, the waitress never cleaned up our appetizers plates and our table was overflowing with dishes. So I picked up the finished dishes and put them on a table next to ours. At this time the place is empty and the waitress was busy talking to someone at the bar. When she finally came back and cleaned up some of the dishes, we ordered desert, Molton Chocolate Cake thinking it wouldn't take long. I should have known better. We sat and sat waiting. I observed the waitress who was at the bar talking, so I went over to cancel the desert because it was almost 10:30pm already. She saw me and quickly dashed into the back. So I went back to sit down. After about 5 minutes she brings out the desert which was good and warm. I made sure to get my check right away because I was so frustrated with the service. After spending $100 for dinner with the family, we all agreed that we would not come back because of the service. It's a shame because the food we ordered was good. It shouldn't take over 2 hours for a meal on a Wednesday night when the place isn't even busy.",

  "text": "I have been dining at Mr. B's for the past 12 years, and try to get there whenever I am in New Orleans. A bit more elegant than the Brennan owned Bourbon House, Mr. B's is decorated with warm dark woods and comes equipped with a small bar area which is where my party and I ate. It has become a little bit of a tradition for us to come to Mr. B's to chill out, pig out and have a few drinks. \n\nGary and Rich were our bartenders and they set us up at the bar with some Abita beers, bloody Mary's (a crowd pleaser), and easy conversation.  Now, on to the food. For starters I had a bowl of their Gumbo Ya Ya which comes with chicken and andoullie sausage. The flavoring is delicious. My only complaint is that I wish there was a bit more rice served with it, but that is personal preference. My friend had a special oyster and pea soup, which he enjoyed but noted it was lacking the oyster flavor he was hoping for. My other friend had a greens salad, which he seemed to enjoy. Moving on, for my lunch entree, I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was wrapped in bacon and they were salty, plump and juicy. They were very tasty. The surprising star on the plate, however were the grits. They were insanely good. I could just eat a plate of them and be perfectly happy. The consistency and buttery taste was absolutely heavenly. I had to defend my plate from my friends attempts at stealing them. Likewise, my friends BBQ shrimp was also fantastic. Rich sauce and plump shrimp are well worth the effort in peeling them open. I swear I thought my friend was going to chomp down on his plate he enjoyed the sauce so much---buttery, spicy, perfection. My other friend had a petit fillet that was wonderfully prepared accompanied by some eggs which I did not try. For dessert we split an addicting bread pudding that was sweet with cinnamon and raisins and soppy yet firm. Man it was good. I also had a special coffee called a \"Bob\" which had Kahlua in it and it really hit the spot. \n\nIt should be mentioned while we were eating at the bar there were a lot of people enjoying the Sunday Jazz brunch that was being held at the time were were there. Having some live Jazz music while eating such good food, enjoying some delicious drinks and watching some sports is a real treat, especially because the Jazz trio that was playing was quite good. As usual, Mr. B's just always delivers for me and I plan to return as soon as I am back in New Orleans.",

Basically, I paid $5 for a plate of inedible chips (it was the children's size), and sure enough I couldn't even eat them. They didn't even come with salsa to temper the dried bits of what looked like Kraft singles that were, at one point, microwaved on top.

Our waitress Justine (I believe) was awesome also, she was there when we needed her, attentive & super polite. This place has it together and knows what customer service is all about .

There were no other customers that should have been a hint, just two workers sitting in the booth talking stories. They were friendly, but the food was the worst crepes I have ever tasted, the person that was with me never had one before and said he'll never have one again. Here I was telling him how great they are, but not at this place. I don't understand how they stay in business.  The strawberries were sour, no powered surger as stated on the menu. Overkill on the chocolate it was like soup, making the crepe rubbery.",

The pad see ew tasted sweeter than what I'm used to, but nonetheless, I wasn't too put off by it. I would say, however, that the flavors were a bit one dimensional due to the sweetness overpowering the other flavors. But I was pleasantly surprised by their spice levels and would say they go a bit spicier than most restaurants in DE. That said, the spicy levels of our food were perfect. I think 3.5/5 is a better number for my rating.",

Unfortunately she didn't like it which was surprising because she loves lo mein. I tried it and understood why she didn't like it.  The noodles were over cooked and slimy. I asked if we could swap her meal for the kids fried rice instead. The waitress said sure no problem and went back to the kitchen with the plate. A few mins later she returns with the noodles saying they can't comp the meal and that I would have to pay  for an additional kids meal. I told her no thanks and just ended up sharing my basil rice with my daughter. Poor customer service and for that reason I will never return. Too bad because I was looking forward to trying the hibachi.",

The pizzas are made fresh in front of you, and with the exception of the cheese and one-topping, they are all one price.  \n\nWhen you walk in you get to choose your pizza type, and if you build your own you get to advance to the toppings station which is mind blowing!  Tons of amazing, fresh meat and veggie toppings for every taste.  If i have lots of veggies available, I don't even need meat, and trust me, there are plenty to choose from!  You can also pick your sauce, and I recommend the spicy red sauce.  VERY spicy, but super flavorful and satisfying.  \n\nOnce built the pizzas are slung into a fire oven and they come out AMAZING AND HOT!  So crispy and perfectly cooked from crust to center.  They have lots of salads, and some desserts near the checkout to go with your pizza, and I assume they are personal sized (oh boy that's embarrassing if they're not), but they have boxes out for leftovers.  \n\nI went on Friday after work, and it was dead...I was the only customer there, but I bet they are slammed at lunch.  I can easily see this becoming a once-a-week staple for me.",

However, I was impressed enough by La Indita to contribute my thoughts.\nWe were clued into this place by a purple-haired cashier at the Whole Foods on Speedway. I wasn't exactly going to take his recommendation, but then we stumbled across it while visiting the annual 4th Avenue Street Fair. \nMy husband is really into mole, but since each mole is unique he asked for a taste first. He was obliged with a generous small bowl of it (and decided he liked it enough to order). I got a combination plate with chile relleno, potato taco, and a spinach and pecan enchilada. I normally can't resist chile relleno, but I LOVED the spinach and pecan enchilada which was like nothing I've ever eaten before. I am positive the spinach used was fresh, not frozen, because it had just the teensiest bit of grit in it. We liked La Indita enough that we dined there twice during a five-day stay in Tucson. That's saying a lot. If you order the daily specials, it is a tremendous bargain. \nLa Indita was started by a woman from Michoacan who is still working even though she is well into her 80s. One of our granddaughters was our waitress and we enjoyed talking with her and learning about their family business. As is my custom, I asked about their culinary philosophy. I know that, among other things, they make their tortillas from scratch.\nI would have liked more time to work my way through more of the menu!",

The atmosphere was cold and sterile.  The service was great too bad the food and atmosphere were not as good as the service. Will not go back.",

  "text": "I've been comparing all of Indy's sushi restaurants to my favorite, Naked Tchopstix in Broad Ripple (see my review) for many years now. This is the first one that has surpassed it on several levels.\n\nSakura's sushi is fresh. VERY fresh. Much more fresh than any of the other sushi restaurants I've been to, both in Indiana and outside the state. The miso soup is the best I've had.\n\nIt is also VERY reasonably priced. My (ex) husband and I got saki, wine, miso soup, edamame and a spread of sushi for $50, whereas the same meal at Naked Tchopstix would have been at least $70.\n\nThe restaurant and the kitchen (we peeked) are also clean. Big thumbs up for that.\n\nThe waitresses - actually, the entire staff - are efficient and friendly. I don't know what it is about the places I frequent, but oftentimes the staff is rude or dismissive. Not the case here at all! \n\nThe bad news:\n\nThe ambiance in Sakura leaves a little to be desired. It's a little cramped, a lot wooden and everything just looks like it's in need of an update. The autographs that line the walls are fun to check out, though.\n\nThere isn't a huge selection of creative rolls, which is one of my favorite things about NT. The ones Sakura has are very good, but not very innovative. Very small gripe. We'll definitely be back!",

  "text": "This restaurant is the quintessential nod to California Cuisine--serving everything from a wide variety of salads and pizzas to burgers, hot and cold sandwiches and pasta dishes. If you think your favorite ingredients belong on pizza, they probably can get there at California Pizza Kitchen. Some local favorite toppings include barbecued chicken and goat cheese. And by all means,don't forget to save room for dessert so you can sample their New York Style Cheese cake or sit pretty in front of a standard but scrumptious hot fudge sundae. \n\nNo matter what your palette is craving in the pizza department, you can find it here. \n\nSome words of warning, though...substitutions on pre-made pizzas and some pre-prepared dishes as I remember from a few orders are a little more than their kitchen staff can handle, so if you order a menu item rather than create your own be fully prepared to like it as large scale changes may not be possible. \n\nAnd certainly be sure not to stuff yourself as full as any stuffed crust pizza that they might order, as you might consider taking in the carefully crafted, colorful decor that is such a dazzling surprise for their diners rather than a made dash to the dark caverns of their albeit clean and large public restroom.",

Our order was wrong/misunderstood and with that we waited more than 40 minutes for all of us to eat. The food was, you know, bar food.  I do have to say I find it hard to believe and disappointing that restaurants actually still serve kraft Mac & cheese. All in all I am quite surprised that after the wrong food came out and me sending something back that management never stop by. I was happy to pay for all of our food as we did eat it. Just a little acknowledgment would have been nice.",

  "text": "Had a Lovely experience here. I enjoyed almost everything that was served here. When we were seated by the hostess we were explained the table rule of once seated you have the table for an hour and thirty minutes. Which might have been relevant if we weren't the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was very helpful and informed us everything on the menu was tapas so we probably wanted two plates per person and then go from there. We ordered the blue cheese stuffed bacon wrapped dates and the pork belly, ...they were both decadent and delicious. We also ordered the lamb sliders they were good but not in any way unique for a lamb burger. We also had the fries with feta and gremolata...a little lack luster here due to the gremolata being just parsley....the music was nice and all of food was brought out when ready. The food was overall very impressive I had a lovely experience and definitely return.",

  "text": "Steak was \"ok\". Had Wagyu steaks at $118 each. It's a different steak. Not worth it IMO. I like the typical steak.  Staff was ok but we had to wait 1 hour and 45 minutes for our food \"because we had a very large table order\". That was a LONG wait.  Initially when we got there, our reservation put us at a table with stools so we asked if we could have a booth instead.  There were 3-4 empty booths.  After waiting 10 minutes, the waitress came back and accommodated us but not before lecturing us about \"if you wanted a booth, you should have requested a booth. Next time, when you make a reservation, request a booth\"... Well, news flash, there won't be a next time.",

The staff here will walk you through the whole process with a smile. I've tried poke bowls with both the noodles and the rice, although I find the rice far superior for picking up the delicious sauce. There are a variety of proteins- including veggie and non-raw options and LOTS of toppings. If you get decision paralysis, they also have some pre-designed options to make life easier. There's a sushi burrito as well, if you're dying to try one of those. Honestly, this is one of the only fairly priced, healthy, fast, and GOOD options in St Pete right now.\nAlso, Dole Whip.",

Some of the sandwiches are hit or miss but they make a solid pie and have good wings.  \n\nWhat really surprised me though is how good the homemade soups are especially the chicken pot pie.  It might be a little on the salty side for some palates but there soups are surprisingly good and something you almost never find at a basic sandwich shop.   \n\nThe only thing that is lacking is some of the young girls on the phone tend to screw up what your are ordering.   Make sure they read back to you what you ordered for a pick-up or delivery order before you hang up.",
