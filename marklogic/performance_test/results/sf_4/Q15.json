It was a great smoothie, however the prices are really high at $7.50. I've lived in many juice friendly cities that have organic fresh juices and smoothies and this is by far the most expensive place I've tried. I'm not sure my wallet can handle frequent visits but for a splurge once in awhile, I'll  definitely come back.",

  "text": "I am a big fan of mac & cheese. I could eat it all day, everyday if I had to. So when I happened to see this place as we were walking, I just knew we had to try it out!\n\nWe ended up eating here for dinner the next night, and I was so happy with our decision! They had so many options for toppings on their delicious classic mac recipe. I ended up deciding on the crabby mac, and my husband chose the basil chicken pesto. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to be ready, and we sat down in the restaurant because all of the outdoor seating was taken. We absolutely loved our meal! It was so filling that I had to take some of it back to our hotel with us. Next time we go back to Philadelphia for a visit, coming back to this place is going to be a priority on our list of things to do!",

  "text": "I had high hopes for this spot because I looooove middle eastern food. Unfortunately, it wasn't the outstanding experience I imagined it would be. Went with my work team so started off with a few apps - whipped feta, hummus and bacon wrapped dates. The table loved the whipped feta the best I would say. The hummus had great texture but tasted a little too lemony to be my favorite. The chickpeas however gave it a nice crunch. I also appreciate cucumbers along with the pita. For my personal meal I had the turkey sandwich. I had hoped for a little spice with the banana pepper vinaigrette, but alas the aioli overpowered the boring sandwich. The people who got the lamb sandwich loved it so that may be the way to go. The bahn bee had very hard bread and was greasy. The worst though were the sides. The fries were so hard that they were more like the potato stick snacks I recall as a kid. The vegetable salad side was too sweet with a weird sauce that no one enjoyed. All and all I doubt I would give it another try even though service was great and the atmosphere is cute. The food needs to step up the game!",

  "text": "I've been dying to step foot in this place ever since it opened so I was thrilled when a friend suggested we stop in after dinner.\n\nIt's a small place, but bright with elegant and simple decorations. The macarons are neatly displayed like jewelry in their case. There are so many varieties of flavors, but I ultimately ended up with the Coconut. It was delicious. Nice crunch on the outside and then soft as you bite down. And lots of flavor. The four stars is merely because I have had very few macarons in my day so not sure if it's the best one I've had yet or not. But so far it is!\n\nThey also have Norman Love chocolates...one of the best chocolatiers in the area. I tried a hazelnut truffle and it was truly heavenly.\n\nThey have gelato as well, but I was too distracted by the macarons and chocolates to give that case a look. \n\nThe guy who waited on us was also very nice...and French! Thinking he may have been the owner, or at least a manager.\n\nCan't wait to go again!",

I am a performer, not really a visual artist, but I love coming in not sure about what I want to do and just figuring it out along the way, buffing and blending as I go...Working on wood is particularly therapeutic to me- I love distressing the wood and then lovingly sanding, staining, and dolling it up it afterwards.\n\nAfter a friendly welcome from Reno's favorite Michael,\n we got to meet the lovely Ashly, owner of Board & Brush, and her charming team of helpers, all creative and fun-loving, who have a great time helping folks out with their projects. I'm fairly autonomous when working on creative projects, but Board & Brush really has a great balance of when to step in and help someone find their way, and when to just let folks get their art on. They're also full of helpful painting tips and techniques to help you create what you're going for.\n\nWhat was also cool about this event was that I didn't even know anyone there, but we were all singing and jamming along together as we worked on our signs. All the finished signs I saw turned out really cute, and everyone seemed to be happy with their final product. Thank you Yelp Reno and Board & Brush for a fantabulous evening! Can't wait to come back for my birthday!",

You could taste all the flavors plus the crust is delicious  \n\nI was very very satisfied with my meal and will be back. Everyone in the group was happy!\n\nFYI the individual pizza was enough for lunch and I was able to carry the rest home for dinner. \n\nThe only downside was they don't have to go cups. I always take the rest of my soda to go.\n\nOther than that it would be 5 stars!",

(The huge star in the middle of the menu can be quite distracting!). If you need a good sushi lunch place, then get the lunch special. They have an awesome deal at 3 rolls for $12, which includes either soup or salad. Guess how many choices of rolls you get to choose from? 43!!! Lots of choices to choose from, and I really digged the Pepper Tuna roll and the Alaskan roll. I had the crabmeat apple roll, but didn't care much for it.\n\nMore reasons to love this place: Service is fast and friendly, and they have LOW-sodium soy sauce. \n\nMy challenge is to try different rolls/dishes each time I go there, except the California roll. :)",

  "text": "Walking down 104 is always makes me feel good. I see a bunch of new places to check out and I'm just so excited to try them.\n\nI finally took the plunge one lunch to try their lunch menu.\n\nThe interior is super swanky, super chic vibe but with the sun out, my friend and I couldn't resist sitting on the patio to take in the nice weather. I was a little disappointed to discover that a lot trucks like to rip down this road which kind of took away the experience but I always enjoy patios nonetheless.\n\nAlthough I didn't try any of their wines, I still enjoyed the always default water. Their water had lemons in it which was a nice change.\n\nI decided to try their sandwich: panino italiano. I don't have a palette for Italian food but I'm working on it. I think this was my first experience eating authentic Italian meats so the taste was a little overwhelming. I came away feeling \"this meat tastes game-y\".\nTo be honest, it was a struggle to get through the sandwich. Only until I got to the middle I tried to focus on mixing the flavors of the tomato-y spread with the meat and cheese and the flavors mixed better.\n\nWaitress was friendly and came by to check on us frequently.\nMy sandwich came with a very small salad with oil and balsalmic vinegar.\n\nSandwich came out to about $12. \n\nI'd really love to come back and try their pasta but until I can figure out what I'm supposed to expect for Italian meats, I probably won't order the sandwich again.",

We ordered the rabbit ragout and were shocked at how large the portion was for a \"small plate\".  The same goes for all the plates we ordered.  The cocktails were inventive...loved the seelbach and the dark and stormy although the amexica had a few too many bold flavors to work for me (drank it though didn't I?).   The chicken liver pâté was phenomenal!  Duck breast was cooked very well!  The mussels were quite tasty but a little lacking in salt for my taste.  Four solid stars.

We met the owners and everyone was so helpful and accommodating. Their suggestions for sauce choices were on point. Food were delicious and fresh. \n\nSecond visit was ok. This time my salad tasted dirty, as if it wasn't washed and prepped before serving. I did saw the guy open a bag and dumped it in. I'm sure a lot of businesses do this as well but maybe we just had a bad batch? I don't know. It threw off my entire meal. I ended up having to pick around it.\n\nThird visit was better. I wish I remembered which combination of sauces I created the first time. Pretty sure I've tried every sauce they offer. \n\nOverall, nice place. Clean setting and bright, open space. You can either build your own bowl or choose one of their specialties. Love the freshness of the seafood. So far the best poke we've had in the city.",

  "text": "This was my favorite part of our trip this past week! We really wanted to do a swamp tour and read through reviews and ended up with Cajun Encounters. We liked the idea of not having an airboat which can be super noisy and windy. \n\nA few people from our hotel were going to the same tour. The concierge came outside to ask if we were all going and said the bus had called and asked us to meet them elsewhere because it was actually too big to fit down the narrow French Quarter streets! We walked about 3-4 blocks to Canal St. to meet the full size coach bus. (Cajun Encounters offers the pick up service for an extra charge, but it's worth it for ease). \n\nThe first thing I loved was that the bus driver was super friendly, a native of NOLA. A bachelor party was being kind of bro-y in the back and she quickly shut them up with made me want to hug her. She told them the night before they were so bad she'd called the police to have them escort the guys back to their hotel...\n\nAnyway! She asked if we wanted to hear some New Orleans info on our ride down and the majority of us said sure. The ride out to the swamp was about ~40 minutes. She told us about the different areas we were passing through, the graveyards, Hurricane Katrina, stealing crabs as a teenager, etc. etc. She was really enjoyable to listen to. \n\nWe got to the Encounters spot and she gave us very clear directions on how to check in, what will happen, etc. You go inside and show the counter your ticket/reservation/phone receipt and they give you a colored stretchy bracelet (like a livestrong one). That tells you what boat/group you'll be with. We waited outside for about 15 minutes and they started calling all the groups and walking us down to the water. We (and the girls who also came from our hotel) breathed a sigh of relief when the bachelor bros were not on our boat :)\n\nOur boat sat about 25 people - two long bench type seats, each facing outward. We were on the tail end so occasionally we sat on the very front of the boat more up at water level. I don't remember our guide's name but he was informative and funny. On our tour, we saw a few alligators - the guides know where to find some favorites. We also spotted some babies, some cool herons/cranes, A BALD EAGLE SWOOPING DOWN TO CATCH PREY (so cool! So mad I didn't get a photo), and even a baby and adult raccoon! At first our tour was primarily in a wider water area and I thought \"huh, not exactly what I pictured as much\" but later on in the tour, we went past our boarding dock and went the other way and THAT'S where the swamp I was picturing was. Narrow routes - I'm pretty amazed the boat captains can steer so well to not just hit every tree in the way. A few times he'd just turn the motor off and we'd try to spot critters in the woods. I got the sweetest video of him feeding the adult raccoon - it used its little paws to grab the hot dog! (I may like animals a teeny bit). \n\nThe tour was about 2 hours total. Fantastic. It was fun, relaxing, informative, and friendly - the other people in the boat were all easy going and helped point out cool animals and spots so everyone could get photos. Definitely go to this place if you're in the area! (also look for coupons - I think I saved us $20!)",

  "text": "I was looking through the YELP reviews trying to find something interesting to try.  I  stumbled onto \"Chef Ron's Gumbo Stop\".  I think my search was focused on corny names.  Anyhow, based on the good reviews, we stopped in on a Saturday evening.  Easily the best decision I made all week.\n\nThe food was awesome!\n\nThe \"Stop\"  is located in a strip mall just north of the I-10 Causeway cloverleaf.  There is a well lit sign on the east side of the cloverleaf.  If you are coming from I-10 you have a choice, You can make an illegal u-turn, dive into the right lane and pull up to the front of the restaurant.  The faint of heart can make a legal left turn, make the next two lefts and pull right up next to the strip mall .\n\nThis is a relatively small place.  Maybe 20 seats, a couple more at the bar. Decor stretches the boundaries of eclectic.....  We obviously missed the dinner rush, I think maybe 3 - 4 people were seated when we arrived.  We sat right next to the mermaid.  \n\nService was quick and friendly.  Someone I assume is Chef Ron was out a couple of times to check on us.  Nice, polite but not clingy - no war stories or life histories.  Interesting that he assumed we were from out of town (must be worldly demeanor and classic good looks).  When he found out we were from Destrehan, he commented that \"he loved to get locals in\".\n\nDown to the food - nothing short of great.  All the reviews raving about the seafood gumbo is absolutely accurate. The turkey wrap was enormous and stuffed full of real turkey.  My real find was the potato salad.  This is the best potato salad I have had in New Orleans.   \n\n$50 for 2 including drinks and tips.  I'm excited about going back and trying some of the other sides.",

  "text": "This is the first AMEX lounge I've visited. It was a quiet Wednesday early afternoon, so when I arrived to the lounge the front desk people were friendly.  The lounge is bright and modern. Certainly, geared towards the business traveler. There are not many couches or comfy chairs. \nThe bar is fully stocked with creative cocktails and a diverse wine list. I didn't look at the beer list in detail, but did notice they carried local beers on draft. The food is buffet style and Mediterranean forward. If it's not your jam, you may want to eat before heading in. I love Mediterranean so I enjoyed  the majority of the options. They have a small salad area with spring mix, beets, roasted acorn squash, tomatoes, tabbouleh, beans, and some others. For hot food there was brisket with carrrots, roasted potatoes, rice, lamb meatballs, and a squash/tomato soup. It was good, not great. They also had an assortment of cookies and a passion fruit custard that was entirely too bitter and sour. \n\nI didn't have coffee or tea, but they had some great options there. Because it was close to the holidays Santa made a brief appearance. \nNote: you can only order one drink per person. So if you're with others they will need to get their own drink. Mild inconvenience, but again the bar was wonderfully stocked. \n\nf you bring children ensure they are well-behaved as this is geared towards the business person. There's not a lot of room for them to move around. It's fairly small. \n\nI spent a good four hours there due to a delay, enjoyed the drinks and left with a full tummy. The bartenders and people clearing tables were incredibly friendly and service was prompt. \n\nOverall, good lounge experience.",

  "text": "If you like beer at all and are around the Philadelphia area, you really should do yourself a favor and take a trip to this brewery.  There are many interesting beers that I would actively seek out, and they come in a variety of sizes. I normally don't get excited about beer as wine or cocktails are my drinks of choice.  However, I felt differently after tasting the beers here.  I joined the UYE here last month, and I was impressed with everything about this place.  From the food, to the beer, to the service, it was a home run.\n\nI stuck with the 4 and 8 oz pours.  The 4 is great if you just want to taste something and are unsure.  The 8 is perfect for me to satisfy a craving for a particular beer.  I tasted many things I liked but my favorite was the Lil' Lady.  So tart, tangy, lemony, and refreshing which is my favorite style of beer. I also enjoyed the one that was brewed with spelt and guava, and also the experimental one with sushi rice and yuzu (Japanese citrus). I love the interesting combos going on here.  I usually only like sours, but Tired Hands proved me wrong!  \n\nService was excellent!  We had a big group of over ten Yelpers and water glasses were kept full and servers made sure we were able to order more beer when our glasses were running low.  It was also crazy crowded in there as it was a busy Saturday which made the level of service even more impressive.  In addition, the server has no problem giving our large group separate checks.\n\nThe Fermentaria serves up some tasty bar far as well.  I had a veggie burger and honestly wasn't expecting much, but it was very flavorful and the guacamole added some nice texture.  The bun was soft and fluffy (potato roll maybe?) and the fries appeared to be fresh cut.  It was a good sized portion, but not too much to where you push yourself to eat it and feel gross.  Just right!  \n\nI will most definitely return for the brews and the bites.  It looks like the draft choices are always changing, so I am excited to see what is available on my next visit!",

  "text": "Five stars for this location easily! Not sure why it took me so long to contribute to the reviews of this place, but better late than never. Everyone at this location is friendly and it's always sincere. Aside from having customer service that would shame some high end Philadelphia restaurants the food here is great. It is delivered efficiently, hot, and cooked properly. I personally am addicted to the spicy chicken sandwich and love to dip my fires in the Chick-fil-A Sauce. I also like that this location has family friendly nights: my favorite is taking my daughter to the annual father daughter date night around Valentine's. My little girl and I look forward to it - probably me more than her she is five and has no sense of time. I also really like their milk shakes and breakfast sandwich selections. Keep up the good work team Chick-fil-A, it isn't going unnoticed or unappreciated!",

  "text": "It's time to update my review since I wrote it back in 2017 (when they first opened). It's still 5 stars. Wish I could give it more after multiple visits and takeout orders. This is my favorite Thai restaurant. I love that they have a separate vegan menu with way more choices than any other restaurant. I'm not vegan, but I like the option and have found many wonderful items such as the eggplant basil stir fry, veggie spring rolls, and vegetable noodle soup. Everything they make is homemade including the sauces. There are no store bought sauces with added preservatives. They cook healthy and with lots of fresh veggies even in the regular menu items. They also don't skimp on the heat level. If you ask for it, you'll get it at whatever level you want. My husband won't go anywhere else but this place for Thai food. He's a Texan who loves spicy food. He gets his beef basil stir fry in Thai hot and absolutely loves it. He was actually the first person to recommend this restaurant to me. He happened to go there during one of my hospital visits. He said Preeda warned him of the spice level, and apparently was even impressed that he ate it all with no complaints. I asked him if it was Thai Boat. The previous restaurant that occupied that space (which was also good).  He corrected me and said that it's under new ownership and called Thai Legacy. We've been going ever since that time along with my mother.\n\nWe've been to all the other Thai restaurants in the area. They are all unique in their own way. I just like this one the best because of the variety. I've come to appreciate it even more after my recent visit to the Thai temple. I was drawn to the noodle soup and the flower teas at their Sunday market. I was craving that soup during the week so I pulled up the Thai Legacy menu and noticed that they have many variations of this soup on their menu. So far, I've had the pork noodle soup and the veggie one with tofu. The pork noodle soup has 4 different noodle options (small rice noodles, large rice noodles, yellow egg noodles, or clear bean noodles) and the veggie one has 3 types (no egg noodles). I got the clear bean noodles and asked for the spice tray on the side so that I could add my own heat. The takeout soup orders come with chili pepper spice, paste, and pickled jalapenos. It's a huge portion that can definitely be 2 meals or split between 2 people. It was so good, and reminded me of my morning at the Sunday market. It so comforting and I'm so happy that I can get it Tuesday thru Sunday when needed. I was also happy to see that they are now serving exotic iced teas such as Roselle Hibiscus, Butterfly Pea Flower, and Lemongrass tea. I've had the first 2 teas and they are refreshing. It's unlimited refills during lunch.\n\nThis restaurant gets better and better each time. It's a wonderful and hard-working family that owns it. They cook with love and health in mind. The service is always friendly and welcoming. They remember us every time we come in (especially my mother). We'll continue to return often.",

Looking at their menu, I was very impressed with the variety and especially with prices. Definitely not as pricey as my normal juice stop. I love that all the fresh fruits and veggies are on display also. I chose a regular sized \"garden state\" smoothie which was sweet and light. I can't wait to come back and try the juices, though. Less than 6 bucks as opposed to the normal 9/10 range? Maybe the bottles are alot smaller. We shall see. I'd also like to mention how friendly the staff was....super welcoming and informative, they seem very excited about their new business. I wish them luck and I will for sure be a repeat customer.",

  "text": "The Natural Cafe is A-OK. Located on State Street, we stopped in here on a Friday afternoon as we were strolling down to the beach. It's order-at-the-counter, and there wasn't much of a line, so the wait was quick. I ordered the fish tacos (I'm from North Texas, so any excuse to eat fish in a coastal town I'm going to take). My boyfriend ordered the tuna fish sandwich with a side salad. My mom ordered the cup of vegetable soup, and my dad ordered the nachos. \n\nOnly my boyfriend was truly wowed by his food. If he were writing this review based on his experience of the food alone, I think he probably would give them 5 stars. He loved the sandwich and the salad, and I tasted both and have to say they were great. The rest of us were okay with our meals, but not all that impressed. My fish tacos were a little strange. They were smothered in tomato sauce and cheese, and topped with lots of shredded carrot. It wasn't bad, just a little odd. It was served with blue corn tortilla chips and salsa, which were pretty good. \n\nMy mom found her soup to be too salty, and the bread served with it tasted stale to her. My dad's nachos weren't too warm when they arrived, and quickly got cold as he ate them. He found it odd that there was so much salsa and no beans at all.\n\nOverall, not our favorite spot, but a good option for a healthy meal. The place has lots of vegetarian options, which is awesome. Come here for a sandwich and salad!",

We opted for the bottle of champagne w/ OJ $35. I got a shot of peach flavor to go with my mimosa. I enjoyed every drop and loved mixing in the OJ, champagne and peach! On point...delicious. \nBuzzzzzed! I ordered the hangover tots!!! I did not know I wanted this in my life! I loved this yummy,  hot mess, of a concoction! Friend is vegan and she enjoyed her meal too!\n\nMade reservations several days in advance for Sunday brunch on OpenTable. Outdoor seating was the only spots available (at the time)-- I snagged it!

  "text": "This restaurant review is really only about the Happy Hour.  Lately, that has been my MO.  In the summer I don't like to eat huge meals so Happy Hours work great.  It's really hard to judge a restaurant correctly this way.  So guys, just remember this was a Happy Hour review and doesn't reflect their true menu.  Went there Friday night with our friends.  It was the four of us all looking to share some delectables.  Unfortunately, it didn't quite make it for us.  We shared the Calamari which was fried but came dry without a sauce, no lemon.  It was tasty but I believe could have been better.  Also the smash burger.  I couldn't understand why they called it that.  Except that is a new term for a trend in burgers these days.  Since one is opening up in town with just that name (Smash Burger) on Grant and Swan.The burger was very plain and tasteless.  Also ordered the Mahi tacos which just got a so so for us.  The highlight was the fish and chips.  Actually, the fish was made to perfection.  Crispy, dry on the outside with a beautiful white fish inside.  I'd highly recommend that.  The fries were very plain and ordinary to say the least.  Ordered the salad on the happy hour and it was totally bland. I would come back just for the fish and disregard the chips. The service was fine.  We had a lovely, cheery server.  The place is trendy and quite lovely with the views of the mountains.  By the time we left the place was hopping mostly at the bar.  It is definitely worthwhile going to.  I love to see Restaurants do well here in Tucson. I will be back.  I'm not trying to bad mouth this place but  because I am an honest reviewer I might be coming off a little harsh.   I will be back and get the fish and try some other interesting dishes.  They do have an extensive selection of Happy Hour dishes.  Even more than other restaurants.  So certainly it is worth coming here and enjoying this trendy spot.",

I was a bit nervous about the food due to this, but the food was actually very very good.\n\nI started with a sangria rita (2 of my favorite things mixed together).  It was a very large drink and for the size, I don't think that the $9 price tag was too bad.  We started with the sriracha guacamole (YUM) and the loaded queso (it had bacon in it) and both were very tasty.  For my meal I had the grilled avocado (filled with fresh ahi tuna and crema sauce) and the Mexican street corn.  The ahi tuna was SO incredibly fresh and the avocado was just perfect - highly recommend this dish.  The Mexican street corn was also very well done and quite scrumptious!

I went for the five-piece combo with original chicken, slaw as my salad, and the corn fritter as my side (as opposed to fries). The chicken was crunchy and extremely juicy, while the slaw was fresh and had lots of hearty carrot in it. I loved the corn fritter, which was served in a milky, sweet liquid. I did not find the chicken too greasy, and the price point was great. The place is rather small with most people doing take out. You might have a hard time finding a seat if you want to dine in during the lunch or supper rush.",

  "text": "For restaurant week, I decided to come back to the restaurant that was so good, it inspired me to start yelping. Unfortunately, I came away more disappointed than the first time. But...I feel like I can't complain too much. I mean, it was restaurant week, so they were packed. And I got SO much food for $30.12. Let me summarize the pros and cons of this visit:\n\nPROS: Exceptional service. They were busy, so I almost expected slow service. But not at all- we were seated right away and had two people waiting on us. Love it when the waitstaff take initiative rather than wait for someone else to take care of the table. The appetizers were delicious- chicken cheese pot pie had an amazingly flaky crust and love the cherries inside. Ox tail was also great. Desserts were semi-sweet, as advertised. Love the apple, pumpkin beignets were okay- probably wouldn't order it again. Generally, though, flavors were spot on.\n\nCONS: The main taysts were disappointing. The lamb came out and half of my cut had the texture of meatloaf. The other half was fine, which made me think it was not on purpose. So I looked over at a neighbor's lamb, and it was also the consistency of ground meat. Is that right? My neighbor was also not pleased and complained about his lamb. The meatballs were dry. The textures of the meats were just not good.\n\nIt was a great deal. But I feel like Tayst can do better.",

  "text": "The Matthew Ryan Veterinary Hospital was recommended to me by Banfield at Petsmart, after months of a smaller vet clinic telling me that it was just my dog's diet. It turns out that the bleeding in the stool was due to gastrointestinal cancer, and a tumor was removed during surgery. The surgery was gratis by the main veterinarian that took care of our 9 year old Shih Tzu, Max. My sister and I opted to do the cancer treatment which lasted for about a month and a half, until we had to take Max to the ER and have him put down. The warning that the main vet gave us was that if Max wasn't eating and not moving, he was in pain and had to be taken to the ER. The desk didn't offer any condolences as I was sobbing and telling them my choice to have Max cremated by himself so we could keep his ashes. About a week or so later, my sister went back to pick up his ashes, which was housed in a nice wooden chest with his name engraved on the top as well as two keys to open the lock. The experience was very hard for us. I had especially grown very attached to Max and was willing to do what it takes to try to save him. Although a vet had initially said he had 6 months, cancer is unpredictable. One day you could be fine, but the next day, you could be close to death. \n\nThe veterinarians are one of the best in the country. They are very knowledgeable and answer any questions you may have. The vet that I often communicated with was very prompt in returning our phone calls and giving us very good information about what to expect. It was a very nice gesture that they removed the surgery fee which was the largest on the bill. Like all the vets I've seen, they genuinely care about your pet and it's QUALITY OF LIFE. I want to emphasize that because it was something that was often said, especially with a disease like cancer. At one point, the vet techs let us check out Max early because he was distressed and wanted to go home.\n\nThe vet techs are awesome. You can often see them walking dogs outside. They shower your dogs with kisses and really love animals. They provided the best support and really wanted the animals to feel at ease. This was important to us because Max had separation anxiety. The vet techs are awesome and I'm glad they had loving people to watch over Max.\n\nThe hospital is expensive, it made me glad I had decided to get pet insurance. If you are unable to pay the high bills, they do have a payment program. I think the price is worth it because you are getting the best care for your pet. \n\nThe location is accessible by public transportation. You can park in the little lot in front of the hospital but there is a small fee. There is also metered street parking. The drop off area is pretty tight. I had to bring Max in for his chemotherapy pretty often so I was there about every other week. I dropped him off in the morning and picked him up at night when he was done. There is a small waiting area and I remember other owners waiting and talking about their pets and chemotherapy. Yeah, I wasn't the only one. Past the waiting area are some vending machines for soda, candy, and coffee.\n\nLastly, Banfield and the vet and the vet techs of Matthew Ryan sent us a condolence card after Max went to the Rainbow Bridge. It wasn't just a short message of \"I'm sorry for your loss.\" They left nice messages talking about how sweet Max was and other things. There had to be about 10 people who signed that card. It really made us so incredibly happy. \n\nMax is in a happier place, ruling his shih tzu tribe. He really changed our lives and started this love affair for all dogs. He was given to us in his senior age and although we only had him for about 2 years, he made a huge impact on our lives. \n\nThis was 2 years ago and I hope I don't have to go back for a long time but I do recommend this hospital and I think they are the best you can get for your pet.",

We stopped by throughout the day and no one was there at the ticket stand. When we arrived at the tour time, the woman siting there told us not to tell anyone that she wasn't there throughout the day. Then, she refused to take our credit card.

This the clearance section was buy one get one free so I scored three pairs of earrings and two big necklaces for only just $12!\n\nSo as you see I probably can tell if my review that I get overly excited just walking into the place.

  "text": "If I were eating my last meal on Earth, raw oysters would definitely be one of the appetizers.  When my wife finally nagged me to make the 5 1/2 hour drive to New Orleans, Drago's immediately became a must stop during our culinary eating weekend.  My wife and I are BIG fans of the raw oysters but we had to stop at Drago's to try their much beloved chargrilled oysters.  We arrived at this location at 7 p.m. on Friday night and were quickly seated without any wait. As we walked by the open kitchen, where we saw the oysters getting shucked and grilled, our mouths began to water like a rabid canine.  \n\nWe ordered a dozen chargrilled oysters and a dozen of the raw oysters. I also ordered the grilled drum (similar to redfish) but the oysters were the reason we came.  The raw and chargrilled oysters arrived and we quickly noticed these oysters must have been hormone fed because they were gigantic.  The chargrilled oysters are as good as other reviewers say they are and lived up to our expectations.  \n\nHOWEVER, we still loved the raw oysters more. That's because when you cook an oyster, you basically kill the natural flavors and they become whatever ingredient you put on them. In this case, they tasted like garlic, butter and wood fired smoke.  The sweet/salty brine and plumpness were gone from the chargrilled oysters. To us, it's like taking a piece of toro and chargrilling it.  Some things are meant to be eaten raw.  Thankfully, we were also able to enjoy the fantastic raw oysters.\n\nAs a footnote, the grilled drum was very good and would be a formidable star, if not for the brighter oyster star in this universe.",

That being said, I loved that we got to make friends with the couple of ladies sitting next to us.\n\nWe ordered the bologna scone (no longer available), ancient grain porridge, and potato & celeriac latke. The scone was excellent and delightfully surprising with the bits of salty bologna. The porridge was very good and I would wait in line again just for that. The latke was unique and lighter than a traditional normal all potato latke, and the onion marmalade was tasty.\n\nThe vibe was relaxed and friendly, but service was relatively slow and pretty loud. The building it is in is very unique and has tall ceilings and that may have been what caused the higher volume. \n\nAll in all, this is my favorite $30 brunch in the city- a little pricey but a great place to eat and hang out, something that is not common at other brunch places.",

I'm not a beer drinker so I can only judge on the food - which was superb.\n\nHam and brie on a croissant could be a win, or a fail... here it is definitely win. Flaky fresh perfect croissant + thinly sliced ham + brie = delicious. Add sides of a small pile of nuts, a handful of fresh red grapes and an apple sliced and then drenched in honey? Oh, yes please.\n\nThe build out is excellent - heck, I remember when the joint was a dog grooming place and a junky furniture shop - huge step up from there. Side room has a small stage for music acts, and I'm told the happy hour can be SRO. Chatted with the bartender and food prep guys for a while - great neighborhood place. Wish it was here back when I lived in Seminole Heights. Yeah, a definite great addition to the 'hood.",

Both experiences began with a nice warm welcome, followed by quick service, great coffee, and delicious little desserts!\n\nOne instance, the woman who helped us (possibly the manager/owner?) was very friendly and helped our incredibly indecisive group make decisions we were all happy with! She made some really great recommendations and even let us try a couple samples! I can't remember specifically what we ordered because we just ordered a bunch as a group and honestly everything we got was delicious!!\n\nThe second visit, same woman helped us, same great attitude and service! This time I tried a creme brûlée special they had which was FANTASTIC! So happy that I tried it!!\n\nThe place is always nice and clean, they love dogs, parking is on Central and usually not an issue, and the whole experience is just nice and positive!!",

Right after dinner we drove there and knew that this was the place for us. We scheduled an appointment and after the first meeting we were in love! Every venue we had visited made us feel like an \"appointment\" but Carol and Marc made us feel like we were at home. It was all the little things...The way they had a box of desserts as a gift for us (and their desserts are BOMB), or the way they dressed up the venue for a mock wedding for us that brought me to tears. This couple is really such an inspiration because they are doing what they love. Every step of the way they strive to make your event so special. It's because of this passion they have helped us make our wedding a reality. \n\nGuests could not stop talking about how great the food was and so many people told me they had 2-3 plates of food. All our desserts were gone at the end of the night! I love this catering company from the bottom of my heart! They host events at their venue and are also able to cater to the venue of your choice.\n\nHighly recommend them!",

  "text": "Sometimes while shopping at this buffalo, I feel like they are selling used clothing for the same price as new clothing but it is still possible to find some rarities or even some real steals. You can even find new clothing there. I like how they arrange the clothes according to which holiday/celebration is coming up, for example, all of the red dresses are placed on the front racks before The Red Dress Run comes up. It is a fun place to try new things since they have every kind of style, from hardcore punk stuff to preppy things. They also have some of the cutest jewelry but almost every piece I've bought has broken super quickly. Sometimes I barely make it out of the store before it breaks. I also wasn't a huge fan of the dress selection last time I was in, lots of patterns that kind of hurt your eyes and cuts that were not flattering. When trading or selling, Buffalo loves brand names, in season items or extremely unique pieces. They wont take most of your clothes but they can donate items you no longer want. The new store is a lot bigger with way more breathing room.",

  "text": "The first one in Edmonton, so we had to check it out. It was JUST like the ones we visiting in the States so this review started out as 4 stars with the food and vibe feeling right on par with our expectation. \nThe biggest downside for us was the wait. We did read the reviews ahead of time and expected about an hour wait, the part that kind of threw us off was the hour wait and then a secondary line to go into after we handed in our buzzer...more waiting. Of course then there is the wait for food. When we did get in we noticed a huge empty section. I will say I am glad they took our phone number and we were free to wander the mall while we waited so we didn't have to stay super close and we could check on Yelp what number we were at in the wait. Since the mall was closing when we went there was no where to go but wait. They should really put in more benches around that area of the mall now that so many people are there waiting. \nMind you our server was super and very lovely - kept us posted on food time and entertained us with some quotes and trivia. We love that Forest Gump is constantly playing on the tvs, our table wasn't facing one so that was a bit of a bummer but there was plenty of paraphernalia to look at and talk about. \nWe always order shrimp here(Shrimpers Heaven to be specific), you have to get the coconut shrimp it is amazing! But this time we had a fairly big and Hungry group so we also ordered the southern fried chicken, Jenny's catch with lobster butter sauce, the Run Across America sampler platter, and one other fish dish. These other dishes were all super tasty! I would highly recommend any of them. But we definitely didn't have any leftovers from our hungry crew of 5.",

The broth was still hot and the rare brisket were sliced thin and cooked quickly in the hot soup. \n\nThe dry noodle dish came loaded with fresh veggies. The egg roll I decided to add was so flavorful and the outside was still nice and crunchy. Loved the sauce that came on the side, perfect compliment to the noodles and veggies. \n\nSpring rolls were simply delicious also. All the foods were very well packaged.

Thanks to my classpass, though, I jumped at the opportunity to take a class here. I hear the drop in rates are decent and if I wanted to take more classes at this studio than my class pass allows, which I might!, I wouldn't be upset with the prices. This studio is SUPER clean. I know most studios that you go to are pretty clean, however, I found this place to be immaculate. It's got wood floors all throughout and walking around barefoot I didn't pick up any floor dust or anything. \n\nI went to the 90 min hot vinyasa flow with Cecile (spelling?- sorry if it's wrong). I think 90 min was too much for me, I usually go for 60 min classes and consider 75 min classes to be pushing myself. I loved the pace of the class though; it was slower, even though we were doing sun salutations and we were able to hold stretches for longer. It was really beneficial and I felt rejuvenated after leaving. Another great thing is that there are no windows and the heat is real! It's not some open air space (which is nice sometimes) that uses space heaters and claims to be a hot yoga studio. This is legit 95 degrees and you will sweat! Make sure to bring water to class and a towel for your mat and yourself. The instructor was great, she came around and helped every person at least once through the various poses. The only thing I didn't like is that we did a lot of hip stretches that required us to be on one of our knees and my knee started getting really irritated after our second set of hip openers. I would have preferred pigeon pose or something else. Lastly, I didn't think I wouldn't like the no mirrors deal at this place, but I actually really liked it. I felt like I had a greater awareness of where my body was and I wasn't concerned with what other people were doing or what I looked like to other people. I'll definitely be back here!",

I saw the sign for a bakery out of the corner of my eye as I was driving down Bearss Avenue and was curious what the place was like. La Familia is a charming Mexican bakery. While there are two small tables outside you can sit at this is more of a place where you grab your items and go. There are display cases to your front and left as you walk in showing all sorts of wonderful looking treats. There are donuts, conchas, muffins, cookies, cakes, just to name a few. My favorite dessert I've tried so far was a rectangular slice of vanilla cake with peach and guava waves decorating the top.  It was delicious!  Their cuban sandwich felt like a brick in my bag it had so much weight to it.  The cuban bread was excellent also.  I've also tried their ham and egg sandwich, which also was a substantial amount of food. Their prices are also great!  I was very surprised that every dessert in the side display cabinet is only 99 cents. The people that work here were very patient with me with my endless \"What's that?\" questions.

If you are a lover of architecture, this Spanish Colonial Revival style building is quite an enjoyable visit. I always was in great belief that Greeks had a hand in some way in almost every new architecture structure that exists and they definitely did with this structure. The new building replaced a smaller Greek revival courthouse at one time long ago.  \n\nWe visited the clock tower, which has many views from all directions. The clock tower mechanics some levels below was surely quite impressive engineering. I also enjoyed reading the history painted on the walls in the beautifully architected main court room.

Granted it is January and we are right by the harbor but it couldn't have been this cold the moment it came out of the kitchen and onto our table. I ordered clam chowder & lobster pasta. My boyfriend got the uni and scallop & lobster roll. He said he enjoyed them both, although he wasn't quite sure if the uni & scallop were worth their price. I loved the clam chowder - so much meat in it and it didn't feel like it was just all soup. Unfortunately, today was the day that I found out I am lactose intolerant so I didn't react well to the soup. My pasta was very flavorful, however. Big chunks of lobster in it!! Well worth its price.\n\nService was phenomenal - very nice and prompt. The wait time wasn't terrible, and I was surprised because it's New Year's Day! Parking wasn't too tough to find. There's a lot of places where you could park 90 minutes for free. Highly recommend this place if you're in the Santa Barbara area.",

  "text": "I've been wanting to eat here ever since I had heard about it, but it's a bit of a drive (not really). It's also a bit pricey, so it's not a place I would normally just drop by if I'm in the area. The menu looks fantastic, so it was only a matter of time.\n\nThe decor is not what one would picture when thinking of a British restaurant, kind of rustic with lots of rough wood and brick. There are a bunch of British inspired accents of which my favorite was a large canvas with London busses and street signs.\n\nThe menu is filled with British staples like rarebit, scotch eggs, black pudding, sausage rolls, bangers and mash, and fish n chips, but invigorated with new ingredients. For example, take the fish n chips; Icelandic cod, anchovy dill remoulade, house made clam ketchup and malt vinegar. The whole menu is filled with unique and wonderful sounding food.\n\nWe started with a couple drinks and thankfully, the menu filled with a lot of European macro beers, also had a good selection of local craft beer. The wine selection was decent and varied and they offered gin, whiskey, and port as well.\n\nAfter drinks, we chose the cucumber & charred cabbage salad (cucumber, caramelized pumpkin seeds, tarragon, mint and deep fried breadcrumbs) and the crispy fried eel (brown butter and birch stout emulsion, eel, and breadcrumbs again and some greens). Both were excellent and left us wanting more.\n\nThankfully, those were just appetizers and soon enough our chestnut pasta and braised beef cheek pie mains arrived. The chestnut pasta (pasta, brown butter, mushroom chestnut truffle sauce, crispy sage, pea shoots, stilton chunks, and more fried breadcrumbs) was excellent, but the truffle seemed overpowering initially. I don't know if I happened to get too much at once, or the flavour mellowed over time. I don't want to detract from this dish too much, because it was excellent. The beef cheek pie (beef cheeks, mixed with mushroom, anchovy, smoked champ with a layer of mash on top) was great. The pie crust was perfect the filling was fantastic but very rich. It took me a long time to eat this, not only because it was rich, but also quite big. However, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to finish it.\n\nDespite us both being full, we had to try at least one dessert and for our choice we got the trifle (custard, currant, saskatoon jam, sherry soaked cake, and fried breadcrumbs). This was another good dish and a nice finish to our meal.\n\nChef Lindsay has got a great menu here and I can't wait to try out some other amazing sounding dishes. However, we wondered if we chose the only 4 dishes on the menu with fried breadcrumbs, so we asked the waiter and we pretty much did, although he suggested that chef loves them. One final note, London Local does a 3 course Sunday roast for $30...that ought to be a winner.",

  "text": "I'm surprised by the number of interesting businesses that dot the Alberta Avenue neighborhood.  Popular bakery is exactly one of those.  Old school, been there, been renovated etc., this bakery carries the charm of an old neighborhood like none other. \n\nThey're a portuguese bakery and cafe, with reasonable amount of seating space and big glass windows that makes this place inviting and worth it.  The coffee is nothing great, I'll be honest, but then again if you want coffee that you're going to drink in Portugal, you better expect it not to be Italian.  What I would highly recommend is their single serving custard pies.  So freakin' delicious and goes great with a warm cup of latte.  \n\nThe bakery section looks nice but I haven't bought anything other than their ciabatta buns.  Those buns are creating quite a wave around in Edmonton.  Popularized by Drift Food truck who make great use of them in their sandwiches, these buns are so delicious and worth their price at 6 buns for $2.25.  Spongy, tasty and capable of holding a lot of material in it, these buns are certainly my favorite in Edmonton.\n\nI would love to come again and not only shop for buns but try some of their sandwiches etc.  I love how affordable this place is, yet is all neat and tidy.  I could totally picture myself doing work here, if my work warranted sitting on a laptop in a coffee shop (well, on some days it does).",

I tried the Pork Bahn Mi. I have to say that for some crazy reason this sandwich has become a major trend in most restaurants. The Bahn Mi at Twenty Tap is probably one of my favorites. I love how they serve it with dill pickles on the side and the french fries are perfect. I can't wait to go again and try the Poutine. The menu is varied so it offers something for everyone and is not over pretentious. They also offer Vegan options which I think are awesome. If you're looking for a new spot to try I suggest this one!!!",

Bucking the trend, had a grilled shrimp po boy on a bun and a boiled potato. The po boy was awesome, really flavorful and not overcooked.  The potato was kind of bland and didn't soak up much of the cajun seasoning, but I still liked it, though admittedly, I love potatoes and have rarely met one that I didn't like.  I also tried some of my sister's boiled crab legs and shrimp, which were delicious, but only  shrimp were really spicy.  \n\nI would be willing to eat any of these things again, but everything was so good that I'd be curious to also try every other menu item.

Of course I was hyped, more so because this was my first ever meal in New Orleans.  The shrimp itself was outstanding. I don't think I've ever had such fat, juicy mouthwatering shrimp in my life (drooling as I'm writing this review). All  the shrimps were gigantic as if they were on steroids. \n\nI had to look at the menu twice (or three times) to make sure $1.50 martini and Bloody Mary wasn't a typo. It wasn't!!! Not a big fan of either one, but I couldn't pass on such a deal. It was only my first meal in NOLA and I was already in love. Before I even ordered my food. \n\nCatfish fingers are literally meant to be eaten with fingers only. I tried to use a fork, and it just fell apart. And you have to hold it so lightly so you don't break it to pieces. It was delicious though not too special. Coconut beer shrimp was ok. Mr. B's BBQed shrimp was the winner, as expected, and I wish I'd ordered a full portion for myself, instead of sharing between me and one other person. I don't like messy food, meaning, having to peel and work for the food I eat, but I didn't mind working for this one at all. Licking the sauce off of my fingers was the best part. \n\nAlso, I am not ashamed to admit that I asked for the complimentary bread 4 times. So good!",

As quickly as we could order it, coffee was at the table. We debated a while, but both settled on pancakes. I went with my token choice of bacon in the cakes and added a poached egg. \n\nI'm going to start with the egg: 100% perfectly poached. The cakes...tasted weird. They didn't taste bad, but they wouldn't make me want to come back. \n\nAfter eating I saw some egg dishes come out with sides of bread and remembers the yelp reviews talking about homemade bread. I think your best bet here is probably eggs with bread. \n\nUnfortunately, we had great service but I can't award more than 3 stars based on those mediocre pancakes.

Otherwise, this would be a one star review. \n\nWe had a voucher (worth $24) because we were staying next door at the Nestle Inn. We each ordered the breakfast sandwiches on wheat bread and mochas. Choice of \"sides\" was vanilla yogurt or banana, so we ordered one of each. \n\nMy breakfast sandwich consisted of very dry wheat bread (butter? Please???), some kind of steamed (?) whipped egg patty filled with chopped ham, and some semi-melted cheddar. (The way the sandwich is described on the menu, I was imagining something closer to an Egg McMuffin, with a fried egg and a slice of ham.) Oh, and a whole, unpeeled and un-apeeling banana. Jean's breakfast was the same, except she had a little bowl of overly sweet vanilla yogurt. The mochas, while lovely to look at, were extremely sweet. The sweetness overwhelmed any other flavor in the drink. \n\nThe plate my breakfast was served on was chipped in three or four places. Seriously? I understand plates get chipped at restaurants, and I can overlook one or even two chips. But this plate was chipped on three of four sides (square plate). Tacky, even for a coffee shop. \n\nYes, the woman behind the counter was super friendly. She let us stand there for five minutes trying to decide what to order and was helpful explaining what was available for \"brunch\". If this was a review just for service it would be four or five stars. But it's for the food and the food AND coffee was not good. We won't be back.

I added the provided tomato as well. Also? I ordered sausage and potatoes and proceeded to pile those on as well, plus some of the salsa the potatoes came with. Win! \n\nThe potatoes are alright ($3 small, $4 large). They have some garlic and other items with them but I like my potatoes with more seasoning and increased browning. The sausage ($3) is a thick sausage , not your tiny link or patty. My friend got the black bean patty and portobello patty. Both are tasty! \n\nTip: thinking about the portobello sandwich? It's $8.50. Or just order the portobello patty for $3.50. It just means you don't get the bread and couple toppings, but heck of a deal!\n\nFinally, dessert...our lovely waiter asked if we wanted some pie. Sure! Chocolate peanut butter pie is the best!! But...sweet merciful Odin. It was $5 and a tiny slice. Very rich, ganache chocolate with some good whipped cream on the side. The problem? THIS IS NOT PIE. Sure, some pies are not fluffy or gooey, like Derby pie or pecan pie. But pies in general are gooey awesomeness - like apple, chocolate, coconut, etc. This \"pie\" is more of a cheesecake texture. I loved my visit, but honestly the fake pie was a huge downer. Where can I find homemade delicious pie in this city?!?!\n\nOtherwise, surprisingly reasonably priced for broad ripple and tasty.

I love the BYOF concept and stopped in at nearby Passariellos for a takeout order of their gourmet pizza and fries before I settled in at Kings Road. The brewery is pretty small, so if you're planning to eat dinner there and definitely need a table it may be a good idea to secure the table first and have someone from your party wait at the table while other grab food (or order delivery). However, if you do manage to snag a table they're plenty roomy and the brewery is well decorated and warm.\n\n I ended up getting a flight of beer which was reasonably priced at $10. I typically don't enjoy beer, but I was a huge fan of the Pawnee Chocolate Coffee stout (whether this beer is named after Pawnee, Indiana in Parks and Rec or is just a coincidence remains to be seen). This beer had a distinct coffee flavor that I haven't tasted in other coffee beers before. I tried a few others which were not particularly noteworthy but all in all it was a great experience. Kings Road is a great place to spend a chill evening with good food and drink!",

I don't really love shrimp, but I do adore Sid Booker's fried version. Large, plump, tender, and with a crisp batter that will make your arteries weep. We'd take our foil wrapped bundles home and have a little feast as if we were in Richmond with the family and not in Elkins Park. The ladies there are always kind, but they do a brisk business at certain times of day so don't expect a whole lot of chit chat.\n\nNote: This is take-out only and you're going to have to wait on the corner or in your car for a bit while they get your order ready. Contrary to El S.' review, I don't think you're likely to get taken down in a drive-by here as there are usually lots of folks. But like any denizen of a city, I wouldn't be hoppin' in the car for shrimp at 11pm if I wasn't a card-carrying member of that particular 'hood.",

From previous experience here, the one thing I'm not fond of are the spring rolls so I tend to stay away from that. \n\nI used to live literally a block and a half away from Numchok Wilai.

By the time we were ready for it, the churro had reheated perfectly and was as if it had come straight from the fryer. Not gonna lie, this churro was fantastic. It was crispy, chewy, well cooked and well sugared. The sauce was also very good. Next time I will branch out and try one of the fancier ones. Can't wait!",

  "text": "So what is a spaghetteria?  My vision is of a cafeteria that serves spaghetti.  Maybe you grab a tray and a bowl of spaghetti, then hold the bowl under a spigot that applies the sauce of your choice; red, white, meatball... plunk plunk.  A place you might take your grandma if you don't like her a lot.  Certainly never a date.  That's my vision - I'm glad to report the real restaurant is nothing like this.\n\nArrived with the family Friday night about 7 - no reservations required, but the place was maybe half full.  They are in and old building with a cool brick parking lot.   I would guess the history of this property was industrial.  The transformation to restaurant looks like it was done a while back...feels kind of like a Caleco's, early 90's.  Comfortable and casual.  We actually liked the ambience.  \n\nService was excellent and very friendly.   Food was good.  The wife  ordered the cannelloni special.  I thought it was pretty good, but there was some kind of spice in there she didn't really like.   I had \"Verone\" spaghetti, which had roasted garlic, chicken, spinach and sun-dried tomatoes.  Too much garlic for my taste, but I'm sure a garlic lover would be in heaven.   My daughter had a pepperoni pizza and it was really good (mozzarella and lots of it).  Unfortunately, the only size they could bring us was 12 inch so she needed about a fourth of it.   The leftovers made a great lunch a couple of days later. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable and, even though our food didn't blow us away, we really liked the place.  Portions were huge, pizza was great, it was apparent they care about quality and service was excellent.   This would be a great place to grab a pizza before a Cardinals or Blues game.

  "text": "I took last year off (I think? I don't remember going) from po-boy fest, so the last time I had been there before returning this year was the 2010 fest - this was when the lines really started getting crazy-insane. I'm not too claustrophobic, but even the 2010 lines made me a little queasy and panicky. \n\nFast forward to 2012 - I'm not sure whether all these changes were new to this year or in 2011, but I really appreciated that they did away with having a main stage right at Carrollton and Oak. Really seemed to cut down on the bottleneck at the very beginning. Also, the mobile beer vendors were excellent! Anytime I needed a beer, I never had to go more than half a block. \n\nI LOVED that Bike Easy provided free valet bicycle parking. What a fantastic service. There were even some nice guys who helped me out with a quick pro bono tire tuneup, which was much appreciated. I'm not sure how widely advertised the valet service was, since I saw tons of bikes locked up on fences around the fest. \n\nThere are still damn long lines and big crowds at Po-Boy Fest. If you truly get panicky around big lines or crowds, Po-Boy Fest is probably not for you. That said, I was in an epic long line (Jacques-Imos) that actually moved pretty fast. \n\nOne suggestion: I wish there were a few more sweets vendors. It was hard to find a way to satisfy my sweet tooth after chowing down on po-boys.\n\nI think this is one of my favorite festivals in New Orleans, but then I'm a glutton who loves excuses to eat anytime, anywhere.",

The pizzas are made fresh in front of you, and with the exception of the cheese and one-topping, they are all one price.  \n\nWhen you walk in you get to choose your pizza type, and if you build your own you get to advance to the toppings station which is mind blowing!  Tons of amazing, fresh meat and veggie toppings for every taste.  If i have lots of veggies available, I don't even need meat, and trust me, there are plenty to choose from!  You can also pick your sauce, and I recommend the spicy red sauce.  VERY spicy, but super flavorful and satisfying.  \n\nOnce built the pizzas are slung into a fire oven and they come out AMAZING AND HOT!  So crispy and perfectly cooked from crust to center.  They have lots of salads, and some desserts near the checkout to go with your pizza, and I assume they are personal sized (oh boy that's embarrassing if they're not), but they have boxes out for leftovers.  \n\nI went on Friday after work, and it was dead...I was the only customer there, but I bet they are slammed at lunch.  I can easily see this becoming a once-a-week staple for me.",

  "text": "We stopped by Sun King and thought we would check out the new Oca restaurant/shop inside. Oca, meaning \"Goose\", is a spin-off for Goose the Market that opened inside the public area of the brewery. Although they hadn't \"officially\" announced they were open, I had heard that they were open in the evenings and were working through a soft opening process. So glad we stopped by!\n\nMy wife and I both tried one of the bundled French Bread sandwiches. Tonight's featured City Ham and Gruyere with Dijon mustard, tarragon, and mini sweet pickles (cornichons). I placed our order at the counter, paid, and gave my name. They asked if I wanted the sandwiches toasted (yes!) and that allowed me time to pick up a couple drafts at the Sun King counter. As soon as I was making my way back to our table, the Oca staff called out my name and I was good to go. \n\nI loved the crispy crunch of the bread and the toasting brought out the flavors of the ham and cheese. Excellent pairing for the spices too. Can't wait to come back to try some of the sausages and charcuterie. \n\n*****update******\nI made it back one evening and decided to try the Choucrote Garnie which may as well translate to \"meat lover's dream!\"  Actually, it's a \"traditional dish of France's Alsace region bordering Germany\" and the Choucrote is fermented cabbage while the Garnie means it is dressed with Riesling (white wine), herbs, potatoes, and charcuterie.\n\n This huge option is brought out in a roasting pan.  My eyes started to glaze over at all the meats.  In the center was a large peppery Knack(wurst) nestled over a large serving of the Choucrote.  To the left was a thick (a full inch) smoked rib chop that was the most tender pork chop I've had.  In the upper left corner were two Nuremberg sausage (technically much larger at about 5 inches instead of the 9 cm traditional).  The Nuremberg have a thicker casing and more in the Bratwurst family.  To the right of the Knack were a couple slices of Pancetta that looked like American bacon, but have a higher salt content.  Just below that, there were two Strasbourg frankfurters.  Oh, and there were two potatoes that were halved and roasted.\n\nThe Choucrote itself was a great surprise at how much I enjoyed it.  My mother used to make a really nasty version of sauerkraut and dressed it with white vinegar.  I hated it!  But here, the pungent odor of vinegar is replaced by the pleasing notes of the Riesling.  The sour of the dish is tempered as well, so the overall taste is quite pleasing, especially since it is warm and served thoroughly tender. (I am not a fan of the sometimes rubbery and tough texture of raw cabbage.)\n\nThe portion size suggests it is for two to four people.  They mean it on this dish!  I made really great headway on devouring the dish, but common sense struck me before I was stuffed and decided to get a to go box.  Not for the picky eater, this is a dish that goes great with a dark beer (I went with the Sun King \"Stuck in the Middle\" Milk Stout option. Yum!)\n\n*****back to the original review*****\n\nAs if I didn't have enough reasons to stop by Sun King already, now I can get great quality sandwiches while there. Note that Oca sells packaged meats to take home if you stop by to fill your growler.\n\nTech stuff: They are open generally the same hours as the brewery.  Parking is free in the Sun King lot.  A number of platters are meant for 2 to 4 people, so bring friends!\n\nReview #439\nRev #30",

They prepare these with garlic and taste good. It's not a big plate and at a regular price of $6.95 , I would not have paid for them.\n\nI ate their Mango salsa Jerk chicken taco, served with black beans and white rice. I thought great sweat mango salsa will be a great balance to the spicey flavor that I love in good jerk. Instead what I got was all sweat. The \"jerk\" chicken tasted bland and not warm. Plus the taco shell had that not so crisp taste.\n\nMy son ordered the pizza from the adult menu, I thought , well worst case I can help hm finish or take part with me. Small portion for $12. Ok taste, nothing to go nuts about. My wife and daughter split a cheese burger that they ate, but said tasted ok.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed a bit with this place. I have eaten at the GB in Washington DC and we loved that place nd had expected similar here. I was let down, I'll give them maybe another try, but with so many options in NOLA, it maybe a while.",

In the evening it's dimly lit, has plenty of comfortable seating, and it's as much of a coffee shop as it is a Gealteria. \n\nOn my most recent visit I enjoyed some of their gelato on their adorable patio out back. They have cafe tables with a fountain in the middle and lights strung above. The patio feels like one of the best kept secrets of Tower Grove. It's a hidden little bungalow. It's getting a bit chilly so you might have to wait until spring to check it out. \n\nThe staff is all friendly and the patrons seem to primarily consist of students studying away for their next exams. This is a great place to go with a couple friends, a date night, or even just to study alone. 5/5 would recommend.",

The problem is they've got a great looking cafe and a great menu but their wait for to go is ridiculous. My wife and I were talking about it and we are almost certain that they make you wait an unnecessarily long time to get your dessert to just make the restaurant appear busier. \n\nWe stopped in and ordered two pieces of pie today. They were busy yes but we waited 20 minutes after we placed the order just to get the two pieces. In their display case one of the pies already had a slice cut and sitting there. I just don't understand this type of service. Yes I get it you are probably trying to keep your restaurant looking busy but it really makes us think twice about even going and messing with the wait just for a dessert. Again Cake Bake, you are good but you are not that good!\n\nIf they aren't intentionally creating a wait then they definitely have a major flaw in their to go order work flow because they literally have at least 12-15 employees working simultaneously on any given weekend.",

I normally go for Aussie wines because I know more about those but this place is breaking me out of my comfort zone and allowing me to confidently try some Canadian wines.\nHubby loves this place for the beer selection. Quirky beers from all over the world, some gimmicky bottles with dinosaurs or James Bond (that he can't resist). Sherbrooke Liquor also stocks cans of Tennants Lager, which is bog standard in Glasgow and a little taste of home for us.",

  "text": "Russell Gardens Center in Churchville, Bucks County, Pa., may not be the largest nursery garden plantation in the region, but in my estimation it is one of the best. I have been shopping here since moving to Bucks and starting a garden around the house (The enterprise is never done).  Originally, I was tipped off to its existence by a nurseryman friend who helped me with design and bare root tree planting.  He swore by Russell's for perennials and colorful annuals and shrubs that most other dealers either lacked, or only possessed in inferior quality.\n\nAs an example, twenty years ago I bought a small pot of Coreopsis, a hardy fern-like leafy base with yellow star flowers that bloom in late June/early July, and spread to fill any space they are in.  Yesterday, I returned to see what was new in this native American beauty.  Now, they are available in a few shades of red/orange, and most strikingly, in a red/yellow flower that is breathtaking in its simplicity and kinship to its elder cousin.  Love at first sight. It is now planted across the walkway from the original, and it is easy to imagine its growth over the coming years.  \n\nWe purchased 3 other low growing, shade loving varieties to replace the old builder's grade junipers that had run their course.  Three Heuchera with rich dark maroon/gray foliage, two Veronica (Speedwell) that push up spikes of pale blue to indigo flowers in early June, and three low dark green/purple grasses that spread through their roots to cover bare soil and need little maintenance. They are all happily in place beneath the living room window. \n\nAlways more work to do.  Plans call for a redo of the west side foundation plantings.  Russell Gardens will get the call as we lay out our plans.  Their inventory, knowledge and understanding of gardens and gardeners, makes it the place I trust most with suggestions and products. Prices are about the same as the other shops. \n\nRussell Gardens is why we dig in the earth.",

Although the place underwent a much needed face lift, I'm sorry to say that our dining experience overall was just fair.\n\nOur party of 5 arrived about 7 on a Sun. during Philly Beer Week.Found a table w/o a problem. Service was extremely slow. Was busy, but not crazy busy. Seemed a bit understaffed? The music was too loud at times; a pet peeve of mine. We're here to relax have some beers, a bite to eat, some conversation.\n\nThe food ranged from good to bad. The bacon grease popcorn was delicious and addicting.My 1/2 oyster/ shrimp po boy was tasty and authentic. The bread although toasted was a bit stale. The 3 shrimp and 3 oysters were nicely seasoned but small. The mac' n' cheese was standard. Served in a piping hot bowl topped w/ bread crumbs. It would have been better had it been creamier and more flavorful. I prefer a sharper cheese profile; like w/ some Romano? Filling, but not very satisfying. In New Orleans you can get a better po- boy at any dive bar for 2/3 of the price, but yes this is not NOLA. My mate loved his red beans & rice; his crawfish etoufee not so much.He thought the spices could have been cooked longer; to me it tasted like it just needed salt. His patrner got the muffuletta which she enjoyed,but could not finish. Our other friends got the ribs. Big mistake. They were huge, mostly bone. They complained that the meat was not tender- falling off the bone, and had an abundance of fat & gristle. When asked by our waiter how the food was, they told him and he gave a discount for the ribs. Nice gesture.\n\nGlad to see the beer selection is still great. They were featuring Perennial Ales that day/ night and my Saison was outstanding. There probably will be a next time for me here, just for beer & popcorn.",

Shrimp and grits was not on the menu so, consequently, my salivary glands were not stimulated. \n\nThe food was good but it wasn't slap ya' mama good (which is good in a way because if the food would have induced a slap to my mama she would've probably uppercut me). My mom and sister agreed that it was good but not slap ya' mama good. \n\nWe ordered fried calamari, crab deviled eggs, and mussells for apps. The calamari and mussells were excellent. The crab deviled eggs were interesting. Not bad at all but not something I would order again. My sister had the rainbow trout which she said was good but not great. Mom dukes had the lobster roll. The bread looked really tasty. She enjoyed the roll but I've definitely seen her more excited over $8 buffalo wings. I had porgy which was the special for the night. It was grilled. Absolutely loved the crispy grilled taste. It was also really juicy. The flavor could have been a bit bolder though. It fell short in the flavor categoy. For sides, we had spinach and asparagus which, of course, were good enough. You could even taste the grill flavor in the asparagus-mmm. \n\nOur waitress, the hostesses, and the rest of the staff were great. The restaurant itself, including the furniture, the outdoor area, and decoration is really simple but cute. I love the white/brown/beige color scheme. It's also huge inside but with an intimate feel.\n\nI have to try it out again.",

I like looking at all the cool clothes and treats. They are more pricey that your big box pet suppliers but, the experience is much more pleasant and the stock is much more varied and interesting. \nPet people are also more apt to drop some cash for our babies. \nBest of all, there are usually pets for adoption. This is a wonderful thing for these shops to do as a service to pets that would possibly be destroyed and to the communities where these stores are located. Bravo!",

  "text": "We visited Flyte for my birthday and had a really incredible experiences.  We told them that we were visiting for an occasion and they did such a great job making it a special meal, including bringing us champagne and some little brownies.  I love the whole 'flyte' idea, especially when it comes to wine.  I always want to try more than I should reasonably consume...so bringing me three small portions is an excellent idea.  I loved all of what we ordered, but the highlight for me was the lamb flyte.  It is a bit pricey, I'd say a special occasion type deal for sure.  \n\nI also thought that their temps were a bit off, ambiance wise.  Halfway through the meal I started burning up, where hubs was apparently under an air-vent and very cool and cozy.  I'm not sure what they can do about this...but it might be something to look into.  Also, forced-valet parking angers me.  You have a parking lot, I am a good parker, and I can also walk ten feet.  \n\nI am intrigued by their happy hour specials, however, so I may be lured back for that in the meantime.",

And there's really no reason not to pop in...after all, it's right in the center of town!\n\nIf you're a globe lover and collector like me, you're in serious luck. I found one from the 1950s for $25 that I desperately wanted, but since I'm in the process of clearing clutter ahead of my move back to Collingswood, I resisted. It was so hard! They also had a bunch of big ones in stock.\n\nRight now, they're selling banners depicting the PATCO stops. They're pricey at $59, but otherwise really cool. I would've loved to splurge on one, but again, stopped myself!\n\nIf you're looking to add some quirky or elegant items to your home, this is a good spot to look. I'll certainly be back for a serious browse session once I'm settled in my new place.",

  "text": "Pastaria is getting a well deserved update and I'm bumping them back up to 5 stars. Yes, there are a few things that I wish would change. But the bottom line is that they are darned good, family friendly, and now you can use the No Wait app to get in line before you go. \n\nI've been a handful of times since my other reviews. I love the bread - the oils and parmasan on the table are so yummy. The risotto balls are my favorite! The burrata is also very good. The canestri cacio e pepe is my favorite pasta. The wine list is also delicious. My husband, son and I enjoyed a great dinner here last night out on the patio area. It was warm but we had some shade from a tree, which helped a lot. They brought out my son's meal before ours (which they had asked if they should do and we said yes). He was happy. I wish the kids meals had a protein option other than meat sauce on spaghetti. Chicken or something. But not a huge deal. He loved his mac n cheese and also the risotto balls that we ordered. The meal took quite awhile to get to us, and when it was brought out, we were told that dessert was on them. We appreciated this a lot! We were not mad about it since our son was happy and occupied and we also had bread and an appetizer to fill us up in advance. Service was great. When we arrived, we were able to sit right down but when we left, the wait was 90 minutes. Come early to avoid the crowds! \n\nThe blackberry gelato and tiramisu we enjoyed due to the wait on our food were wonderful. We'll be back, Pastaria - you're back in my good graces.",

  "text": "Best biscuit I've ever had! This was on our list of places to try, we drove by the other location and the line was out the door - about 30-40 ppl deep! It had been raining all morning so wondering if people waited out the rain, so we decided to go to the this location instead. Worst part was the parking - there's a lot across the street but Biscuit Love was not a place listed for places the lot was allotted for. We didn't want to take chances as we've heard the meter maids are pretty diligent here. After 10 mins of circling, we found parking about 2 blocks behind the restaurant that allowed 2 hour parking.\n\nWe were prob 5th in line and it was raining - the staff was super nice and actually had in-house umbrellas in anticipation of lines. Took about 10 mins to get our order in and another 5-7 mins to get our food. We ordered the East Nasty and Wash Park. Wow - the biscuit was a heavenly pillow of fluffiness and not dry at all. Fried chicken thigh was good but not great but the gravy was delicious (could've used a bit more gravy). We also ordered the famous bonuts - soooo good! They're much bigger than the pictures depicted so I had half of one and was done. My bf wanted the Gertie (for you people with a sweet tooth - get it, it's ridiculous), one bite and I was dunzo, way too rich for my palate, but he was in chocolate/PB heaven. \n\nWe ended up taking 75% of the bonuts and Gertie to go. Gertie didn't re-eat well, really should be eaten warm but the bonuts were still really good later that day. Overall, this was prob one of my favorite places during our visit to Music City. If the fried chicken were a little bit better, this would've been a 5 star review. Now I ponder regrets of not getting the Nasty Princess - an off the menu item that is a combo of the East Nasty and the Princess....there's always next time.",

Prices are steep, be forewarned. I think some menu items were totally overpriced. I started off the evening with their Don Margarita, which was almost a house marg with fresh lime juice and Patron. Unlike many other margs I have had, I knew this one had alcohol in it. For dinner, I ordered the Mocajete Azteca. This was a pretty unqiue dish served on steaming hot volcanic rock. I love how all food is served very hot. They start you off with chips and pico, and the first round is free (they should really not charge for this at all given the prices of everything else.) My boyfriend had the enchiladas with chicken. Tangy and delicious. Our server, Christian was excellent. Another added bonus, this place has a parking lot. Which is so nice for Conshy.",

  "text": "I've been on a pizza kick the last couple weeks. I'm not sure why. I've always loved pizza but it's starting to become an addiction. I opened up yelp to see if I could try any new pizza places. I've heard of Fox Dens before but never had it. I check their website & saw a \"today's special\" for one large topping pizza for $7.99. I figured that would be something good to try. I called & ordered a pepperoni pizza. The pizza would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I made my way over after work. \n\nThis location is located off Elm Hill Pike in a strip mall. I've passed by this strip mall a million times but never noticed Fox Dens in it. I pulled up & walked inside. The shop is small, a couple tables are inside if you'd like to eat there. The woman didn't ask for my name over the phone, but it was 5:30 & I guess they didn't get a lot of call in ordered because she knew the pepperoni pizza was mine. I also noticed that they had a 100 score from the health department. That always makes me feel good. My total was $8.74 & I was on my way. \n\nThe weight of the pizza seemed a little light to me for a large. The box was big though. I waited to look at it when I got home. I opened the box and noticed how big it was. I'm not sure if the inchage (is that a word?) but they cut the large into ten pieces. I like that. It also makes me feel like a fatty because I ate 5 slices. \n\nI thought the pepperoni pizza was great for the $7.99 price. The crust and bottom had the right amount of crisp to it. I liked how the cheese was cooked golden brown. The amount of pepperoni was good, however I thought the amount of cheese was a little spare. Maybe next time I'll order with extra cheese. Was it the best ever? No. But I'm looking to try other pizzas they have. From the menu it looks like they've got some different signature pizzas.",

You've been on my \"must go\" list for months now, and when I finally get a chance to go, you let me down.\n\nI'm a sucker for good service, and the guy at the front of the house was the worst.  We had a reservation at 7:00 - granted, a busy time for any restaurant, but at the very least I expect to be acknowledged.  We were ignored with not so much as eye contact for a full 20 minutes.  During this time, he was taking delivery orders and instructed patrons on the other end of the line to \"make it quick, we're busy in here\".  We were very tempted to walk out!\n\nHost aside, the food was generally good and the service during dinner was solid.  My DP and I had the much-hyped dan dan noodles and they were hands down my favorite part of the meal.  If I lived close enough for delivery, I'd order just for these!  We also got the wontons in chili oil, which were disappointing.  The wontons were flimsy and bland and combined with the overkill on the oil, they were a big miss for me. \n\nThe garlic sauce style pork was pretty good, but there wasn't much to set it aside from generic Chinese takeout.  My DP got the shrimp in the crispy rice style, which I loved.  The rice had a satisfying crunch and the black and wood ear mushrooms were tasty.\n\nI will probably give HD another shot, but more than likely at another location.",

  "text": "Went there on a Saturday night with a group of 5 friends. Yes, it used to be a Taco Bell, but the inside looks nothing like that. It is clean, with only 8 tables total, this is a small place. Chef Ma and his team are very friendly! He came out to greet us as we were sitting down. He again came by to check in with us at the start of the meal. The best part was the end of the meal, we had a chat and he genuinely offered my friend an opportunity to go into the kitchen to learn some basic prep and knife skills and to learn a couple of  essential chinese dishes! What a gem!\nThere are 2 menus, the one printed in landscape form has Americanized Chinese dishes, but get the one printed in portrait form and it has the authentic Chinese dishes!\n\nTo start, we got the Hot Oil Juicy Chicken and Salt and Pepper Tofu. Keep in mind this is an appetizer, so the chicken is served cold, but it sure is moist and tender, it has chili oil and jalapeno peppers drizzled on, but if you brush it aside, it's not too spicy. The tofu was crisp on the outside and silken soft on the inside with savory, salt and pepper crumbs on top!\nFor entrees, we ordered a feast of Chef Ma's signature dishes: Lamb Stew, Fish Soup, stir fried lotus root, twice cooked pork and spicy clams. All of his signature dishes can be found as photos around the restaurant. My favorite was the claypot lamb stew which has bamboo shoots, chinese mushrooms, fork tender lamb, chinese leeks, in a rich meaty stock with ginger and sugar cane. The fish fillet soup was the next favorite with needle mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, chinese cabbage. Both broths were soul warming on a 10 degree night! The twice cooked pork was stirfried with stewed firm tofu, in a chili hot oil, but don't let that scare you, it imparts a smokey flavor to the pork with just a slight kick of spiciness at the end. One of our group is a vegetarian and the stirfried lotus root was perfect, tender lotus root with snap peas and chinese mushrooms, healthy and delicious. Now, the spiciest dish of the meal were the clams, but they were certainly very fresh, and perfectly cooked! \nChef Ma's style of Chinese cooking is rich but yet light, flavorful but not overpowering. \nWhat a feast! We love Chef Ma and his team! Our interaction with everyone there, together with our experience will certainly have us coming back many more times!",

  "text": "It's been a few years since we've visited the Hotel Congress.  A few years is too long to wait for a visit to this historic little place.  We were in town for a concert at the Rialto Theater next door and stayed at the Hotel Congress so that we would be within walking distance of the Theater and not have to fight traffic or ultra happy concert goers afterwards.  What a great plan!\n\nThe Hotel Congress is conveniently located in downtown Tucson right across from the old train depot.  Although parking at the hotel can be scarce, there is ample parking at the depot.  There is also a really nice restaurant in the depot that we will have to sample on our next visit.  We were also pleased to see the underpass under the railroad tracks has been remodeled and now it is quite convenient and safe to walk from the hotel to many of the bars and shops along 4th Ave.\n\nBefore the concert we stopped by the Tap Room, the hotel bar, and had a drink before the show.  The Tap Room is small, but nice.  A row of booths parallel the bar and a vintage juke box stands in the corner next to the door to the patio.  They had about half a dozen or so different selections of beer on tap, including Guinness and Four Peaks Kiltlifter.  If I remember correctly, the draft beers were $4 each.  They also had a pretty decent selection of vodka's and tequila's.  \n\nI really dig the antique switchboard and front desk.  They have cubby holes for each of the rooms and you actually get REAL keys here!  I give them an extra star for this factor alone.  Not only is it a novelty in this electronic day an age, but how many times have you walked back to your room on the morning you are checking out, only to find out your key card no longer works?  Then you get to walk all the way back to the front desk, have them reset the card, and then walk all the back to your room.  Well, you don't have to worry about that here!\n\nThe rooms are cozy (i.e. small) but very comfortable.  Each room has a closet, a bed, a dresser, a desk, and an end table with a rotary dial phone.  The shower in our room was small, only 3'X3'.  The water temperature was a little fussy, but I don't remember that from before, so we'll see if it's still acting up on our next visit.  The Hotel Congress has tried to stay very true to what it was back in the day.  It's nothing fancy, so don't expect a 5 star resort, but is wonderfully comfortable.  I've read some of the reviews and have to say that yes, I did hear the train at night, but it wasn't intrusive.  They do only have evaporative cooling, so you have to keep your window open a little in the summer.  We were quite comfortable with the cooling and the ceiling fan on during the night.  There is a nightclub downstairs and it gets pretty busy when school is in session.  But if you stay in the rooms not directly over the club, you won't hear the music or the people.  We've really fallen in love with the charm of the Hotel Congress.  When you walk through the doors you are instantly transported back in time.  We can't wait for our next visit back in time.  Oh yeah, ask the desk clerk about room #214. *wink*",

  "text": "Have an infatuation with Mexican food? Crave perfectly roasted chicken? Adore delicious cocktails? Love really amazing locally owned restos in crazy cool spaces? If you answered yes to any of the above, I have the perfect spot for you: Rostizado! \n\nThis roasted chicken-centric brain child, from the delightful men of Tres Carnales fame, have carved themselves out a neatly packaged niche in the Mercer Wear-house building. With smart, sexy cocktails (that do take a bit of time to arrive at your table, so be patient), and a truly unique menu (there is no guacamole and salsa here, this is grown-up Mexican with thought and flavour) that is unlike anything else in the Province. \n\nI love the decor, the chill couch-lounge with vintage red TVs. The staff is incredible (especially those sporting 'man-buns', wink, wink) and the stand-outs food wise, for me, the sandwiches for lunch! - either the rosti pollo or rosti puerco. Do get the rosti papas (best roasted potatoes EVER!) and roasted cauliflower as sides, so good! And I quite liked the roasted romain hearts salad. If you like mushrooms get the queso fundido. And of course, the roasted chicken! \n\nAs this is still a very new restaurant, there are bound to be bumps and bruises, and learning curves. That's why I gave it 4, not 5 (because I know it will improve, I can't wait, and my re-review a few months from now will show that!) And I urge you disregard quick-to-judge early reviewers that may \"loose their internet cool\" after minor meal mishaps that they may portray to look like Moby Dick size mistakes.",

  "text": "Loews Philadelphia gets all my stars and I don't think I had one complaint during my entire stay. All the staff was really accommodating. When we checked in, we were originally put in a double room and asked to instead be put in a queen - not a problem, not even a hint of attitude. We called guests services about 38947239 times to request more pillows (ended up with 15 total) and each time, the person at the other end of the phone was chipper, and even gracious to send up more pillows. And concierge was very sweet and helpful, directing us to a good brunch spot as well as doing some research for me on what places would be open during Labor day and offering some suggestions on how to spend the day. \n\nBeyond the staff, the hotel itself was super swanky and I liked the sleek and modern decor. The hotel is a converted bank and was really cool and trendy throughout. Everything was clean which is muy importante and my #1 qualifier with hotels, and our room was spacious with some nice pluses like super comfy robes that I couldn't get enough of, a decent blow dryer (not those shitty travel size ones that most hotels have) and lighted make-up mirror, PLUS two extra mirrors outside of the bathroom! I don't think people realize how much weight those extra mirrors hold. It wasn't the case in this instance, but if you ever have multiple girls in one hotel room, multiple mirrors are a lifesaver! Overall the room was great -- especially compared to the Marriott across the street. We were invited into a double room there for a short bit and the place was poop compared to the Loews. \n\nThe location was also a win. You are right in the center of everything (view from the top floor is amazing), and lots of the obligatory touristy stuff is within a short walking distance. Liberty Bell, Magic Gardens, Love Park, etc etc. are all withing a 10-20 min walk, and Reading Terminal market is pretty much steps outside the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and shopping too, so all your needs are covered in the close  vicinity. \n\nLike most reviewers have already mentioned, parking here is stupid expensive and we parked like a block away for 3nights/4days for a total of $51. \n\nOh and I thought of one complaint. The pool. Not that Philly is really a destination where one would typically think of relaxing by a pool, but this one was pretty lame. Its an indoor, two-lane lap pool, definitely not something to lounge at... and there is no hot tub :(  there is however a pretty good gym (or so it looked). \n\nAnyway, the Loews definitely gets my vote!",

I don't think I've ever had a latke, but it was tasty. Not too oily. The flavors will the butter, cream and scallion were perfect. \n\n*cranberry walnut & geneva & raclette grilled cheese (black truffle honey, local sunny duck egg) - Whew, I'm glad I shared this dish because it was very heavy. Extremely delicious but if I ate the entire grilled cheese myself, I'd definitely fall into a food coma. \n\n*indiana hot chicken wings (dried chiles & crystal sauce, bleu cheese dressing, carrot & celery slaw) - this was SERIOUS business. I've had seriously hot nashville chicken, but damn this was SO spicy. I loved it though!\n\nThe only thing I didn't love was the camellia drink I had (apple, matcha, pistachio and steamed milk). It was grainy from the pistachio maybe? and just an interesting but not that tasty combination of flavors. Also, a small cup was $6!!! Ridiculous.",

Finding the stores closed, we found the Study Hall alight with lanterns and flashlights.  In we went, cash in hand to purchase Guinness and Newcastle.  We sat together at the bar, regaling each other with past tales of glory from our misspent youth in Austin.  When news updates came on with where the fire currently burned, the bar went silent as though we were listening to the worst news that could be imagined.  In solidarity with our fellow alcoholics, we sipped silently.  The fire burned on.",

  "text": "I love Lilly's. It is my go-to Vietnamese spot uptown. But I have had a series of bad experiences and I think it may be time for a break.\n\nI know I usually go for lunch and they are always slammed, which is great for them, but I have gotten some really, *really* bad service. To tell you the truth, I can't tell if it's the lunch time rush or if it's personal or whatever. There is a server who is always there and I don't think she likes me very much. K asked if I ever gave a bad tip and I never did, so I don't know where it's coming from. Maybe I am reading too much into it, but she'll ignore me and go to greet other people or crack jokes and laugh with other customers while always looking at me with zero expression on her face.\n\nToday I wanted some pho but it was lunch time and I thought that picking it up and eating it at my desk might work out better for me time-wise. I called and ordered and was told that it would be ready in 25 minutes. I showed up in 23 minutes and walked up to the counter. For a good 10 minutes, no one greeted me or said anything, not even a \"someone will be with you shortly.\" I know they were busy, but the server had time to see people come in through the door and ask how many they were but she could not even acknowledge me and the other guy standing by the counter? Come on.\n\nFinally, Lilly came out of the kitchen and addressed us. Then it took an additional 5-10 minutes for the food to come out. It's like they didn't actually start preparing my pickup order until after I came in and spoke with Lilly, even though I called and was told a specific amount of time and I showed up with 2 minutes left on their time. What was the point of me calling ahead? If they had told me they were slammed and that ti would take 45 minutes instead (which is about how long it took), I would have made the informed decision to wait that long or go somewhere else. But don't tell me one thing and deliver another thing.\n\nYes, it's time for a break.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nUpdate:\n\nI received a message from Lilly herself with an apology. And my sister, who loves Lilly's even more than I do, came in town for Thanksgiving, so I went back with her at around 5 pm. Dinner time but not the busiest part. Oh. My. God. So much better.\n\nSo I changed my mind about the break. I will just try to get my cravings met when it's not lunch/dinner rush whenever possible.\n\nAlso, I tried the pork bahn mi for the first time and fell in love. The flavors are much more complex than a traditional bahn mi that you would get from say Dong Phuong.",

We were glad to get a very friendly waitress who was happy to get us soft pretzel sticks as an appetizer. They were warm and soft and served with three sauces. Mustard, a white warm cheese and a chipotle ranch. Yum! Then my son and I ordered the Saturday special which was a half rack of hot BBQ ribs and country fried chicken. We split this thankfully since it was a very large serving. The BBQ ribs were delicious and saucy. The chicken was breaded just right and it was very tasty. Our service was great the entire time with a very friendly server and a pretty nice atmosphere. They have sports TVs on every where with smart quotes on the walls for decoration. One of my favorite things was the seating. We loved that our table was lined up to sofas for the seats, cool and cozy idea :)",

I believe Crescent City Steaks was the original competitor to Chris' Steaks, which was eventually taken over by Ruth Fertel, hence the name \"Ruth's Chris.\"  The steak is good to incredible, depending on the night.

At our server's suggestion, we paid the slight upcharge to get the cinnamon raisin toast instead of white or wheat and it was worth every penny.  Homemade, full of plump raisins and lots of cinnamon sugar, it was heaven on a plate.  I also had what may have been the best biscuits of my life.  I ordered biscuits and gravy and while the gravy was delicious, I think the biscuits were so good they would have been fine all by themselves.  They were so buttery and really thick and dense, but somehow not too heavy.  I had a side of hash browns and they were fine. They were thickly shredded and well browned, but unseasoned.  A dash of salt and ketchup and they got the job done.  Our server was not unfriendly, but she did just enough.  We laughed when we asked for more napkins and she brought back one.  We are a spilling, sloppy family and had already cleaned up one mess.  So back she went for more napkins.  :-)  \n\nThe atmosphere is not upscale, but nicer than your average diner.  Our daughter loved hunting for all the roosters in the decor.  We found them on the walls, on a clock, on the bathroom doors, and even as purse hooks inside the bathroom stalls.  \n\nYum...I cannot wait to get back there and have another biscuit!",

Of course, the entire evening was absolutely wonderful. \n\nI'm the kind of person who checks out a menu before I go to a restaurant, and I typically know exactly what I'm going to order. At Vetri, you are presented with a menu of possibilities and asked simply to mention anything that you definitely do not want, or even that you definitely do want. Despite my Type A tendencies, I absolutely loved sitting back and letting the kitchen run the show. \n\nWe opted for the lesser of the two wine pairings, which was still very pricey. The pairings were spot on and every wine was terrific. I was impressed. I'm sure the higher-end pairing is mind blowing. \n\nCourse after course arrived during the evening, and everything was perfectly paced. I can't recall every single thing that I ate but every course was exciting. My favorites were the pastas, and there were lots of them. Another big standout for me was the antelope. I had no idea what to expect but I was really pumped to try something new. The meat was absolutely delicious - tender and lean and super flavorful. I was pretty full by the dessert course, and I'm not a huge sweets person anyway, so I mostly focused on my dessert wine, which was great. \n\nAs for a return visit, of course, I'd absolutely love one. However, with the cost for two topping out around the neighborhood of $600, it's going to be a while (or an unexpected financial windfall!) before it will happen again. Until then, I've got my memories!",

  "text": "Just as tasty as my 1st visit to Dewey's at the Webster Groves location.  I love that you can get your pizza split half red sauce, half white sauce (an olive oil blend).  This time we got the seasonal Italian-style for our red half and the Wild Mushroom for the white half.  The Wild Mushroom on cheese and olive oil was much better than I even expected.\n\nThe side salads are big enough to split between two people, especially if you're getting pizza as well.  We split a side of the House Salad and got the 17\" (middle size) pizza between 2 of us and had 2 slices left over for later.",

  "text": "Dear Peppermill, \nThank you for one of the greatest weekends of my life. About 20 of us showed up for a friends 30th birthday celebration. Your rooms were large, the suites we partied in were enormous. Three flat screen t.v.'s in one room? Your nuts! A bathtub the size of my house, and the biggest bathroom ever. Big comfortable beds helped me fall into a drunken sleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. \nWe went to the Cafe for every meal and were able to find something different and tasty on the menu each time. On the last day of our stay I visited the amazing swimming pool with the biggest (unnatural) waterfall I have ever seen. Also ate at the all you can drink Champagne buffet, and the food was surprisingly good. Most buffets blow in my book. Hope to come back here again when in the area. \nLove, Noel. \nP.S. Thank you for letting me get away with just about anything and letting me win some at the roulette table.",

  "text": "Barbara's Home Cooking is based out of a house, which makes it all that much more adorable to me.  Doesn't get any more homey than that.  While we were driving down we even drove right past it, mistaking it for just another house.  It's got the cutest little patio, with tables and chairs scattered about, and a homemade menu sign just propped on a table.  I love places like this.  We went around 12:30 on a Friday afternoon and this little place was bustling!  They clearly do pretty well here.  Our server was the lady who owns the place (Barbara?  I feel terrible I didn't catch her name) and she happily chatted with us while still making her time to mosey around the restaurant and take care of other patrons.  I really like the relaxed atmosphere, it feels like going to eat at a relative's house.\n\nAfter chewing down on the delicious warm rolls were served as soon as we sat down, I ordered the catfish as my entree, though I did give pause to consider the fried chicken and the pork chops.  Out of all the side options, I was very intrigued by the pineapple casserole and the sweet potato casserole, but I played it safe and picked collard greens and green beans instead.  \n\nMmm I need to go out of my way to eat more catfish.  Deliciously crispy and flaky on the outside, with the fish meat inside soft. My greens were on the bland side, but I nibbled at my fiancé's Mac and cheese side and it was delicious.  I simply  made the mistake of trying to be \"healthy\" and missed out on indulging properly.  Next time I'll try the casseroles.  Oh? And did I mention that this place has dessert?  Will have to update after I go back to stuff myself with some of their banana pudding!",

Decor is great, loved the beautiful plates that were on the table (even though they were cleared immediately). \n\nService was very disappointing. Our waiter took quite a while to come over to us at all. When he did, he took our wine order without giving us menus. By the time we got our wine and menus, we were starving. He was semi-present all night.\n\nFood was excellent. I had the butternut squash which was the best I've had. Entree was beef shortrib, which I could cut with a fork since it was so tender. For dessert I had the molten chocolate cake which was very good. Everyone else was happy with their food, but the only other thing I tried was the chicken dumplings, which were great.\n\nI'm not sure if I'd go back, because I definitely like Buddakan better for Asian fusion. It was a good, not great, experience overall.",

I've been to this location twice, and to another location once, but I've had some of the best burgers each time. This time I had The Ramsey. Not sure why it's named such, but I go to Nacho Libre for answers. \"The Ramsey is number one... The Ramsey's pimento cheese is number one... The Ramsey's bacon is number one...\"\n\nI loved this burger. The pimento cheese was creamy and flavorful, but didn't distract from the perfectly cooked burger. Throw a little local bacon in there and call it a southern burger like no other. I would come back for this burger again and again. \n\nMy only \"beef\" keeping Burger Up from getting 5 stars is the service. The waitstaff, though kind, is typically slow and unattentive.",

  "text": "Now that I've been here for a few concerts, it's time for a review. I can't give it 5 stars because it is an arena. I much prefer a smaller to medium size venue when I see live shows. Lucky for me that most of the bands I see play in the small to medium-sized venues. \n\nThere are occasions where I do have to venture into a large space to see some of my favorites though. \n\nThe shows I've been to here are Tool, A Perfect Circle, and most recently, Florence + The Machine. \n\nThe first thing to be said for this arena is the size of it. Yes... it's an arena so it's large. Most arenas are built for NBA teams or college basketball teams. I'm not sure of the exact reason this arena was built but it seems to have been built for the local hockey team and as a concert space. Since that seems to be the case, it's somewhere in between a medium and large arena space. I don't love it but it's okay when seeing larger acts.\n\nThis last experience here, I had to take advantage of the First Aid station. I was starting to get a headache. I went straight to Bridgestone's website, found where the First Aid room was with ease and went there to get an ibuprofen. Kudos to the arena for making it easy. \n\nIn closing, if you love smaller acts but they grow to support a venue like this and they play there... you'll have a good time I believe. Buy the tickets and go have fun.",

  "text": "August 23, 2014 Saturday - 5 PM VIP Ticket\n\nAtmosphere - 4.5 stars\nBeer - 4 stars\nService - 4 stars \n\nBackground - Thanks to Yelp I got to go to another amazing beer festival.  Thanks Michael T! \n \nSoup Box - They did not list the designated driver option at all on their website for ticket sales.  I would have loved for my wife to go but to pay for a full price ticket was pointless as she was not going to drink.  After I was there I did find out that there was an option to buy.  The other thing I did not like about the website was that they did not describe what the difference between a regular ticket and VIP was.\n\nAtmosphere - Peppermill's Tuscany Ballroom which is a huge ball room that was the home to the event this year.   Which I found made moving from one station to the next with ease even after the place filled up with all the participants.  The only thing I disliked was the darkness, it made picture taking of the beer cans difficult and to the point I just gave up.\n\nBeer - The can beer has really taken off for the craft beer industry.  The two biggest advantages of a can is that it prevents light from destroying the beer.  Yes light hurts the beer, just like our skin is affected, kills cells.  The other big thing is the distribution cost; beer cans are much lighter then glass.  For me I think that some cans are more artistic, the imagery is amazing.  21st Amendment Brewery is leading the way with their clever beer names with art to match.  My favorite is Brew Free! Or Die IPA.  http://21st-amendment.com/beers/brew-free/\n    There were several breweries listed on the website that were not in attendance.  I was disappointed as the breweries I did noticed missing from the activities were the ones that do not sell in the Reno area.  \n  The best part of the night was the accessibility of some of the brew masters.  It was great talking to them and hearing the pride they take in their work.\n\nService - Thanks to all the volunteers working the event helping some these small breweries pour the beers for us.\n\nYelp's Booth - That place was rocking with a steady group of people checking the stuff out!\n\nFuture - Beer and lots of choices that you cannot get in Reno, yes I will be back.",

  "text": "The Good- First off, I love cuban food. I usually stick with the cuban sandwich (El Cubano) which includes roasted pork, ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles. I usually get it el mini sized (smallest size) with the combo of a drink and a side (I either go with sweet plaintains or the black bean soup). The sandwich itself is delicious, with awesome salty pork flavor. Their plaintains can be hit or miss, as I sometimes get really mushy plaintains. Definitely enough to fill up on with the el mini combo.\n\nThe Pad- Right on the broad ripple strip which is nice if you are walking around or grabbing a bite to eat with friends. The eating area isn't particularly large but it was clean and I loved being able to sit at the bar in the front window. The employees are also very friendly and happy to have you come in!\n\nThe Ugly- A little one the pricey side for what you are getting in my opinion. ~$10 a sandwich is the only thing stopping me from coming here constantly.",

I've tried a good number of items on the menu.  I've finally figured out my favorite!\n\nThe sandwiches are where will get the extraordinary flavor. They mesh different flavors and they work pretty well. My favorite is the banh mi. It's not traditional by any means. It's a great fusion and I love it. I also ask for a side of Asian and Sweet barbecue sauce to dip it! I love dipping!! \n\nFar East is my second fave! It's with the Asian Bbq sauce. If u can't handle a little bit higher level of spicy. Ask for the kimchi on the side and test it out! \nI also tried the Conquistador, but that was the least favorite. If you like a sunny side egg on a sandwich that's your go to!\n\nFor their sides, their fries are the best! They are not too salty! Their mac and cheese is quite smokey(not my thing). Their corn on two occasions were good with the cheese, but overcooked & small kernels. If the kernels shrivel up, they r over cooked in my eyes. The fried okra is a close 2nd favorite but the ends r kinda hard. The potato is small. Half the size of your fist.\n\nIf You Are going to get brisket, get sliced so it can be moist. The chunks were dry and hard. The favorite meat of choice is pulled pork.\n\nI do want to try the wings which seem to be a special on Tuesdays. I also want to try their ribs! \n\nExcited to have a new non chain spot in Wesley Chapel! Thank you for being in town!",

We ordered the caesar salad and the lasagna, which holy smokes, that lasagna is something special. The caesar salad was good but the real star, the reason we will make Milk and Honey a usual spot will be that lasagna. We told our server and he said that it is a recipe from the chef's family. It was FANTASTIC! We loved it and could eat that, all day, every day!

  "text": "This was our second time staying at the St Louis Hilton Curio. Our first trip was back in March. We had a great time and fell in love with the hotel.\nThis trip left a lot to be desired.\nI will start off by saying that our room was \"wet\". Yes it was wet. The A/C was like an old swamp cooler. The humidity was over the top. Our bed felt wet. The floor was slick do to all the moisture. I ended up with an ear-ache due to the extreme cold moisture.\nThe second part that was frustrating, we stayed on the 3rd floor \"Grand Hall\" which means we are supposed to have access to the \"Concierge Lounge\". I looked all over and couldn't find the lounge. Saturday morning I decided to look again since we are supposed to be able to get breakfast there. I finally went down to the desk and asked about our free breakfast. He asked what room I was in and I told him 321. He said yes that we did get a free breakfast but it was in the main dining room and not in the \"Concierge Lounge\" as listed on their website and our reservation.\nWe received 2 complimentary drink tickets for their main bar but you can only use one per day? We went to a Cardinal's game Saturday evening. We were looking forward to coming back to the hotel and sitting in the big main hall where they do the light show on the ceiling and having a couple of drinks. When we walked into the hotel, that whole area was blocked off for a private party? That is one of the main reasons we chose this hotel. So I have 2 complimentary drink tickets that we couldn't use because we didn't have access to the area. We couldn't even go to the \"Concierge Lounge\". Wherever that may be.\nThe room is supposed to include bottles of water every day. That wasn't there.\nSaturday morning I asked the maid in the hall for some new towels since ours wouldn't dry out due to the crazy amount of moisture in the room. She gave us a set. I asked her if she wanted the wet towels and she said she would get them from our room when she cleaned it. They were still there when we got in later as she never cleaned our room.\nSome of the other things was a fire alarm that went off late Saturday night. The scary part was that the alarm didn't go off in our room. I heard it out in the hall. The alarm that is supposed to flash in our room never flashed. If I were a deaf person I would have never known the fire alarm went off.\nAll that to say that we were very disappointed in this stay.",

  "text": "This was my first time into this bakery, but my 3rd Time enjoying their treats. I had my annual red velvet cake from here 2018 and it was really good. It competes for my top three as I said I get it once a year. No nuts or coconuts. \n\nThis time though I purchased some holiday treats and a gift certificate. I tell you. While I'm sure many do it, I love the hand written certificate to get my sweet treat on. Too bad it was a gift. But at least the person that got it said their homemade granola bars $1.25 or $1.50 were her top favorite thing here. \n\n$3.50 for 4 butter cookies, not bad. My family loved them. Even our visitors of the night indulged and had such pleasant things to say. So I'm sure I'll be back. So while it isn't new it's new to me and it's my local bakery!\n\nEveryone there were helpful and kind. That just goes so far for me.",

  "text": "This is my favorite ice cream shop at St. Louis. This place is always crowded. It's open from 11am to 11:30pm. The shop is large enough to have enough room for ice cream made. The order can be placed and pick up from the outside of the shop. People can sit in their car or the bench to finish their ice cream. Drinking water is provided for who needs after finishing their ice cream. \nMy favorite ice cream is Hawaiian concrete. It's ice cream blend with banana, pineapple, and nut. It's so delicious. My daughter ordered Oreo concrete. It's also delicious. My husband and my son tried Hawaiian concrete also. They love it. \nWhen you walk up to the ordering station, there's 2 windows next to each other. The one on the left is usually for ordering. The lines are pretty long even at 11pm but it's totally worth it. There's a big menu located on the side of the building. Also, when you're ordering at the window there are mini menus there too!! 5 sizes are available. After you order, they will call your order out when it's ready to pick up at the window next to it. Usually, more than one set of windows are open so remember where you ordered. I love the ice cream here. It's delicious and a great treat on a hot summer day. I always come here whenever I go to St. Louis.",

Its not that I'm antisocial, it just doesn't give you much privacy to talk with the party you came with or you end up hearing the other party's conversation down to every detail. I'm not into that.\n\nI do love the atmosphere.  Its dark, woody, intimate with a lit up sign that says OVEN instead of OPEN.  :)",

  "text": "I came to Ashley Furniture store with one mission: to find a dining room table and a sectional! \n\nI came by myself, which was probably my first mistake. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman, if it's because I was alone, or if it's because I look a lot younger than 26 (oh PLEEEEASE let it be that one! Please!), but whenever I go furniture shopping, I get ignored completely. And that bugs the SHIT out of me. \n\nI moseyed in with that innocent \"hey, someone please help me\" look, and I managed to catch the eye of a few salespeople, who smiled politely, but then attended to the older couple that walked in together. Or the middle aged gentleman. Or the prada-wearing old lady who looked like she had money to spend. \n\nPffft. Fine. I didn't need anyone to hold my hand, anyway. I roamed the store and had no luck finding a sectional, but I did find a gorgeous dining room table that I had to have. \n\nJust like at Weekends Only, I had to track down a salesperson and practically beg them to help me. \n\nWhat was funny was that she seemed to know that I hadn't been greeted or helped, as she immediately apologized for the lack of attention before any words even left my mouth. Perhaps my pissed off look spoke volumes. I sure hope these fools don't work on commission. \n\nAnyway, I bought the dining room table. I was able to pick a date for delivery. A few days before the delivery date, the company called and gave me a time frame for arrival. \n\nOne thing I did like was that the furniture arrived already assembled. I do love assembling furniture, but it's nice to have that part completed already. I can't even imagine how long it would take me to assemble a dining room table and six chairs all by myself. \n\nThe quality of the furniture is top notch, so I'm happy about that. \n\nBut if there's one thing I can't stand, it's being ignored. Just because I'm young doesn't mean that I should be treated any differently than any other paying customer. Do better, Ashley Furniture (and furniture stores in general!)",

  "text": "I love Priya Hot Yoga and am officially hooked. While I've enjoyed yoga in the past, I've never felt so excited to go to class and felt so good afterwards.\n\nWhile I still don't have any other hot yoga classes to compare it to, I've now taken classes with several instructors and really have been enjoying my experience overall. \n\nA few weeks after the grand opening trial class, I came back and got the new client package. For $40, I get 30 days of unlimited yoga. It's been great because I've been able to practice with several of the instructors including Julia, Ashley and Liz.\n\nSeveral classes are offered each day and it's really easy to work them into my schedule. I love the fact that classes are offered at 6am on Tuesday and Thursday! \n\nAll of the instructors have been great and have had similar philosophies on yoga- they really encourage you to practice at your own level. The classes have been challenging but I've really been comfortable knowing my own limits and not fearing judgment. \n\nI'm especially enjoying the class with Julia and most of my visits to Priya have been with her as the instructor. I've found her classes to vary from week to week, but still have a consistency to them. I like that she offers corrections and pose variations without drawing from the class or overall flow. She's friendly and has a great sense of humor which makes the class even more enjoyable. And as much as the core work hurts at the time, I know I am getting a killer ab workout. \n\nEveryone at the studio is just so great and the environment is very welcoming. I'm also really finding myself liking the music they play and I'm definitely able to recognize some tunes. For example some Jack Johnson music was playing at class the other day. While it's not the music I'd traditionally think of for yoga, it adds an extra fun element to my experience. \n\nWith the winter months among us, the 95 degree heated room feels absolutely amazing. I've never felt more relaxed in Savasana in my life. \n\nLooking forward to many good times to come at Priya Hot Yoga.",

  "text": "Now listen here. What I love about 30th Street Station, and about Philadelphia in general, is that public transportation is not stigmatized the way it is in south Jersey. In this case, \"everybody's doing it\" is actually a great reason for you to do it, too. I've only recently started making use of public transportation, and 30th Street Station has made me into a believer. \n\nIt's architecturally (say it five times fast) stunning. It's wildly spacious and open, it almost feels like a museum. Food options are varied and good. Signage is clear and concise. Employees are helpful. Ticketing is easy. Getting a cab is even easier. \n\nOnce I hit 30th Street, I fall in love with this city all over again. Excitement starts building as soon as I hit Lindenwold, and culminates as I shuffle up the steps to this gorgeous homage to everything that is Philadelphia.",

  "text": "Listen. As healthy as we all try to be, there's nothing wrong with waking up on a Sunday morning craving a freshly-baked donut. It happens to me quite a bit (probably way more than it should), and when the feeling hits, Donut Drive-In is where I go. I can confidently say that they have the best donuts anywhere in St. Louis, hands down. \n\nHeads up, the parking lot is a little small and can be interesting to navigate if it's busy inside. That brings me to my next point, which is that the inside of Donut Drive-In is smaller than you can imagine. As in, if there are more than a handful of people inside you'll have to wait out the door small. Which is something I'll gladly do, but I would've liked knowing that before my first visit. Third note: bring cash. You won't need a lot... if you're buying for less than three or so people, five bucks should cover it. On my most recent visit I had a chocolate long John (oh my God, drool-worthy) and a vanila custard donut for a grand total of $1.89. I felt like I was stealing. \n\nThe donuts here just taste fresh and have the perfect texture and consistency... and I love seeing all the action behind the counter! The young girls that work the register are as sweet as can be, too. Just a wonderful, tiny, thriving local business. I'm a huge fan and there's a big chance you'll spot me if you stop in on a Sunday morning. Hooray for donuts!",

  "text": "This is our go-to pizza place!\n\nIs it a little expensive compared to the major chains? Yeah, definitely. But the flavor and quality of the ingredients blows every other pizza place in the area out of the water.\n\nWe usually have a pizza and the fusion salad, which is fantastic. Even if you don't like salad, you'll like this one. I love that they serve Annie's Green Goddess dressing with it, I hadn't even tried it before I had it at PF and now it's my absolute favorite. It's little things like not sticking to generic dressing that set this place apart, not to mention the gluten-free & vegan options so you don't have to rule out pizza for dinner if you're hanging out with friends who have different dietary restrictions.\n\nI've tried almost every pizza on the menu at this point, and I highly recommend them all. Just can't go wrong with any of them, but my personal favorite is the Big Kahuna.\n\nSo, even though this is the best option for pizza in Westchase, I have to go with four stars because the non-pizza items really just aren't that great apart from the salad, especially the wings. I love wings and have tried them a couple of times to be fair, and they were a bit dry and not at all flavorful.\n\nDelivery time is also a little long even when ordering during what shouldn't be a busy time. I much prefer going in and sitting down, the service is always quick and friendly, never had a bad experience.",

So much meat and fish of every shape, size and color.  All the \"regular\" stuff, like New Yorks, swordfish, jumbo shrimp, and kabobs, are great but they also have spectacular specialty items, such as Kobe beef filets and veal.\nObviously, everything else is just as wonderful like the fresh fruit and vegetable but I esp like their cheese and dessert counters.

The even have real foie gras and duck pate, which I also love, please don't hate me.\nBUT and this is a big BUTT everything is ridiculously expensive. We just paid $9 for spaghetti sauce! It's the best damn spaghetti sauce in a jar you've ever tasted, but $9? Good Golly!\nSo here is my advice. For a special meal consisting of a fine piece of meat and some foie gras, A.

It was my third time visiting Pythian as a whole, but I had never actually eaten a meal there. Upon arriving, the Nashville Hot Chicken was already on my radar. And let me tell you, the sandwich definitely lived up to my expectations. \n\nThe Nashville Hot Chicken consists of spicy fried chicken breast and pickles all on a sesame bun. I was afraid the sauce would be too spicy, but it was just the right amount of hot! I love pickles, so they were a nice touch. On the side I got one of the Dirty Flurrys! I'm a huge fan of the All-American beauty that is the McDonald's Oreo McFlurry, so I was up for a new twist on it. Not only did it have Oreo mixed inside of the ice cream, but there were chocolate cookie chunks on top! Loveeee. They also have Butterfinger and M&M Dirty Flurry options, which I'll also have to try.\n\nOverall, I'm a big fan on this place. I received my food quick and hot and I can't wait to try some of the other sandwiches and tots!",

Those 3 are my meals on weekends haha. I usually stick to my personal favorite the banana butter smoothie and the sobro açaí bowl. And love their immunity shots for when I'm under the weather.

  "text": "I eat at Newk's pretty regularly during the work week.  I LOVE the Newk's Q sandwich, and I usually get that along with soup.  It's a step up from other sandwich chains.\n\nThat said, this place gets super busy both on weekdays and with weekend post-church crowds.  There isn't good line/crowd control at the front, and parking fills up fast too.  I'd love to see them staff up for rush timing with more personnel at the register, and staff to keep up with turning over dirty tables.  You often have to wait for a table while you wait for your food.\n\n4-star food, would have a higher rating if they could keep tables clean and turning over, and maybe even expand to have more seating or organized registers/line direction.  For now, 3-stars A-OK.",

Living near Grant & Silverbell, I would visit at least 2/3 times a week for drinks and bar food.  I would get prompt service by a good looking waitress and be happy.\n\nI go this past Saturday and end up walking out after being ignored for 11 minutes. \n\nI have a $10 Groupon, so I try again this past Monday.  Food was so, so.  I give my unhappy waitress the Groupon and she upset stating that I have to spend a minimum of $20.  This is not a term of the Groupon Certificate.  \n\nLong story short, I end up purchasing an additional meal to go, just to use my Groupon.  Maybe I will give Rusty's another shot in 2012?",

I love both, I know plenty of people who have been involved with both, and both definitely have their strong points and imperfections. But when it comes down to it, City Paper is something that I tend to flip through, whereas I actually tend to stop and read a lot more things in PW. it really knows how to draw you in.\nI also feel that PW does a better job of sponsoring events. They were one of the major backers for this things like Popped Fest and realizePhiladelphia. and you can't go wrong with what they've done with Rittenhouse Square's Concerts in The Park series over the past few years.\nCity Paper does have the better entertainment section by far though.",

  "text": "Palace of Asia has been my favorite place for Indian food since my mother discovered it about six years ago. I live in Phoenix now and the choices for good Indian food are very limited, so whenever I'm back in town I make sure my mom and I go for a dinner. We went on a Wednesday and it turned out to be buffet night, which is perfect since we can get to try out new dishes. \n\nChicken Tikka Masala: excellent, one of the best I've had\nLamb Kadhai: very good, tender juicy lamb\nVegetable and Potli Samosas: awesome\nNavratan Korma: a new vegetable dish for me. loved it, blown away by it even.\nKashmiri Dum Aloo: potatoes filled with cheese in a cream sauce. You don't even have to ask if  these are amazing. you already know they are.\nMutter Panir: really good\nDaal Makhani: black beans and lentils in cream, I recommend if eating from buffet.\n\nDelicious, served hot Garlic Naan.\n\nThis tip may make you feel like an old person, but go a little early, like around 5:30-6pm.  The first round of buffet items are brought out around then for dinner, so you know they are fresh and untouched. \n\nI don't typically get dessert at an Indian restaurant, but since they offer it in the buffet I figured I'd give it a shot. I liked the Gulab Jaman (milk and cheese balls dipped in syrup), but not a must have next time. The rice pudding was ok, a little too runny for my liking.  \n\nOverall, one of my all time favorite Indian restaurants and one of my all time favorite south NJ restaurants.",

Also Port-a-potties sprinkled throughout neighborhood-much appreciated.\n\nEvent is free, but if you are able don't forget to take a canned food item or some cash to donate to the Community Food bank at the entrance! Great organization that can never have enough support. \n\nPups are welcome on leashes, our pup loves to go and show off her Christmas sweater.",

  "text": "In the old days[1], say back in halcyon '06, Flat Rock was the beer drinker's go-to in Manayunk. I'm not sure if their selection has decreased or if selections around them have increased, but I believe the new reigning champion is the Old Eagle. \n\nThe beer list here is pretty amazing. They have a wide range of interesting beers on tap, and a huge bottle selection. In fact, I was here during Philly Beer Week and sat next to Tom Kehoe, owner of Yards, as he tapped a firkin of Citra Pale Ale. We had an awesome conversation where he helped me calculate the ABV of the first beer I brewed on the back of a napkin![2]\n\nThere is also an interesting crowd here for Manayunk. The crowd definitely is on the young side.[3] But they are usually more let's say, restrained, than the usual phalanx of young partygoers who maraude through the neighborhood. Everyone is really chill and there because they love craft beer. So I'd say this is a win over all. \n\nBrunch is also good. [4] It can take awhile to come out, but the food is usually well prepared and tasty.\n\nSo if you have your sherpa and yeti and are ready for a trip up into the hills of Dear 'Ol Manyunk, I recommend Old Eagle. \n\n\n[1] Yes, I just used the phrase \"in the old days.\" While this is generally followed with sentiments requesting that these damn kids get off my lawn, I assure you I will refrain from making such a request. \n\n[2] True story, bro\n\n[3] Same kids who I wish to, but will not ask to, get off my lawn\n\n[4] Yes, I realize that I mention brunch in every review I write",

  "text": "Of the many highlights from our daughter's Santa Barbara Zoo wedding, our experience with Jen Nally stands out. You all know the potential stress of wedding planning whether or not you are a particular perfectionist or laid back... we encountered relatively few roadblocks, but eventually our minds locked onto Jen's florals as the one thing we didn't have to worry about.  It helped that we met and brainstormed with her in person, and saw that she is a genuinely caring person, one who takes delight in the small details of others, generous, cheerful,  observant, and truly excited about plants and flowers.  I guess our tastes agreed, or else maybe she just wasn't judgy or overbearing about imposing her preferences on us. She welcomed photographic examples and we shared a board on Pinterest.  Her proposal was very fair, detailed, and specific, and she was always responsive to our questions.  She gave us her log-in so we could peruse all the wholesale vase and votive options (you might be able to find a better price online, but make sure you are comparing apples to apples).  In one email, I may have sounded a little panicked about all the set-up I'd taken upon myself (this wasn't even a DIY wedding), and she volunteered her crew to lend a hand.\nOn the day of, our site was beset by unusual winds which caused us to lose some major decorative elements (draping, chandeliers, all candles).  Jen's survived -  her arch was staked with iron rods, but the tall aisle arrangements couldn't stay on their stands and had to be placed on the ground where they blew over, so I would suggest that they be wired to the end chairs if anyone encounters that problem.  Even the low centered, generously filled centerpieces would blow over, but they took a beating and still looked lovely.  Jen repurposed the flowers from the arch on the head table - fabulous!  I hope the photographers captured where she put those aisle pieces - I know they were placed somewhere because at the end of the evening, my completely unsentimental mother-in-law insisted on bringing one back to the hotel because it was too beautiful to leave behind.  \nI didn't know how Jen would capture the \"Romantic Bohemian Jungle\" theme in a succulent color palette, but she did it.  She found a specimen protea for Blakely's bouquet which must have weighed 10lbs. overall... but no worries, a tossing bouquet and loose flowers for misc. tables, hair, flower girls, and cake were included.  I wish I'd been more calm to have enjoyed them all that day, but the centerpieces I still have 9 days later, are still bringing me joy. \nSure it's great when things are delivered as promised, but I feel that Jen went beyond that with her pleasant attitude.  She was a ray of happiness during the set-up while the wind was making a shambles of my little details, and I heard that at one point she ran in search of the groom for photos. As a wedding planner for the first time in 31 years, I didn't anticipate the importance of the vendors' positive attitudes... this is the kind of person you want involved in your happy occasion.",

It melted very quickly, was very light (seemed very airy) and flavor was..meh. I was not impressed. Just lacked the creaminess of Jeremiah's or even DQ's.\n\nPrice was $4.25 plus tax, comparable to DQ. \n\nI think we may be back to try some of the different flavors they have but I'm still in search of that perfect sundae I remember from my childhood.",

They take something as comfortable as chicken and waffles and make their own version instead... duck and pecan sage waffles...heaven. Then there's the deviled eggs. They take a plain old deviled egg and turn it into pickled truffle deviled eggs which are so incredible that I figured out how to make my own version and serve them whenever I can.\n\nMy most recent trip to Supplier was for brunch and I was yet again super impressed. First they make one of the best bloody marys I've ever had. I stuck with the original but they had many versions with Bourbon and tequila! Next I had the dixie biscuit which was great. It was a biscuit, with scrambled egg, pimento cheese, country ham and grits. YUM! My boyfriend had the supper benny which was also fantastic and I don't generally love eggs Benedict. \n\nTo sum up, Supper is a restaurant you can go to get a consistently great meal in Philly. It has an amazing feel, great atmosphere and very good food!",

  "text": "I've not made it a secret that I love deep dish pizza, and specifically, Giordano's. I'm still extremely bitter that Dayton has one and Cincinnati still doesn't, but I guess that doesn't matter much for the Indianapolis review. Their pizza is consistently cheesy and delicious. However, this Indy location needs a bit of work.\n\nI felt kind of bad because my friend isn't a big fan of deep dish but I REALLY wanted Giordano's. I rationalized that she picked dinner the night before and it was my turn. She agreed, but looking back she may have chosen a better lunch option.\n\nWe came in to a well air conditioned restaurant, which is absolutely crucial in this heat. I. AM. DYING. Anyway, we took a seat and were aptly greeted by our server. She wasn't exactly unfriendly, but a bit difficult to find. I have a feeling she wasn't a kid person because the two tables next to us had children and I watched the interactions she had with them. It was awkward.\n\nGiordano's has an excellent lunch menu. For under $10, you can receive a personal pizza, pasta, or sandwich with a side and drink. I ordered the sausage deep dish with fries and my friend had the thin crust cheese with fries.\n\nThe food took a surprising amount of time to come out. They say to allow 45 minutes for the deep dish to cook. I thought that meant full size pizzas, not the mini ones. I never asked if my pizza was the reason for our extended wait time, but I assumed it was a good bet because my friend's thin crust was ice cold and our fries were limp and bland. Her food could not be enjoyed without a hearty addition of ranch. Luckily my pizza was hot and filling because I left a good portion of my fries on the table.\n\nThe saving grace for Giordano's is the ability to buy frozen pizzas and take them home in their insulated bags. I took a sausage and a spinach pizza home to Cincinnati safely and enjoyed them in the comfort of my house. \n\nI've never hesitated visiting a Giordano's, but I'd probably think twice about coming to this location. It's smack dab in the middle of multiple A+ lunch offerings, so if you really want the deep dish, maybe eat elsewhere and get some of their frozen pizza to go.",

It's in the Marigny, which is definitely my favorite place to watch a parade. \n\nSo, no surprise here that you're going to see the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other science fiction characters that MAY, I ain't gonna lie, have gone over my head. But if you're a fan of such things, you will adore it. There are throws, sure, not of the quality and quantity of the big parades, and some of them are adult-oriented (I got some pills, lol), other things like roses and toys. The party in the Marigny surrounding this parade is also not to be missed. You can tell the folks in this parade are diehards and put a lot of time into their costumes and floats. Nothing like certain other krewes where some masked members just want to be dicks and throw bags of beads at people's heads. Here we've got nice, creative people just coming together to celebrate their nerdly love for sci fi (I'm a nerd too, I don't judge) in a parade is a wonderful thing to witness.\n\nPro Tip: Catch it on St. Claude for better viewing, or if you prefer to be amongst the partying crowd around Franklin, that's a great option, too.",

  "text": "Lobster Haven Shanty and Market needs to rename themselves Lobster HEAVEN because this place is phenomenal for seafood lovers! This place looks and feels like a little Maine lobster shack -- not too fancy on the outside, but incredibly delicious food on the inside.\n\nLobster Haven is located in a non-descript little strip mall along W. Hillsborough Avenue in Oldsmar. You'll find the restaurant / seafood market in between the shopping center with the Super Target (Montague Street) and the shopping center with the Lowes, Publix, and Cracker Barrel (Race Track Road). It's best to use your GPS the first time you visit as you can easily sail by without spotting the sign.\n\nI remember this store from years ago when they were in a small standalone building directly across the street from the Oldsmar Flea Market. They've now moved south just a bit, and set up shop at this new location.\n\nLobster Haven is both a seafood market as well as a seafood restaurant, and it is a great place to find fresh shellfish and seafood in the NW corner of Hillsborough County. You'll find live Maine lobsters, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, crawfish, and crab (Dungeness, Snow, King, and Stone). Sometimes they also have blue crabs and garlic crabs, but you should call ahead to double check. You'll also find fresh and frozen seafood ready to toss on the grill. The lobster is flown in LIVE from Maine, and you can walk over to the tanks to see the happy little crustaceans scrambling around for your viewing pleasure.\n\nNow in addition to that, Lobster Haven is an outstanding little seafood restaurant with Lobster and Clam Chowda (New England style, of course!), crab cakes, smoked fish spread, shrimp cocktail, shrimp baskets, peel 'n eat shrimp, Ahi tuna, scallops, salmon, fish tacos.........and then we have the lobster...... *insert choirs of singing angels here*\n\nYou'll find lobster rolls made with huge chunks of lobster meat in a top-split bun, lobster (or crab) wraps, Lazy Man Lobster (hand picked lobster meat spread out on top of crackers), and then you've got your choice of 4 different styles of Lobster Haven Shanty Buckets o' Lobster with ever-increasing amounts of shellfish to go along with your freshly-steamed lobster, ear of corn, seasoned red potatoes, and a fluffy Parker House roll.\n\nNow by freshly-steamed lobster, I mean that the guy came out of the kitchen, picked the lobster out of the tank, walked it back into the kitchen, and a bit later out came my Bucket of Steamed Shellfish.\n\nI had the Silver Bucket which was a steamed 1 1/2 pound Maine lobster, Middle neck clams, sautéed Black Mussels, Steamed Shrimp and Crawfish along with the corn, potatoes, and a roll. I forced myself to start the meal with a cup of their amazing lobster chowder which had big chunks of potatoes and lobster in a thick & creamy New England style stock.\n\nYou can buy everything live and take it home to cook it, or you can kick back with a nice cold beer and let them do the work for you. Make it a point to go visit these folks soon!!!",

  "text": "Anthro is definitely one of my all time favorite stores EVER! Their entire collection of home decor, accessories, candles and clothes is so thoughtfully curated with a certain bohemian-esque, naturally chic, trendy, yet classic aesthetic. \n\nThis location also carries bridal! And oh my goodness it is all so gorgeous! I adored my wedding dress but dang, I wish they had their BHLDN label available back then! Every dress is super romantic and feminine. They also have bridal lingere, swimsuits, veils, shoes and headbands. I always find myself drifting to this section when I'm shopping here. They politely ask me if I need help and I get embarrassed as I'm an old wifey at this point and quickly walk away with flushed cheeks. Brides, run here!\n\nI truly cherish every piece I purchase here. All so unique and definitely more special pieces versus run of the mill department store items that everyone will have. You just feel a little extra special wearing something form Anthro. I still have the 1st dress I ever purchased here and that was for the first wedding I attended with my husband, then BF 10 years ago! I'm definitely not one to hold onto clothes that long, but I still love it as much as the day I bought it. \n\nAnthro has also been know to collaborate with designers from all over the world! They partnered up with one of my favorites Mara Hoffman. You never what's around the corner....\n\nTheir housewares are possibly my favorite! Ordinary items absolutely beautifully designed. Kitchen Goods, planters, candles, linen napkins, throw pillows, comforters. It's all so lovely! Anything from here makes a truly lovely gift. In fact, I hit Anthro up every holiday season! \n\nPrices can be a bit much but really, quality is key. \n\nCustomer service is top notch. You will be greeted the second you walk through the door. They will start fitting rooms for you so you don't have to carry your goods around. They communicate via walkie and will contact someone on another floor to help you find what you're looking for. They also offer personal shopping! \n\nAs a former visual merchandiser for years I can certainly appreciate not only the ever changing amazing window displays, but the carefully merchandised products, as well as the seasonal displays! They are on top of everything! I mean I most recently visited on a Sunday then two days later and everything was fresh and re-merchandised. \n\nThis building alone is absolutely STUNNING! For those who remember way back to the 90's this was the flagship location of Urban Outfitters, who is a sister to Anthro. I used to sneak down here in middle school and blow my entire allowance on one awesome item! From the entrance to the decorated elevator, to the spiral staircase, to the faux fireplaces, hanging mobile and stained glass Tiffany-esque rotunda! Wow! That space alone is worthy of a visit. Being situated across from beautiful Rittenhouse Square Park isn't too shabby either! If you're from out of town and have never been to this gorgeous location, I highly recommend it!\n\nAnthro, along with Free People, Urban Outfitters, BHLDN, and Terrain are all owned by the same company which goes by URBN. Their headquarters are right here in Philly! I absolutely LOVE this! In the last few years they moved offices from Columbus Blvd to a beautiful space in the Naval Yard. Their company is very laid back, allowing their employees to even bring along pups to work! So cool! I can certainly get behind a company like that!\n\n*If they don't have something you're looking for in stock they will ship it to your house free of charge. \n\n*Sign up for their emails. They run great sales around the holidays and their catalogs make for great coffee table browsing material.",

  "text": "I am a huge fan of CVS. There is rarely a time when I can walk out without spending $50. I used to live in Margate, NJ across the street from the CVS there and in the summer there is no way the line isn't 10 deep. But I was content to wait everytime because they always had at least 2 or 3 registers open with all associates helping someone. \n\nLast week I went into this CVS for the first time only to buy paper towels and toilet paper (The good/expensive kinds were on sale). I was very unhappy to see that there was a line around 12 people deep and instead of just ringing people up and also having the self check out available, the store associate was handling technical problems in the self check out lines. \n\nFirst, there was only one worker available and there were so many issues with the self checkout system that if the regular register was open, it would have taken about 1/3 of the time to get everyone checked out! \n\nI was very unhappy with this system and already have my own issues about self checkout taking away important jobs in the community. I obviously will be going back to CVS, I love their rewards program and all my favorite hygiene products are in one place, but I will protest self checkouts forever! Or until we develop jobs to replace those lost by technology!",

  "text": "Stuck between a 2 and a 3 on this one, but I am going to go ahead and give it a 2 based on the fact that it was one of the strangest dining experiences I've had. My hubby (Adam) and I were in town for the day visiting our friends. We were doing a pub crawl with them starting off at the bar next door, so we all decided to come here. I was very impressed when we walked in. The restaurant was so big, and I thought it was very unique looking. The food has to be awesome, right? My friend and I ordered the cotton candy limeade, and it was delish! The food prices were overly reasonable. I was in love (besides for the weird waiter)! I couldn't wait for the food. Right off the bat though.. our server was pretty arrogant. I think maybe he got his training at DIck's Last Resort next door lol. Adam and I ordered their Sicilian cheese bread with pepperonis as an appetizer and decided to split the spaghetti and meatsauce as our meal (which comes with a salad). The cheese bread came out with no pepperonis... we ate it anyway and it was okay. Nothing special. I told the waiter about the pepperonis when he asked how everything was, and he joked that he ate them. Anyway, the salads weren't great. We had asked our waiter what their most popular dressing is, and he said the Pesto one. It tasted like watered down Caesar. At this point, I still had high hopes for the spaghetti. How could a spaghetti factory screw up spaghetti?! I don't even  know, but they did. There was only a small amount of sauce (which was super bland), and a tiny amount of meat. Luckily, I had saved some of the marinara sauce from the pepperoni-less cheese bread and poured it over the spaghetti which made it better. After we finished our meals, Adam asked for the checks since we had the pub crawl to go to. The waiter said he would go get them. I told Adam that our meal was suppose to come with ice-cream, so when the guy came back with our checks we asked him for the ice-cream. He was shocked and surprised that we wanted ice-cream... Now in his defense, we did ask for the checks. However, it was a really odd reaction and I doubt (even if we didn't ask for checks) that we would have been given the ice-cream if we didn't ask for it.",

As for slow service, the only reason it would be slow is if it's busy.  And, btw, this is a CB in case to missed the first mention; they are generally always busy and for good reason.\n\nIf some of these reviews saying this place has slow service..  I would venture to say you should probably be at a McDonalds drive thru to be in and out.  Honestly.  Now there are some unacceptable instances I'm certain now and again, but with a little common sense, one can distinguish if something's not right or if it simply is because the capacity reached in the restaurant. \n\nAnyways. Visit for yourself, don't take my word for it and if you find something not up to par, give them a chance to fix it.  These guys and gals aim to please and will within their best resources.",

  "text": "Situated in the neighborhood of West Tampa, otherwise known as Little Havana, West Tampa Sandwich shop is such a well known institution in the Tampa Cuban community that politicians from both major parties have used it for photo ops trying to sway the Latin vote. On their website you'll see pictures of Florida Governor Scott as well as President Obama. Inside the very casual restaurant you will see pictures of local politicians, celebrities, sports heroes, and hundreds of photos of patrons from over the many years the restaurant has been open.\n\nThe interior is not large and the parking outside just adequate for the number of seats inside. The décor is befitting a sandwich shop but with a homey feeling that makes you feel like you're in a place of importance to the Cuban community.\n\nThe food is very good and extremely reasonable. The main thing that drew me in was that they claim to have the best Cuban coffee in Tampa. Now I have not been to every Cuban or Latin restaurant in Tampa, although I've been to several, but I will say this is the best café Cubano I have had anywhere.\n\nBeing a lover of empanadas I had to try West Tampa's, ordering their Empanada de Picadillo. It came to the table blazingly hot, right from the fryer and was delicious, chalk full of savory picadillo stuffing. I have been disappointed in the past with Cuban style empanadas, preferring either Puerto Rican or Columbian style, but this was really good.\n\nAlong with empanada I ordered the cuban sandwich and was disappointed when it showed up with very little roast pork and mostly sliced ham. I thought it tasted very good for what it was but I guess when you have been eating them for your entire life and live in the heart of Tampa's Latin community it missed the mark. Still one of the better that I have tried though.\n\nOverall I thought the coffee lived up to the hype and was really wonderful and the food in general very good. I will definitely be back. Best of all the prices are very reasonable. With all the food I ordered, including a potato ball, the bill was only $12.",

First, the seating was quick, even though the restaurant was fairly full. It was Me, wife and 5 kids. We tried a variety of items as Kids love to try new items. Wife and I have visited Taiwan many times And we love the street food there. We had : onion pancake, oyster omelette, beef wrapped pancake, crispy pork roll, sweet sausage fried rice, house chow fun, salt pepper pork, braised beef noodle soup, sweet orange pork ribs, basil century egg and Taiwanese style Clams. Total Bill was $120.00 before tip. The food was really good. The Orange Ribs were as sweet as candy. All 5 kids commented too sweet. The Century eggs were very salty, but good flavor. We would eat every dish, other than the orange ribs again. \n\nSo why the 2 Star? Portion size. I was amazed at how little was given for the price. $13 for tiny ribs that barely gave each member of our family 2 tidbits. Thats about $3 for the length of my finger. The oyster omelet had 4 oysters in it. That's like $2 per oyster. We had to cut them in half. Not one dish was over 1/2 full. The clams were delicious, but again not even 1/3 of the bowl full. We left after spending $120 and kids were still hungry.  \n\nSo if portion is not an issue, eat here. Over priced, small portions, but delicious.",

We went tonight on a Friday night and were relieved that there wasn't a long wait for the food or for a table. I ordered beef pad thai and my husband got the red curry rice dish. I like that Thai 202 is a cafe-style restaurant and after ordering at the front counter, we got our own cups for water, our own utensils, napkins, etc before sitting down. \n \nIt's a great place to people-watch and our food arrived within 10 minutes in fancy boat plates. My pad thai was delicious and tangy, although the sauce was a little too \"sweet and sour\" for me; I'm used to a more authentic taste. The beef, though, was really tough and chewy...I was sad that I was unable to find a single piece of beef that was tender. Still, I enjoyed the noodles a lot. My husband's red curry was spicy with lots of fresh red peppers, green beans, and chicken. My tongue was still burning 5 minutes later after drinking a whole glass of water and eating my pad thai in an effort to diffuse the spiciness on my tastebuds. If you like spice, you will love the red curry. It went well with the white rice that came with it and we had enough sauce left over to bring home afterwards (we plan to eat it with more rice tomorrow!). \n\nFast, friendly service and a good place to get my Thai food cravings satisfied! Next time I probably won't order a dish with beef in it though...",

What more do you need? \n\nTheir seafood salad is loaded with seafood and the crab dip is a little bit more creamy than I would like it but the crab is delicious. \nThe caesar salad here is made next to your table, for caesar salad lovers this is a must!\n\nI personally think this is one of the best spaghetti in the city, way better than Little Nonna's or other places \"known\" for their spaghetti. I love their venison mafalde as well. I wish there was more \"sauce\" but the amount of meat they give you is plentiful and the pasta here is always cooked al dente, as it should be.\n\nThe tiramisu here is one of my favorites. The combination of the chocolate and the fluffy creaminess is sooo delicious. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.\n\nDefinitely worth it for the restaurant week deal, a date night or dinner with a big group of friends but definitely make a reservation!",

  "text": "I was just here this past weekend by chance.  I finished eating dinner at Fountain Square and went walking.  Happened across New Day and walked in.  I quickly recognized why I had heard of this before and it is because of the Johnny Chapman Cider which I don't really care for.\n\nThat being said, this place was great.  It is smaller, with enough room for about 10 at the stand up bar, and another 12 or so spread across the couches.  The place is very modern and sheik and has a limited menu in terms of food.  Snacks are a better description.  The real reason to come here is the 3 ciders and 3 meads they have on tap.  Personally, I love ciders but these ciders aren't for me.  They are all far to dry like wine rather than beer or cider.\n\nThe meads on the other hand.   I'm in love.  They taste like a Lambic, but have 8% ABV!!  So imagine the fruity delicious flavor of a lambic but with 4 times the alcohol. :)\n\nCant decide? They offer a flight of all 6 options.  They can also mix them together into \"cocktails\" with the incorporation of bitters and aromatics.\n\nI would come back here again.  It was a good experience for me.",

Anytime I find that they are where I am visiting, I have to go there almost every day and then buy a bunch of cold brew to come home with me.\n\nI first discovered them in SoHo in NYC and loved their delicious coffee in a no-nonsense style. They don't do almond or soy here because they believe in the integrity of the original latte, cappuccino or what have you. I like this.\n\nIn my almost week long excursion out in Philliy, I was able to visit all of their three locations. I even met one of the co-owners and boasted that I had visited all the locations at the time (they had a few in NYC, all the ones in Philly, and one in Chicago ...) only to find out that they had just opened a location in ... Seoul. Yes. Korea. \n\nWot?\n\nWell ... at least I can finally say I have been to ALL the La Colombes in North America! The co-owner is also a huge skater and owns his own skating company so I got an awesome skateboard deck out of it. Love this place!",

  "text": "It's been a while since I've tried somewhere new, so with a friend moving to Chicago, this was the perfect occasion.  We decided on Compere Lapin, Nina Lacompe's new restaurant.  Chef Lacompte is a recent runner up of Top Chef.  Her background and influence is mostly Caribbean, so I was excited to try what I thought would be some interesting flavors.  \n\nI wasn't disappointed.\n\nAtmosphere: A-\nI loved the atmosphere.  Rich browns, interesting lighting, exposed brick.  Had a prohibition era type feel to it.  I did find it to get pretty loud at times.  They should probably invest in some cushioning underneath the tables.\n\nService: B+\nThis is a tough one to rate.  This is a new restaurant, and they're trying really hard to make you feel welcome, and give good service.  The problem?  They're trying just a little too hard.  3 different people came to our table 4 separate times to see how we were doing.  This is in addition to the standard times where our waiter inquired when dropping things off or picking things up from our table.  It was just too much, and felt overbearing.  It seemed to occur each time we got deep into conversation.  If they could just simmah down some with this, I could give an A on service.  Our server Chris was really nice, and gave a great suggestion for an appetizer to share.\n\nDrinks:  A\nThere is a great selection of craft cocktails if that's your jam.  The prices range from $10-$14.  I don't remember the name of the drink my friend ordered, but I tried it, and it was very tasty!  I was in the mood for some summer bubbly, so I ordered a cava rose.  It was very good.\n\nFood:  A-\nThe food was really good.  You're started off with 2 small homemade biscuits with honey, chive, and bacon butter.  ZOMG!  Sooo yummy!  After our waiter saw how much we loved (and devoured them), he promptly brought us more!  At the suggestion of our waiter, we started off sharing the smoked tuna tartare. It was fresh and delicious, and a perfect amount for sharing.  We decided to share two entrees.  We ordered the crawfish pasta and the curried goat with gnocchi.  The crawfish pasta was good, but it wasn't great.  I really prefer a cream type sauce with my pasta.  It had a good amount of spice, was flavorful, and it was cooked right, it just wasn't something I'd order again.  My friend really liked it.  Now the curried goat was fantastic.  I'm a sucker for curry, and this was no exception.  Tender goat in a flavorful gravy with homemade gnocchi and topped with tomatoes and cilantro.  I was slopping that up with mah biscuit.  For dessert, the kitchen sent out a surprise complimentary dessert of horchatta panna cotta with berry sorbet over a graham cracker crust and all topped with an assortment of melon balls.  It was light and flavorful, and the perfect end to a biscuit, pasta, and gnocchi meal.\n\nValue:  B+\nThis place isn't cheap, but I didn't expect it to be either.  I'm ok with higher prices if you're putting out quality food, which they are.  My only complaint was that the entree portion sizes were a tad on the small size.  Had I not had the biscuits, and shared an appetizer, I'm not sure the entree would've been sufficient, and I find it safe to say that it wouldn't have been sufficient for a man.\n\nI would absolutely recommend Compere Lapin for it's lovely atmosphere, and tasty food...especially if you're into curry.  That goat...",

It was great getting a view of the workers and guessing as to what they were making.  The food was very unusual--Israeli meets southern.  We started with the whipped feta with honey and herb dip with grilled pita.  I ordered the bbq lamb topped biscuits and hubby ordered breakfast chorizo sausage burrito.  The feta was to die for and the entrees were both good.  Service was impeccable.  The only reason I dropped a star was because the lamb bbq could've been fresher and the outdoor patio area, although a lovely space, seemed unkempt.  They could do so much more with this area by adding fresh plantings and organizing it a bit by having nicer furniture, it seemed a blend that didn't match the interior.  Cleaning up the dead plants in the window boxes, doing some landscaping and picking up the miscellaneous items on the deck area.  Don't let the front facade or the location fool you, the food was very good and the atmosphere was hip and trendy.",

The view from the 2nd floor looking down on both the kitchen & the busy street corner was great for former cook slash tourist enjoying that beautiful spring day.  \n\nI was easy amused by the menu for the colas, as \nBaileys offers a large variety of locally made beverages.  We ordered the Million Dollar Orange made with real cane sugar from just across the river in Illinois. We also tried a cold one from Fitz's root beer bottled in St. Louis (my favorite this meal) & and a cold long time Classic Coke a in a bottle from Mexico.\n\nThe food was fun, and tasted as good as it looked.  \nThey have a wide variety of unique toppings paired with different ingredients making for some great burger combinations.  The toppings range from guacamole to Camembert cheese. They offer pretzel & gluten free buns.  A few things that peeked my taste bud's intrest were Fontina cheese, the pablano sour cream, the tomato jam and a few other ingredients.   \n\nI like the option to build your own burger or substitute pork, chicken, bison, lamb or a veggie burger instead of beef on your burger.  I was kinda surprised they didn't have a turkey burger option though. House made ketchup, nice touch\n\nService was great. Our server was very helpful & I love it when a server is knowledgeable of the menu.  Last but not least.... the house made pickles were addictive. Zesty pickles with a little bit of heat, definitely one of a kind.  My taste buds will hold that memory tight for years \n\nThe cons\n\nThe burgers were a little small for 8-10 dollars.  Which is fine, I enjoyed every bite. We were so full and hopped up on all the sugar from the pop we didn't have any room to explore the shake menu.\n\nWe really enjoyed our lunch at Baileys and we all agreed that if we lived in town this would not have been our only visit.  We were so into the burger battle my son & I decided to have our own. I got the Carolina with pulled pork, coleslaw and BBQ sauce.  He got the ABC Burger with roasted (A)pples, (B)acon & (C)amembert cheese.  So be sure to check out my photos & vote for your favorite.",

Could work in a few changes to coordinate not seating a family with baby and highchair squished next to an over sized group, creating a bottleneck for servers to squeeze through. Though they were flexible and accommodating to accept our request to change booths, and remained friendly and professional. Thank you to our server for that (I wish I could remember her name.) FOOD: Zac had the Mexican skillet which he said was pretty good, just noted the guacamole was heavy on garlic. Baby had oatmeal with bananas and raisins, which was a bit bland, so we requested a bit of cinnamon to sprinkle on top and she loved it. I had the veggie omelet with hashbrowns and pancakes on the side. I'd definitely recommend this dish.",

Very filling at an average price point. Not too bad!\n\nA perfect mix of the flavors with a perfect amount of udon noodles and lettuce and all the other stuff they put in each bite. I was pretty impressed how mixed it was. Loved the asian flavors. Plus the tofu \"chik'n\" is awesome. Like another yelper said, it doesn't make me miss chicken... (For this meal.)\n\nAlso got a groothie-- another popular item I saw on yelp and had to try. Pretty good and another filling item for my dinner.\n\nI wish their website had nutritional information, though. Definitely will be back to try other stuff.",

  "text": "If you love the casino life, you will probably love the Peppermill. I am not a fan by any stretch, so for me, everything looks gaudy and over-designed and looks like it would've been luxurious in the 80s, but not in 2016. Or like the designer is Donald Trump's interior designer. I'm in the Tuscany Tower. When the furniture is lush, the walls (not wallpaper, not paint, but texturized walls) AND fixtures, AND bedding, AND lamps, AND everything in eyesight does not need to be lush, too. Too too much, and not at all contemporary. I get that the theme is Italy. I've been to Italy. It doesn't look like this.\n\nThe casino furniture also looks like it hasn't been updated since the 80s. That said, nothing is in disrepair. Everything is functional. When I got to my room, I was actually about to call down to the front desk to see if I was in the right room, because I have two TVs (one in the bathroom), two sinks in the bathroom, two shower heads in the shower, and a jacuzzi tub for two. Apparently, all rooms are similar. Some others on this trip with me noted that they have a jacuzzi SPA that could accommodate four in the MIDDLE of their room. This is very 80s, Peppermill! No one thinks that's cool anymore. Well, no one outside of the casino life and under 50, anyway.\n\nI was surprised that the rooms didn't come with refrigerator or microwave. It's a resort, so I understand that they make their money on incidentals. So they have a mini fridge and snack bar in each room to keep you from bringing in your own stuff. Further, as a resort, all of the restaurants are grossly overpriced. Again, you're paying for the convenience of having everything right here. And it seems a lot of the food is the same regardless of where you're eating, especially the desserts.\n\nOnce my eyes recovered from bleeding and my wallet stopped screaming, I can say that the Peppermill is very accommodating. The fitness center is more than adequate, complete with numerous treadmills, elliptical trainers, free weights, weight machines, a studio for calisthenics, a steam room... and they give free bottled water.\n\nAll of the staff is super nice and accommodating from front desk to housekeeping to the many restaurants. They understand service.\n\nIf you want to get married, they even have two wedding chapels here. Gotta love Nevada.",

  "text": "I know it's not a 5 star restaurant, but you can't go wrong with Dot's Diner. It's cheap, it's filling, and it's comfort food. Plus, there's hardly any wait! (Funny story: as my husband and I arrived at Dot's Diner were IMMEDIATELY seated, I get a pop-up notification from Yelp telling me to check out the Ruby Slipper, current wait time: 45 minutes!!!! hahahaha, heck no! I'll take immediate seating & classic, cheap breakfast fare over a 45 minute wait for more expensive, smaller portions, and fewer options). \n\nI got the Big Dot because I couldn't make up my mind on what to eat, like usual. It's two eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 sausage patties, 2 pancakes, hash browns, grits, and toast. My hubby got the western omelet and added corned beef to his side of hashbrowns because he was torn between the omelet and the corned beef hash. The portions were huge, and have of me is ashamed to admit we scarfed down the whole thing and promptly napped for 2 hours after (the other half of me is SUPER proud). \n\nMy only complaint was that one of my eggs was still raw (a good portion was clear and runny, but our waitress apologized profusely and took it back to toss it on the grill for another minute. Usually, I might be upset, but considering the fact that our food came out less than 10 minutes after we ordered AND they were packed, I knew it was just a quick oversight, and it was super easy to cook it for a few more seconds, no harm no foul.\n\nMy absolute favorite part though is that they NEVER let your coffee cup get empty. As a person whose blood type is actually 95% coffee, I greatly appreciate this fact. That, and the waitresses always call you \"sugar\" and \"honey\" and I just love that Southern charm, its warm and endearing and I wish it was still around more down here!",

Once I stopped eating chicken though, I sadly, had no reason to return. I'm just not a huge fan of their salads. I recall thinking they were bland and \"nothing special\". I'd say Eats American Grill is a great place to go for a low- key dinner or place to watch sports. The waitresses are nice here as well! It's a small restaurant but I've never had to wait to sit and the parking lot is also small, but I've never had a problem finding a spot. enjoy! xo",

The only downside is the small space that they have. I know they have a backyard patio which isn't a bad addition to their space but it would be a lot nicer to have other spaces to sit. I've heard a big hub bub about their sweet potato fries but I must say that I was very underwhelmed...the fries were soggy and seemed like they were a day old. I will say that their sweet potato hash was really good and the sandwich I've gotten which has maple bacon and avocados were also very appetizing. Coffee is good but what kind of coffee isn't good besides the overly burnt ones I suppose! Overall, it's a good brunch place if you don't mind waiting and get any of their egg dishes or sweet potato hash. Maybe I'll give the sweet potato fries another time but for the time being, it was a bit disappointing.",

The fan base is small, but strong and vocal. The games are energetic enough to be very enjoyable and the minor leaguers aren't above dropping the gloves.

Not only was the food exceptional, but so was the service. \n\nEvery item we ordered was delicious. The brisket was a little fatty, but still extremely flavorful. The ribs had the perfect crust on them and the wings were big with a generous seasoning of garlic parm on them. My guest really enjoyed her sandwich and the candied yams. She also ordered mad and cheese which was very tasty! We were given 3 different bottles of their BBQ sauce and they were all very good, my favorite was the Kansas City. \n\nThe service was so great. Our waitress was very nice and kept checking on us. Additionally, someone who I think was the owner came over and greeted us, as well as clearing away some of our plates on his way out. Even upon walking in, many customers who looked like regulars greeted us, and one held the door for us on the way out. \n\nAs we were about to leave, our waitress told us that every night the entire bar takes a shot at 1911, and poured us both a shot of complimentary Bacardi. Everyone in the restaurant cheersed and drank the shot, it was so nice!\n\nPrices were also very reasonable for the quality and amount of food. Such a great experience here, would love to come back.",

I got the sweet and sticky which did not disappoint. My burger, however, did. I asked for it to be cooked medium with chips. I had asked our server if when they say chips if they're british chips similiar to fries (think fish and chips) and he said yes. When it came out, I was given fried potato chips. I politely asked for the waffle fries and apologized and they were nice about swapping them out. We didn't start into our burger until the fries were brought out and then I noticed that my burger was cooked well-done and was partially burned. At that point, I didn't want to call the server back over since I had already sent back my fries and there was a possibility of some irate line cook wanting to spit on my food. So I sucked it up and vowed not to eat there again...unless I want wings with my beer.\n\nGood points : they have craft beers, a happy hour and trivia night",

I was really excited by the interior decor. It's nothing flashy but has a tropical feel and reminded me of a lot of the Latin diners in Houston. The food is pretty good. We ordered the ropa vieja with the rice and beans as well as a beef pastelito (empanada), ceviche de camaron (shrimp) and flan. \n\nThe ropa vieja was super! The juice/sauce was delicious and drenched the white rice so nicely. LOVED that they had the el Yucateca sauce at the table! In my opinion one of the best bottled spicy salsas out there so you BEST know I drenched my meal in it. Put some on the pastelito as well and did not disappoint. Also loved their mango water btw! Order some aguas frescas to feel refreshed and get some sugar in there. \n\nThe ceviche was kind of disappointing, not going to lie. It felt over seasoned with salt. It didn't look the most aesthetically pleasing either. Please come here for the more meaty and rice options! The flan I was also not as thrilled by. It had a bit of an odd packaged flavor to it but you know I still ate the whole thing. \n\nCome have a nice cheap and filling meal. Will feel very hearty!",

  "text": "STOP!   Think twice and don't believe the hype... If you say you are great you better be, if you screw up - own it.  SAVE YOUR $$$\n\nThe crux of the issue with Vetri was that they ran out of the good stuff and because we were the late seating, got the vegetarian selection. FAIL! \n\nIt was a weird experience, and it is hard not to give them the benefit of the doubt when the reviews are so solid, but I need to speak the truth. First the reservation was for the wrong day and this might have been a simple mistake. We were told it would be 45 minutes and of course it became 85. They did compensate a bit and put out an excellent cured meat selection and vegetables with reduced balsamic. This was a nice beginning and the high point. \n\nHere is my 6 course chef tasting (FYI I said don't hold back, I eat anything) \n1... Tomato salad - it was tasty, lightly dressed with a nice mix of vegetables (I don't think this was even on the menu) \n2... Sweet Onion Crepe with White Truffle - this was excellent and the truffle around it was a great mix \n3... Almond Tortellini with Truffle Sauce - fresh pasta, amazingly unique \n4.... Heirloom Tomato Risotto - another vegetable dish that was just not that interesting and certainly not worth the calories.  Most of the plates went back. I think they saw this as a sign. \n\nAT THIS POINT I WAS NERVOUS 4 out 6 tastings done and not a single protein. And the final dish was... \n\n5... Dry Aged Ribeye - it was fine, but definitely the least exotic and boring entree. And in a city with some of the best steakhouses in the world, I would have considered this for an entree. \n\nAt this point we saw some serious scurrying going on in the kitchen and they brought out 2 dishes to share. I'm assuming this was what they had left. \n... Baby Goat with freshly stone milled polenta - This was excellent.  I never thought I'd like Goat, now I love those cute little animals.\n... Bass - it was OK (not sure where this was on the menu) \n\nDINNER DONE - FAIL \nOn the menu was lobster, whole fish, octopus, sweetbreads, quail, duck... Talk about the ultimate bait and switch, we were served none of it. \n\n6... Desserts was another sorry story of \"We ran out of chocolate.\"  What?  On a price fixe?  Am I allowed to say I ran out of money?  They were nice enough to give us a tasting, but there were no stand outs. \n\nAnother disappointment was that the entire table did the Grand Wine Tasting, so we hoped this would push the food over the top. The wines were excellent- tons of refills, the problem was they were selected for a bad boring tasting. \n\nService was the high point and our waitress was as good as we have had. My suggestion for them is if you see a dinner going south, stop it. Be intuitive enough to intervene and flexible enough to make your customers happy, this is what the best restaurants do. They should have explained the problem, not charged us a premium for a boring and lazy menu. At a top Italian restaurant our same meal would have cost a quarter of the check without wine. And there would have been more food to eat and we would have chosen better. \n\nI feel bad saying, but this was the worst chef tasting I have ever had and the cost for a mainly vegetarian meal was crazy. They ran out of food... I ran out of stars, suck it up, don't rest on your reviews and own it. \n\nTIP: Consider not going on a Saturday night, as Chef Vetri is not working. \nTIP 2: Pick exactly what you want from the menu \n\nI welcome anyone from Vetri to respond to this review and explain what happened and why I had the world's most expensive almost vegetarian meal.",

Weeks before my vacation, I had found this place on Yelp and was looking forward to visiting, but after what happened, I think this place may have been my downfall.\n\nI know that sounds super dramatic, but just hear me out. I visited District Donuts on Saturday (05/27/17) with my family. We each got a donut and one slider. I got a classic cheeseburger slider and a chocolate glazed donut. My mom and my sister also got cheeseburger sliders, but different donuts. I really enjoyed my slider in that moment, it tasted nice, but I will admit, it was quite greasy. The donut was also pretty good but could be considered a bit rich. \n\nAnyway, long story short, later that afternoon, I got, very, very sick. I believe that District Donuts was the culprit. I didn't want to believe it, but after reading some other reviews about the chefs not wearing gloves when handling the meat, I am not convinced this is where I got my food poisoning. I had to stay in bed all of Sunday because of it. I literally don't know what else could have made me this sick since this was my only meal that day. (I skipped Breakfast)",

I drove a friend up to Vandy for an appointment and decided to have an early lunch here. Finding the place was a little bit difficult because it is BEHIND the ace hardware store in the same parking lot. There wasn't a sign indicating it was there. Parked in front at about 11am. \n\nLocation looked like it used to be a car garage. Windows were tagged with the name of the business. I thought it was kind of cool. Went in and the place definitely was much larger on the inside. The decor is eclectic and urban. Had a chill atmosphere kinda like just a place to hang out and eat good food. I had to ask where the menu was and it's high up on the ceiling on chalk boards above the door.  Also told him that it was hard to find and it would be useful to have a bigger sign. One of the guys said that they were having one done and should be up soon. I mentioned that they should have one of the area's graffiti artists to make a sign for them to fit in with the decor. He kinda chuckled but i think he was just humoring me. The kitchen was in the open and everyone seemed to be busy. There was a variety of cold salads that all looked good and healthy. All the ingredients are organic and fresh. They were cooking on an free standing electric grill but they recently moved and it just fits in somehow. It reminded me of a large island cabana roadside food cafe. And EVERYONE knows that those things have the BEST food!! Anyways....\n\nThe menu items had some crazy names but i think it tied in to the atmosphere well. They had a lot of items to choose from and they all looked good. I chose a turkey, bacon wrap with hummus, avocado and of course a plate of the kale salad! My friend chose the ruban sandwich and we sat down at one of the tables. I looked around a bit while we waited due to the only ones in there at the time. They have lounge couches and an area for a open mike poetry or local band. The garage doors looked like they would open up during the summer months and be kinda like a great place to just chill and have a beer. There wasn't a theme, it was just random and trippy. I loved it. They just picked furniture that they liked. I am a bit of a eclectic myself and i was comfortable. The place was clean!! I don't know why ppl gave such bad reviews. \n\nThe food was AMAZING. They are not skimpy on the portions either. Most organic places give you a tiny plate that looks too pretty to eat. This place is no joke. It's like an urban free birds ( texas ppl you know what I'm talking about!!) If you're OCD about themes and matching things. And focus on the decor more than the food then you should probably not go there. I could only eat half the wrap and it was fresh!! The humus in it was amazing and the turkey tasted like they had prepared the bird. The bacon was crisp and yummy. The avocado was fresh and the pickle on the side was just crazy good. I could eat a jar of those things. My friend could only eat half of his reuben too. But he said that it was really good as well. One of the best one's he's had. \nThe kale salad was A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!! I have a love/hate relationship with kale. It's really good for you but i hate the taste of it. The salad had fruit and nuts in it, beans and a citrus dressing!! OMG!! I could of ate a bucket of that stuff. \nHalf way through eating, people started flooding through the door about 12pm. It was a very popular place for lunch and you had a huge variety of people there. Just random people with no theme looking for a great place to eat!! I will def be back to this place when I'm around that area. It's pretty close to the highway too. I left full but not stuffed, light and not heavy. Great place with amazing food! If you want to think outside of the box, take off your shoes and chill for a bit and experience amazing organic food, i encourage you to go here.  I will def. be back! :) Great place!!",

I liked the bee sting the most with its ginger flavor, but really wanna try the peppercorn one our waitress told us about in her going-over-the-menu spiel (which was MUCH appreciated, having never been here before).\nCan't wait to go back again when I'm in the neighborhood!\nAlso- it's BYOF (food), and there's outdoor seating.

The bread was fresh and accompanied by a delicious butter as well as crab spread.  This location does offer Happy Hour, but only for patrons that sit in the bar.  If I return to this city, I'd love to visit this Fleming's location again.  Great job, Fleming's!",

For so long the food was terrible, but about a year ago or so the food improved so much that we loved to eat there. It was delicious for quite awhile. Now I don't know what has happened, but the food quality has once again gone way down. Many fried things are burnt to a crisp. The 5 types of wings were not good at all. They were over cooked and dry. The sauces were not even flavorful. Once again, what they offer is not worth the price.// This morning we came for the breakfast buffet and I have to give it 5 stars!! The breakfast buffet has everything you could ask for.  Biscuits and gravy, toast and chip beef gravy, corn beef hash, scrambled eggs, all types of Dixon's to put in your scrambled eggs, a lady that makes omelettes to order, taters, taters with cheese, Mexican food, fried chicken, bacon, sausage links and patties, fresh fruit, milk-White and chocolate, fruit juices, salads, desserts, banana nut bread, and more!

  "text": "For dimsum outside of Center City's Chinatown...AWESOME!\n\nThis is closer to my house then driving to center city, and I truly can appreciate that. It seats a decent amount of people (~50) and although I've only gone on weekends at lunch time, the place is pretty packed all the time. The patrons are mainly chinese, and you'll hear the chinese chatter around you all the time mixed with some english. The servers pushing the dim sum cart speak limited english but there is always the art of pointing or calling over the owner/manager who speaks english well. \n\nThis is the type of establishment that only gives you tea, and water upon request. Service is fast and efficient, and the food served is hot and fresh. The dimsum they have is an OK selection, I've been to ones that have worse and better, but for what they do serve, I believe the quality is pretty good, esp since this strip of asian businesses is located in a unusual place in northeast philly. \n\nThe parking is always kinda rough, but I've never had to look for more than 10 mins before something popped up. Other than that, the standard noodle dishes are traditional and not fakey american. I love dry (no gravy) chicken chow fun. They do a good job here on the noodles in general, probably have tried 5 different varieties and never been disappointed.\n\nDef somewhere to check out if you live nearby and dont like going to the city for some authentic chinese food/dim sum. It's cured some of my homecooked cravings from my childhood while living away from home, so I will continue to be a patron.",

  "text": "Penang is a Malaysian place in Chinatown, and part of a chain.\n\nThe decor was unusual, there were metal fixtures in the ceiling serving a purely ornamental function. The restaurant was divided into two sections, a ground floor and slightly elevated platform. I had a window seat with a lovely view (of the street - this is Philadelphia, after all).\n\nService (Ha) was attentive, they came by to check to see if we had ordered and filled our water glasses repeatedly. The wait staff was ever-present, delivered food quickly, didn't mind taking pictures, and even walked over when I gave a thumbs-up sign (which was surprising).\n\nThe penang poh piah (steamed Malaysian spring roll stuffed with jicama, fried tofu, eggs and bean sprouts) was light and sweet. The Mee Siam (stir-fried rice noodles with tofu, shrimp and bean sporuts in a tangy sweet (they say \"spicy\") Thai chili sauce, sprinkled with ground peanuts and sliced hard boiled eggs on the side) was fine, too. Not terribly expensive, and credit cards are accepted now (minimum purchase of $12).\n\nNoise level was acceptable, though I had to strain somewhat to hear my fellow diner (she's soft-spoken, so that didn't help). Worth a visit if you've never been.\n\nUPDATE: February 22, 2008 - went here with a large, raucous party - food was delicious - management and service was patient with our group, considering how drunkenly rowdy many of our group was... also, the interior has changed since the last time I was here, and renovations are still happening.",

  "text": "Russell's is another place I go to semi regularly yet have not managed to review.\n\nI have been here on dates, with friends, and solo... The full spectrum \n\nExcept for twice I have always sat at the bar (makes me feel more a part of the action and I love bartenders). I will note that at Russell's sitting at the bar does lead to slower service. \n\nThis place also gets busy. \n\nIn the mornings they have an excellent pastry collection (they also sell this throughout the day too). I can recommend their snicker doodle cookies. Their chocolate flourless torte (typically offered with strawberry slices or blackberries on top - you can specify which you want if they have the selection). And the best of the best... Their pumpkin cheesecake.\n\nThat cheesecake is better than the cheesecake factory's pumpkin cheesecake and way less than the $10 or so Cheesecake Factory charges. I think a slice is around (or under) $5. It has this whipped cream on it that is firmer than cheesecake factory's, but not nearly as hard (and inedible) as Hartford's. Take note Hartford Coffee there is a whipped cream garnish that can withstand a display case that tastes good and is not ridiculously hard.\n\nThe cheesecake is also incredibly smooth and creamy.\n\n\nAnyway. Enough dessert talk.\n\nThey also have a lunch menu that you can now only get during lunch. Sandwiches, wraps, and such.\n\nDinner menu is only served at dinner time.\n\n\nThis was a recent change.\n\nI have had the grilled cheese from the lunch menu and a modified Kitchen Sink salad from their dinner menu.\n\nI have also had the Moscato on their menu (with a dog named Moscato that should not be surprising). And it is great.\n\n\nThe staff is really friendly.... In particular this younger guy they have on staff who I would peg to be 22 and this other guy who tends to pour my wine.\n\nThey also have decent wine pours here. Varying depending on who pours  and how bad they surmise your day was.... \n\nGreat little neighborhood spot that is worth a trip even if it's not your neighborhood",

When I first walked into The Dive it was like I was back home where i grew up in No-No-town.  The atmosphere is pure dive (love it).  The people hanging out there are all real people with no false pretenses.  The Dive Bar makes no apologies for what it is....... a drinking hole and for that they get 4 stars.  I've only been there one time (so I'll reserve any stars) but I hope it's not my last (hint! hint!).  I'd love to go back and sample some more of their awesome selection of beers.  Of course the owner/bartender, Johnny, kindly dressed in a pretty nighty to amuse all the patrons.  He was a little flat chested and all the tattoo's were a little distracting, but otherwise he was a sexy damn bartender (lol) with a great attitude.  I'd go back anytime and I'm sure I'd be just as welcomed.  Thanks Susan!",

I'm basing my review solely on the fact that really good, fresh seafood is hard to come by in St. Louis, and at my first visit to Oceano, it rocked.  I didn't come here looking for a \"trendy scene\" or anything - I just came for good seafood.\n\nMy friend and I hit up lunch here on a Saturday, which wasn't very busy.  We both ordered a glass of wine, and the server brought the bottle over for us to taste before pouring us an entire glass - smart!  Maybe it's just me, but I've never been to a restaurant before where they did that.  Highly appreciated, and once again, smart.  We started with the crabcake, which was awesome!  The lemongrass-chili aioli that it sat on worked perfectly with the crabcake.\n\nI had the lemon-crab risotto, which was phenomenal!  Seriously, I've been having dreams about it since.  The lemon flavor was really delicate, and the risotto was so creamy.  It was awesome!  My friend had the grouper sandwich, which was surprisingly good  - much better than you'd expect a group sandwich to be.  All the flavors and textures there worked really well.\n\nWe had no complaints with the service, which was always there when we needed it, but never bothersome with checking on us too often.  The entire staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall, an awesome experience that will hopefully be the first of many to come!",

The menu had a good selection of apps, salads, sandwiches, pizza and wings. We went with the fried pickles.  They came in an order of 6 fried spears with a spicy ranchish dip that I didn't care for.  The regular ranch worked better. Kids loved their sweet tea. For dinner my daughter ordered the caprese sandwich, my son ordered the Del Mar pizza and a calzone, I ordered the turkey sandwich. The caprese sandwich looked yummy and my daughter enjoyed it, only stating that it could have used more balsamic glaze. My son did not like the Del Mar pizza. The cheese was clumpy, looked under cooked and the taste was off. He added salt and pepper; still flavorless. He said the calzone was okay, nothing great. That suprised me since the owners also own Northeast Pizza; one of the best pizza places I've been to. My turkey sandwich, recommended by our waitress sounded incredible. Turkey on a crossant with melted guyriere and fresh strawberries. Tons of good turkey! But sparse on strawberries and cheese. It also needed some type of dressing possibly balsamic glaze. Overall it was okay. I just felt like everything needed some extra umpf.",

They have a lot of machines to choose from, and I especially love the circuit machines. You can work out for 39-45 mins and work out your entire body! This location beats any of the locations in Philadelphia.\nLove the fact that I pay only 20 dollars a month and I get to bring a guest with me every time to the gym. I also save on drinks and can buy them for half off compared to the other members who pay 10 dollars a month. I also can utilize the tanning beds and massage chairs as much as I want to.

I love the space more than anything because it just has a great ambiance. Service has always been good and I have had good dining experiences. The first dinner I had was fabulous. It was a vegan chickpea curry and the flavors were spot on, paired with a Brussels sprouts dish that was delicious. Since they will rotate their menu items a bit I didn't see the curry on the menu the next time I returned. Second time we got a smoked tuna dip as an appetizer which we both enjoyed. For our entrees my boyfriend got the Korean fried chicken and I got the grilled halibut. He said the chicken was pretty good although he loves spicy so he wanted more of a kick. I thought my entree was tasty paired with the green chimmichuri sauce on top but I wasn't sold on the tomato farro that was underneath the fish. The dishes were all visually appealing but the second visit didn't wow as much. Overall I think this is a nice place and I'd love to come back for a cocktail sometime as well. Highlights for me are service and ambiance.",

  "text": "I am a loyal customer of a coffee shop near Three Brothers Coffee and I was convinced that I needn't go anywhere else. However, TBC  makes me want to be a new regular patron! I saw all the awesome reviews and I thought (somewhat guiltily) that I should try it out. The bottom line is that the ambiance, food/drinks and staff are all on point here. If feel obliged to give your business to the same regular place I urge you to try something new here!  \n\nThree Brothers Coffee have the same owners as the next door Cumberland Transit, specializing in outdoor apparel/gear. I like supporting places that fuel my love of the outdoors so TBC melds well with that. Looking around the cafe, it is nicely decorated and has a hip/modern vibe with the artwork that is displayed. \n\nI ordered a Golden Axe ($5.25) which is one of their seasonal drinks. I asked the barista if it was better hot or cold and she said she liked it both ways so I got it hot. The Golden Axe is a Vietnamese inspired iced americano, brewed with a coconut-ginger syrup and topped with a coconut sweet cream. It is only slightly sweet but has an usual depth of flavors. Really unique and great drink! \n\nThey have a case with freshly baked goods and when I saw they had goodies from Dozen Bakery I knew I had to get something. I am more of a savory breakfast eater so I got the ham and cheese croissant ($4.50). This was a big croissant and I tried to eat it as slowly as possible to enjoy it but it still disappeared. \n\nA couple of minor weaker areas of this cafe. Prices were too high for my liking. I didn't like spending $9.75 on breakfast when I felt like it was a dollar more expensive for each item than it should be. Parking can be tough if the rear lot is full. There are a few metered spots outside the front as well. \n\nOverall, a quality cafe with many boasting rights. I can imagine this being a treat once in a while for me as I did enjoy it.",

  "text": "Ok, so the location leaves much to be desired. However, don't let that deter you from checking out this spot that busts out some seriously amazing food! We have been there 4 times in a very short period of time because lemme tell ya, we're hooked!\n\nIf I had to die or pick one thing on their menu to call my favorite, I would be a goner. I will say, though, that their tortilla chips are unmatched in freshness, texture, and deliciousness. Unmatched! Because of that, I can't help but continue ordering the Xtreme Nachos. Now, I've had their basic chorizo, chicken, pork, and steak tacos with just cilantro and lime so I could sample the meats and decide on the champ amongst them. All were exceptionally delicious. However. The steak edges over the others, and for that reason, I can tell you in earnest that the steak Xtreme Nachos are a must try!  I cannot stop ordering them and it's quickly developing into a problem for me :)\n\nThe place is gaining popularity, no doubt because their flavor combinations are just really on point. With that comes my only observation for potential improvement. The space is obviously very small, and because of that, I recommend calling ahead to pick up your food rather than trying to eat it there. Fine, no problem. Everyone loves a fantastic hole in the wall even if just for take out. But the last time we went to pick up, it was hella busy. It took forever to get through on the phone to place my order, the food took a long time to be ready, and when we got there, there was no place to park. Still, issues we as consumers can figure out how to deal with. However, and here's the crux, the execution that night wasn't the same as other nights. I could tell that the food was prepared and plated in a hurry and the proportions were not as balanced as in previous visits. \n\nXtreme Tacos is my current favorite spot for Tex-Mex, and no doubt the same is true for others. My sincere hope is that they are able to keep up with their growing popularity and maintain consistency in their portions, presentation, and flavors so everyone can continue to focus on just how fantastic this little taco spot is! Because it IS truly fantastic and they do some great work in that kitchen! Keep it up, Xtreme Tacos. We love what you're doing in there!",

The dining room has paintings of various breeds of dogs on the walls and nice comfy chairs. For food we started with the oysters and mussels - I would highly recommend both! The mussels were in a delicious white wine broth and among the best I've had! For entrees we had the Harvest Salad with shrimp and the trout entree. The portions are sizable and food is all organic and uses foods that are in season. Not sure why the negative reviews except seems they are mostly for happy hour.

Maybe I should just forgo my home in East Nashville and just live in a suite on the 10th floor?\nHow very Chateau Marmont of me.\n\nPart of the reason that event planners such as myself like to host events at the Hutton Hotel is because they are just THAT good. Seriously.\nThe location is central and close to everything. The staff is always friendly and the service is excellent. I also love the chic' interior design and always refer all of my out-of-town guests to book here. \n\nTheir Director Of Events J.

With Pastaria, his love for all things Italian is on full-display, and it's pretty impressive when you keep in mind the oversaturated Italian food scene in St. Louis.\n\nFor Neopolitan pizza fanatics, Pastaria should be at the top of your list. They've perfected the craft of the wood-fired pie, and it stands among the very best pizzas that I've had to date. For purists, go for the Margherita, and don't look back. The crust has a wonderful, bouncy bite, with the authentic char on various sides of the crust that balance well with the SM tomatoes & mozzarella. Going forward, I'll probably exclusively order pizzas when I come here - they're that good.\n\nIronically enough, despite what their name indicates, I wasn't overly impressed with the pasta...I tried the Cacio e Pepe, which was the recommendation of many, though I found it to be a bit bland. The noodles, however, were obviously fresh & perfectly al dente - I just wish there was more flavor to be found.\n\nNonetheless, Pastaria continues Mr. Craft's streak of phenomenal restaurants, offering something new & modern to traditionally business-centric area that is downtown Clayton.",

For serious, I've never been let down by their luscious concoctions.\n\nIf you can grab a table or even a comfy chair in one of the middle rooms, you're sure to fall in love with it, too.

  "text": "As with the Cherry Hill branch, the best thing about Turning Point is their french press coffee.  Really great!  We went today for breakfast.  I ordered 2 eggs over medium.  Kudos for cooking the whites and not the yellows, but the heat was too high, therefore, the edges of the eggs were brown.  I didn't eat that part. Overall, not bad.  I don't know, why, however, eggs seem to be so difficult to master for many diners and breakfast places.  I also ordered 2 pumpkin pancakes - this time of year, I love to try everyone's pumpkin pancakes.  The one pancake was underdone and gummy.  The other one was better and I ate most of it, however, it was made with nuts and seeds, which I didn't expect.  It wasn't horrible, but I would prefer no surprising crunchiness in my pancakes. Amy's still gets my vote for the best pumpkin pancakes around!  Turning Points service was good.  I would go back if only for that coffee...",

  "text": "A quick review of our carry out experience here at Caleco. It was a busy Friday evening on the street as there was a big Cards home game. Somehow inside things were calmer and quieter. We steered our way towards the large fish tank and the nearby counter to place a carry out order. Yes you can call it in but we were already in the area and just popped in. \n\nTonight we wanted to try a St Louis style pizza and ordered a large thin crust with pepperoni, sausage and white onions. It only was a 20 minute wait for the pie to be ready. We walked down to the stadium area and back to see what was going on while waiting. \n\nWe brought our pie back to the hotel and enjoyed it with a bottle of red wine we already had. The crust was thin and crispy. The cheese was a mix of several cheeses giving it a thicker taste that what we normally experience and less stringy. I hear some people don't care for it but we loved it. The other ingredients were fresh and tasty. \n\nWe devoured the pizza in no time and were left wanting more. One of our favorite pizzas on our trip.",

  "text": "The United Artists Galaxy Theatre is certainly one of Central Indiana's older \"contemporary\": theaters with stadium style seating and a sound system that reminds you how much technology has advanced in the last 20 years. \n\nThat's not a compliment. \n\nIt's a go to movie theater for promotion screenings, however, because it also tends to have larger auditoriums and is a great choice for those screenings expecting high attendance. If there's one thing I love about it, it's that they do offer very limited \"single\" seat options. That is, I can actually go into the auditorium and find a seat where I don't have to sit next to someone else by getting out of my wheelchair. The majority of theaters tend to have companion seating. \n\nThe seats are older and tend to be less comfortable than what you find in most theaters. They aren't horrible, but they definitely aren't plush. Prices tend to be a tad higher here due to tax issues related to the downtown stadiums, but the prices are still on par with most area theaters. \n\nThe staff is friendly, though they can be a bit \"in your face\" at times if they are unfamiliar with you. This is definitely one of my least favorite theaters in Central Indiana, and I can't say I'd recommend it for a film that utilized high special effects. They do offer special film series offerings throughout the year, especially during the Summer months, and despite my reservations I would note that it's still pretty consistently crowded.",

  "text": "The Tie Dye Grill is a quirky '70s-themed eatery on the east side of the thirteen-hundred block of Shadeland Avenue. There is ample convenient parking directly adjacent to the south side of the building.\n\nThe establishment has a single medium-sized dining area with booths and tables providing seating for approximately sixty-two patrons. The kitchen is largely open to the dining area. The walls are covered with posters and other '70s memorabilia. There is a single TV mounted in the southwest corner of the dining area tuned to a '70s music channel.\n\nWhen I arrived at mid-afternoon on a Monday there was one waitress and two cooks on hand. The waitress extended a friendly welcome and encouraged me to take a seat anywhere.\n\nThe menu is comprehensive with appetizers; soups; salads; hot dogs; a variety of sandwiches including paninis, subs, and burgers; a full list of sides; and kid's meals. The selections all have cutesy '70s-themed names; e.g., Lava Lamp Wings, Crimson & Clover Chicken Salad Plate, Purple Haze Portobello Mushroom Sandwich, and so on. I ordered the Garfunkle French Onion Soup and the Brown Chicken Brown Cow burger.\n\nIt was with the food that things began to fall apart.\n\nThere was no soup in my bowl of Garfunkle French Onion Soup. The bowl was instead completely full of soup-sodden bread cubes with some caramelized onions under a layer of gooey cheese. Top to bottom, there was not an actual spoonful of soup anywhere although I guess I could have pressed some out of the bread cubes. The only discernible flavor (and that not particularly pleasant) was that of the bread. I keep referring to them as bread cubes and not croutons because they showed no evidence of ever having been fried or toasted.\n\nThe Brown Chicken Brown Cow burger was cooked exactly to my specification. However the gravy was watery and the overall dish very soggy and quite lacking in flavor. Further, I had seen the dish delivered to the pass right as the one waitress began taking orders from a table of five, including two young children. By the time she was able to negotiate their food and drink orders, turn in those orders, and then bring me my food, it was all room temperature.\n\nThe theme is an entertaining novelty and the prices are quite inexpensive, but the food is simply not worth the trip to this eastside establishment.",

If you have any questions, just ask and they love to help you! The restaurant is more spacious than I expected for a strip mall place. \n\nYou're given a menu and an informational sheet that defines common words from the menu. Point of interest: they have 3 different kinds of imported Ethiopian beer to choose from.\n\nWe tried a cabbage sambusa and a beef sambusa, which are similar to an Indian somosa (fried dough with a savory filling). Both were great but the cabbage had more flavor. All other dishes came on top of a circular piece of fermented sourdough that you are meant to eat the food with - you can request rice or French bread if you don't like it but it has a very mild flavor! \n\nThe lamb was not de-boned so beware. I would recommend the \"tibbs\" - either chicken, beef, lamb, or goat meat fried with peppers and onion in a delicious sauce. The vegetarian sampler platter was a great variety of authentic spreads and the perfect appetizer. The baklava for dessert was the best I have ever had! So perfectly warm and sweet.\n\nThere was a variety of other customers there, one family who brought their adopted Ethiopian son to eat there for the first time, it was awesome to witness! It seems good for takeout - I noticed quite a few people walk in and get their food for takeout within minutes of arriving.",

  "text": "So I officially started my vacation today (yay!), but had to spend the first afternoon of it at the dentist (boo). I figured to treat myself as compensation I would go have a long lunch a couple beers on a patio. I found myself at Joe's Place for the first time, and am very glad I did.\n\nThe service was excellent, even with just the bartender running the whole place. My $5 lunch special pizza was far from gourmet, but it was large enough for two and there were lots of topping options. The side salad was enormous, and more than just a pile of iceberg.  \n\nThe patio was completely shaded, and off the street - ideal for a too sunny afternoon. The part that put it over the top was the customer service and welcoming atmosphere. Besides the bartender/server I mentioned, the guy at the smoker (Bill?) when he found out I was spending the first hour at my vacation at Joe's, bought me my next beer. How surprisingly nice!\n\nAll in all, a great experience, and I will definitely be back. I recommend you bring a friend, split lunch and a side or app, and both of you can get out of the place with a filling meal and even with a beer and tip for under $10 a piece!\n\nOh, I almost forgot, the music selection was a major plus: old blues and and country. Loved it!",

There are some good seats and some bad seats but the BEST seats are reserved for the \"high rollers\" for the Silver Legacy.  So you might wanna be a gambler there if you really want to get super close.\n\nMost of the time we have the \"bad\" seats and still find a way to enjoy ourselves at most shows.  The security staff does a great job in keeping the crowd from getting out of hand.  They also have huge screens if you just are unlucky enough to get stuck behind that 350lb 6'7\" guy with the pimp hat.  You can still catch most of the best parts of the show.  \n\nThey have lots of bars out front too.  The alcohol prices are a bit gougey but not sports stadium level.  Last concert we went to was 311 and they even had the smarts to do a 311 drink!  Love that kind of creativity.\n\nMost shows wont go past 10 because they need to get people out gambling.  Parking at the Silver Legacy sucks...I suggest just parking at the Circus Circus and walking the nice walk from that parking garage.  Unless you are driving a smart car, then go ahead and park at the Silver Legacy.",

When I replied yes, she asked if she could tell me what the have to offer. Why of course!\n\nSo they offer pretzel crusted chicken tenders, dark meat and white meat, spicy vs mild. They also have some sweets that I didn't indulge in (but baked on premises!) I also got their mac and cheese, and jalapeno corn bread. \nSo the way they price things here is based on weight. And if i remember correctly it's either $7.50 or $8.95/pound I can't remember.. I'll update when I check! \nBut as you can see, it's kind of pricey. For my chicken,  cornbread and mac n cheese it came to $15.46 (and I got 5 pieces of chicken tenders). \n\nI'll give it to them for the mac n cheese. It was awesome flavorful, with a good crust on the top!  The chicken was A-OK. It was decently juicy, but not very flavorful! Kind of bland.  But the crust was nice and crispy! They also have a handful of dipping flavors for 50 cents a piece. I opted for the pesto parmasean which was super awesome. \nThe cornbread was pretty good. A ltitle on the dry side, but I really appreciated the amount of jalapenos in there! I love jalapenos :)\n\nI'm not sure I'd be back just due to the pricey-ness and OK value of food.

I struggle deciding because they are all so excellent! And I eat it ALL never gets sickening. Ice cream is usually too sweet and tastes like sugar mush with whatever \"flavor\" they say it is. but Jeni's flavors are so legit. So fresh, and while they are sweet it's not overwhelming in the least. It's a natural sweet. They all pair so well. So fresh and perfect!!!! I will come here often once we move down here. And my kids are going to loooove it!!!",

  "text": "After having been with AT&T for 6+ years, it was time for a change. My phone was toast (a Samsung Blackjack II that had some water damage via spilling juice on it,) and I was ready to make the jump up to a phone that could handle being a phone, texting, AND data. I had previously been to the AT&T store up in Broad Ripple and was unimpressed both by the customer service and by the plans offered. I'm not even sure I was shown any plans or options or really anything other than the sales person's phone and how \"cool\" it was. Now, enter the Sprint store. I walked right up to the counter, was shown service plans, offered a few options via an easy to read pamphlet, and was then shown over to the phones to take a look at the different options. The salesperson was very up front with me about which phones are good, which are bad, which people like, which people don't like, and offered me some good solid advice on the difference between a $50 android phone and a $200 android phone, explaining exactly what the $150 extra was buying me, which I appreciated. Of course the plans that I was shown on top of the all-too-fancy phone that I had chosen wound up being fairly expensive, I don't feel like I was cheated out of any money or that I don't know exactly what I'm spending money on. Sprint does a very nice job of making things simple for the consumer, which I love.\n\nThe next day, I realized that my contacts hadn't been switched from my old, sad phone to my new, shiny phone, so I went back into the store. I had to wait about 15 minutes to be helped, which wasn't a problem. My only gripe about my whole experience with this Sprint store was that while I was waiting, I wanted to mess around with some of the other phones... but a lot of them weren't working! Had I wanted to buy one, I'm not sure that I would have if the store copy wasn't even working! But that aside, I had a great experience and am not looking forward to any troubles with Sprint.",

That's run by the Sail.\nBut if you wanna eat, take a number from the hostess and w onait.\nThey don't have enough chairs and tables.\nIf you order a drink, you might find yourself wandering around looking where to sit since the tables are for food.\nThe food comes out of an ugly concrete bunker too far away.

What else is new?\nOh,  and drinks are overpriced.\n$8 for a draft beer, plus tip. Serioiusly?\nYou better love sports because that's all on the TV's and the sound is turned up.

She really knew her stuff when it came to the wine list which was impressive and was genuinely happy to let us try different wines to find a great pairing for the evening.\n\nTo finish this perfect dinner, we had a chocolate lava cake (with a candle for the bfs bday.. yay!). Definitely a favorite of mine and I would love to come back and try out a happy hour.",

There is also a great upside in that they deliver in the Town and Country area. And on top of that, they also offer a great selection of sushi.\n\nThe food has always been extremely tasty and they have all of the staples. Hot and sour soup, egg rolls, General Tso's chicken, orange chicken, sweet and sour, its all here and you can pretty much guarantee that you will find something for everyone. The sushi selection is also great, with all of the sushi staples, plus a few specialty rolls.\n\nThe delivery service is fast, and ordering can all be done online. I've never had a problem with any orders. The pricing is extremely good, and $20 dollars will get you more then enough food for two people.\n\nI love ordering from this restaurant, and I highly recommend that if you are in the Town and Country area, put this on your delivery list.",

It's really more food than you can possibly eat. The pita is an amazing big hollow puff cooked in the wood burning oven. \n\nThe staff is very pleasant and efficient. In fact, there are tons of people working here! It's a beautifully lit warm space. Lovely decor. Big, tidy bathrooms. \n\nThe only weak link was the desserts. We ordered two and one was OK and the other way too sweet and just kind of weird. Unfortunate because there are many simple middle Eastern desserts that are delicious. One needn't be so complicated. Coffee good. \n\nAlso, no coat check or coat rack. No place to put one's raincoat, gloves and hats on a nasty winter night. So you're left awkwardly draping it over a small chair and sitting on it. Not pleasant. Even the Melrose Diner has a coat rack! \n\nHighly recommend.",

They have great little snack items too and are well priced. We had a group of 9 and the bill was hardly even $200. We had a fantastic time and the nutella sandwich which was brought to me as my birthday treat was super cute. My only micro-gripe is the service. I know we were a large group and our number kept growing(which I realize is annoying seeing as I am a server) but they could have been nicer to us.

They were greeting the girl coming to sell stuff... \n\nAnd never again did I think the staff was speaking to me or did the staff speak to me. Moreso felt they were silently judging.\n\nI had the opposite experience at the Greenwood location, so it was truly strange.\n\nAnd the funny thing is? It's like Pretty Woman.

Our server said \"house made\" almost every other word, because so much of their stuff is made in house. What's not to love about a small restaurant that serves top-notch food and is extremely welcoming?\n\nWe had a group of about 15 visit the restaurant on a Tuesday afternoon in early November, which was the day that some of downtown Reno lost power. The restaurant literally got power a minute or so after we walked in, and they said they were open for business. We were seated by the owner and a wonderful server, who were smiling and friendly and explained the menu and specials. They also informed us that the food would take a while to make, but that didn't stop them from still providing great service and checking in on us multiple times. \n\nWe started with chips and guacamole, which involved fried corn tortillas (left in large circles so you could break them to your desired size), and they were homemade! The guac was divine and had a hint of wasabi, something that was totally new and delicious to me! I'm typically not a wasabi fan but I loved it!\n\nI settled on the nachos, which were made of those fabulous chips and piled with carnitas, shredded lettuce, jalapeños, pico, cheese of course (but not the fake stuff!), and to top it off: red chili sauce, chipotle crema, and cilantro pesto! These nachos went down in my \"best nachos ever\" book.\n\nAll of my friends who got sandwiches RAVED about them, so that's absolutely what I'm going to try next time!! For those who are looking for healthier fare, you'll be pleased to know that their sandwiches are served with a side salad and not fries! \n\nAnother item that looked highly intriguing was their coconut cilantro rice, which is another must-try for my next visit. Man, it looks like I'm just going to have to try everything on the menu!!",

The fam and I stopped in for a bite last week having no preconceived notions about what we were to expect, other than we all love Mexican food, and try to eat it whenever we can!\n\nThe restaurant is nice, clean, and welcoming. The waitstaff is a bit aloof, and our waiter only periodically visited our table, each time we had to ask for him to come over, but when he did he was friendly enough.\n\nI did ask for some extra salsa a couple times, and never got it. So there's that, but they were busy and I realize this spot hasn't been here THAT long, so maybe he was just new and still getting the kinks worked out.\n\nThe table chips are the same old unseasoned, bland chips you get at pretty much every Mexican restaurant in the South, but their salsa was a clear winner. Excellent flavor, not overly spicy, not bland, not overly chunky, but not watery/ketchupy either. Noticable herbs and spices mixed in with onion, cilantro, and actual pepper seeds. Very tasty. Cheese dip was also good.\n\nI ordered a burrito I wish I could remember the name of. I want to say that it was like \"Arandas\" or something like that. Either way, it was MASSIVE! There were 4 different kinds of meat in it (carnivores-dream), and it was very, very good. I think it was pork carnitas, steak, chicken, and chorizo. Each one was cooked and seasoned very well, covered in cheese dip, and all tasted delicious together. The rice and beans were your standard for a Mexican restaurant, but serviceable.\n\nOne detraction is that their bar drinks and margs are QUITE pricey, with an average of $6 per. While I understand they do run occasional specials, that's just too much for a single drink. We did not get any drinks because of this, so can't say if they are good or not.\n\nOverall, we had a good meal, I left with a takeout box (which almost never happens) and it was very affordably priced! We'll likely go again when next in the area.",

They're very specific...because any sort of wavering will deter you from returning. That is of course if: you don't like smokey tiny rooms the size of your walk-in closet that are too-loud and stuffy. \n\nShowing up at opening on a weeknight...yeah..go ahead...accept your existence of being a yuppie who likes to go places other than your balcony. It's okay...really...you like to drink beer. There's nothing wrong with it. \n\nThe wait staff here is just...plain...kind. They answer your inquiries about what song is playing. They just like you. Really...people like you. I promise. \n\nPlus, they won't make you feel bed for ordering the good beer (ahem...local brewpub who can't stand it when you order beers that aren't their own...). In fact, they love you for it. And, I love you Wellington for having Domaine Dupage on tap.  You're not going to find better beer on tap for that price anywhere in the city. Everywhere else it's either $2 domestics or $5-6 micros. Cheers to this anomaly!\n\nThe new bar food menu is refreshing to see. Cheeses, meats, soups, salads. A bit too decadent maybe for Broad Ripple? Ahhhhh patooey...call it \"chevre,\" simply out of spite of what's down the block! \n\nIf you're running late and you show up at 6, be prepared for smoke -- a lot of it. And somehow the Wellington convinces me I like to watch folks play darts. \n\nThen, on Fridays in the basement the bluegrass...the coziest party in Broad Ripple. Just arrive early to get a table...if not you'll be that casual couple that thought they just could pop in, walk down stairs to find 50 people stomping, clapping and quaffing, and you're left only to retreat to the same ole, same ole.\n\nIf only we could convince them to open the basement on pint nights for those not inclined to smoke....\n\nO, and don't be alarmed there's a security camera in the joint...it's gotta be for these amazing tables that seem like they're right out of a Victorian mansion.

And they their house-made cocktail sauce has strong bite - or should I say a giant smack? ...because that was spice-ay! \n\nWe also got the barbecue oysters.

Probably the best I've had in a while. I also ordered the crawfish ettoufee. it was good, but I had plate envy for my friend's shrimp and grits. \n\nThe bloody mary I ordered was alright. Not the best. It was a tad too thick and had the consistency of ketchup. The flavor and spiciness were there, but I should have ordered another shot of Tito's and thrown in some more Worcestershire to thin it out. \n\nService was great. I appreciate how it was so busy, and yet our server kept reminding us to \"take our time\" and \"enjoy your food.\" Love the Big Easy mentality. \n\nI'll totes come back.

Just opened this weekend, I popped in on my lunch break today & it was madness. Decided to come back after work and it was much less crowded but still had a steady stream of customers pouring in. The store itself is small, with the majority of products being women's clothing. They do have smaller sections for shoes, men's, kids & accessories. Prices are high, much like regular Bloomingdale's stores, although they were offering a scratch off coupon upon entering the store giving you between 15% & 50% off your purchase. A nice discount which ends after today (11/14). The checkout line was long & moving slow, the inventory was definitely picked thru and some areas like accessories were sparse. \n\nIf you're a lover of Bloomingdale's, I'd come back after the newness wears off. Otherwise you're better off going to Nordstroms Rack across the street, where its bigger & has broader selections.",

The bar matches the length of taps, the line bar was three people deep while we were there.\n\nFood\n  Drink - Sixty plus choices is awesome.  I had one beer from their taps, Homestyle by Bearded Iris Brewing.  I was a little disappoint in the flavor.  I also filled my free growler that they handed out when you entered the store.  We will see how that Stone Brewing's Stone ///Fear.Movie.Lions Double IPA tonight.  \n\n  Food - I was surprised they actually serve food, so that is a plus.  My wife had the kettle chips that were not anything special but the pizza looked great.\n\nService - Greeted by the staff warmly.  I know the place is new and a lot of training is going on but my growler was not filled to 64 oz. line.  Most places fill it beyond that level to remove the air which is a beer killer.  Bonus for small little sample glasses, love the idea.\n\nFuture - Of course, and the Beer Club UYE is already setup.",

It's a really nice hip place inside...very refreshing. We went at lunch time so the place was packed...the line was basically at the front door. The line moves rather quickly so do not let that discourage you. One of my favorite parts about this place is how you order. There's no pressure if you've never been here before because you order from a computer screen....like wawa....and you even pay on the spot. They advertise that they grow locally and it's all natural foods which I appreciate. So you're probably wondering why the 3 stars. Well honestly....I wasn't that impressed by flavors. I feel like I may have ordered the wrong combination....I chose to make my own....and perhaps I just didn't pick the right sauce. I am definitely going back to try something else!",

I absolutely love everything about this little dive of a donut shop from the vintage, neon sign to the ironic name (as it's not a drive in or a drive thru). I've been coming here for years and have NEVER been disappointed. Their goods are fresh and delicious AND they stay open late on the weekends! If your order is less than $10, be prepared to pay cash. Also, if coming on a Saturday or Sunday AM, be prepared to wait in line (but it's worth it).",

  "text": "We were EXTREMELY excited to join the Plantation and Swamp Tours. We chose Cajun Encounters because of the raving reviews as well as the lowest price for a combo tour 2 Plantation + swamp tour and we could do the tours in different days.\n\nWe took the Plantation Tour first.. it was fun and low key.. Stacey, our driver, was a local NOLA and she seemed to LOVE her job. She was really informative.. she kept us entertained during our 50 minutes bus ride to Laura Plantation. I will review the plantations separately.\n\nWe did feel a bit ripped off realizing that each plantation actually only charges $18/person ..so the $70 price tag for the 2 plantation tours + pick up service.. seemed a bit overpriced.\n\nHowever, Stacey was GREAT, we requested her to drop us of at Central Grocery after the tour instead of our hotel and she oblige. She even showed us Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's house at the French Quarter.\n\nThe next day... we took the Swamp tour.. and our driver (he didn't introduce himself, don't know his name) WAS HORRIBLE! He was on the phone constantly and he didn't navigate or give us any story about NOLA at all.. the 50 minutes bus ride was so boring!\n\nThen, we went on the swamp tour.... our tour guide was friendly and nice HOWEVER he obviously didn't have enough experience to be a swamp tour guide! He's just a local young man who is likes to talk and talk and talk. When I joined a swamp tour..I wanted to see and know about the swamp. I don't care about American Idol or any hollywood actors and actresses and I can watch E! or ET to get updated of how screw up they could be. I don't need my swamp tour guide to ramble about hollywood all trip long!\n\nIt was not the season.. we didn't see lots of gators like what people claimed. We only saw one tiny gator and the tour guide failed to entertain the gator with marshmallow and he also didn't stay long enough to allow us to watch the gator. Then he enjoyed talking about hollywood so much that the boat got stuck between the trees.\n\nThe only thing I enjoyed from the swamp tour was feeling the breeze when the tour guide speed up the boat! Also.. our boat didn't have a cover and hello it was 12PM, 90 degrees and on an open swamp and we were there for about 2 hours!\n\nAfter the boring tour.. we were all hungry and tired and HOT... but we had to wait for 45 minutes because the bus was LATE. The bus was FULL and the only empty seats were at the back of the bus..that's ok EXCEPT..,the A/C was LEAKING to the BACK SEATS so the seats were all drenched and my bf and another tourist had to experience water dripping to their shoulders during the trip back to our hotel.\n\nFor about $50/person... the swamp tour certainly failed to impress ..what a rip off!",

I even love how their bread tastes!\n\nI got two sandwiches for me and the bf one day. The line wasn't out the door when I showed up so I actually got my sandwiches really fast. When I was ordering, the guy behind the counter was super helpful. I told him it was my first time here and he gave me a few suggestions on sandwiches -- what's popular, what i may like, what would survive the drive back to the bf's place. When I got the sandwiches, the girl had a big smile on her face. I'm really fond of people smiling so that and hte nice weather put me in a fairly good mood for a while. Good job blues city deli!\n\nAnd then there were the sandwiches. They were both really good. I got something with turkey, bacon, and honey mustard. The turkey was meh but the honey mustard made up for it. I liked the crunch of the sandwich and the bread was really chewy and nice. I'm used to sandwich breads being a bit crumbly and bleh so this was really exciting. The other sandwich I got had beef and other stuff in it. I don't remember what I got, but it was really good and I ate it way too fast (in fact I ate my half before the bf got to his sandwich halves).\n\nAll in all, it's a great place for sandwiches... no, if only it were closer to home.",

My meal couldn't be stored(soup based) so more than half was thrown away which felt wasteful.

But the food and beverage was everything and more. \n\nI ordered several cocktails off the menu including the Love You Matcha, A Reno Ten,  Basil Watermelon Margarita, and the JaeTea  and every single one of them was perfectly balanced with tons of different layered flavors and unique combinations to make drinks that were completely different from each other but that all pleased my palette. \n\nWith the restaurant being mainly tapas style, we decided to try tons of things off the menu. Some of my favorites included the pork belly sliders, duck wings, and the smoked & charred flatbread. \n\nEverything we ordered was exploding with so much flavor, presented beautifully, and perfect for sharing. \n\nBut let's just talk about these desserts. We ordered the chef's choice dessert platter and the chef did an amazing job picking out the stars of the show. The bourbon caramel brownie was so good we ordered more of them to-go. \n\nOverall, I want to eat here every day to be able to try all of the absolutely fantastic things on the menu. I highly recommend putting yourself in the very capable hands of the chefs and staff here and letting them guide your experience through their menu.",

You get your choice of three spreads and they are all served with pita.  We ended up ordering 2 of them so that we could sample all of the yummy goodness.

I ordered more bread because four pieces just wasn't enough!\n\nNext up, friend and I ordered the Grilled Trout, Pork Belly, and the Collard Greens. These dishes are meant for sharing, but honestly, I was hoping that I could just eat them all for myself! Grilled trout was cooked to perfection, and the Pork Belly was a nice take on pork and beans. The collard greens were a nice surprise with generous chunks of pork shank. Seriously, the flavors from all of these dishes were on point.\n\nI am hoping the menu doesn't change because I will be back! And I am super excited that it's opened for lunch!",

  "text": "This is a wonderful, local, family owned grocery store with a wide array of options for dietary restrictions and normal diets alike. Tons of vegan and gluten free alternatives - from cheeses and breads to cookies and ice creams. I've found things here that I've never seen in other places, especially in their spice section! They also carry the usual staples. Some awesome discoveries we've made here include palmini - a pasta made from hearts of palm, The Bean & Beet burgers, and garlic chips from Sam's bakery. They also carry a Florida made tempeh - Arto Moro Tempeh - that is outstanding!\n\nIn addition to the grocery, there are affordable beer, wine, and cider options - both individually canned and packs. Lots of local breweries as well as international. \n\nThey also sell pre-packaged snacks and meals towards the back right of the store. While a bit pricey, they are *so* tasty and a nice treat when you're in a rush or feeling lazy. We love their Cajun macaroni salad, curry tempeh, blackened tofu, no egg salad, and kale slaws to name a few. The only thing I'd avoid are the Brussels sprouts as they are consistently undercooked. \n\nAs a huge bonus, everyone who works here is extremely friendly, and remembers the local crowd. I'm often asked about different products as I'm checking out or even given recommendations on similar ones to try next time. The only downside is things are a bit expensive, but you're paying for high quality products so that's to be expected. We usually go here for specialty products and get most of our produce and staples from more affordable places like the farmer's market.\n\nWould recommend this spot for locals and tourists alike!",

Everything was delicious and came to the table quickly. I especially loved the sausage pancake \"corn dogs\". \nFor my meal I got the breakfast tacos And a side of bacon. I was pretty full already but excited to see that the side of bacon came with five perfectly cooked slices. \n\nThroughout the meal, several employees stopped by to help in various ways, everyone was helpful.

The elements of such a bar are simple but hard to pull off: classic honky tonk music played by expert bands, an intimate atmosphere that's the opposite of the 6-story tourist traps around it, and some down-home folks who just love to drink and mingle. You'll get it all here. \n\nI walked in to listen to the band and ended up sitting at the bar and drinking local beers while admiring the enthusiasm the crowd had for some good music. there were more boots and cowboy hats in here than any other bar on the strip, if that tells you anything. They have an upstairs, too, but the long back bar is all you need to make your own good time. \n\nI would easily recommend Layla's to anyone trying out Nashville and looking for a classic experience. It's a honky tonk to remember!",

I was super reluctant to order a $7 side of bacon knowing that most places charge you an arm & a leg for 3 measly pieces but since I love bacon so much, I gave in. Thankfully, I was FAR from disappointed- I must've gotten a quarter pound of their amazing, delicious bacon & could NOT have been happier!!!! I was elated. I also had their French toast which was good but it was served with way too much butter (next time I will ask for it on the side) & not enough syrup (next time I will ask for more syrup). duly noted.",

We had a hell of a time getting here since it was on the other side of the parade from where we were staying.\n   Nonetheless, we had a great meal. \n    Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious. \n    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.\n   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.\n   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.\n    G's Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. \n    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.\n    Truly a memorable meal. Way better than most hotel restaurants.",

We came here for a retirement luncheon so I didn't really know what to expect.  We had pre-ordered our lunches ahead of time.  We had the patio seating right in the middle of the fireplace and some trees and bushes.  It was quite a lovely setting even though yesterday was a little too warm.  They had the fan blowing for a little breeze which was nice.  Our waitress was very attentive.  I think we had at least 27 people there and she was able to get everyone their drink orders in a timely manner and seemed happy to serve us.  They got the order out fairly quickly once our manager arrived and gave them the go ahead.  \n\nI had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries and a pickle.  It was delicious and I will definitely come back.  The only thing I didn't like is the fact that there are actually 2 Saint Denis Streets in that town and my GPS took me to a complete opposite street which was nothing but a quiet residential area.  The one that this place is actually in is called RUE St. Denis St. but even on their website, it doesn't state RUE.  So be mindful of this little confusing thing.  Otherwise, the service and the food were both fantastic!",

Let us try a crawfish before we purchased a boil plate, showed us how to eat it, just so sweet and caring. \nShe heard it's our anniversary and gave us extra oysters.! \nI will always be back there, it's my staple spot in NOLA. \nThank you Yissan for the great returning experience :)",

  "text": "Finally got to try my most anticipated summer opening of this year!!! Here's everything you need to know! \n\nService: For me, I tend to value service a lot when I eat out especially because I can for the most part cook the food I like to eat, service makes the experience from great to amazing if done right.  At Southgate, the service was great.  The hostesses were very accommodating and helpful, as this was my first time eating there, they were very helpful explaining that they do take reservations, what their hours were so far, and when they planned to launch the full menu.  With a group of about 10 people, I knew we were going to be a bit of a hassle to seat, but they did an amazing job of having us feel welcome and even sat us at one table and then moved us to the chef's table after it had opened up.  The waiter, which we had actually recognized from elsewhere was super attentive and helpful as well, he seemed to have that balance of not being pushy when it came to ordering and moving service along to being completely absent when we needed to request things.  The other owner guy (having recognized him from the philly.com article) also gave us an extra dessert which was a nice surprise after apologizing for long wait times (which for us we didn't even have to wait that long!) and that attention to small details let's me know they care about their business\n\nDrinks: I. Love. These. Drinks.  From the various cocktails I had gotten to sample from different friends there wasn't a single one I wouldn't order again for myself, and some of them had alcohols I didn't even like.\n\nFood: For dinner I got to try the wings, koreancini balls, pulled pork sandwich and the shortcake dessert.  First off, the wings are probably the best I've had in philly so far, the only thing that would prohibit me from ordering more is the price.  The koreancini balls to me were probably the most disappointing thing I ordered all night.  We had ordered on plate to split amongst our table, and the ball that I ended up with came to me unseasoned and bland, it tasted like fried fluff and by the time I got to my plate, there was no dipping sauce left on my plate because I ate with savages and the late bird gets nothing at that table.  My pulled pork sandwich came and I thought it was great, my only mistake was probably letting it sit while I waited for the rest of my table to get their orders.  In that time I guess the juices of the pork and slaw soaked into the bottom of the bun a bit, making me wish that that bun was toasted on a flat top for a bit +/- a tiny bit of butter.  I also REALLY LOVED THE FRIES. I could eat buckets of that stuff.  My only wish was that it had some sauce to dip it in, because naturally fries are the perfect vessels for sauce delivery and it felt weird not having any.  So, we asked the server and he offered us some of the sriracha ketchup that came on other things, and it was AMAZING!  Ideally if there was a combo meal where I could get wings and a plate of fries and a beer for ~$12-15, I'd be back at least once a week if not more.  Finally the dessert was a very fresh and clean finish.  I don't particularly care for the super sweet desserts of this world, and this was the perfect balance for me where it was just sweet enough for me to want more.\n\nOverall for a soft opening this was a strong showing.  Service is right where it should be and I'm sure most of the food kinks will be worked out over time.  And I can definitely see this place becoming a local watering hole soon!  I'll be back.",

Every time I leave Snap, my thoughts are \"gosh, I should have paid at least $4 more for my meal.\" The atmosphere is inviting and hip, the employees are top notch pizza artisans and the food rivals \"fine dinning\" pizza establishments throughout Philadelphia. \n\nChoices for the make your own option abound, but doesn't suffer from the over abundance syndrome that the Cheesecake Factory or other poorly ran establishments fall for. I love the BBQ pizza I make: BBQ sauce, chicken and bacon, poblano peppers, provolone and mozz. After its baked, I finish it with corn salsa, arugula and cilantro lime sauce! PS- add a first layer or the herbed butter to any pizza crust! Makes a huge difference. All of that is just $7.49!!!\n\nThe Nutella pizza reminds me of an old childhood favorite back in the South. No visit to Snap is complete without it. \n\nThe presentation is one of my favorite aspects. The wood blocks distinguish your creation from the traditions metal pans that everyone else uses. It's classy yet simple.\n\nBe sure to visit Snap over any other pizza place in the area. Your stomach, and wallet, will thank you!",

This is a very classic white tablecloth, tuxedoed waiter type of restaurants, but amazingly it is not stuffy or pretentious.\n\nOnce you arrive at your table, the waiter appears with a loaf of freshly-baked bread and lightly-salted butter as he takes your drink order.\n\nHaving been at Mr. B's many times in the past I went straight for my favorite things on the menu. To start I had Mr. B's Crabcake, which was a pan-sauteed jumbo lump crabcake served with their classic ravigote sauce. The crabcake was mostly big chunks of lump crabmeat with very little breading or filler. Following that I had their incredible seafood gumbo which was a classic New Orleans gumbo with Gulf shrimp, crabmeat, oysters, and okra served in a dark roux sauce.\n\nAnd now for my entree (pardon me while I wipe the drool off my mouth).... I ordered the legendary Mr. B's Barbequed Shrimp which is their signature dish. Head-on Gulf shrimp barbequed New Orleans style, served in the shells with Worcestershire-spiked peppery butter sauce and French bread for dipping. The recipe for this amazing dish can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_shrimp.php\n\nTo finish this amazing meal, my lovely friend and I split an order of the Brennan family's Creole Bread Pudding. The recipe is rich in eggs, cream and butter, served warm with Irish whiskey sauce. Oh, and THAT recipe can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_breadpudding.php.\n\nSeriously, one of the best meals on the planet!",

  "text": "This review is for brunch only.\n\nMy old man was in town and we needed a brunch spot pre-Eagles game that would have both excellent food and delicious drinks. We decided on Supper for Brunch... yes Supper for Brunch. Due to its proximity to the Broad Street line and its cool atmosphere, this was an excellent choice. I went with the Dixie Biscuit and Old Man River got some weird mushroom toast dish. Yeah he always orders the weirdest thing on the menu, and he certainly did not stray from that yesterday. \n\nMy Dixie biscuit was comprised of the following elements: country ham, scrambled eggs, pimiento cheese, and a side of grits and pickles. I of course added the sides to the rest of the biscuit like any country gentleman would do and it was delicious. Very interesting take on a breakfast sandwich and it did not disappoint. However, the name is a bit misleading- there was no Dixie in my Dixie Biscuit as I explained to my dad. The pimiento cheese was some false impersonator of real southern pimiento cheese which should have been made with Duke's Mayonaise and much thicker than this spread. The country ham was not nearly salty enough and you could barely tell that it was in the biscuit. And the grits were closer to polenta rather than the stone ground beauties you would find in the South. With that being said the final deliverable was still delicious, but if you're from the South don't expect to find any hint of Southern cooking in this dish.\n\nThe bloody mary was lacking the blood. It had little flavor, tasted a bit watered down, and had no kick to it at all. For $9, it was not even close to worth it. So for a total price of $49 before tip this meal was good, but not quite worth the chedda. Certainly check this place out for the cool atmosphere (loved the light fixture/sculpture) and fresh food, but don't have too high of expectations.",

  "text": "Classy lounge to wind down after a long week. The bartenders are all friendly and make the drinks quickly. This place stands out from the other bars in the area because you can tell the drinks are considered an art instead of a quick tip from customers. I tried the Cask and Ale Old Fashioned on my visit here. I loved it! I do suggest asking the bartender for extra cherries because I only got one. Like previous reviewers have mentioned, the drinks do run between $12-$13. I did not get a chance to try their food but next time I will be tempted to.\n\nThere are a few small tables along the back wall facing the bar and some big tables outside for everyone to enjoy their drinks. The area leading to the bathroom shows black and white pictures from the Prohibition era, clearly displaying the theme of this lounge.",

  "text": "I was super stoked when I first heard about WCT- a taco truck! Here in Indy!- so I made it a point to try them at the first opportunity. The first time I went happened to be when there was a big event in the Rip- the mayor was there and all, and I probably was the only person who was like \"get out of my way, I want tacos!\" I liked the tacos, spicy as they are, because they bring the flavor. I don't have any quarrels with that- but I don't like their attitude, especially when they were on Mass Av and I drove there in December, because they announced they were opening at 10:30. I got there around 11, and they weren't open yet. I went up and asked what was up, and one of the guys said really snottily \"We're still cooking the meat, so just wait around.\" It's cold, and it wasn't like I arrived before you were supposed to open. I did wait and get my tacos, but the love affair was over. I catch them as it's convenient for me, but I don't stalk them like I used to. (Also, I've since learned that because Indiana actually doesn't allow food trucks to actually *cook* in the trucks, there has to be a physical kitchen they use. Theirs is on 49th and College. No excuses for not being open on time!)",

  "text": "My son had a good three word review for this place, when he misread the name on the menu. \n\nCheeseburgers and Parasites \n\n\nActually it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. The problem for me, was that if a particular food item is displayed in your restraunts name, it better be damn good. These burgers weren't paradise, they were simply average. They have some decent burger toppings ( I myself got a bleu cheese and onion straw burger, which was decent but not wow) but I was surprised to see that the CheeseBurger in Paradise burger was simply a cheeseburger...served with a pickle. \nTo go along with that, the fries were blah, McDonald's shoestring sized yet not even as crispy, laying somewhat limp on the plate. I prefer steak fries, I like girth ( ...that's what she said!) \n\nUpon being sat, the song \" Cheeseburger in Paradise\" by Jimmy Buffett, was playing over their stereo system. I had a brief but rational worry that this song would be played on a loop as I ate. Thankfully, it wasn't nor were we subjected to JBs entire catalog but the CIP song was peppered liberally in the song rotation , so that we heard it at least 3 times while dining. \n\nThe tikibar decor was cool but not terribly impressive. The service was very good, although it was pretty dead even for a Monday night. My son loved the paper umbrella that came with his kids drink and I could tell that his older sister, who proudly orders drinks and entrees off the regular menu, was seething in jealousy yet too proud with her \"adult\" status to ask for one.. \n\nI didn't use the facilities but both offspring reported that they were \"freaked out\" by the peeping fish placed strategically in the bathrooms. We didn't get dessert but their Chocolate Nachos sounded intriguing , until I saw the faces of a couple nearby, who got the dish. It didn't look pretty. \n\nOverall, it was an average experience. I would not go out of my way to either return to CIP or to avoid it. When there are so many places to choose from, CIP needs to distinguish itself from all the other restraunt chains. My advice would be to \"beef\" up those titular average burgers and to get those rude fish out of the bathrooms, that like to watch people make toilet.",

  "text": "Was in town for the weekend to attend a soccer game; great front desk staff; lovely lobby, clean rooms, comfortable beds, but small pillows! I misread the time for the typical complimentary breakfast; thought breakfast was served until 10:00. I made it to the lobby around 9:40 and was informed that breakfast was over at 9:30. However, the kitchen staff was nice enough to give me a few bagels, some yogurt, and fruit, which was appreciated. The next day, I was sure to get down to the lobby in plenty enough time to make my waffle! \n\nLoved the space in the rooms for the most part; includes a desk area, sink and counter space near the mini-fridge; but absolutely did not care for the small bath area; hardly enough room to turn around! Also, didn't like that the sink was in an open area outside of the toilet/shower space. Not gigantic deals though, specifically since we only stayed two nights. The staff and the cleanliness more than made up for my issue with the bathroom layout. :o) \n\nMasks requited indoors, which works for me! Social distancing requested.",

  "text": "I can't review Buona Via on the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant or even the attentiveness of the servers. I can't review on any those things because even though we fully intended on going to Buona Via for dinner, we didn't even get through the door, or successfully into the parking lot for that matter. \n\nMy wife and I were going to Buona Via for Dinner because we had a Living Social deal we wanted to use and we're still hunting for a new \"go to\" Italian restaurant since our previous one drastically changed it's menu. \n\nWe pulled into the parking lot, into a spot (there were more than a dozen open spots) and parked the car. Immediately we found ourselves being yelled at and told that we couldn't park there. It was the \"Valet\" who insisted that spot was valet only. So even though we were already successfully parked, we decided instead of dealing with it to pull around to the other side of the restaurant and into another open spot. We got out and started to walk in, when we were again confronted by the 'Valet\" and told we couldn't park there because it was valet only. \n\nGrowing tired of this stupidity I asked where we could park. The response I received was that I could give him my keys and he'd park my car... even though I had already successfully parked it twice, I needed him to park it for me. I had no intention of giving this guy my keys so I inquired where I could park without giving him my keys. His response was nowhere, apparently the only way to park at Buona Via is by handing your car over to a \"Valet\"\n\nNow to further expand on this completely pretentious load of shit, Buona Via is a standard Italian restaurant in the suburbs, this isn't some high-end restaurant in Center City where a Valet is expected. On top of that the \"Valet\" at Buona Via wasn't exactly someone whose first impression screamed \"trust me\". Yeah he was wearing a red jacket and tie, however I am confident the last time this guy wore a tie he was being referred to as the defendant, as in 'Will the Defendant please rise\".  \n\nSo back to the review, the defendant ... sorry, valet,  says to me \"If you don't want to give me the keys I guess you don't want to eat here\". If was the smartest thing he had said all night, and I told him so. \n\nFuck Buona Via and fuck their stupid valet, there was no way I was eating there then or ever in the future. Which is really just that much more foolish when you consider the entire reason a business makes an offer through Living Social, Groupon, etc is to get customers exactly like me. A fat guy who loves to go out to dinner, has no problem grabbing several bottles of wine with dinner and when he finds a place he likes goes there over and over and over again. \n\nIn conclusion just skip it and go somewhere else. There are plenty of other Italian places in the area that will make you feel like they actually appreciate you business. Not to mention ones that are damn good and less expensive for the same menu items. Search my Yelp history to find those places and please take this advice, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. You'll be happy you did.",

  "text": "This is a review of the Knitting Factory as a venue for live theater, which I didn't know they were capable of doing until a week ago! It's great to see them really expanding the type of entertainment they're offering. \n\nHere goes...\n\nWhen I saw Avenue Q was going to be playing in Reno, I was giddy with excitement about an opportunity to see a live musical performance here in Reno. Then I realized it was at the Knitting Factory, a black box type venue known more for hosting music more than any other type of performance art, and I was all of a sudden hesitant. I had no fear the actors would put on a great show, but I wasn't sure if the venue could keep up with them. \n\nThree cheers to the Knit for setting up seats with great viewing angles of the stage. There wasn't a bad seat in the house, and we were just about front and center. I loved the show and my time watching it, but as I've experienced here in the past, the sound leaves a little to be desired. There were many times when it was hard to hear the voices of the actors on stage over the music, and I don't know if that's a sound board error or an acoustics issue. Either way, I found myself leaning over to my fiancee, like an old man losing his hearing, asking her what they'd just said. Sometimes she knew, and sometimes we both guessed until we figured it out through context. \n\nWhile the guessing game and acoustic challenges were annoying, I'd say my experience at the Knit was A-OK and I would not hesitate to see another live theater performance there again. I'm glad they're bringing a variety of acts to the venue, and I look forward to what comes next.",

When I arrived the location was clean, open and they had outdoor seating options available.\n\nNow onto the food! The Philly Magic Cheesesteak was tasty. This is one of the first vegan steaks, I've had so it's hard to compare to anything else. I was surprised by the flavor and similarity that it had to steak made with beef. I wasn't really sure about the presentation, the box reminds me of school issued lunch and the amount wedges were rather slim. Because of my health conscience journey, I will most certainly be back and I would highly recommend! Happy Eating!",

  "text": "I've been wanting to try VV for several months, I finally had the opportunity to do so and I know I'll return. The things I loved about it were as follows:\n\nAmazing customer service by Jill. She had some help running food out but she was the most knowledgeable about the restaurant. She gave very good wine recommendations and knew this current  list. She seemed to be passionate about this place and her role in it. \n\nI loved the modern industrial feel with lots of open space, and the uncluttered display of bottles to go. While the bar is not large, it seemed to be a popular place for locals to meet up after work. And with options to taste up to 40 different curated wines before deciding on which to further enjoy, I'd be a regular here for sure. \n\nI love the business model too. Where else can you sample this many distinct wines to aid in the decision to bring some home? Even restaurants that have vast cellars keep the wine by the glass list relatively short. Then if you did find something you loved you'd have to find it on your own. I found the prices to go to be pretty moderate, I think some bottles were under $15 and with the highest one being just shy of $100. I kind of regret not tasting that one;) \n\nI'm sorry to say I did not love the food, nor did my dining companion. It wasn't bad, but just not up to the standards of the wine I tasted. I think we enjoyed the fig flatbread the most.( half price during happy hour or if on Yelp, half off with check in) Jill also recommended the chicken one but we ordered other items. The poutine was decent, long fries which were very crisp in a tasty brown gravy, maybe too much gravy to fry ratio. Nice size serving for the price too, I took half of it home. The salad was plated beautifully and the beets themselves were perfectly cooked. It was also the most generous amount of burata I've ever seen on a restaurant plate. But the overdressed greens kept this from being great. The mussel small plate was a good size entree for smaller appetites, but broth was very salty. The lager base was ok, but had the broth been tastier, more would have been needed. The shellfish itself seemed a bit dry from lack of broth, and not the plumpest or tastiest we've had. I had the skirt steak main, the meat was done to a perfect medium, nice, and even in this cut was still pretty tender. But the onions were not really caramelized as they had been for flatbread, the broc rabe was very good, just slightly charred but only 3 twigs. The rice was ok. To me the dish was competent in components, but they did not really enhance each other. Lastly the chocolate cheesecake was just ok. The homemade whipped cream helped a little, but I'd pass on this unless you like less dense versions of this dessert. Of everything we tried, I'd probably only reorder the flatbread or poutine. \n\nI think the wine tasting part of this experience is 5 stars. I tried 10 wines in total, half of which I'd consider full pours of if not a to go bottle. For the whites my fav was the Chablis(sadly this was not available to go) but I also enjoyed trying the NY Chard and pitting it against a twice as exp Napa one. For the reds my clear winner was a Portuguese blend that I almost purchased, a reserve from 2013. Second place was a Cab Franc, recommended by Jill. \n\nA return trip will be focused mainly on the wines, and I plan on checking their website to see as new things are added. I'm not giving up on the food here though, but will likely not try to make it into a meal just yet. 4.25 first real wine tasting post Covid Yelps",

Okay, I may be a lush, but it's hard to resist not trying several wine selections from Tria's well-chosen (and adorably named) list... also it's hard to not to indulge in one of their decadent dessert wine, port and sherry selections either.\n\nMind you, my friends and I were there for at least three hours. (So consuming five glasses of vino in the course of three hours isn't bad, is it? IS it? sheesh) - and in that time, the staff was super helpful, available and friendly.  It was some of the best service I've had in Philly in quite some time.\n\nLoved the location, the ambiance, the space (much roomier than the original on 18th), the big windows - .  It has a decent bar area, that seats about 10 or so.\n\nThe cheese list is delectable (I only wish it was more extensive!) -I loved that they didn't skimp with the baguette slices (and they gave us more without having to ask) - Also, I liked that they offer up a spread with your chosen cheeses.  We went for a chèvre, a gres des vosges and a super bold cheese with paprika (name escapes me now) - and they respectively accompanied it with a cherry spread, a truffled mushroom paté and sage honey.  Yummers. \n\nAs our three hours rounded out, we also indulged in some bruschetta - try the smoked mozzarella, roasted tomato and prosciutto (can one ever get enough bread and cheese? that's the question) - and salads (which they generous split for us, no hassle!)\n\nI can see how the place can fill up - awesome service + faboo wine/beer/cheese list and a place you can stay three hours chatting, drinking and eating away without a care in the world?

We were blatantly ignored as we were seated at the bar for more than 10 minutes, and 3 staff members/bartenders walked right by us without any acknowledgement. We were finally able to place our drink order after flagging down someone who appeared to be a manager. For what they charge there was very little alcohol. Presentation wise the drink was lovely! Taste and value... not worth it. We finished our drinks and continued to wait for our food. We ordered salads. To go. Only to be told they thought we left?!? The place is not that big. If we weren't directly next to the order here sign/window we were at the bar directly across from the order here sign/window. We ended up waiting over 45 minutes- for simple salads..they weren't that busy at all.. which is what we couldn't get over .. or what the issue was.. and the dismissal of our presence at the bar. Once we finally received our order- it was made incorrectly and the guy didn't even apologize or offer to fix it. At this point we just wanted to go home as to who knows how long we would have been there waiting on the correct order. Overall that could have been overlooked if it customer service had been welcoming and well just more customer oriented. Sadly, the trophy fish doesn't not earn a trophy from me. Our first visit was not a lovely experience, which is disappointing as it could have easily been a weekly favorite with the live music, ambiance, and seafood!",

  "text": "Car Wash USA is a high-quality wash (really more like a mini detailing) for a high price, i.e. you get what you pay for. You will spend around $20 to get your car washed here, but you'll get a pretty detailed interior and exterior cleaning of your vehicle. \n\nWhen you pull up you tell the guy what kind of was you want (I usually get the classic, which is about $19 with tax) and then walk through the building. You can watch them prepping your car to go through by spraying it down and then following it in a small windowed hallway as it goes through the wash. I love my car so much, so I especially enjoy marveling at it as it slides through the wash. \n\nYou can then pay the cashier, cash or credit, while they pull your car around--when it comes out of the carwash, it's not done; this is where the real work begins. They spend about another 15 minutes vacuuming, polishing, doing the windows inside and out, etc. After you pay, you wait in the inside waiting room or out on the patio for the guy working on your car to wave you over when it's done. I usually tip them $5-$10 depending on how dirty the car was, for a total of $25-30 for the wash. Again, certainly not cheap. \n\nThe staff is not really that friendly here, but they get the job done, and that's what matters sometimes. I usually prefer places with friendly staffs, but I'm so picky when it comes to my car, that I will put up with a compromise when it comes to getting the job done right. \n\nSo if your car either likes to be pampered or if it's dirty to the point of almost needed a detail, I recommend coming here and trying it out.",

  "text": "Thai Place is my favorite...well...Thai place, in the suburbs.  It's almost as good as some of the spots in Philly.  The pad Thai is amongst the best I've had, mainly because there's a Smokey flavor to it, and I love burnt food.  I usually get takeout, but the dine-in experience was good from what I can remember...except the one time when one of the chefs must have called out, because I saw the waitresses cooking in the back. Hence, service was unusually slow that day.  Overall, I highly recommend this place, and I'm already a regular here.",

  "text": "We finally made it to zeppoli! Every time we called for reservation they had been on vacation and finally I was able to get through to make a reservation. I had heard so much good things about it and it was on my list of collingswood Italian restaurants to try. I finally got to cross it off my list! \n\nThis place is tiny and popular. Reservation is a must. BYO. We bought a bottle of wine with us. The food is really good. I'm in love with the pesto and next time would love to try the gnocchi. We also ordered a whole fish which was a special and a rabbit dish. The fish was descent but have had better. Stewed rabbit was okay. We both felt that it wasn't seasoned well. \n\nService is okay. The servers are very nice but not very attentive. \n\nI would definitely come back but only for pasta and maybe to try the appetizers. The pesto is making me drool.",

It was so good!  Way better than your average bar food.\n\nMy recommendation would be to check this place out for the \"must see\" events that they have here, get some food at the den and have a good time.",

Brioche bun was delicious and has a slight crisp which I loved.\n\nThe nice surprise was actually the sourdough bread with olive. It was about $10 (or $12 I can't remember). It's actually sour but not to the point that you get a bitter aftertaste. It's so clearly hand-made since the air bubbles inside are uneven. The bread has a nice crisp on the outside and it's very soft on the inside. Also quite chewy! I rarely taste such darn good sourdough bread...I hope the overhyped LA bakeries can take a lesson from Helena Avenue Bakery. \n\nDefinitely coming back if I visit SB again in the future!",

Because this was some of the snarkiest service I've received in a long time.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI hate to kill a place based on one, young employee that probably doesn't even work there anymore, but... this just couldn't go any other way.\n\nYou know those people that sense a younger, laid-back customer, and feel that they can be a bit snarky because of it? Hey, I'm all about that... and that's what I thought I was experiencing here at first. But then after about 6-7 comments, I was pretty sure that she was just incredibly rude, and not worthy of employment.\n\nCondescending, impatient, treated me like a child, complained loudly about other customers, etc, etc, etc. If only I could remember her name, she would be \"on blast,\" as the kids say.\n\nNow... back to not killing a place just based on one bad customer service experience. One of the things I love about traveling new places is trying their local coffee shops. Apparently New Orleans is not a coffee city, as it seemed CC's and PJ's were the best two options. Both served terrible coffee. Like gas station quality. \n\nNew business idea: hipster coffee spot in NOLA. Feel free to steal that one from me, because you'll have no competition. \n\nOr, I'm just a dumbass that managed to miss these places after much research.",

  "text": "Loved our first, albeit brief, visit to the Children's Museum. I can really see this museum appealing to children of all ages -- and I'm talking kids at heart, too. Sorry kids, but I need to get in on some of this building block action, too. \n\nWe spent most of our time in a play area upstairs with a large water table type area, a music room, a sand table, and a little kids area for safe crawling and exploring. Our 10-month-old (crawler and confident stander) had a great time exploring. He doesn't wear shoes yet so his socks got totally soaked near the water table (we had a spare set -- make sure you bring extras if you have a shoeless little). He especially loved the bird houses that chirped when you opened them and the log you can crawl through, all in the little kids area. It was just his speed. He also loved his ride on the merry-go-round and we enjoyed the clever little parade they have at 5 o'clock to herd everyone out of their quickly and festively. Free parking rounded out some of our favorite parts of this visit.\n\nWe were there over winter break so it was fairly crowded. We didn't get to try out the slide and we only stuck to that one area since both the kids in our group are right around 1. Our visit lasted for about two hours but it was just enough time for our kiddos to work out some energy and have a good time exploring. I think an older kid could definitely see and do more. \n\nWe went with a friend so were able to get in for free using their guest pass. I think the family membership is definitely the way to go. It's an easy drive/park to get there and I think any kid would be happy as a clam to go back there again and again. Keep in mind, if you use a babysitter and want them to be able to use the pass, make sure you choose the correct package -- you need to show your ID to use the family pass, so it can't be transferred to someone who isn't you, even if they're taking your kiddos!",

  "text": "I totally get the cult of Federal Donuts; the lovechild of Zahav and Percy Street BBQ.  \n\nThe old corner shop is in a warren of narrow old streets in Pennsport, and the space itself has a tiny charm that could easily be a time warp to the 18th Century.  Standing in line or waiting for an order creates a sense that time has slowed down, and even the dust in the sunbeams may have danced for our forefathers. The combination of Korean style double fried chicken and deep dive dough balls is a natural fit for preparation, but I am not yet comfortable eating both at the same seating. The double dose of fats challenges my guilt. \n\nWhen we arrived mid-Saturday afternoon, all of the fancies were gone, but the 3 daily offerings were available.  Folks were gnawing on their chicken bones at the counter, blissful in their enjoyment.  We ordered a half doz mix of Vanilla Spice, Maple Brown Sugar and Strawberry Lavender to take with us on the drive home.  They were individually bagged while hot, and placed in a larger paper bag, and ultimately triple bagged in a plastic take out carrier.  \n\nOpening the package, the heat and moisture has made the paper sacks damp, but still held in plenty of the essence of the dough wheels. We tried a Vanilla Spice.  It was covered in sugar and cinnamon, cake-like, and uber sweet. The bite and chew was pleasant, but there was no crispness due to the water vapors.  Very tasty.  A very good donut.  Over the next day, the rest were devoured, and although the taste varied with content, the general experience was the same.  A nice round piece of cake with a hole in the middle. \n\nFederal Donuts deserves another house call earlier in the day when the fancies are in stock, and again for a unique fried chicken experience, which seems as varied as the sweet fat tires. \nAfter those ingestions, an update will be in order. \n\nUntil then, the consumed donuts themselves were not life altering, but were certain A-Okay!",

The atmosphere at this location feels a bit more upscale considering the decor. The service is usually pretty decent; I've never had any problems, but I've never been blown away by it either.\n\nThe food is always good. The chips and salsa are tasty and they keep them coming. It's hard not to fill up on chips. For appetizers, the guacamole and the cheese crisps are great. I stick to a handful of entree items, but I love anything with the carne seca, especially the chimi with red enchilanda sauce. The chiles rellenos are excellent, and the enchiladas banderas are also delicious. I love the chicken tortilla soup as well. I don't prefer their rice though; it has peas and carrots in it, and I detest peas, but whatever.\n\nIf I get a drink, I will usually do a house margarita, or we'll order a pitcher for the table. We rarely get dessert, but if we do, it's the tres leches cake. Yum! I've tried the flan before, and it wasn't very impressive. Tres leches for the win!",

  "text": "Great spot for a slice, salad, and a beer! \n\nBut let's dive a little deeper! The spot:\nDuring current COVID times, you can only order food to-go or sit outside in their large outdoor patio. The tables are spread apart and when they clean their tables, they put a clean sign on it. Which in my opinion is very smart and eases the mind. Great ambiance at night, they have lights and a fire pit. They used to be open late night, but their hours have shortened. They have a specials board by the ordering window, be sure to check that out. Street parking is available, mostly metered, but they have a small parking lot behind the building too. Staff is friendly and customer service has always been great. \n\nThe food: \nThe vegan ranch is everything! Grab the rabbits salad full of all the veggie goodness and top it off with this magical sauce they call vegan ranch (doesn't taste vegan either)! It's pretty addicting and pairs nicely with your pizza too. I'm a fan of their creative monthly pizza specials, you can always find them on their website. They have inexpensive daily slice specials and they're pretty big. The Ol' dirty is my favorite: salami, ricotta, olive oil, and pepperoncini - it's the perfect flavor combo and it's not too heavy. The crust is perfectly thin. I highly suggest grabbing the slice and salad special, you won't regret it. It's a great deal!  I love that they offer meat, vegetarian, and vegan options - an awesome variety of pizzas for every craving. \nBonus: You can also get gluten free crust on any regular 12\" pizza for an additional $4. \n\nLastly, don't forget the knots! If you like garlic, you'll love these warm soft pillows of doughy garlic goodness sprinkled with fresh garlic on top (which you can omit). They're served with their house red sauce and your choice of two other sauces...I suggest the vegan ranch and the creamy basil cashew spread. All vegan! So delicious! If you're feeling like something sweet, the dessert cinnamon knots are equally magical. \n\nThe drink: \nThey serve beer, wine, and cocktails. Since they have scaled back on service, they only offer a smaller menu of drinks. But on the positive side, you can still enjoy an adult beverage while waiting for your order or while dining in the patio. \n\nOverall, a great spot for tasty food and a pretty chill place to enjoy and relax.",

We started with tasty bites she grew up with: pork and rice, fried like a croquette and served with pickles and a herb mayo. Little balls of porkie goodness. Next came a sandwich...fried chicken topped with fab coke slaw on a bun. Also, yum!! I love dining local.",

  "text": "It's been over a year since I moved from Edmonton so this review is REALLY late, but I still have fond memories of Lucky Supermarket! My husband and I loved coming here nearly every week to buy our groceries (produce, meats, Asian sauces and dried noodles). We always found the staff to be friendly, especially the people behind the meat section. There was also this one guy in the produce section who always had a smile on his face. He was pretty awesome. The supermarket is spacious, bright, and kept quite clean. Prices were quite good for the majority of items compared to its big name competitor, although we would buy our dairy, western products and most canned foods next door at Superstore. Coming from Vancouver I really took for granted the availability of Asian ingredients in the city, so I really appreciated the range of ingredients and products that were not always easy to come by living in Edmonton. Moving back home to BC I knew I would miss Lucky terribly, but imagine my surprise and delight to see a \"Coming Soon\" sign one day while driving through Surrey, BC. Lucky's coming to BC next year! So, soooo excited.",

Pina coladas were on point, and even though they're from a machine, wayy more alcohol in them than the Margaritas in Center City that were more expensive. Shots are full sized, the waitress was attentive and kind, and the location is ideal for the area. \n\nAlong with the drinks, and the rowdy weekday nights sometimes, I've also always loved the Spanish fries, which stick to the paper sometimes but there is so much extra cheese you can hardly notice! Come for half-priced burger and sandwich Wednesday for an early dinner, or any night of the week for half price quesadillas and drink specials. Will eat here again soon and try something new after all these years!",

Service was good, the menu is extensive - it definitely has items other than the usual suspects at Thai places. My partner ordered the ginger lover, and I had the mango curry - they were both excellent. My mango dish was a combination of mangos, green beans, green and red peppers and tofu, in a tasty spicy coconut-turmeric base. \nI highly, highly recommend Chiang Mai - I hope the slow evening was just an anomaly. I will certainly be back to support them.",

The wait can get a little long, I think we waited for 30-40 minutes on a Saturday around 11 AM but once we were seated the service was fairly quick and food came out in a timely manner. It's definitely worth the wait though. My boyfriend and I brought our dog and sat outside and the staff were super friendly. They brought our dog water and pieces of bacon for him to snack on. I highly recommend getting the oyster Benedict. You won't regret it. They are also very generous with their portion sizes. Their Bloody Mary had a nice kick to it. 5 stars!",

  "text": "There is no better feeling than leaving Aldi with a sh*t-ton of groceries for less than a hundred bucks.  \n\nThis place keeps the costs low by doing a couple of unique things....the first is you have to \"rent\" a shopping cart if you want to use one...so be sure to bring a quarter.  Don't worry, you'll get your quarter back when you take your cart back to the front of the store and connect it to the other carts.  I freakin' love this because it is MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE at other stores when lazy-arse people leave their carts right next to their car when the cart corral is RIGHT BESIDE their car.  It really grinds my gears. \n\nThe second thing that saves you dollars is they do not give out plastic grocery bags for free.  You can buy paper bags for 6 cents each or bigger plastic bags for 10 cents.  They also sell the reusable bags for like $2 I think.  You are welcome to bring your own bags from home, too.  After you check out they have a nice big counter where you can sort and bag your items before you head out to your car which is nice.  \n\nThey don't really have nationally-known brands here with the exception of Coca-Cola.  Every item I have tried is high quality and comparable to main brands, however.  The quality is high enough that you most likely will not miss your brand name items.  \n\nTheir produce is ridiculously cheap and makes it really easy to eat heathily on a budget.  They have a great meat selection, dairy aisle, bakery section, canned goods, dry goods, beverages, and a lot of hygiene items as well.  \n\nI like keeping my dollars!  And I like high quality foods!   It's a win-win.",

We came in to talk about buying our beloved 16 CRV, asked for a price comparison on a new lease (new safety features as we start a family) and were given a number on each that was significantly higher than my monthly payment on my previous two leases (almost $500 a month) - is that any way to treat a loyal lessee? \n\nWe've purchased a used RAV4, and our next Honda (or any other car) will come from somewhere besides Conicelli. I don't know if it was the salesman in training or some other issue, but the transition between my first and second lease was much smoother (with the experienced salesman who obviously wanted the vehicle off the lot)",

You can literally smell the fruit when you walk in the door. \n\nPros:\nThe juices are delicious. You can literally watch them make it. I've tried multiple and I have not been disappointed yet. \n\nThe avocado toast is amazing. Sliced avocado versus smashed would add to the texture but overall delicious. \n\nNice wide tables to stretch out. Allows you to sit at the table with a stranger and not be next to them. \n\n\nCons:\nSeriously lacking on the greeting. Whether at the cash register or picking up to go; it takes what feels like an eternity before someone acknowledges you. Today, I timed it, almost 3 minutes before anyone acknowledged I was there. \n\nThe knives. Your avocado toast is DELICIOUS! But it is no match for the knives. \n\nToday, I'm giving 4 stars because the food is everything the company promises it will be. But the lack of greeting is a turn off",

  "text": "Came with a larger party of 5 on a quiet Sunday brunch morning. First off, the building is amazing! I'm truly in love with it, we sat on the second floor with all the bright windows empitamising the openness. It's a perfect mix of modern (gray everywhere, my favorite home decor color), with older style of subway tiled bars and hexagonal tile floors. Yes, I had to spend time and Google the history more while we were waiting. I only wish I could have experienced it in its heyday. \n\nNot sure who our server was, but she was great. We stayed for a while as we ended up staggering drink orders (a beer to start, then a whiskey, the one bloody Mary, then another etc). She let us take our time and catch up too, not hurrying us or being annoyed. \n\nBetween us all we had duck sliders, macaroni and cheese, traditonal burger, the German and the pork belly tacos. My impression was everyone enjoyed their food. The burger disappeared, we made our friend make the Wendy's \"$2.99\" joke with the sliders, the German had great flavor and the macaroni and cheese was ooey and gooey with real Bacon crumbles on top. The ketchup is house made and delcious. The tacos were good just cory was expecting soft tacos not fried, but he survived. He already said he is getting the depot burger next time.\n\nI have been craving some creme brulee which they didn't have in their dedicated and fancy sounding dessert list, but they did have a creme de pot (so custard) with house whipped cream and some sort of black sprinkles I missed the name of. Whatever they were, this was a perfect ending to my meal and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\n\nThe bloody Mary's were excellent, also house mixture. But the happy hour looks to be a good deal, about $2 off drinks and apps it looked like. I think while they have spendier items, they also have a good deal with cheaper options that aren't just olives or fries like you see elsewhere in town. \n\nI had been putting off visiting thinking it would be pretentious and break the bank, and while between us all we splurged for this meal, you come back and not spend much while still getting a lot of quality food. \n\n\nAlso they have the bean board games (the name is completely escaping me right now) out front that we all had fun with too. Ideal for killing time if waiting per chance? As well also a huge luxury couch with games upstairs too.",

Great place for groups! Our server, Asia (I can't remember the exact spelling), was just wonderful and attention. We did flights at our table and for a \"said beer-lover\", you have quite a few options to choose from. There aren't much ciders on the menu for those who don't fancy beers. Bummer. \n\nI think where I deducted a star was the food. The appetizers was great! From the wings to the cauliflower; equally flavorful and greatly enjoyed at the table.

I had to ask an employee cleaning a table to help me get the waiter. So not a great first impression. When I placed the order, it did arrive quick which was a plus. I had the crawfish etouffee. At first sight, I was disappointed at the quantity for the price. Was really small and I was done eating in like 2 minutes. Lol. However the taste was alright. I also had to ask about the dessert, waiter did not offer or ask if I was interested in dessert. However I loved the bread pudding. The cold Ice cream and warm pudding made for a nice melt in my mouth. If you like pecans, you'd love the crunch as well. I loved the ponchatoula punch. Well balanced and sweet.

  "text": "This is the perfect place for a low key, affordable quick dinner with friends, especially if you plan to go shopping nearby after!\n\nThey have a wide variety of options on their menu but I have primarily only had their sandwiches [I really like sandwiches], their variations on the club being my favorites. You can easily customize a meal if needed. \n\nYou order first and then pay and then it is delivered to you at your table with a number, super easy. If you want to browse the menu before getting up to the order area, they always have paper copies by the door. They also have a really slick to-go ordering system at a separate register. \n\nWhat is most awesome about this place? The free ice cream, yesss. Who doesn't love free ice cream? It is just a simple vanilla chocolate soft serve though. I almost always opt for the swirl in a cup to maximize amount, haha. \n\nThey also have two types of ice, regular and crushed, which gets some people super excited, I guess.",

I show her a hello kitty design I found online, WOW, she did a perfect job. She also throw in a incentive(shhhhh, don't tell anyone:)) for me which I was thrill. Don't ask me what it is, is a secret:) \n\nI returned to Love nails a second time few weeks later to get refill and a spa pedicure for me and hubby. I request to sit at Winnie's station. Don't get me wrong, the other esthetician are nice too, but since Winnie done the perfect job last time, I figure to stick with her. Again she did a perfect job on my refill. And we love the spa pedicure at Love's. \n\nReally love the staff at Love's nails. My 2 year old toddler act up every time we were there. Both times, staff came over to entertain her. They even let her soak her little feet in the pedicure station while Daddy gets his feet done. AWESOME!!!\n\nP.S. If you forget to bring cash to tip, no worries, there is a no fee ATM inside. Don't forget to get your loyalty card stamp, once is full, you will get $5 off.",

  "text": "Um, yeah.  Still friggin' delicious.\n\nJustin and I stopped by Pi before the Neko Case show at The Pageant (located conveniently across the street for all you concert-goers) this week and *finally* tried the deep dish pizza.  Now here's the thing--I grew up eating Chicago-style deep dish and I think I'm supposed to have some sort of loyalty to it because it's my home 'za, yo.  Kinda like so many St. Louisians inexplicably love Imo's.  Anyway, the point is, I've never been a huge fan of the belly bomb that is deep-dish pizza.  Too doughy, too much freakin' cheese (yes, indeed--there IS such a thing!)--I've just always preferred thin crust.\n\nWell.  Smack my ass and call me a convert.\n\n\"It's the crust!\"  I kept saying.  \"No, it's the sauce!\"  Justin countered.  Whatever it was, the deep-dish pizza at Pi is by far, hands down, the best thick crust I've ever eaten.  And I have eaten my fair share of it, people, usually begrudgingly.  No more.  I'd happily hightail it back to Pi to build another custom 'za... This time we enjoyed a pizza with the prerequisite tomato sauce and mozzarella, to which we added zucchini, tomatoes, feta and garlic.  Now, when we got the pizza I thought I spied a mushroom (which Lulu W. so aptly calls \"slugs with gills\" - yuck), but upon closer inspection it turned out to be a whole roasted clove of garlic!  Ohhhh, foodgasm.  So yeah, basically, this was the best pizza ever.  The cornmeal crust is crisp enough to stand up to the delicious sauce and just-right amount of cheese, and you can actually eat more than one slice (this I've not done before).  \n\nYup, I'm changing my tune on the whole deep dish issue.  Sorry, Chi-town.  You still rule my heart, but Pi holds a special place in my belly.",

The set-up they have for outdoor dining is well designed, and protected away from next door dinners. Although we did not get cocktails, we did get appetizers -- candied bacon strips and biscuits which are similar to the size of mini-muffins but taste more like baby buttered biscuits.

It is a gorgeous old building and there is no better setting on the south side to enjoy a bottle of wine and some tapas.\n\nThe retail store on the ground floor features some pretty decent bottles of wine. You can also buy any of the bottles and enjoy them upstairs in the lounge or bar for an extra $7.50. Even Rickey Henderson couldn't pull off that steal. You can actually buy a good bottle of wine for $15, pay the extra $7.50, and enjoy it in the house. The same bottle of wine most restaurants would sell for $60. \n\nThe third floor bar seems to be the perfect setting for a private event and you can reserve the entire space for free.

  "text": "I've thought long and hard for the past 3 years about my most recent hair decision - that is longer than I've thought about any one of my tattoos, or purchasing my car, or going to college out of state. I say all of that to make the point it was a big deal that I finally just went for it and...drumroll...permed my hair.\n\nTo preface the rest of this review, I will say I had zero color on my hair when I did this, which allowed the perm to take really well. I showed my stylist, Tisha, dozens of photos of perms that I loved and plenty of photos of what I did not want (I was terrified of looking like I stepped out of a 1980's rom-com). She knew exactly what it was I was going for. She incorporated lots of different size rods throughout the perm to give it a really natural look, which totally worked. I didn't expect it to turn out exactly like I wanted...but it did!! And I am so excited about it.\n\nThe whole appointment took about 2.5 hours and consisted of getting my hair washed...A LOT. As she styled and dried my hair, she gave me the full scoop on how to care for my perm (what shampoos/conditioners to use, how to blow-dry it,  how often to get a trim, and when she thought I should come back to touch it up.) I'm so thankful she did, because I'm already finding that curly hair is a heck of a lot different to care for/style than my natural locks. Her perms cost $140, which is a price I am more than happy to pay for her experience and expertise (she's been doing hair for over 30 years and did perms when they were in style).\n\nI left the salon giddy about my new hairstyle. I'm so glad I finally did this and I am SO thankful I came to Tisha for it. It turned out better than I could have ever hoped for! Thank you, Tisha!",

I've been served minced Birdseye chili pepper before. That can ruin your day if not handled properly.\nIt was just perfect. Just what you'd expect. The lovely basil noodle & veg. The tofu was super tender. Can't wait to see what their soups and their green curry noodle are like. Better than Nina's at Thai Esane? (Nina's game is strong y'all, and she fine too.)

Service was great, as were the margarita and sangria (and at $8 a glass a little pricey).\n\nThe menu is so varied, it was difficult to decide what to choose.  Appetizers sound delicious but come with a huge serving of chips and very small servings of the actual dip.  The entrees are very substantial, but also a little pricey for Mexican food.\n\nThe food was fine -- there's better Latin/Mexican/whatever elsewhere -- but it's such a festive and fun atmosphere that I'll definitely be back, even just to sit at the bar with friends having drinks and appetizers.

  "text": "This has been one of my favorite stops in St. Louis. While in town for a work conference my manager arranged a family-style dinner at Reeds. We were seated upstairs in a dimly-lit room that conveyed cozy despite us having ample space. Our group had a case of the giggles and a touch of the ridiculous about us so it's best for all involved that we were seated away from the main dining area downstairs. \n\nEverything I tried was amazing (really), so I'll just go ahead and walk you through our menu:\n\n+ Bacon-fat-fried cornbread with thyme butter and honey: we could have stopped here with a pan of this cornbread and I'd have slapped a five-star rating on it\n\n+ Veggie toast: I can't remember what all was on it, but it was so tasty. My coworker was kind enough to split his with me because the toast for the table had mushroom and bone marrow, neither of which I was interested in ingesting. I'm not a vegetarian [as evidenced by my ode to that bacon fat cornbread above], but I'm sure if I had spoken up when we received our menu for the evening they'd have happily made me the veg alternative. \n\n+ The best salad of all time: kale, roasted squash, pepitas, bacon, feta, and maple juniper dressing. When I read the description I was kind of \"meh\" because in general I'm not a big fan of kale, maple, or things that taste like gin. This combination though - I can't. They brought us an enormous bowl and we had more than enough so I wish I'd taken more. The chew of the squash with the crispy, salty bacon and the sweetness of the dressing was perfection. Hot tip for other kale salads: chiffonade your leaves so it can be chewed in a reasonable amount of time and effort. \n\n+ Roasted cauliflower: simple, delicious.\n\n+ Polenta with goat cheese, honey, and toasted walnuts: basically a dessert before dessert. The polenta was perfectly creamy and the nuts added the needed crunch. It came in a huge bowl and I could not stop laughing at how it jiggled when moved. \n\n+ Chocolate tart with brown butter caramel, hazelnuts, and fresh whipped cream: so rich, and so delicious. I have a major sweet tooth but I couldn't finish my slice. If I hadn't had the polenta I probably could have done it. I was full by the time dessert rolled around but I wasn't about to pass up such a lovely end to the meal. \n\nA beet salad and porchetta were also served but I did not partake - they both looked beautiful but I was maxed out on food and I don't think I'd be able to handle the fattiness of the porchetta. We also had our choice of wine. \n\nReeds helped set the stage for a perfect dinner with my coworkers - they took what was sure to be a good evening and made it excellent.",

  "text": "Olio is a great new addition to the city scene in an off the beaten path location that deserves a hotspot.  I love to see a business invest in an area that others might see as sketchy, which is how our great city continues to improve.  \nOlio even took a step further, using an old gas station and garage to build their bar and restaurant, repurposing quality materials and classic architecture.  The result is a hip, fun, and intimate landmark.  The bar side, Olio, is the old storefront of the space.  A glass door and large panel windows add light and dimension into the otherwise smaller space, creating a bright but cozy space.  Pro bartenders plus a thoughtful cocktail, wine, and beer list create an outstanding selection.  Many drink options are from spots around the globe that are new to me, such as Lebanon.  I love to try new drinks and learn about global offerings, and the staff here knows how to sell and explain these items.  \nThe limited menu of small tastes is perfect with a glass of wine.  I love to just sample some cheese and cured meats, but have also ordered various dips, tartines, and salads.  They use bold and textured ingredients like high quality seafood, Mediterranean and North African spices, creamy legumes, spicy & crunchy house made nuts, and tangy goat cheese.  They are creating food that tastes and feels good to eat.  So far, I am only missing out on trying the brunch menu, and I am eager to try that.  \nThe prices are reasonable- certainly not inexpensive, but priced just right for the quality and service.  They do have limited parking in the front lot, which is great if you are lucky enough to nab one.  They also have valet, which is a nice touch for those not familiar with the area or maybe a little nervous about the burgeoning neighborhood.",

It is a welcomed addition to that side of town which is lacking in dining options.  I  have to admit I am not a big ice cream person, BUT I had this ice cream almost two weeks ago and I have not stopped thinking about it.  I love that they are a part of the local hand crafted food movement.  They are the first in Tucson to make their own pasteurized cream in house.   And they only use organic ingredients including milk from grass-fed cows and free-range chicken eggs.  As you walk in you are greeted with the ice cream features displayed in the freezer.  There were three girls scooping away and one working the cash register.  To the left of the entrance was some delicious cucumber and fruit infused water found in many spas that really hit the spot.  It was a super nice touch.  Behind the cash register is a large chalkboard menu describing the 16 flavors.  You can also see the 15-gallon stainless steel pasteurization machine, which allows them to control the ice cream creation prcoess down to the base.  Think of it as ice cream science.  \n\nFlavors: Cotton candy; Game Day uses stout from Thunder Canyon, chocolate covered pretzels in a chocolate ice cream; Housemade bacon almond brittle in a Makers Mark, bacon, vanilla ice cream; Sonoran chocolate with chile flakes; ice cream infused with lemons and handmade vanilla cookies; Smores; Sweet Cream Honey Comb with local honey; Chocolate; Vanilla uses vanilla beans from Mexico; Strawberry with roasted strawberries; Peach;  Dairy free coconut fudge; Coffee Toffee with local coffee; Ooey Gooey Buttercake; Mississippi Mudpie; Salted Caramel with fleur de sel and Aunt Michelle's cracker cookie; blackberry merlot.  Salted caramel was a game changer.  Hands down the best salted caramel ever.  Dream worthy.  To be noted you can get two flavors ina  single scoop serving.\n\nThe also have sundaes, floats including a cheerwine float, hand made waffle cones, regular cones, milk shakes and hand crafted bottled drinks.  You can get buttercake, chocolate chip cookies and brownies as sides.  \n\nCheck out the farmhouse!  EIGHT scoops with a cookie, brownie, and buttercake  bottom with your choice of toppings.  \n\nBonus they are open to 10 on most days, and 9 on Sundays.  Keep your eyes peeled they are always adding new flavors.",

I did not expect authentic bibimpap, but this was a disappointing and way over priced experience. The menu is extremely confusing. Even after previewing it online I was still confused when I was at the counter to order. You have to pay $3 extra for the hot pot. And for a $14 entree, all you get is a wooden spoon.  The wings took forever to prepare and were not worth the wait - excessively greasy. Service was also disappointing as the guy who ordered behind us got his food way before ours - such that he was almost finished eating by the time we got our order. I hate to give any place less than 3 stars, especially one this popular. But the truth is I will never return and I can't recommend it; hence the two stars. For a MUCH better option, Kwok's is just one block away - better food, service and value.",

  "text": "Butcher & Bee was my FAVORITE meal in Nashville. The food served here is a fusion between Middle Eastern and Southern food and it is one of the best combinations ever. You can tell that a lot of thought went into creating each menu item as each bite is perfection. Between my cousin and I were completely over ordered but still managed cleared the table; we had the Whipped Feta, Roasted Potatoes, Avocado Crispy Rice and Cauliflower Fried Chicken. All the dishes had varying levels of flavor and textures but didn't make you feel heavy after eating. Must order items are the Whipped Feta (served with honey! cucumbers and pita) and the Roasted Potatoes (served with slices of chilies!). \n\nAmazing food, beautiful atmosphere and of course the best hospitality. LOVED.",

  "text": "I love this park!\n\nMy son has a summer birthday and I knew I wanted a park with a splash pad to help beat the heat.  I called the city and the parks and rec employee recommended Ballast Point Park.  Great recommendation!\n\nIt's only $50ish to rent the shelter for the whole day.  They have grills at each shelter and they are in close proximity to the playground and splash pad.  There are also bathrooms at this park - a must for toddlers.\n\nThe playground is pretty large and has some fun slides.  The splash pad is pretty nice too.  This park also has a restaurant with fresh seafood and ice cream.  The views can't be beat here as it is right on the water!\n\nBallast Point is a beautiful park with a lot of amenities to enjoy!  Check it out.",

  "text": "If you're trying to figure out if Carnival is the cruise for you: here it is in a nutshell - it's a cheap way to relax and have fun but don't expect luxury -food or accommodations - on any level. This is the Walmart of cruises.\n\nFood: not so great. 2 stars for the food. Overcooked fish/meat and overall very bland. Every meal was that way. Even the desserts were not appetizing after one bite and I have a huge sweet-tooth. If you love quantity over QUALITY then you will like Carnival. Food was way better on Royal yCarribean. If you are a person who loves to eat but likes better quality food than Walmart, then this cruise line is not for you.\n\nAtmosphere: FUN! The reason Carnival deserves the third star is that whether you want to be on the party active side or the serenity quite side, you will have fun. I have been on two carnival cruises now and both times my boyfriend and I had fun. For some reason the people who choose carnival are just easy going fun people. I think the cruisers on Royal are either quiet or family-oriented or something but the atmosphere on Carnival is more lively and younger. I saw a lot fewer seniors on Carnival than RC. More couples on Carnival too - which I like. We were on the ship Paradise and it was an older ship but it supposed to be dry docked in 2015 for refurbishing. They kept it spotless so I was fine with it.\n\nEntertainment: average overall. The comedians were funny. The DJ in the club was MISERABLE. I was hoping for more on board entertainment during the day since we had two full days at sea. Not a big deal since we spent all day at the pool.",

We love the fresh apple cider, the variety of apples and plethora of goodies like jams, picked items, veggies and honey. This is a family owned spot that has both charm and taste, plus a roaring fireplace on chilly days.\n\nEach fall they host a weekend festival with food trucks, booths, kids activities, love bluegrass music and a pumpkin patch...we go every year as it is only getting better! We always find some new booth of a local small business that we then promptly become fans of forever thinking where have these guys been before?! I'm not sure how they get their booth sellers but they do an excellent job.\n\nThe cider is one of our addictions so do try it if you stop in...it is fresh and tangy with the right amount of sweetness.

  "text": "Why 2 stars? Because the menu change is for the worse.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI really love Oxford Exchange.\n\nAnd I really loved OE Market.\n\nBut this new Mexican theme is just.... rough. Here's how it works:\n\nAs we're used to know with a lot of taco/burrito places, you pick the type of tortilla, the protein, and the veggies in a 3-step process.\n\nOne problem right off the bat is that only the most sophisticated produceista would know what the ingredients are, and what they taste like. I'm a pretty darn adventurous eater, so it's not so much the mystery, but more that I have absolutely no idea what any of these items are. A brief description on the menu board would go a long way. Here's the current process without menu descriptions:\n\n-Walk up to counter\n\n-Have absolutely no idea what you want because the menu is confusing\n\n-Ask the girl behind the counter about 2-3 ingredients\n\n-Feel unsatisfied as you still want to ask about several more items, but don't want to be that dumb that you don't know basically all of the items\n\n-Feel pressured to hurry up and make a decision\n\n-Eventually make a choice, albeit rushed and uninformed\n\nSo the ordering process isn't great, and I'm sure the employees get tired of defining what \"Ancho Creme\" and \"Bustered Shishitos\" are. But how's the food?\n\nMaybe combining the preceding two ingredients with pork in a corn tortilla was a bad choice? But this was probably the worst tasting meal I've had in at least two months. Unfortunately, the flour tortilla was no better.\n\nI just don't get the angle unfortunately. It's near UT, so they want to appeal to college kids... but the menu says hoity-toity. Still, the tacos are affordable at $3-$4, so I guess that makes sense. What doesn't make sense are the $10-$12 juices that are still being sold here. I tried one because, well, I figured a $12 juice had to be pretty amazing. Instead, it was unfortunately the opposite. Kind of watery, and hard to finish. I would have felt that I overpaid at $2.\n\nI hate giving negative reviews, but I just can't really avoid it in this situation.",

What a wonderful surprise!\n\nThe best part of the place was the amazing service we received.  Our waiter was constantly checking on us (in a non-obnoxious way) and refilling drinks.  More impressively, the owner came to our table multiple times, remembered our names, and even comped us dessert.\n\nI had the fried pork chop sandwich, and it was wonderful.  I went with the super spicy sauce, which had the right amount of kick for me.  Apparently most people find it too spicy, so even after the waiter insisted that I order the sauce on the side, the owner came out to make sure that I didn't want to switch to the normal spicy sauce.  Whatever.  Oh, the fries were perfectly crisp, and I loved the spices.\n\nMy husband had his cheeseburger, and he enjoyed it.  He had a cup of chili instead of fries, and he said that he'd happily order it again.\n\nAs I mentioned above, dessert was on the house.  The owner insisted that we try the orangesicle cheesecake, which tasted very orange-y and rich.  It was great (if you love oranges -- and I do), but next time, I want to try the neapolitan cheesecake.\n\nThe homemade chips and ranch dip were phenomenally simple yet tasty.  I'd go back to EATS again just for the chips and a beer.  But, of course, then I'd want the cheesecake.  And a fried pork sandwich.  \n\nOh, be forewarned: on Tuesdays, kids eat free, so Tuesdays are crowded with kids.  That might or might not be a positive in your book.",

  "text": "1 star?  Yes....1 star.  This \"iconic\" & historic property in Safety Harbor has lovely grounds and hosts many weddings and the likes, but aside from the gardens the place is a dump.  Our checkin process was a complete disaster where there was a discrepancy with the rate of our room due to a package we booked.  The difference was a mere $40, but rather than solve the problem the Front Desk Supervisor Rennie opted to argue with me about what he saw on his screen and he didn't care what I thought I did while booking the room; his main concern was proving that he was right and I as the customer was wrong.  That is clearly why he instructed me to \"come back here and look at my computer if you don't believe me\".  WOW!  Now there's a way to kick off a weekend as the best man of a wedding there!!\n\nOk, so there's apparently been several additions to the hotel, so getting from the lobby to some of the areas that rooms were at was like a maze.  When we finally got our keys, we were instructed to go outside, walk into the doors that say human resources, then walk past all the offices, then go to the end of the hall make a left, then go down stairs to get to our room that was apparently down in the sunken gardens.  The room was \"ok\", but goodness gracious was it HOT.  The AC ran from 3pm to 12am and only cooled off FOUR degree....yes all the way down from 82 to 78 (and no they don't have ceiling fans either).\n\nAlright, now let's get off the complain train for a second to address with the GM the \"I'll show you how wrong you are attitude\" I got at check in.  I asked four times to speak with the manager...any manager for that matter, but days went by with no response.  Once I finally got a call from the GM Ajith Dissanayake, I was greeted with a very disgruntle attitude.  I attempted to explain how things went down at check in and I kept get the \"yea yeah yea\" \"mmm hmm\"  \"ok\" treatment.  I had to stop and say that it doesn't sound like you're particularly interested in my conversation since he had rebuttals already prepared to justify anything and everything that could possibly come up.  Never once did he say I'm sorry you had a poor experience, but rather when I asked him if he was interested he started to YELL at me!!  \"Are you a mind reader?  Do you have the capability of knowing all the thoughts that exist in my head??\"  All I could say was no, but I can tell you that you're acting really unprofessional. The conversation went on and he just repeated talking about the booking process and that it was my fault there was a price discrepancy.  Hello.....this was never about the money, it was about the fact that both the supervisor and GM treated me like dirt.\n\nFrom what I've seen and heard, including those in our party, was that experiences are hot and cold.  People either manage to have a nice time or they end up needing something which involves bringing the staff into the picture and the whole trip goes up in smoke.  It's really a shame that I had to endure this crappy treatment when my best friend was spending a fortune and also getting married there.  It really left me with a horrible taste in my mouth.\n\nI did contact the Choice Hotel Corporation, but they can't offer any help aside from filing a complaint with the very person I have a complaint about, so the agent I spoke to said she didn't know what would come out of it since it's about the GM and gets sent to the GM.  The hotel is a franchise of Choice and they have no regulation over the facility at all.\n\nAll I can say is......stay at your own risk.  There's no shortage of fantastic resorts in the area.  Try the Don Cesar...it's fabulous.",

However, everything once we got inside was awesome. I was able to find a lot of Korean or Japanese goods that I find in T&T or Lucky 97 hidden and hard to find. We bought a lot of Korean staples (think fish sauce, Korean noodles, pepper sauce, etc,..etc.) But I was also intrigued with the amount of frozen food they had available. Well worth a second visit. I would love it if they had daily a sample of a product that may be unfamiliar to non Koreans that we could try before we commited to a box. I found our clerk super friendly and because of the amount we bought se threw in some Korean snacks for our family to try (our kids loved the snack cakes by the way). The only other suggestion I would have is not all the labels are translated into English with the price tag and that would be super helpful for white people like me who can't read Korean. Definitely will be back",

If you like to get a little crazy they have dipping sauces for an extra $2. It's not just fried cheese it's fried happiness.",

  "text": "I was super excited to finally try this place. Maybe too excited. It fell flat with me.\n\nWalking in it's an old warehouse and it looks awesome. It has a great open vibe.\n\nThere was a wait but not too bad for a Saturday night. Especially since we had a party of 6.\n\nWe were brought drinks quickly. Our waiter was friendly and kept up with the pace of the evening.\n\nNow for the food. Out of a party of 6, 3 people either didn't like what they had or just thought it was meh.\n\nI had This Grill is On Fire @ $9 - southwest veggie patty, ozark mushrooms, chipotle mayo, jalapeño jam, sweet chili dressed spring mix. \n\nThere was more bread than anything. The patty was bland and mostly tasted like mushed black beans. There were barely any mushrooms or spring mix. I had it minus the mayo. The jam was good and the best part of the whole disaster. \n\nThe Hubs and I ordered a large fry @ $5 to share and they were the best part of the meal for me. They were crispy, not too skinny, not too greasy, and had a great taste. He had Sriracha Catsup and I had honey mustard. We both enjoyed our dips. Mine was sweet and tangy.\n\nThe Hubs ordered The Buffalo @ $10 - Ground chicken patty, house made buffalo sauce, cheddar, bacon, ranch.\n\nHe got it minus the bacon. He said that his was really good. I didn't try it. I personally think he is just in love with buffalo sauce and that if you put it on something he will like it.\n\nMy Mom and another member of our party had the Winter Slaw Salad @ $5 - cabbage, sweet potato, butternut squash, fried Brussels sprouts, toasted nuts, thai chili dressing.\n\nMy Mom liked it. The other lady didn't. I did try this and thought it was superior to my veggie burger. The veggies were fresh and crisp. The dressing was spicy and pretty tasty. \n\nAnother member of the party ordered buffalo wings @ $9.\n\nHe said they were meh and wouldn't order them again. They tasted ok but they were tiny and weren't very many of them\n\nMy sister in law had the Fried Chicken Salad @ $10 - romaine, fried chicken, cornbread croutons, tomato, green onion, corn, cheddar, avocado ranch. \n\nShe said it was ok but mostly just ate the chicken out of it.\n\nMy brother in law had the PB&J @ $11 - bison patty, arugula pesto, house tomato jam, goat cheese, arugula.\n\nHe said it was ok but too small and he didn't like the jam.\n\nAll in all it was ok but I was let down overall. Most of us felt it was a little pricey for the quality and quantity of what we got.\n\nMos def check it out for yourself but we will not be running back.",

I can't tell the difference between the raunchy smell of the bathroom when I'm in there and the musty smell of the restaurant when I come out. OK, now on to the  wait staff,..friendly but slow as hell even on a weekday night we waited as if it were packed! Food on the other hand is pretty good, my family and I love the biscuits they serve and I love the Long Island tea cause it helps me endure the smell of this establishment. Prices are reasonable but I realized that this Lobb doesn't have a selection of dressing for your salad's only two choices in which my fiance and I didn't eat either:(...I don't want to go back but probably will cause my baby loves seafood and its not to far from home....taking one for the team again!",

Great location. Friendly staff. Gated lot for parking. Shuttle or close walk to downtown stores or restaurants. \nThe room was a nice size, very modern and new. I love the stall shower as opposed to those bathtubs with the wide arch shower rod. The fitness center was great having ellipticals,treadmills, cycle and free weights. Very nice breakfast in the morning with a sweetheart attendant who explains all of the foods, where to go, and how to cook them. Just take the breakfast sandwich and put it in the microwave on 1, not 2 unless it's the other microwave. The folks there are very nice and helpful.",

I've had two here now and I just haven't been awed the way I was when I bit into a burger at 12 south tap room.  THAT is a burger.  M.L. Rose burgers are small. \n \nToday I ordered the chili burger that sounds like a big burger covered in tons of chili and jalepenos.  Never tasted the jalepeños.  Could have picked it up.  It was served on paper that disintegrated into the burger, so don't fork and knife it as it says.  It was $9, didn't fill me up, didn't come with a salad or fries.  \n\nI LOVE the fact that they have good beer, including Green Flash's West Coast IPA, but I'm not all that keen on paying $8 for a bottle of beer.  A pint of a monstrous imperial IPA?  No problem, but not a bottle.\n\nThey do usually have attractive waitresses and bar staff, actually, last time I went our waitress was a total knockout, so that never hurts, but I'd still rather have a plate of food that is irresistible.  That is what I'm there for.",

There is so much to offer at Three Sisters - I personally am in love with the biscuits and gravy. First of all the biscuits are beer biscuits... Who knew there was such a thing? They were so good, I think I can't have them anywhere else or it may just ruin my experience. My husband said \"dang, those are some big biscuits\" and they were! The sauce on top was to die for. Not too salty which is usually the issue with biscuits and gravy!\n\nMy friend ordered the lemon corn cakes! When I tasted them, I immediately regretted not getting them. So for next time my order will be the best of both worlds = my meal plus hers. They have a lot of their meals in a 1/2 size serving... So when I go again, I will order a 1/2 order of the lemon corn cakes (for the sweet) and a 1/2 order of the biscuits and gravy (for the savory). \n\nThe thing I also really enjoyed is the cute environment and fun character! The restaurant is literally in a house - Adorbs!\n\nThere are few restaurants that I leave and am craving a few hours later... This absolutely was the case for three sisters!!! Round two please!!!!",

  "text": "The food item that I probably crave most often is a good burger. I really really really love burgers, so I was extremely excited when I realized Bailey's range would have another soft opening from Wed-Sun of this week. I was in a predicament though, the Cards game was on (which I refuse to miss) and when I called Bailey's the guy who answered was very apologetic in explaining to me that they don't have their tv's yet since they didn't realize the season would still be going on when they opened. He did however say that I could place a carryout order and they would have the food ready for me in 15 minutes. Sweet. I placed my order and by the time I got downtown and found a parking spot my food was ready. When I walked in, I was immediately impressed with the use of space. The decor was cute, unique and intimate. I was greeted by 3 employees within a matter of seconds who directed me to the bar where my order was waiting. The bartender rang us out quickly and was friendly as well. Everything smelled so delicious that the 5 minute drive back home seemed like a lot longer. Once we got home we dug in and were NOT disappointed.\n\nI got the Thai chicken burger which according to the menu is: ground chicken patty, shredded cabbage, daikon slaw, cilantro aoli, peanut sauce, lettuce and tomato. The chicken burger was super moist and the sauces complimented it perfectly. J got the blackened blue and by how quickly it disappeared I'm guessing he enjoyed it. We also got an order of fries (super delicious, seasoning was spot on) and I tried 2 of the sauces: honey mustard and rooster. Both were yummy but the rooster sauce is pretty thick and I probably would like it better on a burger. J tried the caesar salad which came topped with fried white anchovies. Of course I snuck a bite of his salad and I was pretty impressed by the flavors. I only finished about half my food before I was pretty full so I know I have something to look forward to for dinner tonight.\n\nOn a side not, one random thing I loved was instead of styrofoam all of my carryout items were packaged in 100% compostable containers (even the sauces!) and my order was packaged in a paper bag. \n\nI can't wait to go back and dine in so I can try that bourbon, candied bacon and salted caramel ice cream shake that's calling my name.",

This is just how Edmonton does pubs. Nevertheless, we go to Hudson's because it IS how Edmonton does pubs and since we are from Edmonton, we like that sort of thing. I have no complaints about this bar, but nothing to rave about it either. Hudson's is homey and tiresome, like your hometown is. You go there and complain that you should be somewhere else, but secretly you love the comfort of familiarity. Both of my younger sisters are servers at another location, and it treats them well, so I appreciate that. Thank you Hudson's, for being you, like a McDonald's for grown-ups.",

You can teel there has been considerable investment in bringing it to this level and there appears to be more to come.  \n\nThe overall conditions are as good as any other public course in the area with the exception of Seminole Lake and their unfair advantage of Paspalum fairways/greens, which are the envy of every other course in the area.  \n\nOverall:\n-6/10, practice area - pretty small but the mats are new\n-7/10, layout - one of the tightest around, but very playable since everything is well-manicured, nearly always making the penalty a punch out, versus lost ball.  Lots of water and the back 9 is brutally hard when there is wind.  Ends with a par 3, which is universally despised, but unavoidable in some circumstances.  \n-8/10, tee boxes - in great shape\n-9/10, fairways - just about as good as any you will find\n-7/10, greens - when I was there yesterday they had just been verti-cut and were pretty shaggy/grainy/slow.

This is my idea of an eclectic coffeeshop.  I remember when Rue de la Course is where the Rum House currently resides.  People were allowed to smoke and there were banker's lamps on each table.\n\nWell, Fair Grinds, you had me at banker's lamps.  Plus, they have an outdoor seating area which I have yet to try.  I'm a night owl so you won't see me out and about before 11am on a weekend unless I'm going to church or forced to leave puttering in my apartment.  Plus, bonus that they are open later than PJ's so I'm all about it!  I even ran into my favorite waitress from Nonna Mia there (ok so I eat at Nonna Mia alot to have a relationship with the waitress, manager, and other waiters! hehe).  She also gave me the FYI that Zotz on Oak is open even later if I can't get everything done in time.  Good to know!\n\nI also enjoy that Fair Grinds is located in the mix, it's on the same street as Cafe Degas, Canseco's, Maple Street bookstore, Swirl, and a salon that I haven't frequented yet.  There is street parking.\n\nAlso, the staff are friendly, there is only one unisex bathroom, adorable outdoor seating, free wifi, and a delicious soy chai latte!\n\nAm happy to have found a neighborhood! \n\nHappy coffee coffee drinking!",

Bread sticks needed to be cooked longer and were a bit plain tasting.  Salad was good and italian dressing was nice- not too salty.  Salad had grape tomato, pepper and cuke.

I love what the owner has done for 12 South, but this was not a great day for Burger Up.  My son and I both got Woodstock burgers and they were really good.

I love that they are kid friendly but clearly not going to deal with brats.  The bread is super amazing and our whole meal costs about $35.  So, you ask.....why the two stars?  Well....that would be the weight loss program they put us on around 7h later that evening.  We lost all the weight of eating there and then some.  I could feel the stomach rumble coming about an hour in advance and my stomach was still hurting after a long night for both junior and myself.

  "text": "Maybe just a bit of editing is needed\n\nBurger Study is 100% ok.  I went in hoping to be wowed, but sadly, I wasn't.  My first question came about when my friends and I asked to be seated, and were directed to the bar for our party of 5 instead of a booth.  That would have been fine, except for the two, empty six-person booths which went unoccupied during our visit.  The food was decent, but I think a few tweaks to the menu could really make things pop.  Plan for standard bar fare, with a few original items like fried avocado and beer-cheese tots.  The burgers are pretty to look at, but flavor-wise, no one in our party remarked on any stand-outs.\n\nFor decor, I went in expecting to feel like I had been dropped into an old library.  Sadly, the only library-esque decor I noticed was one wall with a few books which were artfully displayed.  I'd love to see a few more tomes showcased, and maybe even a menu dressed up to look like a leather-bound tome.  This seems like a concept that would be so much to play with, from a design standpoint.  Bookcases in the bathroom, posters of book covers on the walls, and many, many more books throughout the space seems like a no-brainer, and a sure crowd-pleaser.\n\nBurger Study is still fairly new, so hopefully, the management team will be able to work out the kinks (orders which were placed, but never received) and really capitalize on their great location and fun concept.",

  "text": "I have a lot of mixed feelings when it comes to sifting through my numerous Wasabi adventures. I used to come here all the time for their lunch and happy hour specials and the sushi has always been consistently good. There is a woman who works the sushi bar (I think she is the manager?) and she makes some BOMB sushi! She is possibly one of the best sushi chefs I've ever met. I actually used to get really excited when I came and saw she was working because I knew it would be a great experience. Joe, the bartender/owner is a super nice guy and he's great for a fun chat if you are feeling social and want to sit at the bar and make small talk. All in all...you would think I would have no issue with this place since I am clearly a repeating customer...HOWEVER...this place has a LOT of inconsistencies with their service. So many inconsistencies, in fact, that it makes it really hard for me to really endorse this restaurant in good faith. \n\nOrdinarily I would say the food quality at this place is 4 stars, but the service is consistently a definite 1-2 depending on the night. I haven't been to their other locations so I can't speak for them, but I might have just had one too many bad experiences here to come back in recent days. \n\nWe came in on a Saturday evening with a group of 4. My group rallied and ranked many nearby restaurant possibilities before leaving a nearby bar and I was actually the one who encourage them to come and try Wasabi. I hadn't been back there in awhile, but I was nearly certain they would enjoy themselves and at least love the food even if the service happened to be slow (as usual). \n\nWe sat down and it took them 10 minutes before acknowledging us (ok fair enough, seems like business as usual), and then another 10 minute for waters to arrive and then the server promptly left before we could give him our order, then another 10 minutes went by and he finally came to take our order, then 20 minutes went by just to produce 2 sushi rolls. We wanted to order more but our server NEVER came back to our table. He didn't refill our waters or ask us how we were doing or anything, he just dropped off the food and never came back. We finally just walked over to the sushi bar and told the sushi chef that we wanted more rolls, which his response was \"ok I get your server soon\" (the woman sushi chef that I previously mentioned was not working on this night). I kid you not, we were there for about an hour and half and all we could get out of this place were 2 rolls...and we were absolutely starving! Wasabi's service has always been pretty slow and unimpressive...but this was just ridiculous. \n\nWe waited and waited to close out our tab but he never acknowledged us again. Finally, we physically chased him down in an effort to pay our tab so we could just leave. Having worked in service industry jobs in my younger days, I would never condone a \"dine and dash\" method, but we were literally running after them with our money and trying to force them to take it so we could leave in good conscience. Quite honestly, I think anyone else with less bother than I would have just gotten up and left.\n\nIn our server's defense, the dining room was packed and there was only ONE SERVER in the whole restaurant (which is actually typical for this location but I guess I hadn't been during a packed dinner before to see how bad it could really get). Our server looked like he was sweating profusely and about to have a nervous breakdown so I didn't take it personally. But I DID feel totally embarrassed that I had convinced my whole group to go there and then they all had this absolutely atrocious experience.\n\nI don't want to totally discourage anyone from giving this place a try because for lunch or happy hour the service certainly seems much more tolerable, but avoid Wasabi at all cost if you have a group during peak dinner hours.",

I was in a hurry and hungry and it is Thursday Sushi so I figured I might as well give Ricks a shot and boy was I disappointed!!!\n\n1st, place was empty....granted it was 2 in the afternoon. \n\n2nd, place was a mess, sticky menus and dirty bussed bins in plan view.\n\n3rd, language barrier, I was trying to ask questions and no one understood me.\n\nOk, I could go on but let me get to my dinner.  I love my normal Mickey Nigiris and Upside down Shrimp it's basically the only thing I eat and it looked fabulous in its little to go container, and I get home all hungry and excited, get my sauce ready and my chop sticks in action to take the first bite and uggggg the tuna was so fatty I couldn't even bite through it....ok no biggie, maybe it's just that one, nope all 6 where layered with fat strands....and it had a hint on fishy smell. I was so disappointed!!! You can't tell me that the girl preparing them did not take notice??? \n\nI will not return AT ALL....and I will never, ever cheat on my favorite spot just down the street.\n\nIn all fairness, for those who might want to give it a shot, their prices where good and here is a picture of before and after and the menu....maybe you will have a better experience then",

Limited pullouts and parking along this road. Too hot for hiking but the scenery is outstanding for the rich variety of local cacti and wildflowers, set against the Rincon Mountains. The unique Saguaro Cactus is only found in the Sonoran Desert.\n\nThe Visitors Center is located outside the park gate with free parking. Wonderful short video, and informative displays provide an overview of the park. Rangers available to answer any questions. A must stop for visitors visiting Tucson.",

Yes, it's an older crowd, but that tells me the food is good and the price is appropriate, and both were true.  We called and asked if they could accommodate our party of three at the last minute, and were told yes.

We had a lovely, very traditional Italian meal with all the ambiance,  Dessert was especially wonderful -- the Tiramisu, with a touch of cinnamon, was superb.",

My mood instantly lifts when I come here - everything is just so pleasing to the eye and taste buds. \n\nThere are 3 separate sections in this cafe: beverages, sandwiches and salads. I've only ordered at the salad bar so I can't speak for the others yet. It's SO good and I've noticed that the majority of other patrons order the salad too. I get the BYO salad for $13 and they give you a huge portion so it's def worth it. I love how they chop up the salad in front of you which makes it taste so fresh and also easier to eat. \n\nI've seen people read and work here so it can be a nice study spot.

  "text": "I loved this place in so many ways.\n\nLoved:\n\n- the high ceilings\n-the well-lit space\n- the spaciousness\n- the bottle shop/bar concept, which New Mexico so desperately needs (Tap and Bottle owners, if you're listening, open one of these in Albuquerque. I'd quit my job to work for a place this great.)\n-the impeccable selection\n\nI'll deviate from my bullets to really comment on the selection. It was superb. There's a cask option, which is always a nice touch and it was cool that it was a beer, Jalapeno Cherry Bomb IPA from Dragoon, that not even the brewery had on tap when I was there the day before. The rest of the tap selection was a good mix of styles and local (Huss, Four Peaks, etc.) and national craft options. They even had a gose! Yep, goses aren't easy to find, but Tap and Bottle had a great representation of this German style courtesy of Destihl. I recommend it if it's on tap. \n\nThen there's the obscene bottle selection. Woosa! So many bottles to choose from. The selection here was better than Plaza Liquors! The beers were arranged by style and had many of the heavy-hitters of craft, Firestone Walker, Dogfish Head, Mikkeller, Tool, Sierra Nevada, Oskar Blues, and I could go on and on. The bartender was even so kind as to hip me to a great price on a Uinta beer, which I was able to get for $10 cheaper than it normally should cost. Gracias.\n\nThe pourers were also some friendly folks that seemed to know their beers and appreciate them. Also, the prices of pours were very reasonable, ranging from around $4-9. \n\nIf I lived in Tucson, I'd be in here everyday probably. I'll have to wait a few decades until I can make my millions and/or find investors to help make my dream of something similar happen in Albuquerque.",

We wanted to hang out in the city before she left. We've both never been here and was excited to try. Let's start with the takeaway: This place needs to get it together. I've never GIVEN A BAD REVIEW SO BELIEVE ME AS YOU READ. We walked in and it was immediately a 90 minute wait, that's fine we get it. They gave us the option to sit at the bar, which we did, but was difficult for my friend being shes very pregnant. We waited 20 minutes for a water and to have our order taken. Fast forward to an hour later. WE ARE STILL SITTING HERE WAITING on our food. While people beside us on both ends of the bar have received and eaten their food. Bottom line, our waitress forgot to put in our ticket. We are still waiting with our order not in sight. I'm livid. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant that is well known in the city. Did I mention it's Monday? I'm speechless.\nUPDATE: 20 minutes after I posted this review and still no food.

  "text": "If you want classic, South Philly Italian food, you need to go to Ralph's! \n\nI knew I'd love this place as soon as I walked in - it's one of those restaurants where you can dress casual or formal and fit in regardless. There's a nice ambience and it's cozy (coziness enhanced by a delicious glass of Merlot). \n\nI ordered the eggplant parm with spaghetti and a side of meatballs. The eggplant was amazing - meaty with a nice, crispy breading. The meatballs were also some of the best I've had (after my Mom-Mom's, of course). The simplicity of the meal really allowed each flavor to shine. \n\nObviously, I sampled my family members' dishes as well. Both of my parents ordered homemade pasta dishes - the cavatelli in gorgonzola cream sauce and the pappardelli with prosciutto and peas in an Alfredo sauce. Both pastas were amazing, but what really impressed me were the sauces - they were creamy but light at the same time! I loved that about them. \n\nFor dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - it came out like a slice of cake with the espresso-dipped lady fingers as the crust. It kind of reminded me of an Italian cheesecake, which didn't bother me but might disappoint some people (so FYI). I also sipped on some Frangelico, which was devine.\n\nIf you haven't been to America's oldest Italian restaurant yet, what are you waiting for?! All I can say is, I can't wait to go back.",

  "text": "As soon as I laid my eyes on my baked potato pizza visceral memories of my Sparty days at Michigan State University were evoked.  Baked potato pizza from Georgio's is near and dear to my heart.  So, bless you, No Anchovies for offering up, what is truly heaven to me.  Food is intimate- you touch it, taste it, smell it and the feeling it provides, bonds us to places and to one another.  I cannot recall the numerous times my friends and I bonded (usually around 3am, from late night cram sessions, not because of yard long skip and go nakeds, clearly) over a baked potato pizza.  \n\nUsually, when I tell people I love baked potato pizza they look at me quizzically.  I explain that it is a thin crust pizza with no sauce, sliced baked potato, green onion, loads of bacon, colby jack and provolone cheese.  I personally top mine with sour cream...No Anchovies tried this out but found ranch sold better.  They use redskin potato, I think I prefer a russet....but I am not complaining.\n\nSince I had such HIGH expectations, I feared a major let down....however, this pizza delivered!  Trust me go big or go home, get the 20 inch!  If you do not, you will be back in a few days to get more.  This is one pizza I actually like to reheat, actually the only pizza.  Warning:  A 20 inch pie will run you $25.25.....but it is worth every cent.\n\nSince I had a 40 minute drive home, I also got a slice of the hotwing pizza.  (don't judge it was 8 at night and I was famished) I love that you can order slices!  And I think the slices are large.  Usually, I shy away from chicken on pizza, because honestly, places rarely do not use precooked chicken...and the chicken is always off.  NOT HERE!  This was cooked with love....long and slow in the hot wing sauce until they could shred the chicken with a fork.  Ranch was the base of the sauce and blue cheese crumbles set this slice off!  I could have used a little more blue cheese- but I am a fromage fanatic.\n\nI was so bummed when I arrived because the patio was jamming (I ordered a carry out)...loads of people and their dogs were enjoying cocktails and pizza while relishing in the weekend, while being misted by fans....every near by patio was packed, most had live music, and the misting fans are the complete opposite of the patios in Michigan...we are batting away mosquitoes and crowding around heat lamps.  i cannot wait to bring my betrothed and soak in the downtown atmosphere....and more importantly get more pizza!",

  "text": "So finally after numerous visits to Brauhaus Schmitz I decided to get around to writing a review.  As I stood there amongst the circus that is south street on a pleasant fall afternoon I finally realized that this review had to happen.  Perhaps it was the beer or maybe the roasted pig, but something made me grab the trusty iPhone and draft a review.\n\nAs a restaurant brauhaus Schmitz is simple.  There is no real flair.  The menu includes what seem to be traditional German staples (various kinds of sausages, sauerkraut, awesome spaetzle and of course Beer) and the service staff has always been pleasant, well informed and very stuffed into their corsets.  I'm not sure if corset is the right word but I can appreciate the effect it has.\n\nIf you've never dined here you should go and get the wurstplatte.  It's going to be an easily approachable dish because it let's you choose you sausage type and two sides.  It's priced very reasonably and like I said before the spaetzle kicks ass.  It's buttery and slighty crunchy, ok I'm making myself hungry.\n\nMoving on, if you want a small adventure pre-meal I suggest the schinkenplatte.  It is a large board of meats, cheeses, pickled veggies and bread.  Easily split with a group of people or possibly housed alone if you're really getting ferschnooken (I made that one up Webster) it will not disappoint.  I believe I even had the black forest cake once and it was a very large, moist and decadent piece of cake.  Splitting that is a must unless you're the octomom.\n\nThe beer list changes pretty frequently and the selection is good both on draft and in bottles.  I met the owner at the Craft Beer Fest earlier this year and he was a cool man.  They had a special during the blizzard that we had in philly and he got cleaned out of his rochefort 10.\n\nI love this place.",

  "text": "So far, I have not been too impressed with the food trucks in Nashville. So, with no real expectations in mind I went over to The Hot Spot trailer while they were parked at Turtle Anarchy. I had never heard of them before this so with the 'deer in the headlights' look I approached cautiously. The person behind the counter offered some suggestions. Their Twisted Chicken, with Jamaican jerk spice and Asian hot sauce, it's Sriracha. I don't know why they don't mention it by name, it's like calling Guinness 'Irish stout from the St. James brewery.' I don't think I've met someone who doesn't love Sriracha so no need for euphemisms.\n\nAnyway, it was $7 for two big pieces of their chicken, spiraled with Sriracha and a separate container containing their fennel slaw. I've been similarly unimpressed with hot chicken but once I sat back down at the bar and opened the container it was a flaky, spicy, but still tasty piece of chicken. The hot chicken I've gotten was just heat but with very little flavor. The chicken, while sweat pouringly, mouth burningly spicy was still really tasty. I kept biting into it thinking 'oh man this is good' while wiping my face on my sleeves, careful to avoid rubbing my eyes with any heat. The random smoothness of the Sriracha with the spice in their batter was awesome. Their fennel slaw, was also really tasty with plenty of fennel seed in the mix and it was basically the only thing that could keep the heat down-too bad that there was so little of it.\n\nMy friend came later and I got her the patty melt as a belated bday dinner. She really seemed to like it and it's probably the only thing on the menu that doesn't have spice on it. He was even nice enough to walk it into the brewery when it was ready. \n\nHe eventually left because of the lightning that came in \"me in a little metal box with lightning around, I'm leaving\" and as my friend and I were thinking of eating again we told him how sad it was that he was wrapped up to go. He gave us what he had left, a huge basket of fries and three big pieces of chicken for free. He's changed my mind about food trucks and hot chicken, but more slaw please!",

There was a line when we arrived, but we didn't wait long.\n\nWe were greeted by the friendly scooper (not sure the technical term - but it sounds right?) who encouraged me to try a few different types so I got the ice cream I truly loved! \n\nI had a few samples and chose on the Pistacho and Honey.

Here's why I give it a 5.\n1.  Beautifully renovated old building which has been tastefullly renovated.\n2.  You get greeted by a genuine, smiling face as you arrive to claim your difficult to acquire reservation.\n3.  The waiter is a complete pro.  Immediate service without feeling pressured.\n4.  The waiter knows the drink/wine menu (and subsequently the dinner menu) like the back of his hand.  Has obviously tried and enjoyed all the wines...and can tell you why he likes or dislikes each.\n5.  The waiter describes the merits of the different preparations of each dish, and again offers genuine opinions on each (instead of the classic and soooo irritating, \"they're all good.\") And, he has great taste in food.\n6.  My food was awesome.  Easily one of the best meals in my memory.  The menu is creative and the preparation and presentation is amazing.  Grilled squid with lemongrass, followed by sea scallops with uni butter, stuffed romaine and Japanese mint.  Mouthwatering.\n\nPhiladelphia, you are one lucky town.  Hey Supper!

  "text": "I stopped in one very busy Friday evening and luckily got a spot at the sushi bar.  The service was great and the sushi chef really friendly.  A fairly extensive sake menu as well.  After reading the dizzying array of menu choices - they serve everything with 3 kinds of sauces, I finally ordered a scallop and a yellowtail sashimi, and squid stuffed with spicy tuna.  While everything was tasty, I have to say that the sauces really took away from the fresh flavors of the seafood itself.  There was just too much chipotle and jalapeno flavors trying to pass itself off in japanese cuisine.  I love peppers, but the thing I like most about japanese food is the simplicity of the flavors.  The chef agreed that one would find more traditional restaurants in Japan.  I like the choices, but I may just stick with traditional sashimi next time I visit.",

  "text": "Umami is a newly opened pan-Asian restaurant serving authentic Japanese, Korean and Thai food. I live in Chicago, but I go to Nashville often to visit family and friends (I stayed in Brentwood area), so it was nice timing for me to try out this new restaurant and I got to try a lot of their menu items with our group. They've got a great variety of dishes on their menu, and everything we had was delicious. You can tell that everything is made from scratch here, as well as using fresh, authentic ingredients. Here's my review on each item, in no particular order:\n\nKimchi fries: This is a fun take using a Korean classic (the kimchi) and an American snack (cheese fries). I loved all the flavors and textures on this dish: crispy hot french fries topped with ooey, gooey nacho cheese, sauteed kimchi, scallions, and a white sauce that I can only guess is mayo (or sour cream?). I will try to update this when I find out. \n\nKorean Fried Chicken: One of their more popular items (according to our server). You can select the soy garlic or the spicy sauce, or go half and half with your order (6 pcs, 10 pcs, 20 pcs, 30 pcs). I wanted my son to be able to try it, so I opted for the soy garlic. That did NOT disappoint! It's the perfect blend of that umami flavor that comes from soy sauce paired with the garlic flavor. It comes with a side of pickled radishes that is the perfect complementary crunch with your chicken. This is actually how fried chicken is served in Korea, and it's excellent. No need to travel all the way to Seoul!\n\nTuna poke: this is your classic tuna poke (pronouned poh-kae), which is a salad of raw tuna, cucumber and avocados. There were large chunks of fresh tuna, marinated and seasoned well (not overpowering the tuna or anything). \n\nSpeaking of fresh...can't get any fresher with the sashimi plate! We got a variety of sashimi to share, and I seriously loved every type of fish! If you're adventurous, you can try the freshly fried shrimp head if you order the sweet shrimp sashimi. The kitchen basically deep-fries the actual shrimp head that's taken off the body of the raw shrimp. For some of you, that sounds like something that could be shown on Andrew Zimmern's show, Bizarre Foods. But like he says on his show...if it looks good, eat it!!!!!!! Ahng!!!!! \n\nMango Tango Maki Roll: one of the recommendations from our server -- did not disappoint! I asked for this roll without cream cheese (I just do not prefer to have any cream cheese in any of my rolls) and it was not even an issue (I mention this, because some restaurants don't like to customize the maki roll orders -- \"no substitutes\" policy at those places). I don't think I've ever had a \"sweet\" maki roll before, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavors of this roll. The spicy crab and mango/strawberry actually went really well together. I'm glad that they can be inventive with their maki rolls, as well as serve the usual crowd favorites. \nSide note: I love the fun names of the maki rolls -- ranging from \"Pokemon Go\", \"Music City\", and \"the \"OMG Roll\" (I imagine this one will make you say OMG haha)\n\nKorean Chicken Tacos: You can choose from beef, chicken or pork for the Korean tacos. My son loves chicken, so we just went with the safer option (still delicious). I guess we could have tried the combo, I think that comes with one of each taco, maybe? This is also a very fun take on some classic Korean flavors with a little Mexican twist: the chicken has a Korean marinade, topped with Asian pickled radishes and cilantro, served in a warm corn tortilla.\n\nSeafood Ramen: If you're familiar with and (like me) LOVE the Chinese-Korean noodle dish called \"Jjam-bbong\", then you will equally fall in love with this dish! The noodles are obviously the ramen noodles, but in the spicy seafood broth that is used for the \"jjam-bbong\" dish. I can tell that they use fresh seafood for the broth, because it's spicy and refreshing, not fishy at all! I was actually thinking about this bowl the next day...and how much I wanted to eat it again. The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back to get this dish again!\n\nBeer Selection: They have an AWESOME beer selection, with some local and international beers. I love checking out local beers wherever I go, and the ones I tried were awesome. They also have some great ones on tap. \nFun tip: Order a large pitcher of beer, and it comes out in this REALLY fun pitcher that has dry ice and flashing lights -- so flashing smoke from your pitcher. It's not just for funsies, though...it keeps your beer nice and cold so that every pour is just as refreshing as the first.\n\nI saw a lot of people coming in for pick-up orders, so if you don't have time to sit down in the restaurant, you could always call ahead and pick up on your way home (or wherever you're headed).\n\nOverall, a wonderful meal and experience at Umami. Keep it up, guys! I'll be coming back soon.",

I like the sushi dish that comes on fire.  That always gets attention.   Pad Thai is really good food too.  \nTip:  Some of the rice dishes can be a little bland, so add a little sweet and sour sauce in order to build some more flavor.  It isn't your typical sweet and sour, and just a little really gives the dish more depth.\n\nI'd go there just for the crab Rangoon though.",

  "text": "Small froyo shop in the cute neighborhood off of Delmar and North & South. There were 2 vegan options: cinnamon and banana. I liked neither.  They had a watermelon flavor, but it contained dairy. WHY??!! The kids loved their flavors, which included salted caramel, chocolate, and cheesecake.  They offer 2 cup sizes here: large and larger. So no matter how little you put in even the smallest cup, it's gonna cost you $5. I'm not a fan of this money-grabbing practice.\n\nI hear that they rotate the flavors often, so I wouldn't be against returning to see if they have more appealing vegan options next time.  However, in general, they are over-priced and would not be my first choice for dairy-free dessert. \n\nAlso, if the cramped little parking area on the side of the building is full, there is more parking in the back, off of North & South.",

  "text": "Went to Goat Hollow last night for dinner with a friend who lives in Mt. Airy. Atmosphere was great - rustic, love the wood stove (would imagine that it's very warm & welcoming on a winter night). We sat at the bar, bartender was attentive, my martini was excellent and she kept an eye on my friend's wine glass. We ordered the charcuterie platter (currently kind of obsessed with them) and a large house salad to split. The salad was fine, but I was somewhat surprised that they didn't split it for us (especially given lack of space at the bar). Slightly overdressed and could have used more goat cheese. The charcuterie platter was disappointing to say the least! The cheeses (I believe there were 3?) were cut into such tiny slivers that you could barely get a decent feeling for the taste/texture. The prosciutto was fine, there just wasn't much of it. There was no explanation of the cheeses OR the meats, and a couple of the meats were... difficult to discern? A terrine of some kind? The pickled veggies were good, as were the cornichons (but those likely came out of a can, as did the whole grain mustard). I believe we received 5 pieces of bread to go with the whole thing. Needless to say, we both left hungry. \n\nOn a positive note, another patron at the bar ordered the smoked salmon board, and it looked delicious - we were both jealous and drooling over the plentiful portion of salmon and pile of bread. Why so stingy with the meats & cheeses, Goat Hollow?",

It has an industrial feel, but is still warm. \n\nI order my beloved caipirinha (Brazilian cocktail made with cachaca, muddled limes and cane sugar) - something you don't see on menus often in Indianapolis. I've also tried the passion fruit caipirinha and didn't love it nearly as much; lime is the way to go. If you want tequila, the carriage house margarita is very good (careful, they creep up on you).\n\nBrussels sprouts app is amazing - charred and topped with cotija cheese and lime juice. The empanadas I've had were good but a bit bland. I've had empanadas at two authentic Cuban restaurants in the past and they had more flavor. I know that there are different interpretations of empanadas depending on where you go, but these seemed moreso Americanized. \n\nThe Red Drum entree is amazing. Just get it. \n\nChurros very good.

This is somewhere you want to grab a meal and catch up with your people.\nSecondly - the menu is fantastic.  Coconut Cilantro Rice?! I HAD to get the tortilla bowl when I saw coconut cilantro rice, I love all of those things.  But the menu had beef or chicken..well that wasn't going to work.  So I asked if I could sub shrimp, and you know what? They did it! They did it and it was AMAZING.  It was also as big as my head and fed me for multiple meals.  Sabrina (who came out and checked on me!) does an amazing job layering the flavors.  You can taste everything in its own right and it all blended wonderfully.  \nThe customer service is phenomenal, the food is wonderful, the prices are more than reasonable for the portion.

I can easily say that their glazed donut is probably one of the most disappointing donuts in New Orleans (which is coming from a girl who has been to 9 donut shops in one morning to taste test every single glazed donut at each). So you aren't going for a Classic - you're going for the fancy-pants, bigger than your face donuts that they roll out each day. And they're good! Especially when you get a flavor that's right up your alley (for me that's the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, YUM).\n\nBut what I really love about District is not their donuts - it's their coffee and other food items. Their coffee rocks my world. I get a hot Americano, and you can just immediately tell that it's quality coffee. I appreciate that so much. I've had their iced coffee before too which is great! I've been really wanting to try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee, so hopefully that'll happen soon.\n\nAnd then you have their sliders, breakfast options, cinnamon rolls, and more. All of it is great. The cheese and egg biscuit is to die for - melty pockets of cheddar cheese, perfectly salty egg, and a soft but crunchy-on-the-outside biscuit. Swoon.\n\nTop all of this off with the fact that the employees there are always so kind. They engage you and are excited for you to be there.",

The richness is due to high butterfat and egg content and minimal air.\n\nImportant term:  \"concrete\" - the frozen custard equivalent of a Dairy Queen Blizzard, you pick your mix-ins and they blend it up into decadent goodness.\n\nOne of my favorite items at Ted Drewes is the Christie, which is actually a sundae:  a brownie, frozen custard, hot fudge, and caramel ($5).

Terry, was Server as well as a bartender too. I had the rum punch, it was already made, not strong, and my friends had a different sweet punch drink. Terry, was so funny, warm gave me two shots, loved his New Orleans accent, and whenever I come back I must go back to try the food, and hopefully fun Terry will still be there.",

  "text": "My first visit, the restaurant is located off Main Street, good location, you'll have to park in the parking garage behind the building it's always hard to find parking on Main. The decor was very nice,  open concept with a bar and great patio section. My best friend arrived before I did and she stated it took a while to be waited on, but we will cough that up to the fact that they looked a little short on staff and every establishment is experiencing the same thing due to the pandemic. Once we did get a server it was pretty nice from there on. The restaurant offered a really great happy hour menu, I ordered the bourbon brown sugar wings, the wingettes were nicely sized and perfectly cooked, a lovely wedge salad with a very tasty lemon drop. My bestie enjoyed their whiskey and wine flights a salad and some really good fries. I definitely will be back and highly recommend this place, of course their busiest day is on a Friday since that is the day I went but I'm going to return earlier in the week. Good vibes, good food and staff, great music, nice patrons.",

I ordered them and about 15 minutes later, the party in my tummy was ON. Pictures are up, and they actually do give the plate justice. They were served with home fries and although I love me some potatoes, I hardly touched them because I was so into the benedict.\n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly and melted all over the chicken which had a good crunch and was very tasty. The waffles were warm and gave the entire table an aroma that had them gazing at my plate, and though I offered to share I was secretly hoping no one would take me up on the offer. I left extremely happy and full and ready to walk the entire meal off or I'd have to pop the button of my pants off. I highly recommend this place for brunch, but do be mindful that it is cash only!",

They have areas where you can plan soccer or basketball or so many other sports. \n\nThere are roads where you can basically go for a walk and circle the entire park. There's a section where there are benches and it's covered so there is plenty of shade and restrooms! It gets REALLY windy though so be warned.  The kids playground has a variety of things to play with for the younger and older kids. The downfall is that it is not covered.  The bigger issue I have are the large ant piles (most likely fire ants) which I am deathly allergic to. What if one of the kids walk through it by accident? One of my bigger fears.....",

We also tried to rare ahi tuna appetizer, and it did not disappoint. The sesame crust was absolutely yummy. \n\nThe wine list was quite extensive and we started with Stag's Leap \"Hands of Time\", a very bold Cab. The only downside was that they only had 1 bottle of it on hand. We instead ordered a Sangiovese from Midnight Cellars, and that was satisfying as well. \n\nI tried an 8oz. filet, rare, Oscar style, and it was very good. I could not stop eating it. \n\nI capped the night off with a \"turtlelized\" cheesecake with Maker's Mark caramel, pecans, and chocolate sauce.

  "text": "I want to like this place more, I do, but I've had a few experiences here that are less than perfect. \n\nThe first visit, I was full of giddy. Ready to try this new fad of nitrogen ice cream. When I ordered, first thing I noticed was the artificial flavoring pumps. Ok I get it, you can't have a ton of flavors from scratch if customers don't order it. Fine, totally understandable. But my issue wasn't with the flavor on this visit. On my first visit, they were so busy that they had to douse my cream in liquid nitro not once, but twice! The person stationed at the stirring area was helping the cashier, and thus my ice cream began melting, so by the time he saw it, he has to freeze it again. I didn't think anything of it until I tried it. The result was a lack luster artificial flavor with ice crystals worse than ice cream from your local freezer aisle. Ick. I'm not made at the stirring guy for helping his coworker, just disappointed that they didn't realize the texture was off and still willing to charge so much for it.\n\nBut nope, that didn't stop me. I went another few times, and while they never had to refreeze my ice cream again, I just couldn't get over how sickeningly sweet the flavors were. None of the ice creams had that yummy, small batch, oval ice cream shop feel to it that I love. Honestly, I'd rather to go Handel's or Brics any day of the week. \n\nIf you love sweet ice creams or just want to try nitrogen ice cream, give it a shot! They're not bad, just not great.",

Great booths, chairs, and a super cute area around a fireplace. I would love to curl up with a book, some drinks and some eats in front of it and just hang out. \n\nOf course my friends, the Gs, are the new foodie place ambassadors, and I got to go with them for lunch today. Service was great. Water was kept filled, we got new drinks when we needed them, and the food came out fast. We sat around finishing drinks and talking at the end and weren't rushed. We got to meet the owner, Kathleen, who made a point to come to talk to us and discuss the menu and more. I always appreciate it when the owner or manager makes an effort to talk to me. It makes a personal connection and shows they care. A big difference! That alone was really impressive. It was nice that she wanted our opinions on menu items.\n\nI loved my drinks - a boozy mocha and a non-boozy chai latte. Yum! \n\nFor food, I got the cheese a saurus, basically a grilled cheese with pesto. It came with chips or fruit. I was disappointed it didn't come on a popover so they brought me one anyway (and didn't even charge me for it!). The sandwich had great flavors, but the bread wasn't toasted (like it was put in an over instead of a toaster). I would've liked that better. The herb popover was yummy! I also got to try the hummus that Tim ordered. It was REALLY good. Lots of feta and a nice tang. I would order this without a doubt next time. With popovers. And just eat that.\n\nThere are several vegetarian options between small plates, salads, breakfast items, and sandwiches. They also have veggie soups that aren't on the menu that change, which I'm excited to go back and try.\n\nI really loved everything about it here and will be looking for an excuse to come back ASAP (ahem, Megan A!).",

I also learned they serve \"nachos\" which are waffle cone pieces surrounding a massive scoop of ice cream topped with hot fudge. One of these days I'm going to order the farmhouse - 8 scoops and unlimited toppings!\n\nI recommend the honeycomb, cookies and cream, and I recently tried rough seas (candied nuts with honey swirl and pretzel). I think some flavors are only available for a limited time because I didn't see my beloved cowboy cookie. \n\nThe only thing I can (barely) complain about is that their handmade waffle cones are thin and fragile.

  "text": "Finally I can eat something besides falafel, gyros, or cajun food at the Farmers Market!\n\nI go to FM a lot for lunch because the other options in Metro Center are fast food.  Thus, you get options and, if you have a group, everyone is pleased.  So when I heard that Arnold Myint was going to open up a spot I was excited.  Real food, likely healthy, likely fresh, likely the tastiest thing in the place - what's not to love. \n\nSo I showed up with some coworkers who weren't as adventurous as me and went to another place.  That's the great thing about FM!  Anyway, I perused the sides and decided I really wanted some curried quinoa.  The sides come in little small containers although I think you can order larger (like think large enough to take some home for the family).  I picked out a turkey sandwich and also got a bag of the homemade chips.  Verdict: loved the quinoa, wish I had gotten more.  Sandwich - ok, better than Subway of course, but still it was, in the end, just a turkey sandwich.  Will bust out with a different choice next time!  Chips were yummmy.  I also liked the iPad checkout station where you just sign your name right on the screen - a little oasis of class in the craziness of the Farmers Market.  I also got to see Arnold Myint himself which was cool because I totally rooted for him when he was on Top Chef!\n\nDefinitely give this place a try next time you are at FM having lunch.  You will leave pleasantly filled with healthy food and will be the only one not in a food coma at work later that afternoon!",

We called in our order, and were told it would take up to 20 minutes for our lunches to be ready for pick up. My friend Colleen, opted for healthy Fresh Thai Shrimp Spring Rolls for a waistline friendly starter. I'm in love with any thing ginger, so I got the Ginger Chicken. Colleen and I shared both. Also, we got Supreme Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice & Coconut Cream, one for each of us.\n\nUpon my arrival, I was standing at the host desk for a good five minutes, no one came to help me. Then, the first person I saw, failed to greet me, and when I went to the desk to let the host know I was there to pick up my order, he totally did brushed me off, and was unpleasant!!!!  Have you just looked at someone and automatically felt annoyed? I did, and all what I'm saying is that host/hostess have to mind their p's and q's. \n\nMy lunch came out after SIXTY minutes and I went \"Ba Dum Tss!\" \nBesides the bad customers service, the food was just okeyish. The fresh spring rolls were too healthy and tasteless, like fresh grass. Totally off-putting!\nThe Ginger Chicken I ordered, was described in the menu as ( Sautéed with cashews nut, onion, scallion, bell pepper, carrot in chili paste and light garlic sauce.)\nThe ginger had an overwhelming kick to it, and there was no sign of any spicy chili paste! Also, absolutely NO cashews in there, or scallion. There was no flavor, and no tongue's satisfaction in that dish whatsoever! \n\nHow can anyone mess up a very simple dessert like sticky rice?!! My order of Supreme Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice & Coconut Cream  was a failure. The rice was incredibly sticky, stiff and hard to chew. Enough said!\n\nObviously I will not be returning, not only because of the below average food, but also because of the poor service and unpleasant staff.\n\nTwo Yelps!",

We walked in and found two seats at the bar, like winning the lottery. I was looking forward to trying this place because friends say they like it. We started with the fish spread. Sorry I just was not impressed. Very typical. The music was so loud that there is no chance of having a conversation with whoever you are with. My boyfriend on the other hand said he did like it and made him feel like he was on an island somewhere. We split the blackened grouper sandwich. It was a nice thick piece and I must say it was very fresh.  I guess this place was just not my cup of tea but I'm sure the tourists love it.  I did feel like it was overpriced for what you were getting and they seemed under staffed.",

  "text": "I love me a good beignet, and what better way to enjoy a weekend than munching on some delicious, warm beignets at a park, with jazz music on a beautiful day. \n\nI'm so glad I was also introduced to this location as this had less of a line than the one at the French Market. It was also an added bonus that it was inside a beautiful park. \n\nThe line on a Saturday morning wasn't awful. We waited about 10 minutes to place our order and was served almost immediately. It's a little bit challenging to find tables here, but you can definitely choose to enjoy the beignet on a park bench or on the grass if you'd like. \n\nThe beignets are best when served warm and are worth it! They're the perfect treat for your weekend!",

  "text": "I love the Nancy Bru beer here.  That said, this place has the most unusual location of any Brewery in the city.  Kind of behind Home Depot in a semi-industrial area.  Walking in the front door is just like any other bookstore, but the fun is around the corner.  This is small batch brewing, smaller tanks and tighter space for the Brewers, but the bar area has plenty of seating for patrons.  Gaming is popular here and encouraged with a nice selection of games on hand.  \nThey brew a lot of beers here and have them available for growler fill and by the bottle.  They offer a nice food menu, but I usually just come for the beer.  Once I shared a sandwich and it was awesome, so I can only assume everything is first rate.  The staff is great here, they work well together and make it a pleasant experience.",

They have a good amount of outside and inside seating. I didn't get to take in the water views but it is located right along water. And being this is a seafood place I had to try the seafood lovers platter which includes shrimp, scallops and grouper which I had fried. The food was much better than I expected and I was not disappointed at all. I will definitely be coming back to enjoy the drinks and views and the pretty good food .",

  "text": "GF and DF Review:\n\nTonight was my first dining experience at Convivio in Carmel, IN.  This place was jumpin' on a Wednesday night! Got there at 6 pm and by 6:45 it was packed.\n\nThe restaurant is relatively new and tucked into a strip mall at about 115th St and Illinois.  With such prices, I did not expect babies and toddlers to be there, but they were.  So, if you want a high-end (cost and quality) dining experience (and don't mind a strip mall in Carmel, then this place is great.  \n\nOkay, about the food.  I had the salmon and shrimp special (w/o the cream sauce) for $27.  My friend had the boar ravioli.  She love hers and I liked my dish quite a bit. \n\nWe were not rushed to leave once we finished our meals.  Very nice! This is true dining.  If you are in a rush, you might want to find another place -- great food is not created in seconds!",

  "text": "Thank you for a lovely morning!  I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \n\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\n\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\n\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).  Bonus points for the server agreeing not to judge my decision to get two breakfasts.\n\nAll around, I loved this place and hope to go back soon.  Long live the Jersey diners!",

  "text": "The new Han Dynasty took over the spot where the old Mid-Atlantic restaurant (with the unchanging menu) was. I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.\n\nNote though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.\n\nNext, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3.",

I have to admit they have so many great appetizers choices it was hard to choose.\n\nHowever, I ordered the CV signature margarita for my cocktail along with the LA Crawfish Beignets per Lindsey's recommendation, and they both were soooo delicious. I was a little skeptical about the beet mixed with the margarita but it was hands down one of the best margaritas I've ever had. So handcrafted. My cousin also ordered the Brussels Sprouts and Cajun Carrots and they were delicious and flavorful. I've never enjoyed having veggies as an app before. For my entree, I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Benny and they did not hold back on the jumbo lump crab meat there was more than enough for each bite. My cousin ordered the Gulf Fish Amandine and wow what an entree it was. I had the chance to taste a bite and let's just say I will be ordering it the next time. \n\nOverall, I loved the entire brunch experience. The atmosphere was perfect. We were able to sit outside amongst all the many plants in their beautiful courtyard and the bathroom was also picture worthy. Great experience, and I can't wait to go back!",

  "text": "Why 2 stars? Because our experience was pretty poor.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nAfter researching all of the pet resorts in Tampa Bay pretty thoroughly, we felt really good about leaving our dog at Camp Bow Wow while we left town for Thanksgiving. My girlfriend used to drop her old dog off at the Brandon location, and she loved it. Plus, the Tampa location is super convenient on our way to the airport. \n\nI asked the guy who checked us in, how much time is spent in their kennel, vs how much is spent out playing. He said that they are up at 6am to eat, and 90 minutes after eating, they are out playing all day long until dinner time in the evening. Making sure that our pop receives plenty of exercise, and is not being locked away in a cage all day was very important to us, and the primary reason we went to a \"pet resort\" over an old fashioned kennel.\n\nOne of our other favorite things about Camp Bow Wow, was that they have webcams in all of the play areas, so that you can check in with how your pup is doing all throughout the time that he is there. Well, we certainly did check on him a lot, and it was pretty alarming what we found over the course of his 4 day stay.\n\nWe checked out the cameras about 15 times, at all different times of the day. 8a, 10a, 1p, 3p, etc etc. The dogs were out playing twice out of the 15 times we looked. \n\nSo when we picked him up Monday morning, I asked about that, and this is the answer I was given:\n\n\"Yeah... we had some new people working and a lot of dogs here, so we got a little behind on the schedule.\"\n\n\"Behind on the schedule\" is definitely an interesting way of saying that the dogs were out playing maybe about 10-20% of what we were told. I could understand if instead of them being out at 8am on Thanksgiving morning, things were pushed back an hour or two. Or maybe an incident where a clean up pushed things back 30 minutes. But to tell us our dog will be out playing for 8+ hours a day, and in reality, he might have been out playing for 8 hours combined over 4 days.... that's pretty unacceptable, and I don't think I'm in the minority saying that.\n\nAnd to make things worse, he acquired kennel cough at Camp Bow Wow, which was also lovely. That was not an inexpensive trip to the vet.\n\nSo needless to say, we had two upcoming vacations that involved our pup heading back to Camp Bow Wow, but those were immediately cancelled, as soon as we found alternatives.",

  "text": "I completely adore the vibe and interior of DOSC. \n\nWalking up the stairs and turning in, you're welcomed into the split space of cafe and dining. The light airy side of the cafe, molded from the exposed brick wall down to the velvet upholstered lounge chairs transitions amazingly to the dining sace. The dining area has more of a masculine feel, with dark leather couches playing with bold colored feature walls. The wooden beams with the additional eclectic brass piping features along the ceiling and the bar...Each detail comes together into  mismatched perfection, resulting in such a cool space. \n\nWith my schedule playing i've only had time to make it down for their brunch. Basically got a chance to try everything- giving you guys a pretty good idea on what my take is on this space brunch wise. \n\nNow, service every single time i've been has been amazing. The servers are always so personable and friendly. They know their menu and aren't scared of  recommendations, which I'm super appreciative especially when trying new eateries. \n\nFood summary- As much as I love their space and detail to design. I really was expecting more from their dishes. With more misses than hits, presentation being the biggest aspect lacking for me. If not the the aesthetics and the vibe I dont think the I would have been back as much as I have been. \n\n\nCarbonated Fruit Cake - ($5) - The weirdest yet most impressive dish if id have to choose, the after taste is straight sizzly carbonation, baked into the pineapple sponge.Taste was okay, wouldn't order again though.\n\nMillet Porridge with Mango Fresh Berries - ($6) - A play at oatmeal with some added fruits to make it boujee. This was surprisingly filling and made me feel super healthy ordering. - But honestly having oatmeal and rolled oats at home.. could you really justify spending 6 dollars on it? Eh. \n\nButtermilk Stack Pancakes - ($7) -  The coconut cream is the biggest part of why I loved this dish so much I'd order this again for sure.\n\nPrime Rib Hash - ($14) - The first dish I tried, and the best so far out of all my visits was this dish alone.The meat was super tender and the paired brandy brown sauce, YES. Scoop up a little bit of that mash and you've got yourself a perfect bite. \n\nCrispy Pulled Chicken - ($13) - So deceiving; I read crispy and automatically was drooling for something satisfying like fried chicken but what was brought out was something close to resembling bird food with a side of extra dry strings of chicken. Nothing else to say but, pass. \n\nSteak and Eggs - ($15) -  probably my second favorite dish out of the brunch items I've tried. They know how to cook their steaks -lemme give them props to that. Portion was surprisingly big as well. \n\nCountry Sausage - ($3) - 2 Choices and we opted for the chicken cranberry sage combo, taste was unique and yummy. Came with 2 small pieces of sausage. \n\n\nDOSC also ended up being our NYE2019 place of choice and I got some cocktails to try.  The French 1914($13) and the Ryes and Shine ($13) -I'm a pretty big cocktail fanatic, especially when they look pretty and these...looked pretty. Taste was waaaaaaaaay too strong. Didn't end up finishing mine and ended up just getting chardonnay after. Food was just like brunch visits. With only one dish standing out and presentation lacking as a whole. \n\nHopefully things improve as they keep updating their menu. Will still give them another shot because I'm absolutely smitten with the aesthetics.",

Needless to say, I had a better, more fulFILLING time at the buffet - $10 for all you can eat AND naan?! Come on.. you can't find that anymore. Maybe $7 for lunch at the Chinese buffet, but what is in that stuff, anyway? \n\nI tried almost everything there, and I wish I could remember all of the names. I tried paneer for the first time, and although it was a bit too spongey to be cheese for me, I really enjoyed the spices and broth that it was stewing in. Also had saag something or other with chickpeas in it. I love anything with chickpeas and spinach, so this was also very good. I tried the Lamb Rogan Josh - EXCELLENT! With a bit of rice, I ate all of this up! My favorite Indian food, though, is still chicken tikka masala, I feel like I am cheating when I say that, but my boyfriend is Indian and it is his favorite, too, so maybe I am not. At Palace of Asia it is a very thick sauce, but the chicken is cooked well, and when mixed with rice and eaten in the naan, it is delightful. Not too spicy either ;)\n\nI tried the gulab jamun, not a fan. Definitely too sweet for me, and I have a hard time with fried food. Bad enough Indian food is made with so much oil! It's ok every now and then, perhaps I should try more vegetarian options next buffet.",

I had a caterpillar roll. The Salas was so good I had 2 of them. Well my family helped me. \n\nMy family had the rainbow roll and some other traditional rolls. \n\nI had a honeydew me martini.

I like that it's slightly off the grid, but it's also not hard to navigate to from the interstate. It's the perfect pit stop.\n\nThe BEER:\nThe beer is fabulous! Their IPA is my favorite. \nYou can build your own six (or four) pack and take as much as you need to go! This was perfect for traveling back up north, because I have a lot of beer drinking friends that wanted to try from this specific brewery. I didn't take the tour, but I'm sure it would have been great, as the staff was so friendly and attentive. \n\nThe FOOD: \nAh-mazing. I haven't tried everything on their menu, but based on the 3 plates that I sampled, I would confidently say that no matter what you get, it's going to be great. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere is fun, the beer is top notch, the food is great, the staff is friendly, the bathrooms are CLEAN...\n\nthe only thing that left me scratching my head walking out the door was.... why didn't they already have some sweet tea brewed? Ha! I expected to fill up on some good sweet tea in my last southern stop going back up north and was surprised when they pulled out the simple syrup to pour in the unsweet tea. Is it just me? Either way. WORTH IT.\n\nDefinitely stop by. You'll LOVE this place.",

It's oozing with Brie. No seriously I have dreams about it. The staff are all friendly and the service is prompt. I love just going for a drink at the bar too - the bartenders are great. They actually talk to you if time permits which I personally appreciate. Their beer is delicious, they have a great range of IPAs, lagers, ales, etc. I highly recommend iron hill!! Christopher was a great server the last time I was in and one of the managers, Sonia, was also amazing!!\n\nEdit: still love this place but I have to let everyone know that I highly recommend joining their king of the hill club. It's a $15 lifetime membership with a dollar per point system and you get a $20 for every $200 you spend. You get 150 points for signing up. You also get your beer served in larger mugs for the same price, 1/2 price growler fills on certain days, double points days, and access to all sorts of events!!! It's an amazing program!",

The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. \n\nYou can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.\n\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  \n\nIf you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.\n\nLove this place!!!",

  "text": "Warning: this review is a bit of an ode to my love for properly made grits. I may go overboard. \n\nThe location is great. It is in the heart of downtown near the convention center and near the Hertz office where we rented a car for the day. \n\nOur server was so nice and helpful. As I have mentioned in prior reviews, I have a myriad of food allergies, most of which are at issue in Louisiana cooking: peppers, chilis, potatoes, and tomatoes. As a result, I could not order any hollandaise options off the menu because it is made with hot sauce but she walked me through the menu to show me what I could eat. I got a breakfast combo with eggs, grits and bacon; my husband got the omelette. \n\nThe eggs were OK but the grits.... these are not run of the mill grits that are instant. These are the grits that I had when I first fell in love with them in September 2001, also in Louisiana (Shreveport). Fluffy yet smooth with a slight hint of butter. So delicious I ate my husband's portion. Diet be damned!\n\nService was very quick and just delightful. My husband left his camera on the table and she chased after us to return it. \n\nWe will go back again later this weekend. I don't care if I should experience more of New Orleans. And I am going to buy a T-shirt. And yes, I am fan girling all over this place.",

  "text": "I almost did not write a review for Vetri. It's the kind of experience that leaves you speechless. From the beginning to the end, every dish was divine and the service's attention to detail was stunning - Vetri represents the pinnacle of Italian cuisine.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for our 8:45pm reservation. The dining room was running a bit behind, but the maitre d' made all guests comfortable by promptly greeting people as they walked in, taking coats, and offering glasses of prosecco. Once we were seated, an enormous platter bearing four different types of hor d'oeuvres arrived, and we met our server, Diana, who explained each type to us with a clear passion for the food she described. All were delicious, especially the salumi.\n\nAfter our first delectable bites, Diana returned to explain the menus and to discuss wine. As others have mentioned, Vetri's menu is full of choices; however, it is best enjoyed by perhaps choosing one or two items you must try, and leaving the rest to the discretion of the chef. I was impressed by how personalized each menu was - we did not all receive the same dishes for each course, which I loved because we got to trade bites! Also impressive: Diana did not take any notes at all during the menu selection and everything came out perfectly. When one member of our party agonized between the dover sole and the quail stuffed with foie gras, Diana and the chef went above and beyond by making sure that everyone at the table got to try both.\n\nEvery dish was excellent - our favorites of the evening were the sweet onion crepe with truffle sauce, the kale ricotta gnocchi and the ravioli stuffed with aromatic almond risotto, the dover sole accompanied by capers and a light tomato sauce, the wonderfully al dente mezze rigatoni with duck ragu, and the almost overwhelmingly decadent quail with foie gras. The desserts were excellent as well - I especially enjoyed the fluffy and creamy cannoli cake and the tangy lemon tart. At the end of the dinner, I was left in awe of how each dish was so spectacular individually, and yet the whole meal had a lovely flow and cohesiveness to it.\n\nDiana was also extremely helpful when it came to the wine list - she was able to describe the particulars of each wine and really made every single one she talked about sound appealing. One member of our party opted to do the wine pairing while the rest of us shared a bottle. However, Diana felt that our choice would be too heavy for our first course, so she gave us a pour of a white wine that had been aged in stainless steel. I've never been to a restaurant before where the server, recognizing that the choice of wine might detract from a dish, opts to bring out a different wine for that course. The attention to detail was just incredible. Other standouts (as relayed to me by our wine pairing member) included a red wine aged in cement and another red wine that was a mix of \"playful grapes\" from central Italy. \n\nThis review is now much too long, and yet I still feel like I have not conveyed how incredible this meal was. At $155/person (plus wine), Vetri is one of the more expensive dining options in Philadelphia, but they certainly make it special. To enjoy such an intimate, personalized menu of such high caliber, and to encounter probably one of the best servers in the city all in one dinner was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",

  "text": "Wow.  Not sure if it's too soon to say, but Angela sure is somethin' else.  I think my search for my go-to psychic has ended.\n\nI went in somewhat doubtful and unsure of the process (Can someone really just, have visions?  No other physical media iex: cards, shells, etc.??).  But, her method of intuiting metaphorical visions and then interpreting them to you is actually a refreshing change from the tarot card readers I've been used to--I found our session to be quite detailed and clear, thus leaving me much more satisfied.  She's honest, accurate, and blunt, but keeps with a relaxed energy that makes you very comfortable.  Honestly, I'd love to hang out with this woman--she's just down to earth and funny, like an old friend.\n\nShe was so on-point with wording my life situation that I cried (very unlike me).  You just don't realize how misunderstood or lost you've felt about something until someone perfectly crystallizes it.  \nI'd say the reading was probably 85-90% accurate regarding the present/past, and I can update if her predictions do come to pass.  I was amazed at how she continuously filled in the details through her visions that I had forgotten to mention.  She will take the words out of your mouth.\n\nA small example from my session was me asking why I hesitate and struggle to improve my skills, and Angela received a vision of a specific loved one (with accurate description) covering my throat chakra, thus interpreted as them quieting my voice and holding me back.  I realized she was right.\n\n  I could then ask how to remedy the situation [if it wasn't immediately shown by the guides], or Angela would send a theoretical scenario and relay to you what the outcome would be.  She not only interprets your current situation, but offers guidance for moving forward.\n  Other visions were more detailed, some more or less metaphorical, some literal future visions, but that's the basic jist of how the session moves.  It's very interesting.\n\nYou can ask her virtually anything: career, love, family, health....Hell, I even asked if I should get a pet dog with our extra time.\n\nIf you are hesitant due to her pricing, I'll tell you I was, too, prior to seeing her.  However, the hour experience was so helpful that I've deemed the money completely worth it.   You can also record the sessions, and I highly recommend you do for future reference.\n(*She also offers 20% off for your first time!)\n\nUnbelievable.   I'm grateful to have found her, and look forward to seeing her again in the future.\n\nUPDATE: A couple of Angela's predictions have, indeed, come true.  Go see this woman.",

On cold nights I've sat upstairs which has a bar and feels like a beautiful lodge with the tall ceilings!\n\nAnd on those warm nights I've sat around the mismatched tables listening to live music, relaxing with friends while trying a new white wine, cheese, and small plate. I really can't think of a better way to spend an evening besides relaxing by candlelight and various white lights with friends and loved ones around. If you know me well you know that I can be very territorial and if I like a place I will NEVER take a date there bc I consider it mine! And bacchanal is that kind of place! Hehe it feels like a little piece of heaven right here in NOLA. \n\nThe people that work here really know their libations and will pair your tastes for the perfect cheese, tasting plate etc. I have brought various kind of friends and even the one that went to culinary school at Johnson and Wales and used to work at Emeril's was impressed with their wine selection. In fact we selected a wine that he said he couldn't find anywhere else in NOLA. Score one for bacchanal! He was also impressed by their small plates and the homemade concoctions in the bar upstairs!\n\nSo if you want to relax somewhere and be amongst friends then come over to Bacchanal. You won't regret it! As other reviews have said this is like being in a friend's backyard. It's eclectic, homey, and endearing like the Bywater always is!\n\nHappy carpe noctum!",

  "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally got a chance on my 5th wedding anniversary! While I take my baby son out to many restaurants, this isn't the kind of place I wanted to spend a bunch of money at and have to worry about him. So we came child-free. We made a reservation, which was a good idea. It was packed! We were seated upstairs, and as some others mention, it was LOUD. It didn't help that one party seated near us was quite obnoxious - to the tune of everyone turning around and staring. While it wasn't a romantic ambiance, it was still an enjoyable meal.\n\nWe started with the roasted cauliflower and the fries with ketchup and aioli. Both were delicious. The cauliflower came with golden raisins and gremolata. The fries were thin, salty, and had delicious dipping sauces. We cleaned our plates and washed them down with beer (him) and pineapple agua fresca (me). They have a huge list of wine and spirits here, and even a sommelier. I'm abstaining from alcohol currently but my husband enjoyed his pour. We continued our meal with the burger (him) and ratatouille (me). He enjoyed the burger with more fries, though said it was a little unimaginative. I LOVED the ratatouille. It had penne pasta, eggplant, zucchini and summer squash in a red pepper tomato sauce and lots of cheese. It came with a huge nest of arugula on time, which I removed (yuck, my least favorite green). I wanted to lick my plate. The flavors were intense. I'm not even a huge fan of eggplant unless it's very well prepared, like here. We finished with desserts, the pumpkin tart with maple ice cream and the oat financier cake with caramel apples and creme fraiche. Both were again, amazing. The oat cake was so flavorful and moist, perfectly complimented by the apples and creme. My husband almost didn't want us to order two to share because he was so full, but he couldn't stop eating them either. For two drinks, two apps, two entrees and two desserts, the bill was about $75 before tip. Not bad at all for this quality of meal. \n\nService was on point all night. They have a lot of staff and seem to take somewhat of a team approach. I saw many people delivering food and helping out other than servers. We rarely had empty water glasses or dirty dishes on our table for more than a minute. \n\nOverall, a great experience and I will be back. They start serving brunch soon and I plan on trying it. Hopefully the crowds that we saw also enjoyed it and it stays around. Great addition to Maplewood!",

  "text": "4.5 rounded up. Super charming and chill place. Easy to make a reservation online and we were the only ones there when we arrived. Soft Italian music playing, and the door was open so we could hear the rain and the cars go by, adding to the ambiance. The proprietor (host plus waiter and maybe owner)? was quiet and kind. BYOB is inherently fun and cost-effective and there was no corkage fee. The bread that comes out at the beginning is SO GOOD. Warm focaccia-like bread, and a lot of it. Comes with great olive oil with balsamic already drizzled in it. (Pro for me, con for hubs, but he still really enjoyed the bread.) The entrees came out pretty quickly. He got his usual chicken parm and I tried the Capellini Johny Rocco, which was an olive oil/tomato/spinach/garlic pasta. Both dishes were a solid 4 out of 5. Not the BEST pasta I've ever had (it was maybe a tiny bit buttery, which isn't my fave), but it was really warm and comforting and indulgently olive oil-y. Next time I would try the clam linguini with red sauce. The red sauce linguini that came with the chicken parm was good and had a unique orange tint, like a vodka sauce though it didn't taste as such. Towards the end of our meal a party of loud guys came in, and it's a small place so we could hear their entire conversation, so that was a tad less charming, but I don't fault the place for that. Baby loved the pasta and the vibes as well. Also, the portions were large and we had leftovers to bring home. This is a really nice small business and if we lived in Philly, we'd come regularly.",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because this is definitely a place I want to visit regularly.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nEver since missing the Yelp event hosted here, I have had it on my list to check this place out. My first experience was very brief as I found out he did not receive his shipments in due to the threat of a hurricane, so he was out of all fresh food from the deli. Of course, this was totally understandable, but I do wish there was some kind of posting on social media about that because I even checked their Facebook page ahead of time to confirm that they were open.\n\nBut I waited a couple of weeks and returned. There were a few sandwich options but I was told that the menu would be changing in a few days, so I'm not sure what's currently available as I type this out. I opted for a Cuban sandwich and browsed the products while I waited.\n\nThis Cuban was just a bit different than any other that I've had. I think the main difference is that it was only moderately pressed, which left some softness to the bread and did not completely melt the cheese to act as an adhesive to hold everything together. While I was a bit thrown off by that at first, I came to realize how much I enjoyed the sandwich as I continued to eat it. \n\nI also was able to buy a few local brews here. I love Pumpkin Beer and picked up some cans from Brew Bus, Big Top and Tampa Bay Brewing Company. They pretty much have every single canned beer made in the Tampa Bay area here, so you any beer lovers will be all set with this selection.\n\nFor all the delicious snacks in here, I do wish that there were some chips available. That was the only thing missing with my sandwich, but the sandwich itself was a home run.\n\nOn my next visit, I ordered a pizza with prosciutto and mozzarella, which was enjoyable, but I liked the Cuban Sandwich even more. There are a couple other sandwiches on the menu that I would like to try on future visits.",

The server picked up on his resistance and quickly brought him a plate and cutlery without us even asking. I loved how attentive they are here. \n\nThe food is fantastic. We had the snow crab legs and the lotus root which were all brought to us hot and steaming in a plastic bag. You eat with your hands on the brown paper covered table. It's a kids dream. You do get really messy. That's part of the fun. We did get the mild spice, which was a bit more spicy than I was expecting so be aware of that. \n\nThe scissors they provide are super easy to use and can get into everything. Way way way better than Red Lobster ever was.",

  "text": "We had my birthday dinner here and had been excited to try this new hot spot out for a while. We were seated upstairs in a nice spacious dining area. The atmosphere is upscale casual and a bit romantic. It's pretty low key and quiet with a lot of couples and business associates dining out. It's definitely not a place to catch the game or have a wild night out. Our waiter was very knowledgable and friendly. I was very pregnant at the time, so he informed me that they had alcohol free wine - score!!! I love wine and I haven't been anywhere that served alcoholic free wine. It was sweet but oh so delicious. We had the corn bread starter and hummus, both were delicious. For dinner I had the pork chops. I never would order them, but the waiter said they were a favorite, so I went for it.  I am so glad I took his advice because they were phenomenal! The sauce was surprisingly different, more of a cream based sauce and it was fantastic. My fellow diners had the steak, which was delicious, but everyone who tried my dish said it was the best. Someone else had the spaghetti pasta which was good, but not over the top special in my book. Dessert was outstanding with flavors of cashew pudding topped with bourbon whipped cream. The chefs here are really creative, mixing up traditional items with a twist that makes them both memorable and delicious. Two thumbs up for Reeds!",

It's Olympic lifting, it's gymnastics, it's crazy stuff that I had never done before and now I'm hooked. It's not a gym in the traditional meaning, it's coach led classes. \n\nThis place is great. I shopped around and went to many of the other St. Louis CrossFit boxes and fell in love with the staff, the support, and the people here. The location is brand spanking new, it's super clean and organized, and the people are so helpful and supportive. It's like I found a family of people who push each other to do their best. Cheesy, but totally true. \n\nThere are free intro classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm or call and see if they can do a free private session (that's what they did for me). It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny.",

  "text": "I recently visited B&M for a fourth time and ordered my usual B&M Burger and Truffles fries. This time, I ordered the cheese board appetizer and an extra order of truffle fries -- because, why not? My original review was four stars out of five, but I have to be fair... this place is five out of five.\n\nThere is a bit of exclusivity that this place seems to give off. They have hours between 4:30 to 10 (or 11?), and they don't accept reservations -- they accept \"call-ahead seating.\" Once you arrive at the designated time, you'll have to wait somewhere between 15-30 minutes for your actual table, but the servers are very attentive while you wait. I found the servers to be very knowledgeable about both the food and the wine selection. \n\nWord-of-mouth has certainly given this place quite the attention and for good reason. B&M has one of the most delicious burgers I've ever come across. And while I commented earlier on the size of the burger, I have to say that the size is probably \"just right.\" Their truffle fries rival that of Ciro's, and my mouth waters just thinking about how deliciously crisp, salty, and flavorful that they are. \n\nIf you haven't yet explored B&M in DTSP, you're missing out. This is especially the case if you're a \"foodie.\" Don't come here expecting your standard, American restaurant fare, though. And also don't come here expecting to get \"filled up\" at this restaurant, unless you order several plates. The point of this restaurant is to introduce you to the idea of \"craft food.\" Food snobs will swear by this place, but general food lovers - like myself - will thoroughly enjoy the overall experience.",

  "text": "Good Dog is a great go-to in my neighborhood.  Whenever a friend comes to town and we don't wanna go OUT-OUT on a Friday night, this bar is always there with good food and drinks and just up the block.  Great burger - who doesn't love blue cheese oozing out of the center of a delicious beef burger?!  Mixture of sweet and regular fries is a nice touch, too.  Their food is consistently good for \"pub fare\".  They also have salads with goat cheese and shrimp...so you can eat healthy as you down your Sly Fox beer!  \n\nThe downer here is that it's tough to get a table at times, and it's a mix of drinkers and diners...so if you're looking for a place to have conversation, it's small in there and can get quite loud if you're next to loud boozer-types.  At the same time, it's a bar!  The music is fun and upbeat.  I highly recommend Good Dog as your go-to when the next blizzard rolls into town (hopefully not until next winter).\n\nApparently people like to play Quizzo here, so if you come on that night, you might have to vacate early for Quizzo ressies.  Nerd alert! :)",

They were subtle and kept us comfortable the whole evening. The beer list was not extensive, but had a good variety. For our meal, I had the cast iron octopus. It is served salad style on dandelion greens. The greens had a strong flavor, but it was balanced by the glaze. The octopus was terrific. The pickled mussels were a unique touch to the dish. My boyfriend had the P&K cheeseburger and he thoroughly loved it. I picked at his french fries that came with the burger, and the fries were delicious. He asked for bacon on the burger, but it arrived baconless.

It was about 11.45 on a Saturday and they hadn't turned their \"OPEN\" sign on yet and the parking lot was empty.  We decided to give it a shot.. and ended up there again the next weekend!\n\nI couldn't decide between the pork or brisket, but finally settled on the brisket as my wife got a pork quesadilla.  The brisket was cooked very well.. it didn't fall apart and it had a good smoke ring and taste.  I would have loved to have a couple burnt ends, but I can manage without.  I had some mac n cheese, which was good, but nothing amazing (I'd take more meat and no sides any of the week)\n\nAtmosphere is cool with a race car in the back half of the restaurant.

Now, more than 15 years later, I still love that juicy steak like it was the first time I tasted it. Instinctively, I always go with Victoria's Filet, a Loaded Baked Potato, and a Caesar Salad. I usually get a Fosters, Australian for beer, to wash it down. And when I am feeling extra greedy, I will start off with a Bloomin' Onion. But if you do that be careful, those Bloomin' Onions have been known to ruin an appetite or two.\n\nI have been to this location a few times. The staff have always been professional and friendly. I have never had any problems. The food is usually speedy. I have dined at the bar and in a booth, service is good at both. The only complaint that I have is the parking lot. It is not large enough for the crowd. Luckily, it probably keeps the wait times inside to a minimum. \n\nIf you love steaks and you are stuck up about them, then Outback's chain steakhouse menu may not make you super thrilled. But if you love steak and can put up with the chain vibe, then you should really like Outback. It is my favorite chain steakhouse. That being the case, I love coming to this location because this is where it all started! This place is like the Ancient Greece of Outbacks!",

Desire's sister restaurant, Begue's, was my family and friends' favorite brunch in New Orleans.  And for years it was a well kept secret: $30 for bottomless champagne, an amazing creole buffet and a beautiful dining room over looking the Royal Sonesta's verdant courtyard (this unusual oasis actually has orange trees (!!!) and one drunken Thanksgiving a friend won a bet that they were real by scaling eight feet, in high heels and her best Chanel, to pick one - the little old ladies in hats and familial wait staff gave her a standing O when she alit, prize foisted). But Begue's became a victim of its hubris, raised prices to almost $50, chased off the locals and closed with a whimper.  Thank goodness they didn't ruin Desire!

  "text": "I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the \"wrong\" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. \n\nWe came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. \n\nWe got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!\n\nWe also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)\n\nThe ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!\n\nBy the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon.",

I mean who doesn't love downtown southern food right? \n\nWe arrived right around 8pm and the restaurant was completely empty inside. It was a typical bar look inside with wooden booths and dim lights. We chose to sit outside since our was a nice night. We sat for about 20 minutes before somebody came to take our drink order. This should have been the indication of how slow service would be smh\n\nFor appetizers I ordered the shrimp and anchovy toast which the toast was burnt but the shrimp had a decent flavor. My friend ordered the country pate which was bland and not enough bread for the pate. My cousin ordered the biscuits and gravy which was the only good tasting thing. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the shrimp gumbo which was decent in flavor but needed more spices. My friend ordered the country fried chicken which was crispy but flavorless. My cousin ordered the braised beef short ribs which were very salty. We were far from impressed. \n\nFor dessert I took the recommendation of the server and ordered the whiskey brownie a la mode. The brownie was stale and so hard. I could have gotten a better brownie premade from the grocery store. \n\nSo the slow service with the mediocre food will cause us not to come back to this place.

  "text": "Wow, Mr. B's is awesome! Although at first we were put in a crappy table next to the kitchen, which we moved from before we ate, we ended up in a great table, albeit with a not so friendly waitress. Seriously, this chick looked like she hadn't smiled in about 10 years. \n\nRegardless, everyone loved everything that they ordered, from the eggplant sticks and salads, to the steak. lamb chops, and mahi mahi. And speaking of my dish- it was a mind-blowing, drool-worthy pasta, which tasted like it had liquid smoke in it. It was such an amazing blend of smokey vegetables and perfectly al dente pasta that I could eat it every single day. \n\nTo finish we had the bread pudding and profiteroles, which both rocked my socks off. If we had our original waiter, this would have been a 5-star review.",

  "text": "This is a great inexpensive hotel.  When we arrived Friday afternoon they were just starting a wine and cheese hour!  What a treat!  We were quite excited.  They also have complimentary breakfast every morning....another bonus.  The rooms were good sized and the bed was comfortable.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  There is a pool and a hot tub, all looked very clean and inviting.  There are lots of tables/umbrellas/chairs,etc all around the pool.  The rooms came with two complimentary waters which we were more than happy to take advantage of.  They even give you chocolates on your pillow!  Oh, and free internet too!  \n\nThe rooms were very clean and I love when the sink and mirrors aren't in the bathroom so that you can get ready when the actual bathroom is being used.  One tip......the website will give you a AAA rate even for a weekend reservation but if you call the hotel directly they will tell you you cant get the AAA rate.  We booked it online with the AAA rate no problem and of course the hotel honored it.  It is REALLY reasonably priced.  Right across the street from the ocean and some of the rooms have an ocean view. Walking distance to State Street.  This place is a real find!",

  "text": "What a great place for Indy train lovers.  It's even sweeter as a Christmas holiday outing.  We took our 5yr old grandson and he loved it.  He loves trains and drags out ours & builds it on our large table every visit.  He was just the right age because he knows that they're not toys to touch.  He stood and watched them for the longest time, especially his favorite with the waterfall.  They are still adding and I'm hopeful it will continue to expand with many more.  It's worth an hour or two of your time and you can pick up a bite of lunch while you're there.  Make sure and not miss it next year!",

  "text": "Pretty good.  Had the guacamole and chips  for appetizer which were tasty.  My entree was the shrimp enchiladas with a very creamy chipotle sauce.  They were decent, but the sauce a bit rich for my taste.  The serving size was very big, 3 enchiladas, so I brought one home.  I liked the refried beans, but didn't love the rice.  The desserts were not good at all.  Their flan was all wrong.  How can you mess up flan?\nI've been several times over the years and the food is always pretty good.  I have yet to find good Mexican in or around the Philly area.  I'll keep trying, b/c eventually someone is going to get it right.",

  "text": "I took my parents here while they were visiting Tucson last month and they were shocked about how similar the cuisine is to Indian food. I've had it before and had a feeling they would enjoy it and of course they did. I love their shiro and all of our dishes were very flavorful and some also had a nice spice to them. We were also checked on several times throughout our meal. I like that they give you small portions of dishes you did not order as \"sides\" in addition to your entrees when they bring you your platter. I was glad I got to try almost all of the dishes on the menu since we got a few extra tastes. The injera was a little soggy compared to other times I have had it, but I wonder if it was a one time thing or just a different style.",

Lüke (like a few other places) had popped up in many searches and recommended by many fellow yelpers).... \n\nOn our flight from Florida I locked in a reservation for a rather late night dinner (enough time to travel to our hotel, unpack and grab a pre-dinner drink... On the flight I also checked out the menu and pictures online and was impressed but was not expecting find more than one article rating Lüke as serving one of the best burgers in Louisiana... \n\n10 pm reservation on a weeknight and they were packed but our table was ready for us upon arrival.  The place is bright with impressive wood features like the eat-at bar and table partitions... the floors are should be for walking but they were drawing my eyes down to see the tile and wood inlay floors. The lighting fixtures and tin-ceiling tiles added to the charm. I also loved the way they displayed their seafood selection in a cold section at the bar.\n\nI was very much in the mood to eat traditional New Orleans dishes like Shrimp 'N Grits or Étouffée, but I kept thinking of that burger so I went for it.... \n\nThe Lüke Burger was legit.... bacon (glazed I believe), caramelized onions, tomatoes and emmenthaler cheese (I never heard of it either)... very pleased with my decision !\n\nI also managed to steal a bite or two of their Shrimp 'N Grits (En Cocotte) which was absolutely spectacular !\n\nAlso enjoyed a Sazerac before dinner... they did New Orleans righteous with the city's signature drink",

  "text": "Great experience each time I'm here. Service is always good, and the food even better. Super fresh seafood. I personally love the uni and crab. I've had both their box and rock crab. The box crab is tastier but more expensive. The crab is served with onion rings. I just wish they served my crab with the tomalley. The uni is served on top of scallops and slices of lime. It might just be me, but I think the uni tasted sweeter in the winter. Regardless, still good now - certainly better than uni you get on a tray in a market due to freshness. My recommendation is to get local seafood. Why get seafood that has been shipped hundreds of miles when you can get something fresh from local waters? Support local fishermen maybe. It's also better for the environment. They have tables inside and outside. There is usually a wait if you come at peak times or with a large party. Consider adding your name to the list and going for a short walk around the pier as you wait,  or go during off peak times. Parking on the wharf is free for the first 90 minutes. There is also street parking near the wharf if you're up for a walk and if you can find an open spot.",

I got a Chicken Tinga taco and a Yazoo Dos Perros Decker taco.\n\nThe chicken tinga one had chipotle & onion braised chicken, avocado spread, a house crema, and jalapeños (which I had to take off bc they were too spicy. But, hey, I still got the cool aesthetic colors with it so that's all that matters right?). The Yazoo one had Yazoo braised brisket, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo, horseradish crema. Both were AMAZING but I really liked the Yazoo one better. As you may know in my previous reviews, I'm a brisket kind of guy so I naturally loved it better.\n\nWe also got an order of the avocado fries, served with a morita ketchup, which was absolutely delicious. A definite must with your meal.",

  "text": "Came here for an early dinner on a Sunday evening, not too many tables were taken, but given the time I went I can't give a great indication of how busy they get at peak times. \n\nHaving never tried mullet I knew that would be the move given how well known they are for it. My server gave helpful instructions on how to go about eating around the bones, as my carnivore habits probably would have led to me swallowing a few bones without it. \n\nThe mullet tasted super fresh and I loved getting a variety of textures and levels of fattiness between the different sections of the fish. I didn't find it too difficult to navigate around the bones, but if it's your first time eating around smaller bones like this I can understand how that would detract from your experience. \n\nThe German potato salad that comes on the side was also super delicious. It had a nice light mustard flavor and just the right amount of creaminess. \n\nThe dish came with two homemade horseradishes, they both tasted good but felt out of place with the fish and potato salad. Perhaps the combination isn't for me bur I could definitely see it going well on a sandwich. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend this spot if you're visiting the area and looking for some seafood you likely won't be able to find back home!",

  "text": "Pretty good food and if you eat a lot you can get your money's worth.\n\nI'm usually not a huge eater.  Two rolls for me is normally more than enough.  So when I come here, I have to expect to eat more than I'm comfortable with to get my money's worth.  However, for my husband, who is a huge eater, this is a good deal.  Therefore, this is a place we'll come to when we are both super hungry, but otherwise I won't be able to eat enough to make it worth it.\n\nAt 7 p.m. on a Friday it was completely packed.  We got the last table!  By the time we left at about 8 p.m. there were tables open again.\n\nService is fast, which is great!  At the Saki in Tampa, it took forever to get more food.  Here, it came pretty quickly.\n\nMy husband started with the salad with ginger dressing.  He said next time he'd skip it.  There wasn't enough dressing.  I got the Crazy Roll and the White Dragon Roll.  I liked the Crazy Roll best.  Their rolls are on the small side, which is good since you'll want to try a bunch.  Both were pretty good, but I noticed the rolls tend to lack the sauce that usually take it to the next level at normal sushi places.  I also got the salt and pepper calamari.  It was perfectly seasoned.  I loved it, but since I had to eat the whole thing by myself, I found it a little greasy by the end.  I finished with the green tea ice cream.  It lacked a strong green tea flavor, but it wasn't bad.  My husband tried chicken, shrimp, and steak hibachi.  I found the meat dry, but he liked it.  The fried rice, wasn't bad, but you could see the bits where they missed mixing in the soy sauce.  \n\nI enjoyed how you could get 8 pieces of sashimi.  I got salmon sashimi and it was good. \n\nThis place can be very hard to find.  Luckily, I saw it off of US Hwy19 so I had a general idea of where it was.  My gps took us in the general area, but then left us to figure it out.  It sits off of US Hwy19.  As long as you know that, you should be able to find it.",

  "text": "This Publix is by far my favorite publix!!! Not only is the staff nice and helpful, but they also do a exceptional job in the deli. There subs are wonderfully made and all there deli items are delicious and wonderful, especially their buffalo chicken dip, There meat and seafood section is also fantastic; I love that I never have to question the freshness of their seafood, meat, and poultry, unlike some grocery stores I've been too. Publix is more expensive than some other grocery stores like Winn Dixie and the now defunct Sweet Bays, but It's certainly not as expensive as Whole Foods and Fresh Market. Of course I have to say Whole Foods has a superior produce section and Fresh Market has a better Meat section and that's why their prices are higher than Publix. Having said that I would still go to Publix because it is closer to my house and I really enjoy their deli section. Also their cakes are fantastic. I'm proud to say I love their Teddy Bear cakes because they can make them for any special occasion. So if your heading to Honeymoon Island or just live in the area, stop at this Publix.",

I started with the peppercorn ranch salad and it is to die for. How could it not be, with all my favorite stuff - bacon, parmesan cheese, ranch dressing? All the ingredients are so high quality. You can tell. I also like that it comes pre-mixed, so you don't have to sit there and spew salad all over the table trying to mix it yourself.\n\nI love that you can order any of their salads as a side salad and you can order any of their specialty pizzas half and half. This time I tried half Edgar Allan Poe (olive oil, mozzarella-fontina blend, mushrooms, roasted garlic, kalamata olives and goat cheese, tomatoes and parsley) and half of their seasonal pizza, The Cuban, (mustard base, mozzarella, pulled pork, pickles, Canadian bacon, mojo sauce, swiss cheese). Both were great and I liked having two vastly different varieties side-by-side.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say, my favorite from Dewey's is still the plain-old pepperoni. Apparently I have the palette of an 8-year old.",

  "text": "Just wanted to do a quick review of yet another place I've been wanting to try. First off, for some reason, I thought this place sold like custard and cream pies. But they don't. So after I calmed down and wiped my tears, I checked out what they do specialize in. And what they do specialize in, is a small assortment of soft serve type Ice Cream in about 4 or 5 delicious flavors like the Ube and Thai Tea that we tried (I'm now a fan of Thai Tea. They also have pretty witty names for their flavors too) served in a plastic sundae takeout thingy. It's served over your choice of chocolate or vanilla cake cubes  and you can choose your choice of sauce like strawberry or condensed milk etc. You can also add a couple pocky stix to your sundae for a small charge. We chose the green tea stix I believe it was. \n  All in all, I give the taste a 4.01584. I really thought I'd easily like the Ube better but that Matcha Tea surprised me. Wasn't sure about the vanilla cake, but when I got to it, it was soft and moist and tasted good under that  ice cream. I mean, cake and ice cream, can't go wrong. For our sauce, we chose the condensed milk. I love condensed milk on my shave ice back home and theirs was very light and not overpowering. The negative I have, was that the price seemed a little high to me. About $6 - $7 each from what I remember but, aside from that, we enjoyed it.\n  Just wanted to say a big Mahalo to the owner, sorry I forgot your name. Great customer service from when we walked in until we left.\n\n                 Cream shaboogie bop!",

I love that they serve their beers in mason jars. \n\nCharming Wit: Nice alternative to all the super hoppy stuff most breweries are doing these days. Almost floral, very fragrant. Easy to drink!\n\nCharming Shandy: Man! This is going to be delicious in the summer. A bit overly citrus-y for my taste, but refreshing and one will be nice when it's HOT outside. \n\nWhat I didn't try: Grapefruit IPA, because they were out. \n\nOrganic Lemonade, because it's non-alcoholic and I'll leave that to the kiddos. \n\nThe large and almost barren warehouse space provides seating on picnic tables. There's a \"kid area\" with a chalk board and games/crafts. In door bathrooms, which is always a nice convenience. \n\nThey take credit cards via square (you can have an open tab). They also sell growlers and merch, like t-shirts. \n\nThere's plenty of parking on the side street. \n\nThe one MAJOR complaint I have is that there's a large fan and it's ridiculously loud. I mean, you cannot have a conversation loud. I bet the cool air will be nice this summer though!!",

You start in the foyer, move to the parlor, move to the indoor room that was outdoor at one time and then into the kitchen. Our tour was interrupted three times by the bell. There has to be a better way for Campbell House Museum to handle this.

CASH ONLY!\n\nI really enjoyed my breakfast, I went out on a limb and ordered a NOLA take on huevos rancheros and was not disappointed.  My companion ordered typical eggs, meat and grits.  He didn't love his - but I think because he didn't try something new.  \n\nThe diner and the staff are all about personality. Clearly it's a locals kind-of place.  The only odd thing, was the incredibly loud argument the line cook was having with a dishwasher about how hard his job was and how nobody could do it better than him.  Hmm, everyone in the restaurant could hear the argument, and frankly some folks were a little scared at the decibels.  A little off-putting to some, interesting albeit to me.",

  "text": "The fiancé and I selected Tayst as our 2 year anniversary celebration spot for dinner. Since we lived in Hillsboro Village, we have dreamed of the day where we could walk through those doors off of 21st and have a wonderfully romantic and divine culinary experience. Perhaps the anticipation and our expectations were too high. I'll break it down for you:\n\nThe Pro's:\n1) The service. From the reservation to the to-go box, Tayst has fantastic employees. We had a reservation made in advance then had to change it to 20 minutes before we arrived and Sarah, the hostess was completely accommodating (not to mention pleasant). Our server John was polite, friendly, and enthusiastic about our meal and it showed by his attention to our table. \n\n2) The decor. Tayst is a very nice restaurant and is decorated appropriately. A cream colored curtain hung elegantly on the wall, capable of separating the dining area into two distinct spaces. Further the dining area was comforting and warm with the brown hues. \n\n3) The wine. I loved the wine selection and the overall organization of the wine menu. It was hard to settle my decision on just one wine. The prices ranged from $7-15 a glass. \n\n4) The menu options. Variety and inventiveness of flavors were much appreciated. The pumpkin bisque was practically sinful ($6) and the pork cake ($9) was also delightful. \n\n5) The philosophy. Self renewing and focus on local food producers.\n\nThe Cons.   \n1) The price. I realized that we were in for a beating in terms of price but reflecting on the experience I don't think it was entirely worth what we paid. We could have easily had a steak and roasted chicken dinner somewhere else for at least 25% cheaper for just as much atmosphere and flavor. \n\n2) The wait. Upon ordering, it felt as if it was an extended period of time before our entrées arrived.",

All my purdue friends are all about HotBox pizza, and my IU friends (or husband) cant stand HotBox. I dont discriminate my pizza, either you good pizza or you suck, this is one of the better pizza joints if you want something pretty fast. I usually go for the 10\" Porky the Pig which has pepperoni, bacon, sausage and ham on it, all meat all the way. I usually get a side of breadsticks as well and a coke to go because I love collecting those cups. That's the main reason I go, I love the cups, they are so useful for so many different things.

The tacos are good, but don't really strike me as the best value for the price.\n\nThe service here is hit or miss.  I've had some really great servers and I've had a couple who were just not super nice people. I don't need a Peppy Pollyanna to bring me my drinks, but I also don't want to feel like I'm in trouble when I order food.\n\nIf it weren't for the tiki bar, I might give La Rev three stars, but that outdoor patio is everything.

As stated, there is no meat in this establishment, but that doesn't stop them from having some delicious Indian food anyways. Came here and got a lunch special of the Paneer Tikka Masala(which comes with a veggie samosa and your choice of naan or rice), along with the Mushroom Bhaji with rice. Everything tasted great and for lunch the paneer lover's platter(which was the aforementioned tikka masala, samosa, and naan or rice) was a great deal at $10.\n\nSome issues still stand; Apparently rice doesn't come with their meals normally and with the random sides here and there it can get a pricier than you'd expect. But that aside, the food is delicious and the portions we have had were plenty filling. For a wide selection of vegetarian options, I think I'll be back.",

We agreed this is def one of the better Indian restaurants we have been to in the area. What made me love this place even more is that after we left I realized I left my phone on the table.

The cup cakes were fresh and lovely in her display case, each one marked with a Heart, noted a filled one. All cup cakes were $1.50 save for the canolli cup cake and that was $1.75 because it was real canolli filling and a bit more expensive to make. \n\nThe shop smells wonderful upon entering. It is a bit no frills but over all, that's fine. It's the product that you're looking for. The cup cakes are small, but GOOD. Moist cake, good icing, not too sweet but very tasty. The husbeast had the blueberry filled one, and he said it was amazing, I opted for the Salted Caramel cupcake and it was DELICIOUS. \n\nI will come back when I'm by this way again.

Since one of us had to stay with the baby in the hotel room, we decided to see if they would do steak to go...and they were so accommodating and packed up everything perfectly.  So a big plus there!  As some places do not do \"to go.\"\n\nSo this review is strictly for the food, as we did not dine in.  However, the bar area in which I waited for our food was lovely and the bartenders were so attentive and helpful.\n\nFor appetizer, we ordered the Shrimp Cocktail, Onion Soup Au Gratin, Escargot, and Steak Tartare.  The Shrimp Cocktail was fresh and huge, four to an order!  Loved the fresh grated horseradish...made all the difference!  Onion Soup Au Gratin was just so-so, it was a bit on the salty side so we actually ended up pouring it over the steak as seasoning.  The Escargot and Steak Tartare were just perfect...both were perfectly seasoned and prepared well.  The escargot was piping hot but no rubbery and the Steak Tartare was rich and balanced.\n\nFor entree, we shared the 18 oz Delmonico.  It was a HUGE piece of meat!  While it was done perfectly, however the meat itself was pretty standard, nothing to write home about.  Don't get me wrong, it was a still a beautiful piece of meat, but we had just come from a fabulous steak house the night before so the bar was set a bit high.  \n\nIn all, the appetizers get 4.5 stars, the steak gets 3 stars.  But the fact that they were willing to pack up a meal for me to go boosted them to total of 4 stars!!!",

Another good sign is that it is very clean.\n\nMy friends have been talking about how this place had the best peanut beef sate pho and had to take me to it to try it.

Apparently this is their most popular dish ($12).  I do admit, the broth was very spicy and I loved it.  Maybe I've been spoil from my fave go to pho place, Co Do Hue, where you get ample meat in the pho, but I did find this lacking in that area.

She created an empire.\n\nI first discovered Sprinkles back when I lived in Chicago. When it popped up in the Gold Coast, I had some doubts but the first bite made me a believer. When it popped up in 12 South (again, great location scouting), I was thrilled to check out the opening and fill my belly with all sort of cupcake (and ice cream!) wonders. I was so so happy.\n\nAnd then I developed a gluten issue.\n\nFor a fatty who loves cake, brownies and beer, this is definitely no bueno. There have been a lot of businesses I have had to say good-bye to in the time that's passed since my body revolted against Frankengrains. But of all the sacrifices, my dessert black hole hurt the most. The sweet cut is the deepest. But it came to pass that I had a guest in town and she wanted (needed!) to check out Sprinkles. Being the consummate host, I obliged but I was already jealous of the happiness she was about to experience while I had an air sundae. We walked in and were greeted by the typical cheery Sprinkles staff (kudos to whoever hires and trains). Off-handedly, I asked if there was anything available for someone gluten-free. I expected a 'oh, poor you' face, head tilt and a no. I received a 'yes.' Wait. What?? There was a gluten-free red velvet cupcake I could go to town on or I could avail myself of the chocolate chip cookies. Even better: I could get either (or, both) with ice cream.\n\nStaahhhhpppp it. This changes everything. Sprinkles is back in play? Game on. I ordered a chocolate chip sandwich with peanut butter cup ice cream. What I received was a gargantuan hunk of sweet chocolatey goodness that may have changed my life. It absolutely raised my endorphins. The cookies were massive. Each cookie were much bigger than my hands and I can easily palm a basketball.** They were packed with chocolate chips, thick and had a chewy consistency that matched well with the ice cream. Not too hard. Not too soft. Just right. And the ice cream? Ridiculous. Between both cookies was a slab of creamy, rich, cup-laden peanut butter ice cream that stuck to the cookie and oozed out of the sides with every bite. To house the sandwich, it came in paper that had to be engineered by NASA. This paper never broke or wilted with the wetness of the ice cream. Nor did it leech cold on to my hand. The spoon I had to help each the sandwich came into its own once the cookies were gone and I could scoop out the leftover ice cream IN THE PAPER THAT HAD THE PROPERTIES OF A CUP. I'm telling you: NASA.\n\nThis gluten-free happiness changes everything. Everything. For those of you who can tolerate gluten without issue, you have no excuse. Sprinkles is your jam. Cupcakes, ice cream and cookies... what are you waiting for? \n\n*Can an increase in TV/film production be one of them?\n**DM me.",

All my friends kept thinking I was saying i wanted to go to \"Dunkin\" donuts except all I kept saying was \"Duck\" donuts. Yes, after passing by this place a few times I realized I needed to look it up. When I did I was sold. We went there right before leaving town and despite never having been here before it was a one of a kind experience.\n\nThe young staff that works here gives off such a nice vibe and is truly inviting. The donuts are made fresh at the moment and you have many options to choose from. They're so delicious and fresh!\n\nNot only are they adorable cute, have the cutest logo, but they are soooooo yummy and flavorful. The size isn't way too big but all the flavor is where it's at. The perfect donut texture with enough moisture yet stays firm and doesn't fall apart. We tried different flavors and were not disappointed. \n\nDoggies get free donuts so that's a plus! Come give duck donuts some love!",

Because I enjoyed my first experience and would like to check them out again.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nMy wife and I visited #HPM on the first day that it was open and after much deliberation, Hemingway's was one of the vendors we decided to patronize. While I was eye-balling the El Ultimo, my wife peer pressured me into getting a Cuban sandwich. I've pressured her into ordering what I want to try, many times in the past, so I obliged. Plus, I'm never upset when \"forced\" to eat a Cuban sammy.\n\nBut then I got a little crazy and also ordered chicarones and the guava & cheese empanadas. Not to mention, yuca fries on the side with my Cuban. I don't have a lot of self-control.\n\nUltimately, it was probably a bit too much fried food for one sitting. If I could have gone back, I probably wouldn't have ordered the chicarones. They were a-okay, but probably not worth ordering again. My wife loved the dessert empanadas, while I thought they were pretty solid. \n\nI think we shared the same opinion on the Cuban sandwich that we did on the empanadas. She seemed to really love it, while I thought it pretty tasty. I like when all of the meat in the middle is at least warm, rather than the outside of the bread being toasted, with a colder center. Maybe that violates some kind of traditional Cuban laws, but I just enjoy a consistency in temperature. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it though! And I actually really loved the yuca fries!\n\nWhile I'm still working to make my way around to every HPM vendor, I really want to return to Hemingway's for that steak sandwich!",

The only thing that I wasn't too crazy about were the black beans, they were just missing something. I was hoping that they would be really good but they lacked flavor. They could've used some onions, cilantro, garlic or pepper I don't know some kind of something in them but no biggie I just mixed in a little salsa in with them and it did the trick.

On the day of our wedding, they had a text message chain with some of the wedding party to keep everyone posted.  Well organized and well orchestrated with so little stress involved.\n\nThe buses were fun, amped with music and lights, and clean.

If you are having any sort of event, I recommend getting to know Darin, Sierra, and their lovely chariot.",

Luckily thanks to the Open Table app, we were able to secure a reservation Saturday night for a peak hour seating. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside as it is housed in a large, commercial style building, but the inside is fresh, brightly lit and minimally decorated. \nI award three stars for the experience, as service was friendly, accommodating, timely and food was executed to the best of their ability. Where I found it lacking, was taste and temperature, general atmosphere. Too picky?\nWe ordered the Blue Crab Dip with Parmesan Cream for our first course, second the Cream of Mushroom Soup and Complimentary Salad for the Special Entree, and Entrees were Eggplant Vincent and the Fish of the Day, Redfish, served whole with potatoes and vegetable of the day. \nThe soup was served first, and was under seasoned and not very hot. Crab Dip came next and though gooey, bubbly and tasty, was slightly overshadowed by the pools of oil on top. \nThe entrees were also good, my boyfriend loved the simplicity of his fish and it was cooked correctly. My Eggplant Vincent was  a cup of eggplant breaded and fried and stuffed with crab and shrimp, served over a butter cream sauce and angel hair. Again, slightly under seasoned, but over all a good, tasty dish.\nOverall, not my pick for a romantic evening or food to write home about, but suitable for an affordable, seafood orientated craving.",

  "text": "Fresh off of dinner last night, I wanted to get this review out there, amidst all the positively unshakeable 5 star reviews. \n\nListen, Suraya is GOOOOOOOOD. The food was delicious, we were absolutely full, and the staff is suspiciously nice. The restaurant itself is beautiful, both inside and out, and service was impeccable. So why not 5 stars? \n\nWell, first and foremost, it is EXPENSIVE. This is a common theme you have no doubt, or will no doubt read in other reviews, but I think it bears repeating. This place does not play around with the prices. And although the food IS good, it's also basically a bunch of dips. \n\nOh, which also reminds me; another reason for the not 5 stars, is that you are FORCED to eat the $65 tasting menu on Fridays and Saturdays. You ALSO don't get to pick dessert, which was weird. It was like a big, kind of sweet, but not really sweet, mozzarella stick type dish. And listen, I love fried cheese as much as the next red blooded American, but it's not something I think of when it comes to dessert. It definitely left me a little perplexed, as I couldn't decide if I liked it or hated it, so I just stopped eating it all together. Looked nice though. *shoulder shrug emoji*\n\nBack to the cost thing; a glass of wine is $12. That's what a bottle costs in the stores. A BOTTLE of wine is like $70, which is what a CASE of wine costs in stores. A CUP OF HOT TEA, was FOUR DOLLARS!! That's hot water and a tea bag. That's like a 2000% markup. I can buy TWO BOXES; about 200 tea bags, for $4. Don't misconstrue; the food IS awesome, which is the only reason I didn't flip a table on the way out, but for what was essentially 5 dips, some middle eastern fries (the batata harra, my hands down favorite dish!), 4 little kibbeh (too minty), a piece of roasted lamb, and some chicken thigh pieces, we dropped almost $200. They don't even refill your drink. You want another orange blossom iced tea, that'll be another $4 please.\n\nAnother thing that I didn't like was that the only reservation that was available for us was 4:30, but when we got there at 4:25, we were told that they \"weren't quite ready yet,\" and we had to stand around and wait until about 4:40ish before we were sat. Not a BIG deal, but you'd think if your first reservation was 4:30, you wouldn't wait until 4:29 to get everything started. \n\nI don't want this review to come off negative though. Almost everything was done right, and they hit a lot of high notes too.\n\nAs I mentioned, the staff was perfect. Everyone was super nice, knowledgeable and helpful. They wore all PPE and took things seriously. I even really liked the ordering through QR code thing. I hope that sticks around after Covid!\n\nBottom line, I would absolutely come back to Suraya, or recommend it as a place to try, with the caveat that it's ONLY for \"special occasions.\" Unless you just got it like that, and can afford to drop $250 every time you get a hankering for some baba ganoush.",

  "text": "Love the feel when I first walked in but the crew was slow to react or even acknowledge customers had walked in. Might I add being a first time customer, my impression was not good. I wanted to love this place and have my egg rolls too, I guess I'll be ordering takeout from now on. \n\nSoooo I wanted duck sauce and the bartender stated he never had it hmmm YOU ARE OF ASIAN DESCENT WORKING IN A RESTAURANT IN NEW ORLEANS MAN STOP ACTING STUPID. So I asked if he had anything to substitute it with and he said \"I never had it so I would not know how it taste\". Now I did not ask if he new what it taste like or if he had it. \n\nNow just being in an Asian inspired restaurant he should know off the top of his head an alternative or told me what sauce they had, maybe that's just my opinion? So again I had to ask if there is sauce for the egg rolls and he said yes.\n\nWell got damn we have a winner cha ching. Can I have some of that please, goodness! I didn't even get any utensils, whatever though. The food was awesome but I felt racially profiled in here. \n\nNew Orleans has a massive Asian community and I have always been pleasured with service and food that the culture has to offer. But there was something wrong about this place. Im not sure exactly what it was and the food was awesome. I just felt dirty leaving this place and will not return for personal gain due to negative vibes.\n \nThe food and the place deserve 3 maybe 4 stars depending on your love for this particular style of food, but the service was a complete bump down to a 2 star review. \n\nI do not expect the Vietnamese people to know what Chinese people eat or vice versa so please do not come for me in the comments or direct messages. New Orleans has a major Asian community and a lot of competition. The corner stores, bodegas, and restaurants are flying open left and right.  \n\nIn New Orleans you will find that most maybe 90% of Asian restaurants they all say Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine , that is common in New Orleans. I believe they know what their competitor is serving up, that includes prices, food quality, and sauces IMO.. \n\nPlease do not feel offended by my review it is just my opinion. I have not categorize any resturant as something it does not say on their sign. I have not called a Vietnamese only restaurant a Chinese restaurant. I have not called a Chinese restaurant a Vietnamese restaurant unless the outside of the restaurant sign says both. I also find that the culture pratices are different in each state. It is different in Southern Louisiana than sunny Cali, so please keep that in mind. Again this is not to offend any culture as I am not an expert on either.",

Hands down the best Calzones in Tucson, I love that you have different size options. What I enjoy the most about Fresco's is that their is size for everything on the menu to your liking. So small medium large are all going to fit your needs whether it is with pasta salad or pizza! Over all the quality of the food here never disappoints and is always fresh, I enjoy the service that is always given. The employee's inside the establishment are always positive and provide you with excellent service! A insider is to get on their little rewards program, you will get emailed with coupons and great deals! :)",

So four stars it is.\n\nThe maple bacon is one of my dog's favorite things ever... She knows it by appearance and will bark trying to get me to give it to her she adores it so much. Personally, I prefer Vincent Van Doughnut's version... But Strange's is cheaper and since my dog loves it, I go with it. You can't deprive a dog named Moscato, right? So on special doggie days (her birthday, the day I brought her home, the day we reunited after she got lost, etc) she gets one.\n\nI personally only get excited about the Campfire donut. And even then I think it's more nostalgia related than taste related. I certainly don't bark/gruff or dance on my hind legs at the sight of it. We can't all have the joys in our lives that dogs do though... But seeing it in their eyes is nearly as good",

  "text": "I LOVE Thai food. I mean LOVE LOVE. But this place is such a huge let down. I've come here about 3 times now hoping the food was just off the time I got their food. But no. Their food is either too sweet, too salty or too rich. Thai food should not be overly heavy; the herbs and ingredients should all sing together but it doesn't here. I think they have Americanized their food so much that it has lost its authentic touch. This last time I got their Pad See Ew... the sauce, was more like super heavy gravy. The noodles were mush and just sad. I want to cry because I usually say you can never go wrong with Thai food. The food is pricey here. I guess this place is still around only because of the busy location. I would suggest driving a little further and trying out Thip's Thai Cuisine.",

  "text": "After receiving some information about this restaurant from my other go-to, Thrillist, my boyfriend and a friend of ours decided to go here.  \n\nWe called about 2 hours before going, and were told that we did not need a reservation.  However, when we arrived, we were asked to wait so that the hostess could call a large party to see if they could come later (because of us).  I guess they were fine with it, because we ate!  Buuut if I were that other party I would have been a little confused.\n\nAnyway, besides that small mix-up, I loved our meal and the staff.  We ordered a bunch of different appetizers, soup, rolls, and sashimi to share.  My favorite things were the seaweed salad, and the spicy salmon roll.  I'm sure the spicy tuna roll is great as well, considering it's the same ingredients except the change of fish.  The yellow tail sashimi was delicious, and I usually don't even like sashimi.  \n\nHighly recommend this new joint!  Remember to BYOB.",

I was a huge fan of jen Carroll but had been disappointed in her post Too chef days.... until now. \nIt always makes me feel a bit odd to go to a restaurant in the lobby of a hotel, but this isn't that. So first off the space is amazing. I may be in the minority here but I love how roomy everything is. There is an amazing amount of space between tables and so servers aren't trying to squeeze by, and I don't feel like I have to listen to anyone else's conversation. Win. \nLet's get to the food--it's Mediterranean inspired and done oh so well. I would go back for the baked cheese alone. Can this be my happy hour? A drink and baked cheese? I do wish it came with some bread as opposed to being 2$ extra. \nThe octopus was cooked perfectly and while I loved everything else on the dish (squash, sauce, mushrooms)--I just wanted more octopus! \nThe cauliflower was executed so well. \nBut... my favorite part of my meal was the lamb shank. I am normally not a person who chooses lamb on the menu.... but this I would do a billion times over. It's perfectly cooked and fall off the bone. It gives zahav's a run for its money!\n\nI'm super excited to have this restaurant to impress guests!",

I showed up about 15 minutes later than scheduled to give time to have it ready. \n Here is were the cheesesteak place I have been patronizing for over a decade and I always promote them when people ask where to get a good sandwich from, showed me exactly how much they care about their customers. \n\nI walk in I'm not greeted. The lady at the register acted as if she didn't see me.. meanwhile her co worker continues to write on a note pad. When the lady at the register finally acknowledged me I say \"good morning\" and I tell her I have a pick up order. \nI give her the name she goes we didn't take your name. I explained the app takes the name. So after several exchanges of you don't have an order I show them the receipt. \n\nShe still denies it but, the young lady working with her asked to look at my receipt. I show her. They will now begin to make my order, however they have to manually take the order. I give the younger lady my phone she wrote down the order. I do notify them I had a flight to catch and I put the order in early so I could head straight to the airport after I leave(as I always do).\nI asked for it to be packed to travel.. they used to be really good at doing this. Trust I know, I take cheesesteaks home to Tennessee every-time I come to Philly.  This time They didn't bother. They barely wrapped them. The one piece of aluminum foil they wrapped around my sandwich unraveled. So now the cheesesteaks are all inside the bag they threw it. \nWow Larry's this is what we are doing now...... \nI won't be returning. I don't care how much my father loves this place... \nNever an apology for the mishap. But, what could I expect when the lady at the register isn't even friendly.",

  "text": "Regrub is one of those places you really, really want to love. It's new, it's been trendy somewhere else (Calgary), it's colorful, its menu is full of funny names, and it's convenient to the Whyte Ave walking stretch of pavement.\n\nI was excited to \"drop a pin\" into this nouveau burger experience, doubly so with a bit of the hangry. So the other half did the ordering while I soaked in the ambiançe: it's like the Teletubbies grew up to high school, got to plan a menu, decorate a space, pick a soundtrack and make social media accounts. Yeah, it's like that.\n\nThat part is all good. It's a fun, colorful space with happy, shiny staff. The fail parts are the execution of the food and the value-for-money propositions. Those could use a lot of tweaking.\n\nShe wanted the Lutter, a 4 oz Alberta Beef patty with bacon, egg, and cheddar surrounded by a bun of split glazed donuts. I liked the contrast of the sweet and savoury, whereas the 'bunny felt the donut didn't meet up to her Tim Horton'y expectations. (It tasted to me like a Krispy Kreme regular glazed donut, FYI.)\n\nThe Cheesy Jr., a 4 oz patty topped with mac n' cheese with bacon bits, arrived looking (seriously) like those Halloween caricatures of a pumpkin vomiting out its insides. Yes, there's pale creamy pasta with bits covering most of the serving tray... in a competition, this contestant would have been sent home. It's a presentation that screams \"I'm so drunk I can't even bother looking for flatware. I'm using my hands and lots of paper towels.\" Still, it's the taste that counts (mostly) but this explosion wasn't rescued: it was under-salted and nowhere as cheesy as it *needed* to be.\n\nMy ultimate measure of a restaurant's worth to me comes down to whether it (1) delivers a food that I can't easily make at home along with (2) an experience that's memorable at (3) a rationalizable price. Regrub fails on the former; I can whip up dorm-quality meat patties & KD without any effort. The middle; okay, interesting location slash vibe slash space. The latter; meh. Everyone felt mugged.\n\nThe worst thing of all? This is *so* close to executing well. Krikey, taste the damn food on the way out of the kitchen! Tighten up food design and assembly; try to be impressing someone...\n\nOh, and your Instagram counter behind the till is broken. Even that narcissistic rush doesn't work. Meh.",

  "text": "Butcher & Bee is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Nashville. If you're a foodie and/or a hipster, forgo the meat and three and BBQ and meander over to East Nashville for a dining experience. Here's why I loved Butcher & Bee:\n\n1) The food- It's a small plate concept with the majority of dishes being vegetable based (though they do have some meat options). My friend and I ordered four small plates and a dessert to share and we left content. A few stand outs: The whipped feta is their signature. It is good, but if you don't like feta to begin with, order something else. Avocado crispy rice- It's more salad with a whole avocado mixed in and crunch North Carolina rice. Butternut squash soup- Bold flavors with a pomegranate seed garnish. Meat balls- comes in a triad and has cheese and bread crumbs mixed in. The chocolate pot de creme with chili was good, but not sweet (In case you're obsessed with sugar like me).\n\n2) The atmosphere- It's slick and the simple art around the restaurant is perfectly placed. We sat at the small table in front of their logo painted on the wall and several Instagrammers stopped by to snap a photo. Warning: The light is low so it doesn't make for the best photos.\n\n3) The location- It's just off of Main Street in East Nashville within walking distance to other Nashville finds like Edley's BBQ and Family Wash. \n\n4) The service- It's the South so it was friendly, but not in a fake or annoying way.\n\nIf you want a good Nashville dining experience that's on the cutting edge of Nashville's food scene pivot, go to Butcher and Bee. Just don't Google it because you'll find it's NOT a local joint (It's from Charleston, South Carolina).",

  "text": "I went here for the first time yesterday with my mother and I will say that it was amazing. The place from the outside doesn't look appealing, however, the inside is much better. It is not a fancy steakhouse but it is dark and clean and reminded me of a old time steakhouse which I loved. \n\nMy mom and I both got the prime rib lunch special and it was AMAZING. It is an 8oz prime rib(which seemed much larger to me, more like 10 or 12oz). It also comes with a few mushrooms and a side. I got the prime rib medium and grilled which makes the fat much more charred and delicious. It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing. It laid in a bed of Au jus and it was plenty, didn't need to ask for more which I usually do. There wasn't a whole lot of fat on the prime rib so it was trimmed nicely but still had plenty to eat multiple small bites with the meat which I love. They have the lunch specials Monday-Saturday until 3pm and this was the most expensive thing on the menu and cost $10.95 which is an awesome price. \n\nI got a baked potato which was $1.25 up charge and it was the best baked potato I've ever had. Very soft and cooked perfectly and a great size. I will probably upgrade for the baked potato every time. \n\nMy mom and I also shared a bowl of French onion soup and it was wonderful. They put a bunch of cheese on it and boil it to such a perfection that when you bite into it there is a wonderful crunch. The flavor was amazing too. It was $6.50 for a small bowl which is expensive to me but so worth it!!\n\nI asked for a drink menu when I first got there and the waitress told me they do not have a drink menu but told me they had a 2 for 1 wine special going on so me and my mom ordered two white zinfandels and they were a great size, more like 9oz instead of your usual 6oz. It was kind of expensive to me for a glass of wine at $9.95 but the sizes were great so it was worth it. \n\nI cannot wait to go back and will probably get the prime rib every time!",

They promptly respond to maintenance requests (fixed my sink within 12 hours, fixed the breaker on the electricity in 2 hours, fixed miniblinds/windows in 3 days).  Neighbors are nice and keep to themselves.  The only thing is that in our building, packages don't get delivered (whether it's USPS, UPS) you have to pick them up which can be a pain. The bathroom is small, and the kitchen sink doesn't have a garbage disposal. All else is well-kept up, clean, and comfortable. I love it here: close to downtown, quiet, city-like.

  "text": "What a killer place! We came here with a giftcard not sure what to expect and were just blown away. We had an excellent waiter who explained the craft cocktail set up (his exact words were \"Don't expect to look at the bar and see any liquor you could find at a grocery store.\"). He provided consistently excellent service without being intrusive. The inside is decorated really nicely and creates a great vibe. It's 21+ at the door.\n\nI asked for some advice on which drink to get, and after the waiter asked about my liquor preferences, I landed on a drink called \"Let's Have a Tiki\" or something like that. It wasn't your typical frou-frou rum drink, but it was pretty tasty (and strong). My husband's first drink was the Indiana English, which he got because it was made with Pimm's (and the only other similar drink we've ever had is the traditional Pimm's Cup). It also had whiskey, which he enjoyed. His second drink was the Eldermonk, which he liked but I loved. When (not if) we go back, that's the drink I'll get. I'm not sure how to describe it (minty? a little fruity? aromatic?), but it was one of the waiter's recommendations and it didn't disappoint. Our only food sampling was the onion rings, and they were fantastic. When they arrived at our table I was intrigued, since they had bordelaise sauce and a fried egg on top, but they were awesome. The order was a good size for two people, although I wouldn't say no to more!\n\nWhen we got home my husband said, \"So how often are we allowed to go back?\" It's obviously pricey (about $10 per drink), but we felt that it was well worth it. We're looking forward to going back and taking friends and family. This is a great place to show off Indy!",

The seafood was all delicious (the crab cake was my favorite) and what made it even better was it was only $30! The salmon was very juicy and tender, the shrimp and scallops were great, and the lobster was meaty. The two of us also got the sashimi tacos, which were sooo good. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the dishes here, especially with such fresh seafood. We also bought a pound of shrimp to go to cook at home and they were very plump and flavorful.\n\nThe market itself is pretty cool with informative diagrams about how to order seafood and has all supplies/ingredients needed to make your own meal. The option to buy any fresh seafood in the store and have then cook if for an additional $4 is cool! We will definitely be back to try that and other items on the menu.\n\nThe location is close to the Broad Street Line as well as other restaurants and bars on Passyunk. Seating area is very casual and staff are all very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to try more seafood here!",

  "text": "Ordered this as takeout and I agree with what most reviewers have said so far, that Bareburger is a new kid in town and needs some time to work out the kinks. \n\nThe good: An extensive burger menu with a lot of options for vegans, vegetarians, and meat lovers alike. I cannot remember the last time I saw goat on the menu at a non-Indian restaurant. There are also a lot of interesting options for cheeses and toppings, and the sauces also all sounded appealing. I enjoyed the brioche bun that I chose for my build-your-own turkey burger, the aged cheddar paired nicely with it, and I liked the leafy greens and wild mushrooms. \n\nNeeds work: The one element that was lacking in flavor for me was the patty itself. The outside had a nice char on it, but the patty was overcooked making it kind of dry. The meat mixture also tasted like it had no seasonings whatsoever mixed in. Not sure if that's a deliberate decision, or something to consider working on. But with a patty sans flavor, sauce is a must. \n\nAlso got an order of fries and rings, while the fries were mushy I can't really criticize them for this as I did get them as takeout, and also, I kind of like mushy fries. \n\nWould be willing to try this place again a few months from now.",

And some seafood from some places contain heavy metal. So naturally i'm worried so i asked that Asian lady who works there about this, and she told me everything I wanted to know, and she knows what cut you need for different dishes. \n\nCoffee bar:\nOh don't forget to grab an iced Chai latte on your way out at the coffee bar, omg it tastes so good although it is from a bottle......\n\nHot/Cold/and Salad bar:\nThe only thing I am not so happy about is that round 9:30PM they will take foods trays off the hot food bar, why!!!!! You still got 30 mins away from closing!  And also, I buy lunch and dinner almost everyday there, and you guys rarely change things around don't you? I'm getting sick and tired of most food you guys have in the hot food bar.  \nAnd who thought it is a good idea to put a spoon for us to get noodles from the hot bar???? Give us clamps for the love of god! \nAnd the dressing bottles in the salad bar, i strongly recommend you guys change the bottles, because i feel awkward doing jerking motion for a good half minute during rush hour just to get some dressing in my salad, plus do you realize how hard it is to shake some of the dressing out of the bottle? Dressings like caesar is too sticky for us to get it out of the bottle.  Some the olive oil bottle is often too slippery to hold on to due to there is oil all over outside of the bottle. \nAlso, if you guys can cut the kale a bit smaller into mouth-size that'll be nice, so i don't have to open my mouth to its limit just to put it in my mouth.  Another thing is that ice chips in the kale salad is not pleasant.",

Cookies, brownies, and granola bites are all amazing ways to end your meal. A bit on the pricier side but portions are generous and ingredients are fresh and real!",

The ambiance was nice and quiet with someone playing the piano and we both loved the kind of intimate feel this place gives off. The waitress gave us a complimentary pumpkin bisque soup which was AMAZING. So good, that I didn't even realize there was crab in it and I don't like seafood. It was definitely a little pricey but anywhere that makes good \"Sex On The Beach\" cocktails makes me want to go back. I strongly recommend giving this place a try!",

I was pleasantly surprised, though intimate and quaint, the rustic charm of brick walls, high ceilings, and windows all around with views of the city, made it anything but an ordinary boxed up venue. I have honestly never been to anything like it and was impressed.\n\nThough I did not order a drink, the bar menu made it easy for ordering with every spirit and beer they offer listed on a chalkboard menu.\n\nMy favorite feature was the elevated sitting area to the side with bar stools and tables. \n\nWould love to see my favorite bands play here, as I prefer small venues.",

  "text": "TL: DR - inside the exit corridor of home Depot. No frills, but surprisingly amazing food for a food stand. Few warm seating options in the winter, outside picnic table in the summer.\n\nI can't believe I'm writing a review for a hot dog stand, but this place really is amazing. You have to be some kind of special to make a living on a hot dog stand. But this really is my go to place for a hot dog, I've been to Steve's hot dogs in Tower Grove and found their hot dogs almost too big and ended up having to eat them with a fork and knife like a casserole dish. First off, this place is inside the exit corridor of home depot. Dirty dogs has great combinations, ample toppings, and still allows me to eat my hot dog like a civilized human being eating a hot dog outside a Home Depot.\n\nThey have like 20 sauces (i.e., mustards, ketchups, and hot sauces) you can top your hot dog with, I really ever go for like the same 4, and sometimes you don't want any of the sauces cuz it'll mess with your existing toppings. Plus the sauces look a bit old. But what really makes this place is their super soft buns, o geez... Anyways, I've had the chilli dog (amazing), the jalapeno and cream cheese dog (surprisingly amazing), and the St Louis (provel and pizza sauce) dog (not surprisingly bad). The gf always gets the Chicago dog and loves it, craves it dare I say.\n\nFew other things to note, if it's winter time (which today was), there's not always a warm place to eat. Sometimes they have a bench inside (today they did not). If it's warm enough though, they usually have a picnic table outside. \n\nDecor, it's home depot-y. Price, not bad, bout $3.50 for a regular grocery store Frank with all the fixins, and about $5 for a larger dog with all the fixins.",

I was also happy to find out that there is a summer event, too! Glad I can purchase local goods all in one location twice a year. \n\nThe building is a little confusing, and there are a lot of vendors (just under 60 according the website!), so I recommend giving yourself plenty of time to peruse. I parked on a side street both times, and wasn't too far from the venue, but I could see one might end up somewhat far if they came during peak time.\n\nI arrived early enough this time to pick up a goodie bag, which included a couple of items from vendors (wearing the nail polish I received right now - thanks Different Dimensions!) as well as some coupons (didn't see these until I got home - check your bag before you shop!). I checked out the vendor list before I came to expedite things, since it can be a bit crowded. Worked out great - I had purchased a ring last year from Sloane Jewelry and lost it, so wanted to get another because I loved it. I didn't see my ring at her booth, but I asked just in case, and sure enough she had the ring I was looking for behind the booth! So if you don't see quite what you're looking for, check with the vendor. \n\nThere are lots of great things to see and buy - make sure you make it to both the gym and the basement! Various artist's studios, as well.",

Stacks of produce that look picture perfect.. fresh whole fish on ice that remind me of the markets I love in coastal areas.. all sorts of beautiful meats of every description.. and a better cheese selection than I've seen at anywhere in Tennessee, period. In short, the fresh foods here look like food that would be used in photo ads or commercial shoots. Yes it's pricey, but that's just a function of carrying beautiful, fresh, organic, and often local food. \n\nWhat's REALLY awesome about this place is the little cafe back by the seafood section. A ton of people eat at Whole Foods by buying stuff at the hot bars and salad bar, and while those are quite tasty, the cafe in the back serves what could possibly be the best darn burger in Nashville. Local beef, local buns, even local goat cheese and local fried eggs as toppings if you wish. They don't have to bother with gimmicky burgers topped with crazy ingredients; just fresh, simple, local, and superb. If you enjoy a good burger, you owe it to yourself to try the ones here.",

The owner was tending bar and was great with info about the place and their beers. It was not crowded at all but I can't imagine it staying that way once people know about how good the beer is. Very relaxed atmosphere with interesting artwork, chairs, and light fixtures.\n\nWhile you probably didn't care about that stuff...the beer...I didn't have a bad one. Usually you'll find one you love, some that are average, and many you don't like. I wouldn't say I disliked any of them. They have a wide selection and several IPAs for the hop heads like me. German Chocolate Cupcake Stout was solid, as were their IPAs and Red Ale.\n\nYou might think parking is tricky but there is a large paved lot next to it and a dirt lot across the street. They always say don't park on Fern. They don't serve food but you can bring it with you or have it delivered there. Make sure you visit this brewery.",

So, I set my appointment up online (which I love...I won't even consider a place if it does not have online booking) and scheduled a single color process and cut with Ryan. What a great experience! I brought along a couple of pics with me, told Ryan I wanted to go shorter and darker to celebrate fall, and he delivered with a super cute cut and a pretty darker, warmer color which was exactly what I asked for. I told him that I'm in a medical program and spend even less time doing my hair than I used to (which was always not long) so he gave me a cut that will look nice with my natural waves without requiring much effort. He even shared some styling tips with me. It was actually the shortest in duration hair experience I have ever had but I don't think that should be used as a marker for quality...it probably is just because he knew what he was doing. I was actually relieved that it did not take more than 2 hours! Also, I found the price quite reasonable (unlike others who have posted on here), but maybe that is because I just moved from an inner city area where prices are inflated. \n\nGreat experience here and will definitely be back.",

We checked out the bar and luckily were able to grab two seats next to each other as a couple was leaving. Not 10 minutes later, my phone buzzed letting us know that our table was ready....what? That was a quick hour. I'm not sure if they were just trying to turn people away because it was getting crowded, but we decided to stick it out at the bar.\n\nHaving had the burgers before, I thought I would try something different and got the BBQ grilled chicken wrap with a side of mac 'n cheese. My wife had the ultimate grilled cheese with tator tots. The food was good, nothing astounding. I think I will stick with the burgers next time though. The food came out quickly enough and the bartenders were very pleasant and attentive, even with an almost full bar. The price wasn't that bad for a downtown Indy restaurant/bar of this type. We each had one drink with our meals and ended up paying about $28 bucks. \n\nThere was an NCAA game on at the time, so it was pretty loud with people cheering for their respective team. It was difficult to talk to my wife at times even though we were sitting right next to each other.\n\nThe outdoor area looked really cool with the fire pit and lounges all around. I am definitely interested in going back later in the year when it is warmer and checking it out. It was a little too cold to be outside when we were there (that didn't stop some people from playing corn hole though). If you are looking for a good place to hang out downtown and love hamburgers, I would check Scotty's out. I would definitely go back.",

Great location for what we wanted, clean, courteous staff, comfy bed.\n\nIf you're looking for a hotel within walking distance of about 15 bars and even more restaurants then this is where you want to be.  The idea of the trip was to experience the real Nashville and not all the tourist traps.  What better way to experience Nashville and the people than drink?  Just take a left out of the parking lot, walk a couple blocks past the piano man, hang a right and you're where you want to be to drink & eat.  And it's an easy stumble back or cheap cab ride after several cocktails.\n\nThe one thing when I stay in a hotel that I rarely like are the showers. Some shower heads are clogged up with very little water pressure, the curtains are funky, and the towels are too small.  Not here at the Best Western!! The shower head was nice and big with plenty of water pressure and it was easy to get the perfect temperature.  The towels were hotel size but for some reason I was ok with them. Usually it takes me 2 to get dry, maybe I'm getting older and know how to use a towel now ;)\n\nWhat's the first thing you do when you get in the room?.......Jump on the bed of course.  It was rock hard to jump on but then I started to sink in...MEMORY FOAM!!! I loved it, it was an amazing 3 night of sleep, but I'm sure the alcohol helped.  I didn't want to get out of bed in the mornings, it was just that comfortable.\n\nReally the only down side was that the fitness center was a bit sparse, but if you're just looking to get some cardio in then they have 4 very nice machines.  If you lift weights like me it will be a bit of a challenge.\n\nNext time I'm in Nashville I know where I'm staying!!",

I had vowed not to purchase jewelry here again, I had been spoiled by Oaxaca jewelry, yet this place has changed my mind I eagerly anticipate buying from them come Little Bit's Birthday and Mother's Day.\n\nRespectfully Reviewed",

  "text": "I hesitate to downgrade my review for this place because it's a decent bar with a lot of good beers and decent food but the service my last visit is a good reason to do so. The chipotle hummus was good, a nice spiced spread with pita chips, carrots and celery. I really enjoyed my blue gouda stout burger with the horseradish a cool, creamy spread with a bit of kick and I love the sauteed mushrooms and onions in it. \n\nOur server though was really slow and I swear there were times that she just out right ignored us. We waited on her to give us menus and then she walked away and it took time for her to come back for drink orders and she was about to walk away before she took our food order-she gave me enough time to figure out what I wanted. She went around the area twice before she even came back with our beers and the food did come out all at once but waited and waited for our check to come and get my cc and then return with my check-enough that I was concerned for a little bit that my identity was being stolen.\n\nMight check out the other bars in Nashville before coming back.",

The place was packed because they were having a benefit, wow to the entertainment.  My hubby and I didn't eat but our friends had nachos and devoured them lol so I'm going to say they were really good lol.  I definitely want to go back - only complaint I can even suggest is that mother nature released the love bugs which drove us nuts - we ordered beer by the buckets and they have to uncap them, which is fine except you have to use napkins to keep out the love lol.  Great job will definitely go again!",

  "text": "5 STARS x 2! 10 STARS! And a HUGE KUDOS to Chef Lisa & her very friendly Army veteran brother Brian, the co-owners of this exceptional casual eatery that opened its doors in June 2020 in the midst of Covid restrictions. TRULY AMAZING fresh flavors & textures! \n\nEverything you'll eat here is prepared on site, & the blue crabs are flown in weekly. Prices are somewhat higher than you may find elsewhere, but I can pretty much guarantee you will NOT get the same level of flavor and quality elsewhere as you will here. \n\nI am almost beyond words; this restaurant SERIOUSLY SCREAMS QUALITY! The menu is jam-packed w/ so many delectable offerings-- seafood appetizers, entrees, soups, salads, sandwiches, along w/ wings & sides. There's even dessert on the menu (such as Banana Pudding & Pound Cake, providing you'll still have room in your belly).\n\nAfter much time staring at the downloaded menu (& practically drooling over the many choices), we ordered the North Ave Crab Balls (4) @ $16. They were by far the BEST CRAB BALLS (or cakes) we've ever tasted! Unlike others, upon every bite we saw & tasted fresh crab-- very little breading. SEE THE PICS! Seriously, GREAT CRAB BALLS! Our Prince George Shrimp Tacos @ $15 were Very Good-- light & flavorful (see pic). Yummy. \n\nAccording to very friendly Niki, the following menu items are extremely POPULAR: North Ave Crab Balls (Yes, ma'am!); Crab Cakes; Blue Crab Seafood Pizza; Blue Crab Nachos; Catfish Sandwich; & the Salmon Philly Cheese sandwich. \n\nThe soups sounded amazing, & we were privileged to taste samples of the daily Maryland Crab Soup & the Rockville Shrimp & Corn Chowder (available only on Saturdays). Both were EXCELLENT, although we both preferred the creamy & rich texture of the chowder. We shall have to return to order the Crab & Corn (Fridays only) & the Cream of Crab (available only on Sundays). Niki also brought us a basket of warm, fresh Blue Crab Chips to try. A simple, yet wonderful, $4 appetizer -- SEE PIC! \n\nNot into seafood? There are wings on the menu in quantities of five ($7), ten ($12); fifteen ($18) & twenty ($22). \n\nAdditional items that piqued my interest & not previously mentioned: Fish Tacos; Grilled Salmon; Crab Cake Sandwich; Soft Shelled Crab Sandwich; Blue Crab Shack Salad; Fried Shrimp & Fried Fish dinners; Shrimp Quesidias; Shrimp Po Boy (regular or spicy); Shrimp & Grits (Sunday only); & Fish & Grits (also Sunday only). I'm quite sure I omitted others that sounded & looked INCREDIBLE. (Download the menu to enjoy the vivid menu pics!) You, too, may experience great difficulty deciding what to order.\n\nInterested in taking Blue Crabs home? WEEKLY, Brian & Lisa have 200 to 400 lbs flown in from the Chesapeake area. Customers must pre-order & pay for their Crab on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday to receive them Thursday thru Sunday.\n\nHave you checked out this business's webpage? It's bright, organized, & easily navigated. Patrons may order online for easy pick-up. Catering is available. This seafood restaurant participates in fundraising; Brian & Lisa select one organization monthly to receive 15% of all net sales; use the online form to have your organization considered. \n\nDue to the small, sparse, very casual dining room (see pics), this restaurant may not be where some would want to take a love interest on a first date; however, if s/he were wanting to impress a guest by feeding him or her SUPERIOR seafood cuisine, this is the place to come-- hands down MY FAVORITE SEAFOOD EATERY IN MY FIVE YEARS ON YELP! \n\nChef Niki may not be professionally trained, but this woman can run circles around the Best of the Best! \n\nI have driven up to Nashville 3x over the past nine months. I shall drive up again-- & EACH AND EVERY TIME I will stop in to try more of Lisa's remarkable creations. Born & bred in Maryland, but here via Atlanta, she is Madison, Tennessee's (& our) win!",

The only thing I would recommend next time is asking for it to be less salty, if that is possible! Besides that I was pleased with everything. I also LOVED their red velvet cookies that Andrew makes. \n\nOur friends got a side of the kimchi, chips and salsa, beans and rice and added the famous \"table sauce\" to their entree and they couldn't stop raving about it. The owner also gave my friend a side of the spicy carrots on his way out, very sweet of him!\n\nAlso, I like that you can draw on the tables with chalk, haha, sometimes it's nice to be a kid again! \n\nThe highlight of the evening was the owner Andrew, such a cool guy! One of the main reasons we will be coming back. It's always nice to see when someone goes out of their way for their customers, you can tell he is a genuine dude and that he really cares about his customers and has passion for his company. \n\nNext time you walk past this place on Twiggs, stop in, check them out, and give Andrew a shout!",

I wandered down the street and was drawn in by the sandwich-board sign that they had on the street. \n\nThere were only a few other people in there eating breakfast. I had the huevos and a few ($2.50, by the way...) mimosas and a cup of coffee. My food was delicious, the fluffiest eggs ever! The mimosa was alright, nothing of course to rave about, and the coffee was crappy. Eh, I wasn't expecting spectacular. I was a little disappointed by the service- two servers working 4 tables, and they spent allll of their time looking up TV's on and IPhone with an obvious regular. We all love regulars, but give everyone else a little attention!\n\nOh well, regardless. Good food, decent experience. May give try it again next time I find myself in the ball park.",

  "text": "Ughhhh... I'm going to sound like President Obama when he talks about the economy here for just a moment: \n\nLook, the fact that City Dogs exists and is in place for future considerations is something we're pleased to see, but there are many avenues that need to be discussed before any further elated ventures. \n\nIt's true. I'm on the fence here -- big time. I love this place. I love that it exists. I love that they opened a location basically in our neighborhood -- East End of Mass Ave -- and they serve as downtown's only choice for organic, healthy full-supply pet food. I love the owners. I love the food they have. I love the toys, the treats, the conversations, the knowledge, the location, the service, the food options, the openness to give out samples to see what our dog likes. So what is it?\n\nThe Hours. \n\nI had no idea this is what 'the hours' meant when Virgina Woolf writes to Leonard -- her husband -- \"To look life in the face. Always to look life in the face. And to know it for what it is. At last to know it is. To love it for what it is. And then to put it away. Leonard always the years between us, always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.\" \n\nYeah, I'm the yelper that quotes Virginia Woolf. \n\nHopefully I'll also quote Virginia Woof who says, \"please extend the hours of City Dogs as closing so early and opening so late leaves dog owners high and dry when in need -- especially in a pinch. Maybe just one day a week where they can rely upon the longer hours to accomplish all tasks. I mean, hey, maybe it'll create a Friday frenzy of pet owners who come to your store to hang out, purchase and party. First Fridays, even?\"",

Trust him.  He'll take care of you and pamper your whole group like your family (family he likes, that is!).  He even gave a tiny sample of dolce de leche sauce to go because I felt in love with it.  I took it back to my hotel and rubbed it on my naked body -- it was THAT good.  \n\nTry sitting up on the patio outside upstairs.  Nice weather and an arts-district soho noho vibe.  \n\nBeautiful decor.\n\nExtensive menu but I'll highlight several things...\n\nYou must try the cauliflower starter.  Oh my!  A total hit with the table.  And the cheese empanadas were divine!  \n\nFor entrees --\nMy colleagues and I also loved the Mahi mahi tacos and skirt steak but by far the winner for dinner entrees was the Portobello Tostada.  I am noooooo where near a vegetarian, but this thing was BURSTing with flavor and a hit with everyone.\n\nFor dessert--\nGet the same platter.\nBeautiful chocolate flan.\nYummy tres leches cake.\nAnd for 4 women from So Cal --- unanimous vote for best churros ever!  It was a surprise to all of us.  The dulce de leche sauce was lick-the-plate fantastic!  \n\nAlso try their version of The Cadillac Margarita - boozie and yummy!\n\nSo surprised to have such a great dining experience in the middle of Indy, but we loved it and highly recommend it to locals and travelers alike!\n\nNon appetite!",

It seemed like a mix of tourists and locals.\n\nSince we never got the hang of ordering properly -- us Californians are used to smaller portions -- we asked for an ungodly amount of food. An enormous basket of fried okra, fried chicken, mustard greens, collared greens, mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Though the fried okra was pretty good (also seems hard to mess this up), and the sides were fantastic, the fried chicken stood out for me. That batter is insane. We didn't talk the whole way through the meal: a sign of a good one!

  "text": "For the seven year anniversary of when we met, we decided to try somewhere we hadn't yet. \nWhen I need to find a new place to try I look on Yelp. The pictures, menu and reviews for M3 reeled me in...but the reason we chose M3 was for their Stroganoff. My husband LOVES stroganoff and I hardly make it at home. You should've seen the look of excitement he got when I mentioned it! And that was that. \nThe entrance is clearly stated in previous reviews and someone we still managed to get a little lost looking! Inside is warm woods and deep booths. The dining room was separate from the bar which makes it a bit more private. The two TVs add a pub feel. \nFirst I ordered a Moscow mule, and while it wasn't bad it wasn't special like some I've had...the menu is simple yet inspired. The Grilled Artichokes and the Brie cheese skillet caught our eyes. The artichoke was tender and flavorful grilled and the curry mango Brie bruschetta skillet was decadent and delicious!! My husbands not a big fan of Brie so I got ...all... of it HA! \nNext I ordered the creamy mushroom soup. The soup was earthy, and super creamy with huge slices of fresh mushrooms. Everything you would want in a creamy mushroom soup, it was the best! Finally my hubby got his stroganoff and I got the lamb. He says the meat in the stroganoff was very tender and the whole dish was perfect. \nThe lamb was perfectly cooked with a sweet yet tangy fig balsamic reduction. Out of this world. And the Marscapone polenta was very creamy (The consistency of mashed potatoes) and very very good. Finally the veggies were fresh, crisp and garlicky. A perfect addiction. \nBy the end I was stuffed to perfection! The waiter was on top of things, perfectly timing our entrees to come out right after our appetizer. He was great, and so was his bus boy, who was definitely on top of dirty dishes. \nFive stars. We will definitely be coming back!",

Evidently, Thursday and Sunday are fried chicken days! And I had that lovely specimen for dinner!!! Sadly, though, it was underseasoned . . . so, while crunchy and juicy, it was rather bland.\n\nBeyond that, I had a wonderful to-go vessel of half of my broccoli and more than half of my steak for another day!

  "text": "Located in O'fallon. It is a cute location with ample space inside. We ordered the special which was Lg pizza, large salad, and breadsticks for $24.95. Thought it was a great deal for the amount of food. We had a large group so we also tried half alfredo/buffalo chicken pizza (bonus points for allowing half and half). We aren't used to the sweet sauce, so if you don't like it, I would prefer asking for original sauce. I did not care for the sauce, but a couple of my friends loved it. I did however really like the specialty pizza. So I would go out on a limb and try something different, if you enjoy the tradition style flavor pizza. Service was good. They got really busy but were still attentive.",

I was led to this restaurant because my bf had worked out our travel itinerary for Santa Barbara and a yelper had described this place as having the best burger in SB.  Really now?\n\nMy bf got the Teriyaki Charburger.  He said it was good and it surely did look good.  But he said the teriyaki sauce was a bit overpowering and he wasn't able to taste the burger itself.\n\nI got the Veggie Burger sandwich, as I am a vegetarian.  I got it on grilled sourdough with cheese.  It was average.  The patty was just a regular Gardenburger patty they probably took out of the freezer.  \n\nWhat I did love was the onion rings.  Amazing onion rings!  Seriously, what kind of batter did they use?  My bf felt like it tastes like the same batter used for crunchy fried shrimp.  The onions were cooked perfectly so that when you bite into the ring, you actually bite off the onion cleanly without dragging any of it out of the breading.  Perfectly crunchy with flavor... mmMMmm!\n\nThis location made it look like a hole-in-the-wall place, with it's outdoor seatin and order-at-the-window and pick-up-at-the-window style service.  Convenient parking lot in back.",

  "text": "My husband and I visited Steak 33 and had a remarkable time. My husband really likes steaks, so I thought this would be the perfect place for our date night. First things first,we selected and enjoyed the sparkling wine. For appetizers, we chose the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and Baked Oysters. Both were delicious, but I really enjoyed the crab cake. Remember, MAMA LOUISIANA!!! My husband got the Filet Steak. He was highly impressed with the quality. He says it was one of the best steaks in the city. I chose the poultry, which was the Daily Fish. I have photos below of the (seasoned to perfection) fish. I love, love, love the sauce on the fish. For sides, we got potatoes au grautins and creamed spinach. Even though I am a foodie, I still like to incorporate veggies when I can. The Au Gratin menu at Steak 33 is pretty extensive. You can get anything Au Gratin from Spinach, Cauliflower, Potatoes, Peas, Crabmeat, Lobster and Broccoli. We topped off our date night with a Rum Rasin bread pudding. That was just the 'creme De La creme'.  Magnificent!! \n​\nThe restaurant is located on Bourbon Street. Perfect for getting out there then grabbing a good dinner to soak up all of the drinks! The waiters were extremely helpful and accommodating to us. We will be back for the Fried Chicken Brunch in September.",

They don't take reservations, but I got there around 10:30 AM on a Monday and only had to wait for a half hour (party of 2). Plus, you don't have to wait outside like you do at Biscuit Love! \n\nI started with the Lavender Honey Latte and all I can say is WOW. It was delicious and just the right amount of sweet. We also ordered the Prosciutto, Egg & Smoked Mozz sandwich on the biscuit and the Roasted Mushroom Omelet. The biscuit was probably the best I've had. Seriously good and I've never had a sandwich like it. The omelet was great too and was a very generous portion. Make sure you try the breakfast potatoes too, I couldn't get enough of them.",

I ordered the Crab Rangoon and the Curry Noodle. The Crab Rangoon had very little stuffing in it and was essentially tasteless.  Most restaurants have a 1/2 to 1/2 ratio of wanton to stuffing, this didn't even come close. The Curry Noodle dish would have been decent, however, the noodles were terribly overcooked. I absolutely love rice noodle dishes, but these were so limp and tasteless I ended up throwing away most of the meal.  No one in my office would recommend Rearn Thai.",

Good for groups, for working, or just stopping in to have a coffee with friends. There are comfy couches and a big table / work space.\n\nThe SERVICE: the people aren't overly friendly but they're not the coffee snobs you'll find at a lot of other great places around the nation. I imagine I haven't had the chance to talk to the people behind the counter much because they're always super busy.\n\nIf you've never had Buddy Brew coffee and you like cold brew I'd definitely recommend stopping it to try!

They had socks for her to wear which was great. Then they had lots of awesome free snacks for her to enjoy too. They arrived about 9am which was perfect. Around 10 it started to get really busy. They only let so many people in at a time so then a line forms and as people leave they let others in. We will definitely be back!

  "text": "If you don't know by now, Tzin Wine and Tapas on 104 St in downtown Edmonton is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. Of all time. Not only is the food always delicious, the staff there are the definition of hospitality. There was a time when Joe and I went nearly every month and with us trying to eat out less and new restaurants opening all the time, Tzin slowly became a once in a while treat. We were able to visit earlier this month, and although it has taken me this long to write about it, the food still makes me drool just thinking about it.\n\nThe menu gets updated almost every couple of months, but hopefully this is still available. The grilled chorizo sausage is housemade with Irving Farm pork, with my first taste of it in the hot pot alongside tomatoes and gnocchi when I first started writing. It was nice to see it featured on its own, with simple sides of smoked garlic aioli, jalapeno jelly, and a violet mustard. A \"deconstructed hotdog\", in Chef McGuire's words. My favorite topping was the jalapeno jelly, and although similar in concept to Dadeo's infamous green jelly, definitely packing more heat and not as sweet. Tzin needs to start selling these in the alleyway, honestly.\n\nSecond to arrive was the baked brie with red wine reduction, a dish that has been on the menu since I've started dining here. With good reason too because it's one of my favorites. Although the dish has evolved in presentation in the past visits, it's still oozing creamy goodness. I much preferred the apple and Saskatoon berry compote on the side though! I like my cheese pure!\n\nNew on the menu for the month was a braised duck leg. It was super moist and beautifully done. The roasted and smoked potato puree stood out though and alongside the lentils, it was a solid accompaniment to the duck.\n\nThree dishes is our usual and we always save room for dessert. That night featured panna cotta stuffed poached pear and a chocolate mousse tart. I really couldn't decide between the two. I'm a chocolate lover, no doubts about that, but a refreshing, palate cleanser like a sorbet or lemon tart will always win me over. A panna cotta stuffed poached pear sounded interesting, but was it refreshing? My indecisiveness and Joe's indifference led us to allow Chef McGuire to choose the dessert for us. Surely he had a favorite. This is what happened next...\n\nBoth were served! Ahh why must you do this to me?! One bite of each and I could understand why though. Both had their merits and both would make me want to order more. The poached pear, served cold, was surprisingly very refreshing and the panna cotta, not heavy. It wasn't overly sweet either which is my preference for desserts! A \"cake waffle donut\" was served on the side, a cute concept. Moreso on the cake donut side, in a waffle shape, made from almond flour which makes it a fantastic gluten-free option for guests! Joe's favorite was the chocolate mousse, which we've had before. This time though, it was served with a chocolate cooking crumb crust and almond brittle. I really had to fight him for the last bite! (I already finished off the poached pear, haha!) Chef McGuire even remember Joe's \"allergy\" to peanuts and asked if the nuts were okay before plating. If you don't call that hospitality, I really don't know what is. Good call on both desserts!\n\nEvery meal ends with a quote slip with the bill. This particular quote was quite fitting for the night. Tzin Wine and Tapas, I will never forget what you did or said, and definitely never forget that you guys make me feel so happy! Food is superb, as always, and the service remains A+ as the team hasn't changed one bit. Except for Melissa's hair, which is now a short, chic bob! (She's the fabulous, upbeat server you will have alongside the equally fabulous Kelsey, owner of Tzin). Much thanks to Chef McGuire, as well as Sous Chef Greene, for the meal (and desserts!). Strongly considering ordering both desserts now for future meals. Maybe one to go.",

  "text": "The Yellow Submarine has been serving up sizeable sandwiches with a side of sass, sense of humor, and sarcasm for almost 40 years in the Reno-Sparks area! The story is a sweet one, and one I love to hear in our community. \n\nThe original owner had grown the business from one successful shop to three in about 20 years. When he decided to retire, he sold two and was approached by an employee who'd been there for almost 20 years who was interested in buying the original business. He told her to make an offer, so she did and, in response, he cut her number in HALF and said the place is yours! Rumor has it he's now off sailing the world, not in a submarine, but a photo of him on his boat sits up on a shelf watching over everything. I was told he still calls to check in and give the new owner a hard time, and I'm sure that's how this place has kept up the witty and gritty sarcastic vibe and spirit all these years. \n\nUnder that tough exterior is a business run on dedication, love, and camaraderie and you feel that as soon as you walk in. I showed up a little after 7 (they close at 8), and there was one other customer there picking up, what I learned was her usual Thursday order. The nice gal behind the counter made me feel right at home, and said she'd be with me ASAP. I went ahead and explored the shop a little more, which was when I noticed the half priced beer on Thursdays ($1.50!). I grabbed one and started looking at the fun trinkets, crafts, signs and photos all over the walls, including a large collection of Wizard of Oz memorabilia, all of which really give you a sense of who runs this place. \n\nWhen it was my turn to order, I was excited, and asked her what's good. She said the Yellow Sub was the way to go. This thing sounded like a monster with ham, salami, and pastrami, provolone and swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sprouts (I didn't get these), mayo, oil & vinegar, and parmesan cheese. I came in hoping for an Italian sub, so I asked to sub capicola for pastrami, which she was happy to do, and she even offered to sprinkle some oregano on for a little more Italian flair! I had seen the 12\" sub go home with the other lady, and it could feed 4, so I opted for the 6\" and it was massive! The bread was fresh and had that chewy texture I look for in a sub roll, the meat plentiful (at least 1/2lb!), and the veggies crisp and delicious with just the right amount of \"dressing\" from the oil & vinegar, parmesan, S&P and oregano.\n\nI'm amazed it took me almost 7 years to find it, but I'm so glad I took Yelper Amanda M's suggestion and went in last night. I will be back soon and I'll be bringing others to meet this institution face to face.",

  "text": "Our group of gals headed over to Tavern for a brunch while visiting Nashville for a bachelorette party. We were a party of five, and while we waited for a table, we found a back bar that was quieter than the main dining room chock-full of brunchers and bach parties ( I literally had no idea that Nashville was such a bach party destination). At this little back bar was one of the most chill bartenders, Rebekah, who took care of us with delicious bloody marys and bellinis (and much needed waters). During brunch, there is a two-for-one on their Brunch Libations which includes bloody marys, mimosas, bellinis, and sangria. Definitely worth it. \n\nWe opted to sit outside since the weather was pleasant. The prices are really fair especially since some of the dishes were massive. I split the Singapore Stir Fry with another gal, and my own dish seemed like one serving. I also got avocados to mash into it!  I do feel like this dish could've had more oomph of flavor, but maybe its toned down for the hoi polloi so ask for some hot sauce!  \n\nThe Maple Fondue is great to try a little bit of everything on their menu, and I love savory and sweet flavors together. Standout was the grilled spicy chicken sausage. Great for the whole table. \n\nNot sure if it was because we were outside, but our waitress (not Rebekah, but a different gal) was a bit MIA at times. Note to folks wanting to eat outside during the summer, at some point it will get warm, haha, so maybe bring a fan 'cause what's brunch without a cute fan. \n\nI'd definitely suggest this as a great spot to bring a group for brunch, and would be interested to check them out on a return visit for other eating hours and to peruse their beer selection! \n\n$11.50 SINGAPORE STIR FRY\n#1 short-grain rice / sunny side up eggs / bacon / scallions / sweet & spicy soy / wok-flavored\n\n$17 MAPLE FONDUE ( FOR THE TABLE)\nwarm maple syrup / fresh fruit / red velvet waffle / grilled sausages / pain perdu",

  "text": "I recently went to the Yelp Elite Event at Bartaco last month. I decided to bring my fiancé back here since I was given some bar token (1 bar token = 1 free taco) as part of a goodie bag from the event and because I think the food is awesome. We had a really sweet server named Regina K. I highly recommend the pomegranate lemonade that is made from scratch daily. One of the issues I had with the visit this time was that our lemonades took a long time to come out. The other issue I had was I asked the server if the $3.50 tacos counted as part of the free taco bar token and she thought it was, but our check only reflected the cheaper tacos ($2.50 ones) count towards the free taco token. No big deal, but I feel this is important information for anyone to know who has bar chips and what tacos would be completely free etc. I completely understand the reasoning behind that. My fiancé and I shared the guacamole, corn fritters, and empanadas for appetizers. Everything was so delicious - I think the corn fritters are the best, and I loved the sauce served its them. The tacos were wonderful of course, and I'm a big fan of the corn tortillas. For dessert, we each had the tres leches, which was awesome as well. I was expecting it to be a tiny portion size since Regina did mention it came in a mason jar, but it was actually a decent size. I look forward to bringing my future in laws here since they are foodies like me, and I know they will love it too!",

  "text": "In retrospect, I have to wonder if I was in St. Louis for a conference or for barbecue.  Well, I do guess both since I find myself scoping out places to eat whenever I travel.  In my black book of St. Louis eats, there were two barbecue joints, Pappy's and Bogart's. Barbecue is always at the top of my list.  Why should a visit to St. Louis be any different?\n\nWell, I lucked out this time.  After spending an hour and a half a few days before in Pappy's queue, I spent a mire 15 minutes in Bogart's.  I expected a huge line, but I guess we timed it just right.\n\nAs we viewed the menu, we realized that history had to repeat itself - we would have to go for the combo.  At Bogart's it's called the Old Joe Platter - a full slab of ribs, any 3 sandwiches, plus 4 sides. Again, two people had an uphill battle - another man versus food.\n\nIn addition to the ribs, our three sandwiches were the prime rib with grilled onions, pulled pork, and burnt ends. With that, we had cole slaw, deviled egg potato salad, baked beans, and the fire and ice pickles.  We were ready for a showdown.\n\nThe star was the ribs - nicely peppered, beautifully glazed, and finger-licking sticky. The ribs were super meaty, tender, juicy, and pulled off the bone with ease. These were, without a doubt, the best ribs I've ever had.\n\nAfter attacking the ribs, It was hard to enjoy the other sandwiches because I wanted more ribs.  The prime ribs was delicious, but it seemed to be out of place somehow; it may deserve a restaurant of its very own. Kiss Arby's goodbye if that happens.\n\nI enjoyed both the pulled pork and burnt ends.  But the ribs....the ribs! I hope you understand.\n\nOf the sides, there were two stars - the deviled egg potato salad and the fire and ice pickles.  The potato salad itself is familiar yet so very different.  Loved it!  The fire and ice pickles came out ice cold - that's the way to eat'em.  As they warm up, you can feel the heat a bit more intensely.  They were almost palate cleansing like pickled ginger at a Japanese restaurant.  Good eating!\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Pappy's barbecue, but Bogart's took it to another level.  The food is amazing and the service is even better.  No less than four people stopped by to check on us.  As we filed through the line, we were given smoky wings; a great meal starter. \n\nOverall, it was a real pleasant experience.  Too bad the 'Old Joe' did us in; we were able to finish it.  I ate the ribs first, though.",

Cafe Napoli came to our rescue and did a very fine job of it.  The service was fast and accurate.  They were very good at keeping water glasses filled and removing empty plates.  The menu was limited due to our circumstances, but actually made it easier to choose.  I had the Penne con Broccoli and it was outstanding.  I thought the house salad was perfect.  I would love to go back and try other things.",

The only thing I know about the place is that they have decent and forgettable custard that comes out partially melted. \n\nI love ice cream and custard and was genuinely excited (probably too much for someone approaching 30) to be served a concrete upside down but I received a partially melted cup of custard the normal way. I have had better ice cream/custard at a variety of other places. I wonder if after so many years, they are just relying on their reputation.",

Ample parking, which is somewhat rare for Tampa. \n\nThe donuts were shockingly small but most were pretty tasty with good texture. At least they weren't overpriced for the size, which some donut places are. The strawberry cheesecake donut was strong on strawberry but lacking in cheesecakiness. The fruity pebble and apple pie were the favorites. \n\nDidn't appreciate the jesus music that was blaring through the whole time though.

  "text": "I had a chance to swing by the new Barking Buffalo Cafe last week, a small grab-and-go coffee space paired with local fashion brand Salgado Fenwick. Coffee and fashion all in one space? It's not an unusual concept but definitely a presentation of two visions bringing more life to the growing 124 Street district.\n\nThe space was previously home to Parkhill Vision Care, with the downstairs space being used as Salgado Fenwick's workshop. The upstairs became vacant last winter and Salgado Fenwick owners Linda Ritter and Shauna Force figured, why not? As lovers of coffee, they joined forces with Kassie Burkholder to bring you Barking Buffalo Cafe. Throw in Elliot Kerr, previously at Duchess Bakeshop, to help behind the bar and tada!\n\nThe space is gorgeous, a display and shop of Salgado Fenwick's fashions, complete with change rooms. Custom woodworking done by Oleson Woodshop in Regina gives Barking Buffalo Cafe, a fitting cabin-feel as most of the clothing have animal-inspired silkscreened prints. Head towards the back and you can actually see the cutting and sewing spaces for the shop which is pretty cool. The space extends even past the workshop, currently up for debate as to what it will become in the future.\n\nA few tables line the side wall, although the space is meant for a grab-and-go (or shop!) cup. Loved that they're serving Toronto's Pilot Coffee Roasters, a new roast to me and a welcomed one at that. I'm all about variety! Almond milk is a default here, a vegetarian/vegan friendly staple and for those sick and tired of paying the extra cost for the substitute. For those of us who like our regular milk, don't worry, just ask! Muffins and granola bars are also available for munching.\n\nCongrats to Barking Buffalo Cafe on their opening! For a different cup of coffee and a chance to check out a great space, head up a little further 124th street to pay them a visit. Open late on Thursday nights, you can also pop by during the 124 Grand Market.",

  "text": "I'm a big fan of the Hawkers in the Mills 50 area of Orlando, so I had really high hopes for the St Pete incarnation. The atmosphere is great. The owners completely gutted Taps and Tequila and the new space is light, airy and open. A garage door opens to a patio, which is where our table of 8 was seated. We probably should have known better than to bring such a large party so close to the grand opening, but we did it anyway. The food was great, I had the Summer Rolls, which were huge, and Char Kway Tao, a personal favorite. We ordered lots of the naan, which everyone enjoyed. The service was spotty to say the least. They were out of the sparkling sake on the menu, our server kept forgetting things, and on at least one occasion they brought us someone else's food. The server admitted that they were having a problem with runners just leaving the kitchen with food and not checking the tickets, which is kind of concerning. We ordered sake bombs for the table- 3 Kirins and 4 bottles of sake, roughly. When it came time to pay, the server could not figure out how to break up the sake bombs (how does an asian restaurant NOT have something for this on their POS system?). At this point we had been there almost three hours! I got frustrated and just paid for the whole thing, as I was not going to waste any more time on $35. Long story short, I will be back to try again soon with a smaller party because I'm loyal to Hawkers and I do love the food. I really do hope they get the service under control, though, as I have never had these problems at the Hawkers in Orlando",

But in the end we always go to Han Dynasty. \n\nI really love the food at Han Dynasty. But just as a warning, be prepared to go into a food coma after eating here because the food is really oily. My personal favorites are the Dan Dan Noodles and Eggplant with Garlic Sauce. The food is pretty spicy. Each dish comes with a spice rating from 1-10. But if you can't handle too much spice, you can ask them to tone the spice down to a lower number. \n\nIf you have a big party, you can get a table in the back that has a Lazy Susan on it. The tables in the back are also semi-private. \n\nWaiters are always prompt and friendly. Ambiance is casual. Over, just a great place for lunch or dinner with friends.",

But, in comparison to the general population, I don't get half as excited as ya'll do when it comes to the savory pie. It might be even better to describe me as a pizza snob. The kind of person who gets all razzled for pizzas that have toppings like prosciutto, arugula or sun dried tomatoes. Snob. You won't find me knocking at the door of Pizza Hut or Pizza King. However, if I'm in Italy - I'm eating pizza. And, if I'm in Indy, I'm eating Bazbeaux (conveniently located in my neighborhood).  \n\nI think it's the wide variety of available veggies that makes me love Bazbeaux so much. Last night, I opted for the new \"Fresh Pizza\" - pesto/olive oil in place of pizza sauce, arugula, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella (sliced), basil with added garlic and proscuitto. I was a little bummed that I didn't opt for the larger size because by the final slice, my friends and I were passing it like a pipe...just oneeee moooorrreeee bitteeee... The cherry on top? BP carries H20 Sushi's soheartyitsgottabehealthy,right? Shagbark cookies. If you haven't had one, stop waiting.

I really liked the service I received from Andy Mohr Toyota but I grew to hate my corolla. After coming close to getting in a serious car accident, I was desperate to end my lease early and get into something bigger and safer. I was super picky about what I wanted but knew I wanted an affordable suv with 3rd row seating. To get my garage spot I told my fiancé my car would need remote start and heated seats. We found the affordable Volkswagen Tiguan online and decided to check it out. \n\nWe were greeted at Andy Mohr Volkswagen with smiles and phenomenal customer service. Tyler was patient with our indecisiveness as he walked us around the entire lot to look at every Tiguan they had as we compared every small detail. We decided on the Tiguan SEL and I absolutely LOVE it. Tyler was patient and understanding when we asked for some time to think about all of our options. Once we decided on the perfect one Tyler walked us through all of the paperwork in an easy to understand way. He used his time wisely and explained the features of the car to us while we waited for someone to finalize all of the paperwork for us. \n\nThey called to make sure I was loving my new car and were there to answer any little question I had. When I returned the spare keys to my old car, they greeted us by name. I work at a school and we collected toys for tots but we weren't a drop off location so I asked if we could drop off the toys at their store. They were so excited and helped us carry in the multiple boxes of toys we had for them. \n\nI did have to take my car in the get the latch in the driver side door tightened up and they were sure to get me in quickly. Again I was greeted with smiles and was called by name. They thanked me again for all of the toys we donated and were quick to get my car fixed. While i waited in their computer waiting area they even washed my car for me. If you need a new car I would highly suggest heading to Andy Mohr Volkswagen and asking for Tyler.

We started with a traditional appetizer - pork skins in gelatin. A chilled dish which was not to my taste but many in the group loved. We were paraded with dish after dish of flavorful favorites of my friend's - crispy eggplant, sautéed pea shoots, egg-battered shrimp, and for the adventurer: some sort of organ stew, complete with a broth which encorporated pig's blood (waste not,want not, right?). The latter was not to my taste, but I was grateful to try so many traditional favorites. And he was thrilled to show them off! I will recommend cate zone to anyone. \n\nA few notes - service is good, and fast, but the place is small and popular so your guaranteed to wait and don't expect to linger long after dinner. The atmosphere is bare bones. They just got a liquor license, they offer a single Chinese beer that you won't want to miss.

  "text": "*drum roll please*\n\nI will be the very first to confess that I am not a coffee drinker. I never got used to the taste of coffee, although I do like the smell of freshly-brewed coffee. What I do enjoy is a place to visit with friends, sip a beverage of my choosing, and relax in a comfortable \"homey\" environment.\n\nSips Specialty Coffee House is just such a place, located along Gunn Highway near Citrus Park. You'll find Sips in a little strip mall out in front of Super WalMart and down the block from an Amscot financial center. It's right at the intersection of Gunn and Henderson Road.\n\nWalking in the front door I had to do a double-take because I thought that I'd stepped back into my mother's kitchen. You could smell all of the wonderful scents of baked goods, along with the flavors of coffee and toppings. There were people sitting at tables, sipping their drinks, playing cards, board games, laughing, and chattering away. The decorations were definitely right in line with what my Mom would have placed around her kitchen.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet the owners, Caryn and Ken Reed, and learn a bit about their journey from Michigan to Florida, and the idea for their coffee house which opened six months ago. Very nice, down-to-earth people who are looking to provide that comfy neighborhood gathering place for people to meet up, play a game of Jenga or chess, and do a bit of networking. \n\nOh yes, and enjoy that coffee - hot, iced, blended, frozen - you name it. The house special is Sips Mocha which is made with white chocolate, swirls of caramel, steamed milk & espresso. They have lattes and mochas and cappuccinos and espressos, fruit smoothies, hot teas, iced teas, and your regular ol' cup o' Joe. There's also a refrigerated case with fruit juices, soda, and bottled water.\n\nThey have a baked goods counter with bagels, muffins and pastries, and these AMAZING homemade dark chocolate cupcakes with Reese's cups inside.  YUMMMMM!!!!\n\nFor those who are on the go and don't want to climb out of your car, then Sips has a drive-up, full-service window. You can get a single-serving cup, or pick up one of their containers of coffee for the office.\n\nNow one final treat -- especially for us Yelpers. Sips happens to employ the very lovely and sweet Ms. Cece C. as a barrista, and I highly encourage you to stop in and say Hi to her.\n\nYes, I understand, there are a lot of places where you can stop for coffee, but not many places offer this type of cozy atmosphere. It is worth the time to stop and make some new friends while enjoying a great cup of......well, I was gonna say tea, but y'all would probably like the coffee a whole lot too.",

  "text": "Really a great Salon! I got my hair cut by Jessica, and she is the sweetest stylist you will ever meet. I got acquainted to the salon via Yelp, and was definitely willing to try it despite the distance from my house based on the reviews and positive comments. \n\nOnce I got there, I parked on a side street (free, 2am-8pm for 2 hours only) which was  no trouble at all and walked a block to the salon. The area is different from what I was expecting, seeing as this was my first time in this part of town, seemed a little...grubby. However, the salon was presentable, and almost had a little bit of a hipster vibe (it IS organic, anyway) which I was comfortable with. They dont have state of the art decor and furniture, but I liked the homey feel and their vintage pieces and the ease at which the clients and hair stylists moved around. I was offered a drink, and sat to get my hair washed, cut and dried, all for $35. Very affordable, especially for me! She listened to all my concerns and then gave me a nice trim and updated my current cut for the look I wanted. Nothing bad to say about the entire experience. I loved the little scalp massage during the wash too!\n\nDefinitely a good experience and I'd likely come back in the future to get my hair cut again, but do wish it was a little closer to home.",

  "text": "Blondie's makes me wish I still worked downtown. It is a great addition to Washington and I've been (mostly) impressed the two times I've been. First just for drinks late on a Saturday. Other than 2-3 other small parties, the place was quiet. I was really surprised considering how busy everything else seemed to be. The decor is brilliant - cozy, comfortable, and practical. It's a mix of normal dining tables along with armchairs and sofas. Since we weren't ordering food we were able to relax by the fire. Nice!\n\nI was also there for lunch on Saturday and the food was delicious. I tried the veggie sandwich and the turkey, green apple, mayo sandwich. Both came on a plain popover which made them impossible to eat with your hands. They were closer to an open-faced sandwich. Which leads me to my first complaint - the paper than they cover the plates with. Makes no sense at all. The sauce from the sandwiches quickly made the paper soggy and since I had to eat with utensils I was carving up the paper along with my sandwich. It was really annoying and impossible not to do. But that's an easy fix. The veggie was world's better than the turkey and this is only the second time ever I've raved about a veggie sandwich. You get either chips or fruit as a side and the chips come in a generous portion.\n\nMy other complaint is service was really, really slow. Slow to order, really slow to get our food (even though, again, there were only 3 other tables occupied), and we never did get our check delivered. We eventually went up front to pay. If service is like this during the work week, I can't imagine who would continue to go here.\n\nBig bonus points for playing TCM on the TV's. But not cool that they have two bathrooms, both of which are unisex. Please make one a boy's and one a girl's. I hate using a public restroom after a guy. Gross.\n\nBut overall I love this place and it seems to work equally well as a lunch spot or late night hangout, which few places can do.",

  "text": "Really cool spot with both indoor and outdoor seating area. Friendly staff and they cell cigars! We got a flight and bought a cigar and enjoyed the beautiful weather outside.\n\nFlight of 4:\nBlueberry Prussia - fairly tart but paired very well with the cigar which cut it down. You can definitely get the Blueberry notes and it was pretty good.\nCast Iron Brown - I love brown Ales and definitely one of the better ones I've tasted. Kind of toasty, not over powering and easy to drink.\nNitro Irish Stout - As a Nitro Stout, you definitely get that creaminess and it is pretty good as well. Not my favorite of the four but all the beers were good here.\nAbsence of Light - I loved this one, the mix of peanut butter, chocolate and caramel are well balanced and it is smooth and delicious. This was probably my favorite one.\n\nGreat place and a cool vibe. Small parking lot here and some street parking around. They also sell food but we didn't order any. Definitely would come back and try more beers and the food!",

  "text": "I love trying new places (especially my fav, SUSHI!) so we decided to give Kabuki off of Manchester a try after hearing rave reviews from friends.  We came in on a Friday night and the place was about half full, and we were seated quickly by a very sweet hostess.  We ordered a miso soup and their spicy soup (can't remember the name..) and both were really good.  The spicy soup is VERY spicy though, just to warn you!  Our waitress was very nice and attentive and made sure to keep stopping by if we needed refills.  We ordered a few plain rolls (which are usually always my favorite) like the tuna and yellowtail, and both were great.  We also ordered the tiger roll which was probably my favorite.  It's wrapped in pink soy paper and the flavors were delicious.  The Alaska roll was also wonderful.  I thought the sushi was very fresh, beautifully presented and their rice wasn't too overpowering or sweet (don't you hate when that happens??).  That being said, my only complaint was that for the price, I thought the rolls would be larger and we would have had more food.  I've heard their HH is great with cheap prices on drinks and select rolls, and we will definitely be back to check it out!",

  "text": "I went to Fogo for my bf's birthday last week, and it was very, very good! We got there 15 minutes after our reservation time (oops), but they seated us right away (it was a Thursday night and not horribly busy.) The servers came over right away to explain how it works. Basically, you have a small disc that is red on one side and green on the other. When you are ready to eat, you flip it to green. If you need a break, you flip it to red, and they won't offer you anything. There are chefs circling the tables, each with a different type of meat on a giant skewer. If you want that meat, they'll cut off a piece for you. You can do this as many times as you want. It's almost like dim sum, for those familiar with that type of dining.\n\nI love that the food service began immediately, because everything was pretty much already cooked. They brought out the sides, which were polenta (just eh, but I'm not really into that), mashed potatoes (ok, but nothing special), and fried bananas (sweet mother of fried fruits, that was GREAT.) Just based on the sides, my review wouldn't have been that stellar, but then the meats started going around...\n\nWe started with the Parmesan-crusted pork, which was very salty but really good. I got that one a couple more times later on. I also really liked the bacon-wrapped filet Mignon. Boyfriend was practically hunting down the chef with the Picanha, which is a top sirloin and the house specialty. I didn't like that one as much, but he was getting a little obsessive about it. Everything else was good but not incredibly memorable. \n\nI should also mention that I ordered 2 Caipirinhas during the dinner service. It's the national drink of Brazil. I wasn't crazy about the first one--it was just the original recipe and kind of strong in an acidic way. The second one was the Passionfruit version, and that was delicious. They were both very strong, alcohol-wise, which is how I like my drinks!! They were also pretty darn expensive, but that's to be expected, I guess.\n\nFinally, dessert. We got the chocolate molten lava cake with ice cream. There's really no way you can go wrong with that, and it was delicious. Just make sure to save room for dessert after all that meat.\n\nOne thing--it's expensive (over $150 just for bf and me), but it'd be pretty hard not to expect that going into it. The only thing is that there really isn't a menu, so you can't keep track of how everything adds up. Overall, though, we had a really great experience and will probably be back. I also got my dad (another steak-lover) a gift certificate there for Father' Day.",

  "text": "This is a nice hike, I\"m not sure exactly where the trail gears off too the only sign of it is at the entrance.  I crossed the tracks and headed to the beach, they have a sign posted it's where the sea lions gather between December and May and they close the beach access off between those months.  You would be able to see the sea lions from the cliff with their pups.  The day I went hiking we just walked along the ocean as the little ones gathered their shells and we walked from one end to the only other way out and hiked back along the bluff from the parking lot (no sign posted)  the trail is surrounded by chrub.  It eventually goes along side a rail road track and we saw the train twice while hiking.  When we came back I saw people walking on the other side of the train track in a field which I thought was private property but I\"m guessing where the trail head actually is.  Either way, both sides of the track is a nice hike.  It was empty when we went exploring the area. Saw some people hang gliding above us.   I loved the quietness and I only saw one jogger when I got to the train area.  The beach access itself is empty just a few joggers and at the parking lot entrance at the far end of the beach is where some people gathered but it's a nice quiet beach area over all.  Total distance we did was 6-7 miles.",

  "text": "The northside has a great, little place for nabbing some Korean! Don't be fooled by the biz name \"I Love Salad\". This hole-in-the-wall Korean cafe has plenty more to choose from than just leafy greens and veggies, including crossan'wiches, wraps, soups, classic Korean entreés, fro yo, and boba tea! That's a lot. I don't typically recommend restaurants that have an overly large menu because it indicates they're trying too many things and may not do any one thing particularly well. But, I Love Salad's Korean options were decent. Not to mention, when you see that the local Koreans are also fans (and it's not just hipster Caucasians that frequent a place), you know it's probably going to be a good one.\n\nMy hubby and his friends nabbed the bibimbap with beef, which is served steaming hot in the traditional stone pot. I tried a bit and it had good flavor and texture and a fair amount for a grown man to polish off. Their bibimbap is not quite as good as that which is served at a few of the other traditional Korean BBQ places on the eastside, but it will definitely hit the spot if you're in the area and have a taste for bulgogi. The bibimbap meal comes with a small bowl of miso soup. That was quite nice -- not too salty and contained a fair amount of tofu and scallions instead of just the broth.\n\nI went for the bento box with salmon...mmmm...and it was tasty. They drizzled a lovely teriyaki BBQ on the fish and nestle it on top of some fresh greens. The fish portion was decent and not overcooked (I definitely used my finger to lap up the sauce haha.) The box also comes with a beautifully colorful side salad (complete with fresh strawberries, red bell peppers, and cukes...I love a nice, colorful salad), a hefty portion of rice, and four lightly pan fried dumplings. The dumplings were perfect! I dislike when dumplings are fried to oblivion and as a result overly tough in the skin. These didn't even need the soy sauce to dip in.\n\nI would have liked to have nabbed me some boba tea or fro yo, but I filled up on the delicious rice and salmon. So, that just means another visit is in order. Perhaps then I can try some of their not-so-traditional / non-Korean menu items as well.\n\nMy advice to the business owner: you should consider tidying up your dining area (the many stacks of Korean magazines up by the window are unnecessary and make the space seem cluttered and overwhelming), and try to keep your food prep space that is visible to customers a little more organized. It sends a certain message to your customers about the cleanliness and preparedness of your restaurant.",

It is a bit overwhelming because the menu is set over the middle of the food, but if you just stand back and look for a minute you should be good to go. The produce section is next and it is beautiful. They have everything you find in a regular grocery, plus things I've only seen there. I love it! The isles are fun- again a mix of the usual and the imported/unusual. But my absolute favorite part is the meat counter. The meats are gorgeous and the prices are great.

  "text": "Those that know me well are quite aware of my low aptitude for beer. Sure I know my wines, but now, I'm thinking it's time to really understand beer. With the beer boom going on in the old pueblo, I don't tire of seeing more breweries hop on the scene, and Ten Fifty-Five Brewing is doing many things well! This small operation started out in a home kitchen and has wowed locals since it's debut in Tucson. They have four beers in constant rotation and plan to have six by November. And so far, so good! Actually, great! What I find especially great is the variety. They really make beer for many palates to enjoy. I typically steer away from IPAs, so lucky for me, the Lazy Duck (American Wheat) and Leap Pale Ale are light and crisp. The Leap Pale Ale is their flagship brew and in my humble opinion, a perfect beer for those that don't want a super hoppy beer. It's just the right amount! I tasted two other beers in my flight, which are not necessarily going to always be available in their rotation. The XOXO Coffee Stout (made with coffee beans from EXO Roasters) and the Pukka Bitter (British style Ale). I enjoyed both. They also make a double IPA, the Two Sons Citra, which was sold out. As mentioned earlier, this operation is quite small and carefully run by two owners, John Vyborny and Chris Squires. Both are super passionate about their craft and they're pouring some mad love into their nano-brews. Tasting hours are limited, so make sure to visit them Thursday and Friday 4pm-7pm and Saturday 2pm-7pm. They've recently expanded their space and now have more seating, a huge chalkboard menu and a tasting bar. Stop by and have flight! Meet the owners and have a chat. While small, it's cozy and welcoming and all beer drinkers-beginning or expert will be in a hoppy (pun intended) place upon first sip. Prices start at $2 for 6oz pours, growlers are $8. If you can't make it into the brewery for a visit, you can find their beer at several local restaurants including Playground, The Good Oak, La Cocina, Tap & Bottle, Zona 78 Hacienda del Sol, Pasco and Wilko. Cheers!",

The portion sizes are generous: 8 pieces of crab rangoon in an order, a full cup of hot & sour soup as a lunch side, etc.  They always remember spicy mustard packets for me, too!  I don't know where the love is for spicy mustard, but you only get them now if requested at most places.  Delivery is quick, always right about the time they estimate.\n\nThe food itself is fairly average Chinese delivery.  The filling of the crab rangoon is a little sweet for me- not tender crab sweet, but leaning towards cheesecake sweet.  They have several flavors of egg roll that are tasty, if over-fried a bit like egg rolls sometimes can be.  Yummy steamed dumplings.  \n\nFor my meal, I order spicy entrees like kung pao beef and spicy chicken.  They are different every time time I get them, so not great consistency.  Some of my coworkers take understandable issue when an unexpected veggie or spice shows up in a dish where it typically is not used. To top the meal off, the brand of fortune cookies they use is delicious- sweet, crispy, and airy.  I usually can't even eat a fortune cookie, but I like to polish off a couple of these!",

I love eating spicy foods so was pleasantly surprised that a medium would actually burn my mouth a bit. I ordered a pound of head on shrimp in the boil house sauce which is essentially all the seasonings/sauces, medium spicy. We also shared half a dozen of the char grilled oysters. Others had the mussels + shrimp no spice, shrimp po boy sandwich, salad, fettuccine noodles, fire brussels sprouts. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The restaurant was empty when we arrived on a Sunday lunch but slowly started to fill up closer to 1pm. Still plenty of tables available. \n\nWe got our foods within a decent amount of time. My pound of shrimp was pretty small - a pound of shrimp in the bay comes with much more shrimp... fortunately I wasn't too hungry and it was enough to fill me up. I think others would need double the portion to get full. The char grilled oysters came with cheesy/garlic toppings! It was really good and had the right amount of flavors. The shrimp seasoning was salty and tasty - I enjoyed the spice and sauces... especially the chunks of garlic. The fire brussels sprouts were crispy and delicious. It had a tiny kick of spice to it. Overall I enjoyed the seafood boil here and would definitely be back here if I'm in the area.",

  "text": "I honestly can't say enough about Pauly's Bar Room, formerly Rick's Press Room, in downtown Meridian. When we were new in town, we were looking for those local hangouts, the neighborhood bars and Yelp gave Pauly's a great rating. From the first 5 minutes we were there, everyone was super welcoming. The bartenders and the patrons were chatty with us, which we love, the drinks were stiff and the beers were cold served in chilled glasses. Since that first visit, we have been back many times, on our way to becoming regulars. I have to say their daily and nightly food specials are amazing. They have some hard working talented cooks at Pauly's. We've had meatloaf, prime rib, tacos, then regular menu items like burgers and tots and such. Everything is good. I actually check their Facebook page regularly to see what the specials are. They have a Sunday Brunch which is pretty popular, although the regular menu isn't available until after brunch.. I do think food and drinks are fairly priced too. Overall, if you are looking for a friendly, local, not stuffy bar, check out Pauly's!",

  "text": "Expect to leave super stuffed! After a few people suggested we check out Palace of Asia, we decided to head over one night while we were craving Indian food. We arrived during dinnertime expecting it to be crowded but it was empty. Inside, the decor was very pretty. It was nicely decorated and had lovely fixtures and rugs. The servers aren't the friendliest out there, but they weren't rude either. \n\nWe ordered garlic naan, chicken vindaloo and chicken tikka masala. The two entrees came with a side of rice. Everything was absolutely delicious and the portions were huge. The quality of the food here is phenomenal and we were incredibly full after we left. Everyone I know who has come here commented about how full they left. Come on an empty stomach and enjoy!",

  "text": "Mid century modern diner in blue and white, just east of downtown. Hipster staff and locally sourced upscale casual fare. Eclectic cocktail menu  with a good selection of wine and craft brew. Open 7 days a week from 7am to 2am. Serves food til 2:00am. That's special for Tucson. Face it, Tucson is an older town and most of the folks hit the early bird special and are tucked in by 9:00pm. So being able to get food late from other than a chain or fast food joint is special. We shared the Mac N Cheese with Andouille for an apply  and got the Jambalaya and No Way Jose burger, also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts for our entrees. All delish. In addition to the menu items, there are daily drink and food specials; and a Happy Hour. Awesome! We want to try this place for breakfast. Love the vibe, love the food. This place is special.",

  "text": "I moved to the neighborhood almost 3 months ago and have spent a lot of time visiting either Home Depot or this store. I was giddy to come across this Ace which is a fantastic alternative to HD or Lowes. I am there so often they always recognize me. All of the employees are helpful whenever I needed something or had questions. I have gone there to buy plants, seeds, brackets, drill bits, nails/screws, soil, planters, bug spray, you name it. I love walking by the store to take a look at the latest plants. I find the cost of plants is comparable to Home Depot. One of the ladies that works there is always so helpful helping me choose which plants are suited for the weather, shade, etc. One day, since I was buying a bunch of plants, she sweetly gave one of the clearance small plants to my daughter and explained how to take care of it. Another day, when my daughter was with me, another woman cashing us out gave my daughter a coloring book. Very thoughtful. \n\nThere are some things that you can definitely get cheaper elsewhere (this was true when I was pricing ladders), but for the most part, the prices are comparable and oh so convenient for those of who live in the neighborhood. You can't beat it.",

  "text": "I have been craving for really good South Indian food . As soon as I moved to Indianapolis, I looked for the restaurants in the evening and this was the only place which offer dinner buffet. I dropped in this place for dinner with my friend and needless to say, the restaurant was smelling all curry and I loved the aroma. They were still setting up the dishes for the dinner buffet but they told us to grab the plates and hog on! We were like Hell Yeah !! Let's do it !\n\nThe items on the buffet were great. I think it was a huge spread but it's quite common if you drop into an Indian restaurant for buffet. There was two kinds of soup - chicken soup and tomato soup which I didn't try. I always recommend people to stay away from soups at Indian restaurants. Moving on.. There was my favorite South Indian food - Vada [ pro tip: they look like small donuts but they are not sweet] , and they were awesome, I had almost 10 of them. There were four kinds of chutneys, every chutney was perfect. They had delicious sambar too.  [pro tip : you generally have Vada's with chutney and sambar. Especially coconut chutney] They had Potato fry [aloo fry], egg plant curry, panner makhani [paneer butter masala], veg Manchurian and couple more vegetarian dishes. They all were fantastic.\n\nComing to the non- vegetarian section, they have chicken makhani [chicken butter masala], lamb curry, tandoori chicken, chicken dum biryani. I didn't try the lamb curry but the chicken dum biryani was great. [pro tip: add some chicken makhani to your chicken biryani rice and have it, it's so yummy]. The tandoori chicken was not so great. I don't understand why several Indian restaurants get this dish wrong. They add plenty of food color which spoils the taste of the dish and make it look red and dark pink in color. It's ridiculous. Please get this right!! \n\nThey had carrot halwa, couple of ice creams and fresh cut fruits in the desserts section. \n\nThey serve any kind of naan and roti and Dosa's at your table if you tell the server. [pro tip: Dosa is a South Indian dish and they look little like pan cakes and some people even refer them as Indian pan cakes. And again they are not sweet like pan cakes. You eat them with chutneys and sambar or with potato curry ] \n\nI really had a very good time having the food at this place. I do recommend this restaurant. I will definitely go there again.",

  "text": "Oh look it's 5 years later  and it's time for an update. The owner has transitioned from father to son in the last few years, so there have actually been some changes at this venerable restaurant. The dining room looks the same, only spruced up...same for the bar. The menu has some different items on it and some of them are actually healthy. I know it's a shock.\n\nI recently enjoyed a Tales of the Cocktail lunch at Tujague's. It was 3 courses and a Sazerac for around $25. And it was delicious. I had a lovely salad, a beautiful piece of fish and then bread pudding, of course. Oh and I almost ate an entire loaf of french bread by myself because it was warm and tasty.\n\nThe staff was great and even let me charge my phone near their station (no plugs in the antique dining room). I'm glad to see them still going strong.",

That may make little difference when you walk in, then maybe it's just your normal Chinese food place but there you go.  I did order the St. Paul sandwich, something I had been looking forward to since I clicked I'm in.  It had been years since I had my first and only one and while I remember it being just a blob of a sandwich, it was a good memory.  I loved this one ... messy, the mayo, pickles, all falling apart, filled the right spot that night.  I also ordered the pot stickers that were pretty good.  It seems like most others liked there food but I also have rarely been to any similar place that stands out.  Not worth a special trip but if you are nearby, why not.",

  "text": "So happy with this place. I had to find a new nail tech recently as mine has moved away, and I felt like such a dweeb for never noticing this place across from The Fashion Mall. I love it! I only get my acrylics done here now and might I add, for an extremely reasonable price. The facility itself is very clean, they have a really nice selection of polishes and services, and my nails are beautiful every time. For those people who are anal about finger nail polish and symmetry: this place has it on point for the most part. Really thankful to have found this lil gem. Highly recommend. The service providers are always very sweet however the end result of your nail service can be, every so often, a little off. I think that could just be with acrylics though, since a lot of people don't do them anymore it seems. Hasn't hindered my desire to return, but my advice is ask for whomever makes you happiest if you're recurring! And mind you, this is barely worth mentioning but a possibility.",

  "text": "They have several pop-up restaurants through out the week.  My favorite being Pirate pizza Friday and apparently Saturday's too now.\n\nBut besides the pizza, I really like this place.  Its got a neighborhood bar kinda feel without the creepiness of a dive bar. Its the modern day Cheers basically...and who doesn't love Cheers? \n\nThe layout is a little odd but the space is what it is.  Its a long narrow bar with small tables against the wall and a row of tables beside the bar which are only for overflow. Every time I've sat there, the poker players arrive and I'm suddenly in their way.  There is also a room in the back with a pool table.  I've honestly never been back there.  Maybe on a busy weekend people might use it.  The jukebox has tons of classics.  Usually a familiar tune playing when you're sippin' on your drink.   \n\nThe same bartender is always there when I go in on various days of the week.  I like seeing the same face. She makes great recommendations like the Pear Martini which is now my go-to drink and shes the happiest person I've ever seen working.  So nice and always smiling.  Love her! \n\nAlthough its not a fancy cocktail lounge, they happen to make some great mixed drinks.\n\n-1star for the smoking, although they have filters which help keep the smoke to a minimum, you still leave smelling like an ashtray.",

I love mine with nuts and raisins. Get there early while they are still nice and warm and the store gals will cut you off a trio. \n\nTheir powdered cream donuts are arguably the best ever. Don't believe me? Try for yourself. \n\nFor the more adult palette, try the almond horns dipped in chocolate at the tips. Chewy, dense almond flavor. Mmm. \n\nAlso an early sell-out every day are the boxes of mini Danish...what better way to sample all the flavors?\n\nLastly, birthday cakes are stocked in case and also made to order. I say go with the pound cake and vanilla buttercream icing. Their classic combo and, in my opinion, what they do best. \n\nAround the holidays, lines are out the door, so be patient, embrace the festive chaos and give a big smile to the girl covered in powdered sugar behind the counter...chances are she has been up since 3 AM boxing YOUR cream puffs. :)",

I went with a friend as part of our 'ladies who lunch' series, and we had an incredible time. We each startred with a beer (surprisingly good draft list for an Asian restaurant) and split the dumplings in chili oil. Although I'm not usually a pork fan, the chili oil was too good to pass up, and the dumplings disappeared in a matter of moments! We also had a hilarious struggle eating the dumplings with our chopsticks, much to the amusement of our waitress (who was awesome). \n\nFor entrees, I had the dry pepper style with chicken (adding extra veggies for no upcharge), and my friend had the double cooked style pork. I didn't get a chance to try hers, but mine was so good! Not too much sauce, the heat level was perfect (per the recommendation of our server), and everything cooked beautifully. I actually could not have asked for a better lunch.\n\nIn the past I've had the dry pot style with chicken, as well as the spicy cucumbers, and both were also amazing. Needless to say, I haven't had a bad meal here!\n\nAs a side note, our server was Minjung, and she was probably one of the best servers I've ever had in my life (no joke) - friendly, attentive (but not overly so), and made sure we had a great experience.",

The bartender was very nice and took her time to explain the menu offerings. We really liked that most of their food, sauces etc are made in house. \n\nWe both started with a beer (love the local beer offerings!) The one thing I didn't quite get was that the beer was served in a plastic cup. I get why they'd do that after hours once a rowdier crowd comes in, but not in the early afternoon. \n\nWe both split the nachos and they were SOOOO GOOD!! Like I'm not even kidding. From the chicken, to the BBQ sauce and everything in between, I highly recommend the nachos!! It was plenty for 2 people and honestly we couldn't even finish it between us. YUM!!!\n\nThe interior of Ole Red is definitely a step above the rest. The stage was awesome and they had a bluegrass band playing the whole time. There are multiple levels and a rooftop bar, but unfortunately the rooftop was closed when we were there so we didn't get to see it.",

She did as well as she could.\n\nI was not pleased with my steak at all. I didn't mention it since it seemed like it was a rough night for the staff and I didn't want to make it worse for them. (Having worked in a restaurant for 8 years prior to my current job at a bank, I am extra considerate of the service industry.)\n\nThe steak was one of the worst I've had and I will probably never get it again. It tasted strange (like it may have been past date), it had some dryness and toughness to it (a ribeye should be juicy), and it could have been seasoned better. The baked potato that came it was fine.\n\nMy wife got the grilled chicken breast with mixed veggies, the portion was nice, but the chicken was over seasoned and had a little spiciness to it.\n\nWe got the stuffed artichoke appetizer which we love and have never been disappointed with it.\n\nWe will go back to this place because we generally have had good experiences there in the past, but I'm not getting the steak again. I'll stick with their other dishes, I've had better luck with their daily specials.\n\nThis 2 star review is only based on tonight's visit.

The fried oysters are also fantastic and extraordinarily fresh! The wings are pretty good, but I felt like the lemon pepper flavor was a bit overwhelming and salty. Good quality chicken though. The fries are nearly perfect!\n\nThe house-made ranch and bleu cheese dressings that accompanied the wings, fried pickles, and chicken strips were very, very, very good!!! I love it when a restaurant offers a great house-made ranch (shout out to McDougal's in Hillsboro Village) and Jefferson's does it very well!\n\nThe only thing I would change is the batter for the fried pickles and the oysters.

The sushi burrito anxiety was real and it took me awhile to try it. If you feel like this, don't worry. It is not that scary. \n\nThe Spot is combined with Ha Long Bay. You can actually order Pho with your sushi burrito! Anyway, if you walk into \"The Spot\" side of the restaurant, you will see that you order your burrito like you would a certain fast food Mexican burrito.\n\nFirst you pick burrito, bowl or salad. Then you pick your protein. You can pick two or three for a higher price. Then you pick sauce, veggies, and toppings. Then you watch your beauty be wrapped into a burrito. \n\nI ordered a burrito with salmon and tempura shrimp (I highly recommend both). I then asked about the sauce and was recommended the spicy sauce since I am a heat fiend. I added cucumber, carrots, and jalapenos. I then added sesame seeds and little crunch wontons for texture. \n\nSome of the things that you could also add that I remember were tuna, corn, cilantro, red onion, avocado (upcharge), asparagus (upcharge). There were a lot of other choices too, but that is what I can recall.  \n\nI grabbed a drink, a container of soy and lots of napkins (note: grab extra! Burritos are a little messy if you are like me and dip in soy).\n\nThe first bite was magical. It was super fresh, delicious, salty and crunchy all at once. Each subsequent bite just reinforced my joy. I polished it off and left very happy. I will definitely return soon. It is a little pricey, but I think that it is worth it. You have to try a sushi burrito if you are a sushi fan. You will love it!",

  "text": "The Cafe Beignet On Bourbon has some kind of live music playing most\nOf the day. \nYou can sit in the courtyard area or up in the balcony. There is also some covered seating areas. \n\nWhen you arrive you go to the register and order. They have 3 beignets for 3.99 and some other breakfast items and many choices for lunch. \n\nOnce you order and pay then you take a number and find a table. Once your order is ready they will locate you by the number. Remember to get your napkins before you sit so you don't have to leave your warm beignets to grab a napkin. YES you will need several. \n\nIf you enjoy the music remember to tip them. Usually there is a tip bucket out by the musicians. \n\nThere are two other Café Beignets nearby but Bourbon is my favorite because of the ongoing music.  The Royal street location also has Music but later in the afternoon. \n\n#lovejazzmusic",

  "text": "I travel for work, and spent a week here earlier this month.  It was such a great experience that when I returned to work in the area again this was the only hotel I considered staying in. Excellent location, wonderful staff, very nice breakfast and extras like social mixers in the evening with appetizers and snacks. And my room was absolutely perfect!\n \nThe kitchen was well-equipped, and had a full size refrigerator which was perfect for storing the food and drinks that I needed for the week.   I like to cook in my room so that i don't have to eat out all the time. All the cooking equipment I needed was there, silverware, and a complete set of dishes.  Even a dishwasher!\n\nThe sitting area was comfortable, and I appreciated that I could swivel the tv so that it could be seen from either the bed or sitting area. Workspace was excellent, and I LOVED actually having enough electric outlets to plug in my phone, laptop, ipad, and camera all at the same time. The outlets were conveniently located within easy reach so that I didn't have to crawl on the floor to plug things in.  Often when I travel I have to unplug a light or alarm clock and crawl behind the bed to find an outlet.  Not the case here! \n\nThe bed was super comfortable, and the lighting on both sides of the bed was very nice. The lighting in the entire suite was perfect: lights in in kitchen, desk area, sitting area, reading lights near the bed.  The bathroom was very nice and the shower was super!! Probably the best shower I have ever had in any hotel, even hotels with a much higher price point. \n\nI also liked the large windows that let in natural light. The windows open too, so you can experience some fresh air if you like.\n\nThe breakfast was very nice, really good scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, baked items, Greek yogurt, and many other offerings. I was able to make a great breakfast burrito with tortilla, eggs, cheese, salsa and hot sauce.\n\nThe evening social mixers offered appetizers, snacks, beverages, and sandwiches, plus there is a bar.  The seating area is plentiful with tables of different sizes and some community type seating.  Very comfortable and a good excuse to get out of the room and away from working at night.\n\nBreakfast staff and housekeeping staff are excellent!",

  "text": "This is our new favorite grocery store. The prices are decent, and the selection is absolutely insane -- especially where it counts, which, for me, is the produce section. It's annoying as hell for me to drive all the way through West Philly from the Spring Garden District, but it's worth it, since I can't find what I need, affordably, anywhere else closer. I also love the fact that they discount your gas if you have a club card, and once you build up enough points, you can get a ton of money off per gallon. Their gas prices seem to be cheaper than elsewhere anyway, so you can't lose!",

  "text": "This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Indy. It is one of a handful on Lafayette Road, but this is the best in my opinion. \nPlease do not go here and get Chinese food, it is good, but you can pretty much get the same thing anywhere else. Most of the Vietnamese food that I have had is very good. \nMy favorite is the spicy beef noodle soup called Bom Bu Hue. All of the fish dishes are tremendous too, very flavorful. Get the shrimp rolls as an appetizer you will not be disappointed. The Pho, which is the traditional vietnamese dish, is good, but I have had better but it is definitely worth a try.\nIt is a small cozy little restaurant with usually just one server, but works hard and is very friendly.\nSo go try something new, you will love it.",

I think the preparation of this dish by many other places in Delaware is a bit mediocre - usually too dry. I loved the flavor and texture of the dish from this place. The samosa chaat was filling and flavorful. Highly recommended!",

We had a quick check in as I had already done it on the app and we were placed on the SPG member floor which was very quiet and I loved the fact the ice machine was located one floor below. The room was spacious and clean with a jacuzzi tub we didn't use based on all of our travels visiting family and friends. The bed was very soft but supporting, the only down side was only 4 pillows for two of us. One down side was no hairdryer for her. The television gets directv which is a plus because that is what I have but also a down side because I can't watch the Phillies. Our room was refreshed to perfect condition upon our return Saturday. I would definitely stay here again it's quiet and comfortable. I'll try the restaurant next time also",

  "text": "What a wonderful novel addition to the crowded Philly sandwich scene!  Nick Filet on Lancaster Avenue in Paoli serves up genuine Filet Mignon sandwiches - yeah you read that right - Filet Mignon sandwiches!  These tasty creations can also have many toppings and I chose crumbled bleu cheese, cooked onions mushrooms & peppers, and the Nick Filet Sauce. The Nick Filet Sauce is a flavorful mixture of Worcestershire, mustard, and mayo.  And amazingly all this came in under ten dollars!  \n\nNow for a side note - Everyone knows Philly's beloved Super Bowl winning quarterback Nick Foles so I had to go here before the big Eagles playoff game this Sunday versus the Saints. Well of course there's the Nick sandwich, then there's the Big Nick sandwich, and finally there is the gigantic Mount Saint Nick.  (If you eat the latter, you'll be on their Wall of Fame!)  Well all these names were devised without thinking of Nick Foles but it's an amazing coincidence - no? \n\nAnyway, Nick Filet is worthy of a destination to Paoli ... and maybe even St. Nick Foles will eat here sometime!",

  "text": "Okay, so we all know this is my go-to restaurant for any meal of the day. If I can't come up with somewhere new, I go here. The food is always the best. Simple, hearty, tasty, hot, and ready for me to eat. Also, generous. So I am making this a four star update because I love it so, but I received some NO STAR service recently. For the first time ever!\n\nI was made to feel like I was a pest - you know the feeling. OKAY - I am a customer in a nearly empty restaurant! At the end of this transaction, a tip will be left that will comprise a fraction of your pay! Alienating me is not doing anyone any favors! I just put in an 8+ hour day at my job, now you are at your job. This is the way of the world. It's fair to dislike your job, or to be tired, bored, or just in a bad mood, but it's unprofessional to take it out on an unassuming customer.\n\nMy final request was for little cups with lids to go with my to-go box (gotta get that gravy to-go). Last time I ate here, the server was super friendly and basically made it rain little cups before I could even ask for one.  I didn't think my request for a little cup this time was going to be a problem. So I asked for one and I was met with total blankness. No verbal response whatsoever, just a look that I read as \"GFY\". I got my cups, I felt like ass about asking in the first place. \n\nIn the end, Mike tipped generously, per usual, but only because it's Honey's. You can't tip bad here on principle alone.",

It's casual with plenty of seating and you can order at a kiosk, which is much appreciated.\n\nI did a quick scan of the reviews to know not to order the pho. I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli bowl (bun thit nuong with cha gio), my sister had the Vietnamese hoagie (banh mi thit nuong), and my brother-in-law ordered the broken rice (com tam) with a cha gio side. Everything was excellent. The pork was super flavorful and there were tons of fresh vegetables and herbs in my bun. My sister said the bread on her banh mi was great. And my BIL loved his perfectly cooked and delicious com tam. We all appreciated the crispness of the cha gio. Even my baby niece enjoyed the vegetables we gave her. I love that they have a house-made fish sauce, which add depth to everything.\n\nI'd stop here again if craving Vietnamese in Center City.",

  "text": "Never realized that this place existed until I got on Yelp to find a place for a meetup for a friend in the city, but man is this place as good as it gets! Come here for the chaats ... they are beyond delicious. Love how the owner asks for your preferences before making it (attentive much?). In general, the chaats are blended together wonderfully. Never had I had so many flavors going through my mouth at once ... savory of the carbs, tangy of the fruit/mango, sweet of some Pakistani ethnic fruit, etc. etc. In short, it resulted in one very happy mouth at the end of the day.\nYou can't go wrong with the lassis either, though I would go for the mango one. Light on sugar and definitely light on the conscience vs. frozen yogurt or ice cream (in terms of calories).\nHowever, I think the one thing that really impressed me was the customer service ... he won't let me pay him unless I found the food satisfying. Not only that ... he also ended up giving us two desserts (rice pudding and carrot something) for free and refused to let us pay for them. Both of the desserts were delicious ... rice pudding was perfect as the rice helped to moderate the sugar content of the dessert and as for the other, I found the carrot dessert excessively sweet even for a sweet tooth like me. Nonetheless, I will definitely return down the line.",

  "text": "Their staple-donuts are absolutely delicious. It's hard to not love a donut covered in bacon. Or in salted caramel. Or a blueberry cheesecake donut. \nBoth the conception of the more strange flavored donuts as well as the integrity of all of their offerings are clearly of great quality. I think that if you line up a glazed donut from strange, and one from a chain grocery store side by side, there is an obvious difference in which one tastes better. \nThat being said, you have to expect to pay a little more for the donuts from strange. It's like opting for craft beer over domestic. Or artisanal cheese over kraft singles. You pay for the quality.  I don't find myself eating donuts that often, but if everytime i were in the mood for one Strange Donuts was my go-to shop? I would be very content with that.",

  "text": "Sushi Wasabi is a little gem in a stripmall near Southgate Mall (behind the Petro-Canada). It's quite small and busy all the time - reservations definitely recommended. \n\nWe only sampled sashimi and maki. Their menu is very traditional, which is nice - don't expect any of those weird cream cheese rolls. The rice in the maki is perfect - lovely grains that are not mushy, and stick together nicely. My favourites are the spicy tuna, spicy octopus, tuna with green onion, and unagi. Simple, and showcases the quality of ingredients. Strangely, they don't have any spicy salmon or regular salmon rolls? However they do have salmon sashimi which is just phenomenal - they use high quality fish that is very fresh and actually tastes the way it should (in contrast to some places where the fish looks good but tastes like nothing). You can also order sashimi by the piece - basically anything they offer as nigiri, you can also get as sashimi. The one nigiri I did order was chop chop - I love the scallop - this one had roe mixed into the mayo which was neat. Unfortunately I found that there was too much mayo - too saucy for my liking.\n\nFor takeout, you have to order from their little paper menu (see Kris B.'s photos). I didn't compare it to their regular menu but I am pretty sure it is pared down. They have take-out specials that are mostly nigiri/simple maki combos (substitutions accepted for a fee).\n\nIt's not cheap, but I'd definitely come back to try some other items like black cod (and eat more sashimi). I would be here all the time if it was closer to me!\nNote: don't expect great things for white wine - they only had two options but were out of the better one. Better to stick with beer :)",

  "text": "Lord, this review is overdue - this is what happens when you plan your own wedding :( Anyway, thankfully I always take notes (dork), so despite the fact that my review is from warmer times I can say that Kermit's Bakeshop produces tasty treats that are primarily fun, and all in a very surprising location on Washington Ave. I live about 15 minutes away and not long after they opened I walked over with the explicit purpose of picking up a bunch of goods for us to try together. The place is really just take-out, although there is a small bar on the side. The one staffer at the counter was super nice and patient, and amused when I told him our plan to 'taste test' their baked goods that evening. He answered the few questions I had as I went along both cases, and packaged up everything in boxes so that nothing would get accidentally destroyed. I lugged my big order back to our apartment and later on we all had fun taking bites and commenting on each:\n\nHamburglar (no longer on the menu?): a soft vanilla cake bun with sesame seeds, creamy \"patty\" that tasted like thick fudgy milk chocolate with chocolate sauce and coconut flakes \"lettuce\", and raspberry sauce \"ketchup\" - its like getting a vanilla cupcake with chocolate fudge frosting,  sweetened coconut flakes and a raspberry jelly filling. Mostly just fun, but pretty tasty too.\nBallpark Frank (not sure if also still available): my husband's favorite treat, its a red velvet hotdog with I believe a white chocolate cream, pistachio \"relish\" all in a choux pastry bun. The pink frosting was off putting at first, but the first bite revealed the yummy, sweet flavors for a slight variation on the classic red velvet cake\nBanana Bread: this slice of quick bread was solid overall - moist, not too dense, a good banana flavor, and a sweet basic icing glaze on top with chopped walnuts\nChocolate chip cookie: large chunks of semisweet chocolate in a shortbread like cookie base, this cookie was kind of dry and compact, not a hit with anyone\nOreo Marshmallow: this was a damn fine glob of homemade fluff about the size of my palm - it was a special treat that day\nKermit Hole: this cookie was simple and therefore perfect - thin shortbread cookies sandwiched a thin nutella layer with a cocoa-sugar dusting. The light nutella flavor with the buttery shortbread was the perfect amount for balanced flavors\nPistachio tea cake: Delicious! Moist and sweet, though the pistachio flavor was subtle, with the top crust dusted with confectioner's sugar\nFinger 32 (again, no longer on the menu): this pastry was a roll with sweet, thin, moist cake layers with a cream filling, white chocolate ganache frosting, mini marshmallows and gold painted walnut pieces, and a thin shortbread-biscuit vanilla cookie bottom. The guy had said the words 'sweet potato,' which may have been in the filling. This was my favorite, and very pretty\nSmores: their version was rectangular with a thin marshmallow bottom dipped in chocolate with graham cracker crumbs dusted on top, and a graham cracker piece stabbing center. Good, but truth be told, homemade smores are the best \nChocolate Marshmallow Pop Tart: chocolate filling inside a flaky pop tart pastry dough and a basic chocolate icing glaze topped with a cookie crumble and mini marshmallows that were lightly torched. It was good not great, but if you like pop tarts then this is probably your type of treat - I actually didn't grow up with pop tarts, freak that I am\nHippie dippie whoo-pie: I wanted to like this, but it needed improvement. The cake was thin but dense, and moist like pound cake. The cream filling was a sweet cream with fruity pebbles within it. \nThere's something about the fruity pebbles flavor, and I realized that you have to love the cereal to like this whoopie pie. \n\nAll in all, it was a super fun, sugar-filled evening that we all greatly enjoyed. I would go back, and actually would like to try their savory items, but it's kind of out of my way to get to...and one reason why I haven't had a chance to go back. Once I get a free day on the weekend, though, all bets are off - or perhaps I should get delivery since they oh so conveniently offer it...",

  "text": "I recently found myself in downtown St. Pete with a friend looking for some place to get a drink and food. I pulled up yelp and found this place. The reviews look good so we decided to try it. It was Thursday night around 9:00pm and a slightly chilly night so plenty of empty tables outside so figured we would have no wait. The hostess told us that they had calls out to other customers waiting for those tables and had to give them 15 minutes to show up. The thing is those customers put their names in an hour ago, don't think they are coming. So it was very frustrating we had to stand around waiting for 15 minutes when there were 5+ empty tables. This place would of been 4 stars otherwise. \n\nNow onto the drinks and food. We were trying to decide between two bottles of wine and the waitress kindly brought us out a taste of both. We went with Domain Gayda- 'Flying Solo' Grenache Blanc-Viognier and it was pretty reasonable in price at $36 for the bottle. \n\nThen we decided to share a few appetizers. We got the BRIE & CONFIT CROQUETTES, LOCAL SQUASH BRUSCHETTA and CRISPY PUMPKIN GNOCCHI. The LOVED the gnocchi. You could tell it was made fresh and the flavor was delicious. The Leek Hay on the bruschetta was different but tasty. The croquettes were good, though I think if the cheese was on the inside instead of on top it might of been better. \n\nAnd dessert was the real star of the night! We shared the chocolate tart. Our slice had to be at least 6 inches tall! And it had house made brittle on top. It was simply amazing!",

  "text": "Get the ice cream!!! True this is a pizza shoppe, but don't forget the ice cream!!\n\nI had the Chopped Salad (frisee, onions, green beans, and chickpeas), and loved it. I love all the textures of the salad, the dressing wasn't overpowering, and the ingredients were fresh. We tried the Melanzana Pizza (with eggplant!) and the classic Margherita. Both were done well, and I especially enjoyed the Melanzana. The pizzas were delicious, light and fluffy.\n\nLittle did I know that Pizzeria Vetri has an awesome custard machine. The Soft Serve Ice Cream was probably the highlight of the meal- awesome creaminess and flavor. Leave room for dessert!",

Danielle is great at attention to detail and I didn't even have a wait time. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she delivered. I will definitely be back. The place was clean and they take their time and do it right. Also Lani did my pedicure and it was so relaxing. She also did my eyebrows which came out very nice. See you soon!",

  "text": "Baseline: Reviewed during 2013 summer Devour Downtown \n\nWho: Me, my wife, our neighbors (married couple) \n\nDevour Menu: Craft cocktail + 3 courses for $25/person\n\nFood ordered & Food Review: \n-Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Salad: very testy and easily can be shared\n-Trio of Hummus: each hummus had its own flavor and texture. The traditional was good. The red pepper was very salty, which I prefer, but be warned. The edamame was weird, but then again that isn't really hummus. This could also easily be shared as an appetizer. \n\nI forgot to take photos of the apps, but the pita comes out in a small fryer basket, which is a fun presentation. \n\nSecond Course & Food Review:\nThe portions are extremely small, as in Tapas size. They do not come with a side, and Plat doesn't offer any sides. \n-Pork Belly Slider: 2 small sliders, but the flavor was good and the combination of toppings worked well. \n-Artisanal Grilled Cheese: I don't care for cheese that much, or at least I don't love it like most people. But, I really don't care for pork belly or duck pate. so I ordered the grilled cheese. It was delicious and gourmet. Highly recommended. \n\nThird Course & Food Review:\n-Milk and Cookies: this isn't really milk and cookies. like, at all. they soak fresh chocolate chip cookies in cream, strain it, then use the cream to make a panna cotta. Cookies and milk, no. Delicious, yes. \n\nCraft Cocktails ordered & Review:\n-A Grassy Knoll (lemongrass-infused indiana vodka, cocchi americano, zoning prosecco, cucumber, celery shrub, house orgeat): this was OK. it was extremely strong, but it normally cost $13 and you get maybe 5 oz of cocktail once you remove the giant ice cube. But, they do make the vodka in house at Plat 99, so they get bonus points for that. \n\n-A Sticky Situation (bone snapper rye, clement creole shrub, shagbark hickory syrup, peaches, lemon, hickory foam, bacon): yes, this drink has a piece of bacon in it. You must like whipped egg whites to enjoy this drink, as that is basically what the foam is. \n\n-Fog Cutter (oronoco rum, le reviseur v.s. cognac, prohibition indiana gin, orange, lemon, house orgeat, cherry-infused pisco): basically this is a fresh, extremely sweet long island iced tea. My wife loves long island iced teas, but she just though this was OK. \n\nI love that they don't rush you. Not at all. We sat at the restaurant for at least 90 minutes, and the courses were ordered individually and spaced out, not rushed. However, we also did NOT receive the popcorn that several reviews talk about, even though I saw several other tables enjoying a bag. I'm sad about the popcorn, but combining that factor with our \"no rush\" service makes me question if we just had a slow/bad waitress. \n\nI would go back, but I would probably sit on the patio/deck which overlooks south street and enjoy an appetizer and a craft beer (of which they have plenty on tap for $5.50 a pint). Maybe I'm not into the new mixology hipster trend, but give me a beer over a gourmet cocktail any day.",

  "text": "First night in Nashville my friend and I were looking for a dinner restaurant  that was close to the hotel we were at and fancy-ish as we wanted to be able to get a bottle of wine to celebrate our reunion.  \nwe yelped amerigo and based on the reviews and the price listings we thought this would be able to work.  granted, when Kyle told me about it i really thought we were going to some sort of \"American Style\" food place instead of an italian joint. Granted, to me this is american style italian, but they did a decent job.  i still need to teach kyle how to actually use this site though... burgers do not compare to tortellini.\nwe walked in without a reservation and only had to wait 10 minutes to get seated. however, there was a group in front of us that i got the impression had been waiting for quite a bit when one of the guys leaned over to the waitress and asked her if \"this is the kind of place you need to make a reservation to get into\", i guess he felt a little out of place in his jeans and button up shirt, which he shouldn't.  to me, in my obvious nola bias, this was a place one could get away with jeans, nice shirt, and/or a comfy dress/ skirt. lord knows kyle and i weren't wearing anything special... i did see some full on seriously dressy clothing though, super short satin skirts and sports jackets and the like. i wold define it more as dressy casual than dressy.  the decor was like an upscale applebees to me, but a bit more intimate.\nthe wait staff were all very nice, i think they were a little surprised by how much fun kyle and i were having together. this place is obviously a date night place and that we were laughing and not flirting and interested more in jabbering at one another, even inviting them into our conversation seemed to throw them off a little.  also that we weren't extremely picky over every little thing seemed surprising, but they did their jobs and they did them well and they even cracked a more than polite smile at several of our comments.\nas for the food and wine.... well, we paid $36 for a bottle of \"Woop, Woop\" wine that we found in the wine store the next day for $14, but we knew we would be overpaying, this was, after all a restaurant, with the atmosphere of ... well... you'll pay out the nose for the soft lighting and bench seating. the food was pretty decent, the cheese fritters were tasty, basically just a round friend cheese stick, but def had more flavor than that. i was totally down with the red sauce they served with it, but the other half of the sauce on the plate was a honey mustard concoction that just didn't hit my pallet right. we then ordered the spring salad, which was decent, the lettuce was fresh and the housemaid vinagrette was pretty tasty, it's a recipe i would be happy to get my hands on. They did do one of my favorite things on the planet which was to bring us out a plate of cibatta bread with the olive oil and vinegar and spices, i'm old school italian man, that just speaks to my heart.... so i instantly started to commit carbocide as soon as that was out on the table. as for our entress....i was a little too toasty from the wine at that point to remember exactly but i think kyle got the chicken margaritte (mostly because he was afraid to mispronounce anything else... the man can click away in senagalese but he was too freaked out to try to pronounce italian... tsk tsk) which he seemed to enjoy, there were no complaints, but he couldn't finish it all and mostly just left the pasta at the end. i had the tortellini with spinach and crab and white sauce.  i really have to admit to being disappointed by the lack of spinach, but i am a spinach lover and i guess when you're catering to a large clientel like that you don't necessarily want to throw more than a few springs in there....maybe.....  however, there was a TON of crab meat on the plate and the portion size was huge. sauce was tasty, nothing that i can absolutely rave about, but it was good. i didn't actually end up finishing anywhere near half the plate from everything else i had ordered, and ended up accidentally leaving the boxes at the table in our determined search for wine, so i didn't even get to give it the cold tortellini test (which i always do because yes... i am that person that likes leftover cold tortellini... and pizza... and sushi).\nprices varied from a  reasonable $14.00 for my entree to a whopping $32 for the filet (which is what i pay for a filet in nola in an EXPENSIVE restaurant).  i didn't look at the bar menu, but the cheapest bottle of wine started at over $25 and house wine is only sold by the glass.  we didn't get desert either just because of how stuffed we were.  so plenty of food for the price in what we ordered.\noverall i give this place a decent night out.  it wasn't spectacular, but i am food spoiled so it takes a lot to impress me, but it was in NO way as bad as i thought it might be on our first walk in the door.  its worth a try if you're ever near by.",

  "text": "I really wanted to give this restaurant 2.5 stars because half of everything was good.  We came for the Christmas Day buffet.  First, our service was outstanding.  I believe our servers name was Josh and he was very attentive.  The Christmas buffet was a little smaller than I expected but they did have a hot pasta station which was a plus.  Our reservations were at 1:30 and it wasn't busy when we got started.  But by the time I went back for my second plate the line was very long, the staff was trying to change out trays of food and it seemed hectic and mismanaged.  The food was mixed, for me.  Some of it I loved and some of it I didn't like at all.  Tops on my did not like list were the banana rum sweet potato mash.  I loved the sound of it but it sounded better than it tasted.  The antipasto salad was amazing and delicious, as was the tropical fruit salad.  I discovered a new favorite fruit, there was a white fruit with black seeds that tasted like a combination of fig and watermelon to me.  I asked a server and he went back to the chef to find out what it was.  It was dragonfruit.  The roasted root vegetables were not to my liking either.  There were mixed reviews on the clam chowder at our table, it was a sweet chowder.  I liked it but others prefer their chowder spicier instead of sweet.  The ham was good and the chollah rolls too.  Overall it was an interesting meal.  We had plenty to talk about discussing the food while we were eating, and since we are foodies that adds to our enjoyment.  I would not drive back from Tampa to Port Richey to eat here again but if I was in the neighborhood I would give it another try.",

  "text": "Sabrina's Café is awesome!  I love to come here for any meal.  No matter what you always get a fantastic meal!  \n\nMostly, I come for breakfast/brunch!\n\nHuevo's Rancheros is one of my favorite dishes and is usually my go to when I am here for a breakfast item.  I also like the barking Chihuahua when I am feeling very hungry!  Their frittatas are also excellent.  My favorite is the egg white turkey bacon frittata.  Its is a good option if you want a bit of a healthier type breakfast, with no loss of flavor! \n\nI like to come here with my sister and young nephew.  The place isn't bad for kids.  My nephew loves the pancakes and French toast. (He also loves their French fries!)\n\nTheir fruit is always super fresh too, which I love.\n\nFor lunch, I like to get either the Mel's Chicken cutlet (so drool worthy), the Tuscan chicken sandwich, or the Mediterranean wrap.  Everything is different and so flavorful.  Portions are pretty big, so whenever I come with my mom, we often share!\n\nTheir salads are also excellent.  Very often I will split a salad and sandwich with someone I am with, you cannot go wrong with any of the salads here.\n\nThey do themed brunches too, which is such a great novelty!  Special menu's are available for these with cute puns as all of the menu item names.\n\nThey don't serve dinner at all of their locations, but I highly suggest checking the places that do serve dinner out.  Fantastic meal!  Our go-to's are the octopus and calamari as a starter.  Always a good pick!  If we want something a bit lighter, we go for the hummus.\n\nThe dishes I have had as my main course are the Grilled Orange Ginger Pork Chop, The Honey Melon Glazed Salmon, and the Smokey Cajun Spiced Ahi Tuna.  You cannot go wrong with either.  Portions are also pretty big, so make sure you are hungry!!\n\n\nI also really like that this restaurant has plenty of vegentarian and vegan options.   I myself am a carnivore, but I do also enjoy the vegetarian options and have many vegan/vegetarian friends.   It is really nice to have plenty of choices and a variety in the menu which Sabrin'a certainly provides.\n\nThe prices here are pretty reasonable.  The only downside here, is the wait, especially on the weekends. Plus they can get crazy crowded and the space is pretty tight and can get pretty loud. However, I guess that is part of what makes Sabrina's so special.  Also, not a bad place for kids!Certainly worth a wait for the food, staff is always friendly and accommodating!  Great for smaller groups, but since space is on the tighter side, I wouldn't go in a group larger than 6.\n\nSabrina's is a great, casual, fun place to eat, I suggest you go and enjoy!",

  "text": "I absolutely LOVE the Melting Pot.  As others mention, it is an EXPERIENCE -- the way Fondu should be! -- and that's perhaps my favorite part.  You can easily spend 3-4 hours here enjoying your food and the company you bring, so I definitely suggest going with a group of 4, asking for a table with two pots, and having that be your night.\n\nTheir DRINKS are outstanding!  Love their mango margarita, dragon berry mojito, and blackberry sage lemonade.  They were all excellent, strong enough to warrant $8-9, and tasted fresh and fruity.\n\nWe always do the \"BIG NIGHT OUT\" -- $88/couple for a cheese appetizer pot (we love the Wisconsin 3 cheese and Feng Shui), salad, dinner plate with either oil or broth (both are excellent) to cook the meat, and a dessert pot (LOVE the white chocolate, s'more, and the bananas foster!).  When you go as a group of four (two couples) with 2 pots, you get to try two of everything and that's seriously the best.\n\nIt's a TON of food, so BE HUNGRY!!!   We make it a 5pm dinner that counts as lunch, dinner, and dessert.\n\nAMBIANCE is pretty standard but there's nothing wrong with it -- semi-romantic, clean, and the booths feel pretty private which is a plus.  The bathrooms are very clean and they have awesome disposable hand towels to dry your hands.\n\nI know people say it depends on the server you get, but the two times I've been, I had FANTASTIC SERVICE.  Last Saturday it was Brian, and he was awesome -- laid back, punny (not a typo), and very knowledgable of the menu.  He made great recommendations and made sure we knew exactly how to cook our items to our liking.  We never had to ask for more water or dipping sauce because he was there with more as soon as we needed it.\n\nThe manager and the owner both came by to ensure we were having a good night, and that always adds to the experience for me.  Even the bus boy was hilarious and very friendly.  Honestly, to me that's great service!\n\nWhy 4 stars?  Their salads need a little work and it is probably a little more pricey than it needs to be.  If it was slightly less expensive, I may end up here for fun instead of only for special occasions.\n\nRegardless, if you go hungry and are the kind of person who likes to enjoy your food and has a few good friends that are great company, it's worth it!  Remember -- you're paying for the experience and service in addition to the food.\n\nIf you're less hungry, maybe just get a cheese pot and a chocolate.  You'll spend less money, but still get to enjoy the deliciousness that is The Melting Pot!\n\nHappy dipping. :]",

We ordered a side of the cilantro rice as it was raved about - all true excellent combo of flavors. My husband opted for the steak and chicken with rice and finished it off with a smile. I ordered a salad with chopped chicken and it was awesome - they have several different sauces and I opted for the sauce vs regular salad dressing.

  "text": "I have a love hate relationship with new restaurants , I always set the bar too high and sometimes the newness is great and other times not so much . Planned a lady date here last week with Becca S. I was super excited to try out yet another neighborhood pizza place so we met up here last Thursday during the rainstorm of 2014. \nThe restaurant itself is pretty small about 3 four tops and bar seating for around 5 people. This place is Byob and they accept cards which is a plus. We both agreed a salad with our pie would make for less guilt so we ordered the only option available which was romaine hearts, artichokes , sun dried tomatoes , pickled eggplant and provolone. We requested the cheese on the side and did the large original pie. \n\nThe salad was fresh and the vinaigrette had a nice balance of acid and salt. The pickled eggplant was something very different I didn't hate it but it wasn't something id order by itself.  \n\nOur pie took a while to bake it seemed like a lot of to go orders were coming in, but we received our pie around the same time as another patron who came in as a walk. his pie came out right behind ours and we order about 10 min before he got there. The pizza is not Santuccis or Nomad it's in it's own unique category. I wouldn't quite call it Sicilian as the crust on the bottom was super crispy and the top had some nice bubbles happening. \nThe pie itself was alright, it wasn't bad but it wasn't stellar. The sauce had a good balance of flavor I could actually taste the freshness of the tomatoes and herbs, there wasn't much cheese to be seen which was a little disappointing. I believe the chef owner was there the night we went and he brought out cheese and red pepper flakes which was nice. The large pie is a decent size and Becca and I barely made a dent each taking home at least 1.5 slices for lunch the next day. Left over pizza lunch is usually my favorite but I was reminded the next morning how little cheese there was and wound up eating just mostly crust. \n\nOur damage was minimum as the salad and pie rang in under 25.00. I think the price point of the pies is great for the neighborhood and some of the other menu options sound great so I would probably order something for takeout.\n\nThis place and Nomad are equal in distance to my apartment for now I can't say which place will reign supreme but I will say I prefer the type of service I received at square pie ( that's a direct dig at you Nomad) This made for a good lady dinner date for now it's a high 3 stars for square pie.",

Even if you are lactose intolerant, take some lactase and go for it!!! You only live once and you have to try this salty, crunchy, creamy, chewy, and gooey goodness! Get one per each person and don't forget the magic word Opa!!!!\n\nWhen I first came to this country, I wanted to try everything that I have never tried. One of those things was grilled cheese imagining exactly this! Then, the waitress served me a sandwich. I called waitress over to let her know that she had my order wrong saying I ordered grilled cheese not sandwich, she looked at me wide-eyed and said, \"That is grilled cheese!\" My English was not good enough to explain what I expected to see when I ordered grilled cheese. And, I am pretty sure that the waitress was just as shocked as I was by the situation we found ourselves in. So, glad that my American cheese dream finally came true here!!!!\n\nBaklava Martini: I am coming clean that I ordered this drink to be a great yelper. It is not everyday that you see Baklava Martini on the menu. There are not many things more disappointing than ordering a drink that you never tried before and realize that you did not like the drink and have to order what you know that you like. That is why I order a glass of red wine when I drink and I rarely order cocktail drinks. This is one of the very few times that I would order a cocktail drink. And, I had two! I ordered the first one for yelp and the second one for me. \nI am running out of space and time to write about the rest of the dish we ordered which was the salad without the lettuce, octopus (ordered it even after I watched my octopus friend and my companions although very nice gave me the looks that made me slightly guilty.) Scallops and 1 lb of shrimp.  All of them were excellent. I could be totally content with Opa cheese The whole one for myself, salad for two for myself, and two Baklava martini next time!!! \n\nYes, definitely coming back to eat here!!!",

  "text": "LOL, what's not to love about Good Time Charlies.  I have been a patron on & off for many years now & always seem to find a reason to return.\nThe clientele is as unique as the establishment itself. You will find all types of patrons from 3 piece suits to shorts and flip flops. People watching is a personal hobby of mine & this is another great place for me to partake in my hobby.\nYou can't really call GTC a dive, but it certainally is nothing to write home about, unless to tell your stories of adventures while there. It is like a \"B\" grade movie or a homemade potato vodka, even though they do have top shelf liquor available.\nI can honestly say 90 % of the times I have been there have been really good times, I guess that helps to explain why I keep returning. Usually there is just something in the air that becomes contagious.  A bowling teams victory, a job promotion, a divorce party... or just a good time not to work party.\nI love the different games & pool tables,  it adds to the charm of a decor that never seems to change. As usual, I normally end up sitting at the bar & chatting with the folks behind the bar, as well as around me. Both sides of the bar are usually fairly antimated.\nI have to admit, I am not a fan of karaoke & now they have it every night.  No.... stop the madness, every night is 6 too many! I quit smoking 3 years ago, so that is no longer a reason I like GTC. I really don't like leaving and smelling like a cigarette,  but all things in moderation.\nOverall they take their food pretty seriously. It is not just pub grub, but you can get specials and entire meals. I am sure there is no chef back there, but who ever is cooking, usually does okay.\nYup GTC & I go way back & other than the karaoke,  I see no reason to mess with our relationship.\nWhat's a girl to do?  If it's not broken, don't fix it.",

  "text": "Looking for the best prices on wine and the best beer selection in Tampa?  Oh, here it is!  It took me way too long to find out about Total Wine after moving to Tampa.\n\nTheir wine selection is enormous and can be a bit overwhelming, but they have a fantastic staff.  They are always friendly and willing to help you find whatever you need.  Not only do they have a great variety of excellent wine, but I find myself searching for the cheaper bottles towards the bottom of the shelves and I can still find so many great choices.  \n\nNow for my favorite part....the craft beer section.  Holy. Crap.  I could spend hours in this area of the store.  I love beer and often can't find my favorite craft brews at most stores.  At Total Wine, I can't think of one beer that I have looked for and couldn't find.   Awesome variety and their prices are stellar.  Far better than any grocery store in the area (ahem, Publix).  Sometimes, I peruse the beer section at Whole Foods for some things to try and then go to Total Wine to find them at least a dollar or two cheaper.\n\nI don't drink liquor as much as I drink wine and beer, but their selection of liquor is no different than the rest of the store.  You can find anything you need and I've found the prices better here than any liquor store around here.\n\nTotal Wine is a one stop shop for all your alcoholic needs.  Trust me, you'll love it.",

  "text": "I give this place 5 stars because it's SO much better than 99% of Mexican restaurants in Tennessee. The food actually has flavor and tastes fresh. \n\nThe salsa clearly has real onion, cilantro and tomatoes; none of that canned stuff most places serve. Good start to things.\n\nThe top shelf margarita was fabulous. I frequently can't drink margaritas at restaurants because they overload them with sour mix. This margarita tasted like it had good quality tequila, and wasn't overly sweet or sour. \n\nI loved the chicken tortilla soup. The broth was delicious and wasn't greasy. The chicken was moist, and there were vegetables to balance out the taste. They had chunks of avocado, which I love. The portion was generous, I actually didn't finish it. \n\nMy husband had the tamales, and really enjoyed them. I was too focused on my food to try it. \n\nIf you live in the Bellevue area or west, this is a great option. The prices were great as well.",

  "text": "I was excited to try V street in the first few weeks of opening.  Although I'm not a vegan, I have really enjoyed Hip City Veg, Charlie was a Sinner, Vedge, and Blackbird.  Also, shout out to Blue Sage in the burbs, check it out if you get a chance.  Back to V Street... \n\nThe set up is interesting, I got there first so put my name in, and they took my cell phone number, so you can actually leave to grab a drink somewhere else if the bar is full.  Apparently the bar had a wait list as well which was confusing.  I tried to sit down when some people got up, but was told I couldn't.  I was not a fan of the beer and wine list.  When there's a wait list at the bar, and a wait for a table, it's tough to ask the bartender any questions, so some better descriptions would be appreciated.  I ordered the cider which was super sour.  I actually felt really bad because it was my mistake but I did send it back and switched to the Riesling which still seemed off, but I wasn't going to send another drink back.  My friend had a red but it was super chilled.  The fancy cocktails looked good and I'll definitely try one of those next time.  At the table I had the pumpkin beer which was also a little sour, but interesting.  I guess next time I need to google things before I order them.\n\nAs for the food, I loved the Langos, it's like a vegan gyro.  The crunchy papadums were light and airy, the jerk trumpet mushrooms tasted like BBQ, and the mushroom dan dan noodles were great.  We tried a few other things too, the only dish I wasn't a fan of was the carrot choripan.\n\nI'd probably go back for happy hour and get more of the Langos and the papadums.  Price was $50 each for a group of 5 who had several beers.  The staff was friendly, especially the hostess.  She checked in numerous times to update us on the wait.",

The inside isn't too grand for larger parties, but since we are still in a pandemic, I don't think I am too worried about larger parties. They do have some outdoor seating, which is nicer for the summer time. \n\nI was sitting inside near a window to people watch  and it was nice. The amount of food I ordered needed two tables though - I was hungry. The soup dumplings were filled with soup and that is always a good thing. The flavor of the soup dumplings paled in comparison with other places and the fried fish I just had. Really loves that fish that much. Honestly, I would probably come back just for the fish dish. \n\nI had a soup as well, but I could not remember much about that dish. \n\nThey accepted Venmo and cash, but not credit cards so that kind of took me by surprise. Luckily, I did have cash on me, but I generally don't carry cash. Just be cautious.",

  "text": "Urban Shabu is excellent. If you're a hot pot regular, you need to try this place.\n\nThe restaurant interior is clean and modern, with marble tabletops, contemporary plates and cutlery, new age chandeliers, and a \"Bon Appetit\" sign hovering over the sauces. The place is almost overrun with servers, who are ready to help you from the moment you enter the restaurant until you step outside the door.\n\nWe arrived around 7:15pm on a Thursday evening and were immediately seated. The restaurant, though fairly steady, wasn't nearly busy enough to be full. This is partly because the place is huge - similar to Kings - but also because weekend evenings are usually the most popular hot pot times.\n\nWe ordered our broth (HK Style Satay for myself; Tom Yum for Kylie) and a bottle of pinot noir (I love wine and hot pot). The servers checked on us a million times before we handed in our list of food items, but they weren't intrusive. They came by with an inquisitive look and could be sent off with a small shake of the head. At other restaurants, servers who come by too often can be annoying; at Urban Shabu, they're simply poised and ready to bring you what you need.\n\nOnce we got our food, though, they left us to it - hovering nearby just in case.\nA note on the broth, before I get to the food: the satay soup is lovely. If you're allergic to peanuts, you're out of luck - it's as good as my favourite coconut satay broth from Bangkok Restaurant. The tom yum soup has a little more of a tangy taste, but it's delicious, too. With items like these on the menu, why would you even consider ordering the (boring) chicken broth?\n\nWe ordered way too much food, as I'm wont to do at hot pot. Everything was fresh and of a great quality, and they definitely don't skimp on the servings!\n\nMy favourites generally include the angus beef, marble beef, lobster balls, and crab sticks. I'm not too adventurous when it comes to hot pot, simply because I know what I like. I tried a mash, which wasn't to my tastes, and I had a few mussels, which (in my opinion) taste better when steamed in a red wine sauce. The fish balls were the same as everywhere else and the shrimp balls pleasantly reminded me of xia jiao (a dim sum dumpling).\n\nOverall, I think I've found my new favourite hot pot joint. I still love Bangkok Restaurant's food and the owners there are lovely, but Urban Shabu has so much of the modern China feel and has many more items to choose from. Bangkok is a hidden gem; Urban Shabu is a well-known hotspot.\n\nAt $26 a person, it's pretty much the same price-wise as every other hot pot restaurant in the city. For two of us, with upgraded soup and a bottle of wine, it came to about $90. Not too shabby, Shabu. Not too shabby.",

I met a friend here for lunch and the food was deletable!!\n\nWe started with the spicy edamame which had a nice little kick to it. I LOVE that they have 3 options for the edamame (Salty, Spicy & Tart). Normally you only ever see the classic salty edamame but they are switching it up! We then had their East lunch special which included a roll, 2 pieces of nigiri and a small salad. I had a spicy tuna roll, the Escolar nigiri and the Chuka salad (seaweed). Delicious!!! I think this may be the first time I've ever had Escolar. I still need to go back to try their Special Sushi (habenero-magno salsa anyone?) and their street tacos, not to mention their yummy sounding cocktail menu.\n\nThe ONLY reason this is not a 5 star review was that our service was humerously awful. We got the wrong edamame to start, had to wait quite a while for our food even though it wasn't busy, and our waitress asked us for our order 15 minutes after we had already given it to her. Being new I'm hoping the service element improves but Umi Star's food is well worth it. \n\nI'll be back...and soon :)",

Their oysters are so fresh and they have the best texture. If someone has never eaten oysters before, I recommend trying them here so you'll be sure to have a good experience. Their raw oysters are amazing and their charbroiled oyster are even better! TRY THEIR OYSTERS!!!\n\nSome of their other dishes are just as amazing. They Lobster Marco is to die for! It's a whole lobster stuffed with angel hair pasta with shrimp for only $27. The gumbo is really good with lots of flavor. The spinach salad is good but doesn't really stand out to all their other amazing dishes. Their Spicy Andouille Ravioli was beyond good, I highly recommend this as an entree.\n\nAside from the food, the parking lot sucks when this place is crowded.

It was a surprisingly excellent burger. Very juicy and full of flavor. Service on this particular visit was extremely slow, and with all the televisions showing college football plus the music blaring, the place was pretty loud.\n\nMy second visit I met a friend for happy hour.  Much lower volume level this visit, and the server was much more efficient.  Great deals for happy hour - I went with the lemon drop martini, on special for $6.  All the appetizers are discounted for happy hour also, so my friend and I ordered a smorgasbord of items.  \n\nDuck wings are mentioned in every review, and they were great - nice and crispy, with a bit of a bite from the sauce. I also loved the drunken meatballs - they too were in a spicy sauce, and cooked perfectly. The big surprise of the night was the Kobe Brick Pizza - thin crust, loaded with wagyu beef, cheese, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, bacon and arugula, it had a fabulous flavor - I would definitely order this again. \n\nThe only appetizer I didn't love was their version of the Seven Layer Dip: white bean purée, harissa, yogurt, oven roasted tomatoes, smashed avocados, smoked cheddar & chopped olives served with grilled naan.  Even with all those ingredients, it just did not have much flavor.  It was still good, but not great.\n\nI will definitely be back to explore their drink and food menus further, and to take advantage of their excellent happy hour.",

Luckily, the atmosphere mimicked the experience and food and it was a lovely evening!\n\nWe tried the middle eastern sampler which was divine. Tasty hummus, some kind of couscous, and  roasted garlic. Yum!!\n\nI got the baby spinach salad which was wonderful. The sweet dressing and craisins complemented the pecans and goat cheese perfectly. It's easily my favorite salad anywhere because those flavors just work so well together! I sampled my husbands sweet potato fries and those were tasty as well. \n\nThe boys in the group enjoyed the beer, and overall it was very pleasant! A great addition to the Loop's already great food-lineup.",

  "text": "I'm beginning to think the problem might be me, because I've liked about 20% of the Asian restaurants I've tried in St. Louis. So, if you're unimpressed by blatant CA snobbery, skip my review. \nSpring rolls: best part of the meal, but still pretty standard fare. It's a fried spring roll, so don't expect any miracles.\nRoti: Fried dough can't really be screwed up too badly, but in my opinion it was a bit flaky and the peanut sauce wasn't great. I'd eat it again though.\nTom Yum: Hot sauce in a bowl with some undercooked mushrooms and questionable shrimp. It lacked the complexity of flavor that I love about traditional Tom Yum soup. However, the portion was generous, so if I would have liked the soup more I'd have been stoked.\nPad See Ew: Flavorless. Seriously. The broccoli was good though.\nService: Nice enough. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to you. There is indoor and outdoor seating, but I prefer being squeezed onto the sidewalk than sitting in their ambience-free space. I was seriously bummed after trying this place because it was supposed to be my little thai place down the street but nooooo it's just not really my taste at all. I didn't try their curries so I'd probably get that if I ever found myself back here for whatever reason, just because their noodles and soups were pretty blah.",

I think it's a fun \"supplemental gift option\" especially for your Philly friends who are leaving. If you're like me and you've come here for school, you've had a lot of good friends stay for a while and then up and leave me for residencies, fellowships, new jobs... So sad, but so nice to give them something to remember Philly by. I purchased this canvas where a local philly artist had painted different neighborhood logos-- like they had a Pennsport/Queen Village one that had Federal Donuts, Royal Tavern, Tatooed Mom's, etc... Very cute. They have lots of totes, philly-themed onesies, jewelry etc... A fun find!",

It's now an ongoing joke. \n\nThe food is almost always warm & cooked to our wants. There has been a few times, I ordered cheese whiz, I never got it with the order & they had charged me for it. I wasn't going to call and complain over a dollar but it's still frustrating but like I said it's only been a few times & there are times we order from them multiple times a week.\n\nI would recommend getting sauces on the side of your sandwiches or wraps, because sometimes it's a mess or way too much on it. \n\nI love that the drivers use square reader & you can just pay for it at your door when it gets delivered. \nThey do charge $1.50 for delivery. \n\nThey always have weekday specials, everyday specials & amazing lunch deals. And depending on how much you spend they will give you a free 2 litter of soda. \n\nIf you are looking for a new place to try this is it :)",

All were fantastic, but my favorite was definitely the Rasta roll. It was very unique and had great flavors! \n\nMy only complaint was the slow service we received. It took over 30 minutes to be served and I saw other tables that were sat after us getting their food before us. We came hungry, and didn't expect to wait that long for food at a sushi joint.

  "text": "what's a vegetarian doing giving a steakhouse a 4 star rating, you ask? well, while i will proudly admit that my brother is a server there, this review is not to praise his extensive knowledge of food & wine and dedication to fine service (ok, mini plug - ya caught me!)\n\ni'm not one to complain about lack of veg options at an establishment that features meat (in harry's case, they are known for their prime rib), i just choose to not eat there. however, because of my family connection, i have ended up dining at harry's on multiple occasions...and loved it every time! \n\non each visit i kindly alerted my server (when not my brother) to inform the chef that i was a vegetarian and to see what was available. let's not forget, quality chefs are masters of the culinary arts...and like any professional in the art world, doing the same thing all the time can get a bit tiresome. that said, instead of copping an attitude about this being a steakhouse, the chef, as i was told, was excited for the opportunity to \"be creative\" in the kitchen by making something off the menu. everything he has prepared for me used ingredients found in other dishes and was simply delicious!\n\nanother thing i love about harry's is their wine tasting flights. each month a different grape is featured, for example riesling or cabernet, and you are presented (quite nicely, i might add) with 2.5oz samples of this wine from 4 different vineyards, complete with printed descriptions of each. the price ranges depending on the particular wines being served, but in my experience, has always been under $15 - an excellent value, not to mention a great way to acquaint yourself with the subtle variations and discover the preference of your own palate.",

It may be my new favorite spot.\n\nI guess it's understandable why I haven't been here, as it isn't exactly close to major attractions. It's in an industrial, blue-collar area south of downtown near the river. Yet it feels like you've wandered into some lovely little Belgian farmhouse brewery when you arrive at the tap room.\n\nIt's not a big place, but it's a cool spot to hang out. It was a little too chilly for the patio outside, but I can't wait to come back and sit and sip there sometime (you can bring dogs, too).\n\nOnto the beer, which is the most important thing. This brewery specializes in saisons, Belgians, ciders and the like. I was told that the draft list was a little more boring than usual when I was there, but I still found it to be pretty amazing. I particularly enjoyed the Hommel, their well-known Belgian pale ale. You can get full pours or 5 oz tasters, the latter of which is very reasonably priced at $2-3 and allows you to try many different ones.\n\nI was there on a slow night, but the bartenders were extremely friendly. They even comped me a beer when they found out I was a beer nerd from out of town. Later, another bartender opened a bottle of the Foeder Saison and poured me a glass on the house. It was a spectacular saison, one of the best I've ever had. I ended up buying a bottle to take home. \n\nThere are also some small bites on the menu. I got the pretzels and beer mustard. Loved the tanginess of the mustard, and while the plate is meant for sharing, I devoured the whole thing myself.\n\nThere are some amazing things happening with small breweries in Anheuser-Busch's hometown, and Perennial is my new favorite one.",

  "text": "FUBLE Diaries: Episode 6 \nI try to put up a good front , but the fact is, I'm not very worldly. Strike that, Ive been around this globe, more true is that I'm not very Philadelphia-ly. I'm a huge sports fan, football being the best, but I have never tailgated and have never been to a regular season Eagles game. This would become evident to all before Sunday Game Time. \n\nI knew we needed an early start and after the Ruby Tuesday/Oasis 1-2 punch, I was surprised when the boys were ready to go at 7am. The first of many mistakes made was that we had forgotten to take the Moose meat, that the guys brought from Alaska, out of the freezer. We had to stop for some provisions anyway, so we just picked up some not-as-cool-as-moosemeat sausage to grill. \n\nWe made it to the Linc in good time and were not surprised to see the lot pretty full already, at 8am even though it was a damp day...this was the Eagles Giants game after all. Not that I would wish it on anyone but having Jason's handicap placard was a great experience in there. It opened alot of doors for us and got us a sweet spot within the shadow of the stadium. \n\nAs stated, this was my first tailgating experience, but not my first grilling experience, so there is really no excuse for the following screw-ups. I got the grill set up and went to light it with a brand new lighter. The piece of shit lighter didn't work at all! I could have farted on the charcoal with better results. Luckily, the Alaskans were good at making friends. Neighbors to both sides received authentic Alaskan beer (which they lugged all the way here on the plane...4 cases!) and we got our grill lit. \n\nAfter getting the meat on the grill , I realized I didn't bring any grilling utensils. Luckily hot dogs are easy to turn by hand. It was great eating hot sausages at 10am, amongst fellow sports fans, with the home of the Eagles in the background...even if we did forget to bring any condiments. \n\nFinally, I didn't have a viable plan to dispose of the spent charcoal and hot grill. We ended up using all of our bottled water to douse it and luckily it cooled off in time to pack it away before heading to the Stadium, but images of a burned out shell of a car (or cars!) plagued my mind for the rest of the day. You'd think all the snafus would have dampened the already drizzly day but we had a great time, in spite of the mistakes and agreed that we would be more prepared next time. \n\nOnce inside the complex, it was like a carnival. Radio shows broadcasting, bands playing, cheerleaders posing, vendors gouging...it was great. Our seats were in the nosebleeds but I can honestly say that there isn't a bad seat in the house. \n\nIve been a fan for quite some time but nothing compares to the goosebumps I received when the players were announced , to much music, fanfare and fireworks. I recommend all fans see their team at least once live and in person. \n\nThe Alaskans absolutely loved the Philly fans, not in spite of the bad rep but because of it. They revelled in the fact that they were allowed to be assholes. They loved taunting Giants fans with the \" Asshole!\" chant , a practice which continued long after we left the stadium. They got caught up in the Eagles Chants, the High 5's, getting rival fans kicked out. They even added a little of their own flavor with the Alaskan chant of , \" UP THE GUTS!\" every time the running back would find a big hole and it was a trip when our seat neighbors used the line as well. I was also partial to Dean's shout of, ' He's built like a kicker!\" , whenever a small or skinny guy would walk by. \n\nJason was still feeling a little under the weather and the damp day wasn't helping. He wrapped himself snugly in a newly purchased Eagles fleece and at one point, a fan walked past and just said, \" You comfortable sweetheart?\" The other 2 heard this and thought it was the funniest thing they'd ever heard. It solidified their love of the ugly Philly sports fan. \n\nIt helped considerably that the game itself was an Eagles rout of their division rival. We screamed ourselves hoarse at every play and had a grand time doing it. Towards the end, when others headed for their cars to get a jump on the traffic, we decided to stay in our seats for as long as we could, not wanting the experience to end. We knew it would be an ugly ride to our next destination as Game 4 of the World Series was set to be played in a few short hours, but we didn't care. This had been the whole reason for the trip and we wanted it to last. \n\nPlans were made on the spot to meet next year, possibly in another city giving some other of our fantasy football brothers a chance to attend. It was agreed that we would all bring a nice chunk of that Philly Fan Bravado, that made the day great. We finally left the stadium and made our way out of the complex. As the Linc got smaller in the rear view, we were reminded that while the reason for trip was over, there was still more adventure ahead...",

  "text": "What can I say, all you can eat buffet restaurants are really polarizing in general. Brazillian Steakhouses are no exception -- not everyone likes or wants all you can eat meat. I'm prone to overeating when given the chance, but when the quality of the food is THIS good, it's not often nearly as bad as it would be otherwise. Still, I much prefer coming to a place like this for lunch or brunch rather than dinner (fewer options means less likelihood of my overeating terribly badly). \n\nWe came here for New Year's Eve Brunch and it was most excellent. Previously I had only ever visited the downtown location of Pampa, but this one is new, and very brightly lit which is quite nice. I like how much space is available around the salad bar, and the food quality is quite excellent. The servers were really helpful as I was there with folks who had never been to this style of restaurant before. I find that the meat is very delicious on the whole, but there's always only a few cuts of meat that I absolutely adore while the others are just OK. It varies on the day. On our visit, I adored the soup (it was good!) the oils and the bread, the French toast, and the fruit and veggies (can't go far wrong with pineapple!).\n\nAs we had a late brunch reservation one person in my party was quite disappointed when a customer ahead of him in line took all of the watermelon before he was able to get any (and it wasn't refilled before we left :( ) but that's a pretty minor complaint when it comes to the whole grand scheme of things. I really wish that the delicious cheese buns were available at lunch or brunch as they are my favourite part of supper at Pampa in general! I guess I can't have everything. \n\nIn any case, I love this restaurant though I'm only likely to visit a couple of times a year. I'm quite happy that they do online reservations (and they confirm them frequently -- both on Open Table and via phone call). I was surprised at how many times my reservation was confirmed, especially given that I was traveling over the holidays and got the phone call to confirm my reservation while I was out of the country. Still it was helpful and they really do seem detail-oriented when it comes to customer service at this location!",

Surprisingly it was easy to get a group of tables for 10 people.  Quick order, and not a long wait for the food to come.  Surprisingly small pint of TruMoo chocolate milk.  Was expecting the real thing, real milk and that was the only disappointing part of the meal.  Beignets are the bomb and there is nowhere outside of Cafe Du Monde that knows how to make the properly.  Love, love, love coming down here for these crispy fried moist flavorful dough with powdered sugar.\n\nDon't miss this place or one of the other locations in town when you come to New Orleans!",

  "text": "Another quality location for this chain in the Tampa Bay Area that I first discovered in San Antonio, Texas almost two decades ago.\n\nThe vast selection of items speaks for itself and the spuds put them ahead of most other \"sandwich and more\" fast casual dining concepts.\n\nOver time, the spuds have become almost a must have on every visit because they are very filling and a great choice on the Choose 2 menu.\n\nTheir selection of soups also stands out to me over similar spots and I haven't found one yet that wasn't worth putting next to my spud of choice for that particular day.\n\nI will say that if you're in the mood for a sandwich, order it as a full size and not as a half or part of the Choose 2. Besides, you get a side item with the full size sandwich and the half is just not large enough on its own even with soup or salad in my opinion.\n\nAnother reason I like McAlister's is how the employees seem very relaxed and competent when taking orders, while also very open to questions and special requests. I've always liked the overall attitude and they don't sweat small details and seem to want to make people happy with their orders. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but I seem to rarely get the forced \"Suggestive Sales Tactics\" from cashiers at McAlister's. And if they do ask if I want a drink, it is like they're just making sure rather than really trying to sell it to run up my bill.\n\nOh, and about half of you hate pickles, so you can be gone now. For the rest of us, don't you love how McAlister's has a huge bucket of pickles cut into quarters that customers can just take as they wish? I find this at a number of various places in Texas (Such as Twisted Root), which brings me back to where I first went to a McAlister's in 1998. It was really good on that San Antonio trip and still is now as they've expanded into Florida.",

  "text": "One word - delicious.  We stopped in on a busy Saturday for a cheesesteak and a roast pork hoagie with sharp provolone and spinach.  The buns are fresh and substantial enough that they don't soak through and disintegrate.  The cheesesteak comes on a sesame seed roll which adds such a lovely flavor as the seeds are toasted.  The price is very decent, $8 for a foot-long, cash only.  They also have meatball, roast beef and chicken subs along with sides like kick-ass onion rings.\n\nThe service is incredibly friendly and although there isn't a lot of room inside where you're ordering and waiting, they keep it moving right along and there are tables outside (picnic) for eating, but not a lot of seating total.  Again, cash only so be prepared.  It's across the street from Super Fresh, Target, etc. so there's lots of parking.\n\nAs i basked in the glow of belly full of deliciousness, husband said - oh, we'll be back.  Definitely.",

Which is why I held off on writing this.  \n\nFor Pete's sake hire some servers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  15mins sitting outside on average before I'd have to go in and ask for a server.  Even though the server walked by me several times.   \n\nDrinks then take 15mins.\n\nFood comes out 50mins later...  Cold!!!  \n\nOverall it's an hour and a half for one drink and a cold sandwich.  \n\nYou leave frustrated and feeling completely unappreciated for spending your time and money.  \n\nPlease,  just hire some servers.  It's insane that every time I have been there it's one person working and tables are walking out in frustration. \n\nI really hope yall read this because I'd love to come back in and be proven wrong.",

  "text": "As a rule, I loathe chain eateries and especially those with order counters.  As exception, I love MOD which is a chain with that ordering set up.  As a rule, I dislike flash fired pizza joints that offer 'all the toppings you want' formats.  (I'm talkin' to you Blaze.)  As exception I love MOD which has this very format.\n\nI'm a MOD fan based on multiple good experiences with MOD outlet in Oregon and my first at this newly opened (roughly mid November) location near Boise Towne Square Mall reinforced why that is so.\n\nThat this MOD was \"lightly customered\" on a weekday at the height of lunch time suggests many mall and Nordstrom Rack shoppers may be unaware this is now open since both are nearby.  But it is.  So here you are.  Now you can go.\n\nTHE DRILL:  Menu for pizzas (salads too) is posted on the wall if you want to choose one of their recommended creations.  Or you can choose to create your own with any toppings in any amount as you talk to the nice people behind the service counter and they move you on down the line from crust type to sauce type to cheeses to toppers.  Pay at the end. Stand aside or take a seat.  They'll call your name at the pick up counter when your eats are ready. (You can also order online and pick up at this same counter.) Bus your own. \n\nEATS & PRICES:  Pizzas in small (feeds 1), MOD (11\" and for us easily feeds two) and a larger one.  Crust in standard thin, thick and I think they have a vegan or GF one too.  Price for MOD size with any toppings = only $7.97.  Top that for good deal!  On the topping topic, all of MOD's (unlike some competitors) are top shelf quality.  For what it is - this is a convenience food chain after all and not a hand thrown Neapolitan pizzeria - the crust is pretty darned good too.  \n\nDOES GOOD SERVICE MAKE FOOD TASTE BETTER?:  It seems the people who work at any MOD are friendly and efficient in moving through people in line, even those who are MOD newbies and need a little extra help for the first visit.  True here too. MOD was started by a former Starbuck's Exec and leverages what works well at that chain too for friendly people serving customers.  They're still working out new place wobbles here but headed in the right direction.\n\nLIBATIONS: Help yourself fountain drinks like real lemonade (Marionberry is a fav), iced tea (one with pear too), sodas in bottles, floats, draft beer and new learning for us today - MOD has milkshakes.  Not that I'd choose one with pizza, but maybe one day I'll order a salad with MOD-est calorie content and pair a shake with it.  No coffee service it seems.\n\nOTHER EXTRAS:  Another reason to love MOD is their No Name cakes.  These are, as you might guess for the way they are wrapped in silver foil, MOD's riff on the Hostess Ding Dong.  But in the case of the MOD, No Name it is a tender really good chocolate cake with luscious vanilla kissed cream filling and enrobed in chocolate ganache.  I know...I thought cake as dessert chaser to a pizza was an odd idea too.  But carried out to eat later with a steaming hot cup of coffee it is \"splendelicious\".  \n\nSPACE WITH LOTS OF SEATING & NOT TOO MUCH NOISE:  As a rule, I'm not such a fan of eating in MOD's spaces just for the noise level created by hard surfaces, high industrial ceilings and really loud, head banging music mixes.  But at this location the music was not turned up too much over the top and I got to listen to the likes of Eric Clapton and CSNY so what's not to love?  Lots of seating in 3 separate indoor areas and looks like outside set up for nice weather.  And a BIG woohoo that among the options of booths for 2 or 4 people, lots of tables with chairs or benches and maybe seating for 80 in total, only 8 of those seats were high chairs at high tables.  Very nice. They get it that standard height seating works for everyone.\n\nPARKING: Private lot but it was packed as there are several convenience food eateries in the complex.  Like a Zupa's next door.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Accessible (aka ADA) spaces in lot, level in the door and throughout the eatery, the cattle chute order line could be difficult for a wheelchair user but payment counter is at standard height, standard height seating tables.  Loos are accessible but the door opening weight far exceeds ADA and Idaho code maximums of 5lbf and so near impossible for mobility disabled person to open. Easy for management to adjust  - it should have been called out as violation by city of Boise building inspectors.\n\nPS:  There is another MOD that opened a month or so ago on Capitol Boulevard near Trader Joes.  I do not know if the two are franchised by the same entity or corporate owned.  MOD allows both as part of their business MOD-el. This small chain launched @ 2008 by a former Starbuck's exec ensures controlled expansion is quality centric by having stores either corporate owned or franchised to a select set of applicants with XX years of documented success in food service enterprises and $XXX,000 in cash on hand.",

We had a 30 min wait time on a Thursday evening. It wasn't a bad of a wait but reserve on Yelp in advance to save yourself some time!! You're welcome \n\nFor starters, we went with the pigtails and the crawfish hush puppies. The hush puppies were awesome and per my colleagues the pig tails, they were so good! Don't be afraid to try them. For main course, I went with the drunken angel dish because it is all over YELP.  This is everything you'd want in a dish from portion size to flavor to the saffron base to the garlic bread!! Phenomenal!\n\nThe service was good. The waitress tried and tried and I am know she did her best. She was responsible for an entire section and unfortunately that may have slowed her down. She did a fantastic job servicing us but I think the restaurant must have more than one person overlooking an #IronChefTucson Winner.\n\nI didn't love the fact that 70% of the menu is pork base. If you don't  eat pork, the food is already prepped with bacon / sausage and can't be removed. On the other hand, if you love pork this is your spot. \n\nFood 5/5\nService 4/5 \nRestaurant management 3/5\nMenu options 3/5\nAtmosphere 5/5",

The facility is amazing, pulling up you would think it was a world class art museum . We went expecting it to be packed, as it was a nice day and the weekend but it was perfect. Not packed, not deserted. We got in and out son went to the water attraction right away, started playing and didn't stop till we left.

Each different area had a theme, there was the water theme, jungle, construction, food store, space, cars, shoe store, etc.. We especially liked the hospital section because it was sponsored by CHOP and we are big fans of them. We ended the day by going on the carousel, which my son didn't love but that's more him than it.

The food was just OK. It meant a lot to me that it was fresh and cooked to order.\nThe clam chowder did not have a lot of flavor whatsoever. I had to add the crackers,salt, tobasco and luckily I carry my own little stash of cayenne pepper. I have had clam chowder all over the world and sadly, I cannot recommend this once. It needed some creaminess butt hat could be personal opinion. Get a cup if you are unsure like we did, a bowl of it is a big commitment. There were a lot of people working and things came out very quickly. \nHubby had a local beer which he enjoyed and I had a glass of wine. A glass of wine here means a GLASS, loved it. No frills here, wine right to the top of a glass you would get at your granny's house.\nWe split the fried platter with calamari, shrimp and scallops for $13. Not a ton of food  (3 pieces of each maybe) but the coleslaw complete with raisins and pineapple was a treat and they also throw on about 3 large onion rings. This was a nice dish to split so we did not ingest TOO much fried food. There is also the option to have fried oysters on it which we skipped. I imagine the more you order on the plate, the less you get of each.\nI would for sure come back here. Unpretentious and even a little gritty. Come as you are.\nIf you want fine dining, there are other options on the pier.\nThey will validate your parking if you park on the wharf.",

  "text": "To be honest, I was a little disappointed when I saw my reservation was at the Hyatt Regency Penn's Landing after going through Hotwire after reading previous Yelp reviews on the hotel. But I was pleasantly surprised on our weekend stay here. \n\nWe parked in the parking garage and it is a hike if you self park. Once you make it to the elevators, it is easy to get around. Mark (the SO) made friends with the concierge while I checked in. Check in went well. \n\nOur room was nice - 2 double beds on the 9th floor. It was clean, roomy  and I loved  the light over the bathtub. I can see some of the issues (hallway noises, dated decor, separate charges for services) that other Yelp reviews brought up, but none of what I saw would have bothered us.\n\nWe also grabbed a bite and drinks at the hotel restaurant/bar after coming in early for the evening. Typical high prices, but our bartender was great. Friendly and made great drinks.\n\nTake the time to talk the concierge!  They are a wealth of information about the hotel and the area. Chris made reservations for us at a very popular seafood restaurant and suggestions about what to do and see on our limited schedule. \n\nThe only down side (kind of) is that it is non smoking. So that forced the SO to run down to an open door every time he wanted a smoke. This gave him the chance to show the doorman that he wasn't a slob (1st trip - sweats and slippers, next time - jeans,  T Shirt and shoes, and final - business casual).",

  "text": "So we've only ordered to go meals from here. \nThe pulled pork is great and so are the BBQ sauces. It smells amazing. Nice and smokey. We've picked this up for dinner a couple nights. Plus my guy loves their sweet tea. \nThe sides haven't been that great though. We've tried mac n cheese, green beans, baked beans, and greens. Some were more tolerable than the others but nothing blew our socks off. \nStill. We'll continue to swing by for the great tasting pork and tea.",

  "text": "Currently enjoying a Sierra Nevada Torpedo at the bar. I love this place. Of all the spots on Main St, Le Bus really has a Manayunk decor. It pays homage to the crew races with the \"kayak\" right over the bar and also has some bike race art work. This place has a very clean, classy appeal but still feels casual. Although its not a bar, and their focus isn't on craft beer, their 6 rotating taps always have something I love. The Sunday brunch here is always a good bet, but I also enjoy coming here for dinner. The nachos here are really good if you're just looking for a tasty snack!",

  "text": "I am so happy that we decided to try Jessi's one morning. It is one of those family-owned restaurants with solid food that you always wish you could discover. I can't believe that I waited so long to try this Neighborhood gem! \n\nWe have visited twice now and ordered a Philly Cheesesteak, a French Dip, Potato Pancakes and the Albanian Salad. Everything has been delicious. The Au Jus for the French Dip had a ton of flavor. Even the coleslaw and fries served on the side were good. I really loved my Albanian Salad with gyro. It had thick chunks of vegetables and a ton of flavor. \n\nMy favorite thing however was the potato pancakes. I am slightly obsessed with potato pancakes and HAVE to order them when they are on the menu. Jessi's are very flavorful. They are slightly crispy on the outside, and moist and creamy on the inside. They are served with your choice of applesauce or sour cream. Definitely try them. \n\nOur second visit to Jessi's will definitely not be our last. I only wish that they were open later at night so we could eat there more frequently.",

My 4 year old devoured the white beans with rice. I'll be back tgi try more for sure. I love that they have a cafeteria style and you can choose 1-4 items and have a salad option too. Enough of this amazing review.... time for some coconut based,  dairy free ice cream  until next time....",

Family business which makes it even better. #supportlocal  Clean, cute restaurant, great for family's. I had the lasagna the first time I went & it was amazing. I could wait to go back to try the shrimp linguini fra diavolo. It did not disappoint, it was the best pasta I ever had.  The authenticity is what sets this restaurant far above others. I am so grateful I found this place. I definitely would recommend to others.",

  "text": "What a lovely little brewery in Dunedin! We stopped here with my in-laws for a late lunch and loved it. They are dog friendly, which was good because we had our 65lb puppy with us. \nI saw cheese curds on the menu and immediately had to order those since I've been wanting to know what those taste like. I loved them, but if you're from Wisconsin and don't absolutely love them here, please don't hold it against me. \nFor food, I had the pulled pork sandwich which was amazing. Husband had the pub burger, which I had to take a bite of (or three bites of) and it was delicious too! Highly recommend. \nThey have a wonderful selection of beers too. The apricot peach ale is my favorite. I'm looking forward to visiting my in-laws just so I can go back to this place.",

  "text": "Dear Eiffel Society, \n\nYou really need to make up your mind about what you are, because this multitasking thing isn't working out. (I know you are hip enough to have a subscription to the New York Times on your iPad; they had an excellent series last year about the dismal failure of multitasking in the human brain. I know you saw that. Don't pretend you didn't.) \n\nFirst off, you are a freaking eyesore. Yes, I know your pedigree. You were part of La Tour Eiffel...until your fat ass made her sag in dangerous ways. (True story.) Then no one wanted to take you home at the end of the night until some guys in New Orleans were drunk enough to make a bid. You came all the way to New Orleans, only to be duped because the original purchasers were out of cash. Knight in shining armor rescue to follow. It was the '90s; things were crazy. But you are an ugly building in the middle of a pretty part of town. And I have to look at you every day when I leave my own (quaint) apartment. I really wish you'd figure out how to actually capitalize on your curves and lines instead of spraying on tons of fake tan. That stuff isn't even skin deep, and that's how I feel about your marketing. \n\nNow, skating past the...striking...exterior, I have some bones to pick about your innards, too. First off, are you a restaurant or a dance club or a swingers joint or a bar? Because your kitchen is impressive, churning out dishes that rival anyone in town. Your cheese plate was excellent, and the inventive plating actually works for most of the dishes. But what is the use of having an excellent kitchen if your servers don't bother coming to work...often? I'm not the only person who noticed that you can't keep an employee, dear. The night I visited, our poor waiter apologized three times because he was the only server on a packed floor. (Although he did bribe a barback and bartender into helping him run food.) Understaffing is not flattering. Never will be. \n\nSo are you trying to copy 13 and MiMi's by being a bar with decent food? Because that, I can respect...except you didn't seem to know what wine you had in-house, either. When the wine list is as short as yours (10 choices: 4 red, 4 white, 2 sparkling), it can't be that hard to keep it under control. But darling, you were out of Riesling, the Grüner Veltliner was watery, and your Pinot gris was like licking a cork. Even though the heavens opened and angels flashed their classy little tatas when I tasted the Malbac, did we really have to go through all that for a little wine? The other problem with trying to be a bar is the table service thing. Namely, you have it. \n\nAlso, what is with this dance club notion? I went on a Wednesday night, because I burned dinner (again). Your salsa get-together was already in progress when I arrived, but the music was just so loud. I could hear it across the street, dear. Did you give your 14 year old brother control of the stereo knobs? I certainly could not hear my server or anyone else; we communicated by pointing at the menu...in the dark. Oh, it was effective: it succeeded in giving me a grand headache. So are you a club or a restaurant or a bar? \n\nIf I may: a back-handed compliment about your salsa night clientele. There were some beautiful dancers showing off amazing skill on your stage, but some of the dancers made me feel like I should pay to see the show. I really would have paid theater prices to see the young couple doing freeform salsa; their interplay was gracious and inspired. However, the woman who looked like she was undoing her partner's trousers with her hips on the dance floor in full view of the entire restaurant belonged on an entirely different sort of stage, where I would not pay the cover charge. (It really was too much when she inserted her hands in his pants. Darling, I wish you could have done something about that. Or is that the reputation you want...?) \n\nEiffel, dear, I don't even know what to wear when I come to your place. Should I pull out whisper-thin stilettos and cooch-baring lamé dresses or wear tip-to-toe furs to brave your frigid interior? Actually, the impression you give is that I'm just too fat to ever fit right in so I should give up and go home now. \n\nAs I write this, I find myself craving more of that lovely Malbac and another cheese plate; but I'm not sure I can brave the wilds of your identity crisis to procure them. \n\nMaybe this is the adolescence of your otherwise lovely life, you strange thing...\n\nsincerely, \n-Suzanne J. C. \n\nPS: Your accessibility is dismal. The elevator is hidden under the building and through a cluttered parking area. The restrooms are down some stairs and back somewhere. The restaurant is dark and loud all the time. There was no braille signage anywhere and no menu assistance, either. The tables are clustered too close for anyone with a mobility device to manage very well.",

I felt the urge to look around for a sign that stated we were obligated to have food in order to stay. Whatevs, we had a good time anyway. The space is efficient and they seated our group of 6 with a reasonable amount of wait time for dropping in on a Friday evening. Definitely a good spot to share a lovely evening with good company.",

  "text": "One of the few Chinese places that I would recommend to a friend visiting Philly. For some reason I haven't fallen in love with Philly Chinese food, but Han Dynasty makes the cut!\n\nLovee the dry pepper chicken!! The garlic lamb was also really good. Pork belly double cooked style was a little disappointing but we fixed the soggy texture on our pan at home. Veggie selections have been just ok as I've tried both the bok choy and the string beans which I prefer slightly over the boring bok choy. The Dan Dan noodles are pretty good too as the other reviews rave :) but I still prefer simple steamed rice a lot of the times to complement the super tastey entrees they have here.\n\nService is always very friendly! The food is prepared fast and tastes amazingly fresh all three times I've ordered takeout from here. Prices and portions aren't great as I'm used to the quaint authentic hole in the wall gems back home in California.",
