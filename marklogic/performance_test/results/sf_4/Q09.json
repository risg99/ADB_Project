  "text": "I actually had to come here twice in order to their delicious shrimp poboys. The first time was around 11:30pm on a Saturday night, but they had ran out of bread for the night. We decided to try again the next day for lunch and was able to order a shrimp poboy.\n\nIt took them about 20-30 minutes to make 10 orders of shrimp poboys, but that meant it was a perfect time to grab a frozen irish coffee from the bar. \n\nThe shrimp poboys reminded me of vietnamese sandwiches. Same type of bread with lots of veggies, but the key ingredient is the fresh shrimp. Every time I've had shrimp poboys, the shrimp has always been fried, but this time I was pleasantly surprised to see the shrimp without batter. \n\nThe sandwich was quite delicious although quite expensive at $14.",

(But that's another review.)\n\nThe burger itself was on the rare side - and I had the special with a fried egg (perfectly done - a bit runny but not raw) and cheddare cheese (subbed for swiss), lettuce tomato and scallion mayo.\n\nPerfection!   (And a calorie bomb.)\n\nCan't wait to visit again - but not for at least 4 weeks.\n\n$9 for just the burger.  (That can really add up if you get a $3 soda or $4 fries)",

  "text": "This is like a Denny's, in that they offer a huge variety of foods, but in no other way - it is one hundred times better than a Denny's. When you walk in you see a wall of cheesecake and you pretty much know it is going to be a fun experience. We were fortunately seated near the HDTV at the back of the restaurant as we watched the Jets fail their faces off against the Steelers - that part sucked, but even that sucking moment was still fun since we were hanging out at the diner. We were in a big group and we also were sitting right next to another big group, the Duke University fencing team. This place draws big groups in because it has a legit reputation among everyone, locals and those from far away who had a great meal here once a long long time ago.\n\nThe big guy (4u) waiter right off the bat was friendly, gracious, and funny - top notch staff here for sure. The water was not exactly refilled at a regular pace but I guess it was pretty busy. It was really hard to choose a dinner since everything sounded so good. I finally settled on the open faced Monte Cristo, longing for 'ye olden days when that deliciousness of the Monte Cristo used to be available at Bennigan's before their shenanigans shuttered their doors across the country. Penrose does not make 'yo daddy's Monte Cristo and that is not an entirely bad thing.\n\nThis is french toast as the base, two pieces and very moist and eggy. Not fried like Bennigan's. Just french toast that is AWESOME. Then meat piled on top of the french toast. Then some cheese on top of that. And a big helping of fries. The fries were solid, the good diner kind, not the shoe string or crinkle cut or that other junk places try to pass off.\n\nI will be back for more Penrose.",

  "text": "My favorite day of the year is Labor Day, when I attend the Reno Rib Cook-Off. This year we actually were there the day before Labor Day. It was a little bit more crowded at the event but the drive back to the Bay Area was much faster than doing it on the holiday.\n\nParking is generally very easy. It can take a minute, but there are several locations that are closeby, if you're patient. The streets are closed for the event and lots of stands to choose from, selling ribs and roasted corn, or other fried, delicious foods. \n\nSampler plates (3 ribs) are about $7 - though this year we saw one as high as $9 (and it wasn't very good). and one that gave us 4 ribs for $7 (from Memphis.... served dry, without sauce - they were the BEST ever!!!)\n\nTwo restaurants local to our home make it to the Cook-Off every year: Kinders and Back Forty Texas Barbecue. Both are really good but obviously I am not going to stand in line to try them at the cook off when I can get them at home.\n\nLots of vendors sell jewelry, clothes, popcorn, etc behind the street. There are also rides for kids. \n\nThe BEST thing is that there are lots of porta-potties, and they are super clean! They even smelled good... at the end of the day! In the HOT HOT HOT sun. It was nice.\n\nSo next year: save up your money, hit up the fest, and try like 5 different rib places and then some corn... get some sodas or stop at one of the bars on the street, ...maybe do a little gambling -- and you'll definitely have a new favorite day of the year! \n\n[Make sure to get a hotel room in advance because this weekend is always booked in Reno! Completely! From Motel 6 to Grand Sierra Resort to the Nugget - everything!!]",

  "text": "Right to it: The Yelp Indy International Supper Club rolled in 26 deep for a full dinner on a Wednesday night at 7. Over in the other corner was a party of 10. I was blown away by Peter & Co.'s service.\n\nThis was my first sit down, full meal at Saigon. Expectations: High. Reality: Really High. \n\nThis place is exactly why I travel. Nearly every city in America probably has something similar -- a strip mall tucked away in a unsuspecting area -- that is thriving with authenticity. Especially here, the Banh Mi & Pho! \n\nNow... that's not all they have... their menu is, well, how do I say it, um... HUGE!\n\nFrom lemongrass beef wraps to catfish in a clay pot. I went with the finest soup & sandwich of my life: bbq pork banh mi & Pho Special of flank steak, beef brisket, beef meatballs and tripe in classic Pho fashion. \n\nMy first visit I thought I was eating bbq beef banh mi, I was incorrect -- it's some stellar bbq pork that is spot on.\n\nThe bean sprout & fresh basil side plate with the pho was a supreme touch. \n\nThe service was pretty remarkable considering he's serving a party of 26 in a restaurant that seats about 40 at most. Um, the Yelp Supper Club came through -- big time here. At the other end of the table, I salivated, and salivated, for the Vietnamese Coffee that Jessica  & Rodney were having. My lord, I have to return midday before my coffee cut off time of 3pm. \n\nAnd then, something historic happened. There it was, the banh mi bbq pork (re: photo)... it sat there with it's open profile of pork, cilantro, cucumber, carrots & jalapeno on a french roll; she just couldn't resist. She, whom is anti-pork as my Inner Rabbi, my LP, took her first banh mi bite, and I have a Sakijewa golden dollar on it that she'll return for more!\n\nAs will I!\n\nNote: Amazingly classy touch of the sides of beer six packs cut out and taped above each booth in a row to display what beers are offered (which includes 3 Viet beers!)",

  "text": "Oh, Billy Bob's, I really wanted you to be more than three stars.\n\nWhen I went here for lunch today, I was pretty excited.  I had been looking forward to checking this place out since it had opened a few months ago.  I like BBQ and sandwiches (although I'm no BBQ aficionado) and I went in with an open mind.\n\nAs soon as I walked in, my friend and I were greeted by the manager and were immediately seated.  We then met our server who was extremely friendly, attentive, and helpful.\n\nFor an app we ordered the fried pickles which came with ranch dressing and another dipping sauce.  They were really good and got me excited for the meal.\n\nI ordered the hamburger, only because I wasn't in the mood for a huge meal and my friend ordered the brisket.  I got an order of mac and cheese as my side.  When my burger came, it was dressed pretty basically with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  The burgers aren't cooked to order, and the one I had was pretty dry and over cooked.  It wasn't juicy at all and I didn't even finish it.  The mac and cheese was good, but it wasn't overly spectacular.  My friend ordered potato salad with the brisket, which I tried, and could tell that it was likely store bought (which isn't horrible, but I've had better).\n\nAll in all, the place was a solid three stars.  The staff was amazing, the atmosphere is nice and the food came quickly.  I was sad to see that there weren't more people in here.  I really am rooting for this place, especially because I think the Westbank needs an \"authentic\" BBQ place.",

That would explain the large amount of square footage, but all signs for this location, both inside and outside, clearly show this is now a Dollar Tree.\n\nAlso, any store where an employee sees a long line at one register and announces he or she is opening another register to move customers along gets my approval.\n\nI would not recommend parking in the front row of spaces just outside the front door/windows because it can be dicey backing out of those spots when leaving because it is so close to a high traffic entrance/exit to the nearby road. Use the lot away from the front of the store and you can get in and out without any trouble.",

I wasn't supposed to be in New Orleans or be staying with my friend whom I hit up last minute, but somehow we ended up here when I was already pretty shithoused, running with our umbrellas trying to beat the impending storm that never came.  The outside area upstairs is cool with a view of the Mississippi River (always makes me think of Tom Sawyer or one of those books).  However, there is only one dingy table outside AND, it's the target blasting area of some sort of restaurant ventilation so if you look cute, keep in mind that you will leave smelling like greasy french fries which makes you less cute.  \n\nDrinks are like $10 each.  EXPENSIVE!  And small sized like but I was drunk already so no harm no foul.  Mojitos are better than margaritas.  It's a huge space inside but not many people upstairs.",

  "text": "For my Two Hundredth review I give \"The Block\".  Cute name cute inside cute little meat case with cute little chunks of meat.  The service was not so cute.  The server wished she was anywhere but here waiting on us.  I feel your pain it is hard to work for a living.  But if you are not a people person than maybe you need to sit in a cube somewhere and not waiting on people with your lousy attitude and pathetically slow to non existent service.  What saves this place from something less than 3 stars is the food was very good.  I had their steak sandwich..  It was very good.  Odd instead of one slice of steak it was pieces of steak placed on the bread.  I almost felt it was leftovers from the butcher shop.  But style or not the steak was very good.  It had a nice punch to it from the pepper they seasoned it with and the gardinaire it was served with.  The steak sandwich came with fries so I asked for some ketchup.  It came out in one of those little stainless steel cups that was about 25% full.  So after about 2 fries I needed more.  Good luck with that.  Refer to server section of the review. \n\nMy son The Famous Chip K. was with me anid told me he had this server before and she was bad.  Oh well.  So go for the food not the service.

  "text": "If it were in Virginia, it'd be VA-Chinatown. And I'd come here even more. So to speak.\n\nOne thing I am certain of, is that it's more exciting that the largest city in Saskatchewan. Without doubt, you're better off in Chinatown than Reginatown.\n\nPhiladelphia has a beautiful Chinatown with little alleys and a crisscross of roads that reminds me a little bit of a slightly larger Boston Chinatown, and it's significantly better than the one in DC, but what isn't.\n\nIt's a traditional Chinatown with a big gate right in the heart of the city, which makes for a great tourist attraction. There is some really great Boba around here too, as well as some not-so-good Boba.\n\nBut I would say some of the best Boba in the Philly area is within 4 blocks of this gate, and there's plenty of amazing food located right here in Chinatown, which makes it a real destination for us, and we like it. Parking is an issue though, like at your mother's place.\n\nFor Boba try Mr Wish, KFT, Mr Camp, Tsaocaa, Tea Do (open later), and more.\n\nMy old review said:\n\nA lot of people think of NYC and San Francisco as the Chinatowns of the USA. But cities like Boston, DC, Houston and Philadelphia have wonderful Chinatowns of their own, complete with the \"gate\" and all.\n\nThe Philly Chinatown is much smaller and less-frequented than the one in NYC, but it's absolutely wonderful. It's mainly just 1 street, although technically it's several square blocks. The one street is like being in China itself, but in a Philly terraced row-houses neighbourhood setting. There's a little of everything, and if you like Chinese food and goods, you'll never get tired. There are some nice dessert and bubble tea shops along here too.\n\nPerhaps the best part is that Chinatown Philly is close to everything. It's about 10 minutes walk from the Liberty Bell and 5 minutes walk from Reading Terminal Market, which has much of the best food in town. It's one of the most notable and enjoyable little Chinese neighborhoods in North America.\n\nSo if you feel saddened or down\nI know just what will erase your frown\nWe'll both strip down naked\nSteal a car, and take it\nOut joyriding in Chinatown.",

I hope it is here to stay! \n\nThe duck confit appetizer is incredible with capers and goat cheese on the side. It's cooked crispy and tender, and is just as good as I remember it from my first trip here! The cheese board is a great option as well, they feature different cheeses and provide great sides to accompany the flavors. The board included apple slices, buttered toasted baguette slices, red and golden raisins, and these wonderful candied walnuts. YUM. \n\nI had the pan roasted lemon sole with potatoes and my BF had the duck breast with sweet potato hash. The fish was very good, but the duck breast was incredible. The waiter told us the duck is smoked and you could tell in the outstanding flavor. It was so good!! For dessert we tried the salted dark chocolate mousse with these cinnamon cookies on the side. The perfect end to our meal!\n\nGreat service, great food, I'll be back!!",

They send out this corn bread with garlic that are to die for.  Honestly everything on the menu is $20 and up but worth it because all entrees come with a salad and 2 sides.

We loved walking around the city at night and learning about the history. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the ghost tour as much as I did, but I would recommend it to anyone! \n\nThe only bad part was the actual buying of the tickets. We stopped by throughout the day and no one was there at the ticket stand. When we arrived at the tour time, the woman siting there told us not to tell anyone that she wasn't there throughout the day. Then, she refused to take our credit card. Thank god we had cash. \n\nAll in all, minus this minor mishap, check them out. Hopefully the woman who gave us so much trouble is no longer working here.",

Sail Pavilion can be a great stop for anyone biking, running, or walking the Tampa Bay Riverwalk.  This place is dog friendly with plenty of dog water bowls available so bring your furry friends! However, the service is terribly slow. Drink prices are a bit pricey at $5-7 per beer and $8-12 per mixed drink. They have a wide variety of tropical drinks including: the blue crush, pina colada, strawberry daquiri, rum runner, coco loco, mud slide, margarita, sex on the beach, mai tai, and mojito. I had the burger and shrimp wontons and they were both awful. They only have 1 waiter and 2 bartenders for the whole place.  I got tired of waiting and went up to the bar and that took over 10 minutes in a 4 deep line just to get a drink.  They need a better menu and more staff on the weekends. Especially if there is an event at the Convention Center. Sail Pavilion has food trucks almost every Friday and is a local crowd favorite gathering spot for residents of Downtown and Habour Island. Boaters can dock their boat at the marina in front of the restaurant, take a boat tour from the marina, rent water bikes, rent boats, and soak in pretty views of the boats in the marina, Jackson's Waterfront Bistro, Harbour Island, Davis Island, the Hillsborough River, and even Bayshore!",

From what I saw it goes from 3-7 &10-12 and it's 1/2 off drafts and long neck bottles. We got there around 10 on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating. We were served right away and the waitress was so friendly. First, I was shocked by how many beers they actually offer. They had about 5 different IPAs just on tap. Then, I was even more shocked by the prices! Since it was happy hour, our beers were only $2.50! I haven't been able to get a nice IPA in Nashville for less than $6. After several beers we got a little hungry and checked out the late night food menu. It was impressive. Reasonably priced bar food at its finest. I ordered the Queso chips and was not disappointed. Homemade queso, sour cream, and salsa. I mean, it was nothing fancy but for a dive bar it was pretty delicious. Overall, our tab had 5 beers and Queso chips...the total was about $19. I mean, come on! You can't find a better deal than that in Nashville. Sure, it's a dive bar in a quieter area, but hey, if you're in the area and looking to for cheap drinks, Jonny's is the place to go. Be warned, people are allowed to smoke inside so it does get to be a little much.",

In the middle of booking my appointment the waxer became avilable and I was able to be serviced right away. Yay!\n\nThe techichian (Tina) was very friendly and listened to my needs. I wanted my eyebrows cleaned up being this was my first time and did not want the tech thinning them out too much. She trimmed them and cleaned them up without affecting my shape. Perfect! The wax felt a little too warm and I was a little worried it may irritate my sensitive skin but it did not.  \n\nThe interior is so spa like and clean. Parking is a little weird as you have to drive on the lot and down a sltight space that only accomodates one vehicle at a time so make sure you proceed with caution as there could be a vehicle trying to come out while you are trying to enter. \n\nThey also gave me a nice gift bag for being a new customer with a full sized hair product and nail polish. That was a nice touch. I would say it is on the pricey side but on a day that I need to be seen right away i will definately stop in again.",

  "text": "My Yelp friends Coty and Paul asked me to join them one evening at Mei's World Pizza and Salads along Bearss Avenue, near Bruce B Downs, in the USF area. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, as the name of this place seems to imply a pizza shop, and yet Coty told me that they serve very good Taiwanese food. Hmmmm, well, she has never failed me with her selection of restaurants, and so I was game to give this place a try.\n\nSure enough, this little restaurant on the north side of Bearss Avenue looks like a pizza / sandwich shop from the outside, but inside, the place was packed with college students in the know, as well as folks looking for good Thai food. \n\nThe first thing you should know is that nothing on the regular Thai menu is priced over $10. That includes rice bowls, noodle bowls and platters, traditional Thai appetizers, and a great mix of entrées. Secondly, they DO serve pizza......and apparently you can have them put Thai or Chinese / American food on top of your pizza. Finally, if you are so inclined, they do serve pig's feet, chicken feet, chicken lips, chicken butt, and a whole lot of things that will never go into my mouth. Sorry, but I just can't picture a chicken walking around on a pair of crutches because someone wanted to eat chicken feet! Nope, it's not gonna happen.\n\nCoty ordered a number of very tasty dishes for the three of us to share, and so we enjoyed Mei's pan-fried pork buns, pepper-seasoned fried chicken (no feet, please!), hand-cut Zha Jiang noodles in a black bean sauce, and a sliced, boneless pork chop served with a tea egg. The egg was awesome, so we ordered some more of them. Mei, is of course the owner, and she & Coty got in to a very fun discussion about Coty's upcoming trip to Taiwan as well as her experiences with enjoying Taiwanese food in New York City.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal, but was glad that I went there with people who were more experienced in ordering this cuisine. The wait staff at Mei's was super-friendly, and very helpful about making recommendations about the menu.\n\nI liked this place a lot, and will gladly go back when I'm in the neighborhood.",

I saw the sign for a bakery out of the corner of my eye as I was driving down Bearss Avenue and was curious what the place was like. La Familia is a charming Mexican bakery. While there are two small tables outside you can sit at this is more of a place where you grab your items and go. There are display cases to your front and left as you walk in showing all sorts of wonderful looking treats. There are donuts, conchas, muffins, cookies, cakes, just to name a few. My favorite dessert I've tried so far was a rectangular slice of vanilla cake with peach and guava waves decorating the top.  It was delicious!  Their cuban sandwich felt like a brick in my bag it had so much weight to it.  The cuban bread was excellent also.  I've also tried their ham and egg sandwich, which also was a substantial amount of food. Their prices are also great!  I was very surprised that every dessert in the side display cabinet is only 99 cents. The people that work here were very patient with me with my endless \"What's that?\" questions. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying many different things!",

The clock tower mechanics some levels below was surely quite impressive engineering. I also enjoyed reading the history painted on the walls in the beautifully architected main court room.

We reserved the Garden District tour on a Friday morning.\n\nWe were fortunate enough to get Nancy as our guide.

She knew everything from Civil War history, to celebrity residents, to top eateries, to why chicory is the thing in local coffee. Nancy made the two hours go by quickly and was very interactive. \n\nI took two other tours on this trip, one of which had signs to courtesy tip, and the other flat out asked for a tip.

  "text": "Orange Sun Tan attendant: Are you sure you don't want to do 15 minutes? We are currently running a sale on our Magic Diamond Triple Golden Lotion - it's 50% off - only today. \n\nMe: Oh, yeah? So, how much is it now? (only to humor myself). \n\nOrange Sun Tan attendant: It's now only $49.95! Have you checked out our new spring OPI colors? \n\nMe (in my head): Damn, can't a girl fake bake without a 1,000 sales pitches each time I walk through the door?\n\nOrange Sun Tan attendant: Okay, it's going to be a 35 minute wait. Would you like to upgrade for $9.95 - it would only be a ten minute wait.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnd this, my friend, is the conversation that occurs 9 times out of 10 when you enter Sun Tan City - be it on Keystone, in Avon, East Street or wherever. I must admit, I was apprehensive of admitting my sinful use of cancer beds from time to time but my dismay with Sun Tan City was worthy of candor. I give it two stars for their overly-aggressive sales tactics and disorganized timing of bed slots. Don't get me wrong, the employees are super-friendly. There is just something bothersome about someone smiling while questioning the fact that you only want to tan 10 minutes in an attempt to save your skin from premature wrinklage and excessive freckles.",

  "text": "As I get older, I have trouble keeping up with all the fads in dining.  So when I heard about a \"Paleo\" diner, I wasn't sure what it meant.  But, being a fan of good food, I thought I would give it a try.\n\nNook has expanded their hours to include lunch, so I went the day after their first lunch serving.  As my waiter arrived, he explained how people should eat like \"cave men\":  no artificial sugars, no gluten, and no dairy.  Now, I have no animus against any food group, believing in the basic food groups and moderation to be my golden rule of dining.  But any given meal for me may step out of the pyramid.\n\nSo I gladly accepted the complementary sip of olive oil to start my meal.  It is supposed to be good for digestion.  I noted a hint of peppery flavor which was actually rather pleasant.\n\nI started my meal with a beef broth bowl.  The bowl is huge!  They start with 200 pounds of beef bones and slow cook it down to extract the rich flavor from the marrow.  The broth has daikon radish, shiitake, shredded beet noodles (yellow), onion, shredded cabbage, and topped with fresh herbs.  Yum!  Note:  You can make this a full meal by adding beef to the bowl for an additional $7.\n\nI also ordered a side of Brussels Sprouts which are shareable in size and un-shareable because the flavor is so fantastic!  I devoured the whole dish by myself.  The sprouts are halved and are grilled with shishito peppers, candied (turbinado brown sugar) bacon, and topped with a smokey paprika aioli.  The flavors were nicely layered and makes me wonder if people who say they don't like Brussels Sprouts had any idea how much they are missing.\n\nAs an entree, I ordered the short rib taco.  Instead of a flour or corn tortilla, they use ground almond which adds a nice flavor and a bit of crispness.  The short rib beef was juicy and tender, but maybe a tad under seasoned (they do have salt and pepper on each table, but I refrained from using it since I wanted to see how the flavor combos worked without it.)  The taco also has scallions, shredded napa cabbage, teriyaki, and sriracha (not very hot with all the other ingredients).  They also added shredded carrots and herbs on top.  The herbs were fresh and gave a pungent fragrance as I folded and lifted the taco for a bite.  Note:  although the tortilla holds up to the juices, some will drip out onto your plate with the orange color of the sriracha....be sure you have your napkin in place so that you don't get stained. (Whew!)\n\nThe staff was very friendly and even though they left an iceless carafe of water on the table for me, frequently did the pouring when they passed.  The front manager stopped by to see how I was enjoying the meal and even the owner came by.  I like when the folks who are supposed to be overseeing the operation actually care about listening to my feedback and don't just go through the motions.  Everything ran smoothly and the waiter even checked on a couple things for me with the kitchen to answer my curiosity.  (Note:  I go at non-peak times, so staff may have a little more time to answer.)\n\nI doubt I will switch over to becoming Paleo.  But I will definitely be back to try some of Nook's other options soon.\n\nReview #689",

It was taking upwards of 20 minutes for items that had run out on the buffet to get restocked so certainly that is an area for improvement.  The service was also very inconsistent and it took quite a while to get a drink refill.  The food was very well spiced and at a generally higher level of spice than the other area Indian food restaurants in the area.  \n\nOverall I enjoyed the food but for the moment I would advise to order off of the menu if you are in any kind of hurry.",

  "text": "Luke is a causal John Besh restaurant located in the CBD. It was one of the few good restaurants open for lunch on Saturday. \n\nWe had the corn and crab bisque to start and it was very good. For entrees we ordered the burger and stuffed shrimp. \n\nThe burger costs $16 which seems expensive for a burger (its the most expensive buyer i have ever had), but it was really good. The burger is huge and is topped by a wonderful cheese and smoked bacon. I am not a bacon fan, but apparently John Besh knows how to procure incredible bacon. The burger comes with some really good fries that are placed in a mint julep cup wrapped with paper. \n\nThe stuffed shrimp was really good and came with vegetables. \n\nThe wait staff was very attentive and friendly. I will definitely go here again. \n\nOne word of caution. We at at Luke for lunch and La Provence for dinner. I would suggest only one Besh restaurant per day. There is no way to eat that much food in a day.",

  "text": "We stopped by Sun King and thought we would check out the new Oca restaurant/shop inside. Oca, meaning \"Goose\", is a spin-off for Goose the Market that opened inside the public area of the brewery. Although they hadn't \"officially\" announced they were open, I had heard that they were open in the evenings and were working through a soft opening process. So glad we stopped by!\n\nMy wife and I both tried one of the bundled French Bread sandwiches. Tonight's featured City Ham and Gruyere with Dijon mustard, tarragon, and mini sweet pickles (cornichons). I placed our order at the counter, paid, and gave my name. They asked if I wanted the sandwiches toasted (yes!) and that allowed me time to pick up a couple drafts at the Sun King counter. As soon as I was making my way back to our table, the Oca staff called out my name and I was good to go. \n\nI loved the crispy crunch of the bread and the toasting brought out the flavors of the ham and cheese. Excellent pairing for the spices too. Can't wait to come back to try some of the sausages and charcuterie. \n\n*****update******\nI made it back one evening and decided to try the Choucrote Garnie which may as well translate to \"meat lover's dream!\"  Actually, it's a \"traditional dish of France's Alsace region bordering Germany\" and the Choucrote is fermented cabbage while the Garnie means it is dressed with Riesling (white wine), herbs, potatoes, and charcuterie.\n\n This huge option is brought out in a roasting pan.  My eyes started to glaze over at all the meats.  In the center was a large peppery Knack(wurst) nestled over a large serving of the Choucrote.  To the left was a thick (a full inch) smoked rib chop that was the most tender pork chop I've had.  In the upper left corner were two Nuremberg sausage (technically much larger at about 5 inches instead of the 9 cm traditional).  The Nuremberg have a thicker casing and more in the Bratwurst family.  To the right of the Knack were a couple slices of Pancetta that looked like American bacon, but have a higher salt content.  Just below that, there were two Strasbourg frankfurters.  Oh, and there were two potatoes that were halved and roasted.\n\nThe Choucrote itself was a great surprise at how much I enjoyed it.  My mother used to make a really nasty version of sauerkraut and dressed it with white vinegar.  I hated it!  But here, the pungent odor of vinegar is replaced by the pleasing notes of the Riesling.  The sour of the dish is tempered as well, so the overall taste is quite pleasing, especially since it is warm and served thoroughly tender. (I am not a fan of the sometimes rubbery and tough texture of raw cabbage.)\n\nThe portion size suggests it is for two to four people.  They mean it on this dish!  I made really great headway on devouring the dish, but common sense struck me before I was stuffed and decided to get a to go box.  Not for the picky eater, this is a dish that goes great with a dark beer (I went with the Sun King \"Stuck in the Middle\" Milk Stout option. Yum!)\n\n*****back to the original review*****\n\nAs if I didn't have enough reasons to stop by Sun King already, now I can get great quality sandwiches while there. Note that Oca sells packaged meats to take home if you stop by to fill your growler.\n\nTech stuff: They are open generally the same hours as the brewery.  Parking is free in the Sun King lot.  A number of platters are meant for 2 to 4 people, so bring friends!\n\nReview #439\nRev #30",

In the evening it's dimly lit, has plenty of comfortable seating, and it's as much of a coffee shop as it is a Gealteria. \n\nOn my most recent visit I enjoyed some of their gelato on their adorable patio out back. They have cafe tables with a fountain in the middle and lights strung above. The patio feels like one of the best kept secrets of Tower Grove. It's a hidden little bungalow. It's getting a bit chilly so you might have to wait until spring to check it out. \n\nThe staff is all friendly and the patrons seem to primarily consist of students studying away for their next exams. This is a great place to go with a couple friends, a date night, or even just to study alone. 5/5 would recommend.",

  "text": "I thought that I was well-versed in Middle Eastern cuisine since I know my way around the menus at Greek and Mediterranean restaurants, but clearly I was wr.....wr....ummm, \"mistaken\".\n\nPetra is an authentic Middle Eastern restaurant located in a small strip mall, just east of Busch Gardens along Busch Boulevard. If you're not paying attention you'll easy sail right past this spot -- and that would be a mistake. The restaurant is very popular with people who are familiar with this cuisine, as well as students from the nearby University of South Florida.\n\nThe food is very fresh, and cooked to order, with fresh vegetables and ingredients bought in daily from the local markets. Petra also imports some of their specialized ingredients from the Mediterranean to supplement what they can't find locally. The pita bread is baked fresh on a daily basis.\n\nIt takes a bit of time to sort through all of the great options on the menu. Your server won't rush you, but they'll gladly answer questions and make suggestions. Appetizers include some outstanding hummus and Foule, babaghanoush, falafels, stuffed grape leaves, Nabulsi fried cheese, and all kinds of other fun things to try and pronounce.\n\nYou can order a traditional Greek or cucumber salad, but they also have Fattoush, Tabouli, and Tahini salads. You'll honestly have to read through the descriptions on the menu (or beg Tiffany H to go with you) to make up your mind. I saw the puree of lentil soup on the menu and decided to give that a try. It was seasoned with cumin and other herbs along with sautéed onions and a splash of olive oil. My soup arrived at the table along with a basket of freshly-baked pita bread, and a bowl of spicy pickled vegetables. YUM!!!!!\n\nThey have a number of different sandwiches on the menu which are stuffed with shawarma or kabob meats, or you can skip right to vegetarian heaven and order falafel, hummus, or babaghanoush sammies.\n\nIf you prefer a heartier entrée you'll find platters of beef or chicken shawarma, along with sautéed diced lamb, served with a ring of homemade hummus, almonds, onions, and parsley. Petra also features daily traditional specials, and all of these entrées are priced under $15. For bigger family gatherings you can order their grilled skewers of lamb, chicken, or beef, with a variety of sides.   \n\nI had the grilled beef shawarma plate which was served with a ring of hummus around the edge of the plate, and then then diced beef piled up in the middle. That was served with sliced pickles, onions, and tomatoes. Very delicious, and plenty of food for leftovers.",

I normally go for Aussie wines because I know more about those but this place is breaking me out of my comfort zone and allowing me to confidently try some Canadian wines.\nHubby loves this place for the beer selection. Quirky beers from all over the world, some gimmicky bottles with dinosaurs or James Bond (that he can't resist).

  "text": "Russell Gardens Center in Churchville, Bucks County, Pa., may not be the largest nursery garden plantation in the region, but in my estimation it is one of the best. I have been shopping here since moving to Bucks and starting a garden around the house (The enterprise is never done).  Originally, I was tipped off to its existence by a nurseryman friend who helped me with design and bare root tree planting.  He swore by Russell's for perennials and colorful annuals and shrubs that most other dealers either lacked, or only possessed in inferior quality.\n\nAs an example, twenty years ago I bought a small pot of Coreopsis, a hardy fern-like leafy base with yellow star flowers that bloom in late June/early July, and spread to fill any space they are in.  Yesterday, I returned to see what was new in this native American beauty.  Now, they are available in a few shades of red/orange, and most strikingly, in a red/yellow flower that is breathtaking in its simplicity and kinship to its elder cousin.  Love at first sight. It is now planted across the walkway from the original, and it is easy to imagine its growth over the coming years.  \n\nWe purchased 3 other low growing, shade loving varieties to replace the old builder's grade junipers that had run their course.  Three Heuchera with rich dark maroon/gray foliage, two Veronica (Speedwell) that push up spikes of pale blue to indigo flowers in early June, and three low dark green/purple grasses that spread through their roots to cover bare soil and need little maintenance. They are all happily in place beneath the living room window. \n\nAlways more work to do.  Plans call for a redo of the west side foundation plantings.  Russell Gardens will get the call as we lay out our plans.  Their inventory, knowledge and understanding of gardens and gardeners, makes it the place I trust most with suggestions and products. Prices are about the same as the other shops. \n\nRussell Gardens is why we dig in the earth.",

  "text": "On our way home, my wife asked if I would stop at this local alterations shop to pick up a garment she had adjusted.  I will be the first to admit that I don't personally know much about sewing and alterations, but my wife does and she couldn't say enough about how reasonably priced this place is.  The woman who does the alterations is very friendly and my wife has been very pleased with the results.\n\nUnderstand that you can't usually drop off some intricate garment and expect her to drop whatever she is doing to fix it.  But my wife was in no hurry and the garment was ready in a couple weeks.\n\nThere are a couple changing/dressing rooms for visitors to try on their garments for marking and reviewing.\n\nNote that the owner only accepts cash or checks, NO Credit Cards.\n\nMy wife found the place through the local grapevine, so when I saw it was already reviewed on Yelp, I was pleased to see the reviews echoed my wife's opinions.\n\nIf you are in the area, stop by this small shop just south of the Casey's at the intersection of Bridge St and Indianapolis Rd.\n\nReview #3653",

  "text": "I had a great experience with Assurant. I purchased my old Google Pixel phone from the Google Store (online). One of the options I could add to my phone was Device Protection for $99. Device protection is the same thing as phone insurance and Assurant was the provider.\n\nThe coverage I purchased was good for two years from the date I received my phone. The maximum number of accidental damage repairs or replacements under Device Protection was two during the coverage period. My Pixel's camera lenses, both front and back, got scratched. The scratches caused light streaks in my photos and videos so I decided to file a claim and get a replacement.\n\nPer the Device Protection welcome and terms and conditions email I got from Assurant, I filed my claim at https://mydeviceprotect.com/. It was really quick and easy to do, especially since Assurant had most of my information on file from my phone's IMEI/serial number. I filed my claim on a Friday night. In less than 24 hours, someone from Assurant called to verify my information and approve my claim. I received a claim approval email after the call and a shipping notification that Monday (first business day after my claim was approved). I received my replacement Pixel on Tuesday afternoon; basically, in two business days. Fast!\n\nI did have to pay a $79 deductible, but it was totally worth it to me. It was like I got a brand new Pixel for only $178 ($99 for Device Protection + $79 deductible). Technically, the phone was refurbished, but it looked and worked like new - the battery too, which was huge, since my old battery was on its way out. Considering my particular phone model at the time, a 32-GB Pixel 1, originally retailed for $649, I thought this was a good deal. Plus, I had one more replacement remaining on my contract before my two years were up. It was nice to have that peace of mind.\n\nGoogle made it easy to transfer all of my apps and data from my old Pixel to my new Pixel. I just connected the two phones with a USB-C cable and followed the prompts. The entire transfer took about an hour (my new Pixel had to download and install almost 100 apps). I was really pleased with how simple and seamless the transition was. My old phone was essentially mirrored to my new one which was exactly what I wanted. I did have to set up new fingerprint recognition and log in to all of my apps again, but that was it. I was back up and running with a \"new\" phone with hardly any interruption.\n\nI returned my old Pixel in the same packaging that my new Pixel came in. Assurant emailed me a shipping label to print and tape to the outside of the box. I had to return my old Pixel within 14 days from the date my new Pixel was shipped. Otherwise, I could've been charged an \"unrecovered equipment fee\" of up to $2,000.\n\nIn the end, I am very happy with the Device Protection I purchased from Assurant. I already bought it again for my latest phone, the Pixel 3, for $129 (unsurprisingly, the insurance price went up).",

Prices were a bit on the higher side, but this isn't a doner kebab takeaway!\n\nYou will need a group of six people at least to reserve the spot where you can all sit around a low table with your shoes off. Good to know in the future!  We were miffed to know we were short one person to get it and we almost considered dragging someone off South Street to join us - hahaaha.\n\nThe ambiance was lovely - our table of five could easily chat and hear each other. It's definitely a white table, candle light and clinking glasses kinda place. We shared a number of different dishes, none of which I care to attempt to spell out, but everything was delicious.  I loved my Afghani meatballs, my sister loved  her kebab (not the most appetizing looking thing, but it was spiced well), and the four different appetizers we tried out were all gone quickly (they were on the smaller side, so we could each only have a bite or so each).",

Then to top it off, literally and figuratively, at the end, I added oil and balsamic vinaigrette drizzle to my pizza once it edited the oven... OMG!!!! Sheesh!!! My only disappointment was that I couldn't eat it all in one setting.  \n\nFor my beverage of choice, I opted against the water, soda, coconut water, juices options... Bring on the NOLA Beer on tap. It was my first time trying it annnnnnnnnnd I was pleased. \n\nStart to finish, this process took about 12 minutes. That's novel for pizza making. What's the secret? Is it the massive fire oven? Or the thin, flaky, buttery crust? Or the super efficient restaurant workers? Idk, whatever the reason, it happened and that made the difference. \n\nThe only draw back for THIS location, is the lack of parking. Truly this location caters to the CBD/downtown crowd and that's super cool. And since I know parking is the challenge I will face, I'll be prepared for it HEAD FIRST. And speaking about head first... Did I mention there's an option to call ahead??? I saw it, it happens and then so now BLAZE has been added to my list of places for one of my infamous #stickandmovecapers!!!!

  "text": "Have an infatuation with Mexican food? Crave perfectly roasted chicken? Adore delicious cocktails? Love really amazing locally owned restos in crazy cool spaces? If you answered yes to any of the above, I have the perfect spot for you: Rostizado! \n\nThis roasted chicken-centric brain child, from the delightful men of Tres Carnales fame, have carved themselves out a neatly packaged niche in the Mercer Wear-house building. With smart, sexy cocktails (that do take a bit of time to arrive at your table, so be patient), and a truly unique menu (there is no guacamole and salsa here, this is grown-up Mexican with thought and flavour) that is unlike anything else in the Province. \n\nI love the decor, the chill couch-lounge with vintage red TVs. The staff is incredible (especially those sporting 'man-buns', wink, wink) and the stand-outs food wise, for me, the sandwiches for lunch! - either the rosti pollo or rosti puerco. Do get the rosti papas (best roasted potatoes EVER!) and roasted cauliflower as sides, so good! And I quite liked the roasted romain hearts salad. If you like mushrooms get the queso fundido. And of course, the roasted chicken! \n\nAs this is still a very new restaurant, there are bound to be bumps and bruises, and learning curves. That's why I gave it 4, not 5 (because I know it will improve, I can't wait, and my re-review a few months from now will show that!) And I urge you disregard quick-to-judge early reviewers that may \"loose their internet cool\" after minor meal mishaps that they may portray to look like Moby Dick size mistakes.",

  "text": "Admittedly not the best first impression. I walked in to find a harried scene: tables were littered with plates, napkins and other debris; tables were out of sort; and the staff behind the counter were excitedly talking at one another (I'm neglecting to call it 'shouting'). In the midst of all of this, the manager/owner/woman in charge, took a deep breath, smiled, welcomed me in Spanish and English, and asked if I was eating in or needed to take my order to go.\n\n'To go.'\n\nI'd studied the menu online (well, pictures of) but it looks like those menus may be out of date. The menu I looked at was smaller and had been edited down. No matter, I had an idea of what I wanted: tacos and a papusa. There was a 3 for $4 taco deal* I was going to take advantage of and papusas are always a good idea. I ordered... and waited. In the time I waited, the tables weren't bused, a woman came in with a slightly unruly child to pick up a take out order, the TV showed various barely clothed men and women writhing about Miami Beach, and an older man entered sat down, got annoyed at the wait time, waved his hands, banged on the table and shouted 'Estoy aqui!' I just sat there. After more waiting (and more TV jiggling) my order was finally ready. When I got up to pay for it, the woman put her hands together and thanked me for my patience. My annoyance melted away then and there. Chismes is a small space, packed with seating. She was, obviously, in the weeds and doing several jobs at once. Sometimes all the mierda hits the fan at once. She acknowledged it and thanked me. Done. I wasn't going to belabor her agony. Besides, my food smelled great.\n\nI got home and tore into my tacos. Ridiculous. So so good. Seasoned, shredded meat, cilantro and onion never tasted so good. Add in fresh lime and Chismes' thick, green hot sauce and you have a party. The papusa came with curtido (good). The texture/consistency of the papusa was a bit tough and off-putting but I don't know if that's because I ordered a Salvadoran dish at a Mexican place. It wasn't terrible but didn't top the papusas at my local fave Salvadoran spot. The curtido didn't have the vinegar-y kick I was looking for, so I just added some green sauce and kept it moving. For as tough as the papusa was, the inner beans and cheese were very good. I'd return to Chismes but I am sticking to getting my food to go. \n\n*Seriously: why do you pay so much for tacos. You know you're ripping yourself off, right?",

Of course, the entire evening was absolutely wonderful. \n\nI'm the kind of person who checks out a menu before I go to a restaurant, and I typically know exactly what I'm going to order. At Vetri, you are presented with a menu of possibilities and asked simply to mention anything that you definitely do not want, or even that you definitely do want. Despite my Type A tendencies, I absolutely loved sitting back and letting the kitchen run the show. \n\nWe opted for the lesser of the two wine pairings, which was still very pricey. The pairings were spot on and every wine was terrific. I was impressed. I'm sure the higher-end pairing is mind blowing. \n\nCourse after course arrived during the evening, and everything was perfectly paced. I can't recall every single thing that I ate but every course was exciting. My favorites were the pastas, and there were lots of them. Another big standout for me was the antelope. I had no idea what to expect but I was really pumped to try something new. The meat was absolutely delicious - tender and lean and super flavorful. I was pretty full by the dessert course, and I'm not a huge sweets person anyway, so I mostly focused on my dessert wine, which was great. \n\nAs for a return visit, of course, I'd absolutely love one. However, with the cost for two topping out around the neighborhood of $600, it's going to be a while (or an unexpected financial windfall!) before it will happen again.

It's non-pretentious, and doesn't get *too* full, though it can get a good amount of people on the dance floor.\n\nThey don't do draft beers, only bottles. They have a decent selection though, which is nice.\n\nThere are tables along the walls, and some bar seating.\n\nI saw the Eskimo Brothers here, and they were one of the best live acts I saw that week in Nashville.\n\nI was only here for a few days and went to Layla's twice for drinks and live music. Couldn't help but come back a third time to pick up a t-shirt. It was the last one in my size, so the bartender just plucked it off the wall. It had a staple hole in it, cost $20, and smelled like beer, but it's probably the most authentic souvenir I brought back with me.",

All the food was fresh and yummy.\n\nThe atmosphere was really light, airy and open.  I guess I haven't been inside this space since it was a coffee shop over a decade ago and it still had a house configuration back then.  So the renovation may not be new to this restaurant but I really like it.\n\nThe menu has a lot of variety without being too long. And they state that they will customize any dish even making stuff vegan.  The Chili Noodles normally have chicken or beef, but I got them with fried tofu, but I also could have picked soft.\n\nIt looks like they have a liquor license now since behind the bar they're was the biggest bottle of knob creek that I've ever seen. mmmm bourbon.\n\nAlso, the name is really Singha Song Thai so I'm guessing they aren't affiliated with the Singha downtown. I submitted the change to our Yelp overlords so I guess it will changed eventually.",

  "text": "Now that I've been here for a few concerts, it's time for a review. I can't give it 5 stars because it is an arena. I much prefer a smaller to medium size venue when I see live shows. Lucky for me that most of the bands I see play in the small to medium-sized venues. \n\nThere are occasions where I do have to venture into a large space to see some of my favorites though. \n\nThe shows I've been to here are Tool, A Perfect Circle, and most recently, Florence + The Machine. \n\nThe first thing to be said for this arena is the size of it. Yes... it's an arena so it's large. Most arenas are built for NBA teams or college basketball teams. I'm not sure of the exact reason this arena was built but it seems to have been built for the local hockey team and as a concert space. Since that seems to be the case, it's somewhere in between a medium and large arena space. I don't love it but it's okay when seeing larger acts.\n\nThis last experience here, I had to take advantage of the First Aid station. I was starting to get a headache. I went straight to Bridgestone's website, found where the First Aid room was with ease and went there to get an ibuprofen. Kudos to the arena for making it easy. \n\nIn closing, if you love smaller acts but they grow to support a venue like this and they play there... you'll have a good time I believe. Buy the tickets and go have fun.",

  "text": "August 23, 2014 Saturday - 5 PM VIP Ticket\n\nAtmosphere - 4.5 stars\nBeer - 4 stars\nService - 4 stars \n\nBackground - Thanks to Yelp I got to go to another amazing beer festival.  Thanks Michael T! \n \nSoup Box - They did not list the designated driver option at all on their website for ticket sales.  I would have loved for my wife to go but to pay for a full price ticket was pointless as she was not going to drink.  After I was there I did find out that there was an option to buy.  The other thing I did not like about the website was that they did not describe what the difference between a regular ticket and VIP was.\n\nAtmosphere - Peppermill's Tuscany Ballroom which is a huge ball room that was the home to the event this year.   Which I found made moving from one station to the next with ease even after the place filled up with all the participants.  The only thing I disliked was the darkness, it made picture taking of the beer cans difficult and to the point I just gave up.\n\nBeer - The can beer has really taken off for the craft beer industry.  The two biggest advantages of a can is that it prevents light from destroying the beer.  Yes light hurts the beer, just like our skin is affected, kills cells.  The other big thing is the distribution cost; beer cans are much lighter then glass.  For me I think that some cans are more artistic, the imagery is amazing.  21st Amendment Brewery is leading the way with their clever beer names with art to match.  My favorite is Brew Free! Or Die IPA.  http://21st-amendment.com/beers/brew-free/\n    There were several breweries listed on the website that were not in attendance.  I was disappointed as the breweries I did noticed missing from the activities were the ones that do not sell in the Reno area.  \n  The best part of the night was the accessibility of some of the brew masters.  It was great talking to them and hearing the pride they take in their work.\n\nService - Thanks to all the volunteers working the event helping some these small breweries pour the beers for us.\n\nYelp's Booth - That place was rocking with a steady group of people checking the stuff out!\n\nFuture - Beer and lots of choices that you cannot get in Reno, yes I will be back.",

  "text": "It's not everyday you find yourself in New Orleans on a bayou tour. But when you do, make sure it's Cajun Encounters Tour Company. \n\nThere's something to be said for the brave folks that tour the bayou in early August. When humidity and the ambient temperature are about the same there's only so much you can do. But making the most of the experience with a smile and good attitude will never do you wrong. \n\nI spent a good month researching all the things to do on our NOLA bday trip. Every day we filled it with things to do, places to be, and foods to eat. After much research I found Cajun Encounters was an absolute necessity. \n\nFirst, know that the bayou isn't anywhere near NOLA. You'll board a nice bus that will transport you about 40 minutes north/north-east of NOLA to the bayou. From there you'll wait some more. By the time you return to your hotel it will be well into the late afternoon. So expect that this will take a good chunk of your day. \n\nWith that said, make time for this experience. I can't guarantee you'll have a similar experience to ours as every guide is unique in their presentation. But it'll be fun for sure. \n\nI was super pleased with our tour guide (his name escapes me) but he was a retired conservation officer. His tour was fantastic - we learned about the flora, fauna and all kinds of conservation efforts. No cheap photo ops with hot dogs on a stick here. I appreciated his natural approach to the tour! We saw plenty of gators in their natural habitat which (trust me) was more than enjoyable. \n\nThe only thing that could have made this experience even better was if they didn't cram so many folks into the boats. We had several large people and packing 20-something guests into these tin cans (shoulder-to-shoulder) meant very little air-flow. And of course, very little opportunity to social distance. I would have paid double for half the number of people. \n\nDefinitely take the weather into account. Bring your camera. And enjoy!",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because I already know I'll be a regular.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI didn't know much about Sprouts, but I read a few articles about it as they prepared to open, and I knew I'd be visiting as soon as I could. If a place near my house opens that has groceries, especially specialty and/or healthy groceries - I'm going to be there really often.\n\nMy first visit was the third day of Sprouts being open. If I was claustrophobic, I may not have made it out of there alive. I don't think I've ever seen this many people in a grocery store. But I pushed through the crowd and definitely saw plenty of great stuff! Whether you're looking for specialty groceries, organic produce, or fresh meals you can simply heat up - you'll find it worth your time to fight through the new store crowds.\n\nI ordered the italian trio sandwich and was a bit off put when I got home to see that it was on very basic wheat bread, and that it included mustard, which was not noted on the menu board. My wife ordered a panini, and I was so jealous, that I returned the next night to order one of my own.\n\nThis time, I went with the caprese panini, but I added the meat from the Italian trio. I can't recommend this combination enough - it was amazing.\n\nI do want to point out that the sandwich ordering process seems a bit convoluted. There are little ordering sheets for when you order something custom, which is confusing and definitely seems like what you have to use for any sandwich. There are different types of these sheets, which adds to the confusion.\n\nWhen the sandwich maker is putting your order together, they don't do it in front of you. They take your order, and head to the back, and out pops your sandwich a few minutes later. They did not ask me for any clarification on my order during either visit, hence the unwanted mustard and bread on my first round. Also, it took an inordinate amount of time to make my sandwich on the second night, but I'll chalk that up to it being their first week open. It was just frustrating to see 10-15 employees on the other side of the counter, but only one making sandwiches. Again, we'll chalk these issues up to the first week blues.\n\nIn the long run, the only bad thing about Sprouts opening is that I feel like there's going to be a casualty in the neighborhood. Between Publix, Whole Foods and even Abby's... can all of these survive in such a small area? I don't know, but I'm going to enjoy them all as long as I can.",

Don't sleep on those sprouts - garlic and asiago were meant to be friends with those babies. \n\nI got the Whiskey BBQ burger - a tasty combo of smoked beef, smoked gouda, caramelized onions, whiskey barbecue sauce, and the ringer that drew me in - sweet potato chips. I was never a \"potato chips on my sandwich\" kind of person, but this was a great combo. \n\nThe biggest disappoint came with my meal-ending splurge of a scoop of ice cream. The hot chocolate and marshmallow variety caught my eye, as those two elements are two of my favorite things. Unfortunately the end product was very icy and crunchy - not what I was hoping for. I come from the dairy state so maybe I'm spoiled, but for me a smooth, creamy texture is crucial in a premium ice cream. \n\nAll in all it was a fun night and I'd return, if only to shove some more of those Brussels sprouts in my face.",

I've tried a good number of items on the menu.  I've finally figured out my favorite!\n\nThe sandwiches are where will get the extraordinary flavor. They mesh different flavors and they work pretty well. My favorite is the banh mi. It's not traditional by any means. It's a great fusion and I love it. I also ask for a side of Asian and Sweet barbecue sauce to dip it! I love dipping!! \n\nFar East is my second fave! It's with the Asian Bbq sauce. If u can't handle a little bit higher level of spicy. Ask for the kimchi on the side and test it out! \nI also tried the Conquistador, but that was the least favorite. If you like a sunny side egg on a sandwich that's your go to!\n\nFor their sides, their fries are the best! They are not too salty! Their mac and cheese is quite smokey(not my thing). Their corn on two occasions were good with the cheese, but overcooked & small kernels. If the kernels shrivel up, they r over cooked in my eyes. The fried okra is a close 2nd favorite but the ends r kinda hard. The potato is small. Half the size of your fist.\n\nIf You Are going to get brisket, get sliced so it can be moist. The chunks were dry and hard. The favorite meat of choice is pulled pork.\n\nI do want to try the wings which seem to be a special on Tuesdays. I also want to try their ribs! \n\nExcited to have a new non chain spot in Wesley Chapel! Thank you for being in town!",

While I've enjoyed yoga in the past, I've never felt so excited to go to class and felt so good afterwards.\n\nWhile I still don't have any other hot yoga classes to compare it to, I've now taken classes with several instructors and really have been enjoying my experience overall. \n\nA few weeks after the grand opening trial class, I came back and got the new client package. For $40, I get 30 days of unlimited yoga. It's been great because I've been able to practice with several of the instructors including Julia, Ashley and Liz.\n\nSeveral classes are offered each day and it's really easy to work them into my schedule. I love the fact that classes are offered at 6am on Tuesday and Thursday! \n\nAll of the instructors have been great and have had similar philosophies on yoga- they really encourage you to practice at your own level. The classes have been challenging but I've really been comfortable knowing my own limits and not fearing judgment. \n\nI'm especially enjoying the class with Julia and most of my visits to Priya have been with her as the instructor. I've found her classes to vary from week to week, but still have a consistency to them. I like that she offers corrections and pose variations without drawing from the class or overall flow. She's friendly and has a great sense of humor which makes the class even more enjoyable. And as much as the core work hurts at the time, I know I am getting a killer ab workout. \n\nEveryone at the studio is just so great and the environment is very welcoming. I'm also really finding myself liking the music they play and I'm definitely able to recognize some tunes. For example some Jack Johnson music was playing at class the other day. While it's not the music I'd traditionally think of for yoga, it adds an extra fun element to my experience. \n\nWith the winter months among us, the 95 degree heated room feels absolutely amazing. I've never felt more relaxed in Savasana in my life. \n\nLooking forward to many good times to come at Priya Hot Yoga.",

  "text": "A couple of \"ho-ho-holiday\" tips about take-away meals and good gift ideas all in one because in addition to baked goods - and excellent English Muffins (see first review) - Certified has prepared meals and soups to go in the freezer case in the shop.  Good prepared food makes a welcome gift any time of year: think as for working parents with school age kids, parents with a new baby, neighbors who just had surgery, your host and hostess who probably don't need another bottle of wine but who can always use a frozen meal to heat and eat next week, senior aged friends and family who have trouble cooking for themselves... The opportunities to share these - and to buy them to use at home - are boundless all the time including holidays.  \n\nThat's the top line.  Details follow.\n\nALL THE TIME OPTIONS:  You'll find in the freezer case. (Have tried them all.)\n\n*Certified Lasagna with beef, Italian sausage, pancetta of The Wylder recipe - this is the same family that owns that downtown area eatery (in small and large sizes to feed from 6 to 10 I think - $39 & $78)\n \n* Mac n Cheese in super cheesy four-cheese style using penne (in small and large sizes to feed from 4 to 8 I think - $12 & $24) \n\n*Chicken Pot pies (to feed 1 or 2 with lots of tender chicken, peas, carrots, potatoes in delicious sauce and excellent crust -  $14)\n\n*Vegetarian Enchiladas (small - 3 enchiladas fed 2 at our house- and large sizes - filling may change seasonally but our winter purchase was cubed roasted sweet potato and pintos with just enough chili kick - yummy - $12 & $24)\n\n*Assorted 32 oz soups - we picked up Tomato Bisque (still in our freezer) and Pumpkin Curry (delicious) and also saw Potato Leek and Veg Chili in the case.\n\n(12/27 update - Certified offered wild mushroom VEGETARIAN LASAGNA as an option on order in advance Christmas holiday menu - I ordered a couple.  A bit much cheese for us but glad we tried it.  If you enjoy super-cheesy style lasagna this is a fit for that preference.)\n\nSPECIAL HOLIDAY MENUS 2019:   This year they offered holiday specialty take out menus for Thanksgiving and Christmas, both of which required placing orders several days in advance by email or phone and picking up orders in a specific time window on a certain day.  Convenient if you're hosting or being hosted to be able to pick up good food to go and if they expanded the pick up day and time options that would be even more swell.\n\nFRIDAY SURPRISE I HOPE THEY'LL CONTINUE:  As \"What a GREAT idea\", for a couple of consecutive Fridays Certified posted on FB that they were offering rotisserie whole chicken, roasted veg and ciabatta one week (biscuits the other) as take out for $35 (+/-...the price varied).  Limited amount, pick up starting at 5:30ish.  The first week was first come, first served and they sold out quickly.  The second week they offered 'call to reserve' option for the 5:30 - 7:00 pick up window.   PS - being the \"Portlandia\" type I am I did ask where the chickens come from and the answer that they are Mary's organic - a very good brand - makes this all the more excellent. \n\nSERVICE:  Friendly, friendly, friendly.\n\nPARKING:  A considerable challenge in the North End and in particular for people like me who need accessible parking.  (I have had MS since college days.)  So it goes.  For anyone who doesn't live walkable distance from Certified, this North End neighborhood parking is a bear.  That is what that is.  And it is what keeps me from being a regular here.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Newly opened as remodeled from a building that was once Certified upholstery and rug cleaners, this is one of the few businesses in the North End that has tried to be equally accessible for people with mobility limits. ADA met for entry the door, standard height seating availability and the loos too.  Good for them for those minimums met.  The Civil Rights law of ADA is 30 years old so they should be no surprise to a building designer.  Yet I saw a wheelchair parked outside on snowy day because path of travel when people are inside was too narrow for minimum passage required.\n\nA NOTE ON SEATING IF YOU'RE EATING IN:  Seating at low tables is convenient for eating a bakery item or sandwich.  But it is not particularly comfortable as seats themselves are smallish round stools.  This is probably a \"perch and go\" even for someone of my size 2 frame and maybe really not comfy for larger folks to be a \"linger and nosh\" kind of place for that reason.  But it is a pleasant space with lots of light and sparkling clean decor.  For me it will be all about the take away I think.",

  "text": "Listen. As healthy as we all try to be, there's nothing wrong with waking up on a Sunday morning craving a freshly-baked donut. It happens to me quite a bit (probably way more than it should), and when the feeling hits, Donut Drive-In is where I go. I can confidently say that they have the best donuts anywhere in St. Louis, hands down. \n\nHeads up, the parking lot is a little small and can be interesting to navigate if it's busy inside. That brings me to my next point, which is that the inside of Donut Drive-In is smaller than you can imagine. As in, if there are more than a handful of people inside you'll have to wait out the door small. Which is something I'll gladly do, but I would've liked knowing that before my first visit. Third note: bring cash. You won't need a lot... if you're buying for less than three or so people, five bucks should cover it. On my most recent visit I had a chocolate long John (oh my God, drool-worthy) and a vanila custard donut for a grand total of $1.89. I felt like I was stealing. \n\nThe donuts here just taste fresh and have the perfect texture and consistency... and I love seeing all the action behind the counter! The young girls that work the register are as sweet as can be, too. Just a wonderful, tiny, thriving local business. I'm a huge fan and there's a big chance you'll spot me if you stop in on a Sunday morning. Hooray for donuts!",

I love both, I know plenty of people who have been involved with both, and both definitely have their strong points and imperfections. But when it comes down to it, City Paper is something that I tend to flip through, whereas I actually tend to stop and read a lot more things in PW. it really knows how to draw you in.\nI also feel that PW does a better job of sponsoring events. They were one of the major backers for this things like Popped Fest and realizePhiladelphia. and you can't go wrong with what they've done with Rittenhouse Square's Concerts in The Park series over the past few years.\nCity Paper does have the better entertainment section by far though.",

I don't understand all of the low reviews for this TJ Maxx!\n\nThis is a fairly new store- I think they built this new one at the same time that they built the new TJ Maxx on the Westbank.

She ended up finding a nice piece of luggage that was perfect and well priced.\n\nI browsed the women's clothing and housewares, but didn't find anything that I absolutely needed, but I found that they had a nice selection of seasonal clothing and a lot of good deals.

The chef was generous with the fish, afterall it was $16 per roll.  Sushi grade fish is in the range of $20-$30 per pound, so no matter how you cut it, sushi is going to be expensive.  \n\nEach roll was lightly seasoned with vinaigrette and a touch of sesame oil to bring out the natural flavor of sushi grade fish.  Too many restaurants in Santa Barbara overwhelmed their rolls with cheap fillers such as mayo and cucumbers, but not here.  The SB roll was the best roll I had in Santa Barbara.  It was covered in huge satisfying pieces of albacore that was flavorful, light, and not over seasoned.",

It's pretty unlike me to not plow through my sushi, leaving no trace, but I actually didn't even finish my rolls. They were fine, but not exceptional. My friend had a few of the larger special rolls and the pieces were cut so large she actually ended up choking on one - thankfully, she was fine.  \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was when I went to wash my hands in the restroom and saw how filthy it was.

We also noticed what looked like a large space for bigger groups.\n\nOur food arrived and looked great. Several other people were also seated during our time there and it was starting to get busy by the time we left.\n\nWe both enjoyed our meals and would recommend to others.

  "text": "This Federal Donuts is located inside Whole Food's, in their new food court, also has been referred to as \"restaurant row\". \n\nWhile I was shopping at this Whole Foods, I decided to try Federal Donuts. I came around 1:30 pm. There was no line but had to wait as 2 employees were busy filling an order for the woman waiting near the register. After that, this male employee took my order. I decided to get:\n\nStrawberry Lavender, $1.75- This was served warm and had a nice flavor of sugar strawberry. The lavender was subtle.\n\nPeach Ricotta, $2.75- I was curious as to what this would taste like and decided to order this. This donut has a glaze of peach and the middle is filled with ricotta. The peach is a little too sweet. Please note that this donut was not served warm and is considered a fancy donut, thus a higher price. I did not know this since there was no sign on the display case to indicate these are fancy donuts (I don't eat donuts often). \n---------------------------\n(Total= $4.50, tax included)\n\nI was disappointed that the donuts fell apart too easily and made for a mess. They just didn't hold up, compared to other donuts that I have had before. \n\nI was also very disappointed with my visit when I came here. After I made my order, I gave the employee my credit card and he gave me a pager. After waiting 14 minutes with no buzzing or lights on the pager, my husband walked back up to the register to ask the employee where our order was. He apologized and said he completely forgot about us. Please note that after my order, there was only one other person who was waiting for their chicken sandwich. Then the place was empty. The 3 employees behind the counter were just talking to each other. This employee began placing our donuts in a bag and said he would give us extra as an apology for making us wait. I didn't know why it took so long and just assumed they making my donut fresh or something. \n\nI don't get what all the hype is all about with Federal Donuts. Is it because they sell chicken too? \n\nThis place really was just average for me. But with the long wait time (if my husband had not inquired, then who knows how long we would have waited. And we were sitting at a table right in front of the register so the employee must have known we were there waiting...). I would not come back here. \n\nPlease note that this location only takes credit and debit cards are payment.",

I unfortunately do not relax with waterfall music, it makes me want to pee, so we changed it to a regular station and they were cool with it. \n\nMy massuese Ellis and I had a great convo as he worked on my therapuetic massage with refreshing citrus oil.

It's in the Marigny, which is definitely my favorite place to watch a parade. \n\nSo, no surprise here that you're going to see the likes of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other science fiction characters that MAY, I ain't gonna lie, have gone over my head. But if you're a fan of such things, you will adore it. There are throws, sure, not of the quality and quantity of the big parades, and some of them are adult-oriented (I got some pills, lol), other things like roses and toys. The party in the Marigny surrounding this parade is also not to be missed. You can tell the folks in this parade are diehards and put a lot of time into their costumes and floats. Nothing like certain other krewes where some masked members just want to be dicks and throw bags of beads at people's heads. Here we've got nice, creative people just coming together to celebrate their nerdly love for sci fi (I'm a nerd too, I don't judge) in a parade is a wonderful thing to witness.\n\nPro Tip: Catch it on St. Claude for better viewing, or if you prefer to be amongst the partying crowd around Franklin, that's a great option, too.",

For our entrees we had the orange chicken and Mongolian beef, our go-to selections.  The orange chicken had a great crunchy batter and was covered in just the right amount of orange syrup.  The beef was oddly tender, almost like tofu.  It had a bit of spice and laid on a bed of crispy white noodles.  \n\nService was overall quick and very friendly.  Our sever (possibly Mae herself?) even boxed our food for us.\n\nWe had an appetizer and two generously sized entrees with rice for under $30!  Not a bad deal!  This restaurant is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants in Tucson.",

  "text": "Lobster Haven Shanty and Market needs to rename themselves Lobster HEAVEN because this place is phenomenal for seafood lovers! This place looks and feels like a little Maine lobster shack -- not too fancy on the outside, but incredibly delicious food on the inside.\n\nLobster Haven is located in a non-descript little strip mall along W. Hillsborough Avenue in Oldsmar. You'll find the restaurant / seafood market in between the shopping center with the Super Target (Montague Street) and the shopping center with the Lowes, Publix, and Cracker Barrel (Race Track Road). It's best to use your GPS the first time you visit as you can easily sail by without spotting the sign.\n\nI remember this store from years ago when they were in a small standalone building directly across the street from the Oldsmar Flea Market. They've now moved south just a bit, and set up shop at this new location.\n\nLobster Haven is both a seafood market as well as a seafood restaurant, and it is a great place to find fresh shellfish and seafood in the NW corner of Hillsborough County. You'll find live Maine lobsters, shrimp, clams, mussels, oysters, crawfish, and crab (Dungeness, Snow, King, and Stone). Sometimes they also have blue crabs and garlic crabs, but you should call ahead to double check. You'll also find fresh and frozen seafood ready to toss on the grill. The lobster is flown in LIVE from Maine, and you can walk over to the tanks to see the happy little crustaceans scrambling around for your viewing pleasure.\n\nNow in addition to that, Lobster Haven is an outstanding little seafood restaurant with Lobster and Clam Chowda (New England style, of course!), crab cakes, smoked fish spread, shrimp cocktail, shrimp baskets, peel 'n eat shrimp, Ahi tuna, scallops, salmon, fish tacos.........and then we have the lobster...... *insert choirs of singing angels here*\n\nYou'll find lobster rolls made with huge chunks of lobster meat in a top-split bun, lobster (or crab) wraps, Lazy Man Lobster (hand picked lobster meat spread out on top of crackers), and then you've got your choice of 4 different styles of Lobster Haven Shanty Buckets o' Lobster with ever-increasing amounts of shellfish to go along with your freshly-steamed lobster, ear of corn, seasoned red potatoes, and a fluffy Parker House roll.\n\nNow by freshly-steamed lobster, I mean that the guy came out of the kitchen, picked the lobster out of the tank, walked it back into the kitchen, and a bit later out came my Bucket of Steamed Shellfish.\n\nI had the Silver Bucket which was a steamed 1 1/2 pound Maine lobster, Middle neck clams, sautéed Black Mussels, Steamed Shrimp and Crawfish along with the corn, potatoes, and a roll. I forced myself to start the meal with a cup of their amazing lobster chowder which had big chunks of potatoes and lobster in a thick & creamy New England style stock.\n\nYou can buy everything live and take it home to cook it, or you can kick back with a nice cold beer and let them do the work for you. Make it a point to go visit these folks soon!!!",

  "text": "Formerly the Red Lion Resort, then until 6 months ago, the Fess Parker Resort, Hilton has licensed from the estate the original Daniel Boone as a partnership where so many instances of Fess still remain.\n\nIt has a grand entrance and extravagant lobby that features a $29 breakfast buffet (it's good), coffee café, and Fess Parker wine tasting room (reservations required).  The best feature is the location -- right across the street for the beach.  If you lucky enough to have that view from your room.\n\nThe rooms are decorated nicely with modern furnishings, but it feels more like an apartment than ritzy hotel resort.  No getting around that, as the property design is sprawling 2 story buildings.  The $407/night price-tag got me a beach view, which I appreciated, but was far from elegant.",

  "text": "Anthro is definitely one of my all time favorite stores EVER! Their entire collection of home decor, accessories, candles and clothes is so thoughtfully curated with a certain bohemian-esque, naturally chic, trendy, yet classic aesthetic. \n\nThis location also carries bridal! And oh my goodness it is all so gorgeous! I adored my wedding dress but dang, I wish they had their BHLDN label available back then! Every dress is super romantic and feminine. They also have bridal lingere, swimsuits, veils, shoes and headbands. I always find myself drifting to this section when I'm shopping here. They politely ask me if I need help and I get embarrassed as I'm an old wifey at this point and quickly walk away with flushed cheeks. Brides, run here!\n\nI truly cherish every piece I purchase here. All so unique and definitely more special pieces versus run of the mill department store items that everyone will have. You just feel a little extra special wearing something form Anthro. I still have the 1st dress I ever purchased here and that was for the first wedding I attended with my husband, then BF 10 years ago! I'm definitely not one to hold onto clothes that long, but I still love it as much as the day I bought it. \n\nAnthro has also been know to collaborate with designers from all over the world! They partnered up with one of my favorites Mara Hoffman. You never what's around the corner....\n\nTheir housewares are possibly my favorite! Ordinary items absolutely beautifully designed. Kitchen Goods, planters, candles, linen napkins, throw pillows, comforters. It's all so lovely! Anything from here makes a truly lovely gift. In fact, I hit Anthro up every holiday season! \n\nPrices can be a bit much but really, quality is key. \n\nCustomer service is top notch. You will be greeted the second you walk through the door. They will start fitting rooms for you so you don't have to carry your goods around. They communicate via walkie and will contact someone on another floor to help you find what you're looking for. They also offer personal shopping! \n\nAs a former visual merchandiser for years I can certainly appreciate not only the ever changing amazing window displays, but the carefully merchandised products, as well as the seasonal displays! They are on top of everything! I mean I most recently visited on a Sunday then two days later and everything was fresh and re-merchandised. \n\nThis building alone is absolutely STUNNING! For those who remember way back to the 90's this was the flagship location of Urban Outfitters, who is a sister to Anthro. I used to sneak down here in middle school and blow my entire allowance on one awesome item! From the entrance to the decorated elevator, to the spiral staircase, to the faux fireplaces, hanging mobile and stained glass Tiffany-esque rotunda! Wow! That space alone is worthy of a visit. Being situated across from beautiful Rittenhouse Square Park isn't too shabby either! If you're from out of town and have never been to this gorgeous location, I highly recommend it!\n\nAnthro, along with Free People, Urban Outfitters, BHLDN, and Terrain are all owned by the same company which goes by URBN. Their headquarters are right here in Philly! I absolutely LOVE this! In the last few years they moved offices from Columbus Blvd to a beautiful space in the Naval Yard. Their company is very laid back, allowing their employees to even bring along pups to work! So cool! I can certainly get behind a company like that!\n\n*If they don't have something you're looking for in stock they will ship it to your house free of charge. \n\n*Sign up for their emails. They run great sales around the holidays and their catalogs make for great coffee table browsing material.",

  "text": "My family got all dysfunctional after my grandma passed away in 2008, so Thanksgiving and Christmas really circled the drain.  Eventually, my older brother gave up and started heading to his in-laws for the holidays.  For me, sometimes I spend the time with La Chica's fam or I will go eat some dinner at a restaurant with my introvert mother.  Well, in 2016 introverts united the latter scenario played out this year.  \n\nI checked the interwebs for restaurants that were open, but they were all chains.  Denny's, IHOP, Ruby Tuesday, Capital Grille and Flemmings.  Of these, Capital Grille was the most intriguing.  They were running a turkey day special that sounded on point, but momski wasn't feeling the fancy vibes.  She just wanted some grub in a down-to-earth atmosphere.  At that moment, I had an idea.  Why not drive down Main Street and see if anything is open?  She was game, so off we went.  \n\nEnter Bascetti's.\n\nThe place is quaint, and it was busy.  We had an advantage though--a party of two.  Walked right in and got a table.  Ordered up a cinnamon-free white sangria, some bread that was served in a mug and the antipasto misto appetizer.  Everything was perfect.  \n\nFor dinner, I wanted the shrimp scampi, but their shrimps aren't local, so I went with plan B, the chicken parm.  I could see from the Yelp pics that it is served on a bed of linguine and red sauce, so I altered that to a side of Alfredo linguine.  How was it?  I am certain I've never had such a thick, tender and juicy chicken breast.  For real, it was cooked perfectly.  I'm convinced that It couldn't have been better.  Unfortunately, I found the linguine to be a little weak in the knees.  It lacked that pungent, sharp, cheesy oomph that I expect in an Alfredo sauce.  It wasn't bad though, just a little bland.\n\nMy moms ordered the bolognese pappardelle, and it was a weeener for sure!  Big-ass bowl of ribbon pasta mixed up with thick, hearty Italian meat sauce.  What kind of meat, you ask?  Veal and pork, that's what kind.  \n\nNext was dessert, and since it was Thanksgiving, we had to do at least one traditional thing.  You guessed it, pumpkin pie and whipped cream.  Probably wasn't the best pumpkin pie ever, but I was just happy to be eating the stuff.  It's one of those tasty food things that always makes me wonder why it's glory is limited to one day per year.\n\nThe staff was extremely attentive and friendly.  My only beef was that they were really grabby.  One guy snatched up our loaf of half-eaten bread, which I definitely wanted to keep.  Another woman kept taking our flatware, and a third employee grabbed my mom's white Russian before she got the last 2 or 3 sips from it.  None of that is worth docking a star though.\n\nSo yeah, in summary, this place is legit.  The 3 star Yelp rating shouldn't steer anyone reading this away.  Both of our dinners were, as the young kids say, on fleek.  I'm going 4 star for round 1, but I'm not ruling out the possibility of a 5 star on a future visit.",

  "text": "Conventions are the only reason I stop in Indianapolis these days, so I know the ICC fairly well. \n\nConvention centres run from backwater warehouses to impressive glass and steel complexes. Though always large and fairly modern, the ICC has undergone a transformation in the past few years. This behemoth sprawls over several city blocks in the heart of downtown, connected by skybridges and underground walkways to hotels, parking, and a 30+ store shopping mall. Make sure to review the many diagrams and maps posted around the convention hall to find your way, otherwise it's easy to end up roaming in circles.\n\nClean spaces, technological features like wi-fi, and a wide, airy design are definite pluses. The central atrium and its wings are brightly lit with skylights. The rooms range in size from smaller meeting rooms like you'd find in a hotel to the massive exhibit halls used for everything from doctor's meetings to one of the largest gaming conventions in North America. Staff is well-equipped to help direct people. \n\nOn the downside, navigation can be difficult, there are too few numbers of couches or chairs outside the meeting rooms -- especially during busy conventions, when it can be impossible to find a spot to sit except the floor -- and the washrooms leave a lot to be desired. The ladies' rooms feel old and inadequately serviced. During the peak of the season, be advised locker space and other security measures are pretty limited to non-existent.\n\nOnsite eating options include pizza, hot dogs, sandwiches, cafe food, and coffee. However, going two blocks in any direction opens up wider options for an expected upcharge, but you can find bagels, upper-end steak (Ruth Chris), bar fare (Champps) or Chinese (PF Chang's) all without too much of a walk. The ICC is well-served by public transportation, though I advise anyone to park their car at an adjacent lot and walk. It's otherwise very expensive.",

I had some time to kill around noon today, so I figured that I'd head to this place after work to see what has everyone so excited about the tofu hoagie.... I eat a lot of Vietnamese food each month. It's something that I just tried about two years ago and love it. But have never gone with the tofu hoagie...It was pretty good and tasty.. It's something that I'd have again.. The store itself is a store that I wish that I had in my neighborhood.. They had a variety of drinks and snacks that you just don't find at your local convenience store.. The service made a good first impression... It's a nice change from the convenience store norm these days, which has no  problem having the register counter full of blunts and wrappers, legal pipes, condoms, and \"energy\" (stamina) pills... All of the shit that most people don't want to have in reach of their kids, when there should be candy and gum there for them to reach for.... Hell, even Wawa has stooped to selling blunts....\nGood job Fu-Wah... If I didn't live across the bridge, I'd be a customer of yours daily...",

The place is small with only a couple of tables but has a very warm, inviting feeling to it with the stoves burning brightly behind the counters.  They have lots to choose from so we ordered:\n\n- Tandoori chicken flatbread ($6.33) - comes with tandoori chicken, cilantro, cheese, lettuce and tomato. Baked fresh and was very light/refreshing. Not the biggest but it hits the spot for lunch.\n- Beef donair ($6.33) - my buddy had this one. Pretty much same toppings as mine except for beef donair meat.\n- 2x Zaatar deluxe ($3.95 each) - we both tried out their zaatar which was a Lebanese style wrap with tomatoes, cucumbers, mint and labneh ($1.25 extra). It was an interesting taste.\n\nOverall, cool place on the northside. I didn't realize that they are the ones that make the pita bread you see in the grocery stores! Will have to try their baklava and fatayer next time I drop by.",

  "text": "As a vegetarian for a few years now, I can't say I ever crave the taste of meat, including burgers. \n\nBurger Study offers the Beyond Beef veggie burger that \"bleeds\" (from the use of beets) and was created for omnivores to give it a shot in the hopes that it'll convince them to not eat as much meat. I was excited, at first, to see that this place carried this. \n\nNow that I've tried it, I hope that Burger Study will look into creating their own veggie burger, in addition to the Beyond Beef patty that they currently use. I feel that the Beyond Beef burger option was an \"easy way out\" for them. Put it on the grill and it's done....not much effort involved. It tastes eerily a lot like meat and the bleeding part is just weird for me.\n\nI tried a few of the sides while dining here (all of which come separate). They were all a-okay but the portions are way too small for the price tag that comes along with them. I honestly don't remember which apps we tried as nothing left a major mark for me.\n\nMy biggest issue with Burger Study: the price tag + the small portion sizes just don't add up. I always create two meals when I dine out. I ate all of my burger (and sampled a few apps) and was still hungry.\n\nMy favorite part of the dining experience was the bourbon milkshake.... now THAT was yummy and worth the price tag. They bring out the milkshake and then pour the bourbon into the milkshake in front of you. Pretty neat. \n\nIn terms of decor and interior: it could use some work. It takes the restaurant name fairly seriously. Books around and some random photos and that's about it. \n\nBurger Study has the potential to be a great place; however, at the time of this writing, there are other, better burger spots around Indy that I'd recommend checking out before this place, especially for you vegetarians/vegans.",

The lunch special is now $9.00 but you get a magnificent bowl of food. I get the shrimp and grilled pork bowl with cold vermicelli noods (had to say it). Their fish sauce dressing is a little sweeter than I'm used to so I add a little fish sauce from the table to salt it up. They've got the best chili oil too, which I apply liberally to each bite!

The young employee who helped me there was very nice and assured me that it would be waiting for me. But early in the morning I received a call from U-Haul saying my reservation was ready, but at another location that was much farther from my house and the major highway I needed to drive on. I was not happy with the change but needed to utilize the truck so I journeyed deep into the heart of Trenton to pick it up. \n\nThis business has a large semi secured lot in an industrial area,  it seemed pretty safe so I felt somewhat better. When I entered I was greeted by William, who processed my reservation and diffused my annoyance, first with a personal antidote, and then by knocking my mileage rate from .99 to .79 to make up for having to drive out of my way. I wasn't expecting that but it actually made the total cost less than had I picked it up in the burbs. Now that is customer service. And it serves to illustrate that  good CS can be demonstrated in many situations, provided you have happy and well trained employees to give it. \n\nThe checkin and checkout process moved quickly and details were well explained( even on the trip back to return it, with a different employee ) The truck itself was ok, no hand truck but I had my own. Also no ramp on this model but it was suitable for my task. It drove well and even though the suspension was like a bucking bronco, the seat was comfy and cushioned the ups and downs. I came away feeling that U-Haul as a company did pretty well by notifying me early and providing another location to get what I needed, and that by having employees like William, they do care about CS.",

  "text": "Interesting place with enough that made it \"interesting\" that I can't see a four star rating.  No bathroom for customers.  None of the variety of Thai pepper offerings (typically dried, ground, in oil and as a sauce) but they did offer a homemade version that was pretty good.  No limes available with their Thai dishes.  \n\nI had the Pad Thai and thought it was a bit strange.  I opted for the vege option and it came out with a visible amount of broth on the plate...thus making me nervous that I would wear some spatter.  The flavor was good but not what I was expecting from a Pad Thai and I just could not get over the amount of liquid on the plate which made me incredibly nervous about wearing the dish.  \n\nI am glad I tried the place but really can't see myself going back there anytime soon.",

  "text": "We try to stay at a different place every time we visit NOLA. So while booking our last trip H decided we should try Hotel Monteleone. We arrived late afternoon and upon entering the lobby I felt like I took a step back in time. There is a gorgeous antique Grandfather Clock in the middle of the lobby (which by today's standards is a bit small but oh so elegant!) There was another couple in front of us so I sat with the luggage while H checked us in which did not take long. We were directed to a set of elevators. I asked H which floor we were on & breathed a sigh of relief when it wasn't 7 or 14 (these floors boast the most ghost encounter with 14 having the most activity). Like the lobby & elevator our room was small but beautiful. Gorgeous drapes, bedding, wallpaper, furnishings....and the bathroom which was tiny but had quality fixtures, towels & toiletries. I immediately went to the bed to check the pillows out. I spied them in the lobby gift shop on the way to the elevator & just knew they would be heaven. And they were! My sleep experience in the bed was wonderful. The mattress was very comfortable, linens soft and pillows cloudy-ecstasy! \n\nUnderstated elegance would describe this place to a tee. The staff were courteous,exceedingly nice & unobtrusive. To date the best hotel experience in the French Quarter and the next time we visit NOLA it will be very hard not to repeat my hotel experience here.\n\nThey say the French Quarter starts in the lobby of Hotel Monteleone. And what a nice welcome this place is & a great start your adventure.",

You have the ability to order food and pick it up from the bar. There was no music or entertainment, just drinks. \n\nIf you're looking for an intimate place to go, this is your place. However, I was looking for more of a fun vibe with music and food options. I may have been looking for that Trader's Vic vibe with food, music, and drinks.

I tasted one of their noodles dish and it completely lacked flavor as well as moisture.  I can usually tolerate a lot of food but that was just gross.\n-I decided to venture out of my comfort zone (aka ordering Pad Thai at every Thai place I go to).  I got the Rahd Na (stir fried baby corns, broccoli, and carrots in soybean gravy sauce. Served over stir fried rice noodles with black soy sauce), and the flavor was just right and made my daily intake of veggies go down easy.\n-Desserts: SKIP THE DESSERTS.\n\nSeriously, SKIP THE DESSERTS!\nI was looking forward to my Khao-Nuea Sunka-Ya (steamed sweet sticky rice with coconut milk topped with Thai egg custard) and Glua Hom Sa-Bai (fried banana crepe) because they sounded really good in descriptions and I usually have good experiences with Thai desserts.\n\nHowever, I was super disappointed when my dessert plates came up.  I felt like a kid who was expecting a giant/delicious black forest cake but got a tiny gross muffin instead.\n\nThe fried banana crepe was literally just banana in egg roll wrap with some honey on top, nothing special at all.\n\nThe steamed sweet sticky rice dish was sweet in a disgusting way, and the egg custard on the side looked like a pile of poo and tasted like play-do.\n\n\nService:\n-Nice people, but also VERY SLOW people.  Our server was also a bit forgetful and forgot about the chicken dumplings we ordered so now we'll never know what they taste like since we don't plan on going back again.",

Said intruders aren't just here to steal, they're here to be assholes. They steal vessel sinks on the top floor and let that running water run, run, run throughout the walls, down to the first floor onto those precious wood floors that were installed just a few days before. \n\nWhat do you do?\nWell, you can start with thanking God that Kate Fry is on your side.\n\nI ended up backing out of the deal and purchasing a different home but that's not what this review is about. This review is about the force that is Kate Fry with Everhart Studio Real Estate. This was all such a learning process for me and thanks to her, I was able to have it all broken down in Layman's terms for easier digestion. Kate and I hit it off and I think that's due in large part to her no-nonsense tactics that for a lack of better terms \"get shit done\" in a professional and prompt manner. I know I was definitely on the bottom of her totem pole as far as dinero to spend goes, but she never treated me any differently for it. She even took the time to meet with me in person to go through the mortgage documents step by step.\n\nKate is especially knowledgeable in the downtown and historical home markets. Which, fortunately for me, my final home purchase fell into both categories. \n\nConsider this my second \"thank you\" note if you see this, Kate!",

  "text": "The Pros.\n\nThe restaurant decor & overall eye appeal was\nbeautiful.  Table settings with flowers in a vase, glass water decanters & mason jars to drink out of.  The view from the 2nd floor looking down on both the kitchen & the busy street corner was great for former cook slash tourist enjoying that beautiful spring day.  \n\nI was easy amused by the menu for the colas, as \nBaileys offers a large variety of locally made beverages.  We ordered the Million Dollar Orange made with real cane sugar from just across the river in Illinois. We also tried a cold one from Fitz's root beer bottled in St. Louis (my favorite this meal) & and a cold long time Classic Coke a in a bottle from Mexico.\n\nThe food was fun, and tasted as good as it looked.  \nThey have a wide variety of unique toppings paired with different ingredients making for some great burger combinations.  The toppings range from guacamole to Camembert cheese. They offer pretzel & gluten free buns.  A few things that peeked my taste bud's intrest were Fontina cheese, the pablano sour cream, the tomato jam and a few other ingredients.   \n\nI like the option to build your own burger or substitute pork, chicken, bison, lamb or a veggie burger instead of beef on your burger.  I was kinda surprised they didn't have a turkey burger option though. House made ketchup, nice touch\n\nService was great. Our server was very helpful & I love it when a server is knowledgeable of the menu.  Last but not least.... the house made pickles were addictive. Zesty pickles with a little bit of heat, definitely one of a kind.  My taste buds will hold that memory tight for years \n\nThe cons\n\nThe burgers were a little small for 8-10 dollars.  Which is fine, I enjoyed every bite. We were so full and hopped up on all the sugar from the pop we didn't have any room to explore the shake menu.\n\nWe really enjoyed our lunch at Baileys and we all agreed that if we lived in town this would not have been our only visit.  We were so into the burger battle my son & I decided to have our own. I got the Carolina with pulled pork, coleslaw and BBQ sauce.  He got the ABC Burger with roasted (A)pples, (B)acon & (C)amembert cheese.  So be sure to check out my photos & vote for your favorite.",

  "text": "If you love the casino life, you will probably love the Peppermill. I am not a fan by any stretch, so for me, everything looks gaudy and over-designed and looks like it would've been luxurious in the 80s, but not in 2016. Or like the designer is Donald Trump's interior designer. I'm in the Tuscany Tower. When the furniture is lush, the walls (not wallpaper, not paint, but texturized walls) AND fixtures, AND bedding, AND lamps, AND everything in eyesight does not need to be lush, too. Too too much, and not at all contemporary. I get that the theme is Italy. I've been to Italy. It doesn't look like this.\n\nThe casino furniture also looks like it hasn't been updated since the 80s. That said, nothing is in disrepair. Everything is functional. When I got to my room, I was actually about to call down to the front desk to see if I was in the right room, because I have two TVs (one in the bathroom), two sinks in the bathroom, two shower heads in the shower, and a jacuzzi tub for two. Apparently, all rooms are similar. Some others on this trip with me noted that they have a jacuzzi SPA that could accommodate four in the MIDDLE of their room. This is very 80s, Peppermill! No one thinks that's cool anymore. Well, no one outside of the casino life and under 50, anyway.\n\nI was surprised that the rooms didn't come with refrigerator or microwave. It's a resort, so I understand that they make their money on incidentals. So they have a mini fridge and snack bar in each room to keep you from bringing in your own stuff. Further, as a resort, all of the restaurants are grossly overpriced. Again, you're paying for the convenience of having everything right here. And it seems a lot of the food is the same regardless of where you're eating, especially the desserts.\n\nOnce my eyes recovered from bleeding and my wallet stopped screaming, I can say that the Peppermill is very accommodating. The fitness center is more than adequate, complete with numerous treadmills, elliptical trainers, free weights, weight machines, a studio for calisthenics, a steam room... and they give free bottled water.\n\nAll of the staff is super nice and accommodating from front desk to housekeeping to the many restaurants. They understand service.\n\nIf you want to get married, they even have two wedding chapels here. Gotta love Nevada.",

  "text": "Franco's Tomato Pies on Main Street, Yardley, PA, has been around for a long while doing mostly take out pizzas from their small shop right next door to Bagel Train. There are only two booths in house, so they don't get much dine in business. Still, I was there around 2:30 in the afternoon earlier this week, and wanted carbs to help finish my long day into night schedule. \n\nI asked if I could eat there, and they were totally accommodating. I ordered penne aglio olio with sautéed spinach in a lunch portion, and they knew what to do. After about 5 minutes I was called to the counter to pick up a side salad and bread basket. The greens were plentiful, with tomato wedges, iceberg, red onion, cukes and sliced carrots. Actually, took me by surprise. The four slices of Italian loaf were fresh and ready for dipping into balsamic vinaigrette and the garlicy broth to come at the bottom of the pasta bowl. \n\nA few minutes later, the white soup bowl of pasta was on the counter calling my name. I walked over to get it, and enjoyed the hot garlic breath of the dish wafting into my face. Smelled so good. The taste was about right, too. Plenty of pencil points under a nice load of soft spinach. The garlic could have been more golden, but no biggie.\n\nThe only difficulty I confronted was the large pond of garlic water under the pasta. No matter how long I waited to allow the water to drain from each forkful, it was still dripping onto my shirt, pants and tie. I was careful, but all will be visiting the cleaners to get the stains out. My bad for not bringing a long bib. \n\nThe store needed a strong cleaning, too. The floor looked grimy from lack of care, and the kitchen area visible from the counter failed the visual inspection test. Looks like the boss doesn't stop in often enough.",

I also love that I can enjoy their beer outside on the patio on a nice day, with some tasty food. \n\nWe visited on a Saturday after the lunch rush, and we were able to get a table outdoors with an umbrella. They have several tables for outdoor seating, but they also have indoor seating if that's what you want. They require masks be worn indoors (and outdoors when you're not eating). When we visited, it was a nice day and they had the doors open, so there was a lot of fresh air circulating indoors.\n\nMostly the food here is burgers and fries, and we ordered the Chi-Town Loaded Frittes, which was a big basket of fries topped with shaved roast beef, beer cheese, horseradish sauce, and bits of carrots and celery. At first, I was puzzled as to why they included the carrots and celery, but as I ate, I came to the conclusion that they were going with a theme here: roast beef and vegetables! It was like a pot roast dinner on top of fries. That's actually pretty clever. \n\nSo we split the loaded fries because they were a lot of food, and we also got salads: the Daredevil Chop (a chopped salad) and the Wedge Romaine. Be aware that the wedge is made of romaine lettuce, not iceberg! It's a different take on the classic.\n\nThe beer here is killer, but they also have several ciders to choose from, as well as wine by the glass and by the bottle.\n\nAnd lastly but not leastly: They serve their water with rabbit turd ice! That crunchy, pellet-like ice that is the best ice.",

On coincidence, we stayed late enough (about half an hour in) for them to start changing from brunch to LUNCH! It was two meals for the price of one, and a cheaper on at that. LOL, so if you're feeling lunch food but lost enough at the tables and slots and trying to get a good deal, that's one way to hit up this buffet. I wasn't even trying to do it on purpose, but it just happened. \n\nThe waitress was such a troll. I was so used to that Vegas buffet, so no matter the time or the day for an extra little bit, we get unlimited mimosas, but NAH. It doesn't work like that here in Reno, CA. It's only on Sundays and you pay a hefty price for it, so I stuck with OJ instead. \n\nThe food at The Buffet was decent. Lots of bread choices, the omlet station closes really early, and chorizo with cheesy potatoes are the win. They have your classic make your salads, fruits, sausage and polish kelbias, amongst a bunch of other varieties that I can't name off the top of my head. But as for breakfast, it's an extensive combination. When lunch rolled along, you had your chinese and your mexican choices and some other american choices. It was a pretty decent amount of food difference for each meal, it wasn't like they kept what they had out for breakfast the same thing for lunch. \n\nThen comes the gelato station- which didn't taste like gelato. Melted, slighty frozen yogurt, but the portions were huge and not your typical flavors. There's also giant marble pound cake- which was dry and different pies on display.",

  "text": "I do most of my shopping at Costco, but occasionally I go to Kmart for that one thing, and every single time I leave feeling exasperated.  It is not at all surprising that Sears/Kmart are in big trouble financially.  The shopping center is confusing and could really use a few stop signs here and there to improve traffic flows and safety.  The store is disorganized and not well lit.  You often find an item with no price tag anywhere.  Was it suppose to be here or was this lonely object randomly placed here by employees or shoppers?  Who knows?  There are a lot of stuff on shelves/racks in the middle of the aisles. There is no logic in how the items are organized.   Its like a thrift shop, the dollar store, or a garage sale.   The lines are long and the cashiers move like molasses.  Just think of the efficiency you see at Costco, and now picture the exact opposite happening at Kmart.  \n\nThe so call shop your way reward system is just more trouble than it is worth.  If you have credit in the account, It is not automatically credited toward your purchase.  You have to ask everytime and you have to input a pin number just to use it.  Anyone remember that?  I don't think so since no sane individual would regularly subject herself to the Kmart shopping experience.  \n\nOnce, I even had a cashier who specifically ask me if I want to know how much is in my rewards account.  She then looked it up and told me the number, something like 15 cents.  When I looked at my receipt later, the credit was not applied to my purchase.  Well, why the hell did you go through all that trouble if it is not going toward my purchase?  Oh yeah, she would need the stupid pin number to use it.  Along with the question of \"would you like me to see how much is in your account?\", this particularly friendly cashier also had a repertoire of other questionnaires.  \"Would you like the receipt printed or emailed?\", \"Would you like just the receipt or the receipt with all the coupons?\", \"Would you like to donate to St. Jude?\", \"Would you like to apply for a credit card?\", \"Would you like this in a bag?\"...Gahh, maybe that's why the line moves like molasses.",

  "text": "For dimsum outside of Center City's Chinatown...AWESOME!\n\nThis is closer to my house then driving to center city, and I truly can appreciate that. It seats a decent amount of people (~50) and although I've only gone on weekends at lunch time, the place is pretty packed all the time. The patrons are mainly chinese, and you'll hear the chinese chatter around you all the time mixed with some english. The servers pushing the dim sum cart speak limited english but there is always the art of pointing or calling over the owner/manager who speaks english well. \n\nThis is the type of establishment that only gives you tea, and water upon request. Service is fast and efficient, and the food served is hot and fresh. The dimsum they have is an OK selection, I've been to ones that have worse and better, but for what they do serve, I believe the quality is pretty good, esp since this strip of asian businesses is located in a unusual place in northeast philly. \n\nThe parking is always kinda rough, but I've never had to look for more than 10 mins before something popped up. Other than that, the standard noodle dishes are traditional and not fakey american. I love dry (no gravy) chicken chow fun. They do a good job here on the noodles in general, probably have tried 5 different varieties and never been disappointed.\n\nDef somewhere to check out if you live nearby and dont like going to the city for some authentic chinese food/dim sum. It's cured some of my homecooked cravings from my childhood while living away from home, so I will continue to be a patron.",

  "text": "Penang is a Malaysian place in Chinatown, and part of a chain.\n\nThe decor was unusual, there were metal fixtures in the ceiling serving a purely ornamental function. The restaurant was divided into two sections, a ground floor and slightly elevated platform. I had a window seat with a lovely view (of the street - this is Philadelphia, after all).\n\nService (Ha) was attentive, they came by to check to see if we had ordered and filled our water glasses repeatedly. The wait staff was ever-present, delivered food quickly, didn't mind taking pictures, and even walked over when I gave a thumbs-up sign (which was surprising).\n\nThe penang poh piah (steamed Malaysian spring roll stuffed with jicama, fried tofu, eggs and bean sprouts) was light and sweet. The Mee Siam (stir-fried rice noodles with tofu, shrimp and bean sporuts in a tangy sweet (they say \"spicy\") Thai chili sauce, sprinkled with ground peanuts and sliced hard boiled eggs on the side) was fine, too. Not terribly expensive, and credit cards are accepted now (minimum purchase of $12).\n\nNoise level was acceptable, though I had to strain somewhat to hear my fellow diner (she's soft-spoken, so that didn't help). Worth a visit if you've never been.\n\nUPDATE: February 22, 2008 - went here with a large, raucous party - food was delicious - management and service was patient with our group, considering how drunkenly rowdy many of our group was... also, the interior has changed since the last time I was here, and renovations are still happening.",

This eatery offers a bright and colorful space, modest, but with room to spare.\n\nTheir menu's full of affordable entrees, including noodles, fried rice, and curries, all in shareable portions. Flat rice noodles (kweitaw goreng; N8 on the menu) are pan-fried yet moist, made even more flavorful by mixing in red chilies from the condiment rack. The Medan-style chicken soup (R15) is soothing, sporting a curry-like coconut broth, plus a side of shrimp crackers and sweet sauce. For best results, pair the soup with a plate of house-style fried rice (R3; nasi goreng), served with an egg on top.\n\nThanks to low tabs, their cash-only policy isn't much of an issue.",

It's very clean and you don't have people who hog machines at this location. I go in, get my workout done and leave. They have a lot of machines to choose from, and I especially love the circuit machines. You can work out for 39-45 mins and work out your entire body! This location beats any of the locations in Philadelphia.\nLove the fact that I pay only 20 dollars a month and I get to bring a guest with me every time to the gym. I also save on drinks and can buy them for half off compared to the other members who pay 10 dollars a month. I also can utilize the tanning beds and massage chairs as much as I want to. Overall I'm glad I joined planet fitness and I am happy with my results and weight loss since joining.",

As you can imagine the crowd was mostly toddlers, moms, and a few dad's here and there. \n\nMy toddler had a great time and I will definitely take her again. As someone has already stated the more people you bring the more fun you will have. We made the best of it but next time will definitely bring along some people. \n\nTo describe the experience when  you walk in through the doors and on the left are the registers where you pay. I was instructed to sign the waiver as I hadn't already. There are about 4 or 5 computers to the left of the registers where you do this takes about 5 minutes.  I then paid ($5 per toddler) I received stickers one more me and one for my daughter.Mine said \"pads only\" I was confused until I went to the trampoline area. Also. Paid $1 for each pair of socks but they are reusable. Before heading to trampolines there is a quick orientation on the bleachers to the right of the registers. Lol! My daughter tried jumping but mostly just had fun toddling around. After a little over 30 minutes she was exhausted.\n\nOverall great experience with all of the staff and the venue. I want to come back for their fitness classes. Check out their website for more info!",

Although it was my understanding this year you aren't allowed to bring dogs, but I did see plenty there. So be aware they maybe enforcing that more as summer goes on. Also you are not allowed to bring in any alcohol- they sell it there.   Bring lawn chairs and/or a blanket and stake your area in the very large park.\n\nThere are up to 20 food trucks and small tent vendors that offer BBQ, burgers, schnitzel, bah mi, and desserts.  So one should go home hungry.  I prefer to go right at 5 when it opens to beat the longer lines than form around 6-6:30 and so my favorite spots don't run out of the item I want.\n\nI do wish the organizers would space the trucks out just a little more so the lines don't meld together and the walk way would be more open.  \n\nOver by the train is a small stage set up with a different music act each week.\n\nIt's a nice venue to enjoy various foods and hang out with friends on a Friday night",

I saw a lot of pets here since the Bell Road trailhead off of Stewart's Ferry Pike also has the Stones River Dog Park. There are restrooms (not just port-a-potties!) right by the parking lot. The walkway is paved and starts right at the foot of the J. Percy Priest Dam. The greenway winds under I-40 and once you get away from that noise it becomes very peaceful and nice. I could see the Stones River from the majority of the path which made for nice scenery. The greenway connects to the Shelby Bottoms Greenway, which makes it accessible from different trailheads as well. Although it's not as convenient for me as other greenways in Nashville I still think it's very nice here and if I lived a bit closer I'd be over here often!",

I love the space more than anything because it just has a great ambiance. Service has always been good and I have had good dining experiences. The first dinner I had was fabulous. It was a vegan chickpea curry and the flavors were spot on, paired with a Brussels sprouts dish that was delicious. Since they will rotate their menu items a bit I didn't see the curry on the menu the next time I returned. Second time we got a smoked tuna dip as an appetizer which we both enjoyed. For our entrees my boyfriend got the Korean fried chicken and I got the grilled halibut. He said the chicken was pretty good although he loves spicy so he wanted more of a kick. I thought my entree was tasty paired with the green chimmichuri sauce on top but I wasn't sold on the tomato farro that was underneath the fish. The dishes were all visually appealing but the second visit didn't wow as much. Overall I think this is a nice place and I'd love to come back for a cocktail sometime as well.

I saw all the awesome reviews and I thought (somewhat guiltily) that I should try it out. The bottom line is that the ambiance, food/drinks and staff are all on point here. If feel obliged to give your business to the same regular place I urge you to try something new here!  \n\nThree Brothers Coffee have the same owners as the next door Cumberland Transit, specializing in outdoor apparel/gear. I like supporting places that fuel my love of the outdoors so TBC melds well with that. Looking around the cafe, it is nicely decorated and has a hip/modern vibe with the artwork that is displayed. \n\nI ordered a Golden Axe ($5.25) which is one of their seasonal drinks. I asked the barista if it was better hot or cold and she said she liked it both ways so I got it hot. The Golden Axe is a Vietnamese inspired iced americano, brewed with a coconut-ginger syrup and topped with a coconut sweet cream. It is only slightly sweet but has an usual depth of flavors. Really unique and great drink! \n\nThey have a case with freshly baked goods and when I saw they had goodies from Dozen Bakery I knew I had to get something. I am more of a savory breakfast eater so I got the ham and cheese croissant ($4.50). This was a big croissant and I tried to eat it as slowly as possible to enjoy it but it still disappeared. \n\nA couple of minor weaker areas of this cafe. Prices were too high for my liking. I didn't like spending $9.75 on breakfast when I felt like it was a dollar more expensive for each item than it should be. Parking can be tough if the rear lot is full. There are a few metered spots outside the front as well. \n\nOverall, a quality cafe with many boasting rights. I can imagine this being a treat once in a while for me as I did enjoy it.",

  "text": "Staying in the Gulch and heard this place was good. Home football game today, so of course it's going to be busy. Dropped by around 10:40am on a Sunday and waited in line awhile to check in. When we got to the host stand, we were told 1 hr 15 min wait for a party of 2. We put our name in. The host was very kind and said we could actually text back and forth with him, regarding any questions or changes etc. \nNearby, we grabbed a couple Lime scooters and toured around for an hour. When we came back, we waited a short while and then a text came to say our table was ready. It was 12:00. \nWe stood by the sign that says wait here when your table is ready and we were greeted and seated within seconds. \nOur table was outside; beware the bird crap. It was on the chairs, but it was dried. But that was our sign that birds may be an issue. \nOur server was super nice. He told us some funny dad jokes and made some recommendations. We started with waters, the cold brew and a dirty London fog, which was delicious. The burrata and fig appetizer was large enough to be shared among four people\n They had differing levels of toast on their bread- some very toasted and some minimally toasted. I think this was on purpose and I appreciate it. Some people like crunchier, some like softer! The burrata was a small serving but there was a TON of prosciutto, fig jam and arugula on the plate. I did wish for a little more cheese and blue cheese crumble. Just as we were finishing up, our plate was decorated with fresh bird crap from above. Yuck. Good thing we were pretty much done with that plate. \nFor breakfast, we should have shared. The hodgepodge hash was a huge plate and we added an extra egg. I think it's chicken sausage pieces? But there's a lot going on there and it was hearty and good. The mushroom omelette was full of cheese and mushrooms.  Pretty standard. We did appreciate we could get egg whites for that entree.  We kept an eye on the birds above while we ate, which is bit annoying. I'd like to eat without supervising. Next time I'll wait longer for an indoor table. \nEverything was great with breakfast except two things- we were not asked which side we wanted with the omelette so I guess the default is fruit, which we didn't want, we wanted the potatoes. I wanted a biscuit with a side of gravy, but instead of charging the biscuit and gravy as an added side to the omelette, we were charged the actual biscuit with jam /honey entree plus a side of gravy. Obviously that made more money for the restaurant, but it did not have to be ticketed that way. The biscuit was crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle. The country gravy was thick and delicious. Lots of large pieces of sausage inside. Yum. \nIn the end, I asked for the check and two salted caramels to go. Our server brought the check but forgot the caramels. When prompted, he apologized and brought back two caramels, no charge. So that sorta makes up for the above issues. The caramels are delicious, btw. They're individually wrapped too, so you can take them to go very easily. \nOutside there are no TVs. I'm not sure about inside? So don't bank in catching the game while you eat. Inside, the line for the restroom was LONG. Plan accordingly. \nThey have a little bakery and coffee shop inside, with store merchandise for sale as well. You can place to go orders, which take about 20 min. If you don't wanna wait for a table. \nThere is a parking lot across the street from them, but you gotta pay to park. I'd eat here again, but not on a busy day. I'd prefer to be inside, safe from the bird crap.",

  "text": "I am rating the Hutton Hotel based off of my experiences with them from an event planning perspective.\n\nSometimes, I wonder if it is normal to spend as much time at a hotel that is based out of your own city because I am ALWAYS at the Hutton. I was just involved in a fundraiser event there last weekend, will be there all this week to host some out-of-town co-workers, and am also co-producing another large-scale event there on Thursday evening. Maybe I should just forgo my home in East Nashville and just live in a suite on the 10th floor?\nHow very Chateau Marmont of me.\n\nPart of the reason that event planners such as myself like to host events at the Hutton Hotel is because they are just THAT good. Seriously.\nThe location is central and close to everything. The staff is always friendly and the service is excellent. I also love the chic' interior design and always refer all of my out-of-town guests to book here. \n\nTheir Director Of Events J. Curtis Hinton is very patient and offers up fantastic solutions for your event. You may utilize/book their conference rooms or ballrooms for virtually any size event.\n\nIf you're looking for me this week, you know where to find me!",

  "text": "Such a letdown. I had been wanting to try Undrgrnd for at least a few months now and finally found them last week at the Manayunk StrEAT festival. Unfortunately, since we got to the event late (thanks for that, SEPTA) we also got to the truck late. The line was cut off right in front of us after we had waited for several minutes.\n\nNot giving up, I located their truck at today's Flight Market. Again, since I ate first, the line was quite long. Maybe this is just a thing at food truck festivals? It was the longest line of my day, though. When I [finally] reached the front, I paid my $4, waited some more, and alas, was handed a French Toast and a Captain Cranky.\n\nMy first thought was that they were smaller than anticipated -- especially for that price tag. Still, I was excited, happily shot a photo, and bit into the French Toast.\n\nAaaand all I could taste was grease. I understand they had just come out of the fryer, but... what? It did not taste like French Toast in the slightest bit, which was a bummer.\n\nNext up, the Captain Cranky had a strawberry glaze and captain crunch on it. I told my friend that the topping was the best part. This one was otherwise just as greasy.\n\nI realize they were likely overwhelmed by the number of people wanting their donuts, but I do wish this had been a better experience. If I ever stumble upon them in the city, I'll give them a second try, but I certainly won't go out of my way to wait in a crazy long line for them again.",

It was around $2. They have a decent selection but green was one of my favorites. Their tea is all organic. The infuser is made of silk which isn't necessary and the tea didn't taste like green tea. The next time I went, I decided to try their food. I ordered the sweet and sour crispy chicken with white rice. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and didn't taste too bad, however the price was too much and the food wasn't authentic.\n\nThe atmosphere was great. Everything seemed rather clean.\n\nThe service was ok. The food arrived in a few minutes.\n\nIn short: the food, though unauthentic, was edible. The tea was disappointing. The price was too high.

  "text": "A cool park situated in the Pinelands. I might even be persuaded to go close to 5 stars if not for the fees. The $2 per person beach fee is not bad to be honest, but I'm not sure why there needs to be launch fees and others. Canoe and kayak rental is a plus, but again at higher than normal rates for a small lake. Snack bar was priced as you might have expected too. But really, just pack your own and enjoy the fresh air.\n\nWe walked a part of the free trail that skirts around the lake. Cabins are located here and at $50 a night seem like an inexpensive family overnight trip. These are situated overlooking a smaller body of water, there are grills outside and a small kitchen as well. Showers were available on the swimming beach, not sure if in cabins. I will definitely return this summer for more piney fun.",

I feel like I've done myself a great disservice! \n\nI was incredibly stoked about the flavor selection - there must be about 30 to choose from. I went with a very odd combination of three flavors that do not go together whatsoever but are things I just like individually: cotton candy, pumpkin pie and cookies-n-cream. Super weird, right? I'm sure I'm the first person in Tanya & Matt's history to go with that combo, but I really just tried to eat one at a time and not mix them with each scoop - it worked out! I really loved the cotton candy and the pumpkin pie, especially. The cookies-n-cream was solid too. I also really appreciated that you could order a cone bowl because I wanted to take mine home and a regular cone would have been quite messy and difficult to transport.\n\nMy wife ordered a chocolate covered cherry shake and loved it, despite having low expectations for whatever reason. \n\nWe really dropped the ball by not coming here sooner and will definitely be visiting regularly moving forward!",

Because this is the best lobster in Tampa Bay, and for the best value.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nEver since experiencing the best meal of my life (a hot Lobster Roll at Neptune Oyster in Boston,) I've been on the hunt to duplicate that feeling of ecstasy. This was as close as I've come taste-wise, but it's definitely the best value I've ever seen for lobster. I had so much, I could barely eat it all, and it was under $20. This cannot, and will not ever be beaten.\n\nIt's a laid back vibe, with a decent beer selection, and excellent service. Our server, Megan, was a little ball of energy from the moment we arrived. She was so entertaining, it was like we had dinner and a show, but just for the price of dinner. It was a fun night.\n\nI chatted with the owner afterward, and he said he prides himself on having a more casual restaurant so that he can charge less for the lobster. I'll take a pile of Lobster for $20, over a white tablecloth any day of the week myself.\n\nSo, if Lobster is you thing, there's nowhere else to look in TB.

If there's one thing I love about it, it's that they do offer very limited \"single\" seat options. That is, I can actually go into the auditorium and find a seat where I don't have to sit next to someone else by getting out of my wheelchair. The majority of theaters tend to have companion seating. \n\nThe seats are older and tend to be less comfortable than what you find in most theaters. They aren't horrible, but they definitely aren't plush. Prices tend to be a tad higher here due to tax issues related to the downtown stadiums, but the prices are still on par with most area theaters. \n\nThe staff is friendly, though they can be a bit \"in your face\" at times if they are unfamiliar with you. This is definitely one of my least favorite theaters in Central Indiana, and I can't say I'd recommend it for a film that utilized high special effects. They do offer special film series offerings throughout the year, especially during the Summer months, and despite my reservations I would note that it's still pretty consistently crowded.",

The higher the temperature of the yogurt the heavier it is when it is weighed. Unlike my favorite Yogurtland they have an employee give you samples instead you sampling yourself. The toppings are cut heavy also to boost the price. \n\nOverall the yogurt itself is pretty tasty but the fact that they try to cheat you on the little things to boost the price will keep me from coming back.

Surprised by the interior - if Denny's and a food court's fornication resulted in a baby, it would be First Watch. A baby that looks like all the other babies. You say it's cute because you feel like it's the nice thing to do, when in reality it's just your average bebe.\n12:01 p.m.: seated immediately - but in the depths of the restaurant at a 6-person circular table...for two. (I title this complaint: \"white girl problems\")\n12:15: orders were finally taken (I know, I know. 14 minutes doesn't seem like much but in the world of lunch breaks its the difference between life and death.)\n12:39: food arrives - presented nice-looking meals - I'd give the food four stars. I had the veggie burger with a cup of the tomato basil soup. I was surprised that the veggie burger didn't come with cheese, so I opted for a slice of Swiss. \n12:55ish: Brittany's sloth-like eating habits continue. Decision is made that I will return again and try one of their breakfast options: fun variety of pancake and hash options.\n\nYou know the saying \"bless his/her heart\" and how it's sometimes comes off as more of a \"damn. that poor thing can't seem to get their shit together\" than an actual blessing? Well, bless our waitress' heart - it took three tickets for her to get the order correct and figure out which standard dressings go with which salads - she asked us. The business is still fairly new, so I'm going to go out on a limb and guess she's new to the profession. Nice menu/tasty food, First Watch. Hope you can get the kinks out of the service side of things. As for the DennysFoodCourt Baby that is your interior, well, I have a feeling that won't be changing any time soon.",

An empty stomach having a canipshin because you have been neglecting it far too long. Either that, or the Scooby Snack you had on trail has since wore off. The latter is what happened with me and The Crew. Our morning stroll through the Coronado Monarch Butterfly Preserve and along the beach left our tummy's HANGRY!\n\nThanks for the mighty Yelp app. we found ourselves here. The filters on the app are a god send when having to find eateries extensive enough to accommodate preferences, food allergies, and wallets, Siam Thai met everyone's criteria.\n\nLocated on the main drag in the charming little beach town of Carpenteria, Siam Thai's interior is modest in size but their newly added back patio is grand and a great place to enjoy yummy eats while soaking up some Vitamin D. The interior is decorated with gold colored elephants, statues, and figurines.\n\nWith so many peeps in attendance, I'm not going to list the dishes ordered, however, I will say we ordered a few appetizers, soups, entrees, including curry's, fried rice, noodles, and vegetarian dishes. Entrees, curry's, and, noodles come with a choice of chicken, beef, pork, or tofu, up-charge for shrimp or seafood.  Not only was everyone WOWED! by the friendly staff members ability to take our orders expeditiously, but also deliver each dish quickly and accurately. And let me tell you, some folks order the an item straight from the menu, only to ask to hold this or that, this or that on the side, and substitute this for that. Oy!!! We did not receive one dish incorrectly. Portions were plentiful and all hot dishes were served hot, all cold dishes, served cold, and beverage glasses were kept full. \n\nSTAFF EARNED IT!\nFree public parking lot nearby, as well as, free street parking, as it should be, Siam Thai was such a great find.  Our server was so accommodating, instead of one long arse check, she combined four orders per check. Phew!! That many peeps all on one check can be an accounting nightmare. Server and her staff so deserved the well over 20% tip we left. Great place, ya'll should check it out. Hopefully, you will have the same experience me and The Crew did.",

  "text": "The Rules of having a Great Experience at the Well:\n\n1. Arrive Early\n2. Go on Pint Nights where pints are $2.75 or Fridays for Bluegrass\n3. Order Domaine Dupage or Loose Cannon IPA.\n4. Order homemade walnut bread with Humboldt Fog chevre.\n\nI mean, really, you must follow these rules. They're very specific...because any sort of wavering will deter you from returning. That is of course if: you don't like smokey tiny rooms the size of your walk-in closet that are too-loud and stuffy. \n\nShowing up at opening on a weeknight...yeah..go ahead...accept your existence of being a yuppie who likes to go places other than your balcony. It's okay...really...you like to drink beer. There's nothing wrong with it. \n\nThe wait staff here is just...plain...kind. They answer your inquiries about what song is playing. They just like you. Really...people like you. I promise. \n\nPlus, they won't make you feel bed for ordering the good beer (ahem...local brewpub who can't stand it when you order beers that aren't their own...). In fact, they love you for it. And, I love you Wellington for having Domaine Dupage on tap.  You're not going to find better beer on tap for that price anywhere in the city. Everywhere else it's either $2 domestics or $5-6 micros. Cheers to this anomaly!\n\nThe new bar food menu is refreshing to see. Cheeses, meats, soups, salads. A bit too decadent maybe for Broad Ripple? Ahhhhh patooey...call it \"chevre,\" simply out of spite of what's down the block! \n\nIf you're running late and you show up at 6, be prepared for smoke -- a lot of it. And somehow the Wellington convinces me I like to watch folks play darts. \n\nThen, on Fridays in the basement the bluegrass...the coziest party in Broad Ripple. Just arrive early to get a table...if not you'll be that casual couple that thought they just could pop in, walk down stairs to find 50 people stomping, clapping and quaffing, and you're left only to retreat to the same ole, same ole.\n\nIf only we could convince them to open the basement on pint nights for those not inclined to smoke....\n\nO, and don't be alarmed there's a security camera in the joint...it's gotta be for these amazing tables that seem like they're right out of a Victorian mansion. Good form!",

But aside from that serendipitous moment, I like the layout of LEX with their pool, multiple bars, and spacious walkways. Nothing about a club annoys me more than narrow walkways/chokepoints that just make it harder to get around and gives you some claustrophobia. Maybe just because it's Reno or the Saturday I went wasn't the busiest, but I liked how it wasn't so crowded, yet there was still a good group of friendly folks! It was easy to get a drink (not a 10-minute wait) and the prices don't break your wallet. Since I met someone so awesome here, this is the best club in Reno! I guess also I haven't really been to any other club in Reno unless you count Brews Brothers. So if you find yourself at the GSR on a weekend, LEX has a high potential to be super fun with great music and a chill atmosphere.",

  "text": "So it's the day of NYE and just about every restaurant in the French Quarter has a line of 20 people out the door. Lucky for us, we came across Desire at just the right hour because we were immediately seated - almost window-side - in a packed house. \n\nWith 127 reviews and counting, let me break it down for you...\n\nStart with oystas! The raw oysters were incredibly fresh, chilled, and served with plenty of lemon. And they their house-made cocktail sauce has strong bite - or should I say a giant smack? ...because that was spice-ay! \n\nWe also got the barbecue oysters. They're fried, glazed in a wonderfully sweet and smokey barbecue sauce, sitting over individual shells and topped with crumbled bleu cheese. I didn't snap any pics, but you gotta check out this photo snapped by another yelper... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JvawJ9bSr22xn4R9oLvl_w?select=VL23qeOnZHumSnISqQ0uXw\n\nYou can't get wrong with the gumbo, with its rich, thick roux. Probably the best I've had in a while. I also ordered the crawfish ettoufee. it was good, but I had plate envy for my friend's shrimp and grits. \n\nThe bloody mary I ordered was alright. Not the best. It was a tad too thick and had the consistency of ketchup. The flavor and spiciness were there, but I should have ordered another shot of Tito's and thrown in some more Worcestershire to thin it out. \n\nService was great. I appreciate how it was so busy, and yet our server kept reminding us to \"take our time\" and \"enjoy your food.\" Love the Big Easy mentality. \n\nI'll totes come back. But probably stick with a dozen or two oysters and a nice cold beer.",

So when one of my co-workers way back when asked if I would like to join her and another co-worker here for dinner on her gift card, I jumped at the chance to finally walk through that door. \n\nThe three of us managed to grab a nice leather banquette and I'm pretty sure everyone surrounding us was male, in suits, settling in after a long day of work. I'm happy to say we were doing the same, and it felt good. \n\nEven better, a friend was our server for the evening, and she made sure we were well taken care of. One of us ordered Steak Diane, a filet mignon, and yes, I had chicken. We split three sides and pretty much demolished everything in sight, if not daintily. I do believe we ordered that hot chocolate molten lava cake (I can't even get the name correct but we enjoyed this) and we sat back and relaxed after we feasted. \n\nDamn, I miss the days when I made good money, even though this was on a gift card. \n\n*I should point out the time line for this visit was 2004-5 or so when I know these places existed.",

I know the place is new and a lot of training is going on but my growler was not filled to 64 oz. line.  Most places fill it beyond that level to remove the air which is a beer killer.

They were super busy when we went on a Monday night around 6:30pm, and it was about an hour wait for a party of 5. I would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time. We tried:\n\n-Poached Pear Salad (Port Wine Poached Pears, Dried Cranberries, Bleu Cheese, Port Wine Vinaigrette, $12, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_7ncMPpgmjbz9HnraegzsA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok for me, but I'm not a big fan of fruit in my salad or bleu cheese. The salad was really fresh, but I could've done without this- skip!\n-Bacon Wrapped Shrimp & Grits ($30, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BFBoC5nym8ckY-ef3aqm9A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the bacon wrapped shrimp were delicious (and the shrimp were gigantic), and the grits were nice and creamy. Recommended!\n-Mr. B's Barbequed Shrimp ($31, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=19JMuCqrQSLLd8hXf9_X2Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This is THE dish to order here, but only if you're ok with getting down and dirty with your dinner. The shrimps come in the shell and with the head on, and you're going to have to peel away. They do give you a bib and extra napkins, and this dish is definitely worth the extra work! The sauce was amazing, and the shrimp were all really fresh. Make sure you use the garlic bread to soak up all that delicious sauce!\n-Lemon Ice Box Pie ($9, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vnFhuYVRHUjwJdOok1f22w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not what I was expecting. I thought this was a pie made with lemon wafers, but we received an actual slice of pie that resembled key lime. The lemon flavor was very prominent and fresh, and I would recommend ordering this if you want a tart dessert.\n-Profiteroles & Chocolate Sauce ($9, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rQROo8t_KIPWrbJLA9Hhkg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- it's hard to go wrong with cream puffs filled with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with hot fudge. The fudge sauce was amazing, and I could've just had a scoop of vanilla ice cream with the fudge.\n\nThe servers here all have that Southern charm, and were very helpful and attentive. I would definitely come back here for their BBQ shrimp if back in New Orleans, and will also make sure to order their pork belly appetizer!",

Now I basically buy everything online or at Target. I literally had no idea JC Penney was still in business. \n\nThen the holidays rolled around and someone gave me a JC Penney gift card, so JC Penney wound up on my radar.  I Googled it and found out that yes, they are still in business after exiting bankruptcy. Anyway, that prompted me to go in store to check out the merchandise and use my gift card. \n\nMy first impression was that the store looked a bit dated and generic, like a TJ Maxx and Kohl's mash up that was stuck in the 90s. Their merchandise is wildly overpriced. Like $20 for a generic kids t-shirt (vs $6 in Target) and $69 for kids sneakers that I saw on Amazon for half that price. \n\nI ultimately blew my gift card on some luggage, but a quick price check online showed that it was also overpriced, just like the shirts and shoes. Oh well. I figured it was better to use the card ASAP in case they file for bankruptcy again. \n\nThree stars. They're hanging in there it seems, but just barely. I hope they make it.",

  "text": "Returned to Aldo's for dinner for the first time in more than a decade. At one time it had been a regular stop in my rotation when I lived right across Buck Road in Holland, PA. It was good to be back. \n\nThe menu offered a broad swatch of Italian cuisine, mostly of the red sauce variety, but with enough variation to keep it interesting. We went with the Calamari appetizer, and entrees of Veal Parmesan and Chicken Francais, both with sides of pasta, minestrone soup and side salad. We were quite happy with our meals. \n\nThey started off on an off note with a luke warm minestrone that had not been sufficiently reheated, nor tested. The early salad was satisfactory, if less than imaginative. Things improved from there. The Calamari was perfectly prepared with tender squid wrapped in a tasty bread crumb dredge and a thick marinara dipping sauce. The veal was delicious with two thin filets, breaded and pan fried in extra virgin just right to maximize its delicate texture and finished with melted mozza and more chunky red gravy. The three Francaised chicken breast medallions were pan sauteed in butter, lemon and white wine. They were fork cuttable and the interplay of the lemon and wine played tartly and smartly on the tongue. We used the crusty bread to sop up as much of the reduction as possible. My request for the pasta side bowl to be penne aglio olio rather than more tomato sauce was a good call because I loved the well browned garlic and black pepper mix. \n\nAldo still does a solid traditional Italian American dinner in an attractive dining room. It was nice to know that for the most part they hadn't lost their touch.",

You'll get it all here. \n\nI walked in to listen to the band and ended up sitting at the bar and drinking local beers while admiring the enthusiasm the crowd had for some good music. there were more boots and cowboy hats in here than any other bar on the strip, if that tells you anything. They have an upstairs, too, but the long back bar is all you need to make your own good time. \n\nI would easily recommend Layla's to anyone trying out Nashville and looking for a classic experience.

I get it that it's a new location and maybe have to work out some kinks to get that perfect 5 star ratings? was it the beignets themselves? the service? \n\nFor me, I was just happy that I was able to try their beignets since the more popular historic open-air coffee shop (located on Decatur Street in the heart of the French Quarter) was always crowded with a long wait. Their menu included beignets, coffee and a variety of other drinks. I was second in line from their take-out window (which was nice since we didn't have a lot of time)... ordered a couple of frozen mochas and one order of beignets (came with 3 pieces) that hubby and I shared and it was delicious, not overly sweet! I have nothing to compare it to as far as other beignet shops but I've heard that you have to eat these delicious fluffy desserts fast while it's still hot otherwise they become really hard as a rock so I slowly scarfed it down -LoL- and I enjoyed it very much! Yummy deep-fried pastries that are very similar to doughnuts but not really.\n\nEating beignets at Cafe Du Monde was one of the top suggestions from my friends for things to do in NOLA (thank you, Yelp friends!) and I'm glad I was able to fit it in our two days in New Orleans. Hope to return next year and hit up the one at the French Quarter. Oh yah, I bought a box of beignet mix to take home and I'm going to try to recreate their famous treats!

  "text": "Those who say the best Italian in STL is on, \"The Hill\" is totally wrong. This place in Clayton is amazingly delicious. It is tucked away at the  back-end of a small strip center just off Wydown. The small boutique size makes it intimate and almost romantic. \n\nI meet up with fellow Yelper, Christal for lunch on the Tuesday after Labor Day. Our luncheon was 12:30pm, towards the end of their lunch rush. I arrived first and selected a table on their small patio. Being a dog dad, it was nice to see they had water bowls making the patio pet friendly. \n\nWe started out with some Cauliflower Hummus. In addition to the crostini, they offered a basket of soft Italian bread dabbed with garlic butter. This worked out great, because I preferred the crostini and Christal wanted the softer bread. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the cauliflower hummus. In addition to the hummus, the plate had a small spinach salad with pine nuts and balsamic dressing. It was a nice touch. \n\nFor my entree, I channeled my inner child and ordered a half order of spaghetti and meatball. I choose the chicken.The ground chicken was blended with breadcrumbs. It was moist and tender. Noodles were prepared to a perfect al dente. I don't think Italian food can really be classified as a comfort food, but this Southern Italian Southern food, brought me comfort this afternoon. \n\nNo booze for me, I enjoyed a tall refreshing glass of ice tea. Christal was having a rough day at work and enjoyed a glass of red wine. I found it odd that it was not served in a traditional wine glass. It was served in a small juice/water glass. I thought it was perhaps because we were on the patio.  Then the table next to us ordered a bottle and did have a traditional steamed glass. Just weird. \n\nOur server was professional and very knowledgeable. He described their food and recommended wines for Christal like a true pro. \n\nWill I return? - Most definitely. \n\nWhen: September 5, 2017\nWhy: Italian lunch with a friend",

It does what it does and it does it well. \n\nI ordered up a News 11 concrete which had their Scotch Oatmeal cookie and Reese's peanut butter cups blended in. My brother got the Apple Pie concrete which was delicious and my grandma got an apple cobbler drenched in caramel and custard. My grandpa went with his favorite dessert- a banana split and although it was huge, I'm pretty sure his empty container suggests it was tasty! \n\nWe got here right when it opened and got our dessert right away to enjoy on the benches. It'd be nice if they had some tables set up but the absence kind of adds to the novelty of the place. Like many others, this will definitely be a go-to whenever I am back in St. Louis.",

  "text": "Oh my Gosh, this is one of THE best meals that I have ever eaten at a restaurant, and I have returned over and over again to savor the moment.\n\nMr. B's Bistro is located on Royal Street at Iberville, and it is another member of the famed Brennan family's fine dining establishments. This is a very classic white tablecloth, tuxedoed waiter type of restaurants, but amazingly it is not stuffy or pretentious.\n\nOnce you arrive at your table, the waiter appears with a loaf of freshly-baked bread and lightly-salted butter as he takes your drink order.\n\nHaving been at Mr. B's many times in the past I went straight for my favorite things on the menu. To start I had Mr. B's Crabcake, which was a pan-sauteed jumbo lump crabcake served with their classic ravigote sauce. The crabcake was mostly big chunks of lump crabmeat with very little breading or filler. Following that I had their incredible seafood gumbo which was a classic New Orleans gumbo with Gulf shrimp, crabmeat, oysters, and okra served in a dark roux sauce.\n\nAnd now for my entree (pardon me while I wipe the drool off my mouth).... I ordered the legendary Mr. B's Barbequed Shrimp which is their signature dish. Head-on Gulf shrimp barbequed New Orleans style, served in the shells with Worcestershire-spiked peppery butter sauce and French bread for dipping. The recipe for this amazing dish can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_shrimp.php\n\nTo finish this amazing meal, my lovely friend and I split an order of the Brennan family's Creole Bread Pudding. The recipe is rich in eggs, cream and butter, served warm with Irish whiskey sauce. Oh, and THAT recipe can be found here:  http://www.mrbsbistro.com/recipes_breadpudding.php.\n\nSeriously, one of the best meals on the planet!",

The burgers LOOK small, but halfway through, I just couldn't finish it, I was so full. The ice cream is really good! One scoop was pretty big! So if you're already full, just get one scoop!

Although the majority of their stuff is Chinese, they do carry enough Japanese and Korean food too, especially their candies and condiments.  The price is not the cheapest but definitely not overpriced.  \n\nThey carry fresh seafood (they literally grab live one from the tanks and kill it with a hammer right in front of you....It was brutal and I got traumatized lol).  They also have meat, and the majority are not regular types of meat you see at Publix.  They have intestines, stomach, chicken feet, pig feet, pig ears, and uterus.  I gagged when I was looking at those so if these are not the things you are looking for, stay away.  If you are interested in something you can't get from regular supermarkets, then go for it!  \n\nThey also have bread from Fortune Star Bakery all the way in the back of the building, along with some fresh produce and instant food like ramen noodles.  This place is definitely one-up on Oceanic Oriental in downtown Tampa.",

I ran into a couple of people I haven't seen in a long time (I think I used an alias with one, so the re-introduction moment was awkward), so that was amusing. One of my friends was really drunk and acting silly, so the entertainment factor was high. \n\nBut uhh, then there were some other things that weren't so fantastic. Like the broken glass on the floor (which lodged itself into two different feet of our party). Or the menacing looks from some of the booth-dwellers.

  "text": "When I walked by this place once I read, \"fish in a bag,\" on their sandwich board; that's not going to draw me...if it draws you...please let me know who you are, and what you are. Nor does it jive with the 90210 (the show) feel. It looks like a place that asked themselves, \"would Kelly & Dylan dine here?\"\n\nFinally the cocktail of life shook just the right way to get me here...jet lagged, late Friday night dinner, and this place's \"jerk chicken,\" got me in the door. \n\nThe environment is vastly more comfortable than expected -- space in Broadripple is limited & they don't mind putting in half the amount of tables they could...plenty of elbow room. \n\nNow...that patio is another story...seems stuffy like a twice-baked potato out there. \n\nThe service was as dry as the chicken. The server was just all business...I don't know...it's around 9pm on a Friday...you'd think the service would be, if not steady, just in good spirits...instead he was all business. Granted, being all business has its benefits of taking care of it all, but it was just boring -- compared to the lively atmosphere. \n\nThe server's values are murky: he offered us oil & hot sauce plate amazingness with our pita/hummus, and I made sure it was at no cost, then he brought out more pita and it was eventually charged on the bill (though I had to ask to not include it; sure, call me Stickler). \n\nThe jerk chicken was a husky, dry, giant steak. To me, Jamaica-traveled, should be on the bone, and far from dry. This was Hoosier-ized with sides of beans & carrots & potatoes that no one would eat. It's these veggies that give kids reasons to never eat a healthy diet.\n\nNow...having said this...the place really is a beautiful balance of liveliness and romance for dinner; and that's hard to find. \n\nI'd be back to this place, around the same time too (bordering late night bar crowd) to keep it casual. However, I'd make sure I don't have the same server, because well he reeks of midday workday all-business attitude, and that frustrates a Friday night diner.\n\nAnd, go late to see the Dylan McKay wannabes -- it's funny -- when they know their infinitely, always Brandon Walsh that may as well be showing up with Brenda.",

  "text": "This is a review of the Knitting Factory as a venue for live theater, which I didn't know they were capable of doing until a week ago! It's great to see them really expanding the type of entertainment they're offering. \n\nHere goes...\n\nWhen I saw Avenue Q was going to be playing in Reno, I was giddy with excitement about an opportunity to see a live musical performance here in Reno. Then I realized it was at the Knitting Factory, a black box type venue known more for hosting music more than any other type of performance art, and I was all of a sudden hesitant. I had no fear the actors would put on a great show, but I wasn't sure if the venue could keep up with them. \n\nThree cheers to the Knit for setting up seats with great viewing angles of the stage. There wasn't a bad seat in the house, and we were just about front and center. I loved the show and my time watching it, but as I've experienced here in the past, the sound leaves a little to be desired. There were many times when it was hard to hear the voices of the actors on stage over the music, and I don't know if that's a sound board error or an acoustics issue. Either way, I found myself leaning over to my fiancee, like an old man losing his hearing, asking her what they'd just said. Sometimes she knew, and sometimes we both guessed until we figured it out through context. \n\nWhile the guessing game and acoustic challenges were annoying, I'd say my experience at the Knit was A-OK and I would not hesitate to see another live theater performance there again. I'm glad they're bringing a variety of acts to the venue, and I look forward to what comes next.",

  "text": "I've been wanting to try VV for several months, I finally had the opportunity to do so and I know I'll return. The things I loved about it were as follows:\n\nAmazing customer service by Jill. She had some help running food out but she was the most knowledgeable about the restaurant. She gave very good wine recommendations and knew this current  list. She seemed to be passionate about this place and her role in it. \n\nI loved the modern industrial feel with lots of open space, and the uncluttered display of bottles to go. While the bar is not large, it seemed to be a popular place for locals to meet up after work. And with options to taste up to 40 different curated wines before deciding on which to further enjoy, I'd be a regular here for sure. \n\nI love the business model too. Where else can you sample this many distinct wines to aid in the decision to bring some home? Even restaurants that have vast cellars keep the wine by the glass list relatively short. Then if you did find something you loved you'd have to find it on your own. I found the prices to go to be pretty moderate, I think some bottles were under $15 and with the highest one being just shy of $100. I kind of regret not tasting that one;) \n\nI'm sorry to say I did not love the food, nor did my dining companion. It wasn't bad, but just not up to the standards of the wine I tasted. I think we enjoyed the fig flatbread the most.( half price during happy hour or if on Yelp, half off with check in) Jill also recommended the chicken one but we ordered other items. The poutine was decent, long fries which were very crisp in a tasty brown gravy, maybe too much gravy to fry ratio. Nice size serving for the price too, I took half of it home. The salad was plated beautifully and the beets themselves were perfectly cooked. It was also the most generous amount of burata I've ever seen on a restaurant plate. But the overdressed greens kept this from being great. The mussel small plate was a good size entree for smaller appetites, but broth was very salty. The lager base was ok, but had the broth been tastier, more would have been needed. The shellfish itself seemed a bit dry from lack of broth, and not the plumpest or tastiest we've had. I had the skirt steak main, the meat was done to a perfect medium, nice, and even in this cut was still pretty tender. But the onions were not really caramelized as they had been for flatbread, the broc rabe was very good, just slightly charred but only 3 twigs. The rice was ok. To me the dish was competent in components, but they did not really enhance each other. Lastly the chocolate cheesecake was just ok. The homemade whipped cream helped a little, but I'd pass on this unless you like less dense versions of this dessert. Of everything we tried, I'd probably only reorder the flatbread or poutine. \n\nI think the wine tasting part of this experience is 5 stars. I tried 10 wines in total, half of which I'd consider full pours of if not a to go bottle. For the whites my fav was the Chablis(sadly this was not available to go) but I also enjoyed trying the NY Chard and pitting it against a twice as exp Napa one. For the reds my clear winner was a Portuguese blend that I almost purchased, a reserve from 2013. Second place was a Cab Franc, recommended by Jill. \n\nA return trip will be focused mainly on the wines, and I plan on checking their website to see as new things are added. I'm not giving up on the food here though, but will likely not try to make it into a meal just yet. 4.25 first real wine tasting post Covid Yelps",

I shared the elote which came whole so I'm assuming you just chomp your way through - we asked them to cut it in half so it was easier to eat though. It was pretty good but nothing exceptional. \n\nWe got the shrimp and fish taco which were both pretty fresh! I liked the shrimp over the fish a bit because it had more flavor, but at least they didn't give us a shortage of lime! \n\nChurros were what we ended the night with and it came with 3 sauces - dark chocolate, raspberry and a white chocolate. The raspberry one was my favorite. The churros were tasty but a tad stale. I don't think they make them fresh? They weren't as soft as I was hoping.",

More delicious items to spend money on, as if there wasn't enough already.  \n\nMy suggestion here, grab a sampler pack up by the register first.  They're made with the previous week's best sellers.  This will give you a solid idea of what works vs. what doesn't for you palate.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend checking out some of the interesting cheeses in the cooler.  We scooped up strawberry & champagne cheddar last week and it is fantastical.  It is made by Yancey's out of NY, and their stuff is legit.  Yancey's is also available at Costco and Winn-Dixie, and if I was a bettin' man, I'd say they get their stock from Costco.

  "text": "Zeppoli is definitely my favorite place for dinner in Collingswood. This is a small intimate place for a quality dinner.... and it's BYOB. Major downer for myself it's not on the main Haddon strip and it's hard to get an earlier reservation.\n\nAnyways foods amazing, definitely a place we're you want to get a 4 course meal, which is probably about $40-$65 per person if you like to eat. My favorite pasta is the limone pasta, which is citrusically unique. For my entree, everything is great, swordfish, rabbit... but I usually go with the steak $30. It's a very fatty, large  portion which is served medium. \n\nZeppoli is definitely a great place for a special occasion or a special lady.",

  "text": "This is a review specifically regarding COVID vaccinations. This CVS is pretty busy with drive-thru COVID testing and COVID vaccinations as well as their other business but they appear to have everything running seamlessly. I booked my appointment online. It was pretty simple to use but for some reason it couldn't find my insurance information. Nonetheless, I was able to book my appointment. There were a lot of appointments available as well just none in Brandon. The website shows you which cities have availability, so I advise being flexible if no COVID appoints are available in your city or town. Luckily, this location is only 15-20 mins away from Brandon. \n\nWhen I arrived, there is signage everyone instructing you what to do. If you have COVID testing, stay in your car and drive to the pharmacy. If you have a COVID vaccination appointment, go inside the store. You have to check-in on the text message link they send you just prior to your appointment. Then they give you your vaccination card and direct you to a certain portion of the store. \n\nI wore short sleeves and had drunk the 16 ounces of water that was mentioned in my appointment confirmation email. I sat down in the chair and probably within 2-3 minutes the shot was over. The lady who did the injection was personable and kind and even tried to chat through the short experience. I know this can be nice for people who don't like needles or getting shots as it's sort of a distraction. Then you move on to the chairs they have lined up down one aisle and you wait for 15 minutes. There was a staff member walking the aisle just to make sure you were doing okay and didn't have a reaction. Then you take you vaccination card and coupon for 20% off a purchase and \"I got vaccinated\" sticker and leave. It's very simple and easy. I just wish they had appointments closer to my house. I also thought that there was too much signage. Signs stuck in the grass, signs on the front door, signs taped to the columns in front of the store and the light poles. Too much signage can sometimes be confusing.",

  "text": "I selected Aqimero for a 'fancy' dinner.  Walking in, I was a bit underwhelmed as the restaurant is basically the hotel lobby!  However, I did make reservations in advance and we were promptly seated in a slightly more private area.\n\nAqimero describes their food as a type of Latin Fusion.  Overall, I'm not sure that is a great description, although I did see a mix of Latin and Asian influences.  Our serve took the time to describe a few of the offerings and offered to grab us drinks.  A yelp photo convinced me to order a Tamarind Fizz and it held up nicely.\n\nWe started with the Chifa ceviche and table bread.  The ceviche was a smaller portion than I imagined, but was full of Salmon.  I wouldn't say it was a unique flavor, but it was good.  The bread is probably better described as slices of pita, but with more flavor.  Unfortunately, I wasn't paying attention when it was described so need to gloss over the details here, but would call it very good, especially with the spreads that accompanied it.\n\nFor our main, we split the Pescado Zarandeado for two and a side order of Kale.  The Pescado was ok.  I was disappointed when I found numerous bones still in the fish and wasn't wowed by a portion that was supposed to be designed for two.  Still, it also came with a few plantains which I enjoyed. The kale may have been the best of the evening.  It was sauteed with murshrooms, onions, and topped with pig skin flakes.  Again, my description may not do it justice - order and enjoy.\n\nWe ended by splitting the strawberry ginger ice.  A good dessert and palate cleanser.  Service was great throughout the night, locking an overall experience in the 3.5 star range.  I'd be willing to go back to give them a chance to differenate themselves into that 4 or 5 star range.",

Because this was some of the snarkiest service I've received in a long time.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI hate to kill a place based on one, young employee that probably doesn't even work there anymore, but... this just couldn't go any other way.\n\nYou know those people that sense a younger, laid-back customer, and feel that they can be a bit snarky because of it? Hey, I'm all about that... and that's what I thought I was experiencing here at first. But then after about 6-7 comments, I was pretty sure that she was just incredibly rude, and not worthy of employment.\n\nCondescending, impatient, treated me like a child, complained loudly about other customers, etc, etc, etc. If only I could remember her name, she would be \"on blast,\" as the kids say.\n\nNow... back to not killing a place just based on one bad customer service experience. One of the things I love about traveling new places is trying their local coffee shops. Apparently New Orleans is not a coffee city, as it seemed CC's and PJ's were the best two options. Both served terrible coffee. Like gas station quality. \n\nNew business idea: hipster coffee spot in NOLA. Feel free to steal that one from me, because you'll have no competition. \n\nOr, I'm just a dumbass that managed to miss these places after much research.",

  "text": "I totally get the cult of Federal Donuts; the lovechild of Zahav and Percy Street BBQ.  \n\nThe old corner shop is in a warren of narrow old streets in Pennsport, and the space itself has a tiny charm that could easily be a time warp to the 18th Century.  Standing in line or waiting for an order creates a sense that time has slowed down, and even the dust in the sunbeams may have danced for our forefathers. The combination of Korean style double fried chicken and deep dive dough balls is a natural fit for preparation, but I am not yet comfortable eating both at the same seating. The double dose of fats challenges my guilt. \n\nWhen we arrived mid-Saturday afternoon, all of the fancies were gone, but the 3 daily offerings were available.  Folks were gnawing on their chicken bones at the counter, blissful in their enjoyment.  We ordered a half doz mix of Vanilla Spice, Maple Brown Sugar and Strawberry Lavender to take with us on the drive home.  They were individually bagged while hot, and placed in a larger paper bag, and ultimately triple bagged in a plastic take out carrier.  \n\nOpening the package, the heat and moisture has made the paper sacks damp, but still held in plenty of the essence of the dough wheels. We tried a Vanilla Spice.  It was covered in sugar and cinnamon, cake-like, and uber sweet. The bite and chew was pleasant, but there was no crispness due to the water vapors.  Very tasty.  A very good donut.  Over the next day, the rest were devoured, and although the taste varied with content, the general experience was the same.  A nice round piece of cake with a hole in the middle. \n\nFederal Donuts deserves another house call earlier in the day when the fancies are in stock, and again for a unique fried chicken experience, which seems as varied as the sweet fat tires. \nAfter those ingestions, an update will be in order. \n\nUntil then, the consumed donuts themselves were not life altering, but were certain A-Okay!",

These people are pumping you in and out so don't be discouraged!\n\nIt isn't the cute and quaint decor or the friendliness of the servers that put these people on the map, it boils downright to its breakfast and it ain't healthy and probably not organic. If you're here for the coffee or an option less mainstream you might be disappointed.\n\nSo the pancakes are light and fluffy- with amazing flavor and then there's what they call a cinnamon cream syrup. Don't know what it has in it, don't care what it has in it but it NEEDS to be a part of my pancake experience for the rest of my life. I wasn't a huge fan of the hashbrowns and everything else may be a little hard to mess up on but what they do good they do GOOD and I was definitely a fan of my pancake experience.",

  "text": "I was really surprised by how much there is to do at this park.  There are baseball and basketball areas, an aquatic center, a few shelters, a playground on the north end and a Play 60 Colts inspired playground/fitness equipment area.  But try as it might to be inclusive, the park needs some capital investment in basics like walkways that aren't broken and sadly, more surveillance in the parking areas.\n\nI had been here before about a year ago to take photos of the Thomas Taggart Memorial.  Taggart was the Mayor of Indy from 1895-1901, became a Senator in 1916, and founded Riverside Park.  The Memorial was built in 1931 and was thought to be a treasure of Center Township, but has fallen into disrepair and has been closed off by fences to prevent further vandalism.  A study was done around 2005 to spend $1.3 million to restore the stability of the Memorial, but even now there is little evidence that anything is happening.  This could be a great location for all types of events if restored.\n\nThere is another building that hosts functions, but it seems rather mundane compared to the Taggart.\n\nOne of the newer additions to the park was the Play 60 inspired playground/training equipment that is on the 24th street end of the park.  Colts logos and colors are prevalent throughout the area since the NFL is behind the Play 60 (minutes of exercise/activity each day) program.\n\nI will admit that most of the equipment and shelters appeared to be in pretty good shape.  But like I've seen mentioned in reviews of other city parks, the convenience of having parking lots away from busy streets can attract adults engaging in inappropriate activities.  As I was driving by on a Sunday afternoon, a group of men had gathered in one of the street side lots and their behavior was offensive enough to keep me from stopping.  There is no way I would have wanted to take my grand kids to the park after seeing that behavior.  I can only hope it was an isolated event, but the fact that none of the other men stopped the offending individual was deterrent enough for me.\n\nI truly believe this park has the space and basics for becoming a really good park.  But in the meantime, a little more police presence might be needed to make the park a bit more family oriented.\n\nReview #714",

  "text": "There was really one main reason for planning our trip to New Orleans and that was for the crawfish. I scoured the internet for some boils prior to our trip and we ended up at Urban South Brewery for theirs one evening. It turned out to be the best meal we had in NOLA! It was about $27 for 4 pounds of crawfish, corn, potatoes, and mushrooms, which was enough for me and my boyfriend to share. I probably could've eaten another serving because it was so good. The seasoning was amazing and everything was flavorful. I sucked all the heads! Unfortunately we don't get much crawfish in Michigan so I'll have to go back again.\n\nThe space at Urban South is very open and industrial with communal picnic table seating. The taproom is super kid friendly with books and activities available for kids. There's a retro airstream camper inside and a ton of very cool, unique merch. I loved the t-shirt with the sequin sleeves! I ended up getting a sticker to take home as a souvenir. The guy helping us with beer was great - he recommended the lime gose to pair with the crawfish and gave me a sample to try. It was a spot on choice and it went perfectly with my dinner. Can't wait to go back!",

That is not to say that I was unfamiliar with it, but opted for more \"authentic\" spots when burrito etc. needs arose. After dining here I can better understand their popularity though.\n\nTrish's steak burrito was huge and like everything else here, made to order. I found the beef to be a bit tough and am always turned off when protein is cubed into such consistent pieces. My chicken bowl was perhaps better. The poultry was tender and nicely seasoned with a Tex/ Mex blend. Again another great portion and more suited to a dinner than a lunch. A side of guac was ok, definitely not on par with most Mexican spots.\n\nI would be all in favor of returning if convenience and serving size was my main concern. C's is definitely a good option in comparison with chains that serve similar grub. Maybe even the best option. I prefer to seek out more independent establishments where this type of food is not part of a business plan, but instead the backbone of their food culture. 3.25 still thinking about that whole cilantro fiasco Yelps",

Enough to remember when it was no larger than a two bedroom, 1/2 bathroom little building!! Always a great place to fall into. But not the big bar with the large deck that it is now..\nThere's plenty of craft beer here, drinks and specials are worth the stop.. The menu.... Let me just say that these are probably the best cooked wings in South Jersey. The rest of the menu, by bar standards is very good. I've tried several items without being disappointed yet. \nThe scene... You have the midweek, which is cool and laid back. You have your game nights.. Expect the place to be crowded. Then you have the weekend nights. I recently went on a Saturday just expecting to have an order of wings, a beer or two, then head home. I think people were parking at the Wawa across the street... Let's just say that after being carded and staring at the security for a few, I stepped into the joint, I entered to find a couple hundred of my kids inside... After making my way through my spawns dancing on every inch of space inside, luckily I found a seat at the bar... For the amount of people waving for drinks, the bartenders were doing an amazing job. I wound up having a drink or two with my wings before leaving after about an hour or so.. I told my oldest daughter about my brief stop to eat... She said \"The older folks night is on Sunday, Dad\"!! Okay, Okay... I got it. \nNot the same Skeeter's from years ago. But much better...

  "text": "The Tampa bay Rays are an excellent organization with many great players as well as coaches and front end staff. The Tamp Bay Rays, formerly known as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, play at Tropicana Field. They are in the AL East Division of the MLB. Currently, the Tampa Bay Rays are 2nd in their division, just 1.5 games behind the New York Yankees. That indicates that they are a worthy team of having a large fan base. Unfortunatel, due to many people who live in Tampa being transplants, a large number of people come out to see and support their home teams which is evidenced by games against the Yankees, Red Sox, and the Orioles. Being a fairly new team, there aren't ideally as many loyal, dedicated fans.\n\nThis team may struggle with attendance at games due to the location of the Trop, being in St.Pete, however proposals to move the stadium to a more suitable and accessible location have been futile. Some people do not like the domed stadium but in and of itself it is a marvel and has no obstructing not columns and the seats all are positioned for optimal viewing experience. Being a New Englander the air-conditioned, astro-turfed venue creates a different experience however not a necessarily bad one. When you take the stadium and team for what they are The full baseball experience itself is great, the staff of Tropicana are very accompanying and pleasant and really put a solid effort into making sure that you enjoy your time and have a great experience. The staff really cares about kids and the team itself has kid-geared activities that will keep the little ones happy. Be sure to check out the sting ray tank, you can get up close and personal and pet sting rays in a tank which is a cool bonus. \n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays organization and staff at the Trop work to ensure that their consumers have a great time and I appreciate that.

  "text": "There is no better feeling than leaving Aldi with a sh*t-ton of groceries for less than a hundred bucks.  \n\nThis place keeps the costs low by doing a couple of unique things....the first is you have to \"rent\" a shopping cart if you want to use one...so be sure to bring a quarter.  Don't worry, you'll get your quarter back when you take your cart back to the front of the store and connect it to the other carts.  I freakin' love this because it is MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE at other stores when lazy-arse people leave their carts right next to their car when the cart corral is RIGHT BESIDE their car.  It really grinds my gears. \n\nThe second thing that saves you dollars is they do not give out plastic grocery bags for free.  You can buy paper bags for 6 cents each or bigger plastic bags for 10 cents.  They also sell the reusable bags for like $2 I think.  You are welcome to bring your own bags from home, too.  After you check out they have a nice big counter where you can sort and bag your items before you head out to your car which is nice.  \n\nThey don't really have nationally-known brands here with the exception of Coca-Cola.  Every item I have tried is high quality and comparable to main brands, however.  The quality is high enough that you most likely will not miss your brand name items.  \n\nTheir produce is ridiculously cheap and makes it really easy to eat heathily on a budget.  They have a great meat selection, dairy aisle, bakery section, canned goods, dry goods, beverages, and a lot of hygiene items as well.  \n\nI like keeping my dollars!  And I like high quality foods!   It's a win-win.",

Maybe a sold out crowd and an electric atmosphere would make any venue better, but I do think Citizens Bank is a solid place to catch a game.\n\nThe only things I didn't like? I've never liked the video board out in the left field corner.\n\nThere's a lot more outfield seats, and not much of a view outside the stadium.\n\nThat's about it. \n\nPhilly is the only city with all 4 sporting venues essentially sharing the same parking lot. I would imagine that all cities wished they had this luxury, as parking can be a major problem in some areas. Not in Philadelphia though... one gigantic parking lot for baseball, football, basketball, and hockey. And during our cool, September visit, it definitely felt like more of a tailgate for an Eagles game than anything. We threw the football with people in the parking lot, and crashed a few cookouts. Good times.\n\nThe outside of the stadium is full of baseball statues and team decor. Inside, this park has bette food options than I remember at most parks. I indulged on the Schmitter, which will basically guarantee me a heart attack by age 45.\n\nThe list of negatives is shrinking with every review as we approach the top of the rankings. CBP rounds out the 4-star stadiums!",

Angey pig which had a load of pork and the baked wings were the fare. Pepperoni, salami, bacon, sausage goodness. The one problem was the outer crust was good but the center was a tad soft in the center. I think the cooking style has to adjust for this i think. Aside from that it's a solid pie and wings.

  "text": "Five stars for the pasta, two stars for attention to detail.\n\nLet me set the scene, we went to Indian Rocks beach for a socially distant two-year-old photo shoot for my son (gotta capture the memories). Since the shoot ended at 7 p.m. and my son goes to bed at 8:30 p.m., we decided we would grab takeout near the beach and feed him in the car on the way home. My son is on a solid diet of french fries. \n\nInstead of going to McDonalds (why support chains during this time), I looked up locally owned restaurants. That's how I came across Da Pollani's. I skimmed the menu and saw that their kid's meal chicken cutlets came with french fries. Forget the chicken cutlet, they had french fries so I was sold. \n\nAfter showing the menu to my husband, we decided that for three adults (my dad included) and one super picky eater, we would get: appetizer of Baby Octopus, Chicken Marsala, Fettucini Alfredo, Penne alla Vodka, Margherita Pizza, Eggplant Parmesan and the kid's meal Chicken Cutlets. Yes, we were expecting leftovers. \n\nI called the day of at 4 p.m. and put in the order to pick up at 7:15 p.m. \n\nI love that they have a pickup window. It was super easy to swing up and pay/grab the food. I did notice that none of the staff in the kitchen were wearing masks. The employee that handed me our bill was wearing gloves. \n\nHere's where things got a little dicey. The meal, plus tax and tip, came out to around $150. My husband said at that price he experts great service and I tend to agree (although I wish I could expect great service at any price point). They didn't give us an itemized bill so I was checking everything off the top of my head. \n\nFirst of all, they didn't give us the Margherita Pizza or the fries. Luckily I checked before leaving, so we swung back around. We found out that they no longer serve fries (I wish the woman on the phone told me that when taking our order, because that was the main reason we chose this place. Although I understand this isn't as big a deal for other people). They did give us the Margherita Pizza. However, upon leaving the second time, I realized they didn't give us our side caesar. \n\nI wish they paid more attention to our order to make sure we got everything. Since we live 45 minutes away, there was no point in going back for that caesar. Three things wrong with our order is a pretty high percentage. \n\nOnto the good things, the pasta is amazing. My favorite was the Fettucini Alfredo, which yes, I've since eaten cold and for breakfast. The Penne alla Vodka was also very good. My husband really liked the Chicken Marsala. It was hard to judge the pizza since it was lukewarm by the time we got home, but I love the thin crust and the seasoning. The baby octopus is a must get for me, it was tender and grilled perfectly. I wasn't a huge fan of the Chicken Cutlet, but it's made for kids, so that might be why it lacked more seasoning. \n\nOverall, the food is delicious, but like I said, the attention to detail is definitely missing. I would recommend this place, but you need to be on top of making sure your order is correct.",

  "text": "Um, yeah.  Still friggin' delicious.\n\nJustin and I stopped by Pi before the Neko Case show at The Pageant (located conveniently across the street for all you concert-goers) this week and *finally* tried the deep dish pizza.  Now here's the thing--I grew up eating Chicago-style deep dish and I think I'm supposed to have some sort of loyalty to it because it's my home 'za, yo.  Kinda like so many St. Louisians inexplicably love Imo's.  Anyway, the point is, I've never been a huge fan of the belly bomb that is deep-dish pizza.  Too doughy, too much freakin' cheese (yes, indeed--there IS such a thing!)--I've just always preferred thin crust.\n\nWell.  Smack my ass and call me a convert.\n\n\"It's the crust!\"  I kept saying.  \"No, it's the sauce!\"  Justin countered.  Whatever it was, the deep-dish pizza at Pi is by far, hands down, the best thick crust I've ever eaten.  And I have eaten my fair share of it, people, usually begrudgingly.  No more.  I'd happily hightail it back to Pi to build another custom 'za... This time we enjoyed a pizza with the prerequisite tomato sauce and mozzarella, to which we added zucchini, tomatoes, feta and garlic.  Now, when we got the pizza I thought I spied a mushroom (which Lulu W. so aptly calls \"slugs with gills\" - yuck), but upon closer inspection it turned out to be a whole roasted clove of garlic!  Ohhhh, foodgasm.  So yeah, basically, this was the best pizza ever.  The cornmeal crust is crisp enough to stand up to the delicious sauce and just-right amount of cheese, and you can actually eat more than one slice (this I've not done before).  \n\nYup, I'm changing my tune on the whole deep dish issue.  Sorry, Chi-town.  You still rule my heart, but Pi holds a special place in my belly.",

I say all of that to make the point it was a big deal that I finally just went for it and...drumroll...permed my hair.\n\nTo preface the rest of this review, I will say I had zero color on my hair when I did this, which allowed the perm to take really well. I showed my stylist, Tisha, dozens of photos of perms that I loved and plenty of photos of what I did not want (I was terrified of looking like I stepped out of a 1980's rom-com). She knew exactly what it was I was going for. She incorporated lots of different size rods throughout the perm to give it a really natural look, which totally worked. I didn't expect it to turn out exactly like I wanted...but it did!! And I am so excited about it.\n\nThe whole appointment took about 2.5 hours and consisted of getting my hair washed...A LOT. As she styled and dried my hair, she gave me the full scoop on how to care for my perm (what shampoos/conditioners to use, how to blow-dry it,  how often to get a trim, and when she thought I should come back to touch it up.) I'm so thankful she did, because I'm already finding that curly hair is a heck of a lot different to care for/style than my natural locks. Her perms cost $140, which is a price I am more than happy to pay for her experience and expertise (she's been doing hair for over 30 years and did perms when they were in style).\n\nI left the salon giddy about my new hairstyle. I'm so glad I finally did this and I am SO thankful I came to Tisha for it. It turned out better than I could have ever hoped for! Thank you, Tisha!",

  "text": "An interesting attempt at an urban park, this space of riverside New Orleans starts just downstream of the French Quarter and extends a substantial distance down, containing a path bordered by some greenery and various abandoned warehouses and docks, some of which have been retrofitted into event/workout spaces, and others of which are still abandoned.\n\nWhat's odd about it is that train tracks run parallel to the river, so one has to cross a bridge over the tracks to get to or even see the park. The Western bridge has elevators, but the central one does not (still haven't gotten to the downriver end). There are lights, one set of bathrooms and other modest amenities, but the park doesn't quite seem to be flourishing, if I compare to what's been done with riverside spaces in other cities I've lived in. It also seems a tad scary to me that if you were here at odd hours and had to call the police, they'd have a heck of a time getting to you. I'd stick to scheduled events and clear daylight hours.\n\nI don't think anyone would accuse this stretch of the Mississippi river of being exceptionally beautiful, and the park has some work to do to offer more for visitors, but there is definitely value in being able to catch the breeze off the water and doing so somewhere quieter than the touristy areas upriver.",

  "text": "This has been one of my favorite stops in St. Louis. While in town for a work conference my manager arranged a family-style dinner at Reeds. We were seated upstairs in a dimly-lit room that conveyed cozy despite us having ample space. Our group had a case of the giggles and a touch of the ridiculous about us so it's best for all involved that we were seated away from the main dining area downstairs. \n\nEverything I tried was amazing (really), so I'll just go ahead and walk you through our menu:\n\n+ Bacon-fat-fried cornbread with thyme butter and honey: we could have stopped here with a pan of this cornbread and I'd have slapped a five-star rating on it\n\n+ Veggie toast: I can't remember what all was on it, but it was so tasty. My coworker was kind enough to split his with me because the toast for the table had mushroom and bone marrow, neither of which I was interested in ingesting. I'm not a vegetarian [as evidenced by my ode to that bacon fat cornbread above], but I'm sure if I had spoken up when we received our menu for the evening they'd have happily made me the veg alternative. \n\n+ The best salad of all time: kale, roasted squash, pepitas, bacon, feta, and maple juniper dressing. When I read the description I was kind of \"meh\" because in general I'm not a big fan of kale, maple, or things that taste like gin. This combination though - I can't. They brought us an enormous bowl and we had more than enough so I wish I'd taken more. The chew of the squash with the crispy, salty bacon and the sweetness of the dressing was perfection. Hot tip for other kale salads: chiffonade your leaves so it can be chewed in a reasonable amount of time and effort. \n\n+ Roasted cauliflower: simple, delicious.\n\n+ Polenta with goat cheese, honey, and toasted walnuts: basically a dessert before dessert. The polenta was perfectly creamy and the nuts added the needed crunch. It came in a huge bowl and I could not stop laughing at how it jiggled when moved. \n\n+ Chocolate tart with brown butter caramel, hazelnuts, and fresh whipped cream: so rich, and so delicious. I have a major sweet tooth but I couldn't finish my slice. If I hadn't had the polenta I probably could have done it. I was full by the time dessert rolled around but I wasn't about to pass up such a lovely end to the meal. \n\nA beet salad and porchetta were also served but I did not partake - they both looked beautiful but I was maxed out on food and I don't think I'd be able to handle the fattiness of the porchetta. We also had our choice of wine. \n\nReeds helped set the stage for a perfect dinner with my coworkers - they took what was sure to be a good evening and made it excellent.",

And they do have a lot of those teams and also the local college teams. \n\nStock is good, prices are clearly marked and cheaper likely cheaper than what you'd pay at the game though I am sure they are less expensive elsewhere. Still, if you need a hat or a tshirt or a sweatshirt with your team's logo all over it, this is the spot.\n\n[Review 10425 overall, 192 of 2019.]",

  "text": "Delicious, fun and way too much food. Pho Street is a cafeteria style self serve self clear Vietnamese fast-food restaurant featuring the classic Vietnamese favorite dishes of pho, broken rice and bun style dishes. They don't serve classic Vietnamese coffee just the ice coffee pre-mixed version.\n\nService - automated 4/5\nIt's a little confusing b/c the entire menu isn't posted anywhere and the payment process is a bit awkward. You order through a kiosk and then wait for your number to be called. I recommend staking out the tables closet to the serving area because those bowls of steaming soup are huge and the ramp taking you to the main dining room is daunting especially when attempting to walk the gauntlet with a giant slipping around bowl of boiling hot pho!\n\nHuman Service :) 5/5 \nThe human part of the service is when they call your number and you pick up your order and they're very nice there. \n\nFood...\nPho with eye round & meatballs 4/5\nThe soup was flavorful and the eye round was good. The meatballs are quite tough and rubbery. I'd probably not order the meatballs again.\n\nPho with brisket, eye round & sirloin 4/5\nWork bestie ordered the above and she enjoyed everything except the brisket which was well overly brisket-y.\n\nIce Vietnamese coffee 3/5\nThe cup is only filled halfway and at $4/serving that's like a $1/1.5 oz which is steep especially since it's not made to order and reminded me of melted coffee ice cream good but not $4 good. We could have gone across the street to Trader Joe's and purchased a pint of coffee ice cream for the same price. \n\nIf we go again we will share one order of soup. It was more than enough for two people and at $11/bowl I'd rather share it. \n\nIn summary:\nSo if you avoid the brisket, meatballs and ice Vietnamese coffee and stick with the other options you'll have a 5/5 experience.",

  "text": "Thai Orchid of Blue Bell is a beautifully appointed Siamese restaurant on DeKalb Pike in the wonderfully named town of Blue Bell, PA. It is one of those places where the environment is so rich in southeast Asian colors, textures and artistry, that it is possible to eat the atmosphere. From woodcuts to tapestry the space is relaxed and mellow enough to have you believing you've stepped into a palace in Chiangmai. \n\nI was there for late lunch after a meeting in Norristown. The shop sits in a strip center, the last door on the far right. Don't be put off by that or you'll miss all the magic. There was only one other customer dining when I arrived and was taken to a table on a raised platform that held most of the tables. The menu was full of Thai delights, and lunch combo specials that included soup, appetizer and main entree, for around $10 and change. That seemed the way to go to sample a few things and get more bang for the buck. I went with the Thai Ravioli Soup (wonton), Veggie Roll and Drunken Noodles. \n\nBelieve me, it was a huge amount of food. The soup was vegetable based broth with fancy goldfish wonton filled with ground shrimp and chicken. It had a mild sesame oil flavor and tasted fresh and pleasing. The roll was deep fried with a filling of mixed vegetables, glass noodles and a small dish of sweet & sour dipping sauce. It was good, but a tad over fried.\n\n The drunken noodle was a large plate full of medium width noodles (not jumbo), loaded with chunky onions, bell peppers, green beans, fresh basil, thin sliced beef and moderately hot Thai spices. I asked for it to be very chilified, but it was still pretty tame. It seems that regardless of what you ask for on the heat scale, it is interpreted as only moderately spicy. How you actually get the \"Very spicy yet Bearable,\" fire level is beyond me. Here, it cost them a star for failing to honor my clear direction. \n\nAside from the width of the noodles and the lack of burn, this was a very satisfying meal, and enough to keep me sated for the rest of the day. The decor and food together make Thai Orchid of Blue Bell a worthy stop for quality exotic cuisine. It would be even better if they paid closer attention to what was being requested.",

It is definitely quite sweet, but the shells are nice and crunchy. The ricotta is super creamy, and even a little dense, especially with the chocolate chips. It is on the expensive side, $4, but it is a big, hefty cannoli. You might want to share it. I'd definitely come back to try some of their other baked goods lined up beautifully behind the display case.",

  "text": "For nine years St. Pete Beach has been the Florida beach of choice for my family in the Spring. Usually the trips are for swim meets that my son participates in. Sometimes I can sneak in a trip in between and that was a recent treat. It's one of the nicest family friendly beaches in the country in my opinion. \n\nI typically park at North Shore Park. Plenty of space on non event days and it's FREE! It's directly off the beach and well maintained. \n\nSo why a 5 stars? Because it has everything you could possibly ask for in a perfect beach. Gorgeous sunrises, clean water and beach, restrooms, volleyball, concerts and of course fishing. If there is a drawback it's lack of lifeguards in all areas. Parents supervise your children at all times. \n\nIf you have been to St. Pete Beach you understand my excitement. If not I would recommend you plan a visit. Even during the Winter temps are wonderful. I plan on making this a 10th this year.",

In the end when I was about ready to leave,  someone gave me a bill.  I couldn't believe it.   I sat in disbelief, I pinched myself to make sure I was not dreaming.  What?  A Bill?\n  \nI've never had an experience where the food was homestyle  Louisianna kick me in the pants good.  I was appalled I had to pay because I honestly swear I was invited to this house, LOL  This place is not a restaurant it looks like  a house in the neighborhood.

  "text": "Last May, my buddies and I were treated like kings at this French Market nugget. When I returned to New Orleans over the weekend, there was no doubt in my mind that we would return. And as no surprise to me, the food was absolutely dynamite. \n\nThousands of locals, tourists and foodies stroll by Mother Nature's Cupboard every single day missing out on a flavor ecstasy for the ages. I had to convince travelers to dine here. There are only five seats at the counter, but it's located at the heart of the French Market. You can easily walk and talk with your meal. Scratch that, eating here is like attending church, it's a sacred experience.\n\nI'm flabbergasted that most people decide on the rather Americanized meals, instead of indulging the local flavor. C'mon tourists, you can eat a hamburger and fries anywhere, but can you get Crawfish Mac n' Cheese or Deep Fried Corn anywhere? No, not like this.  \n\nHands down, the most flavorful Mac n' Cheese I've ever eaten. Large, meaty pieces of spicy crawfish fill the cracks of the tender pasta, which is completely smothered in a creamy, rich cheese sauce that will resurrect your taste buds. And Deep Fried Corn? But, how? There are no time for questions folks, just time to munch on crunchy fried corn that will make you as ecstatic as a kid in a candy store. \n\nI remembered the man behind the counter from last year. I'm not sure he remembered me, but we did share a look. One of those looks where you can tell he appreciated your business, because he could tell you were humbled by a great New Orleans meal. Maybe I'm crazy, but maybe you should unstrap your visor a bit, take a deep breath, and experience true local essence. Mother Nature's Cupboard won't be on a Best of New Orleans Food List, but go out of your way to find this pearl.",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because it's a shame it took me so long to come here.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nAfter restaurants reopened, I've made a concentrated effort to visit places that I've had bookmarked for years and just never went to for some reason. 1200 Chophouse was the final local bucket list spot to check off. Don't get me wrong, there are still places I want to visit, but I'm talking about only the top, top tier of restaurants that I've really always wanted to check off. Other new places will open, but as of now, I feel like I've pretty much been everywhere. And I saved a good one for \"last\".\n\nThis time around, Anna M made sure to set her alarm properly, so we arrived a few minutes before 5pm on a Saturday when doors open. We were the 2nd people in line, but by 5:00 on the dot, there were several other customers ready to enter. After only a few minutes of being seated, pretty much every table was occupied. We arrived at 5p because I have a young child at home and I wanted to help with bedtime, but I'm glad we came when we did, because otherwise we would have been in quite the wait. When we walked out around 6:30p, there were many people waiting - some sitting on the couches outside near the road.\n\nThis part of my review is not an indictment of 1200 Chophouse - they are simply following the rules. The rules are 10/10 silly. You must have a mask on inside, unless you're seated at the table. The dining room is not large at all - it was about 8-12 feet from the doorway to our table and another 8-12 feet from our table to the bathroom. So we put on our masks, took about 6 steps, sat down at our table and talked/ate/drank for 90 minutes with no mask on - like every other patron. When I got up to the bathroom, I had my mask on for the 6 steps in route to the single person toilet room. Again, mask on for the 6 steps back to the table. And finally, mask on for the 6 steps out the door. At one point, a server asked a man to put his mask on. The man said, \"what about all of these people?\" The server said, \"they are seated and dining. So he literally grabbed the bar chair that was within arms reach and sat down. Standing? Mask needed. Sitting down, 10 inches to the left? No mask necessary. Again - nothing against 1200 Chophouse, they don't want to get shut down. But the rules themselves? It's just good science.\n\nOnto the food...\n\nWe started off with steak frites and bacon wrapped scallops. The scallops were the highlight of the evening. The smokiness of the bacon complemented the bacon perfectly - I wish I could eat these every day. The streak frites were delicious and the sauce was ideal, but the bacon wrapped scallops stole the show.\n\nAnna and I shared the prime bone-in ribeye special and upgraded to oscar style. This worked out well, as they evenly split the plate for us and removed the bone, but still brought it out for us. We both enjoyed the steak very much. The only gripe I had is that oscar style kind of overwhelmed the flavor of each bite and took away from the natural steak flavor. If I were to return, I'd maybe do a traditional surf and turf where the seafood is separated from the steak.\n\nThe bread and honey butter that came with it was amazing and the salads were great too. I opted for a loaded baked potato as my side dish, which came with big clumps of butter and sour cream to add at my leisure. I added. A lot.\n\nI'd definitely love to come back again, especially for future special occasions. This was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in the St. Pete Beach area!",

  "text": "Why 2 stars? Because the menu change is for the worse.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI really love Oxford Exchange.\n\nAnd I really loved OE Market.\n\nBut this new Mexican theme is just.... rough. Here's how it works:\n\nAs we're used to know with a lot of taco/burrito places, you pick the type of tortilla, the protein, and the veggies in a 3-step process.\n\nOne problem right off the bat is that only the most sophisticated produceista would know what the ingredients are, and what they taste like. I'm a pretty darn adventurous eater, so it's not so much the mystery, but more that I have absolutely no idea what any of these items are. A brief description on the menu board would go a long way. Here's the current process without menu descriptions:\n\n-Walk up to counter\n\n-Have absolutely no idea what you want because the menu is confusing\n\n-Ask the girl behind the counter about 2-3 ingredients\n\n-Feel unsatisfied as you still want to ask about several more items, but don't want to be that dumb that you don't know basically all of the items\n\n-Feel pressured to hurry up and make a decision\n\n-Eventually make a choice, albeit rushed and uninformed\n\nSo the ordering process isn't great, and I'm sure the employees get tired of defining what \"Ancho Creme\" and \"Bustered Shishitos\" are. But how's the food?\n\nMaybe combining the preceding two ingredients with pork in a corn tortilla was a bad choice? But this was probably the worst tasting meal I've had in at least two months. Unfortunately, the flour tortilla was no better.\n\nI just don't get the angle unfortunately. It's near UT, so they want to appeal to college kids... but the menu says hoity-toity. Still, the tacos are affordable at $3-$4, so I guess that makes sense. What doesn't make sense are the $10-$12 juices that are still being sold here. I tried one because, well, I figured a $12 juice had to be pretty amazing. Instead, it was unfortunately the opposite. Kind of watery, and hard to finish. I would have felt that I overpaid at $2.\n\nI hate giving negative reviews, but I just can't really avoid it in this situation.",

Absent effective management, the majority of the staff were hiding in the kitchen doorway and doing nothing to help one waitress who was struggling to keep up with the lunch crowd.

Once a small cup of the sauce for their signature burger arrived it also tasted pretty good, although it was cold by that time. \n\nYes, they share a name with two pretty good places I frequent. No, this location doesn't have any business being associated with those other two brewpubs. \n\nFinal note: we asked for the manager to deliver our check so we could rip his/her head off for the crappy experience.

Of course the kids did devour the truffle fries but who wouldn't.\n\nBeing in a Pizza place of course we have to order their pizza so we got the Noble Pig which came topped with pepperoni, sweet fennel sausage, spicy soppressata, pickled peppers, caramelized onions, tomato sauce, fontina, parm, and sunny side up egg.  All i have to say is WOW it was a cornucopia of 2,000 calorie deliciousness.  \n\nOverall the service and food here were awesome. I would definitely recommend coming here for a great meal if you are in the Wesley Chapel area.",

  "text": "Ahh...I absolutely love coffeeshops!  It brings me back to my graduate and undergraduate days as well as high school!\n\nAnywho,living in Mid-City I try to support local (although Starbucks your soy chai lattes are pretty friggin awesome but CC's has changed their chai and it's driving me nuts!).  This is my idea of an eclectic coffeeshop.  I remember when Rue de la Course is where the Rum House currently resides.  People were allowed to smoke and there were banker's lamps on each table.\n\nWell, Fair Grinds, you had me at banker's lamps.  Plus, they have an outdoor seating area which I have yet to try.  I'm a night owl so you won't see me out and about before 11am on a weekend unless I'm going to church or forced to leave puttering in my apartment.  Plus, bonus that they are open later than PJ's so I'm all about it!  I even ran into my favorite waitress from Nonna Mia there (ok so I eat at Nonna Mia alot to have a relationship with the waitress, manager, and other waiters! hehe).  She also gave me the FYI that Zotz on Oak is open even later if I can't get everything done in time.  Good to know!\n\nI also enjoy that Fair Grinds is located in the mix, it's on the same street as Cafe Degas, Canseco's, Maple Street bookstore, Swirl, and a salon that I haven't frequented yet.  There is street parking.\n\nAlso, the staff are friendly, there is only one unisex bathroom, adorable outdoor seating, free wifi, and a delicious soy chai latte!\n\nAm happy to have found a neighborhood! \n\nHappy coffee coffee drinking!",

Been pumping iron at retro for about a month and I really like this gym. People keep to themselves and are polite with machines and weights. \n\nThere are plenty of free weights and usually not too many people. Also there are tons of cardio machines, I have never had to wait. \n\nAs an added bonus this gym has a movie cardio room, its a nice and darker less people to look at you running on a hamster wheel.",

  "text": "Worst hotel I've ever stayed at. The hallways are very depressing. The layout of the hotel is very odd, it took 10 minutes to get to our room from the lobby. We were happy to see a Starbucks inside hotel next to lobby, but sad to find out they clise at 1pm. \n\nThe housekeeper was fighting verbally with soMeone on her phone and as were walking to our room, you can hear EVERYTHING thru the door, and the door was closed. The smell was unpleasant all the way from the hall and in our room. \n\nThe views are amazing as we did have a corner unit, but it was very sad staying there. The tub was oxidized,  the towels had holes and showed lots of wear and tear. I was disgusted to even take my shoes off. \n\nLuckily we were just passing thru on our way back to Dallas from Chicago and only needed one night, but NEVER ever again. \n\nThe valet was a joke. The young guys they have are nice and we're very polite, but the way the system works for valet is unbelievable. When you want to request your car, you cannot call or text, you actually have to take the elevator DOWN one floor to the hot stuffy basement and hand your ticket to the guys working there. Then it gets WORSE, they ask you to wait in their \"waiting room\" which is disgusting, smells awful and has rust and sticky stuff all over the floors. \n\nPlus it's $40.00 for this overnight so called valet service. This side of St. Louis looks run down, old, abandoned and very depressing. The only thing good is the view of the St. Louis Arch but for $360.00 a night it is not worth it.\n\nEverything is dated.",

Wonderful short video, and informative displays provide an overview of the park. Rangers available to answer any questions. A must stop for visitors visiting Tucson.",

I'm not sure how old this location is but everything still looks almost brand new.  The equipment here is the Precor brand.  I counted around eight treadmills.  For cardio they also have a stair climber machine, which isn't common at Anytime Fitness locations.  The dumbbells and fixed weight barbells go up to 110 pounds instead of the standard 100 pounds.  There's a smith machine and a power rack in the free weight area.  The large room for group classes had multiple cycles for spinning classes.  These Riverview Anytime Fitness locations are the only ones I've seen that have that option available for people.  Pretty cool considering that many Anytime Fitness locations don't have a separate room like this in the first place!  Little things this location has that I wish every one would have: vending machines that take credit cards and a way to recycle your water bottle.  It's located two miles from I-75 so it's another convenient option for me when I'm passing by here.",

I paid for my smoothie and bag of chips and a bottle of water, then proceeded to wait for my smoothie while munching on the bag of chips. I noticed the girl finished making the smoothie for the flight attendant ahead of me, then started washing the used items. I figured she was just cleaning when I realized that she had no intention of making my smoothie. She then started to clean around the cash register and restocking donuts. As I finished my bag of chips and had been waiting 5 minutes, I finally asked if my Apple Kale Smoothie was ready. The blonde girl making smoothies seemed to have heard this order for the first time and asked Marlene at the register if she had heard about this. Excuse me??\n\nShe finally made my smoothie and I assumed she was multi-tasking because she began tidying up around the register again. As soon as she came out from behind the counter and started tidying up the snack display when I snapped. The smoothie was sitting untouched in the blender. I asked whether my smoothie was ready basques my flight had started boarding. Finally, the lady manning the register finally poured it into a cup and handed it to the blonde girl to hand to me. \n\nI don't understand whose responsibilities are what but what happened is not ok. Unfortunately, a survey was not available to me on the receipt, otherwise I would have made sure the young blonde's behavior was not acceptable in any situation. \n\nIn other news, my smoothie was a little sweet but tasted fine.",

  "text": "So far, I have not been too impressed with the food trucks in Nashville. So, with no real expectations in mind I went over to The Hot Spot trailer while they were parked at Turtle Anarchy. I had never heard of them before this so with the 'deer in the headlights' look I approached cautiously. The person behind the counter offered some suggestions. Their Twisted Chicken, with Jamaican jerk spice and Asian hot sauce, it's Sriracha. I don't know why they don't mention it by name, it's like calling Guinness 'Irish stout from the St. James brewery.' I don't think I've met someone who doesn't love Sriracha so no need for euphemisms.\n\nAnyway, it was $7 for two big pieces of their chicken, spiraled with Sriracha and a separate container containing their fennel slaw. I've been similarly unimpressed with hot chicken but once I sat back down at the bar and opened the container it was a flaky, spicy, but still tasty piece of chicken. The hot chicken I've gotten was just heat but with very little flavor. The chicken, while sweat pouringly, mouth burningly spicy was still really tasty. I kept biting into it thinking 'oh man this is good' while wiping my face on my sleeves, careful to avoid rubbing my eyes with any heat. The random smoothness of the Sriracha with the spice in their batter was awesome. Their fennel slaw, was also really tasty with plenty of fennel seed in the mix and it was basically the only thing that could keep the heat down-too bad that there was so little of it.\n\nMy friend came later and I got her the patty melt as a belated bday dinner. She really seemed to like it and it's probably the only thing on the menu that doesn't have spice on it. He was even nice enough to walk it into the brewery when it was ready. \n\nHe eventually left because of the lightning that came in \"me in a little metal box with lightning around, I'm leaving\" and as my friend and I were thinking of eating again we told him how sad it was that he was wrapped up to go. He gave us what he had left, a huge basket of fries and three big pieces of chicken for free. He's changed my mind about food trucks and hot chicken, but more slaw please!",

I read that 25m people have seen her on YouTube and Facebook and all that and she's never actually recorded a video of herself for promotion. I've seen her since then at the tents at Jazz Festival and Satchmo Fest and she's where the love and the party's at.

We ordered our food to go. And were really surprised that it was cash only. Not really understanding the concept here other than service fees to the restaurant when using debit or credit. Luckily we had a bit of cash on there and I do believe they have an ATM on site. \n\nWe enjoyed a beer while we waited, only about 30 mins on a Friday night.  The pizza was so pretty when we got home and opened the box.  I really really enjoyed the sauce and toppings.  It was packed full and one piece was all I needed.  The crust on the other hand tasted like baking soda.  Very bitter. Not sure what went wrong there. \n\nEven though it was not pizza perfection and I doubt it's the best representation of this style of pizza, I would absolutely give this place a shot again.",

Morrow's is neatly tucked on the corner and upon entering you are immediately given warm and woodsy vibes with all of the stained wood and the bar, oh my goodness, is it gorgeous.\n\n\"Morrow of the story...\"\n\nThe fluorescent neon pink sign with a backdrop of foliage is stunning. In a pre-COVID world, I could picture myself being at the bar having multiple cocktails taking plenty of photos for the 'gram.\n\nReality currently had us waiting patiently for a table since they are really implementing social practices!

You have to wear a mask upon entry, they have a table blocking the entrance so folks can't simply go in-n-out, and there is a host to greet and make sure everyone is practicing safety and social distancing. Plenty of hand sanitizer all around.\n\nWe were eventually seated and absolutely no anxiety because they are so conscious about spacing of the tables. It honestly felt a little exclusive tbh. All of the staff was wearing masks and very, very friendly.\n\nOnto the dishes we ordered...\n\nCrawfish Bread: I literally wanted to cry tears of happiness because it was so good that I would've allowed someone to throw water in my face if it meant I would get a second plate of these for free. JUST GET THE DAMN APPETIZER.\n\nFried Chicken: Every crunch had the most flaky bite of fried chicken, I've had in SUCH a long time. I was sad when we realized we ate all of the fried chicken.\n\nCharbroiled Oysters: Piping hot with the cheese drip. So fresh and the seasonings were divine. ORDER A DOZEN.\n\nCrawfish Pasta: We asked for extra bread to slop up the sauce. ORDER EXTRA BREAD and you too will be happy you did. I legit had to make sure our server didn't take the dish until everything was eaten. I don't even like catfish, and I ate one of the two strips so fast I forgot to mention I hate catfish to my friend. The crawfish sauce had a nice spice (but not too spicy) and the pasta was al dente and cooked perfectly.\n\n10s 10s 10s across the board. Make a trip to Morrow's ASAP!",

  "text": "A suburban bar that I actually wanted to take back to Philly with me. Who knew other than the friends I was visiting that showed it to me? McGillicuddy's is a pretty chill bar tucked on an unassuming nook of Ardmore. It's a little bit of a franchise, but it's not as bad as Great American Pub. It's not too Sport's Bar, even though it has it's ample share of big screens tuned into various games. It's not too much of a dive, even though it has the weekly specials, quizzo, and karaoke that make it pretty equal to one. It's pretty much the perfect in between bar.\n\nAfter my friends jammed at Milk Boy Coffee we took it to JD's for the after party. When I saw the 5 big screen TVs and a DJ starting to spin some bad hip hop that I wanted to continue forgetting about I initially stifled a groan. But I picked up some reasonably priced beer and mock danced with some friends. And as the night and beers progressed it got better.\n\nThe DJ had his manic moments like mixing Snoop Dogg with New Order. and he even tried to scratch to -say it isn't so- Phil Collins??? But when he had his good moments he was pretty flawless. If he controlled those off moments he could be kicking it at Silk City (especially since he was better than most of the DJs who spin there when he was good). The only flaw to the dance floor? Not enough dancing. Wake the fork up suburbia! Some of my friends and I held it down though.\n\nSaving the best thing about the bar for last. They had a movie style pop corn machine that hooked up free pop corn to the masses. Sounds like a winner that's worthy of being in Philly to me. and after scoping up the web site it looks like one is moving into the spot that used to be Whiskey Dix. Interesting.",

  "text": "Umami is a newly opened pan-Asian restaurant serving authentic Japanese, Korean and Thai food. I live in Chicago, but I go to Nashville often to visit family and friends (I stayed in Brentwood area), so it was nice timing for me to try out this new restaurant and I got to try a lot of their menu items with our group. They've got a great variety of dishes on their menu, and everything we had was delicious. You can tell that everything is made from scratch here, as well as using fresh, authentic ingredients. Here's my review on each item, in no particular order:\n\nKimchi fries: This is a fun take using a Korean classic (the kimchi) and an American snack (cheese fries). I loved all the flavors and textures on this dish: crispy hot french fries topped with ooey, gooey nacho cheese, sauteed kimchi, scallions, and a white sauce that I can only guess is mayo (or sour cream?). I will try to update this when I find out. \n\nKorean Fried Chicken: One of their more popular items (according to our server). You can select the soy garlic or the spicy sauce, or go half and half with your order (6 pcs, 10 pcs, 20 pcs, 30 pcs). I wanted my son to be able to try it, so I opted for the soy garlic. That did NOT disappoint! It's the perfect blend of that umami flavor that comes from soy sauce paired with the garlic flavor. It comes with a side of pickled radishes that is the perfect complementary crunch with your chicken. This is actually how fried chicken is served in Korea, and it's excellent. No need to travel all the way to Seoul!\n\nTuna poke: this is your classic tuna poke (pronouned poh-kae), which is a salad of raw tuna, cucumber and avocados. There were large chunks of fresh tuna, marinated and seasoned well (not overpowering the tuna or anything). \n\nSpeaking of fresh...can't get any fresher with the sashimi plate! We got a variety of sashimi to share, and I seriously loved every type of fish! If you're adventurous, you can try the freshly fried shrimp head if you order the sweet shrimp sashimi. The kitchen basically deep-fries the actual shrimp head that's taken off the body of the raw shrimp. For some of you, that sounds like something that could be shown on Andrew Zimmern's show, Bizarre Foods. But like he says on his show...if it looks good, eat it!!!!!!! Ahng!!!!! \n\nMango Tango Maki Roll: one of the recommendations from our server -- did not disappoint! I asked for this roll without cream cheese (I just do not prefer to have any cream cheese in any of my rolls) and it was not even an issue (I mention this, because some restaurants don't like to customize the maki roll orders -- \"no substitutes\" policy at those places). I don't think I've ever had a \"sweet\" maki roll before, and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavors of this roll. The spicy crab and mango/strawberry actually went really well together. I'm glad that they can be inventive with their maki rolls, as well as serve the usual crowd favorites. \nSide note: I love the fun names of the maki rolls -- ranging from \"Pokemon Go\", \"Music City\", and \"the \"OMG Roll\" (I imagine this one will make you say OMG haha)\n\nKorean Chicken Tacos: You can choose from beef, chicken or pork for the Korean tacos. My son loves chicken, so we just went with the safer option (still delicious). I guess we could have tried the combo, I think that comes with one of each taco, maybe? This is also a very fun take on some classic Korean flavors with a little Mexican twist: the chicken has a Korean marinade, topped with Asian pickled radishes and cilantro, served in a warm corn tortilla.\n\nSeafood Ramen: If you're familiar with and (like me) LOVE the Chinese-Korean noodle dish called \"Jjam-bbong\", then you will equally fall in love with this dish! The noodles are obviously the ramen noodles, but in the spicy seafood broth that is used for the \"jjam-bbong\" dish. I can tell that they use fresh seafood for the broth, because it's spicy and refreshing, not fishy at all! I was actually thinking about this bowl the next day...and how much I wanted to eat it again. The next time I'm in town, I will definitely be coming back to get this dish again!\n\nBeer Selection: They have an AWESOME beer selection, with some local and international beers. I love checking out local beers wherever I go, and the ones I tried were awesome. They also have some great ones on tap. \nFun tip: Order a large pitcher of beer, and it comes out in this REALLY fun pitcher that has dry ice and flashing lights -- so flashing smoke from your pitcher. It's not just for funsies, though...it keeps your beer nice and cold so that every pour is just as refreshing as the first.\n\nI saw a lot of people coming in for pick-up orders, so if you don't have time to sit down in the restaurant, you could always call ahead and pick up on your way home (or wherever you're headed).\n\nOverall, a wonderful meal and experience at Umami. Keep it up, guys! I'll be coming back soon.",

You first walk into the wine shop. There you can purchase bottles to enjoy or order some food. They have a good selection of wines from all over the world. The staff is knowledgeable too so they can help you make the right choice.\n\nOnce you have your wine you can head outside to the garden area where there is a lot of seating options. While we were there they also had live music. It was nice because it was not overpowering so you could enjoy it and still have a conversation.\n\nThere is a bar area upstairs if you prefer the more traditional route for your alcohol consumption. There are bathrooms just off the garden area and a set up in the bar area.\n\nWe were full so we did not try any food. The wine though was very good. The prices were fair too. We will definitely be back here on our next trip to the area. It is a great place to enjoy some drinks and get a few minutes away from the awesome craziness on Bourbon Street.",

From the shampooing to the cut to the blow drying, I felt like my stylist moved swiftly and expertly. However, I was a bit disappointed this morning. Even though my hair had looked fine yesterday after styling, today it looked chunky and uneven. Perhaps my stylist may not have been very experienced with Asian hair (she seemed very experienced from the bio posted on the ARS website). I will have to go get that fixed because I have a dressy occasion to go to later this week. A bit painful to have to shell out another $50+ to correct this, but good thing I got this haircut earlier in the week!",

  "text": "Small froyo shop in the cute neighborhood off of Delmar and North & South. There were 2 vegan options: cinnamon and banana. I liked neither.  They had a watermelon flavor, but it contained dairy. WHY??!! The kids loved their flavors, which included salted caramel, chocolate, and cheesecake.  They offer 2 cup sizes here: large and larger. So no matter how little you put in even the smallest cup, it's gonna cost you $5. I'm not a fan of this money-grabbing practice.\n\nI hear that they rotate the flavors often, so I wouldn't be against returning to see if they have more appealing vegan options next time.  However, in general, they are over-priced and would not be my first choice for dairy-free dessert. \n\nAlso, if the cramped little parking area on the side of the building is full, there is more parking in the back, off of North & South.",

  "text": "SHRS was originally a sanitarium, using the natural spring waters to heal all sorts of ailments. The springs are now covered up, but the resort still maintains a 20's era spa feel. Take a moment and browse the old black and white photos and paintings in the grand salon. \n\nFront office staff is very friendly and helpful, they even upgraded us to a balcony room just by us asking. The rooms are gigantic, and ours had a view of the bay. Free self-parking is a plus, although technically you're paying for it with the $15 resort fee. \n\nThere are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance of the resort, although we found many of them closed on Sunday. \n\nBreakfast is either buffet ($14) or a la carte, with some healthy \"spa\" options available, like yogurt parfait or egg white omelets. The pancakes are awesome, as were the oatmeal and coffee. \n\nOne issue we found was a shortage of towels and chairs at both pools. The website photos are very deceiving, making the pools look huge, when in fact they are very small. Not nearly large enough to accommodate a resort with this many guests. There is also no breeze whatsoever, making it unbearably hot. People were basically just hanging out in the water, eating and drinking inside the pool, which was gross. \n\nOverall a relaxing stay and a great value, if you prefer a quieter area and venue.",

What I also like about their donuts is that they are thick and have a nice chew. I ordered the Hibiscus Donut and the Cinnamon Roll. Both were really good but of course lent different flavors. One was more fruity and light and the other more cinnamon and warm. The hibiscus was my favorite. I loved the fruity notes that came from this donut. It even had a candied orange on top. The orange was a nice addition. The cinnamon roll donut was good but for me a little too much. It just seemed heavy. While the flavors were different they were good to try. Overall, I enjoyed District Donuts.",

Touted as a \"conversation bar\" because it is free of all other distractions like tv, loud music, games, crowds, etc. It is a civilized lounge in a quite unique and creative atmosphere. It resembles a library in furnishings and in the quiet, subdued tone. Opened books make up one of the walls from floor to ceiling. They have the old card catalog filing system pieces of furniture from back in the day! Upside down lamps hang from the ceiling for lighting. The bar is beautiful. \n\nThey offer local beers, have a nice wine selection and a focused selection of spirits. The emphasis as far as spirits go is on the whiskey.",

The anchor store seemed to be the Bloomingdale's outlet, while the other mall staples like Victoria's Secret (it's not so secret anymore), Claire's, Bath and Body Works, and Auntie Anne's were present as well.

It's located on Route 66 in a very pretty neighborhood and part of the experience is enjoying the ambiance as you stand outside waiting to order.\n\nThis is the first place I ever had frozen custard, that luscious concoction that is richer than ice cream and usually prepared soft serve style to lend itself to all sorts of invention.   The richness is due to high butterfat and egg content and minimal air.\n\nImportant term:  \"concrete\" - the frozen custard equivalent of a Dairy Queen Blizzard, you pick your mix-ins and they blend it up into decadent goodness.\n\nOne of my favorite items at Ted Drewes is the Christie, which is actually a sundae:  a brownie, frozen custard, hot fudge, and caramel ($5).

  "text": "I like this Jamba Juice location in Pennsylvania; it's nice and clean and customer service is friendly and service is fast.  The night before coming to this Jamba Juice location, I ate something that didn't agree with me.  I woke the next morning and my lips were burning (I thought they were just chapped from the cold weather).  I decided to look in the mirror at the hotel room I was staying at and my lips were enormous (naturally I freaked out)!  I contacted my sister who is in the medical field and lives in Philly and she suggested I take a Benadryl.  My husband left the hotel to buy me some Benadryl ; by the time he came back, my tongue expanded and I could not talk; I was having an allergic food  reaction to something I ate the night before. I couldn't eat because my tongue was so big so I had to chew the Benadryl on one side of my mouth (talk about disgusting)!  The Benadryl knocked me out for five straight hours and when I woke up, I was starving!!!  My husband drove me to Jamba Juice and I got a pomegranate paradise smoothie; at that point in time, my tongue and lips were back to normal. The smoothie was delicious and my husband got a smoothie too; a razzmatazz.  This was the first time I had the pomegranate smoothie (which is now my favorite smoothie at Jamba).  The workers were really friendly and helpful as we drank our Jambas at a table inside the shop.  I obviously won't be back here anytime soon since I live in California but, this was definitely one of the nicer Jamba Juice locations I have been to in the more recent years.",

  "text": "I may be a local type of guy when it comes to most things in my life I shop, but this chain has my admiration. I have never written lower than a 4 stars at the half dozen or so stores I've visited. This was my first time at this Tampa store located four miles from the airport. \n\nRight off the plane and practically to Total Wine prior to closing on a weekday evening. I only needed one bottle of wine, but it needed to be a great one and I planned on being picky. However I also had little time. \n\nWhat many customers may not know is the secret behind the staff knowing how to make recommendations. The receive a case of wine and beer a month to try, write notes and then make recommendations to customers. Throughout the store you will see this on shelves with the face of a staff member. This is legit if you ever wondered. I went right to work and asked a staff member to help me with a high end NAPA Cabernet that would be similar to a Caymus, but not priced at $80. \n\nThe staff discussed options and ultimately called the manager Doug to come over. After around 10 minutes of deciding on three choices I settled on a hard to keep in stock 2013 Baldacci Fraternity. It's a bold red blend with cherry and tobacco flavors. The maker even designed sediment to be in the pour like an old aged wine would be. The bottle was taken to a group dinner in St. Petersburg. I actually had this wine maker before and was excited. The wine proved to be marvelous at the $44 price point and opened beautifully in the glass. \n\nI will continue to shop Total Wine for the selection, price and more importantly the knowledge that staff have about products. Thank you Doug.",

  "text": "You know the \"Tell me about the chicken\" scene from Portlandia?*  Well. That's us.  Hubby and me.  So a drive through burger kiosk in a strip mall parking lot is a highly unlikely place to find us given we have long been of the \"know what is in your food and where it comes from\" types.  To make it even more unlikely that we'd end up placing our order at a kiosk with \"Burger\" in the name, I share the \"he\" of we won't eat beef in any form and the \"she\" won't eat it ground - unless \"she\" sees it ground in a butcher shop from a range raised cattle cut of her choice. \n\nBut here \"we\" ended up at a drive up burger kiosk after reading about the owner, Shad Cupp, who range raises the Scottish Highland cattle at his BVR Highland ranch and who started the ranching enterprise after having an epiphany about the flaws in our food supply when he saw \"Food, Inc.\" and was then wrestling with his own health problems being compounded by a fast food diet.\n\nLearning he also had pork products from his pasture raised hogs, this kiosk was a destination dining choice even though we knew the only place to eat would be at picnic tables in the parking lot given we didn't think our \"little piggy\" brats would hold up all the way home.\n\nTHE EATS:  Eat the brats we did at that picnic table, every single bite - the \"he\" in a spicy Italian rendition (he is Sicilian after all) and the \"she\" in the classic with mustard and kraut - and licked our fingers clean of the yummy black pepper rich salt on the french fries too.  Another unlikely sighting for us given except for the true pommes frittes at Bacquet's in Eagle or Petite 4 on the Bench we don't eat french fries either.  And given both \"he\"' and \"she\" are lighter eaters with a lifetime of weight control challenges in the mix it is also unlikely to see us eat an entire dish of anything - sharing being usual MO - but a whole brat each was consumed with gusto.    Fresh made sausages using BVR ranch raised pork are served on local baker Gaston's buns and with local MFT ketchup for the fries and all at only about $10 each.  (The price includes a large soft drink, but on those we passed.) \n\nTHE OWNER:  Maybe it was seeing us lick our fingers that made the nice guy who owns this come out to ask us how we enjoyed the food.  It gave us a chance to talk about our shared perspectives on the importance of humane and sustainable practices in animal husbandry and learn more about his business.  With his adult son, Hoss, now largely running the ranch Shad has the time to run the kiosk and associated food truck.  He'd like to be able to expand for other kiosk locations in the area so that people don't have to eat bad food to eat convenient food.  And while his animals are currently dispatched and processed at the only USDA approved facility in the area, he would one day like to have his own on ranch facility to do that to have end-to-end control of his product.  (If he does that, I'm on board for one of those burgers too!)  He realizes a kiosk isn't ideal - no seating or loo for customers and all - but it was the affordable place to start.\n\nTHE DRILL:  Drive up to the window and a nice young 'un (on our day a delightful young woman who we assumed was a relation) will take your order.  Then if there is a car behind you, the same young 'un will go to that car to take theirs so the delay is minimal for waiting for food to be cooked (on our day Shad was doing the cooking).  But this is cooked to order eats, not McDonald's drive through, so set expectations for a little time being needed.  If you're planning on eating at the picnic tables, they'll offer to bring the food to you or you can walk up to the window to fetch your own (our choice) when it is ready. \n\nTHE SCENE*: Sure, you know it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErRHJlE4PGI\n\nPS:  God bless small ranchers and farmers who use sustainable agricultural models to provide good and healthy things for people to eat.",

Thus, you get options and, if you have a group, everyone is pleased.  So when I heard that Arnold Myint was going to open up a spot I was excited.  Real food, likely healthy, likely fresh, likely the tastiest thing in the place - what's not to love. \n\nSo I showed up with some coworkers who weren't as adventurous as me and went to another place.  That's the great thing about FM!  Anyway, I perused the sides and decided I really wanted some curried quinoa.  The sides come in little small containers although I think you can order larger (like think large enough to take some home for the family).  I picked out a turkey sandwich and also got a bag of the homemade chips.  Verdict: loved the quinoa, wish I had gotten more.  Sandwich - ok, better than Subway of course, but still it was, in the end, just a turkey sandwich.  Will bust out with a different choice next time!  Chips were yummmy.  I also liked the iPad checkout station where you just sign your name right on the screen - a little oasis of class in the craziness of the Farmers Market.  I also got to see Arnold Myint himself which was cool because I totally rooted for him when he was on Top Chef!\n\nDefinitely give this place a try next time you are at FM having lunch.  You will leave pleasantly filled with healthy food and will be the only one not in a food coma at work later that afternoon!",

  "text": "If this is your favorite spot, please bend your ears for a moment, or more let's say, skip this review :D\n\nWe'd settled on Thai for lunch. We called in our order, and were told it would take up to 20 minutes for our lunches to be ready for pick up. My friend Colleen, opted for healthy Fresh Thai Shrimp Spring Rolls for a waistline friendly starter. I'm in love with any thing ginger, so I got the Ginger Chicken. Colleen and I shared both. Also, we got Supreme Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice & Coconut Cream, one for each of us.\n\nUpon my arrival, I was standing at the host desk for a good five minutes, no one came to help me. Then, the first person I saw, failed to greet me, and when I went to the desk to let the host know I was there to pick up my order, he totally did brushed me off, and was unpleasant!!!!  Have you just looked at someone and automatically felt annoyed? I did, and all what I'm saying is that host/hostess have to mind their p's and q's. \n\nMy lunch came out after SIXTY minutes and I went \"Ba Dum Tss!\" \nBesides the bad customers service, the food was just okeyish. The fresh spring rolls were too healthy and tasteless, like fresh grass. Totally off-putting!\nThe Ginger Chicken I ordered, was described in the menu as ( Sautéed with cashews nut, onion, scallion, bell pepper, carrot in chili paste and light garlic sauce.)\nThe ginger had an overwhelming kick to it, and there was no sign of any spicy chili paste! Also, absolutely NO cashews in there, or scallion. There was no flavor, and no tongue's satisfaction in that dish whatsoever! \n\nHow can anyone mess up a very simple dessert like sticky rice?!! My order of Supreme Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice & Coconut Cream  was a failure. The rice was incredibly sticky, stiff and hard to chew. Enough said!\n\nObviously I will not be returning, not only because of the below average food, but also because of the poor service and unpleasant staff.\n\nTwo Yelps!",

It was also an added bonus that it was inside a beautiful park. \n\nThe line on a Saturday morning wasn't awful. We waited about 10 minutes to place our order and was served almost immediately. It's a little bit challenging to find tables here, but you can definitely choose to enjoy the beignet on a park bench or on the grass if you'd like. \n\nThe beignets are best when served warm and are worth it! They're the perfect treat for your weekend!",

  "text": "Been here many times throughout the last year. I came here once for karaoke night. Once on a Friday night and another time on a Saturday night. The Monday night that they had karaoke was actually one of the best nights I had there. The other two nights were just really loud and the bartender wasn't making the drink I asked for. The drink I wanted had 2 different types of liquor in it and he just changed it around so it only had the cheap liquor out of the spout. Was pretty disappointed with that, while it tasted okay it was only because there was so much excess juice! I'm giving it three stars, because they do have a cider in a bottle and the karaoke night was really fun! They had a live karaoke band that played along with you and then at the end of the night best show won some sort of cash prize.",

  "text": "Why 2 stars? Because our experience was pretty poor.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nAfter researching all of the pet resorts in Tampa Bay pretty thoroughly, we felt really good about leaving our dog at Camp Bow Wow while we left town for Thanksgiving. My girlfriend used to drop her old dog off at the Brandon location, and she loved it. Plus, the Tampa location is super convenient on our way to the airport. \n\nI asked the guy who checked us in, how much time is spent in their kennel, vs how much is spent out playing. He said that they are up at 6am to eat, and 90 minutes after eating, they are out playing all day long until dinner time in the evening. Making sure that our pop receives plenty of exercise, and is not being locked away in a cage all day was very important to us, and the primary reason we went to a \"pet resort\" over an old fashioned kennel.\n\nOne of our other favorite things about Camp Bow Wow, was that they have webcams in all of the play areas, so that you can check in with how your pup is doing all throughout the time that he is there. Well, we certainly did check on him a lot, and it was pretty alarming what we found over the course of his 4 day stay.\n\nWe checked out the cameras about 15 times, at all different times of the day. 8a, 10a, 1p, 3p, etc etc. The dogs were out playing twice out of the 15 times we looked. \n\nSo when we picked him up Monday morning, I asked about that, and this is the answer I was given:\n\n\"Yeah... we had some new people working and a lot of dogs here, so we got a little behind on the schedule.\"\n\n\"Behind on the schedule\" is definitely an interesting way of saying that the dogs were out playing maybe about 10-20% of what we were told. I could understand if instead of them being out at 8am on Thanksgiving morning, things were pushed back an hour or two. Or maybe an incident where a clean up pushed things back 30 minutes. But to tell us our dog will be out playing for 8+ hours a day, and in reality, he might have been out playing for 8 hours combined over 4 days.... that's pretty unacceptable, and I don't think I'm in the minority saying that.\n\nAnd to make things worse, he acquired kennel cough at Camp Bow Wow, which was also lovely. That was not an inexpensive trip to the vet.\n\nSo needless to say, we had two upcoming vacations that involved our pup heading back to Camp Bow Wow, but those were immediately cancelled, as soon as we found alternatives.",

  "text": "Warning: this review is a bit of an ode to my love for properly made grits. I may go overboard. \n\nThe location is great. It is in the heart of downtown near the convention center and near the Hertz office where we rented a car for the day. \n\nOur server was so nice and helpful. As I have mentioned in prior reviews, I have a myriad of food allergies, most of which are at issue in Louisiana cooking: peppers, chilis, potatoes, and tomatoes. As a result, I could not order any hollandaise options off the menu because it is made with hot sauce but she walked me through the menu to show me what I could eat. I got a breakfast combo with eggs, grits and bacon; my husband got the omelette. \n\nThe eggs were OK but the grits.... these are not run of the mill grits that are instant. These are the grits that I had when I first fell in love with them in September 2001, also in Louisiana (Shreveport). Fluffy yet smooth with a slight hint of butter. So delicious I ate my husband's portion. Diet be damned!\n\nService was very quick and just delightful. My husband left his camera on the table and she chased after us to return it. \n\nWe will go back again later this weekend. I don't care if I should experience more of New Orleans. And I am going to buy a T-shirt. And yes, I am fan girling all over this place.",

On cold nights I've sat upstairs which has a bar and feels like a beautiful lodge with the tall ceilings!\n\nAnd on those warm nights I've sat around the mismatched tables listening to live music, relaxing with friends while trying a new white wine, cheese, and small plate. I really can't think of a better way to spend an evening besides relaxing by candlelight and various white lights with friends and loved ones around. If you know me well you know that I can be very territorial and if I like a place I will NEVER take a date there bc I consider it mine! And bacchanal is that kind of place! Hehe it feels like a little piece of heaven right here in NOLA. \n\nThe people that work here really know their libations and will pair your tastes for the perfect cheese, tasting plate etc. I have brought various kind of friends and even the one that went to culinary school at Johnson and Wales and used to work at Emeril's was impressed with their wine selection. In fact we selected a wine that he said he couldn't find anywhere else in NOLA. Score one for bacchanal! He was also impressed by their small plates and the homemade concoctions in the bar upstairs!\n\nSo if you want to relax somewhere and be amongst friends then come over to Bacchanal. You won't regret it! As other reviews have said this is like being in a friend's backyard. It's eclectic, homey, and endearing like the Bywater always is!\n\nHappy carpe noctum!",

Because this is definitely a place I want to visit regularly.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nEver since missing the Yelp event hosted here, I have had it on my list to check this place out. My first experience was very brief as I found out he did not receive his shipments in due to the threat of a hurricane, so he was out of all fresh food from the deli. Of course, this was totally understandable, but I do wish there was some kind of posting on social media about that because I even checked their Facebook page ahead of time to confirm that they were open.\n\nBut I waited a couple of weeks and returned. There were a few sandwich options but I was told that the menu would be changing in a few days, so I'm not sure what's currently available as I type this out. I opted for a Cuban sandwich and browsed the products while I waited.\n\nThis Cuban was just a bit different than any other that I've had. I think the main difference is that it was only moderately pressed, which left some softness to the bread and did not completely melt the cheese to act as an adhesive to hold everything together. While I was a bit thrown off by that at first, I came to realize how much I enjoyed the sandwich as I continued to eat it. \n\nI also was able to buy a few local brews here. I love Pumpkin Beer and picked up some cans from Brew Bus, Big Top and Tampa Bay Brewing Company. They pretty much have every single canned beer made in the Tampa Bay area here, so you any beer lovers will be all set with this selection.\n\nFor all the delicious snacks in here, I do wish that there were some chips available. That was the only thing missing with my sandwich, but the sandwich itself was a home run.\n\nOn my next visit, I ordered a pizza with prosciutto and mozzarella, which was enjoyable, but I liked the Cuban Sandwich even more. There are a couple other sandwiches on the menu that I would like to try on future visits.",

It mostly irks me, though I think in crowded movies it's nice to be able to reserve in advance.

When we walked in I automatically was drawn to their displays and all of the different book selections. I enjoyed their book display on local authors and books about Nashville, so I selected a book by a radio DJ in Nashville Bobby Bones which I really enjoyed and never would've thought to read otherwise. After all, that is what bookstores are great for is discovering new books! \n\nI came back to Parnassus with a coworker once I saw that they have book signing events.  I was shocked that a noticed a few authors of very popular novels had book signings here. I decided to come here to have Delia Owens sign my copy of her book 'Where the Crawdads Sing'. Although I know that some book signings are ticketed events, no tickets were required for this one. They do ask that if you come to a book signing that you purchase the book from their bookstore, which makes sense. I was definitely grateful they had two employees going around with post-it notes so that your spelling of the name would be corrected once the author got to sign your book. One of the employees also took photos of us and the author which was nice and efficient. \n\nParnassus is a great local bookstore and I am so glad that I discovered it.

The dazzling dessert to finish it off was the milk chocolate + hazelnut pudding served with salted caramel and coffee to melt the chocolate, and candied almonds on the side. A bottle of wine for the table as well. Food was great, waiter was awesome (making sure to warn me that the risotto came in ball form rather than a bowl, for instance), very classy experience.",

Probably one of the smallest brewers in Reno and glad to be able to support them\n\nFood\n  Drinks - I want to try something I had not had before from Stoneyhead and the Honey Porter was calling me.  A solid choice.\n\nService - Brad was working behind the bar.  I placed my order he is wait I have a sample for you.  They rolled out their new beer Spring Fling.  A good ESB but was craving that porter.\n\nFuture - Sure.",

I have to say I enjoyed getting my hands dirty...\n\nThe wedge salad is worth ordering! It has a wonderful lite dressing, blue cheese, bacon, and cherry tomatoes. Yummy! \n\nI also have to say they serve a mean Bloody Mary!",

I haven't had the chance to try any other desserts or sandwiches here, but based on the reviews I came in to pick up a cake for my son's birthday. \n\nBased on cake alone I have to give it 3 stars. It's a decent cake, but I'm not crazy about these kinds of cakes. These cakes are gritty. I like my cake silky, if that makes sense. Being married to a Dominican he has a taste for these gritty cakes that's nostalgic to him because Dominican Cake (bizcocho) is gritty...as well as the merengue icing. Not that it's bad, I just prefer a soft, silky, moist cake. \n\nI will say that the cakes that I tried, lemon and guava were moist. The Lemon didn't taste as lemony as I would have expected it to. The guava was just okay. Again, not my style of cake. These were bundt cakes. I prefer the bundt cake from the popular chain over on Dale Mabry. In comparison those bundts are more my style.",

Sure, you're right there on the edge of the quarter, but if what you're really after is a few comfortable winks and one of the more unusual hotel bars going, this place has both in spades. \nBe careful where you set things down in the bar: it rotates (\"a helluva trick to play on a man,\" the recent Esquire article said that name-checked this watering hole as one of the US' great bars). \n\nAll in all though, my room was comfy, the amenities cool (if not expansive), and the staff was largely friendly and helpful. Worth noting that if you drive in, parking is thirty bucks a day...but I got such a deal on the room (they've been running a summer special during slow season) that it was easily still worth it to camp here. I'd definitely stay here again.",

  "text": "Completed in Montgomery County in 2015, Pennypack Trail is actually 16 miles long (5.4 mi. in Montco), and part of the much larger trail network in eastern PA. In fact, the section extending into Bucks County reaches the Delaware River and connects with the East Coast Greenway which runs 3,000 miles from Maine to Florida. So, if you want a long hike, you can have one. \n\nThe portion I was on yesterday was the border of Lorimer Park that was historically the railroad right of way since the 1860s, when first the Philadelphia Montgomery County Railroad Co., followed by the Philadelphia Newtown New York Railroad and finally the Newtown Branch of the Reading R&R used it to transport people and produce before highways took their place. SEPTA had it last and suspended commuter transportation (Fox Chase - Newtown Line) in 1983, and donated it to the Rails to Trails Project. \n\nWhile we all love a scenic walk, it sure would be nice to have mass transit available to get us from our bedroom communities to the heart of the city more conveniently, and redevelop the termini and old stations along the route for small commerce, too. There should be a way to have both more green space and village like economies working in tandem to attract people. Vision and capital are all that are required. \n\nStill, the Trail is a beautiful route for nature and scenic lovers as it is, and can be enjoyed in almost any weather. Walking along the heights above Pennypack Creek and watching the water course through the steep ravine cut out by erosion over eons of time, is remarkable. In the 18th and 19th Centuries many mills were busy using water wheels to grind flour, which was transported by the nearby rails to cities for further production and consumption. Some of those old structures are still there (mostly in ruins), and the stone houses built near to them were often maintained and are lived in today. \n\nHiking further, the Bethayres Swamp beckons, with Audubon designation as an IBA - Important Bird Area. The trail goes through the town of Bryn Athyn, where the original train station has been repurposed as the local post office. Just beyond that is the site of a major head-on train collision in 1921, that killed many passengers. Not all the trail is smooth for bike riding, nor easy strolling, but with effort, grit and good footwear, these places can be reached, explored and fancied.\n\nThe Pennypack Watershed is an ecological zone with long human history in the Philadelphia area. It is well worth sustaining and maintaining, even with reasonable respect for progress and our shared future.",

Desire's sister restaurant, Begue's, was my family and friends' favorite brunch in New Orleans.  And for years it was a well kept secret: $30 for bottomless champagne, an amazing creole buffet and a beautiful dining room over looking the Royal Sonesta's verdant courtyard (this unusual oasis actually has orange trees (!!!) and one drunken Thanksgiving a friend won a bet that they were real by scaling eight feet, in high heels and her best Chanel, to pick one - the little old ladies in hats and familial wait staff gave her a standing O when she alit, prize foisted). But Begue's became a victim of its hubris, raised prices to almost $50, chased off the locals and closed with a whimper.  Thank goodness they didn't ruin Desire!

  "text": "Welcome to Reno. Land of all-you-can-eat sushi, apparently. I'm told that's just how things work here, and this was my baptism into the religion of fish aplenty. Well--that's not entirely true. I once went to a Chinese buffet that served sushi. That ended not well. But I've never been to a place where you just keep ordering the things and they just keep making the things.\n\nSo we sauntered in rather late, and bellied up to the bar. The place was kind quiet on a Wednesday night, but when you want the attention of the dude making your bottomless sushi, that's a good thing.\n\nFirst up, was a bunch of nigiri. Now, for me, this is where the genius of AYCE comes in. Nigiri is the bee's knees, but I don't often order it because it doesn't make the economical sense that a roll does, in terms of bangs and bucks. But if you get a roll here, you're saddled with all the pieces. Nigiri, though, is a couple of pieces of glorious simple sushi. And so the simple sushi began. They also have specialty nigiri, which is a little more fancy, but still one bite wonders. \n\nI'm not under any illusions that an AYCE can make their money on the toppest of shelf fish, but I'm here to say that my expectations were exceeded by their fish. Each one had its own flavor (holla at me, hamachi and escolar!) and the specialty pieces had enough razzmatazz to keep me interested but be true to the fish. Also, on a total side note, can you imagine my complete surprise just now when I wrote razzmatazz and it didn't get autocorrected? Apparently it's a real word. I digress...\n\nI did try a few rolls, and I wish I could remember what ones. Good ones, I think? I know the Rainbow Roll was one, because I'm a little boring but it's a sure fave of mine. To end the night, I got the dessert roll with mango. I mean, it's all good stuff, but the disconnect between regular sushi and dessert sushi is a bit much in my mind; your mouth doesn't expect it and it tripped out my tastebuds.\n\nThe service was fire. I mean, the dude was RIGHT THERE and we just casually mentioned wanting something and boom, it appeared. I know this can't be the case on a hoppin' busy night, but whereas I had imagined slow service to slow your (sushi) roll, I couldn't have been more wrong. We were there well after closing and they kept serving. Sorry about that... but once everything was cleaned we skedaddled. Side note, skedaddled is also a legit word!\n\nWhat a way to eat, Reno. I'm into it. And Kei does a fine, fine job.",

  "text": "What an AMAZING occurrence that we ended up here after another barbecue place ran out of food!\n\nSo yeah, we started out at another spot and they were out of food when we got there. Super bummed and still in the mood for barbecue, we started wandering around Mid City and my trusty Yelp app guided me to this place. We were greeted by the super nice woman working the counter and she explained the whole process.\n\nI decided to get the one-meat plate with \"wet\" pulled pork, grits and potato salad, I also got a medium mac and cheese, because I can. My boyfriend got the two-meat plate with brisket and pulled chicken with potato salad and fries. The food blew us both away! It was delicious from beginning to end. The pulled pork was perfect and had the perfect amount of sauce without being drenched. I could tell that if I hadn't ordered it wet it still would have been able to stand on it's own. The mac and cheese was incredible, and after the pork, was my favorite part of the meal. The stone ground grits had a different type of flavor (almost smoky) that I enjoyed and the potato salad was served cold and had that nice crunch that I like in potato salad,\n\nWe both agreed that the food was excellent, and a good deal to boot, and that we would both make the trip back out to Earhart, just to have more of this delicious food. The owner himself was bringing the food out to folks and he was really friendly and made sure that we were happy with everything. I like when the owners take the time to make sure that everything is okay. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable and the entire process was a breeze. I will definitely return to LA Smokehouse and I'll be adding it to my \"BBQ Favorites\" list for future reference.",

So when I come here, I have to expect to eat more than I'm comfortable with to get my money's worth.  However, for my husband, who is a huge eater, this is a good deal.  Therefore, this is a place we'll come to when we are both super hungry, but otherwise I won't be able to eat enough to make it worth it.\n\nAt 7 p.m. on a Friday it was completely packed.  We got the last table!  By the time we left at about 8 p.m. there were tables open again.\n\nService is fast, which is great!  At the Saki in Tampa, it took forever to get more food.  Here, it came pretty quickly.\n\nMy husband started with the salad with ginger dressing.  He said next time he'd skip it.  There wasn't enough dressing.  I got the Crazy Roll and the White Dragon Roll.  I liked the Crazy Roll best.  Their rolls are on the small side, which is good since you'll want to try a bunch.  Both were pretty good, but I noticed the rolls tend to lack the sauce that usually take it to the next level at normal sushi places.  I also got the salt and pepper calamari.  It was perfectly seasoned.  I loved it, but since I had to eat the whole thing by myself, I found it a little greasy by the end.  I finished with the green tea ice cream.  It lacked a strong green tea flavor, but it wasn't bad.  My husband tried chicken, shrimp, and steak hibachi.  I found the meat dry, but he liked it.  The fried rice, wasn't bad, but you could see the bits where they missed mixing in the soy sauce.  \n\nI enjoyed how you could get 8 pieces of sashimi.  I got salmon sashimi and it was good. \n\nThis place can be very hard to find.  Luckily, I saw it off of US Hwy19 so I had a general idea of where it was.  My gps took us in the general area, but then left us to figure it out.  It sits off of US Hwy19.  As long as you know that, you should be able to find it.",

I am sure during the Spring there are lots of wildflowers. We ran across very few when we went. It mostly was just very green. The trails are marked.\n\nThe people who run the nature preserve are very nice when we met them inside the air conditioned structure. We were shown a map and various other amenities.\n\nI would just go during early Spring or Fall months. It is very hot and humid during the Summer, as Florida summers are sweltering. \n\nMake sure you bring lots of water and wear comfortable shoes.",

  "text": "I had been itching to come to Yards for a good long time now. I had heard that the brewery remakes, to the best of available knowledge, beers from the recipes of the Founding Fathers, and being a bit of a history nerd and a bit of a beer nerd, I found myself at the cross section of really needing to come down to Philly and trying the flights myself.\n\nI got three flights of them. Thomas Jefferson's ended up being my favorite, but you know, he did have some good tastes! (he would eat macaroni in front of the other FF's and they were pretty much like WTF dude why are you eating that weird trash food... but little did they know...). I found out the Poor Richard's beer was Ben Franklin's but for some legal reasons they can't say it is him (his face does appear on the bottle). I don't know why my brain fried out and didn't make the connection between Poor Richard's Almanac (written by Ben Franklin) and the beer... Ben Franklin also had like 300 nicknames/nom de plumes so it makes sense.\n\nI also ordered the saffron rice and lamb arancini to nosh on and not get overly drunk. Those were really unexpected (especially ata brewery) but I would so order them again. Really nice comforting flavor. \n\nPro tip: It's a pretty busy place. Have your party arrive all at the same time because they don't let people in, even if you are sitting at a table. Everyone has to wait on the line. I wish we knew that beforehand because some of my friends had to wait a good 20 mins (we got there a bit earlier when there was no line). \n\nI definitely plan on making the trip again! They really need to distribute their beer closer to my home ;)",

  "text": "After trying out a disappointing cupcakery in Orlando, I was happy to find this little shop in the strip mall near where I was eating lunch.  The cup cakes were fresh and lovely in her display case, each one marked with a Heart, noted a filled one. All cup cakes were $1.50 save for the canolli cup cake and that was $1.75 because it was real canolli filling and a bit more expensive to make. \n\nThe shop smells wonderful upon entering. It is a bit no frills but over all, that's fine. It's the product that you're looking for. The cup cakes are small, but GOOD. Moist cake, good icing, not too sweet but very tasty. The husbeast had the blueberry filled one, and he said it was amazing, I opted for the Salted Caramel cupcake and it was DELICIOUS. \n\nI will come back when I'm by this way again. This is the kind of place that needs to be heard about. They're a little off the beaten path, but well worth the journey.",

  "text": "The Cochinillo Asado meal brought me back to Segovia in Spain where they are famous for the roast suckling pig. Mmm mmm I could taste it right now, the crackly skin and the tender juicy meat. This pig needs no sauce or additional seasoning.\n\nWe specifically went to Amada for the roast suckling pig and it was well worth it. At first I had reservations. About $200+ for a half pig... We could get a whole le chon for that price and feed a party of 30 from a Filipino restaurant. But once you try the roast suckling pig, you will find that there is absolutely no contest. I choose the Cochinillo Asado hands down. \n\nIt arrived crispy and golden on a carving table complete with a personal chef who carved it away. I thought it looked tiny, it is baby after all, but after having a serving or two, I realized there was more to this pig than I had thought. Our table was left with a heaping mound of suckling pig and after six people had eaten one, two, three servings of it, a dent was barely made. Oh man your money stretches at Amada. We were all able to take home the leftovers. That's 16 lbs of pig for six people. It is no joke. I ate that pig for dinner the next day and it was just as delicious, juicy, tender, and tasty as it was the day before.\n\nThe sides are nothing to go raving about but made for a nice plate. I did enjoy the fingerling potatoes and Rosemary White Beans a lot. A tad salty and drenched with olive oil but definitely hit the spot.\n\nWe ordered the Paella Valenciana and I was gravely disappointed. The paella is a fake with strips of dry and flavorless chicken sitting on top along with toasted bread and saffron aioli. Huh? It didn't even have a crispy bottom. I am glad my request for lobster was denied. The paella is a waste of money. Stick to tapas if you feel that your suckling pig meal will be lacking. If not for the paella, I would have given Amada 5 stars.\n\nThe sangria was great. Have a drink at the bar while you're waiting and bring the pitcher to your table when ready. The atmosphere is young and hip, very lively. Definitely a fun spot for family and friends.\n\nWe actually closed down Amada and got kicked out of the restaurant for lingering too long. Ah, who said weekends in Philly are not fun?",

There is limited paid street parking available 8am-12am. Big Ray's restaurant is all outdoors with some overhead shade and is dog friendly. The overhead shade is not enough to shield from any rain. \n\nBig Rays Fish Camp & Grille Riverwalk serves Grouper Reubens, Grouper Sandwiches, 1/2 lb cheeseburgers, Cuban Sandwiches, Pulled Pork Sandwiches, Hot Chicken Sandwiches, Blackened Shrimp Sandwiches, Oyster Po Boys, Yucca with Blackened Shrimp, Lobster Corn Dogs, Shrimp Corn Dogs, Shrimp Po Boys, Fried Shrimp Baskets, Wings, Grilled Cheese, Chicken Fenders, smoked fish dip, U-Peel em Shrimp, Conch Fritters, Grouper Nuggets, Onion Rings.\n\nDon't come if you are in a rush!  It took 20 minutes for a server to come to our table so we could place an order and it takes another 20 minutes to flag down a server to close out your bill when you finish the meal. It seems that Big Ray's Fish Camp is only willing to provide food runners while Sail Pavilion has to provide the servers and they're already short staffed and not known for speed of service. There were 8 tables of patrons and only 1 shared Sail Pavilion server and everyone was trying to get a hold of a server to order another drink, place an order, or close out an order and the server was nowhere to be found! After quite some time, by the time the server got to our table, the server said we have to walk up to the bar and close out our bill at the bar. When I got to the bar, there was a line of people waiting to order drinks and it took another 10 minutes to close out my order.\n\nI got Big Ray's 1/2 lb Camp Burger medium rare with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, sautéed onions, camp sauce, with garlic parmesan fries. The burger was very large, the patty was thick and juicy, the burger was not overcooked, and it came with a large portion of fries.\n\nMy buddy got the blackened Grouper Sandwich with lettuce tomato onion tartar sauce with garlic parmesan fries and was also pretty pleased with his meal.\n\nIf you order any drinks, those are provided by the neighboring bar, Sail Pavilion. \n\nBig Ray's Fish Camp management needs to provide dedicated servers. The food runners are just standing around talking waiting for food to come out from the grill. I don't see why the food runners can't full-fill the role of servers taking orders and closing out bills while they are there. I really hope that management can improve the speed of service at this location because the food is actually pretty good and I wouldn't mind coming back again if it doesn't take forever to order and close.",

  "text": "This is a review of the highly regarded Townsend Restaurant during a Restaurant Week meal here.  I can certainly see glimpses in the food of why restaurant critics have been very positive but based on my experience I can only give it a middle-of-the-road assessment.  Basically the food quality is excellent - if only there were just a little more of it.  I know I am one that has often been critical of restaurants in America serving too much food but here is one that serves too little. I get it that Townsend is haute cuisine and portions are on the small side (or you won't be taken seriously as a gourmet restaurant) but you probably need to go outside Restaurant Week and spend even more money to enjoy their taster's menu of 5 or 6 courses to feel like you have had a meal here.  A lady at a table on the other side of the room was on her mobile phone and told whomever she was speaking with that she had stopped for a snack on Passyunk Avenue.  I had to laugh when a Restaurant Week dinner is called a 'snack' but that's what it kind of is.(An expensive snack though!) I have lived in Provence in the south of France and though I probably have never eaten in one of the Michelin's starred restaurants, of course I ate out many times and in many awesome places and I don't remember portions like this.  The first course was a Roasted Squash soup which I didn't know was soup when I ordered it because 'soup' was not written on the menu. One of the two girls at the table next to me also didn't realize she was ordering soup when she chose the roasted squash appetizer.  C'mon - is it some kind of trend that you can't write the word soup on a menu?  The soup was fine - all 7 or 8 spoonfuls of it. It reminded me of a roasted pumpkin soup in Vienna but it was not quite as tasty or filling. The bread course was good especially with the addition of a pepper dipping sauce. The main course was a vegetable risotto that was most delicious and very small.  It would have been such a nice gesture - especially during restaurant week just to increase the portion even by 50%.  A wonderful Huckleberry cobbler completed the meal.  Service was cordial and efficient throughout dinner although I didn't really need to re-hear the list of ingredients of each dish that I ordered when it was served as I had just read them on the menu.  \n\nI can imagine Townsend would be a great restaurant to go to when money was no object and you could indulge in more courses than three and try out some of their wines. However if you're searching for an opportunity to try out a fine restaurant during Restaurant Week and getting value for money, I'd look elsewhere!\n\nTip - Be aware that an appetizer and an entrée on Townsend's Restaurant Week menu incur a surcharge leaving only two food choices in each category for the original $35 charge. Many Restaurant Weeks around the world prohibit upselling on their special menus but obviously the Passyunk Avenue Restaurant Week does not.",

Because it was a solid experience.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI knew that the fried pork sandwich was the main event, but I was too tempted by the Philly Cheesesteak with the picture of Geno's in Philadelphia on the menu next to it.  Luckily, my friend got the fried pork sandwich, so I was able to try both.\n\nBoth items were really great.  The cheesesteak did not taste like Geno's, but it was really good.  I expected it to be closer to the original cheeseteak king because the menu mentioned that included cheese whiz, but it seemed to be much greasier than Geno's. \n\nThe fried pork sandwich was really good and definitely unique.  It came with a spicy sauce, that apparently had an even spicier version as an option.  We were told by our server that the fried pork sandwich was going to be on some kind of food network show for spicy foods.  My friend got the more mild version though, and it was delicious.\n\nI will definitely go back to EATS!",

  "text": "As Nashville continues its Los Angelesification, some things are inevitable.* Traffic will get worse. Home prices will increase. Ever more tourists will stop in to our friendly town in hopes of seeing famous people. More celebrity food/clothes shops will pop up. Sprinkles belongs to the last category (and sits next to another one). When Candace Nelson changed the cupcake world forever, she wasn't messing around. These cupcakes were huge, had interesting flavors, addictive icing, and managed to be gourmet, chic and accessible all at the same time. I don't know how she did it, but she did it. She created an empire.\n\nI first discovered Sprinkles back when I lived in Chicago. When it popped up in the Gold Coast, I had some doubts but the first bite made me a believer. When it popped up in 12 South (again, great location scouting), I was thrilled to check out the opening and fill my belly with all sort of cupcake (and ice cream!) wonders. I was so so happy.\n\nAnd then I developed a gluten issue.\n\nFor a fatty who loves cake, brownies and beer, this is definitely no bueno. There have been a lot of businesses I have had to say good-bye to in the time that's passed since my body revolted against Frankengrains. But of all the sacrifices, my dessert black hole hurt the most. The sweet cut is the deepest. But it came to pass that I had a guest in town and she wanted (needed!) to check out Sprinkles. Being the consummate host, I obliged but I was already jealous of the happiness she was about to experience while I had an air sundae. We walked in and were greeted by the typical cheery Sprinkles staff (kudos to whoever hires and trains). Off-handedly, I asked if there was anything available for someone gluten-free. I expected a 'oh, poor you' face, head tilt and a no. I received a 'yes.' Wait. What?? There was a gluten-free red velvet cupcake I could go to town on or I could avail myself of the chocolate chip cookies. Even better: I could get either (or, both) with ice cream.\n\nStaahhhhpppp it. This changes everything. Sprinkles is back in play? Game on. I ordered a chocolate chip sandwich with peanut butter cup ice cream. What I received was a gargantuan hunk of sweet chocolatey goodness that may have changed my life. It absolutely raised my endorphins. The cookies were massive. Each cookie were much bigger than my hands and I can easily palm a basketball.** They were packed with chocolate chips, thick and had a chewy consistency that matched well with the ice cream. Not too hard. Not too soft. Just right. And the ice cream? Ridiculous. Between both cookies was a slab of creamy, rich, cup-laden peanut butter ice cream that stuck to the cookie and oozed out of the sides with every bite. To house the sandwich, it came in paper that had to be engineered by NASA. This paper never broke or wilted with the wetness of the ice cream. Nor did it leech cold on to my hand. The spoon I had to help each the sandwich came into its own once the cookies were gone and I could scoop out the leftover ice cream IN THE PAPER THAT HAD THE PROPERTIES OF A CUP. I'm telling you: NASA.\n\nThis gluten-free happiness changes everything. Everything. For those of you who can tolerate gluten without issue, you have no excuse. Sprinkles is your jam. Cupcakes, ice cream and cookies... what are you waiting for? \n\n*Can an increase in TV/film production be one of them?\n**DM me.",

While I was eye-balling the El Ultimo, my wife peer pressured me into getting a Cuban sandwich. I've pressured her into ordering what I want to try, many times in the past, so I obliged. Plus, I'm never upset when \"forced\" to eat a Cuban sammy.\n\nBut then I got a little crazy and also ordered chicarones and the guava & cheese empanadas. Not to mention, yuca fries on the side with my Cuban. I don't have a lot of self-control.\n\nUltimately, it was probably a bit too much fried food for one sitting. If I could have gone back, I probably wouldn't have ordered the chicarones. They were a-okay, but probably not worth ordering again. My wife loved the dessert empanadas, while I thought they were pretty solid. \n\nI think we shared the same opinion on the Cuban sandwich that we did on the empanadas. She seemed to really love it, while I thought it pretty tasty. I like when all of the meat in the middle is at least warm, rather than the outside of the bread being toasted, with a colder center. Maybe that violates some kind of traditional Cuban laws, but I just enjoy a consistency in temperature. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it though! And I actually really loved the yuca fries!\n\nWhile I'm still working to make my way around to every HPM vendor, I really want to return to Hemingway's for that steak sandwich!",

They can be a little pricey, but sometimes you've gotta come out of pocket for the harder things to find.  Plus, the customer service is always quick and friendly.  It looks as if there is a rehab center that takes up about half of the pharmacy, so it can get pretty busy sometimes during the week around lunch.  I suggest hitting them up either early in the AM or after 4 PM.",

They even have national partnerships with haircare products to send ladies home with all of the necessities. Their location on Meridian Street makes them easy to locate and parking alongside the building makes dropping off donations easy. Note: by appointment only. I highly recommend lending your skills and excess professional accessories/attire to this fantastic organization. Hoping I can find more time to contribute more to their work.",

  "text": "I don't remember Meltkraft being here when I first visited Reading Terminal several years ago, but it's definitely a welcome addition to the market. Back at the opposite side of the 12th Street entrances (i.e. walk in from 12th Street and go straight to the back) and close to Arch, Meltkraft is part of Valley Shepherd Creamery, which makes some pretty solid cheeses (and does a bit of work on-site here as well). The ladies at the register were quite friendly and helpful in giving us advice on what to try. We ended up going with the Fresh Mozz, which, even though it's not grilled cheese, is still a phenomenal sandwich. Freshly-stretched mozzarella tastes really good with the Jersey tomatoes by itself, but definitely add the prosciutto - which adds a light meaty presence to the sandwich - and even more importantly, a dash of truffle oil, which really brings out the flavors of the whole sandwich along with its distinctive flavor. The baguette is fresh, so you're not stuck taking crunchy bites the whole time. The salt and vinegar chips served on the side are a good complement to the sandwich; they're lighter than your average chip, which is good considering you're eating a pretty thick sandwich.\n\nWhile the price was a bit high - the sandwich itself came out to nearly $10, and the Fresh Mozz is relatively small (the two sandwich slices doesn't appear to take up an entire baguette) - it was really delicious. I'd definitely like to come back again and try out their grilled cheeses, which, at least on the menu, also look great. Highly recommended if you're hankering for a cheese-themed sandwich, grilled or otherwise!",

I applaud that the place is providing a need for the community and provides dairy free and gluten free products for those who have allergies or have decided they don't want those things in their food.  But as a guy who has been eating baked goods for nearly 60 years, I have to admit that the taste of some items came across as kind of funky to me.  \n\nI bought a chocolate chip cookie and that was crisp and tasted pretty good.  I also snapped up a discounted day old lemon cupcake that had a delicious, creamy icing. The cake part was a tad dry, but that was kind of expected since the manager informed me about it being a day old before I made the purchase (hey, a cupcake for a $1 is a good deal!)\n\nThe peanut butter brownie was the one that I wasn't a fan of.  The brownie was very moist and gooey and the topping had large pieces of nut along with the creamier topping.  But the flavor just didn't come close to what I imagined in my mind.  Maybe it was an off batch, but it was probably more that some ingredients were substituted for those I like.  \n\nStill, two out of three is pretty good.  I hope the place does well, it's just not the first bakery I would go to if I wanted to pick up something to snack on.\n\nReview #945",

No kidding! Sounds too good to be true, right? \n\nThis is precisely why I had to venture out to Belle Meade for my veg sushi fix... well that is until I saw the fantastic lunch bento box deal at $6.95. Everything from the 4 pieces of sushi to the salad, miso soup, tempura, and rice were excellent. The portions were just right but the standout was the miso soup! You may not think that miso is very exciting but I appreciated the big chunks of shitake mushrooms and robust flavor. Yum in the tum. \n\nDon't judge this book by it's cover either. From the exterior, Ninki is nestled inside a dated strip mall but when you walk through the doors, it is a spacious and dark place to relax and enjoy tasty but affordable Asian cuisine. \nIf you're planning a dinner for a large group or a dinner party, the space has a couple of private areas that accommodate and there appears to be some flexibility in the layout of the space. \n\nI will definitely come back to Ninki but on my next trip, I will try the deeply discounted rolls instead.

And overall the game gave me the chance to enjoy and experience the bulk of what our stadium had to offer.\n\nWe were in the Nosebleed section which is something that I thought was going to be extremely awful. But in all actuality they managed to provide a much better view then I expected. And the jumbotron was especially exciting. I had a good laugh of the extent that some people went to just to get on it. the majority of the beer and food were what you'd generally expect from a ball park - $6-7 Budweiser and over priced chicken fingers. But it also did hook up a minuscule amount of better options if you looked in the right places. And it goes without saying that it hooked up an impressive amount of Phillies memorabilia. Overall it may never have the mystique that The Vet had. But it definitely has plenty to make it the new kind of classic.",

  "text": "Butcher & Bee is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Nashville. If you're a foodie and/or a hipster, forgo the meat and three and BBQ and meander over to East Nashville for a dining experience. Here's why I loved Butcher & Bee:\n\n1) The food- It's a small plate concept with the majority of dishes being vegetable based (though they do have some meat options). My friend and I ordered four small plates and a dessert to share and we left content. A few stand outs: The whipped feta is their signature. It is good, but if you don't like feta to begin with, order something else. Avocado crispy rice- It's more salad with a whole avocado mixed in and crunch North Carolina rice. Butternut squash soup- Bold flavors with a pomegranate seed garnish. Meat balls- comes in a triad and has cheese and bread crumbs mixed in. The chocolate pot de creme with chili was good, but not sweet (In case you're obsessed with sugar like me).\n\n2) The atmosphere- It's slick and the simple art around the restaurant is perfectly placed. We sat at the small table in front of their logo painted on the wall and several Instagrammers stopped by to snap a photo. Warning: The light is low so it doesn't make for the best photos.\n\n3) The location- It's just off of Main Street in East Nashville within walking distance to other Nashville finds like Edley's BBQ and Family Wash. \n\n4) The service- It's the South so it was friendly, but not in a fake or annoying way.\n\nIf you want a good Nashville dining experience that's on the cutting edge of Nashville's food scene pivot, go to Butcher and Bee. Just don't Google it because you'll find it's NOT a local joint (It's from Charleston, South Carolina).",

That might have everything to do with the bald headed, tattooed, pierced bartender that is from Dallas.  But this bar was a great stop from the crowded bars on Bourbon Street.  When in Rome...  we had to order the grenade drink which is some fruity electric green drink served in some ridiculous plastic glass with a tiny grenade on top.  Too fun!\n\nWe had a good time chatting up the bartender.  Then low and behold a great blues band came in and played.  I could have listened to those guys all night.\n\nThis bar is definitely on my places to revisit next time I'm in the big easy.",

  "text": "Main Street USA is alive and well at Alpine Lock and Key. \n\nWhat do I mean? Well, in small towns you could walk the Main Street and find everything you needed, products and services, and you probably knew all of the shop owners too. Shop owners legitimately cared for their customers, and made sure to take great care of each one, especially those  frustrated, in a bit of distress, or the obviously new faces coming through their door. We all know the image of the mechanic walking out of the service station to help someone broke down on the highway or the inn keeper that offers the room and hospitality to the downtrodden traveller, and that's what I'm talking about.\n\nWell I was a new frustrated face when I walked into Alpine the first time. Id gone to three typical places to get a key copied in the last month only to come up empty handed each time. The thought occurred to me that visiting a locksmith would likely solve my problem. But who goes to a locksmith? To me, that's a mobile service I call in a pinch. Brick and mortar? It was my only option.\n\nI'd remembered Alpine as a recommendation from a friend and as a nice shop I passed all the time on Ryland. Timing finally worked out, and I had the key with me and remembered to stop by Alpine while in the area. \n\nWhen I walked in I was surprised by all the retail goods they had, including safes, lock boxes, keychains and all kinds of hide-a-keys too. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I can say that it exceeded whatever expectations I had, and I was really happy to be supporting this local business. Behind the counter the phones kept ringing, and you could see the pros coming from and going to jobs. \n\nI was greeted, told the gentleman my issues, handed him the key, asked for 4 copies, and watched as he quickly grabbed the blanks, turned the keys, and handed them back to me. When I went to pay, he just said \"Thank You\". \n\nI was blown away. This person legitimately just wanted to help me solve this problem I had, and now, any time I need a key or the like, I know where I'm heading. In fact I went back a month later and had a few more keys cut! \n\nI know key blanks are really cheap, but I also know it takes a while to learn this trade, and time is money. I wanted to pay, but he just wanted to help. I won't forget this experience or the way Alpine values their customers. It's truly nice to know there are still kind hearted tradespeople out there that just want to help.",

  "text": "The hot pot scene in Edmonton has been bubbling up over the past few years with several restaurants opening up in succession but things seem to have finally settled down. The main players, 97 Hot Pot and Asian Express Hot Pot, are located in Chinatown with Chili Hot Pot just off of Whyte Ave. Okay, Asian Express has a second location south side if you want to get all technical on me. Rounding things out, there's Kings Noodle & Hot Pot, Bangkok Restaurant and BoBo Hot Pot Restaurant.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of hot pot (AYCE once every 6-9 months is more than enough for me) but a sweet Groupon deal ($70.00 for 4 people) couldn't be passed up. After holding onto the coupon for a couple of months, we finally made our way over to Urban Shabu to use it with the deadline fast approaching. Always seems to be the case when you buy one, eh?\n\nThree bros and I arrived at 7:00pm on a Thursday evening. It was L's first time ever having hot pot so we eased him into the process. The inside is spacious and what I really liked about Urban Shabu (besides their hilariously random signage) was their ventilation system. Yes, you will smell like hot pot before/during/after your meal but that's a given. Regular price is $27.95/person for all you can eat dinner, $2.00 extra for specialty soup broths (chicken broth is free) and $3.00 if you want half/half. They have a solid lunch deal ($11.95), which I believe is similar to 97's deal. There's even a parking lot in the back aka. two ways to get into the restaurant.\n\nWe each ordered a different broth - I went with the HK style satay. Not too satay-ish but it was good enough. I wasn't in a super spicy mood so it worked for me. The sauce station is pretty standard while the ordering system is guess, wait and see, which always seems to be the case when you go for hot pot. Just order more the next round to compensate!\n\n- Good stuff: lamb, beef, enoki mushrooms, bok choy, fried bean curd (try it if you've never had it before. It soaks up all the flavours in your broth.), lamb mash, quail eggs and noodles.\n\n- Meh stuff: beef brisket (weird odd looking pieces, not what we were expecting), green onion and spring rolls (dry, luke warm. Skip out on the fried crap).\n\n- Japanese style sesame balls, mango tapioca, soft tofu, vanilla ice cream and osmanthus jelly cake - we were stuffed silly but obviously, we ordered dessert. There's five different items to choose from and we decided to try them all. Ridiculous. Mango tapioca was probably the best but the osmanthus jelly and soft tofu were close runner ups. The ice cream was pretty standard although I found it a bit too artificial tasting while the Japanese balls were luke warm and glutinous.\n\nDon't be afraid to try something new. There's a ton of items to choose from so you might as well make the most of it! For the most part, everything was pretty good except for the fried items that we ordered. Price wise, it's pretty standard AYCE fare. My advice: go during lunch. Your wallet and belly will both be happy campers.",

  "text": "I have gotten pho to-go a few times here, as it's an easy stop on my way home from work. I have thought the pho was fine. Not amazing, not memorable, but it hit the spot when the pho craving grabbed me.\n\nWe ate in the restaurant on Saturday night, and again, it was just fine. We tried the Bò 7 món (7 Course of Beef Dinner).  I have had this at a restaurant in Pinellas County, and while that experience was definitely a 5/5 Star experience, this was only a 3/5 Star. When we arrived, we were the only people in the place, but service was still slow. They also forgot a drink we ordered, but we just ended up cancelling it.    \n\nTo start with, they brought out our burner of oil, the first course of beef, and the wraps - but not the vegetables to put into the wrap.  That took a good five more minutes to come out. Things did progress pretty quickly after that, though, with the other courses coming in a timely manner.  We did the meal for \"3\", and some of the courses I thought they were pretty skimpy for 3 people. Of all the courses, I would say my favorites were the grilled beef wrapped like a sausage, and the beef congee at the end of the meal.\n\nThey also screwed up my credit card payment at the end of the meal (and ended up hand-writing it in, which is sketchy at best).  I'm sure I'll be back for some to-go pho, but I'm still on my quest for a good Bò 7 món in the Tampa area.",

I couldn't remember the last time I tried it since I was never the biggest fan back then so I figured I'd go in with an open mind and see how they've evolved.\n\nIt's safe to say the space itself has not evolved. It looks exactly the same as it did years ago. But the food seemed to get better or perhaps my taste buds were just more refined..? I ordered a lasagna dish and it was pretty good, but my mom's bowtie something pasta (sorry I forget!) was the star of the table. It had spices and olive oil and it was just really nicely prepared all around. I ordered tiramisu to go, which was also a quality item.\n\nIn terms of Gloucester County's Italian restaurants, I'd say this is a good met for a nice meal.

  "text": "HotBox Pizza is a 17-location Indiana chain of pizza joints that seems to flourish amongst the young adult and college crowd. As is true for most pizza joints, they offer in-house dining, carry-out and delivery within specified areas. They also offer catering and have some fund-raising options. As I don't live within the delivery range for any location, I've only experienced their dine-in option at a couple different locations. \n\nIf you're familiar with Broad Ripple, then you already know the basics. HotBox Pizza is a \"I'm drunk and need to sober up before driving home\" kind of joint, because Broad Ripple has sort of a strong police presence and DUI's are more expensive than pizza pies. \n\nHotBox isn't and really doesn't claim to be \"gourmet\" pizza. I've never disliked a pizza from HotBox, but I've also never been blown away  by one. They offer the usual toppings, the usual options and fair prices. The decor is always, or at least for the places I've seen, in sort of a red/black interior that feels comfortable but doesn't really push any personality. \n\nAs I recall, they used to offer pizza-by-the-slice at this location but I don't believe that's an option anymore. They do have a lunch special called The Lunch Box that ends at 2pm - a slice, a salad, or sticks (pick two) for $5.00. They also offer other pizza specials, but no real \"individual\" option after 2pm. \n\nI visited HotBox before the recent English Beat/Soul Asylum concert at the Vogue, hoping to grab a quick slice. Unfortunately, no \"slice\" was an option and I ended up ordering a small sausage pizza with a drink - the entire bill came in just over $11. They have a build-your-own option for pizza that is pretty reasonable as far as pizza goes, though I wish they'd have at least one option for an individual diner. I was not in the mood for an entire pizza, even a small one. \n\nI dined in. It didn't take long, which was the goal since I didn't have long before I needed to get in line for the concert. The crew was friendly, though I wouldn't say \"welcoming.\" My order was taken and I took up a spot at one of their tables (NOTE: the window area is not wheelchair accessible, but the rest of the place is). I did have to move a chair, but that's standard. I ordered a drink and received one of their non-disposable cups you can take with you - as I was headed to a concert, I was bummed I had to toss it. \n\nOne word of advice. HotBox only offers soft drinks other than a Hi-C fruit punch option through the fountain. As an avid iced tea drinker whose body rejects soft drinks, this is always a challenging situation. I kept with the fruit punch, but sure wish they had an iced tea option.\n\nI was amused that HotBox appears to be a location for this new Pokemon craze going on. More than once, someone came in to tag their whatever it is. I'm old. I'm unhip. I have no idea and don't particularly care, but it was fun watching otherwise hipsters come in and make fools of themselves chasing some child's game.\n\nOverall, HotBox Pizza continues to be a perfectly fine option if you're in the area. It's sure not a destination pizza joint, but it's a decent option if you're in the area and/or in their delivery area. The pizza is a fairly standard issue pizza and it's local as opposed to that godawful Papa John's crap. \n\nYou like pizza? Support 'em. Just keep your expectations in check.",

It's attached to a church, which funds it. I asked the woman who was supervising the area if there was somewhere to donate money (because I like the idea of this place existing), and she said, \"That's completely not necessary!\" The other best part is that there is a drive-thru Starbucks just down the road. Score!",

I LOVED the Dan Dan noodles (I'm a carb freak - esp pasta and noodles!) - the sauce wasn't sweet or too spicy - just uniquely perfect!  It was a really nice sized portion for an app too!  \n\nOur host gave us a great overview of the place and menu and welcomed any questions.  Our server, Alex, was super nice as well.  Both seemed to really believe in their food and restaurant whole hardheartedly, which fueled my appetite!    \n\nWe shared the 'three cup chicken,' which was good, but not crazy good like the noodles or the dumplings that we got for appetizers.  \n\nLooking forward to going back :)",

If you love wine, beer, happy hours, and chinchilla-themed anything, this is your place!\n\nMeredith, our lovely purveyor of \"great liquids\", was awesome and friendly and informative about their offerings. \n\nThey have a fantastic selection of madeiras, ports, and other wines. They also offer an array of draught beers. \n\nBe sure to check-in on the app for your free pour of their Rainwater madeira (if you are new to madeiras, this is a great one to start with). \n\nThe chinchilla theme is so much fun! They have chinchilla vids playing on the TV, have the cutest shirts and masks and you can even play \"chinchilla plinko\" with a purchase of a bottle! \n\nThey do have bottles for purchase to consume on or off premises. \n\nThe inside is so clean, adorably and fashionably decorated, and there is inside, outside, and bar seating. \n\nA must-stop if you are in St Pete!",

  "text": "Here's my feedback regarding the recent 2 night stay at this resort.\n\n1) I had called your hotel on 4/19/2020 and spoke with someone (did not get the person's name, but it was male) about whether your pool was going to be open, he specifically said that the pool at the hotel is open. This is mis-information that was given to customers, as upon arrival, I was informed that the pool had been closed for 1.5 months. I chose your hotel because I thought the pool would be open, but in fact, it was closed. What a disappointment.\n2) Upon check in on 4/28/2020 morning, Michael assisted us with finding an ocean view room. When we arrived at room 30X, the ocean view is really NOT an ocean view because right outside our balcony - is the largest tree ever that blocks our entire view of the ocean. Please also note that when we arrived to our room, the floor was covered with at least 5-6 pieces of dog kibble. Makes me feel like the room was unkept and unclean. Is this how a 4-star hotel should be?\n3) I had to contact the front desk and spoke with Anna to request a room change. This was not an easy request to satisfy either, because she gave me some options such as moving over the to Eucalyptus building 2nd floor, and would not provide a specific room number. I had to personally walk over to the 2nd floor of that building, and look out at the view and realized that there were again multiple trees blocking the ocean. I had to go meet her at the front desk to request for another 3rd floor room near room 30X, and she gave me some excuses such as your hotel doesn't allow people to move rooms during their stay, and that she can't find any other rooms available on the 3rd floor, etc. Honestly, it's just a bunch of excuses and you guys are making it MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT SHOULD BE. Customers are here to enjoy, relax and spend time in a soothing environment, but all I get is a room with a partial ocean view, and NOT what I had paid for. I informed Anna to please note in my reservation that for the next morning, I would like the front desk to find me a room near 30X that doesn't have an obstructed view. I was hoping that I could at least have 1 day where my view was truly unobstructed.\nOne hour later, Anna calls me back and offers Room 30Y, which she said is open and available now. I had to go downstairs and get the keys from her so that I can FINALLY move into a true ocean view room around 4 pm. What makes this situation so odd is that Michael told me that you guys are at 20% capacity, so how can there be no rooms for me to move into with a proper ocean view room?!\n4) On 4/29/2020 morning, I am told by the front desk lady (and also Michael said the same thing at check-in) that I am able to redeem my free wine for a juice / milk at the Java corner. The Hispanic lady at the java corner (did not catch her name) refused to give me a simple milk carton, because she said she can only do \"coffee\". Then she proceeded to say that I did not have a mask on and cannot serve me. I told her that I only needed her to point out where the milk was located, and that I am NOT needing any \"serving\" by her. She was quite curt, rude, and just very poor service. I finally retrieved the milk carton on my own, and placed the wine card at the counter. This leaves a distaste in my mouth after interacting with her. Why does every interaction with your staff have to be so difficult?\n5) I am currently a Gold member with Hilton Honors, but because I used Capital One points to book this reservation, I am not awarded any Hilton Honors points, and I don't get credit for staying here for 2 nights, which don't count towards my Gold status nights accrued. This is rather disappointing. I also offered to NOT have my room serviced during my 2 nights, so that I can earn 1,000 Hilton Honors points for being \"eco-friendly\" but was told by Anna that I am not eligible. Again, a disappointment. I feel no sense of appreciation from Hilton, even though I have a Gold member status. What a joke.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this hotel and gave it a chance, even though your reviews on Yelp are so low. But now I feel like I understand why the reviews are only 2.5 stars overall on Yelp. \n\nSome things I did enjoy about your hotel are:\n- 2 hour bike rental, but this was basically covered by my resort fee\n- the fact that your location is across from the beach with easy access, but your hotel does not offer any beach umbrellas\n- there are charging ports for electric vehicles, which is essentially paid for by parking fees",

The crawfish pie was tasty and a bit small. The mac-n-cheese was rich and delicious. I appreciated that they do have vegan options since those are hard to come by with most food trucks and veggie friendly red beans n rice. \n\nIf you're trying to hunt this truck down... well good luck. It looks like he posts to his FB page once he arrives at a location, but no schedule seems to be available. And his website still lists him as being in the Northeast. I did notice that his phone number is now NOLA local, so I guess that means he's relocated back to home.",

By the way the free shows during the summer = WIN.  i can't think of a better way to lure people away from their usual ho hum routinized evenings for a rollicking good time.  \n\nSure it can get disgustingly overpacked at times, but if you stow away to the upstairs area, it's usually a little more bearable.  Plus nice aerial view of the band and crowd mashing about below.  As other Yelpers have stated, unforgivably bad dancing can usually be observed, but hey, you're probably a part of it!\n\nI recall the drinks being pretty decent and strong, the bartenders as prompt as can be expected with a packed venue.  \n\nIt's not the \"classiest\" place, but it's definitely some place that tucks away nicely in the very essence of New Orleans.

  "text": "5 STARS x 2! 10 STARS! And a HUGE KUDOS to Chef Lisa & her very friendly Army veteran brother Brian, the co-owners of this exceptional casual eatery that opened its doors in June 2020 in the midst of Covid restrictions. TRULY AMAZING fresh flavors & textures! \n\nEverything you'll eat here is prepared on site, & the blue crabs are flown in weekly. Prices are somewhat higher than you may find elsewhere, but I can pretty much guarantee you will NOT get the same level of flavor and quality elsewhere as you will here. \n\nI am almost beyond words; this restaurant SERIOUSLY SCREAMS QUALITY! The menu is jam-packed w/ so many delectable offerings-- seafood appetizers, entrees, soups, salads, sandwiches, along w/ wings & sides. There's even dessert on the menu (such as Banana Pudding & Pound Cake, providing you'll still have room in your belly).\n\nAfter much time staring at the downloaded menu (& practically drooling over the many choices), we ordered the North Ave Crab Balls (4) @ $16. They were by far the BEST CRAB BALLS (or cakes) we've ever tasted! Unlike others, upon every bite we saw & tasted fresh crab-- very little breading. SEE THE PICS! Seriously, GREAT CRAB BALLS! Our Prince George Shrimp Tacos @ $15 were Very Good-- light & flavorful (see pic). Yummy. \n\nAccording to very friendly Niki, the following menu items are extremely POPULAR: North Ave Crab Balls (Yes, ma'am!); Crab Cakes; Blue Crab Seafood Pizza; Blue Crab Nachos; Catfish Sandwich; & the Salmon Philly Cheese sandwich. \n\nThe soups sounded amazing, & we were privileged to taste samples of the daily Maryland Crab Soup & the Rockville Shrimp & Corn Chowder (available only on Saturdays). Both were EXCELLENT, although we both preferred the creamy & rich texture of the chowder. We shall have to return to order the Crab & Corn (Fridays only) & the Cream of Crab (available only on Sundays). Niki also brought us a basket of warm, fresh Blue Crab Chips to try. A simple, yet wonderful, $4 appetizer -- SEE PIC! \n\nNot into seafood? There are wings on the menu in quantities of five ($7), ten ($12); fifteen ($18) & twenty ($22). \n\nAdditional items that piqued my interest & not previously mentioned: Fish Tacos; Grilled Salmon; Crab Cake Sandwich; Soft Shelled Crab Sandwich; Blue Crab Shack Salad; Fried Shrimp & Fried Fish dinners; Shrimp Quesidias; Shrimp Po Boy (regular or spicy); Shrimp & Grits (Sunday only); & Fish & Grits (also Sunday only). I'm quite sure I omitted others that sounded & looked INCREDIBLE. (Download the menu to enjoy the vivid menu pics!) You, too, may experience great difficulty deciding what to order.\n\nInterested in taking Blue Crabs home? WEEKLY, Brian & Lisa have 200 to 400 lbs flown in from the Chesapeake area. Customers must pre-order & pay for their Crab on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday to receive them Thursday thru Sunday.\n\nHave you checked out this business's webpage? It's bright, organized, & easily navigated. Patrons may order online for easy pick-up. Catering is available. This seafood restaurant participates in fundraising; Brian & Lisa select one organization monthly to receive 15% of all net sales; use the online form to have your organization considered. \n\nDue to the small, sparse, very casual dining room (see pics), this restaurant may not be where some would want to take a love interest on a first date; however, if s/he were wanting to impress a guest by feeding him or her SUPERIOR seafood cuisine, this is the place to come-- hands down MY FAVORITE SEAFOOD EATERY IN MY FIVE YEARS ON YELP! \n\nChef Niki may not be professionally trained, but this woman can run circles around the Best of the Best! \n\nI have driven up to Nashville 3x over the past nine months. I shall drive up again-- & EACH AND EVERY TIME I will stop in to try more of Lisa's remarkable creations. Born & bred in Maryland, but here via Atlanta, she is Madison, Tennessee's (& our) win!",

We were starved from the drive and noticed a long wait to be seated.\n\nWe opted to utilize the to-go window and eat at one of the open tables on the pier. [Watch out for all the flies!!!] We ordered the bread bowl clam chowder,  the crab cake, and small soda. Total came out to be about $27.\n\nClam chowder: Disappointed with how watery it was. I always compare my chowder to the best chowder I have ever had, and that's at Pike Place Chowder in Seattle. This is nothing compared to Pikes. \n\nCrab cake: 1 cake and lacked the taste and flavor. In fact, it was rather bland. Luckily, it came with a lemon, and the lemon gave it some flavor. There were 2 onion rings that accompanied the crab cake, and the batter was the same - flavorless. Cole slaw was decent, at last.\n\nNo free refills on soda, unfortunately.\n\nThere's a parking lot on the pier, but you have to get your ticket validated. Otherwise, you have to park in the neighborhood, and walk the pier. \n\nShould you decide to eat inside, place your name immediately on the list. It may seem long, but people get antsy and leave. Be patient.  \n\nGreat view and you definitely can't believe the scenery!!!",

I'm on the fence here -- big time. I love this place. I love that it exists. I love that they opened a location basically in our neighborhood -- East End of Mass Ave -- and they serve as downtown's only choice for organic, healthy full-supply pet food. I love the owners. I love the food they have. I love the toys, the treats, the conversations, the knowledge, the location, the service, the food options, the openness to give out samples to see what our dog likes. So what is it?\n\nThe Hours. \n\nI had no idea this is what 'the hours' meant when Virgina Woolf writes to Leonard -- her husband -- \"To look life in the face. Always to look life in the face. And to know it for what it is. At last to know it is. To love it for what it is. And then to put it away. Leonard always the years between us, always the years. Always the love. Always the hours.\" \n\nYeah, I'm the yelper that quotes Virginia Woolf. \n\nHopefully I'll also quote Virginia Woof who says, \"please extend the hours of City Dogs as closing so early and opening so late leaves dog owners high and dry when in need -- especially in a pinch. Maybe just one day a week where they can rely upon the longer hours to accomplish all tasks. I mean, hey, maybe it'll create a Friday frenzy of pet owners who come to your store to hang out, purchase and party. First Fridays, even?\"",

  "text": "We stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Plymouth Meeting and really enjoyed our stay. Everyone at the hotel seemed nice, especially Kim, the lady who checked us in. Kim set the tone and was really welcoming and affable. The hotel and amenities were nice considering the tier of hotel and price paid. We were part of a wedding block and were charged $119.90 per night after taxes. Not bad.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Philadelphia, this hotel is located in the suburbs northwest of town. There's plenty of free parking and the hotel is located within walking distance of a big shopping mall, Plymouth Meeting Mall, that is anchored in part by a Whole Foods. Aside from the mall, if you don't have a car, you're going to have to Lyft/Uber to get anywhere.\n\nThis Courtyard by Marriott is four stories. Our room was 335 on the 3rd floor. It was a \"KSOF\" (king with sofa bed) room with a view of the parking lot and office building to the north. The hotel is surrounded by several office buildings so I suspect a lot of business travelers stay here to work at those buildings.\n\nFrom the outside, the hotel looks like your standard Courtyard by Marriott. Inside, it looks like some renovation work has been done. The place was clean and looked fairly modern. While there's no full-service restaurant or shop, there is a fast-casual counter where you can order made-to-order food and drinks, a small retail corner with grab-and-go items, some dining and lounge-like areas, and a business center of sorts. There's also an indoor pool, hot tub, and gym. The gym is tiny. Outside in the back is a little courtyard with nice landscaping and additional seating. It's worth exploring and checking out.\n\nWhen we checked in, Kim handed us two bottles of water and two Peanut Chews, delicious candy bars that are manufactured in Pennsylvania.\n\nOur room was clean and comfy, and contemporary in design. The toiletries, such as the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, were Paul Mitchell Tea Tree brand. The bathroom had a standard tub and shower with a floor that was tastefully tiled. The bed was very comfortable, from the soft-yet-firm mattress to the silky-smooth and smell-good sheets. There was an artsy-looking couch (sofa bed) with a conveniently-angled end table. The office desk was extendable which was great for more surface space. The TV was a smart TV with apps like Netflix and YouTube installed. There was a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, luggage rack, and hair dryer. The Wi-Fi was free and fast enough. And there was free, self-serve, tasty coffee and fruit-flavored ice water in the lobby.\n\nStandard check-in time is 3pm and check-out is 12pm. I used the Marriott Bonvoy app to keep track of my reservation and make an early check-in (12pm) request. The hotel (Kim) was quick to respond to my chat messages in the app and she remembered me from our chat conversation when I showed up in person to check-in. I like how they stay on top of that. Saturday night, when the lobby was used for the wedding after-party, I called in a request for additional toiletries and housekeeping was reasonably quick to respond despite the craziness going on downstairs. I appreciated that.\n\nOverall, I think this is a very good mid-tier hotel. I recommend it.",

  "text": "Mexican food in Indy that impresses FOUR women from Los Angeles?!?!  Yup, truth!\n\nThis review is past due but much deserved to Adam and the crew at Livery for impeccable service, WONDERFUL food, and FANTASTIC tequila and mescal drinks.\n\nAdam knows the menu!  Trust him.  He'll take care of you and pamper your whole group like your family (family he likes, that is!).  He even gave a tiny sample of dolce de leche sauce to go because I felt in love with it.  I took it back to my hotel and rubbed it on my naked body -- it was THAT good.  \n\nTry sitting up on the patio outside upstairs.  Nice weather and an arts-district soho noho vibe.  \n\nBeautiful decor.\n\nExtensive menu but I'll highlight several things...\n\nYou must try the cauliflower starter.  Oh my!  A total hit with the table.  And the cheese empanadas were divine!  \n\nFor entrees --\nMy colleagues and I also loved the Mahi mahi tacos and skirt steak but by far the winner for dinner entrees was the Portobello Tostada.  I am noooooo where near a vegetarian, but this thing was BURSTing with flavor and a hit with everyone.\n\nFor dessert--\nGet the same platter.\nBeautiful chocolate flan.\nYummy tres leches cake.\nAnd for 4 women from So Cal --- unanimous vote for best churros ever!  It was a surprise to all of us.  The dulce de leche sauce was lick-the-plate fantastic!  \n\nAlso try their version of The Cadillac Margarita - boozie and yummy!\n\nSo surprised to have such a great dining experience in the middle of Indy, but we loved it and highly recommend it to locals and travelers alike!\n\nNon appetite!",

  "text": "It's hotel food - and usually I might give a place like this 2 stars - but I am giving 3 due to VERY nice service and we lingered a very, very long time.  The main dining room was nearly empty (but the bar was hoping for happy hour) on the week night we went.\n\nA good friend of mine who is vegetarian got the pasta with goat cheese which looked very good.\n\nThe female server was superb!  Very attentive and brought us apples and nuts (with a nut cracker) to snack on.\n\nWhile there are far better choices nearby - this was a warm safe place to kill a few hours on a bitterly cold afternoon.",

They also had a nice running/bike trail.\n\nWe were attending the seafood festival and I am so glad we kicked off our shoes and walked barefoot through the grass for a while.  \n\nThe next time I come to NOLA I will spend more time here relaxing!",

  "text": "We had another restaurant in mind on Frenchmen St. After a so-so vibe at the place we were considering -- I honestly don't remember its name -- we bailed and went with a recommendation from the bartender (bah-tenduh) at Hermes Bar at Antoine's.\n\nThe place was pretty low-maintenance with a lot of cool-looking servers in hats. It seemed like a mix of tourists and locals.\n\nSince we never got the hang of ordering properly -- us Californians are used to smaller portions -- we asked for an ungodly amount of food. An enormous basket of fried okra, fried chicken, mustard greens, collared greens, mashed potatoes, and cornbread. Though the fried okra was pretty good (also seems hard to mess this up), and the sides were fantastic, the fried chicken stood out for me. That batter is insane. We didn't talk the whole way through the meal: a sign of a good one! Pralines to go made my day later on.\n\nI'd love to spend more time on Frenchmen St. -- for food, music, and bars -- next time we're in town. Nicely out of the way from Bourbon Street madness.",

  "text": "My husband and I were walking in Ybor city  just to see what's around and stopped by this place for a dessert.  \n\nWe ordered a crepe with strawberry, banana, Irish creme and Nuetella.  The guy who made our crepe was really unfriendly and pissed off for some reason.  The crepe had too much Nuetella sauce and not enough of fruits and definitely overpriced!!  I am from Japan and they sell crepes as a street food for $4-$6.  And they are usually packed with fruits.  The crepe I had here was $10 and lacked everything I was looking for in a crepe.  \n\nI did not have any non-sweet crepe here so I cannot say anything about those.  However, I have traveled the world and this place is definitely definitely not the best crepe I had.  Not even close at all.  This place could not fool me!",

  "text": "The office went again, sans the vegetarian. We all got the strip steak . . . lucious steak, a little fatty on the outer rims, but isn't that what gives it flavor? The outside grill crustiness was divine, and the steaks were all done beautifully medium rare!!\n\nSalads were great . . .various dressings: creamy Italian, bleu cheese and the Biggie's White French (similar to Thousand Island).\n\nSides: baked potato with sour cream was a massive missile of carbs, which he loved; I got lots of broccoli perfectly cooked, can't remember the other diner's side.\n\nI got a to-go vessel of the fried chicken dinner: $10 for half a chicken, and I got two sides instead of a side and a salad -- at the recommendation of our server. Evidently, Thursday and Sunday are fried chicken days! And I had that lovely specimen for dinner!!! Sadly, though, it was underseasoned . . . so, while crunchy and juicy, it was rather bland.\n\nBeyond that, I had a wonderful to-go vessel of half of my broccoli and more than half of my steak for another day! That salad was filling. Not to mention the bread!\n\nAnd I must mention that everybody is so nice here! Greeting you! Happy you're there! Fabulous service! Saying goodbye and come again!

  "text": "In my best Jeff Foxworthy voice: You might be a Westbanker if... you're excited about the new Wal Mart.\n\nOkay, so I won't say I am excited per se, but I am pretty happy that there is a Wal Mart in the 'hood that is an actual grocery store and not a super gigantic \"if you need it, we got it\" Wal Mart that they all seem to be these days. If you remember the Wal Marts of yesteryear- when life was a little simpler and you couldn't buy a gun in aisle 6, then this is the place for you.\n\nToday was the opening day, so you know I had to be first in line. Not really, but I was there at 11 to beat the impending crowd. There was still a crowd, mind you, but it was manageable. They have a nice selection of things here and it's new and clean, so I enjoyed that while it lasted. I was most impressed with the bakery section, as they had a nice selection of breakfast pastries that were well priced. I scooped up some rolls, just to say I helped the cause (does Wal Mart need my help? Nah.) The beer section isn't anything to write home about, but they do have a pretty impressive wine selection.\n\nThe lines were short, even though there was a bit of a crowd and all of the employees were working fast to get everyone in and out. Ample parking and a big parking lot made navigating the parking area a breeze. It's everything that you would expect from a typical grocery store, and while it's no Rouses, it's a nice addition to the area.",

  "text": "My husband and I visited Steak 33 and had a remarkable time. My husband really likes steaks, so I thought this would be the perfect place for our date night. First things first,we selected and enjoyed the sparkling wine. For appetizers, we chose the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake and Baked Oysters. Both were delicious, but I really enjoyed the crab cake. Remember, MAMA LOUISIANA!!! My husband got the Filet Steak. He was highly impressed with the quality. He says it was one of the best steaks in the city. I chose the poultry, which was the Daily Fish. I have photos below of the (seasoned to perfection) fish. I love, love, love the sauce on the fish. For sides, we got potatoes au grautins and creamed spinach. Even though I am a foodie, I still like to incorporate veggies when I can. The Au Gratin menu at Steak 33 is pretty extensive. You can get anything Au Gratin from Spinach, Cauliflower, Potatoes, Peas, Crabmeat, Lobster and Broccoli. We topped off our date night with a Rum Rasin bread pudding. That was just the 'creme De La creme'.  Magnificent!! \n​\nThe restaurant is located on Bourbon Street. Perfect for getting out there then grabbing a good dinner to soak up all of the drinks! The waiters were extremely helpful and accommodating to us. We will be back for the Fried Chicken Brunch in September.",

  "text": "Pacific Counter is a fairly new poke and sushi burrito shop in Downtown St. Pete. Prices are fair and will run you about $12 for a bowl or burrito. Portions are more than sufficient.\n\nI had a Golden Hour sushi burrito which is mainly made with salmon and krab. I really enjoyed the taste of the nori (seaweed) wrapper and the vibe of the place is very Polynesian with a touch of surf. I like the branding of the place. Ambiance is something places don't always get right across the bridge.\n\nI also tried their Dole whip dessert and that was also great, I'm not much of a dessert guy - but I would order it. Overall, I recommend Pacific Counter and think its a great option when that poke or sushi craving strikes in DTSP.",

  "text": "I made my first trip to this buffet after having lived in town for over six years and I will say that the food is pretty good, at least it's as good as the stuff you can buy prepackaged at the grocery (from the freezer section.)  I was surprised at how large the dining area was and how many buffet lines (five in total) were available to choose from.  But I found the staff a bit difficult to communicate with and maybe it's just a cultural thing, but they don't interact with the customers any more than the minimum.\n\nWhen I entered and let the hostess know I was by myself, I was directed to follow a server who showed me to a table.  She provided my napkins, utensils, and asked my drink order.  After bringing my drink, she then disappeared.  I have been to restaurants that have buffets as an option, but also allow you to order from a menu.  No menu here.  I've also been to buffets where they charge you by the weight of your purchase.  No scales here.  And in almost every case, the server/hostess has directed me to help myself when ready or at least asked if I had any questions.  I tried talking with the server and she thought I was asking her to get the food for me.  Again, difficulty in communicating.\n\nSo, I helped myself to one of the five buffet lines.  I started with a salad.  When I finished, I left my used plate on my table and grabbed another plate to try some Chinese foods, including the egg drop soup (help yourself to additional plates and bowls as needed.)  By the time I got back to my table, my old plate was cleared.  Yeah!\n\nWhat surprised me was that none of the other reviews have mentioned that there are quite a few American dishes to eat here:  pizza slices, fish, chicken wings, Texas toast, and a separate line devoted to desserts.  Who knew?  It appears that you can continue going to get more food until you pop or decide you've had enough.  All for under $10.  Just amazes me how people think it's too expensive. \n\nAnyway, now that I know they have a wide variety of food options and that you help yourself whenever you are ready, I would probably have a better experience on a return trip.  \n\nOh, I also recommend flagging down your server when you are ready so that she can bring your bill.  You pay at the front desk when you are finished.\n\nReview #1992",

I've unfortunately never tried the food - but every time I see it being brought out I wish I was hungry. I imagine it's a pretty great lunch stop from the looks of it.\n\nThe ATMOSPHERE at this location is great. There is tons of seating and it's super trendy inside. Good for groups, for working, or just stopping in to have a coffee with friends. There are comfy couches and a big table / work space.\n\nThe SERVICE: the people aren't overly friendly but they're not the coffee snobs you'll find at a lot of other great places around the nation. I imagine I haven't had the chance to talk to the people behind the counter much because they're always super busy.\n\nIf you've never had Buddy Brew coffee and you like cold brew I'd definitely recommend stopping it to try! It's delicious and really well done. And who doesn't love a great local coffee shop?!",

  "text": "Such a cute place, I'm disappointed in myself for not coming here sooner. \n\nI thought this was only a place where you ordered cakes for special occasions. I didn't realize you could get small desserts and coffee and eat it here! It's a really cute concept. There is very limited seating, but when we came we were the only ones in here so I think most people take stuff to go freeing up space for people who want to stay! We ended up being like most people and grabbing and going.\n\nWe went with the chocolate pound cake and a chocolate chip cookie. Both were good and satisfied my sweet tooth. The cookie was like a puck and more crunchy than soft. It had giant hunks of chocolate in it. Every bite was full of chocolate. At $3.99 it isn't an inexpensive cookie, especially because it isn't that big, but the amount of chocolate somewhat justifies the price.\n\nThe chocolate pound cake was delicious. At $5.99 that is the price I expect it to be. It was covered in a chocolate frosting. It was very moist and decadent. I almost ate the whole thing in one sitting, but I had to save some for my husband. \n\nOverall I like this place. I think it is cute and definitely worth stopping at if you have a sweet tooth and are in the area.",

  "text": "Came to Scully's on the first night down in Florida. It's a half indoor/outdoor restaurant right smack in the middle of John's Pass on the west coast. It's located right off the gulf and overlooks the water. Honestly, I prefer indoors especially during the humid weather but that night in particular was great for eating outside. \n\nAs you can probably guess by the name as well as the location... this is a seafood establishment. The menu consists of items such as: shrimp, fish fillet (salmon, tilapia, mahi mahi), fish and chips, scallops and more. They also have non-seafood dishes like burgers and such. So if you're not really into seafood, you'll have options. We sat outside in a wooden deck/patio which was nice. There are these big bells that if you see a dolphin swimming in the water you have to ring it! I thought that was a cute touch. And luckily enough, we saw a few! \n\nFor dinner I got the shrimp scampi (lightly sauced) and it was pretty good. I'm not sure if they cook things different down there but the sauce was heavy for my liking. The shrimp and pasta was cooked well. It was just that scampi sauce. I'll try this place again and update when I got back to good ol' FL.",

  "text": "I hate the guy who wrote the song \"Sweet Home Alabama\".  \n\nCafe Bosna has a big list of \"Chef's Specials\" that are subject to limited availability throughout the day.  Our server, the son of the owner/cook, said that they guy who wrote the penultimate southern rock anthem likes the food so much that he goes in and buys up all the food to last him through the week.  This infuriated me because it's selfish and it's bad business.  They need to come up with a plan with that guy because it could anger customers like me.  \n\nThen there is the decor.  First, the tables are metal with metal chairs like the social hall at the VFW or your local church.  The tables are covered in vinyl white table cloths.  We sat next to some shelves that had a DVD player that wasn't plugged in, excess glasses, books and paperwork that looked like mail that was open and it was left on the shelf.\n\nIn the front was a small stage and there was a guy playing guitar and one playing mandolin who are supposedly there every Thursday through Saturday.  They played easy listening hits from the last century.  They played very well.  The music isn't very loud but there is something strange about hearing an instrumental version of \"Mr. Sandman\".  \n\nThere were a few specials left.  I tried the beef roulaten and it was very good.  It was served with mashed potatoes and red cabbage.  I also had the cabbage soup and it was some of the best soup I've ever had.    My sister had the Wienerschnitzel and my mom had the Jagerschnitzel.  I tried both and both tasted like they came straight from the Fatherland.  Everything was expertly prepared, fresh and flavorful.\n\nPlease note that this restaurant does not serve any alcohol.  The menu says \"BYOB\" so I assume you can bring your own portable potent potable.  I don't know if there is a corking fee or not.\n\nThe food is the only reason that I would return.  I think this place could easily be translated to an upscale eatery.  However, as it is now, it's not the most comfortable place to enjoy a meal.",

  "text": "The Yellow Submarine has been serving up sizeable sandwiches with a side of sass, sense of humor, and sarcasm for almost 40 years in the Reno-Sparks area! The story is a sweet one, and one I love to hear in our community. \n\nThe original owner had grown the business from one successful shop to three in about 20 years. When he decided to retire, he sold two and was approached by an employee who'd been there for almost 20 years who was interested in buying the original business. He told her to make an offer, so she did and, in response, he cut her number in HALF and said the place is yours! Rumor has it he's now off sailing the world, not in a submarine, but a photo of him on his boat sits up on a shelf watching over everything. I was told he still calls to check in and give the new owner a hard time, and I'm sure that's how this place has kept up the witty and gritty sarcastic vibe and spirit all these years. \n\nUnder that tough exterior is a business run on dedication, love, and camaraderie and you feel that as soon as you walk in. I showed up a little after 7 (they close at 8), and there was one other customer there picking up, what I learned was her usual Thursday order. The nice gal behind the counter made me feel right at home, and said she'd be with me ASAP. I went ahead and explored the shop a little more, which was when I noticed the half priced beer on Thursdays ($1.50!). I grabbed one and started looking at the fun trinkets, crafts, signs and photos all over the walls, including a large collection of Wizard of Oz memorabilia, all of which really give you a sense of who runs this place. \n\nWhen it was my turn to order, I was excited, and asked her what's good. She said the Yellow Sub was the way to go. This thing sounded like a monster with ham, salami, and pastrami, provolone and swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sprouts (I didn't get these), mayo, oil & vinegar, and parmesan cheese. I came in hoping for an Italian sub, so I asked to sub capicola for pastrami, which she was happy to do, and she even offered to sprinkle some oregano on for a little more Italian flair! I had seen the 12\" sub go home with the other lady, and it could feed 4, so I opted for the 6\" and it was massive! The bread was fresh and had that chewy texture I look for in a sub roll, the meat plentiful (at least 1/2lb!), and the veggies crisp and delicious with just the right amount of \"dressing\" from the oil & vinegar, parmesan, S&P and oregano.\n\nI'm amazed it took me almost 7 years to find it, but I'm so glad I took Yelper Amanda M's suggestion and went in last night. I will be back soon and I'll be bringing others to meet this institution face to face.",

  "text": "Our group of gals headed over to Tavern for a brunch while visiting Nashville for a bachelorette party. We were a party of five, and while we waited for a table, we found a back bar that was quieter than the main dining room chock-full of brunchers and bach parties ( I literally had no idea that Nashville was such a bach party destination). At this little back bar was one of the most chill bartenders, Rebekah, who took care of us with delicious bloody marys and bellinis (and much needed waters). During brunch, there is a two-for-one on their Brunch Libations which includes bloody marys, mimosas, bellinis, and sangria. Definitely worth it. \n\nWe opted to sit outside since the weather was pleasant. The prices are really fair especially since some of the dishes were massive. I split the Singapore Stir Fry with another gal, and my own dish seemed like one serving. I also got avocados to mash into it!  I do feel like this dish could've had more oomph of flavor, but maybe its toned down for the hoi polloi so ask for some hot sauce!  \n\nThe Maple Fondue is great to try a little bit of everything on their menu, and I love savory and sweet flavors together. Standout was the grilled spicy chicken sausage. Great for the whole table. \n\nNot sure if it was because we were outside, but our waitress (not Rebekah, but a different gal) was a bit MIA at times. Note to folks wanting to eat outside during the summer, at some point it will get warm, haha, so maybe bring a fan 'cause what's brunch without a cute fan. \n\nI'd definitely suggest this as a great spot to bring a group for brunch, and would be interested to check them out on a return visit for other eating hours and to peruse their beer selection! \n\n$11.50 SINGAPORE STIR FRY\n#1 short-grain rice / sunny side up eggs / bacon / scallions / sweet & spicy soy / wok-flavored\n\n$17 MAPLE FONDUE ( FOR THE TABLE)\nwarm maple syrup / fresh fruit / red velvet waffle / grilled sausages / pain perdu",

You bet, Ben's Meat has you covered here, too!\n\nThey offer hot items made to order such as Croquettes (GO TRY ONE NOW), gluten free chicken & fries, and various sandwiches/subs!  Don't forget custom orders for holidays such as their Gluten Free Pumpkin Pies!\n\nBe sure to take a jaunt around the whole store to get a feel for what they offer as well as taking in their generational picture wall back by the coffee and bistro table section (you might even find a shot of Dave with Gordon Ramsey).  Owened and operated by the same family in Edmonton, since 1953 - not something you find everyday!\n\nAnd above all, remember they are closed on Sundays so you best be getting there no later than Saturday for your Sunday BBQ needs!",

  "text": "This is not my favorite Goodwill location but it has some good points.  They have a nice drive-thru donation area and the store itself is very large.  However, about half of the store is dollar store junk.  \n\nIt's like a dollar store was going out of business and donated their entire stock to the store.  And it's not just a small section of the store...there is a literal warehouse at the back of the building and the crap is allllllll over the store.  These are not the type of items that I hope to find at a Goodwill.  I want a velvet painting of Elvis...not a tube of hemorrhoid cream or a plunger.   \n\nThe departments are VERY loosely organized.  For example, all the childrens clothing is in the same area but none of it is separated by size or gender.  All of the shoes are in the same area but not separated by gender or size.  The racks of womens clothing are separated by type and have tags along the racks indicating they are separated by size but they are not.  You are just as likely to find a size 2 in the \"XL\" rack as you are an XL.  I really wish they would put all the plus sizes in a certain area like every other f*cking thrift store...it would make my life so much easier.  \n\nComing from a larger town with many very organized and shoppable thrift stores this place is dissapointing.  You really have to dig and it's a bit of a treasure hunt to sort through all the dollar store items.  \n\nI will say it's pretty clean for a Goodwill.  They keep the items picked up off the floor for the most part and the employees are all very friendly.  But honestly if there was a different Goodwill in town I'd go to that one instead.  Time to check out the Salvation Army!",

However, if I'm in Italy - I'm eating pizza. And, if I'm in Indy, I'm eating Bazbeaux (conveniently located in my neighborhood).  \n\nI think it's the wide variety of available veggies that makes me love Bazbeaux so much. Last night, I opted for the new \"Fresh Pizza\" - pesto/olive oil in place of pizza sauce, arugula, roasted tomatoes, mozzarella (sliced), basil with added garlic and proscuitto. I was a little bummed that I didn't opt for the larger size because by the final slice, my friends and I were passing it like a pipe...just oneeee moooorrreeee bitteeee... The cherry on top?

  "text": "*drum roll please*\n\nI will be the very first to confess that I am not a coffee drinker. I never got used to the taste of coffee, although I do like the smell of freshly-brewed coffee. What I do enjoy is a place to visit with friends, sip a beverage of my choosing, and relax in a comfortable \"homey\" environment.\n\nSips Specialty Coffee House is just such a place, located along Gunn Highway near Citrus Park. You'll find Sips in a little strip mall out in front of Super WalMart and down the block from an Amscot financial center. It's right at the intersection of Gunn and Henderson Road.\n\nWalking in the front door I had to do a double-take because I thought that I'd stepped back into my mother's kitchen. You could smell all of the wonderful scents of baked goods, along with the flavors of coffee and toppings. There were people sitting at tables, sipping their drinks, playing cards, board games, laughing, and chattering away. The decorations were definitely right in line with what my Mom would have placed around her kitchen.\n\nI had the opportunity to meet the owners, Caryn and Ken Reed, and learn a bit about their journey from Michigan to Florida, and the idea for their coffee house which opened six months ago. Very nice, down-to-earth people who are looking to provide that comfy neighborhood gathering place for people to meet up, play a game of Jenga or chess, and do a bit of networking. \n\nOh yes, and enjoy that coffee - hot, iced, blended, frozen - you name it. The house special is Sips Mocha which is made with white chocolate, swirls of caramel, steamed milk & espresso. They have lattes and mochas and cappuccinos and espressos, fruit smoothies, hot teas, iced teas, and your regular ol' cup o' Joe. There's also a refrigerated case with fruit juices, soda, and bottled water.\n\nThey have a baked goods counter with bagels, muffins and pastries, and these AMAZING homemade dark chocolate cupcakes with Reese's cups inside.  YUMMMMM!!!!\n\nFor those who are on the go and don't want to climb out of your car, then Sips has a drive-up, full-service window. You can get a single-serving cup, or pick up one of their containers of coffee for the office.\n\nNow one final treat -- especially for us Yelpers. Sips happens to employ the very lovely and sweet Ms. Cece C. as a barrista, and I highly encourage you to stop in and say Hi to her.\n\nYes, I understand, there are a lot of places where you can stop for coffee, but not many places offer this type of cozy atmosphere. It is worth the time to stop and make some new friends while enjoying a great cup of......well, I was gonna say tea, but y'all would probably like the coffee a whole lot too.",

I got acquainted to the salon via Yelp, and was definitely willing to try it despite the distance from my house based on the reviews and positive comments. \n\nOnce I got there, I parked on a side street (free, 2am-8pm for 2 hours only) which was  no trouble at all and walked a block to the salon. The area is different from what I was expecting, seeing as this was my first time in this part of town, seemed a little...grubby. However, the salon was presentable, and almost had a little bit of a hipster vibe (it IS organic, anyway) which I was comfortable with. They dont have state of the art decor and furniture, but I liked the homey feel and their vintage pieces and the ease at which the clients and hair stylists moved around. I was offered a drink, and sat to get my hair washed, cut and dried, all for $35. Very affordable, especially for me! She listened to all my concerns and then gave me a nice trim and updated my current cut for the look I wanted. Nothing bad to say about the entire experience. I loved the little scalp massage during the wash too!\n\nDefinitely a good experience and I'd likely come back in the future to get my hair cut again, but do wish it was a little closer to home.",

I just needed to change things, and with the help of Matt, Arnold, Josh and sometimes Brad I'm getting there. Initially I started with a 3week trial package and I then signed up for more permanent membership. Since there are always membership drives for the group classes I've signed up for, the classes can vary in size from 5-16 people. Psychosomatic Fitness offers classes as early as 5 am and as late as 6:30pm during the week and two sessions on Saturday morning at 8 and 9am. They are closed Sunday.\nIt's not at all easy but overall if you are willing to do the work, they provide the tools to help you reach your goals. No two sessions are the same, it is always a mix up of various things. \nI started out with a right foot injury and a left knee strain. So when it's time for certain sets, like box jumps, which pretty quickly hurt my knee, I tell them I need an alternative and they find alternatives to make sure I'm working what I need to without hurting myself. As hard as some sessions have been, I haven't injured myself and I've had success in losing weight and getting into better shape.",

The lobby area is large and impeccably clean. The size of the lobby is particularly nice when you're bringing in your healthy dog/puppy/pet, you needn't sit too close to potentially ill animals (and obviously, the reverse as well--as I wouldn't want my sick pup exposing healthy doggies).\n\nDr. Davis was thorough, kind, and patient with my many questions. \n\nBecause, here's the thing--I'm a bit of a researcher. I adopt a puppy and books are borrowed from the library, research is done online, and friends who have dogs are faced with a litany of questions (How long did house training take for your dog? How did you balance the need to socialize your puppy with the need to keep them safe and healthy prior to their full range of immunizations?). And, if you're also a bit of a researcher, you know--you are incessantly faced with conflicting data (never get upset with a puppy when they mess in the house, just patiently bring them outside--or--If you catch them *in* the act, definitely firmly say no--or--??? So much information!).\n\nSo, in short? I need a veterinarian who is going to cut straight through my new-puppy-mom-crazy. Dr. Davis absolutely did this, calmly and without judgement, which I very much appreciated.\n\nSince then, I've had occasion to bring her back (she had a UTI). They were able to get us in quickly, diagnose her, and we left with medication in hand (the entire process took less than a half hour--and that's with a urinalysis).\n\nWonderful!\n\nGet to it!",

This place is very cool and the Philly-rrito burrito is pretty amazing. Dear hip, amazing and talented people from the tattooed pig, I am just trying to help when I say, 'My Philly-rrito burrito was wonderful but I don't think you need all of the french fries stuffed in there.  At least not well done french fries.  The 1st half of my Philly-rrito burrito was overpowered by the taste and smell of well done fries.  For the 2nd half, I took out the french fries and the meat was amazing and the sauces were stupendous complements.  I do love how you decorated the place.  This was a very good overall experience.",

  "text": "This is a nice hike, I\"m not sure exactly where the trail gears off too the only sign of it is at the entrance.  I crossed the tracks and headed to the beach, they have a sign posted it's where the sea lions gather between December and May and they close the beach access off between those months.  You would be able to see the sea lions from the cliff with their pups.  The day I went hiking we just walked along the ocean as the little ones gathered their shells and we walked from one end to the only other way out and hiked back along the bluff from the parking lot (no sign posted)  the trail is surrounded by chrub.  It eventually goes along side a rail road track and we saw the train twice while hiking.  When we came back I saw people walking on the other side of the train track in a field which I thought was private property but I\"m guessing where the trail head actually is.  Either way, both sides of the track is a nice hike.  It was empty when we went exploring the area. Saw some people hang gliding above us.   I loved the quietness and I only saw one jogger when I got to the train area.  The beach access itself is empty just a few joggers and at the parking lot entrance at the far end of the beach is where some people gathered but it's a nice quiet beach area over all.  Total distance we did was 6-7 miles.",

  "text": "For as many times as I've been to Moriarty's, I've never had the wings! Inspired by a trip to Wing Bowl, in which I consumed zero wings myself, Moriarty's seemed like the perfect spot to help that craving.\n\nMy group was seated at a table upstairs. I had never been upstairs before and thought it was only for private functions. It had the same cute Irish pub vibe as downstairs but much more spacious. To our disappointment, the upstairs bar had a very limited draft and bottle list as compared to the fantastic selection downstairs. We made do with Allagash White drafts and obviously ordered the wings! For good measure we decided to split an order of nachos supreme with chili too.\n\nThe wings weren't everything I had imagined but they were pretty darn good. They could have been a little warmer when they came out but they'd probably cool off eventually. The wings were huge. As our waitress described, they had a joint on them. The sauce wasn't super spicy but it a great buffalo flavor. \n\nThe nachos were pretty bland. They almost seemed over cooked. Perhaps too many beans and not enough tomatoes or jalapenos. The cheese was overly melted as well.\n\nOverall, good atmosphere, good wings, good beers, good friends and good times.",

  "text": "Those that know me well are quite aware of my low aptitude for beer. Sure I know my wines, but now, I'm thinking it's time to really understand beer. With the beer boom going on in the old pueblo, I don't tire of seeing more breweries hop on the scene, and Ten Fifty-Five Brewing is doing many things well! This small operation started out in a home kitchen and has wowed locals since it's debut in Tucson. They have four beers in constant rotation and plan to have six by November. And so far, so good! Actually, great! What I find especially great is the variety. They really make beer for many palates to enjoy. I typically steer away from IPAs, so lucky for me, the Lazy Duck (American Wheat) and Leap Pale Ale are light and crisp. The Leap Pale Ale is their flagship brew and in my humble opinion, a perfect beer for those that don't want a super hoppy beer. It's just the right amount! I tasted two other beers in my flight, which are not necessarily going to always be available in their rotation. The XOXO Coffee Stout (made with coffee beans from EXO Roasters) and the Pukka Bitter (British style Ale). I enjoyed both. They also make a double IPA, the Two Sons Citra, which was sold out. As mentioned earlier, this operation is quite small and carefully run by two owners, John Vyborny and Chris Squires. Both are super passionate about their craft and they're pouring some mad love into their nano-brews. Tasting hours are limited, so make sure to visit them Thursday and Friday 4pm-7pm and Saturday 2pm-7pm. They've recently expanded their space and now have more seating, a huge chalkboard menu and a tasting bar. Stop by and have flight! Meet the owners and have a chat. While small, it's cozy and welcoming and all beer drinkers-beginning or expert will be in a hoppy (pun intended) place upon first sip. Prices start at $2 for 6oz pours, growlers are $8. If you can't make it into the brewery for a visit, you can find their beer at several local restaurants including Playground, The Good Oak, La Cocina, Tap & Bottle, Zona 78 Hacienda del Sol, Pasco and Wilko. Cheers!",

Michael T. was coming to join us at about 12:45 so we wanted to get there a little early to get our names in for the bar.  It didn't really help much, they only have like 8-10 seats at the bar.  I haven't heard of a restaurant reducing their size on a move to another location.  But these guys did just that.  Probably a reduction of up to 5 seats.  \n\nSo we walked in just as a group was being sat.  When we finally were seated...we sat in their seats!  Yep the bar is that small.  But that was ok...we didn't have any push for time.  When we sat, Michael T is well known in these parts and the Chef remembered my name too, we were started on a quick regimen of goodness.  And my goodness it was good.  Usually we focus on the raw because that is just what we like...but the new Menu has so much new baked stuff and cooked stuff we had to try as much as we could.  \n\nThe baked section was good, but these rolls might be harder to share for groups that aren't super comfortable.  The rolls are cooked and the stick together and fall apart.  This is NOT a complaint, it's just a warning.  They were all very good.  I especially liked the Pizza roll.  The best thing I had this time was the yooki, yuki, uke, I have no idea how he spelled it.  But it was salmon with some ginger and some sort of sauce on top.  Just wowfreakingawesomeamazing for my mouth.  I could just eat a whole batch of these.\n\nI was able to get a nice bottle of cold unfiltered Sake.  Exactly what I needed and it hit the sport perfectly.\n\nWe walked out full and happy. \n\nSo a few notes...\nDon't go right at peak time and expect them to set you at the bar.\nWe didn't sit at a table so we don't know how well the tables are served.\nIf you can wait til 2ish you can probably get in pretty easily.\nWhen you do go...you will probably see 20 people you know.  We did.\nParking sucks compared to their old place.  This mall probably has the worst parking lot in the city.\nStill easily top 3 sushi places.\n\nSee you there!  Yes, that's me sitting there waiting for the bar.",

Given that New Orleans' first mayor, Étienne Boré, invented the sugar granulation process in 1795, Southern Candymakers was the only appropriate choice.

I highly suggest this restaurant if you're looking for a fresh variety of rolls, sashimi, and hot plates.\n\nI ate here Saturday for dinner, and the restaurant was packed. I'm not sure if they take reservations, so be prepared to wait during peak hours. The way the AYCE works is the server takes your order and brings your food, but you can order anything from the menu, as all foods are included in the price. Saturday dinner was $18, which I felt was more than reasonable, considering that you have appetizers, soups, salads, hibachi, sushi rolls, and sashimi to choose from.\n\nI had the miso soup and hot and sour soup, which are single cup serving sizes. Both were tasty and flavorful.\n\nMy table shared appetizers, like sautéed string beans, fresh wakame (seaweed) salad, krab Rangoon, fried dumplings... All of which I do recommend. They were freshly prepared and very tasty. We also had the fried scallops, which were just okay. They were very doughy, so I suggest saving your appetite for other menu items.\n\nThe sushi rolls were all delicious! They each come with 4-6 pieces. My personal favorite was the Rock N Roll, which had shrimp tempura, cream cheese, and eel. They have like 30 different rolls to choose from, so all palettes will certainly be catered to.\n\nThe only downside is that each order takes quite some time to arrive to your table. If you order too much but spaced too far apart, you might find yourself getting full before the rest of your order arrives. This is bad because they will charge you for any piece of sushi left over. I do suggest the table eating family style and sharing, and you'll have a great dining experience!",

It's casual with plenty of seating and you can order at a kiosk, which is much appreciated.\n\nI did a quick scan of the reviews to know not to order the pho. I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli bowl (bun thit nuong with cha gio), my sister had the Vietnamese hoagie (banh mi thit nuong), and my brother-in-law ordered the broken rice (com tam) with a cha gio side. Everything was excellent. The pork was super flavorful and there were tons of fresh vegetables and herbs in my bun. My sister said the bread on her banh mi was great. And my BIL loved his perfectly cooked and delicious com tam. We all appreciated the crispness of the cha gio. Even my baby niece enjoyed the vegetables we gave her. I love that they have a house-made fish sauce, which add depth to everything.\n\nI'd stop here again if craving Vietnamese in Center City.",

The staff is very kind and accommodating. I had a bad cough and several staff members gave me cough drops when I asked around. Very sweet! \n\nI saw the Great Gatsby and it was an incredible show.

  "text": "New Day has been serving meads and ciders in Fountain Square for about seven years.  So, I thought it about time to stop in and see what I was missing.\n\nThe shotgun style shoppe has a serving room in the front and a gathering place/gallery in the back half.  The serving room is lined with tables on the left.  The right side is made up of a display area for merchandise and a long bar area that has blackboards for upcoming events, beverages, and menu items to enjoy while sipping your drinks.\n\nSince it was my first time here, I went with a flight (6 selections for $8).  They hand you a flyer that you can fill out and indicate your selections.  On the back is a listing of custom cocktails that are available made from the house beverages.\n\nOkay, I will admit that I had no idea what mead was other than something knights and commoners drank while roaring about their conquests.  So I asked.  Basically, it is similar to wine, but made with other fruits instead of grapes.  They can also use honey instead of sugars.  However, like craft beers, the drinks can have a variety of ingredients that can take them into a wide range of flavors.\n\nMy flight had three hard ciders and three meads.  The Gold Rush (6% ABV) is a dry, champagne like drink.  The South Cider (6%) is more of a gateway beverage for someone who is used to commercial apple ciders sans alcohol.  It is sweet with the taste of apples and honey.  I also tried the seasonal Barrel Aged JC (Johnny Chapman) that is deep in flavor due to the black strap molasses (12%).  This is a drink for those who like their drinks to kind of slap them in the face with flavor!  Surprisingly smooth, it is very complex and somewhat herbal in aftertaste.\n\nThe meads I tried had a variety of flavors.  The Washington's Folly (6%) is a cherry mead with fresh tart cherry notes.  The Shelby Blue Ribbon (6%) is made with Strawberry and Rhubarb.  The aroma of rhubarb adds to the enjoyment of this one.  My final selection is another seasonal selection called Breakfast Magpie (8%).  This is a black raspberry mead with a strong coffee (espresso) infusion.  The coffee taste is strong and dominates the raspberry flavors.\n\nAs for the rest of the business, the staff seems friendly and well informed.  The merchandise ranges from t-shirts to glasses and growlers.  There are several selections available year round, but the seasonals come in roughly each quarter, but last only as long as the supply lasts.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my beverages and the experience here.\n\nReview #251",

I was amazed at how much nicer this location is compared to the one closer to my house. It's true when they say in retail, \"Location, Location, Location.\" It does make a difference. \n\nWhat impressed me, was the produce and meat departments. WOW! very impressive. I'm not even Jewish and I was also impressed with the Kosher section. So impressed, that I grabbed a few items that were on sale.\n\nOne section that was sort of a disappointment was their discount section. I guess everything really gets bought up here, because the variety of items was not as impressive as at my regular market and I do love a bargain. \n\nWhen checking out, I had to change lanes. The cashier was so rude and mean to the two people ahead of me, I was afraid of what I would say, if he crossed me. So I politely went to the next lane and waited my turn there. Some folks are not made for customer service, especially old curmudgeons. \n\nWill I return? - I would if I still lived in STL, but I've moved. \n\nWhen: September 17, 2020\nWhy: Power Grocery Shopping with a friend.",

  "text": "Okay, this is an edit after just dining there tonight:\n\nThey have snow crab legs now, along with sauteed dungeness crab and mussels, which is a major plus in my book.  The sauteed crab was pretty good imitation of the ginger and scallion style crab you would get in Chinatown, except with less starch, which is a good thing.  Still missing the crayfish, though.  The sushi is still pretty much the same as before, but the seafood is definitely better.  Thus, I'm upgrading to 3.5 stars.  If you're in the area, it's worth it to stop by, especially since they still have the 20% discount.  I would do so on a weekend night, because that seems to be when they bring out the best dishes. \n\nOriginal:\n \nThis used to be Star East Buffet, but reopened about 2 weeks ago.  What can I say?  It's your typical Chinese buffet, but without snow crab legs, at least on the night that I went.  They do offer steamed sea bass, which was quite deliciously flavored with ginger, scallion, soy, and sesame oil.   The sushi wasn't too good, and they had a very limited offering of nigiri, sadly.  I was able to request a spicy tuna roll, though.  The salmon wasn't the freshest, either.  There is a small hibachi station next to the sushi arena, and you can get a custom-made stir fry, but honestly, if you want a REAL stir-fry go to International Buffet in Bustleton, not here.  The salad buffet was very clean, and they do offer a generous variety of cold salads, including pasta and chicken based ones.  Probably my favorite item was shrimp dumplings, although only a few are brought out every 15-20 min.  In terms of the hot entrees, they are your typical take-out dishes, and none truly stood out in either direction.  The crystal dumplings filled with mung bean custard were amazing - you have to try them!  I'll probably head back and get a box of those to go.  \n\nOverall, not somewhere I would go to, save in forced situations.   The prices are a bit cheaper than King Buffet, but it is not its competition, by any stretch.  They were offering a 20% discount, and have ads in Clipper.  The owners have another buffet (Jim's in North Wales), which does offer snow crab legs at the same price.  If you're in the area, head to King's, where you can happily eat your weight (or double) in crab legs, nigiri, and oysters.\n\nLunch: 6.99\n             3.99/lb\nDinner: 10.99 M-Th\n              11.99 F-Sun\n               4.99/lb\n               7.99/lb sushi and seafood",

We sat upstairs on the balcony over looking the street. The wait staff all seemed to have to run up and down rickety stairs to deliver food and drinks which may have contributed to the lackluster service. \nWe only saw our actual waiter initially taking our order then when the bill came. A couple of other folks were also taking orders and delivering food and drinks around us. \nWe ordered a Yuengling and appetizer of fried gator along with ice tea. The gator was as tough as a marine drill Sargent with hemorrhoids.\nBut because it came decades after we ordered it, one of the waitresses (maybe manager?) comped the gator. So we never bothered to tell her it was like eating fried dinosaur ass. \n\nSo why 4 stars? Because this place is set up to be one hella great venue for Mardi Gras. And you can tell by the set up that theirs bars and service facilities to take care of upstairs patrons. \n\nBring plenty of beads or a easy access shirt or blouse to flash your junk to collect some.

It was built in 1926, saved from demolition in 1977, and has gone on to be one of the most successful theaters of this type in the country (according to their webpage). Before every show, an organist plays tunes on a Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Organ to entertain the audience, and then it is lowered below the stage.  The organ is a remnant from the days of silent movies when it provided the musical accompaniment.\n\nThe theater shows mostly Independent Films, but in the summer they have a Summer Classic Movie Series - this year some of the movies offered were All The President's Men, Casablanca, A Raisin In the Sun, and The Wizard of Oz.  They also hold some concerts here, as well as lecturers.  One of their big selling points is to have someone speak after a movie that was either involved with the movie, or an expert on the movie, who provides extra insight into the movie, which is always fun to hear.\n\nThere is a small concession stand at the front which serves standard movie fare - but also wine and cocktails. The main bathroom is also pretty cool, so make sure you visit.  The theater's seats are small and squeaky, and for whatever reason, every movie I see here has people chatting during the movie, but except for those two negatives, this theater is a great spot to have a memorable night.",

  "text": "My cousin was in town this week and she was dying for a pedicure while she was visiting. We had a hair appointment booked at a salon on Whyte for later in the afternoon, so we went to the nearby Kool Nails. What a terrible name for a nail salon, I thought. But we tried it anyway.\n\nThe booked us in for about an hour later, so we grabbed some lunch and went back for 1:45 PM. They were just finishing up with another client and there were only two staff members, so Emily began her pedicure first and they started on mine about 5 or 10 minutes later.\n\nIt was nice to see them clean the foot soaker thing (I have no pedicure terminology knowledge) before I got in, and they polish was neatly applied. They didn't have an amazing selection of colours, but I did find a purple one I liked. For $30, it was just alright.\n\nBut I leave you with one question, yelpers: why did they have to pumice the entire bottom of my feet? I don't have dry skin on the middle of my foot - just ticklish nerves. Yikes!",

  "text": "What's my favorite food?  BARBECUE!  What's my favorite sound to listen to while eating my favorite food?  VROOM VROOOOOOM!\n\nThat's right, ladies and gents, this backwoods gem is straight out of Easy Rider... you half expect to turn and see Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda eating at the table next to you.  Not Jack Nicholson, unfortunately... although he's all of our favorite character, George Hanson was beaten to death in his sleeping bag.  Ah, and so went the leftist movement.\n\nAnyways, back to the review.  You drive up the highway past Santa Barbara, and wind up a beautiful hill and into the wine country.  Turn off on an easy to miss left turn, and then go right down into a heavily-wooded canyon.  \n\nCold Spring Tavern originated as a coach stop in the mid-1800s, and the buildings all (at least) appear to be original.  Water damaged wood structures with the clear evidence of termite infestation.  Now it's a hot spot for motorcycle riders (both the original gangsta freebird riders and also the rich dudes with a bike or the crotch rockets), old guys with really sweet cars, and also the everyday Joe who just wants some damn good barbecue.\n\nIf you go on a day that isn't Sunday, you will have the option of a variety of reasonably-priced sandwiches, ribs, chicken, and pork.  Sunday afternoon is really the time to go, however.  A MASSIVE Samoan guy manning a barbecue, and piling huge sandwiches full of beautifully cooked tri-tip.  The barbecue sauce has a little kick and is delicious.  Even the horseradish (of which I am not usually a fan) is a perfect compliment to this sandwich.  Get two of them, trust me, and for $6 or so a pop this is a deal that can't be beat.  Sloppy, tender meat, perfectly complimentary sauces, and fresh rolls that are other-worldly.\n\nAnd then sit around, gorge yourself, have a few drinks and enjoy the live music.\n\nThis is a place where you go to be yourself... no one is judging you, because everyone is there for one reason and one reason only... great food and a unique atmosphere.\n\nIf you're going for dinner, make sure to bring a full wallet, because the prices escalate quickly.  Gone are the rib and tri-tip deals.  Arriving are the interesting dishes (rabbit, duck, venison, etc.) with prices to match.  I haven't eaten dinner, but I have looked at the menu, and it looks like a very special spot... I will be going, and I will add to this review when I do.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place.  It is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  I have driven up the coast from LA (about a 1 1/2 hour trip) just for lunch.  5 stars without any hesitation.",

This is truly one of the finest hotels anywhere in the country.  The guest rooms are all unique, luxuriously appointed, and amazing.  The Sazarac bar is my favorite in the city.  Dominica is fantastic.  The pool area is best in class.  The gift shop is top-notch.  Even the on-site business center is extremely well run and super friendly.  \n\nAbsolutely everything about this hotel will leave you wishing you could live here, but where the Roosevelt really shines is in their world class service!  Everyone you encounter, from the bellmen, to house-keeping, to front desk to concierge, will make you feel like family.  \n\nThe Roosevelt is my top recommendation for friends or business associates visiting New Orleans, and I've never heard anything but rave reviews from everyone I've sent there, without exception.",

They are typically known for having a great selection of seafood and their shrimp and crab are delicious. They were a little skimp on the prime rib offering for NYE but regardless it was tasty.\n\nThey had champagne for NYE dinner and I've honestly never, even in Vegas, tasted such delicious champagne! For $24.99 this place kicks ass for me even though I have been to many of the Las Vegas buffets which cost more.\n\nThe staff is very helpful and seating is quick, they are friendly and my drink was always refilled.

Their oysters are so fresh and they have the best texture. If someone has never eaten oysters before, I recommend trying them here so you'll be sure to have a good experience. Their raw oysters are amazing and their charbroiled oyster are even better! TRY THEIR OYSTERS!!!\n\nSome of their other dishes are just as amazing. They Lobster Marco is to die for! It's a whole lobster stuffed with angel hair pasta with shrimp for only $27. The gumbo is really good with lots of flavor. The spinach salad is good but doesn't really stand out to all their other amazing dishes. Their Spicy Andouille Ravioli was beyond good, I highly recommend this as an entree.\n\nAside from the food, the parking lot sucks when this place is crowded. The restaurant can smell really fishy sometimes, but that just proves how fresh their seafood is. The service here is absolutely exceptional. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves seafood!",

It was a surprisingly excellent burger. Very juicy and full of flavor. Service on this particular visit was extremely slow, and with all the televisions showing college football plus the music blaring, the place was pretty loud.\n\nMy second visit I met a friend for happy hour.  Much lower volume level this visit, and the server was much more efficient.  Great deals for happy hour - I went with the lemon drop martini, on special for $6.  All the appetizers are discounted for happy hour also, so my friend and I ordered a smorgasbord of items.  \n\nDuck wings are mentioned in every review, and they were great - nice and crispy, with a bit of a bite from the sauce. I also loved the drunken meatballs - they too were in a spicy sauce, and cooked perfectly. The big surprise of the night was the Kobe Brick Pizza - thin crust, loaded with wagyu beef, cheese, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, bacon and arugula, it had a fabulous flavor - I would definitely order this again. \n\nThe only appetizer I didn't love was their version of the Seven Layer Dip: white bean purée, harissa, yogurt, oven roasted tomatoes, smashed avocados, smoked cheddar & chopped olives served with grilled naan.  Even with all those ingredients, it just did not have much flavor.  It was still good, but not great.\n\nI will definitely be back to explore their drink and food menus further, and to take advantage of their excellent happy hour.",

I ordered and the guy at the register asked me if I wanted brown sugar with that.  I've ordered oatmeal dozens of times at different McDonald's and never been asked that so I thought maybe he meant... if I wanted something different than the usual oatmeal.  I politely declined.  \n\nWell, brown sugar is definitely something that's normally in the oatmeal.  I found that out when I tried mine and it was plainer than plain.  Okay, so he asked and I declined. I'll take the blame for that, but the oatmeal also wasn't mixed properly and had several pockets of uncooked dry oatmeal.  Bad.  \n\nI had purchased 2 soft drinks and filled them myself at the soda machine.  I got a Diet Coke for me, and a Coke for my friend.  She took one sip and said, \"This is Dr. Pepper.\"  I know I filled it correctly... she mentioned that this is not the first time she has had this happen at this location.  Thankfully Dr. Pepper is among her favorite sodas so she was fine with it.  My Diet Coke tasted a bit watery/thin.\n\nBut seriously... \n\nThe women's restroom was fine.

Eighteen and 1/2 hours later, we finally had our power restored. \n\nFrom 4AM to 10:30PM I watched as Peco trucks traveled down the road, along with firetrucks and police cars. The road was totally blocked, for most of the day. \n\nThis is what ultimately irked me... Asplundh arrived shortly after 4AM, with trucks for removing this huge tree and two flatbed trucks with new poles. \n\nThe Channel 6 news crews were there and the police stayed on the scene to direct traffic turn around. Peco workers were spotted having breakfast at the local eateries and or just sitting in their trucks in the nearby shopping centers. \n\nFrom what I have witnessed, this is atypical of Peco, Verizon and Comcast, to sit in their trucks and eat hero's and drink coffee. When will you be my hero guys? \n\nThe Channel 6 news trucks came, Peco flew down the road to the scene. Later when the helicopters starting pouring in around 5PM and 6PM, the Peco workers again flew down the road to the power outage site. \n\nNow, I know I do not have all the reasons as to why they were not at the scene to restore power, but I do know, as sure as I am typing this Asplundh did their job, early on and left and the news was right on top of this story. \n\nPeco is the major electric and gas power providers in the Philadelphia and surrounding areas. Their generation and transmission charges have gone through the roof. We pay, we can't bitch, because they are the major game in town. \n\nI was off from work and did paperwork by candle light, okay this is cool and I know how they felt in Colonial times, all I needed was a quill pen and ink. I could not cook, do laundry or vacuum. It was a dismal day with the rain pouring down, my sump pump, dehumidifier and laundry pump not being able to assist me, so my basement flooded. \n\nI am hoping the food in both of my refrigerators and freezers is good. \n\nBut, eighteen and one half hours, with no power, TV, computer and Yelp in this day and age, because a tree fell, is inexcusable.",

  "text": "Looking to find a intimate spot for a special dinner, I found Bistro Romano compliments of Open Table.  When we walked in and were quickly seated downstairs, I realized Open Table knew what it was talking about.  The lighting really set the mood, while the seating arrangement ensured privacy.  One minor point is that the lighting is all electric instead of candle lit, however, it didn't take anything away from environment.\n\nWe started with a pair of apps: the Suppli al Telefono and Artichoke Hearts Capri.  The Suppli was lightly breaded and cooked to a crispy perfection while the Hearts were covered with a nice creamy cheese.  Portions on the Hearts were good, but the Suppli seemed a bit small.  Regardless, they were both delicious.\n\nNext up, our mains.  The evening special was a perch with grape tomatoes and capers.  I've never had perch so had been a little concerned, but it turned out to be my favorite of the night.  JJ had the lobster ravoli (8 pcs), which was covered in another smooth cream sauce.  The portions on both entrees were more than fair and we ended up boxing up a bit of both for later enjoyment.\n\nFinally, you can't come to an Italian place with trying the tiramisu.  Again, the portion was very fair and the favors top quality.  It tasted extremely light, making it a perfect way to end the evening.\n\nThe only other thing worth mentioning is they do some type of parking validation.  Wish I knew ahead of time, as I ended up parking on the street blocks away.  No biggie, now I know for next time, and based on my experience, there will be a next time!",

  "text": "Blue Duck is a surprising find hidden in the vastness of Northeast Philadelphia.  It's def worth seeking out.  First of all the atmosphere is bright and cheerful with varied seating that ranges from a counter by the open kitchen to a large communal table near the entrance.  For my first visit I went with the blue duck sandwich.  (Who makes duck sandwiches besides this restaurant?)  It was great.  The shredded duck provides both a sweet and savory taste sensation. I could have used a bit more Swiss chard and a little extra of the blueberry bbq sauce but it was still totally tasty. The menu has much of interest to try on future visits now that I know how to get there.  Blue Duck is a worthy addition to the Philadelphia culinary scene!",

The venue is old school and they kept it that way...staying true to its name. Seating is first come, first served, but there's not much seating at all. Being four-feet-eleven-inches, I couldn't see anything from the back. I had to squeeze in and sit at the side door. It turned out to be a pretty awesome seat. That old jazz vibe was the intention and that's what I got out of it. I enjoyed myself, but there were moments that were a bit slow for me. I understand they're hustling on that platform, but the silence when no one jumps up to tip, eh, you've lost me. Since I paid admission, I expect to be entertained the whole time.",

Excellent soup, rich with big shrimp. The entrees were a 1 1/4 pound lobster and grilled black drum with what was supposed to be a crabmeat topping that wasn't anything that I expected. The lobster was extremely small to say it was 1 1/4 pound but very tasty, me meal (black drum) was grilled scales down which is normally excellent but the fish thin that scales were almost as thick as the meat of the fish. The sauce was excellent but strangely enough put on the side and not on top of the fish and the so called crabmeat was a bready crabmeat stuffing that had mostly bread and little crabmeat. Interesting that I didnt see many people order char broiled oysters which is supposed to be their biggest seller.",

  "text": "Another quality location for this chain in the Tampa Bay Area that I first discovered in San Antonio, Texas almost two decades ago.\n\nThe vast selection of items speaks for itself and the spuds put them ahead of most other \"sandwich and more\" fast casual dining concepts.\n\nOver time, the spuds have become almost a must have on every visit because they are very filling and a great choice on the Choose 2 menu.\n\nTheir selection of soups also stands out to me over similar spots and I haven't found one yet that wasn't worth putting next to my spud of choice for that particular day.\n\nI will say that if you're in the mood for a sandwich, order it as a full size and not as a half or part of the Choose 2. Besides, you get a side item with the full size sandwich and the half is just not large enough on its own even with soup or salad in my opinion.\n\nAnother reason I like McAlister's is how the employees seem very relaxed and competent when taking orders, while also very open to questions and special requests. I've always liked the overall attitude and they don't sweat small details and seem to want to make people happy with their orders. \n\nMaybe it's just me, but I seem to rarely get the forced \"Suggestive Sales Tactics\" from cashiers at McAlister's. And if they do ask if I want a drink, it is like they're just making sure rather than really trying to sell it to run up my bill.\n\nOh, and about half of you hate pickles, so you can be gone now. For the rest of us, don't you love how McAlister's has a huge bucket of pickles cut into quarters that customers can just take as they wish? I find this at a number of various places in Texas (Such as Twisted Root), which brings me back to where I first went to a McAlister's in 1998. It was really good on that San Antonio trip and still is now as they've expanded into Florida.",

  "text": "As a rule, I loathe chain eateries and especially those with order counters.  As exception, I love MOD which is a chain with that ordering set up.  As a rule, I dislike flash fired pizza joints that offer 'all the toppings you want' formats.  (I'm talkin' to you Blaze.)  As exception I love MOD which has this very format.\n\nI'm a MOD fan based on multiple good experiences with MOD outlet in Oregon and my first at this newly opened (roughly mid November) location near Boise Towne Square Mall reinforced why that is so.\n\nThat this MOD was \"lightly customered\" on a weekday at the height of lunch time suggests many mall and Nordstrom Rack shoppers may be unaware this is now open since both are nearby.  But it is.  So here you are.  Now you can go.\n\nTHE DRILL:  Menu for pizzas (salads too) is posted on the wall if you want to choose one of their recommended creations.  Or you can choose to create your own with any toppings in any amount as you talk to the nice people behind the service counter and they move you on down the line from crust type to sauce type to cheeses to toppers.  Pay at the end. Stand aside or take a seat.  They'll call your name at the pick up counter when your eats are ready. (You can also order online and pick up at this same counter.) Bus your own. \n\nEATS & PRICES:  Pizzas in small (feeds 1), MOD (11\" and for us easily feeds two) and a larger one.  Crust in standard thin, thick and I think they have a vegan or GF one too.  Price for MOD size with any toppings = only $7.97.  Top that for good deal!  On the topping topic, all of MOD's (unlike some competitors) are top shelf quality.  For what it is - this is a convenience food chain after all and not a hand thrown Neapolitan pizzeria - the crust is pretty darned good too.  \n\nDOES GOOD SERVICE MAKE FOOD TASTE BETTER?:  It seems the people who work at any MOD are friendly and efficient in moving through people in line, even those who are MOD newbies and need a little extra help for the first visit.  True here too. MOD was started by a former Starbuck's Exec and leverages what works well at that chain too for friendly people serving customers.  They're still working out new place wobbles here but headed in the right direction.\n\nLIBATIONS: Help yourself fountain drinks like real lemonade (Marionberry is a fav), iced tea (one with pear too), sodas in bottles, floats, draft beer and new learning for us today - MOD has milkshakes.  Not that I'd choose one with pizza, but maybe one day I'll order a salad with MOD-est calorie content and pair a shake with it.  No coffee service it seems.\n\nOTHER EXTRAS:  Another reason to love MOD is their No Name cakes.  These are, as you might guess for the way they are wrapped in silver foil, MOD's riff on the Hostess Ding Dong.  But in the case of the MOD, No Name it is a tender really good chocolate cake with luscious vanilla kissed cream filling and enrobed in chocolate ganache.  I know...I thought cake as dessert chaser to a pizza was an odd idea too.  But carried out to eat later with a steaming hot cup of coffee it is \"splendelicious\".  \n\nSPACE WITH LOTS OF SEATING & NOT TOO MUCH NOISE:  As a rule, I'm not such a fan of eating in MOD's spaces just for the noise level created by hard surfaces, high industrial ceilings and really loud, head banging music mixes.  But at this location the music was not turned up too much over the top and I got to listen to the likes of Eric Clapton and CSNY so what's not to love?  Lots of seating in 3 separate indoor areas and looks like outside set up for nice weather.  And a BIG woohoo that among the options of booths for 2 or 4 people, lots of tables with chairs or benches and maybe seating for 80 in total, only 8 of those seats were high chairs at high tables.  Very nice. They get it that standard height seating works for everyone.\n\nPARKING: Private lot but it was packed as there are several convenience food eateries in the complex.  Like a Zupa's next door.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Accessible (aka ADA) spaces in lot, level in the door and throughout the eatery, the cattle chute order line could be difficult for a wheelchair user but payment counter is at standard height, standard height seating tables.  Loos are accessible but the door opening weight far exceeds ADA and Idaho code maximums of 5lbf and so near impossible for mobility disabled person to open. Easy for management to adjust  - it should have been called out as violation by city of Boise building inspectors.\n\nPS:  There is another MOD that opened a month or so ago on Capitol Boulevard near Trader Joes.  I do not know if the two are franchised by the same entity or corporate owned.  MOD allows both as part of their business MOD-el. This small chain launched @ 2008 by a former Starbuck's exec ensures controlled expansion is quality centric by having stores either corporate owned or franchised to a select set of applicants with XX years of documented success in food service enterprises and $XXX,000 in cash on hand.",

The food was just OK. It meant a lot to me that it was fresh and cooked to order.\nThe clam chowder did not have a lot of flavor whatsoever. I had to add the crackers,salt, tobasco and luckily I carry my own little stash of cayenne pepper. I have had clam chowder all over the world and sadly, I cannot recommend this once. It needed some creaminess butt hat could be personal opinion. Get a cup if you are unsure like we did, a bowl of it is a big commitment. There were a lot of people working and things came out very quickly. \nHubby had a local beer which he enjoyed and I had a glass of wine. A glass of wine here means a GLASS, loved it. No frills here, wine right to the top of a glass you would get at your granny's house.\nWe split the fried platter with calamari, shrimp and scallops for $13. Not a ton of food  (3 pieces of each maybe) but the coleslaw complete with raisins and pineapple was a treat and they also throw on about 3 large onion rings. This was a nice dish to split so we did not ingest TOO much fried food. There is also the option to have fried oysters on it which we skipped. I imagine the more you order on the plate, the less you get of each.\nI would for sure come back here. Unpretentious and even a little gritty. Come as you are.\nIf you want fine dining, there are other options on the pier.\nThey will validate your parking if you park on the wharf.",

The price was good, and food was plentiful and hot. \n\nWhen we arrived there was one table of a mother and daughter, and our table.  After we arrived another couple arrived. There was 1 waitress.  While I can't say it ever got truly busy, I can say that she never checked back with us after the initial \"How's everything?\" never asked us if we wanted more water. After we were clearly finished with our food, she never came back to see if we needed boxes. \n\nAt this point 2 more groups came in, one group of 4 and one group of 5 and they sat at the back of the place, those seemed to take up her time. This was about 6:30. My friend and I were done by now, we were looking at our watches, commenting that it was relatively early. By 7pm, though we were still talking, the waitress still hadn't checked on us, when we would try to get her attention, she never did seem to make eye contact with us, she simply ghosted to the back areas of the eatery. \n\nAt 7:15 we had to verbally signal her to get us boxes, and to ask for the check. She then didn't remember them for another spate of time, we finally got out of the establishment at 7:44.  The times are known because I made note.   I would come back for the food, but the service was pitifully slow. Need more help in there.",

I've never witnessed an employee who wasn't empathetic if not sympathetic to the needs of every child they treat, both in the exam room and behind the scenes.  This same courtesy is extended within their own ranks.\n\nTheir dedication to quality extends down to the cut-throat process for choosing the best interns and med students and are truly dedicated to giving them the best education as possible.  They truly have one of the most competitive programs in the country.  I don't know about you, but that's the kind of program to which I want to entrust my child's health.\n\nAnd you'd think cleanliness goes without saying in a hospital, but not so.  Fortunately every area of CHOP is kept impeccably clean and as sterile as possible.  \n\nEvery staff member on every level works their best to make sure the parents feel understood and confident while the children feel secure.

  "text": "Named for its owner, this isn't a bad place to eat (decent-to-good food), and is a fun place to drink (full bar, cool bartenders).\n\nI've been here for a few happy hours and in the late evening to grab a bite. During dinner, our party will take advantage of their bar, ordering beers, wine, and of course, shots. Their appetizers are average (though some folks judge a place just by their appetizers, I'll turn a blind eye), and the entrees are good. It's a large space for any kind of gathering and the restaurant is smack-dab in Chinatown, which means street parking, garages, or lots if you have a car. Prices are slightly higher than what I expect to pay for in Chinatown, but I guess I'm paying for the cool decor and service (always fine for me).\n\nFor those living in/near the suburbs or who want to venture there, check out Fuzion near Skippack, PA - it's owned by the same guy and the food is outstanding.",

  "text": "I heart hoagies!  I meant to review Cucina Italiana the last time that I passed through 30th Street Station, but it slipped my mind... cuz, well, it's not really -that- memorable.\n\nRegardless, it's as good eats as it gets in 30th Street Station, as far as I'm concerned.  When your other options are Mickey D's and Cosi (which I abhor), having the yummy and filling option of Cucina Italiana is a wonderful thing.\n\nFor roughly $7, you can score a \"regular\" sandwich on fluffy bread with a huge amount of meat.  Y'know how Subway uses one of those paper-wrapped prepackaged cuts of deli meat?  My traditional Italian sandwich at the Cucina came with -two- of those.  And they're not messing around.  Then topped off with fresh, crispy lettuce, tomatoes, and thin translucent rings of onions, sweet peppers, and a generous squirt of oil and vinegar, the resulting monstrosity is easily enough to be filling for two people (or in my case, two meals for one and a half people).\n\nCan you think of any better train food?  I'm gonna go with... no.",

This is basically an exclusive club type place that is located right above the House of Blues.  It's dimly lit, sofas are everywhere, they are cozy corners with tables that you can sneak off to and it's decorated like only a super secret hideout can be, with cloth on the walls and interesting art everywhere.\n\nI totally \"get\" why membership to this place is so expensive ($1,000/year for just the \"Bronze\" package).  This is one of those places where the New Orleans elite come to relax without fear of being bothered or harrassed.  Also, there is naturally no photography allowed inside.\n\nI didn't get to experience any of the food...maybe one day.

While my voice was hoarse and my face likely as pale as a sheet of ice, my server was SO sweet.

There's lots of natural light coming in the big windows that surround the room and overlooks the golf course. The sunset was stellar and the backdrop is ideal for photos. Additionally, the food catered was quite delicious for a buffet setting (the chicken was still tender and juicy!). I really liked the mac and cheese too (smart menu picks!).\n\nOne thing that did surprise me was that the seat covers were all wrinkled. I would think a venue like this would take better care to notice those details. (I pay closer attention to those things than most because I plan events, but still). I'd like freshly steamed seat covers if I were paying for a venue as nice as this for my special day. Keep that in mind when planning your event!",

It's happened before, with the strip mall a bit south that houses Hot Wok and Dave's World Famous Bar and Restaurant, among other businesses.\n\nThis highway move thing just works a bugger on the businesses in the area. And especially for Spiro's, because they're now relatively on a dead-end road. It's not really dead-end, but quite local.\n\nBut just a tad south of Olive at what is now called Woods Mill Road and used to be 141. By the Dierberg's Four Seasons.\n\nThe International Supper Club selected Spiro's for its monthly repast. What a fun group.\n\nThe food was terrific. Service was spectacular. The company was tremendous.\n\nAnd Harry came by numerous times as the host-with-the-most to see how we were faring.\n\nI got the lovely house salad (Athenian Salad - $4.75 -- Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, Feta cheese) and Veal Piccata - $18.99 -- Veal cutlet sauteed in garlic, white wine and lemon sauce, served with pasta and white cream sauce.\n\nThe veal was perfectly cooked, quite tender and very tasty. The pasta was a perfect accompaniment.\n\nHarry came by at the end of our meal to offer ouzo shots and baklava! What great desserts!\n\nThanks to Sarah S. and Mallory W. for organizing this fabulous dinner.\n\nAnd thanks to Sarah S. for the artistic chocolates from RJ Chocolatier!\n\nI had a hefty recyclable to-go vessel of more than half of my entrée.",

Someone took my drink order of coffee within a couple of minutes. When they brought my coffee I made my order of the DeLuxe Scramble with sausage, onion and extra cheese as the third ingredient for $8.00 , I also ordered the Black-eyed Peas and Collard Greens for $6.00. It took quite a while to get my food. But I was not surprised because it was very busy! While I was waiting there seemed to be a couple of mix-ups with who was to be seated next, also not too surprising because of how busy they were. I totally enjoyed my scramble and would order it again. I had enough left over for another meal! Well worth the $8.00! I ate the Black-Eyed Peas and Collared Greens for my dinner. They were both perfectly cooked and very tasty. The black-eyes peas were tender and a little bit spicy and the collards were very tender and not at all bitter. I hope that I will be able to have them again sometime this year! For as busy as they were I think that they did a great job! I will be coming back and I would recommend  others to try them!

It was a better deal than parking lot B, not really that much better.  It averaged almost $8 a day while Lot B is $9/ day.  Both are not covered parking but secure.  The difference though is that Flight Park valet's the car.  You don't have to look around for your car like in Lot B and they carry the bags for you.

I'm sure the food is fresh, light, and delicious to some people but I have to totally disagree with anyone that calls it \"healthy\" as it certainly isn't.  They do offer lots and lots of nice looking desserts but everything on the menu, other than the soups, seems very heavy on the carbs, fats, and sugars here so I think some girls delude themselves that they are eating \"healthy\" here just to justify being able to order the super desserts as a \"reward\" for their \"healthy\" eating (if I ate this kind of food ratio often I would be huge!).  The menu is also a bit on the expensive side for the small portion sizes.  \n\nThey really didn't have anything I liked (I love meat but don't eat pig) but the soups were decent but not good enough for the price.  This is definitely a place for a \"light\" lunch.  Il Posto really just reminds me of a coffee shop that decided to throw in some sandwiches (but use some quality ingredients to make them a bit fancier).  The seating area is TINY and has very little space.  \n\nI just find this is a place for dainty girls to eat and not men so I will never be back as it just isn't my type of food.  If you like this type of food and like light lunches this is certainly a place you might want to check out.  If I'm in this area I will be going to Pascal's Manale or Charlie's Steakhouse instead for my healthy food :)",

I attended a Christmas party at the Sutton Place last night; we were in the Vintage Room.\n\nDefinite pros: the room was quite nice, the acoustics were good, I liked the lighting, and....y'know, I just can't think of a fourth.\n\nHere's the list of cons: the food wasn't great, the plates were smaller portions than I expected, the bathrooms were down a hallway and you had to use a keycard to get in, the food came out very slowly, I didn't like the wine, and the coat room was very difficult to maneuver into. I hope it doesn't come across as though I'm complaining, but there were quite a few disappointments to the night.\n\nOf course the night was enjoyable (as Christmas parties always are!) but I hope the organization moves to a different venue next year.",

  "text": "This review comes from someone that despises oysters. First night in NOLA and we are told by a staff member at our hotel that Drago's has some of the best oysters we will ever eat. I'm a bit skeptical but as soon as I hear that they are grilled and are cooked with garlic and parmesan, I am sold. We walk over from our hotel and are seated almost immediately. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and attentive and quickly took our drink order and put in our app request. \n\nWe started off with their crabmeat au gratin, which came served with Zapp's potato chips and then split a dozen of their charbroiled oysters. This meal was a great foreshadowing of the food to come in New Orleans. Not only were these the best oysters I've ever had, but they are the only oysters I've ever liked and one of the best meals I had on my unconventional road trip from New Jersey to Colorado. \n\nDrago's wasn't incredibly busy on the night we visited, but it seems like the kinda place that can definitely fill up quick on a busy night. As others have mentioned, the only thing you should be getting from here are their oysters. The crab meat was certainly tasty but didn't match the $16 price tag. Also be prepared to spend some dough here as a dozen oysters will run you $20. Still not bad for some of the best you will ever have.",

  "text": "I lost my beignet virginity to Café Beignet. And they set the bar high. \n\nBefore my trip to NOLA, I heard that Café Beignet was better than Café du Monde. Luckily on my first morning in town, I walked past this location and got to discover this myself. Also luckily, there was no line at the time of my visit; we were able to walk right up and order. \n\nDespite the lack of crowd, it still took a little while to receive our beignets. I'm mentioning this as a positive! Boy did they taste fresh. There was a light crisp to the outside and they were filled with heaven on the inside. I can see why they are referred to as heaven's pillows. \n\nThe small coffee was still a fairly decent size and it was strong. If you like strong coffee, this coffee is good. \n\nIt had been raining a little earlier so my friend and I ate at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and chatted with us most of the time. \n\nThis café was set back in an adorable courtyard. There was even a live musician. \n\nI did go to Café du Monde later in my trip, however I know that Café Beignet will be my beignet headquarters for all future trips to New Orleans.",

  "text": "Everything is indescribably delicious! But I'll try! The vast space is decorated Japanese-style with dim lighting and friendly, prompt service. Pretty little Japanese dolls are perched beautifully at the foyer entrance, along with the Lucky Cat, who is waving \"hi\" to you ;). Seating inside is a large sushi bar, pub tables, hibachi and regular tables, as well as a few booths running along the outskirts of the restaurant. Cozy.\n\nI'm in this restaurant a lot! You could say I can't live without this one, and this sushi is always in my regular rotation. The rolls here are always made with very fresh fish/seafood and all the accompanying ingredients of fruits and vegetables are super-fresh as well. \n\nI've tried quite a few rolls, and so far, my favorite on the menu under 'Chef's Special Roll', is a fancy roll at $15, called \"The Lobster Dynamite Roll\" - with each piece having a nice big chunk of lobster, it is wrapped in seaweed with a piece of mango, avocado, sushi rice, then covered with spicy tuna, and drizzled with sweet chili sauce to top it all off. Delicious! Akira's rolls are comprised of 8 pieces, and range in price from $4.95 to $18.00 for special rolls.\n\nLunch Specials are always a good way to go. Hibachi Meals come with Onion Soup, Hibachi Vegetables, and Fried Rice. Starting at $9.95 with either Chicken or Vegetable, a lunch with Filet Mignon as your protein is $13.95, and a 'Combination' of two items (Scallops, Salmon, Shrimp, NY Strip), can range in price up to $15.95. Bento Box Specials can be had for about $10, and will include Miso Soup or Salad with Ginger Dressing, White Rice (Fried Rice is $1.50 extra), and a choice of California Roll or Spicy Crab Roll. Two really good lunch deals! Akira also will will pack it to-go for you on some of the lunch specials (obviously not the Hibachi).\n\nThe cooked Dinner/Ala Carte/Appetizer items are very good also. I've tried the Crab Rangoon, filled with sweetened cream cheese. The Katsu Chicken is always excellent; with crunchy and lean white-meat chicken, it is always fried in fresh oil. Chicken Teriyaki and a number of similar proteins are offered ala carte. Sashimi, Yakitori, and even Fried Oysters are just some of the appetizers to get you started on a great meal journey.\n\nIf there is any complaint, it's a very minor one. That is, for to-go rolls, Akira should package the rolls with high-domed lids. This is because with some of the larger rolls, it sometimes becomes necessary to have to scrape part of the toppings off the lid. I was going to dock a star for the price point being a little bit high. However, I'm not going to, because the fresh ingredients, the friendly staff, and the clean and spotless space of this restaurant make their food well worth the money. \n\nI highly recommend Akira Hibachi and Sushi Bar! \n\nDon't be late!\n\nFIVE FABULOUS STARS!!!!!",

  "text": "Besito Mexican Restaurant is located in Westshore Plaza Mall off Westshore, north of Kennedy Boulevard next to Maggianos Little Italy, PF Chang's Chinese Bistro, and Michelle's Fish Market. Besito's happy hour runs Monday through Friday 4PM-630PM and includes $5 chicken tacos, mushroom squash blossom quesadillas, shrimp tamales, organic wild mushroom empanadas with goat cheese and fish tacos. For Happy hour, Besito also serves a $5 pomegranate tangerine house margarita, classic blue agave blanco Margarita, Johnny Walker Red, Tanqueray, Cruzan, Smirnoff, Jim Bean, Dos Equis Amber, Cigar City Jai Alai, Agave Wheat, Negra Modelo, Sangria, and Sycamore Lane wines. We sat at the bar and our server took a little longer than average to greet us. We were almost going to leave but our server greeted us after about 8min. After that, our server was pretty quick and courteous. The food, chips and salsa, and parting gifts all came out in a timely manner. Besito's serves complimentary chips and salsa for an appetizer, a churro for dessert, and gives you a parting gift. Our parting gift, the Mexican worry doll, was supposed to absorb all our worries away which is a nice thought.  Maybe it can pay my bills for me too lol. I was dissapointed with the salsa as it was bland and not smokey like Catrinas or oregano spiced like Miguel's or even mild jalapeno spiced like Green Lemon. There was absolutely no kick, flavor, jalapenos or hint of any hot sauce in the salsa. Our table shared the guacamole which I thought was a bit of a rip for $10, but when I saw a server freshly preparing it table-side and tasted it, it was definitely worth a try. I have to admit, it's a bit of a gimmick and gets everyone's attention and so everyone else orders it who's around someone that does. Ive never been a huge fan of guacamole with chips. I'd rather have it on a Taco or have a decent salsa with my chips. For the entree, I ended up getting the 3 grilled fish tacos and they were pretty good portion size for $5. However, unfortunately Besito's only has one kind of hot sauce and its a home-made scorching-hot habanero that is so hot it burns your tongue and lips. After the 20 second delay for the spice to kick in, the tacos were not easy to put down. I really wish they had a larger variety of mild, hot, and nuclear sauces to match the home made scorching hot habanero. Do I really need to bring a decent hot sauce from home to a Mexican restaurant to enjoy their Mexican food or get their food to go to adequately enjoy it?  The decor of the place is rustic and dark with dark wood floors, cool pirate of the carribean style light fixtures, high table tops in the bar area, and comfy booths in the main dining area. There is plenty of parking available in the mall parking lot although it can be a challenge to find parking near the restaurants. 3 fishes tacos for $5 is a hell of a value at less than $2 a Taco that can't be overlooked. So if I do come again, it will be to get the tacos to go but I'm not sure if their special is dine in only.  Management, for the love of God please stock some basic green and red cholula hot sauces like any self respecting Mexican restaurant has lol.",

  "text": "Habits are difficult to break but during a stay in Marigny I one day chose to walk out my front door and bear left rather than right.  This decision would take me further from the French Quarter and deeper into Marigny.  It would take me into Bywater as well, and I'd stumble upon places that felt almost magical, as they were so unexpected.  \n\nCrescent Park was discovered when I scaled a steep, staired arch off Chartres.  It led me not only to a captivating view of the Mississippi, but also to a moody, grey relic: a wooden pier, the shell of a building.  Amongst all this cool grey sat two Milennials, staring not at their phones but engaged in a  game of Yahtzee.  The whole place felt like now but also like long ago; I'd opened a portal to the past.  \n\nCrescent Park, if entered from the Piety Street Bridge (aka Rusty Rainbow), is one special experience, but it's not always entered from here.  It's actually a park with a walking path that hugs the river for 1.4 miles with many points of entry.  None will be quite as magical as this but the Piety Street Bridge, if you can scale it, is the optimal point of entry if you appreciate drama and history.   \n\nDone, I scaled the arch back out of Crescent Park and rolled into Euclid Records (cool place) then to the biergarten which sits beside it.  Every portal to the past should sit beside a German biergarten and a vinyl record store but only one does.  If you're in NOLA I urge you to enter Crescent Park from this spot.  It borders on magical.  \n\n*  For more on the park and the bridge, enjoy this article from 2014, when this area debuted:  https://www.nola.com/arts/2014/02/crescent_park_on_new_orleans_r.html",

So here is a new one.\n\nWe have been to a number of shows put on by Reno-Tahoe Comedy.  Justin Rupple was the best of the shows we have seen.  Funny club comic that knows how to work a crowd.  The shows are all run pretty well, think locally run though.  Not all slick and smoothly ran.  In fact last night they had a \"Bachelor\" back out at the last minute and someone from the audience stepped up.  It made for a great show, but might seem a little hokey to some.  I love the home grown feel of the place.  Rubbin elbows with funny people and passionate people makes me feel more connected to the community and the people in it.\n\nThe space they use at the Pioneer Underground is cool.  Everyone can see and there is even a small row of \"comedy show\" tables as well.  The bar prices are good, I just never seem to have an alcohol appetite when I am catching a show at the Underground.\n\nI did love how they bumped a handful of loud girls talking back to the comedian last night.  They wouldn't shut up and the house was on it pretty quick.  They still wouldn't shut up so they were asked to leave.  So many people come to these shows expecting it to be about them.  Good on Reno Tahoe Comedy for knowing where to draw the line and holding that line.\n\nIf you aren't a stair person, you may want to check ahead of time by calling someone because it seems the only way in is down a huge set of stairs.  \n\nAll in all, friendly local people running this and giving us some good flavor to our nights in downtown Reno.  I will be back often.",

However, Bricks is as cool as the other side of the pillow!\n\nBricks has it all. Upon entering there's a coffee bar to the left, followed by a grown up bar. To the right there's ample seating containing booths and tables. And towards the back of the bar, it looks as if they have enough room for live music. Obviously, there are brick walls - score! It's dark inside, hence no picture uploads from me. Bricks is a place to be seen in downtown Ybor. I really dig this type of atmosphere.\n\nThe Tuesday special was $3 cans. About ten very good beers to choose from: Uinta Hop Nosh, Red Brick Laughing Skull and Founders All Day come to mind. The ten drafts on hand contained mostly local offerings which had my approval. Our friend asked the bartender to \"surprise him\" with a whiskey cocktail. We all sampled it and were instantly impressed. It even had a frothed egg!\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our experience here. The bartenders were friendly and cool. They didn't pressure us to order more rounds. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any of the food. By the looks of it, I'd definitely take a crack at it. If I'm in Ybor again, you'll find me here!",

Stayed here for 3 nights in room #237. 2 Queen Beds and an elegant sofa bed from West Elm.\n\n\nThe lobby is very open and welcoming. The front desk is filled Chupa Chups lollipops! My favorite is the chocolate/vanilla. It's free! It was one of the kind treats that makes you feel so welcome. \n\n\nThere is also cold water in the lobby and hot coffee by the elevator.\n\n\nOne of the best things that I enjoyed here is the breakfast that served. I don't know what time they start serving but I do know when they end. One the weekends they stop serving breakfast at 10am. Weekdays 9am.\n\nIt's free. It's part of the perks for staying here. \n\nBreakfast Food as follows: \n\nWaffle Station: whipped cream, strawberries, and syrup. Get creative, they have nuts and fresh fruit like bananas and single serving of Nutella!\n\nEgg Bowl Station: scrambled eggs, spinach, salsa, cheese, and various hot sauce!\n\nMeat: I think they alternate it daily from sausage to ham. Hot Oatmeal Bar with plenty of choices for toppings: raisins, cranberries, pecans, walnuts, brown sugar, granola.\n\nBread station: croissants, bagels, wheat bread, pastries... They have a toaster for you too! What to top your bread: cream cheese, peanut butter, Nutella, butter, honey.\n\nDrinks: House Coffee, Dark Coffee,with a selections of various creamers. Hot Tea from Earl Grey, Lemon, Green Tea, English Breakfast, and they are gourmet choices.\n\nDairy Bar: theres fridge stocked with Greek Yogurt, Activia, Milk, and Soy/Almond choices.\n\nJuice Bar: apple, orange, cranberry. \n\n\nConsidering that breakfast his is part of your room fee, so worth the stay! The staff that is running the breakfast stations are all very friendly and will even offer to clean up and take used plates from your table.\n\n\nThe room.... The bed is spacious considering it's a queen. The extra bed in the room is a sofa. You can easily make the couch a sleeping area and right below it... it's a trundle bed. Ask for extra twin sheets, pillows and blankets. We had 5 girls on this trip. We only came back to the room to sleep and took advantage of exploring the city!\n\n\nOne issue we had was the late night party room in the street facing room #237. It's expected. We are in New Orleans. It barely sleeps. Alot of parties here!\n\n\nThe lobby also has a gift shop and they sell alcohol, ice cream, chips, and other good stuff to snack during your stay.\n\n\nDefinitely recommending this place for anyone staying in New Orleans!",

Don't know, but when mixed with sausage, potato, onion, peppers, all wrapped up in an fresh egg case, they become an amazing sensory explosion.  \nTrenton may have seen better days (we have been waiting for its resurgence since it was \"Americas Town\" in the 60's), but Pat's carries on.\nDiners are only partially about the food, and the rest about the concept, design, and lustful loyalty they inspire. \nPat's is a worthy contender for the Urban Diner List on Yelp* (If there is one). \nGive it a try. \nSit at the counter and watch professionals do their thing. Sit at a window and see a worldview that captures the past-its-prime city, the capital of the Garden State, remind you that... We Are Still Here.",

  "text": "Zero Stars.\n\nBelieve every review below mine when you are booking through a partnered site (Expedia in our case). At the time we booked months ago, it was a Ramada and Expedia noted they were pet friendly, and the Ramada website noted they were pet friendly. We even called to confirm.\n\nThen they became a Quality Inn. A Quality Inn by some housing projects and a stadium. When we checked in,we noted we had a dog and they weren't pet friendly so we promptly checked out. The staff wasn't exactly nice about it. They said we should contact Expedia to get our money back, because they had a long line of people looking to check in and wanted us out.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, we booked at the Aloft in town. \n\nOn our way out we had to take a different exit, cause two housekeeping staff were fighting in the hallway and had it blocked. When it came time to ask for our money back from Expedia, the hotel told Expedia we had not checked out and stayed the whole weekend. Now the charges are being disputed on our credit card.\n\nThe only thing this hotel has got going for it is the guitar shaped pool. The staff is unwelcoming, the hotel is in a crap location. If you're looking for a great hotel and travelling with a dog, I suggest the better located Aloft downtown.",

It absolutely ruined my experience. I think this is a franchise of the French Quarter location. The Beignets didn't even taste as good.\n\nDo yourself a favor and skip this location for either the French Market original Stand or this other Coffee Company behind the mall across the highway. You know the name.\n\n I did buy a can of coffee and chicory\n here and I'm drinking it at home and with the right ratio of boiling milk to strong coffee, it is absolutely delicious and the same as what you get at the original Stand in the French Quarter.",

There is but one elevator serving all four floors which, during my stay, broke down trapping several occupants inside but only for a matter of a few minutes. However, they found the experience unpleasant and made everyone in the lobby aware of just how upset they were by it. \n\nThere is a self serve, sort of a Hampton Inn copy of a breakfast from 8 until 11 o'clock, which are far better hours than found in most places and the dinner are is large enough, spotless and well positioned on the ground floor.\n\nThe rooms are large spacious and rather well appointed. Their ice machine is located on the second floor, so get ready for a journey if you are on another floor.\n\nI've stayed at a lot of Best Westerns, and most of them are better. The only reason this one even exists is nearby Widener College, otherwise I'm certain it would not be here. The staff, however, is some of the best, particularly their shuttle drivers, some of whom are students at Widener. \n\nAlso, a downside of being a college hotel is that you can expect a lot of noise and college partying, not only from the students but even more from some of their elderly but ever partying their alumni; particularly from those left or still surviving from the days in which Widener was known as Pennsylvania Military College.

The food is Shanghai and Taiwanese cuisines .... and a good idea is probably to order something from both of these Chinese culinary traditions.  The one appetizer you must try without a doubt are the incredible beef scallion pancakes from Taiwan.  With beef, scallions, and an oyster sauce inside - you will not want to share them with anyone else at your table.  You want to eat them all yourself! \nAnd to add to the great dining experience at this restaurant, the service was extremely attentive and friendly.\n\nWith the current Korean chicken craze in full flame, I'm planning on coming back to Shanghai 1 to try their Taiwanese lightly salted chicken.  Everyone tells me it is really tasty.  Judging by what I've already eaten at this restaurant, I believe it!",

They even had put out already folders mailing boxes to help people just stuff their items in the boxes and head right to the check out counter. This office has an automated postal center as well if you like self service or need to mail something after hours. I was also surprised to see that they had a copying machine  just in case you needed to make copies of whatever you're mailing before you mail it. They also have tape that you can use to seal a priority mail packages. This has got to be one of the few post offices that still offers free tape, even if it's just for priority packages.",

I would never put Toucan Charlie's in the same boat as The Buffet @ The Wynn or Bellagio's, but it was definitely better than places like Treasure Island.\n\nSo if you're really hungry and looking for some prime rib like me, then stop by Toucan Charlie's.

My only gripe was that there wasn't very much meat on the chicken plate. For $12 bucks there were only 5 small pieces of chicken amid the sea of salad, hummus and pita. But, what was there was definitely memorable.\n\nI should also note, for families coming with small kids, there is only 1 high chair for the entire food court dining area. We got lucky and snagged it right away but I can see how this could be an issue on busy days. I would definitely recommend bringing a stroller with a tray just in case.",

  "text": "Setting expectations may be a key element in outcome for diners here.  This is not a Korean restaurant with grill for meats.  This is a Korean noodle house.  There is a difference in format for a noodle house and a full tilt restaurant whether in South Korea (says my hubby who spent a week there) or in the US (says both of us who have visited both in cities like Oakland and San Francisco).  This is also a true \"Mom and Pop\" owned by a  Korean couple who also own a Boise sushi restaurant.  All of the cooks in the kitchen, who include the owner on some days, are Korean.\n\nWhether that makes this truly authentic for purists I do not know because while I enjoy the flavors of Korean food it is not a cuisine about which I know enough to have any validity as food critic.  But I'll share that on our first visit at late lunch hour, among seven diners were young men of Korean heritage in casual business attire and sporting ID badges who seemed to be very much enjoying their bowls of noodles as they spoke in native language. \n\nI offer up the above as counterpoint to the food criticism offered in other reviews.  And for our experience at lunch which leads to four star outcome by putting all of this in the context of noodle house in Boise Idaho, the details follow.  While the location of this makes it unlikely that we will return often, when we're craving a good bowl of Korean noodles we will certainly go back.\n\nVIBE\nSerene and pleasantly disjointed.  As in the counterpoint of big white paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling and traditional silkscreen art on the walls against two big, flatscreen TVs with sound off (thankfully) showing a sporting event.  As in the spartan tables and chairs in the room and booths lining the wall (seating was comfy) against the backdrop of calming music on the sound system, both classic and classical with strings and keyboard.  We liked it.  It fit in the way it might if a screen writer were setting the stage.  From our view, they could lose the televisions but different strokes.\n\nHOSPITALITY & SERVICE\nWe were greeting warmly by a beautiful young Korean woman, given our choice of seating and immediately brought menus and water.  Our server was friendly and efficient and knew the menu very well to answer our questions.  Food was prompt out of the kitchen and served nice and hot, separate dishes were offered to use for sharing even without our asking for them and she checked in with us about our meal at the just right interval.\n\nMENU\nA large format menu of multiple pages, maybe six, with libations (several beers by bottle, a few options of wine and soft drinks) in front and food following.  Choices include condiments (yep, kimchi - $2 -  and it is house made), wok style noodles dishes and soup like noodle dishes (ranging from $9 - $13), rice options and entrees.  Lots of seafood choices on the menu and several dishes are vegetarian or can be made so.  Good options for omnivores and vegetarians alike with gluten free choices shown as well.\n\nFOOD & VALUE\nWe selected Anger Management noodles. (We have been wrestling with having a house designed and we needed some intervention but that's a long story of a \"First World Problem\".)  This is a wok styled noodle dish made with gochujang, a Korean fermented hot chili paste that is one of my favorites in Korean food, and we selected the vegetable option (other options include beef, pork and chicken).  It was delicious, the noodles and veggies both perfectly cooked and fresh jalapenos on top were a nice touch.  It was an ample size to be shared at good value price of $9.  We also shared lettuce wraps from the appetizer menu, offered in option of chicken or tofu priced at $6.  This is an entirely different flavor profile than that of Asian chicken lettuce wraps more familiar to most at Chinese food restaurants.  It was delicious but the rub is the iceberg lettuce leaves were served dripping wet and we had to pat them down with our paper napkins on the table.  A pet peeve of mine.  We also ordered kimchi to go ($2) to enjoy at home.  Total lunch for two at $17 seemed like a good deal to us for the quality and quantity.\n\nTHIS N THAT:\n\n1) LOCATION & PARKING: Boise seems full of these ugly and poorly designed (for traffic flow in parking lot) strip malls like the one in which Noodle Korea is located.  Don't hold the location against them.\n\n2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Lot has two accessible parking spaces.  Path of travel on sidewalk between them and Noodle Korea is blocked by chairs and sign of next door yogurt shop.  They are moveable.  Level in at Noodle Korea and throughout.  All standard height seating and booths are also transferable.\n\n3) HOURS OF SERVICE TIP:  If you enjoy \"linner\", late lunch as dinner, a note that they are open for lunch from 11a to 2:30p then close until dinner service at 5:00.  Not open straight through.",

The interior is very nice- rustic painted cement floor and walls that look like various reclaimed boards.

Subtle  suggestions - a drink from the bar, \"we have a great bartender.\"  Or an appetizer or two while looking the menu over. She saw my indecision and said take your time, I'll bring the drinks. For a new restaurant she seemed to know the menu pretty good and made a couple of suggestions. One two sided menu has sandwich, burger $10-14, salad $9-15 and small plate choices $9-14. The second menu had more of a dinner selection - ribeye $20, pasta $13, and lamb chop $18. The food arrived on, my personal favorite, HOT plates. My three tacos were so stuffed you couldn't fold them in half and tender beef, fresh crisp cabbage and a creamy cool cilantro sauce. Hubby enjoyed the rigatoni with mushrooms and chicken in a cream sauce.  \n\nA nice variety of wines from $5 to $11 a glass and also available by the bottle. Also a reasonable beer list. \n\nOf coarse Charlotte returns with a final suggestion and tease of some decadent sounding desserts. Next time, we were just too full. \n\nWill  absolutely be returning there were several other items we really wanted to try.",

And these travel arrangements includes picking you up from your hotel, driving to the Santa Ynez Valley, visiting 4 wineries and a stop by Solvang!!!\n\nThanks to Shawn, we got picked up at our hotel in Santa Barbara and got a lovely scenic ride to Santa Ynez. We visited four wineries and got discounted deals on wines with most of them just because of our tour with Wine Edventures!\n1. Koehler's which was simply gorgeous, despite the grape vines not in bloom quite yet!\n2. Buttonwood\n3. Presidio which is at Solvang! AKA I was able to stop by a nearby bakery, Mortensen's, to get some goodies!\n4. Shoestring: which so happens to also have horses by their vineyard!\n\nI LOVED that we didn't have to worry about driving and finding wineries to visit. And the lunch provided was between a Veggie Sandwich or Turkey Sandwich, which came with chips, a homemade cookie, and pasta salad. I felt quite full. And don't fret, water was provided given that we'll be consuming quite the amount of wine! \n\nShawn, our tourguide, was very funny, saracastic and very informative. I loved his pop quizzes and that he pointed out Michael Jackson's home, which was far off in the distance. I must say, Wine EDventures was definitely an EDucation!\n\nAlso, the ride in the tour bus was quite comfortable and spacious. I especially loved the scenery of the Pacific and Santa Ynez hills! GORGEOUS I tell you! \n\nIf you plan to go on a wine tour.. do it with WINE EDVENTURES!!! If you don't want to do it in a big group (there was a total of 17 of us in the tour I went on), then you can definitely have a private tour too! CHEERS!",

  "text": "Today is Lynne's last day in business and the health(ier) food segment of the Nashville food scene is poorer for it. I don't know the details behind the closure but I know that this was the Chad's decision and not something that was forced. Whatever the reason, I will miss coming here.\n\nIn addition to the delicious food/juice options, I'll miss the good conversations and vibes at the store. In the four years LL was in East End, it became a meeting place for neighborhood folks. I met/made friends there and would find myself engaging in all manner of conversations ranging from politics to music to events. LL became a neighborhood staple and somewhere I truly loved patronizing. Add to this, there's no other business like it in East End. None. In East End. It's odd, right? What's going to fill the vacuum? Lockeland Springs' The Post East is a coffee shop that sells packaged juice but it's not a juice shop. Edgefield's The Turnip Truck sells made-to-order juice but doesn't sell acai bowls, avocado toast, etc. It's a grocery, not a juice shop. One would think, given the demographic of the area, something would rush in to fill the void. Not so much. Not now. Until then, I big LL a fond farewell. Thanks for helping me to eat better and to stop and take some minutes to engage with real people in real conversation face to face. There were levels to this health thing, y'all.",

  "text": "Went to Jackson's Bistro for lunch. I loved half of my meal and hated the other half. Started of with the miso soup which was horrible. The tofu in the soup was of low quality and the soup was overcrowded with shitake mushrooms and white scallion strips that were impossible to eat in the soup. I appreciate the attempt to give the soup a modern twist, but it just didn't work.  \n\nThe sushi was good, but I have had better in Tampa. We ordered the Spicy Tuna roll, the Lava roll, and the Ying Yang roll. The spicy tuna roll was as expected, very fresh tuna.  The Ying Yang roll was pretty good also, but I probably wouldn't order this one again because I find white tuna bland. The Lava roll was tasty with the exception of the baked dynamite on top. I would have preferred a lightly seared fish on top; the \"dynamite\" tasted a like warm canned tuna...yuck!\n\nFor dessert our table split a very disappointing piece of chocolate cake. (I see why it was removed from the menu.) We considered the strawberry dessert we saw a waiter carrying, but I changed my mind when our waiter informed us the strawberries weren't fresh.\n\nOur waiter was attentive at first; always pouring refills before our glasses were empty.  At the end of our meal our waiter disappeared to wait on another table so we had to wait 20 minutes before he finally charged our credit card. This would have been understandable if the restaurant was busy, but the restaurant was dead quiet.\n\nOverall the food was hit or miss, but at least we got to enjoy a pretty view of the water and downtown Tampa while we dined.  Due to the lackluster food and high prices I would not go out of my way to dine here again.",

The place has been refreshed since it was \"One,\" with a light gray Nantucket feel with open kitchen. I've been here 6 times and each has been a hit. The complimentary Parker house rolls are divine and dishes are seafood-centric but don't forget about the steak frites which has become a favorite with my husband. My favorite dish this far is the gnocchi with meat ragu, pine nuts, raisins and peccorino. Sometimes there are complimentary truffles and don't forget the \"Oysters Goodenough.\"",

The only downside is that there doesn't seem to be an actual view, which you usually expect from a rooftop bar.

It's very open and easy to navigate around even when there is a huge crowd. Just be mindful that the crowds are dense and contained in this big open area in the bar and bathroom hall which is separate from the concert hall.\n\nGood food and drinks are offered at reasonable prices without breaking the bank. I was very content with this considering this was not what I expected going in.\n\nOverall experience was solid. Best piece of advice I can give and be prepared to wait in line outside and do not bring too much with you. They'll screen you before entering and turn you away if you've got something they'd authorize not fit for their venue.",

  "text": "After a busy Sunday of giving massages, I decided I wanted to meet with a friend for some Girl Time.  Since she's starting down the road of veganism and Me, I'm a meat eater, we decided that Thai food was the best middle ground.   And since I was working in Dunedin and she was coming from St. Pete, she spun the urban spoon and this is where it landed. \n\nThe outside of the place is fine, looking a little brash with it's neon lights, but inside, there is a soft glow of serenity.  The floors were all neat and clean and the table set up, while tight was comfortable.  We were sat in the first alcove and waited for our waiter.  \n\nHere is where things took a not so pleasant turn, when he came to the table, it was from the outside, as if he was called in from his smoke break, and took our orders; for Jasmine tea and Thai Coffee with ice water.  It was returned quickly enough but he forgot the ice water.  Any question we asked was answered almost snappishly, and almost unintelligibly. \n\nOur orders were placed, mine is what I always order, Chicken Sateh & Combo fried rice, she placed an order for curry puffs and some vegetable dish.  As if to prove that he wasn't listening, he had to come back out and get my order a second time. This did not fill me with confidence.  And when our starters came out, I did not get the chicken sateh, but rather, beef.  I did not complain, but ate it. I'd never had beef sateh, and it was OK, but it was NOT chicken, which is by far a more lovely dish. \n\nWhen our mains were served, I noticed that my combo fried rice was served, not with the traditional beef, chicken and pork, but with scungili and shrimp. Apparently the seafood that he'd told her would be in her vegi dish, wound up in my rice. It was terribly confusing.  I don't eat seafood, but I ate around it, because I didn't clarify what was in their fried rice, this was on me. \n\nNow, their food is fresh, it is tasty and it comes out fast. My only fault with this place was our waiter's inattentive attitude and the fact that he really didn't pay attention to what he was doing. It was clear he would have been any other place than serving us at our table, and it showed. \n\nThe high point of our meal? The Thai custard and sticky rice with coconut sauce, it truly was delicious and we thanked him for recommending it to us to try. It brought both of us back to Hawaii.",

Not only did an impressive amount of people come in for a Thursday night, but I loved learning more about Indian food in this casual environment and witnessing other people learn the same (and then LOVE their food).\n\nI'll set the scene: we snagged a seat in an Indian-style 'cart-themed' booth. So fun. Then you go up to the counter and order your food, fast-casual style. You can choose either a rice bowl, naan sandwich or naan pizza (how cool are those combos?!). I got a rice bowl, added tandoori chicken, saac curry (blend of leafy greens), tomatoes/carrots/cilantro, and mango chutney. WOW - that mango chutney really added a next level to the dish (highly recommend). The saac curry was the least spicy option, yet I still thought it was pretty spicy so couldn't finish my entire dish but.... man I wish I could handle spice better because it was delicious. \n\nI saw other people with a naan sandwich and the naan pizza and it looked incredible. Can't wait to try the pizza. They also sell mango lassis and ice cream. \n\nI also heard that this restaurant started with a kid who had the idea to start the restaurant while in college. Very cool story and I'm happy that it truly was so good so we can continue to support this place!",

Stopped by with my husband recently and was thoroughly impressed with the design of the location, the extensive wine list, the flexibility of tasting options, the welcoming staff who is very knowledgeable and excited to give their guests the best experience possible, and the delicious menu items available for purchase.\n\nYou can stop by here for light bites and a glass of wine, an extensive tasting where you can choose the volume of the tastes you want, can order a flight of wine (try the sparking wine flight) or a bottle or two to go. With regards to picking up a bottle or two, this is a great place to pick up wine bottles on your way to dinner at a family/friends house or to a local BYOB and why not have the opportunity to taste it before you buy it! We will definitely be back and look forward to trying their wine lists as it continues to change with new additions and exciting wines to try.\n\nYou can also purchase a Wine Card, load it with a dollar amount of your choice, and purchase sips by the glass at their wine tasting machines - note this is on hold for the safety of the customers due to Covid-19. Love this idea and can't wait for it to be fully available when safe to do so.\n\nHighly recommend making reservations but walk-ins are accepted as well.

I'm from CA, and the one we have has pizza unless it was a recent thing where they no longer serve pizza. Ordered the chicken marsala (which was yummy) and a new entre cannelloni Bolognese (which I wasn't a big fan of, I thought it would have more meat, but it was basically a cheese and spinach Italian cheesy omelette with some meat sauce spooned on top). Salad to-go was room temperature, lettuce was soft and limp and not fresh and crispy. \n\nPARKING: outside parking shared with a big outside shopping area across from Petco and a Brewing Co. \n\nOUTSIDE: location itself is nice in a well developed shopping/restaurant area. Your typical look of a Macaroni Grill. Lots of outside seating on their wrap around patio. Refer to my photos. Nobody was sitting outside though, which was too bad since the weather was nice. I like how to the right of the front door there are nice benches and shade in case you need to wait for a table or for your to-go food. \n\nINSIDE: like all Macaroni Grills, darker ambiance, but setup and décor was the same. Bar on the left. Hostess counter straight ahead of you. Double door entrance as you come in with a second door to open. \n\nOVERALL: A-OK. Nice that they have to-go option and curbside to-go option. I was disappointed about the cannelloni, but even more disappointed about the salad. Usually salads are chilled.",

If you're into old architecture, you need to visit the Indiana Repertory Theatre just to check out the beautiful terrazzo flooring and the art deco-style touches that are in every corner of the building. I point out the terrazzo flooring because I love a good terrazzo floor, so when you're at the theatre, look down to admire the beautifulness. \n\nWe visited the Indiana Rep to see a children's play, and all the kids were invited to sit on the floor. Even though I'm not a kid, I sat on the floor too, and it really made me feel a part of the action. The actors were jumping, dancing, running and singing from every part of the room, so we were constantly turning our heads to see what was going on. But that's a good thing, because I felt like it kept the kids (and me) involved in the story. For all the floor-sitters, the theatre provided us with seat cushions, which made the sitting a lot more comfortable.\n\nMy children loved their theatre experience here at the Indiana Reperatory Theatre, and I'm hoping to come back soon to see another children's performance!",

  "text": "A friend of mine shot me a text saying I had to eat at Acme Oyster House since she knew I was in the Big Easy. Of course I looked it and found the other location in the French Quarter. The line was out the door. No thanks. I parked my car at Harrahs and found this location. It was meant to be I suppose.\n\nI kind of figured that no matter what, this location would be a little subpar to whatever was going on at the other location since this was inside of the casino, but I figured I'd still give it a try.\n\nI ordered a lot because I wanted to really see if I liked it here. For starters I got the half Po-boy with fries and a side of coleslaw. The sandwich only comes with one side so the slaw was extra. Then I ordered six charbroiled oysters, because this was the main reason I was to come here.\n\nThe service was alright. One girl working the register and one cook. The poor girl was ringing people up and delivering food as well which delayed things.\n\nI sat down and waited for my food. First came the Po-boy. The half was huge. It looked more like a whole to me, and thank goodness I didn't order the whole because it would have been entirely too much food. The fries and slaw were great, but I didn't love the Po-Boy. It was ok, but just that- ok.\n\nI was finished with my meal and still didn't have my oysters and finally they arrived. Wow. Now looking back on it, I should have just ordered these. The oysters were amazing; cheese and lemon- yum! They were absolutely delicious. They were hot and still bubbling when they arrived and I ravaged the plate.\n\nNext time I'm in town I want to go to the real location and order the same thing to see how the real place stacks up against this version. I'm sure it's even better.",

  "text": "I work less than 8 minutes walk from the Italian Market.  Probably could make it here in 5 minutes, but I walk like a sloth - S  L  O  W.  I like to blame this pace on my penchant for stopping to take random photographs, but no, I'm just  S L  O  W.  A blind 89 year old man in a wheelchair with only 1 arm to propel himself could outpace me, but I digress.\n\nMy friend Michael T, the Reno Yelp CRM, has been on my mind lately as I've noticed a few places claiming to have the best roast pork sandwiches in Philly.  Thought I'd give this place a shot and I'm glad I did. It's a tiny tiny divey shop, obviously run by a tight knit gang who have to juggle doing everything within 6 inches of each other.\n\nMy sandwich was promptly delivered to me 3 minutes after I ordered it. I sat on the tiny counter on a tiny stool and ate my giant sandwich which was around $7.  It could've been 2 meals! Of course, I loved the bread and the juicy pork dripping with flavor. Skipped the rabe (sorry!) and shoulda added provolone cheese, but a girl's gotta watch her already curvy curves.",

It was a pretty cool salon.  They had lots of hair products but also makeup and accessories.  I didn't quite like my haircut or the deep conditioning results, but I would try Leslie again.

She had us so preoccupied and laughing that as we left we forgot to leave her the rest of the cash we meant to leave her.

  "text": "Eating outside Santa Fe on a nice summer night with my boyfriend reminds me of a great R&B video. A love story, with a couple sitting outside wooing each other. The candles are dimly lit, but the mere sight of them makes you melt. The salsa dip is..NO WORDS..that great. I like cilantro. No, I love cilantro. Santa Fe does a great job of preparing the salsa dip with just enough cilantro. Careful with the chips & salsa, the 2nd round is on you ha!ha!\n\nI am a margarita, mojito, lemondrop diva! The margarita was so refreshing. I can't think of any other adjective to describe it. The drink did not disappoint Elle. Eating outside around people from all over the world makes me feel good. My boyfriend swears by the softshell crab taco. It lit him up. I did enjoy it as well. There are so many obvious choices when viewing the menu. I would challenge you to try something new. I love trying new stuff at magnificent restaurants like Santa Fe. If you don't like what you order, SWALLOW it..LOL no seriously, you will definitely enjoy it.",

We didn't have reservations, but he had said that he would be there so it wouldn't be a problem.\n\nI called Stuart as we were leaving, and left a message saying we were on the way.  I was a little concerned when I didn't hear back from him, and it was drizzling slightly when we got close to the area.  But he was so friendly and positive when I talked to him the day before, that I figured it would be fine.\n\nWhen we got there, two girls were scheduling whale watching boat trips, and were very friendly, but told me that Stuart wasn't there.  They tried to call him on the number I had, as well as his partner, and couldn't reach either of them.\n\nWe left and figured we would come back the next day, and that we would get a call back at some point.\n\nUnfortunately, Stuart never called me back.  : (\n\nI'm open to trying him out another time, and raising the stars - but it would have been nice if he would have returned my call - especially after being so friendly on the phone and surely hearing my message that we were heading out to him.\n\nThe upside:  we took an AWESOME ultralight flight along the coast from Sky Rider Ultralight in Camarillo instead!!  Woooohooooo!!",

  "text": "Say adios to Mangroves, and hello to Sunova Beach, which is the newest addition to the SoHo/Courier City bar and restaurant scene.  Why replace a bar/restaurant with another?  I'm not sure what the answer is, but just by walking into Sunova Beach, I think I know the answer; Fresh and new and beach bar, mostly beach bar.  It's the one vibe SoHo doesn't provide in it's many bars and eateries.  WoB is beer snobbish, Cheap is pseudo-swanky, Drynk is douche-baggish, MacDinton's is a fake-ass Irish pub, SoHo Saloon is small and the Lodge is a little bit of everything.\n\nI really like what they've done with the place.  It seems more open now, and the place has definitely been brightened up.  As for the staff, we saw two people who rolled over from Mangroves at the bar, but everyone else was new--and you can tell.  A lot of the staff was lost somewhere between friendly and \"I don't know what I'm doing.\"  They just opened a few days ago, so it's gonna take some time for the rookies to get settled in, I suppose.  \n\nThe bar is full liquor with beer.  In this day and age of craft beerism, I was hoping that they would have a better selection though.  I think they had about 10 lines on their rail, and they were what you'd expect to see at perhaps Applebee's.  My suggestion would be for them to rethink their selections and try to specialize in more craft beers to set themselves apart from all the other bars in the area.  I skipped the beer and had Nathan whip up an old fashioned for me.\n\nAs for the food, it was decent.  There were 4 of us and we ordered nachos and a burger to split.  The nachos were pretty good, but small.  We ordered half chicken, half steak for sampling purposes.  I think we all agreed that the chicken was better due to how well-marinated and seasoned it was.  The burger though was pretty good.  It might be the best burger in SoHo.  10 ounces of flame-grilled deliciousness.  James Joyce is still the best in town, but the burger here is a good alternative if you don't feel like traveling to Ybor.\n\nHappy hour for drinks is daily from 3-7 PM.  As for the food menu, all but two shrimp dishes are under $10, so you won't break the bank chillin' out here.  The new indoor/outdoor bar area is great and I really like the atmosphere change to the area.",

  "text": "Why, hello, there, Pelican Bay, newest restaurant on Elysian Fields, purveyor of the absolute best frozen daiquiris in the city, not to mention fresh & delicious food prepared & served with much love. Check me out - FTR (First To Review) and first to set a 5-star precedence, I'm sure.\n\nStupid me, I didn't bring an appetite, just a thirst for a piña colada because I knew here they have it in the machine so I wouldn't tempt the stink eye from a bartender (I was that bartender once, I admit). Here, you can order any kind of frozen concoction you want because they have a wall of frozen drink machines glorious churning up the colorful sweet stuff. You might feel like a kid at buffet where you can mix & match Pepsi and Mt. Dew and even Dr. Pepper (I was that child once). They have all these varieties and then will do something outrageous like a Piña Colada/Hypnotiq parfait. I stuck to the classic piña and wow, it even tasted like it wasn't filled with that obvious artificial flavor that some daiquiri places typically use (Gene's version is not drinkable, I'm sorry). It's true that I normally shun the sweet boozy stuff but there's something about a hot New Orleans day and the way these days practically beg for frozen cocktails. I'm a believer now. And this is where I'll be getting my fix. Sunday fundays, here's looking at you! \n\nDespite not bringing an appetite, I wanted to try their veg black beans (perfection-- just the right texture and seasoning) and oh, I can never say no to homemade tortilla chips. So, yes, I ate. It's kind of impossible not to at Pelican Bay. Know that if you're a vegetarian there are options for you (and how cool is it that they have a separate fryer for veggies?) and they note what isn't vegan on the menu, too. When asked by chef/owner Tanzanika what they could do to make the menu more veg-friendly, I suggested having some tofu options, maybe (I just love tofu. I know it's crazy). She laughed but seems like she's open to the idea. It's not even really necessary and if you're open to dairy, they have pizzas that look really great, too. Their emphasis is on FRESH food and yes, they shop daily. My guy had a burger that he said tastes just like \"Mom's burger,\" which for him is a big compliment (for me, not so much. My mom's burgers possibly turned me off meat forever. Please don't tell her I mentioned it, K?)\n\nService is fantastic from the moment you open the door and are warmly welcomed. Our waiter couldn't be sweeter or more attentive and a special shout out to bartendress extraordinaire, Paris!\n\nIt's a slice of pure Southern comfort, friends. Get thee here immediately.\n\nPS. There can't be a better place in the city to watch Saints games and other sporting events. TVs galore!",

Beauty and elegance is always waiting to welcome you and your guests.\" Overall, this is a pretty accurate assessment of the space.

This is a magical (if, I presume, insanely expensive) place to have weddings (though the imaginary weddings I've attended at NOMA are prettier and more fabulous), and it's a good place to rest for a bit during Zoo to Do, if you get tired of wandering around in search of food, booze and music, or whatever it is that other people do at this event. \n\nThis is totally a venue I'd use for an event someday. In the meantime, I'll continue to enjoy attending other people's events in the Audubon Tea Room, and perhaps I'll see you there.",

  "text": "Is this the best Italian restaurant in Newtown? I think so.\n\nIs it the best in Bucks?  I could make an argument for it, but the real point is that it is so good that people who love Italian should give it a try. Back in the day I returned to Trenton to satisfy my Napoli needs, but those days are gone, and we all must find alternatives closer to home.\n\nPasquale is the owner/chef/creative genius of Vecchia Osteria.  He takes great pride in his cuisine, and oversees the details between being on the floor checking on his customers and making everyone feel welcome.  He can be generous.  Complimentary glasses of wine and cannoli are not uncommon.  In between, the courses are excellent and each taste follows on upon the one before building into a crescendo of taste, texture, and subtle overlay.  Maestro, please continue. \n\nLast week, VO was one of several local eateries to donate dishes a for large dinner in town.  They provided Chicken Cacciatore (white version), and Rigatoni Vodka, enough for 60 people.  The Chicken was dark meat with lots of Rosemary covering everything.  The meat and bone were easily parted, leaving a succulent light wine and vinegar sauce to bathe the dark chicken flavors.  It was superb.  The pasta was the larger rigatoni, which held the creamy tomato gravy in its grooves and ridges like they were born together.  It was a subtle tone so as not to compete with the more robust cacciatore.  Great combination.  I was sure to take some leftovers home to enjoy the next day, as Chicken Cacciatore becomes even more satisfying with age. \n\nI have eaten in Pasquale's house several times, and always wondered why I waited so long to return.  \n\nIt always exceeds my expectations.",

This is a part of the country club portion of the Ritz, so it's along the golf course and a little drive from the hotel itself. They are known for their savory burgers and mouthwatering milkshakes. We dined on the patio as the sun was setting and the weather was just about perfect. It's such a serene environment and they do an excellent job of creating a similar ambiance in the restaurant.\n\nWhile sitting by the fireplace, we both ordered burgers. I went for more of a classic burger with cheese and avocado and then we split the fries. Typically, you think, well a burger is a burger anywhere you go and so I wasn't expecting anything much different. However, there is absolutely something different about this burger. It had the perfect flavor and was just the right amount of juicy inside the brioche bun. It was hard not to gobble up every bite! For dessert, we splurged with their famous milkshakes. They come out in a glass, along with the metal milkshake container with extra shake.

The accompanying flat bread was fresh and delicious. \n\nAlthough good, here's where I think this entree offering had some shortcomings. If it's designed to be split by 2 people, including 3 poached eggs doesn't quite cut it. Does sharing 1 1/2 poached eggs per person really make sense? Same with the flatbread; it was one piece that was to be shared. We could have easily each ate our own piece. I've ordered Shakshuka at other restaurants and an order typically comes with 2 eggs. We left feeling a little underwhelmed. Fortunately, we weren't too hungry. Otherwise, this entree designed to be shared by two would have left us feeling under satisfied as well.",

AJs is so fabulous that I'm pretty sure people just cruise in there for an \"escape\" into all that is gourmet, specialty, delicious and downright picture perfect.

If you make it passed the flower shop make sure to check out the fresh fish and phenomenal beef counters. Here you can definitely buy high quality  choice and prime beef that will never disappoint. They even have grass-fed beef! \nDon't be discouraged by the high prices, because AJs has crazy good sales on the reg. For example, you can buy PRIME New York Steak for like $12.00/lb on sale versus the normal $28.00. \nTIP: Sales usually fall on holiday weekends.\n\nBeyond the beef counter is their delectable cheese section (my personal heaven), which has more than just your average triple cream bries and Manchego Cheeses. I've been lucky enough to score a truffled Pecorino! \n\nHungry while shopping? No Prob! You can munch on all kinds of house-made goodies like grilled veggies, grilled fish, rotisserie chicken,  potato salad, pasta salad, Orzo salad and more.\n\nor\n\nStop in an eat some fresh Sushi at the Sushi Bar. You know you're getting #1 sushi grade fish, with out a doubt!\n\nLike Pizza? check out the Pizza and Deli counter where you can order a custom sandwich or grab a slice. Then cruise over for some Illy coffee and sweets. \n\nAJs even has an outdoor grill, open daily until 3pm. They make a GOOD hot dog (with Brats) YUM!\n\nIt's best to go to AJs when you are not starving or without a game plan, because it can do a number on your wallet!\n\nLove you AJs!",

They're nothing short of amazing.\n\nAbsolutely spectacular beaches in St. Petersburg Florida and some of the best beaches in the whole state. I don't love them as much as I love Sarasota's Siesta Key but I still absolutely love them and most of them are Public Access, and you can't ask for much more than that in the Flo Rida.\n\nThese are indescribably gorgeous beaches and massive fancy hotels with dolphins on some of them - which I love - and they are almost exclusively caucasian, which is a shame, but you can't have everything. I look forward to the day when the St Pete crowd is more diverse... and the Gulf Coast in general.",

  "text": "The one thing I hate about vacation is when I find a spot that is \"the one!\" This restaurant is worthy of that title. \"Khyber Pass Pub\" was on a list of places to eat at in Philadelphia, so I made it my business to get here. From the outside it looks like a small bar, that if you walked to fast you may not even see it. But heading inside, judging by the loud music upstairs, I knew this is a very hip spot. It's low lit, with a comfortable vibe. It has two floors and a bar on each. Downstairs is the restaurant, where you can eat and socialize. Upstairs is where they have a live band, where you can dance the night away. But dancing would wait because I was hungry. When I got to the hostess stand, I was told to find a seat and I did. My waitress, Mikaela, came over and she was amazing. She was friendly and recommended all the best food. She joked about not knowing about them being on the best spot list. But after a short conversation I ordered the Mac & cheese to start. Those Mac balls were incredible! The were placed on a home made sauce that seemed to bring all the flavor out. I asked for a side of the sauce for my sweet potato fries it was so good. I told her I wanted the burger because it came highly recommend. That recommendation was on point. I didn't change anything about the burger, I got it according to the menu. I'm so glad I did. The beef was sensational, the bacon crunchy, and the dry cheese complimented the entire burger. Topped off with the pretzel bun and sautéed onions, and you got the best burger in Philadelphia. I will make it my point to come again. Atmosphere, food, and service! Who can beat that?",

  "text": "For some reason I didn't love this place. I ended up at this restaurant unexpectedly with a group but I must say that I had already planned to go to the original location in the Gulch the following day with family and that meal ended up being much better.\n\nSince the menu stated that the East Nasty was the best sandwich in America, we had to get it. In addition to multiple orders of that, we tried the biscuit and sausage gravy, chronic bacon, bonuts, hummingbird family reserve, cheese grits, and Alma's potatoes. \n\nWe started with bonuts, which were their biscuit donuts served with lemon mascarpone and blueberry compote. Ehhh...these didn't hit the spot for us. Although sugar was on them, they were not sweet. Hoping for better with the biscuit that was topped with similar ingredients used in hummingbird cake, we dug in to our other starter. The biscuit was covered with a pineapple and banana jam, along with cream cheese frosting and pecans. The description was definitely better than the taste. I think the drop biscuit just didn't work for this. Their sweet biscuit may have worked better.\n\nThe East Nasty was a biscuit topped with fried chicken, aged cheddar, and sausage gravy. The portion was huge so I was glad that I'd planned to share it. It was presented with the advertised ingredients but the gravy was just smothering the biscuit and chicken, making it very difficult to taste any of the components of the dish other than the gravy. The person who got the biscuit and gravy had a very similar issue. Had I known that they were so heavy handed on the gravy at this location, I would've asked for it on the side.\n\nThe small parts of the chicken that were peeking out from the gravy of the East Nasty had such thick fried skin, almost like tempura battering. I ended up with a half plate of skin that I removed to try to taste the chicken. I was also disappointed with the potatoes which needed some salt and pepper or some type of seasoning.\n\nThis meal was a miss for me until I tried the bacon that was sweet and sprinkled with a little pepper. I washed it down with the fruit tea. You can't go wrong with southern sweet tea and they added lemon, pineapple, and orange juice, which made it even better.\n\nMy advice is to go to the original location in The Gulch. I found the food to be better there and the chicken and biscuit wasn't so overwhelmed by the gravy.",

I had heard the history of the Natchez before, definitely worth learning about whether you're a tourist or a local.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how good the buffet was, and our server was extremely sweet. The dining room has this sepia-toned feel to it, with the band playing at the far end away from the diners. The band, Dukes of Dixieland, were seriously jamming so Robert and I took a spin on the empty dance floor. Though our dance fever didn't seem to be contagious, we received an applause at the end of the set. I don't suggest dancing RIGHT after you eat, but definitely get out on the floor. \n\nThere are a few levels that you can visit, and the Engine Room on the bottom floor is pretty cool, though I have a fear of touching what I'm not supposed to and crashing the boat. \n\nThere is an air of romanticism to leaning over the side of the boat while watching mammoth shadows of barges pass by in the night ever so closely. Though the ride stretches a little long, the view of the city on the way back is magical and definitely worth a few snap shots. Something to do at least once or twice as a local with friends or a loved one to reconnect with the Mighty. :)",

We couldn't resist.\n\nRobert provided an excellent experience from beginning to end.  There was cheese and crackers for us to nibble and he provided an umbrella for sun shade.

The online reservation system is quick and easy.  \n\nTip:  Try to make a reservation during a cooler period of the day.\n\nFinal Assessment:  Robert is friendly and professional.

Service was very prompt, and friendly throughout the meal, but the prices seemed a bit high for CBD lunch.\n\nI started with the soup special which was corn and crab bisque. It was excellent. While not loaded with a huge amount of crabmeat, the soup was very rich and flavorful. It was fairly priced at $5 for a cup.\n\nI ordered a burger as an entree with grilled onions and cheese. The burger alone was $11, and each additional item added another $1. The burger was perfectly cooked and very good, but $13 seems a bit high for a cheeseburger. The side of fries appeared to be hand cut and were very good. \n\nThe total bill was close to $45 for two people with the tip and no alcohol.",

  "text": "An interesting tour of New Orleans with a great guide. We did the afternoon tour of four neighborhoods, a cemetery, and a distillery. \n\nWe booked through one of the tourist spots in the French Quarter. The woman there was able to give us availability, book, and give us meet up information. Since our tour was on a holiday and the parade closed many downtown roads our meet up spot was an arbitrary intersection. Normally the bus can pick up and drop off at hotels. The tour was about two and a half hours with a stop for bathroom breaks in the middle.\n\nThe driving portion of the tour was great, especially since it was very cold the day we did our tour. Our guide was Rene and he gave us city information the entire time we were driving around the city. Some of the information was historical and some was interest like pointing out homes of famous residents. He kept the tour interesting.\n\nThe cemetery portion of the tour was interesting as well. It seems odd to go to a cemetery, but it is an important part of learning about the city. We were given about 10 minutes to walk around after Rene gave us information about the cemetery. \n\nThe last part of the tour was a stop at Seven Three Distillery. The distillery gave us a quick tour of the facility as well as a taste of their vodka or gin which in total lasted about 30 minutes. It was a nice distillery and a nice enough tour, but it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the tour. It would definitely be fun as part of a separate drinking themed tour. Maybe a new tour option idea that goes to local distilleries and breweries? \n\nOverall, a great way to see and learn about the city on a day too old to walk!",

El Charro has been in business since 1922 so they must be doing something right.  \n\nI sat at the bar and ordered a margarita while I perused the menu.  Carne seca looked interesting.  I've read about it but never tried it.  It's sun dried beef that's then shredded and cooked with onions, peppers and tomatoes; something like jerky reconstituted for tacos.  I have a rule for Mexican restaurants though which is \"I will judge you by your chile relleno.\"  What to do?  No worries.  I found a combo with both and made my request.\n\nChips and salsa were fine, with a nice little kick.  When my food arrived I was puzzled.  It was the carne seca plate and not the combo I ordered.  Okay, I'll take that, rather than send it back and wait.  My server apologized and comp'd the relleno I had been expecting.  She handled the mixup perfectly well.  \n\nCarne seca was described as a flavor explosion.  I definitely sensed a little bit of a pop.  It was flavorful and good in tacos.\n\nMy chile relleno was just okay.  Lots of cheese, not much of the crisp exterior I usually expect.  Red sauce was good.\n\nHouse margaritas; Pretty light.  No buzz.  No Bueno.  \n\nOverall, pretty good but I was disappointed with the margarita and relleno.",

Our waitress was LOVELY. She walked us through pretty much the whole menu as well as explaining some of the drink options as well. \n\nI started with a sake that the restaurant had on tap, which was wonderful. my husband tried one of their cocktails and then stuck with his favorite Manhattan after that. \n\nWe started with the okonomiyaki (a Japanese pancake, at Green Pheasant made with ham, bacon, scallops, potatoes, and various traditional okonomi toppings). It was good, but not my favorite thing we ate. Next we tried the shumai (at Green Pheasant, made with lobster and spot prawn - and served with clover ponzu) - these were okay, but definitely my least favorite thing we ordered (they had a slightly strange flavor to me, but that may be because I'm so used to shumai made with shrimp only). \n\nNext we had the spicy crab noodles (with crab butter, sweet red crab, and tobanjan), which were very good. Lots of crab on the dish, and it was just the right amount of heat! \n\nBut the Ikinari steak was my favorite of the appetizers or entrees we ordered! The steak was American skirt steak with corn and onion and miso brown butter and j sauce, served in a hot hot hot sizzle plate like is traditional at the Japanese steak restaurant chain Ikinari (picture a fajita platter at a Tex Mex restaurant). The steak was great (perfectly cooked); the corn and onions were charred where they had touched the hot sizzle plate; and the miso brown butter was just the right richness for the steak. I'd come back to Green Pheasant just to eat this again. A great dish.\n\nBut we didn't stop there. We ordered two of the desserts as well. I ordered the ginger creme brulee which was SENSATIONAL (I might be back at Green Pheasant again soon - I want to sit at the bar, order some sake or shochu, and eat the Ikinari steak and the ginger creme brulee. Quite simply one of the best desserts I've had recently. The ginger flavor was amazing, and the creme brulee was so smooth. I LOVED IT. My husband has about 10x the sweet tooth I do and he ordered the tempura fried slice of chocolate cake. I tried a teeny tiny bite, and it's just WAAAAAAY too rich and sweet for me, but he enjoyed it (definitely for people who love sweet, rich desserts only). \n\nWe had a couple more drinks (including a shochu cocktail that was DELICIOUS). The service was excellent, and the restaurant pretty nice (I do think sitting downstairs is probably nicer, because upstairs is pretty sparse compared to the decor on the main level). We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. I think we'll be back.",

I was saving my $50 gift certificate from Opentable (after months of making reservations for everything, finally, a payoff!) for a long time, and after careful consideration, decided on Sbraga for my birthday dinner (with a 9:00 reservation on a Monday that would get me another 1000 points, obviously).\n\nI had extremely high expectations... and they were exceeded, starting with the birthday card from Chef Sbraga that graced my table upon my arrival. The service was impeccable and everything we ate was incredible (I'll get to that later).\n\nI wasn't going to review Sbraga, but I recently revisited (free dinner courtesy of Opentable...it pays to read emails!) and realized I just can't stop talking about it or recommending it to people, so I should weigh in on the ole Yelp.\n\nTHE FOOD. \nOMG the food. Here are the highlights from my two visits.\n\n--The Foie Gras Soup. \nPerfect combination of richness and spice, and just awesome. I still think about this. I don't care if you don't like foie gras, never had it, or are iffy about. You should order this, and you will like it. I promise. \n\n--Pork Belly in Chili Oil\nVery thinly sliced, but great combination of flavors and not too spicy at all.\n\n--Gem lettuce...with other stuff.\nBasically a deconstructed Caesar salad. The red peppery looking things were really the highlight. Very good.\n\n--Steak tartar \nAlso awesome, can't remember specific details.\n\n--Octopus in Piri Piri sauce\nNot as spicy as other Yelpers led me to believe, so fear not; also excellent.\n\n--Papardelle was really good too.\n\n--The Lamb was very good but a bit salty for my taste.\n\n-- \"Key Lime Pie\"-kind of a deconstructed delicious take on the classic, and the Pistachio Bread Pudding with Olive Oil Ice cream (super interesting flavor, and my roomate who hates normally ice cream loved it!) Not a huge dessert person, but places like Sbraga change me...\n\n--Special shoutout to the popovers. I would like for them to pop over to me anytime.\n\n--Also had a very interesting spicy cocktail last night involving jalapenos. Very odd but very interesting. The Peach Cobbler inspired cocktail was also great, but a bit too sweet for me.\n\nIf you're trying to impress a food snob date/parent/sibling/friend/client/boss, have a special occasion coming up, or $50 4 course meals are your thang, by all means run to Sbraga now, and be ready to be amazed. \n\nHIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

See, what you're doing is buying the bottle at the price you'd get it at the wine shop (essentially because you *are* at a wine shop), so there's no bar/lounge mark up, then hitting up their glorious back garden space, filled with trees, fairy lights and all kinds of magic. And wait... there's more! They have a fridge with cheese wedges, and you pick one or more out, bring it up to the counter to pay and within minutes, they'll whisk a huge cheese plate to your table that's overloaded with toast, some fruit and nuts. \n\nIn the days of super lounges and other such nonsense when you're paying high covers and then $$ drinks as well, it's kind of hard to believe Bacchanal can be so generous. Maybe it's due to the city of New Orleans honoring the spirit of Bacchus on a regular basis? The god is giving back...\n\nKinda makes me want to move in... or next door or even upstairs. I won't complain about the live music, either...",

I ordered a grilled chicken salad, he ordered seared tuna on seaweed, a spicy roll, and my coworker a steak wrap with homemade chips. So we are all waiting for our food and my stomach is growling. It finally came and the presentation of my salad was bland. The seared tuna salad and roll was beautifully displayed in a pretty bowl and platter. He enjoyed the food as well, but said it was a bit spicy after he had informed the waiter not to make it hot. The steak wrap was ok. He stated the homemade chips were extremely salty. So overall it was nothing special",

  "text": "Considering we were only heading up to Reno for some golf and gambling over the July 4th weekend, stumbling into the Biggest Little City Wing Fest was a welcome surprise!  I'd been to the Rib Fest over at the Nugget about five years ago and had an awesome time, so I was both excited and hopeful that the Wing Fest would be just as good.  After all, who wouldn't be excited about the prospect of eating copious amounts of delicious wings??\n\nAlthough it's not as large as its meatier, more well known cousin, Wing Fest isn't exactly small either.  Stretching through the heart of downtown Reno (from Circus Circus to Harrah's, as well as onto some of the cross streets off N. Virginia), the festival featured nearly a dozen wing stands, along with a mix of other eateries, as well as a number of vendors selling various merchandise and crafts.  Also, like Rib Fest, it's free to enter; you just pay for what you want to eat/drink/buy.\n\nWhile there were also a couple of areas for people to take in different musical acts, we didn't really explore much beyond the different wing contestants.  Or at least, tried to.  From hot to buffalo to sweet & spicy, a wide range of styles and flavors were accounted for.  However, with long, glacially slow lines at nearly every stand, trying one or two types of wings was challenging enough, let alone all of them.  Fortunately, my buddy was able to snag some wings from a stand with a short line at a quiet edge of the festival.  Outside of that one basket we shared though, we gave up on waiting to try any others (too hungry to wait!).\n\n(For the record, the wings we had were deep fried and lathered with a sweet, fruity glaze that packed a sharp punch of heat.  Interesting flavor combination, but pretty overcooked.)\n\nNow, to be fair, the day we were there definitely wasn't a normal one, given the shooting that happened before we arrived (there was an area still cordoned off with police tape).  When we passed through the festival the night before, it was A LOT easier to maneuver around.  Granted, we were also there a little later, when they were about done for the night (most of the vendors were already closing up), but still, there were far fewer people to weave through.\n\nAlthough I'd be lying if I said the Wing Fest was even half as awesome as the Rib Fest was, I wouldn't rule out possibly coming back, as the potential is there for a better experience in the future.  Since they've only been around for a few years, perhaps they're still working out the kinks (lack of organized lines, the narrow vendor layout).  At the very least, I'd like to think (hope?) that a shooting won't happen again.  Plus, maybe an entrant will add some kick ass Korean fried chicken wings to the lineup!\n\nFor now, TWO AND A HALF STARS rounded up.",

But this was a nice large fuel center with an excellent car wash, so what the heck I will give them a boost.\n\nIssue going on in the area is construction, so be aware of this. However, don't let it stop you from pulling in as the location is on a corner with as light to pull out and avoid current construction.\n\nNo issues at the pump and it generated a paper receipt upon request which you cannot always take for granted. Pumps were clean and the trash cans not over flowing. Fuel prices were on the lower end too.\n\nThe car wash was one of the better things about Rally. They offered four different levels and since I had bugs embedded in my bumper guess what I went for. So the ultimate it was and it did not get 100% off as I thought. But the fact it got 80% off was impressive, I am talking 800 miles of bugs from Virginia to Florida.\n\nI assume this is a chain fuel joint and unsure if they are all as good.

Located along the main street in downtown Carmel Arts & Design District, The Pint Room boasts plentiful indoor/outdoor/bar/hightop/you name it seating. We kicked things off by enjoying $2-$4 small pours from their enormous tap list. Our group was able to enjoy pineapple cider, chile cocoa stout, IPAs, bourbon barrel, and so on. For those of us who 1.) love to sample a little of this and a little of that; 2.) are not hard core beer drinkers - the small pours are PERFECT! I could sit there for hours working my way down the menu. Rumor has it they're great at rotating the offerings so regulars can always find something new. Customer service during our visit was a-okay during our visit and I was happy to see a diverse audience of patrons. \n\nBeyond the drinks, I ordered a side of the chili topped with onion, cheese and sour cream along with a small side salad. It was nice to have some light-ish options to pair with the beers at affordable prices. If you find yourself along the Monon or strolling through the Arts & Design District, pop in The Pint Room.",

  "text": "I'm not a vegan but as a food lover, I found my place at Charlie was a Sinner. I think the only sin about my experience was that I didn't sample more of the small plates! \n\nHearing rave reviews, my friend and I decided to check out Charlie was a Sinner for dinner. Based on reviews I read, it looked like the happy hour menu was served at the tables. Please be advised that it's only available at the bar and lounge areas. I was a little disappointed to not be able to receive happy hour pricing on the food; however the items on special weren't to-try list anyways, so it worked out for the best. \n\nThe first few minutes of my visit were spent at the bar waiting for my friend to arrive, so I was able to enjoy the Troublemaker beverage as part of happy hour. The Troublemaker was made up of titos, dolin sweet, cucumber, strawberry and club soda. It was mixed very well and I couldn't taste any of the alcohol. It was refreshing almost in a health juice type of way. It was enjoyable but to be honest, I would not have wanted to pay full price for another one. I made the switch to the Stoudts, Fourplay IPA. As an IPA girlie, I was delighted that it was on draft and for only $5. \n\nSo my friend and I decided to order a few small plates. Still a bit hungry we ordered an additional small plate and finally a dessert. Each one was enjoyable in a different way and I'll talk about them in order of favorite to least favorite:\n\n\n*Spiced Cauliflower: Would have it been wrong to just order 5 plates of this? Omg, wow. It was packed with flavor and good to the last bite. This might be my first lovefest over a faux meat but the royal trumpet steak was out of this world. It was flavorable and had a great texture/consistency. \n\n*Fava Beans & Gnocci: The dish was made up of pine nuts and had a very pesto like flavor as a result. The gnocchi was light and fluffy. Very, very enjoyable. \n\n*Charlie's Chocolate Cake: It reminded me of a flourless cake and was packed with chocolate in every bite. The raspberry sorbet was light, refreshing and had pieces of actual fruit. \n\n*Bucatini & Meatballs: While I loved the meatball, there were only three on the dish. I absolutely loved the one and a half I tried but I would have liked to see more or a large meatball dish. They were a bit spicy, very well textured and overall had a great flavor. The bucatini was just a little bland and I didn't think it was anything special.\n\n*Tofu & Bean Sausage: If you blind folded me and told me I was eating sausage, I would have believed you. It was good from the standpoint that it tasted like meat however simply put, it just tasted like a standard sausage. The parsnip mash was fine but a little too mashed for me, and the pesto was faint.  \n\n*Broccoli Rabe: This was the first dish we picked but sadly my least favorite. The broccoli was tough and a challenge to separate and cut. It was prepared with garlic and chili but it wasn't super flavorable to me. I'd pass on this one in the future.\n\n\nAll and all, to have absolutely loved three of the dishes (and one component of another) is a win in my book. \n\nYou can add service and atmosphere as a reason to visit. The dining room was trendy and dark, depending on the brightness level of the projection screen. The service was attentive and professional. Our dishes were served as they became available which paced out our experience nicely. \n\nI'm not adopting a vegan lifestyle anytime soon, but I can certainly count on Charlie Was a Sinner for an overall good restaurant experience.",

  "text": "I was struggling with what was going to be review #1500. Would I go try a new place? Would I seek out something unique and fun to celebrate? I contemplated it. But I decided I'd rather review Wat Mongkolratanaram, a Buddhist temple in Tampa that offers a lovely Thai market on Sunday mornings. It's not something you come across too often.\n\nI had been looking for cool things to do in Tampa, which are hard to come by, as I left the city somewhat indifferent about it. Luckily, before I left, I had found out about this place on the Tampa talk threads. From what I can tell, you need a car to get here.\n\nI agree with much of what has been said: come here early (parking is rough and food runs out), bring plenty of cash, and plan to grab some small items to eat while you stand in line for the noodle soup. I missed out on the noodle soup because of poor planning. Do not let this happen to you. Also, come with people that like to eat and understand waiting in line for food.\n\nFood wise, we tried various spring rolls and dumplings, beef satay, pumpkin curry, and chicken basil. Everything was great, and I'm fairly obsessed with the spring rolls. I also tried the papaya salad, and that was the only thing I did not really care for, and normally, I love it.\n\nThe grounds are idyllic, and the temple is gorgeous. There's really no other way to describe it. Ideally, when I return, I'll return alone, and be able to stay for services, which all are welcome to join. \n\nAs a visitor to the area, I definitely recommend finding a way to get here. It was a highlight of my trip.",

It is delicious and worth every single calorie when dipped in their homemade butter. I want to come back and try more, maybe next time I'm in Indy.",

  "text": "I was traveling through the area for business and had some time before my appointment and decided to grab some breakfast and thought this little café looked interesting. It's seems to be a local's favorite judging from the interaction between the staff and the few tables that had customers seated. The atmosphere is laid back and the restaurant was very clean and organized, I was greeted and told I could sit anywhere I liked. The staff here is very friendly and the service attentive, I was given a menu after taking a seat and my server returned immediately ready to take my drink and breakfast order.\n\nMy breakfast arrived after only a few minutes and looking at my plate it appeared to be just okay, the ham looked a little disappointing and after taking a few bites I decided to focus on the rest of the meal. I don't feel there is anything terrible here except I really didn't care for the ham, the rest of the food was just average at best. I don't know if I would go out of my way to stop in again but with the options in the immediate area pretty limited I might give them another opportunity if I'm in the area.",

Although I don't have a concrete favorite pizza place in South Jersey, they are definitely within the top 3. I would definitely recommend getting the sausage pie! Their sandwiches are also very good and their fries are always blazing hot! Oh and how can I forget their wings? I'm always a little skeptical getting wings from a pizza place, but the King's wings share the throne! We don't go to King as much as we used to, but we do order take-out every now and then. For some reason, it always tastes MUCH better when you eat it there. KIng of Pizza truly does live up to its name.",

  "text": "I was never a fan of the Cheesecake Factory so I was a bit hesitant to try this place, but I'm so glad I did! I've been here numerous times and the service has always been wonderful! Everyone I've encountered have friendly and welcoming faces that make it coming here an enjoyable experience. The kitchen can be seen through some select seats and the cooks taste test each entree before they deliver it, which I've never seen any other restaurant do before. That just shows how much they care about their customers and how they strive for perfection. One time, I ordered a side of marinara sauce and not only did our waitress notify us that it was on being warmed up, but a few minutes later another cook from the back came to tell us that he's warming it up and it will be out shortly. So kind! \n\nTheir food is also delicious. I'm a vegetarian so I typically have limited options at restaurants, but they have a good variety. Their pasta was one of the best pastas I've ever had. The pizza is a must because their bread is just so fresh and tasty! Same goes for the hummus, very filling for an appetizer! They also have an array from desserts to choose from, some of which they make especially for you! If you're thinking about getting dessert, check out the desserts page when you're ordering because some of them need up to 45 minutes to make. Overall, everything I had was very fresh and appetizing. Every time I'm in Cherry Hill I have to stop by here, even came here with my family for graduation dinner and they loved it as well!",

  "text": "I've been to Mojito Cuba Caribe twice, both times under different ownership. The first time was under a funny dude name Mickey. He was great and had wonderful stories to tell. The food then is a different story. Portions were a tad bit small for the prices they charged. I came back last week with family and under the new owners, the food has improved drastically in my opinion.\n\nWe started off with some mango mojitos and beers. They have a few select IPA's on special and their mango mojitos were amazing. We ordered a sizzling grilled chicken fajita and Pan de Lechon which consist of roast pork, mojo cilantro mayonnaise and grilled onions on pressed Cuban bread. The roast pork sandwich was very juicy and tender. The cilantro mayonnaise along with the onions went really well on that toasty Cuban bread. As for the fajitas, they sure came out sizzling. Many other patrons ordered it because it smelled so good whenever the waiter passed by with it. It was really worth it. Served with grilled onions, bell peppers, rice and beans, guacamole, sour cream and warm tortillas. It was very filling and one of these best things to eat in all of Main Street in New Hope.\n\nVerdict - Mojito Cuba Caribe is a nice cozy fancy little joint. There's outdoor seating and the service here does not disappoint. I miss the Mick but the food under the current owners is way better than before. Everything is speedier and tastier. Job well done!",

This left the following options: Either go back outside and grab a cart, or cling on to your items and hope they don't drop. Because that would be costly and unfortunate.\n\nBeyond the cart/basket situation, Maro Brothers' (AKA: the old Joe Canals) manages to have fairly terrible selection. You'll walk in to florescent lights and wines hanging out in carts rather than on shelves. I didn't bother to browse the wine.\n\nI headed over to the beer section, and they were severely lacking in the craft department. But hey, if you're looking for a case of Rolling Rock, this is your place!\n\nJust make sure you have ID on you and ready to present for analysis. I've never seen one store display SO many signs about the fact that you're going to get carded. Like, cool, congrats, you're following the law? But how about investing in something other than signs?\n\nLike.. say, baskets?",

Yeah I know, its a chain and favoring it is shuddersome, but I think its the best value for the money.  Smash Burger has generous portions, a nice large dining room, and a very friendly staff.  In fact I was finishing a long run one day and stopped in somewhat sweaty.  The chatty cashier was so welcoming she even gave me a bottled water!  My one mistake was ordering the double smash, it was huge so I took half of it home.

That obviously doesn't affect the rating of TKO, but honestly, I was not hugely impressed by Lance, the DJ who replaced our original guy.  He was very nice and kind enough to let my neurotic self give him a detailed list of what we wanted played--accompanied by a CD of songs we didn't think they'd have... and I know we checked the \"NOT over-the-top DJ\" box when selecting what type of DJ we were interested in, but a *little* personality wouldn't have killed the guy.  \n\nSo the wedding reception had good music, but I didn't think the sound quality was that great--this could have been an acoustics problem with our venue and not the blame of TKO, but Lance could've turned up the volume a bit.

The fish was so soft it almost melts in your mouth. The avocado creme was smooth and went well with the fish. \n\nGoat curry/sweet potato gnocchi/cashews- Wow. This dish had a lot of stuff going on. We asked for the spice level to be kicked up a bit and it was so good! The goat was so tender it was falling apart. The cashews added a nice crunch. I liked the contrast in texture.\n\nBanana rum zeppole?- not sure about the name but M really loved this. The caramel sauce was amazing and the balls were stuffed with chocolate. \n\nCoconut Tres Leches- Yum! I loved the smooth layers of cake and the homemade whipped cream. \n\nEverything was amazing from the food to the drinks. Our server, Mario, was also very good. He had great recommendations. \n\nThe only hiccup was when I ordered a mocktail and was served a regular cocktail. I took a sip and told M, \"Wow! It's really good it tastes like a regular cocktail\" and a few seconds later Mario came running to the table to take it away. Apparently the person who dropped it off was new.. Not really a good enough excuse for me for such a big mistake but what's done is done.\n\nOverall a great dining experience. Will definitely be back.",

Hated myself for being an uncoordinated mess, but whatevs.\n\nI don't know that the new studio itself is that much more spacious (although the area to hang out in pre-class is, and there is now a small locker room) Then again the huge crowd that turned out for the free class probably did not help...\n\nHIP HOP CLASSES\nI've been to Sammy's beginner (intro $5 class-print the coupon off their site!) and intermediate (lol I know, but it was free) hip hop and he is amazing. He is a hilarious, fierce, fast dancing, fast talking, AWESOME teacher, and he will make you wish you were as cool as him and make you want to be a hip hop dancer. His classes are basically some warm ups, then he teaches you a routine, and then halves of the room alternate doing the routine. Everyone is very supportive and claps and doesn't give you death stares even if you suck and can't get the steps and are always in everyone's way because you are 5 beats behind.\n\nCAVEATS: \n1. If you are not a dancer and just want a workout class, like me, this will be challenging, but you'll get a workout for sure.\n2. The prices. They are high. $20 is steep if you are not a dancer.\n\nRecommend for dancers, and to everyone who has $5 and could use a laugh/sweat/pick-me-up!",

  "text": "An adorable little village located on the third floor of Macy's Center City in the old Wanamaker Building as many of you know. It's a permanent fixture here in Philly and is also a family tradition for many. A visit here is FREE and works perfectly when combined with Macy's iconic light show viewing. Make sure to leave appropriate time for both and of course for some impromptu shopping! \n\nYou'll first walk through a room of gorgeous holiday decor, giant nutcrackers and some nutcrackers and ornaments for purchase. We actually added one from here this year to our every growing, beloved collection! \n\nThe village is modeled after London in the 1900's and done so well! The journey begins with Charles Dickens reciting the first passage from his iconic \"A Christmas Carol\". You then walk through Christmas Past, Future and Present, but of course. The details are super sweet and get you feeling nostalgic and certainly leaving in the holiday spirit. \n\nAt the end of the village you will have the option to visit Santa or just walk through. Staff is on hand to take professional photos free with an option to purchase or you may take your own. They cannot however, take photos with your camera or phone so come prepared. \n\nAt the exit you will enter an area for Build A Bear Workshop complete with fashionable and seasonal outfits. This year there was even the oh so popular Troll accessories available. \n\nThe staff, clad in appropriate period garb were all so kind. They kept the line moving and chatted with all of the kiddos, even handing them all a Santa keepsake pin with the year on it. \n\nI say it's an absolute must! Really wee ones may get scared of Jacob Marley shaking at his grave or at the ghost of Christmas Past hanging above. They may also throw a fit for you to purchase something. Come with these things in mind and you'll be fine. Stroller space is also a tad limited. Consider leaving it at the exit as you would for an amusement ride. \n\nMy husband and I both really loved it! The kiddos of course, loved Santa! And hey, it's FREE! Why not?!",

  "text": "It was cold, wet, and a windy night in Chinatown Philadelphia. We were all hungry after visiting the Christmas Village for the holidays and with several restaurants across from us, we decided to choose this place for their decent reviews.\n\nI ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and beef scallion pancake for appetizer. I am fortunate enough to be living in Las Vegas for nine years where Asian soup from different parts of the world is not hard to find. I would have to say that the beef soup here was less than satisfaction. I prefer my meat cut smaller rather than large chunks, but the meat was very tender. The broth overall was good, but I prefer the Taiwanese  beef noodle soup at Noodle Pot in Vegas.\n\nAs for the beef scallion pancakes that seems to be very popular here, is not so popular with me. The sauce was too sweet for me and the pancake was a little bit chewy. The temperature was almost at room temperature that may had contributed for being a little bit chewy. Liang's Kitchen in Vegas has awesome beef scallion pancakes served warm and is seasoned well.\n\nThe ladies were great and service was super quick. However, when in Chinatown, I would try other places before coming back here again.",

There seems to be two main dining areas.  We had an early dinner reservation and were seated near the window which was great.  \n\nThey make ordering easy by having the number next to the meal (which is more for a Chinese restaurant not a nicer restaurant like this).\n\nThey have a few outside tables for fresh air seating.  Inside is very cozy and comfortable. \nIt's a BYOB so don't forget your bottle of wine.\n\nThe waiter was really nice.\n\nAppetizers\nWe started our meal with tasty bruchetta and fresh bread.\nOrdered the Mozzarella Caprese which is explained as mozzarella and tomatoes but I was disappointed in this dish.  2/3 of the plate was filled with olives, roasted peppers and onions (see pic).  The 1/3 contained thinly sliced tomatoes and very VERY small pieces of mozzarella.  Don't bother with this dish.\nCuz - Had the Caesar salad which he enjoyed as he ate every single bite.\nI had the Port Wine Mushroom Soup (daily chef special) which looked weird but was really good.   Looked like puree mushrooms.  I'm glad I ordered it as it was super tasty.\n\nDinner-\nHubby - had the veal parmigiana which he said was good.\nI had the Petto Di Pollo Alla Melazane which was chicken breast with a slice of eggplant on top.  This was a really good meal and I would definitely order it again.\nLuckily they offered a kids meal so my kid had chicken tenders and potato chips.\n\nNo desserts this time.\n\nYes I'll be back but I'll stay away from the appetizers.",

It was recommended to us by some locals as we wanted to get a little bit off the beaten path and boy was it some kind of recommendation. We actually went for po boys but looking at other reviews it looks like there are many memorable dishes at this establishment.\n\nWe were seated at the bar, greeted immediately by the bartender, had a drink and got a grilled and fried catfish po boy. I'm not expert but I've had my fair share over the years and this is by far the best one I've come across. It's the one dish I'd like to have one more time! In fact, that was the plan but I overlooked the closing time of 3PM on Sunday so I guess I'll just have to come back to NoLa to get my fix! Absolutely delicious!",

A franchise based out of Maryland, they focus on flat crust, Sicillian-style, which makes my week of pizza eating unique in that on Sunday I had Cappys Chicago-style deep dish, and now this.\n\nThere were 5 of us eating after a long day of outdoor activity and we got a large pepperoni and pre-cooked bacon (\"bacon\" is on the menu, but is actually Canadian Bacon). They cut it in half and serve each half on a large rectangular tray. This makes consumption is groups easy. The pepperoni is thick cut, so one per square is perfect.\n\nFortunately we were pretty exhausted so the large filled us up, but had we been more ravenous, we probably would have gotten something else. Thin crust is tasty, but not really filling.",

Just remember not to loiter *too* long if you've already finished your drink and people could sure use a seat.\n\nIn my case, I got my oat milk black-and-tan (half oat milk draft latte, half cold brew) very quickly, and it was darn delicious.

(Feel free to scroll through my past reviews to laugh at my expense for that).\n\nThe pros:.\n\n1:  The hotel is conveniently located near the airport and offers free shuttle service.  The shuttle runs every 15 minutes and when I used it this morning, it arrived on time and was quite helpful.\n2. The front desk staff is AMAZINGLY helpful.  I am staying at this airport (in an out) for a few days in conjunction with a move overseas and had several questions upon my initial arrival.  The staff went ABOVE and BEYOND to help me get my answers and made multiple stressful situations for me go smoothly.\n3. There is a restaurant on site that has a variety of price point meals.  Its good if you don't feel like venturing out.  The food is pretty good quality.\n4. The gym and pool were also top notch.\n5. My room was CLEAN (thank you travel gods) and spacious and well stocked.  The bed was also very comfortable.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n1. There is some nickel and diming with the having to pay for wifi...come on now its 2013?\n2. Walls are pretty thin and at some times it seemed like I could hear anything and everything yet I never heard a plane.\n3. Paying for parking...meh.....just another annoyance but not the end of the world.\n\n\nIn the end, I'd definitely go back to this hotel should I find myself back in the area without hesitation.",

The guac was extremely creamy, but definitely didn't taste the freshest and it was that dark green hue that comes from maybe some of the avocados a little past their prime. It was also topped with like a parmesan style cheese which didn't help. \n\nThe sonoran hot dog? A few bites, but it was more bread than dog. Womp womp.\nThe margarita?

Located in the heart of the arts district off Mass Ave, enter through the door by the Stamp Shop on the corner to get here!\n\n\nWhat makes it fun:\nTwana -- AKA \"the Hostess with the mostest\" was awesome!  So friendly!   Our glasses were never empty nor did we have to ask for anything.  She was hilarious, personable, and anticipated our needs.  Sweet.  \n\nAlan -- our instructor for the evening.  Provided great guidance while encouraging individual creativity.  He was very willing to hop in and help where needed and was funny to boot.  He even did a great job of diffusing the awkwardness of some \"difficult\" painters and made us laugh in the process.\n\n$5 \"liquid courage\" -- Red and white wines, mimosas... very generous pours and quality product for just $5 a glass.\n\n\nWhat sets them apart:\nThey let you customize your color palate so your painting can complement your decor -- which was really nice.  Other similar places already have your stuff set up and colors are predetermined when you arrive.  Not at Mimosa & a Masterpiece.  They will even give you a quick overview of which colors look good together to ensure you are on the right track.\n\nYou are encouraged to \"make it your own\" -- meaning they will provide a loose guide and framework, but not a step-by-step on how to make your painting look EXACTLY like theirs.  This is great for the creative or rebel painter...and it's all in fun anyway, right?  \n\nSo yes.  We will return to Mimosa & a Masterpiece again.  SO. MUCH. FUN.",

  "text": "Cool, modern brewery located in Ardmore. The space is quite large and they have the beer stills displayed in the rear of the room. There are tables to sit at which utilize waitress service, or you can sit in the bar area at one of the high top tables. The bar area fills up quickly and it's first come, first serve. By around 6pm all seats are full. You may even have to wait to get a table in the dining room. This place is very popular! As for the beer here, the house Saizon was very tasty. They have a wide selection of different types of beer that will satisfy all palates. As the food goes, the menu is pretty limited. Focusing on sandwiches and tacos. My Chicken Taco's were just ok, I found them to be a little bland. But I have to say, the hand cut french fries were finger licking good. They were great to munch on while we sampled our brews. The service was excellent, our server was super attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. I can't wait to return for another round of beers.",

They feature different food vendors and simply give them a call ahead of time to see whose there.\n\nA/C? They just got it installed this summer. Screw you humidity!\n\nBeer? Well yea... it's a brewery!\n\nDrink options for non-beer drinkers? They have fresh lemonade on tap, kombucha, ginger something something, and water on tap!\n\nCome hang out and bring the squad because there is plenty of seating space.",

They seem to mainly carry higher end items in the retail store but some things can be ordered in a cheaper configuration.  They want you to sign in when you first walk in the retail store and the wait for a salesperson can be a much longer time than you would expect so they use the sign in list to determine who gets the next available salesperson.  The plumbing supply business can get really busy especially in the morning as they carry one of the largest selections of plumbing supplies in the area.  I have been given some incorrect parts before but they have always been easy to work with to exchange them.",

  "text": "The Newtown area has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to fresh, homemade ice cream.  At last count, there are at least four shops making their own cold creamies, and each has something special going for it. With February weather reaching 80 last week, climate change now makes ice cream an all year delight. \n\nUncle Dave's is located in the main store on Shady Brook Farm off Stony Brook Road and the Newtown Bypass. They offer an interesting selection of their ice cream with the ability to accessorize with sprinkles, fudge, caramel, etc. Prices are about right for the competition. Under $4 for the \"Kids\" size; $5 for the \"Medium,\" and $7 for the \"Large.\" In my experience, that Kids size with three scoops of up to three of your favorite flavors was enough. Don't let the description of \"Kids\" deter you from getting only what you can lick in one serving. \n\nI went with two scoops of butter pecan and one scoop of the seasonal pumpkin. They were both creamy and tasted as they should. Not too sweet, not under-flavored. Both were pretty much what I expected. My friends and their young kids opted for more varieties, including cappuccino, strawberry and peanut butter with a side of peanut butter sauce.  They were all happy with their choices. \n\nWas it the best ice cream in greater Newtown? That's a matter of personal preference.  But, given all the alternatives, it represented Dave's well.  Their offerings were more standard that some other parlors, so if exotic and romantic taste is your thing, you might find this place a little uninspired.  For you folks, OhWowCow in Wrightstown is the only way to go. Of course, it also costs more for premium. \n\nLick on!",

This was evident by the amount of people trying to use credit cards, who obviously didn't know that Aldi is DEBIT ONLY.  There were actually so many folks there for opening that they had no carts available because they were all in use.  So to compensate,  they were giving away free Aldi bags. They were also handing out $5 off coupons. So yeah it was a little crazy.\n\nThe store was fully stocked, as you can imagine.  The one thing I couldn't find though was the fit n active section where all of the healthier options are. Perhaps it was just too busy. I'll snoop around next time since the joint is only a few miles down the road. Much closer than the less-than-stellar Town & Country locale.\n\nThis Aldi is pretty large as well.  It seems very close in size to the one on US 19.\n\nIf they have the chicken sausage links, pick them up! They're seasonal, delicious and versatile. Use them in gumbo, pasta dishes or just on a bun. I've had the chicken sausages from Publix and Trader Joe's, but Aldi reigns supreme. No joke. I stockpile them. La Chica makes fun of it and calls it my \"sausage collection,\" but trust me, she ain't laughing when I cook dinner. \n\nLastly, try the 16\" take and bake pizzas; they're damn near pizzeria quality.\n\nOh, and to the grocery store snobs, Trader Joe's parent company is Aldi :)",

Anyhow, last night at Chifa, my friends and I gorged on some crazy awesome dishes, and I proudly ate outside of my comfort zone. We sat in the back room where I felt like an extra on the set of Eyes Wide Shut...you know, in the scene with all the naked women and creepy monk-men with masks? Chifa totally has that vibe. The booth was cozy and I got to lounge on the pillow that cushioned my lower back. Nice touch.\n\nThe food: Everything was brought out in smallish bowls, but there was so much food, we were totally pleased with the portions. We had the lomo (beef and veggies), caldo (seafood bisque type soup), bbq ribs (there were no bones!) and chicken wings (no bones either!). There wasn't an unsatisfactory thing about our dishes. You'll also have to ask for more bread. It's unreal.\n\nAs for the cocktail, I got the Black Tea Sidecar. I'm a big fan of Courvoisier cognac (random, I know), but trust me, you can drink a gallon and you won't have a hangover in the morning. Promise. Anyway, I had to ask for an extra bit of simple syrup because the cocktail felt a little lacking in the sweet dept. I also think it could have used more lemon...I'm not sure if lemon was used at all.\n\nOverall, outstanding time and great food.",

  "text": "Part of the Brennan's Restaurant group and in business for over 40 years, Mr. B's Bistro is one of the best and most popular eateries in New Orleans. It's located on Royal Street and very near the Hotel Monteleone and usually open 7 days a week for lunch and dinner but during Covid is closed Monday and Tuesday. Mr.B's is an upscale table service establishment with a full bar but doesn't require a coat for gentlemen. \n\nI had dinner here a couple of weeks ago for the first time in many years. It was a Saturday night and the restaurant was full so reservations are important especially on weekend nights. I ordered the Bistro Salad for $9.50 and the Wood Grilled Fish for $31 and added the jumbo lump crabmeat for another $12. Within 5 minutes a loaf of warm french bread with butter and the salad came out. The salad had baby greens, pecans, grape tomatoes, Padano cheese with an herb vinaigrette. I loved that salad. It was so fresh and delicious and was a perfect mixture of ingredients. The bread loaf came in a bag to keep it warm and was soft and fresh.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later the entree arrived and it was one of the best grilled fish dinners that I have had in a long time. First of all, the wood flavor in the fillet was so pleasing. It was perfect in taste and a large piece to boot. The fish was over a mound of pecan popcorn rice that was delicious too. It was a perfect side to the fish and with the grilled green beans made me very happy. The jumbo lump crabmeat on top of the fish was also a delight. I mean how can you not like crab meat like that? Honestly, this meal would have still been excellent without the crabmeat and if I ordered this again, I might skip the crabmeat and save the $12 for dessert. I was stuffed after this meal so I skipped dessert. Table service during the meal was very good.\n\nIt's restaurants like Mr. B's Bistro that make New Orleans the great foodie town it is. If you come here to eat, you made a good choice. My experience a couple of weeks ago was a 5.",

The rest of the menu is your casual fare and there honestly isn't much worth talking about once you pass the blooming onions. If you want a real steak I would recommend heading to some great venues in South Tampa instead, such as SideBern's.

  "text": "EVERY time I come here to refill a growler, I feel like I'm stepping into Cheers or some other friendly place where everyone knows your name. (Except they don't know my name here. But, like, they treat me as though I'm a friend.) My sole experience of Upland consists of refilling growlers, but one day I hope to visit and sit in their dining room or on their patio and eat their food.\n\nI highly recommend their Champagne beer -- it is pretty awesome and pretty much the only kind I get. When I find something I love, I stick with it!\n\nOne great thing about this place is that they give you a free 12 ounce glass of beer with every growler refill. It's nice to just sit, chill and take your time sipping free beer while a person readies a giant jug of beer for you to take home. It warms the cockles of my heart just thinking about it.",

  "text": "So, first the first time in a long time (long time), I had time. Read that again so that it makes sense. What does one do after finding time after such a long time of not having time? Good question. I began to remember the things that I enjoyed doing (before I lost the time to do them) and set about trying to do them again. I slept in. I hit the gym. I cooked. And, I decided to read. Books. I was going to read books.\n\nAs much as it pains my librarian friend, I don't have an active library card and despite the community and environmental benefits of libraries, if I think too much about them, they sort of gross me out. But (to make him happy), I am not much of an e-reader. There's something about the tactile quality of books that adds so much to the reading experience. Perhaps it's a function of age and habit but I have never felt quite comfortable curling up with a tablet. Give me a book every time. \n\nTactile intentions made, I just had to decide where to shop. That wasn't a very hard choice. In Nashville, if you're buying a book, you come to Parnassus. I'd written about Parnassus. I'd given directions to Parnassus. I'd never been or patronized the store. Ergo, I made some mistakes. 1.) I showed up looking for a non-local book. Don't do this. Go online. Search for the book. See if it's in stock. See if there's a signing at the store. Proceed accordingly. I arrived to a packed house. There was a lecture/book signing and all hands were on deck. I looked around, made eye contact with an employee and asked if there was a kiosk for searching. She smiled and whispered she was the kiosk and asked for my title. I gave it to her and... not in stock. But, she could order it for me and have it in store in two days. Cool. I gave her my info, tiptoed out and braved the Green Hills traffic back to my home.\n\nAfter some early morning appointments, I made my way back to Green Hills and... closed. This leads me to point 2.) Verify hours. Just because other stores open at certain times does not mean this store does. Independent store. Independent hours. Again, I left Green Hills harrowed and sans book. The third time was the charm: I arrived, asked for my book and a book I received. Both of the employees with whom I chatted were pleasant and knowledgeable. Not only did they know my book and author, they gave me information about upcoming lectures/signings of said author (and similar authors). It was at this moment that it hit me that this was a bookstore owned, operated and (wo)manned by people who love books. The comfortable, bright design showcases said love and makes one want to spend more time loving on all the ink, spines, paper, and words that change opinions, open hearts, transform worlds, and comfort souls.\n\nI'm happy to have some time back.* I have a whole list of books to buy/read and I look forward to doing so with the help of Parnassus. I'll just abide by the rules going forward.\n\n*Reclaimed.",

You can unlock it by opening the blue door and by checking the store out. It's a big (it takes up 3 floors) store, full of cool vintage, antique items, one of a kind. The place is clean, well organized, not the dusty, cluttered type. They do have cool paintings, furniture, lamps, so if you're looking for unique, interesting things for your house, this place is worth checking. Nothing is cheap here, but the condition of the items they sell is good and a lot of items are more unique. I enjoyed passing behind the Blue Door and discovering what's inside.",

  "text": "Cool local business that specializes in handmade glass pieces.  The studio is incorporated into a house - so you enter through the garage doors, walk past the work area, and then there are separate sections in the backyard with merchandise for sale.  Parking is on the street in front of the house.\n\nOnce you pass through the garage, there is an enclosed small 'gallery' where unique and interesting one-of-a-kind pieces are for sale.  Then, next to that are two outdoor areas that have items for sale like ornaments, vases, glass flowers, and their specialty items - spirit weights and cast glass paper weights.  I went during the holidays and picked up some unique ornaments, a vase, and glass \"kisses\".  There is even an oops shelf which had some pretty interesting mistakes at discounted prices.\n\nI will definitely stop here again.

The bacon was crispy, there was a good amount of turkey, the wheat bread was soft and the avocado was plentifulllll. You can snag fries, chips or a salad as your side. \n\nThe flatbreads are delicious and there are about eight different options. The BBQ chicken flatbread has avocado and sounded amazing, as did the margarita and mushroom flatbreads.\n\nService has always been kind and efficient, no frills. Find this spot in Terminal B!",

  "text": "Thank you fellow Yelpers in helping us find a good ramen shop in Philly!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nContemporary Asian decor. Clean and newer looking shop. Counter & table seating. \n\nFOOD:\nGyoza \n5 pieces of pork & veggie dumplings fried to perfection, with a delicious dipping sauce. \n\nMini Tokyo Fried Chicken Curry  \nWhat a great deal at only $2!  Small bowl of rice topped with the crispy chicken & curry gravy.  Delish!  I wasn't a curry fan but my taste buds are a-changin'!\n\nMayu Ramen \nWhen I ordered this, both the chef & server acted surprised and asked me if I've ever had ramen before, and told me what the broth was made of and that its the same broth that's in the Terakawa signature ramen but a step above it. Come on now, what Asian do you know who hasn't eaten ramen?  I know they meant well.  I just said yes and that I was sure that's what I wanted.  Ok, the broth is made from a pork bone base so the color is a milky brown but they also add in mayu which they tout as a dark roasted leek & crushed garlic oil mixture, which adds a layer of black oil seasoning that floats at the top.  The broth is mild in flavor and is very rich and filling.  Some reviewers mistake it as bland but I don't think it's meant to be an overpowering flavor.  The toppings of char siu, red ginger, mushrooms, scallions, and egg all compliment the broth nicely.  I've never had anything like this so I'm glad I tried it. It's definitely not for the average ramen eater - you've got to be a fan. \n\nTan Tan Ramen \nMy spouse added a hard boiled egg to his dish. I tasted the broth only.  It's a bit sweet for a tan tan base and not spicy.  Our favorite version resides at at Goma Tei in Honolulu which is spicier and more savory. \n\nSERVICE:\nWalked in at 3pm on a Monday afternoon and got seated immediately as the place was empty.  Our female server was very friendly but disappeared after our order was taken.  Someone else brought over our food. She didn't check on us or refill our waters.  The chef was very engaging and cared about what his customers were eating as he consulted with us while ordering. \n\nOVERALL:\nNice & clean ramen shop in Philly's Chinatown with great food and average prices. Definitely a come back spot!",

Everything was served in either to-go containers or styrofoam plates. Our group of five ordered different items so I was able to see a variety of dishes. I ordered the chicken bowl which was served with pinto beans, rice, shredded lettuce, sour cream and some sort of pseudo guacamole. I skipped the pico de gallo. I enjoyed my bowl for the most part. The Chicken had a nice char and it was cooked well. I found the beans and rice to be salty- but I have a low tolerance for salt\nOthers ordered bowls as well- carne asada and barbacoa. There was also an order of shrimp tacos- one grilled one battered. They looked good but I can't report on them as I didn't try them myself- I did post a photo for reference!\n\nWhat you should know:\nI didn't see too much on the menu that aligned with \"Baja Fish\"-standard items on menu- chicken, carne asada, barbcoa, plus fish tacos and shrimp cocktail. \nIt's order at the counter\nYou can eat fast\nYou can order takeout easily.",

Yes, definitely my friends, too.  \n\nWhen I was in Philly, my friend, Joyce, took me to Sabrina's.  We got there at around 10 AM and were seated immediately.  The place was absolutely packed on a Sunday morning and after finishing my meal, I knew exactly why.  \n\nThey had a really punny, dating-themed portion of the menu, but I opted for their classic stuffed challah french toast (11.29) and a large orange juice (3.99).  \n\nThe challah toast is delightfully thick and chewy, and the cream cheese whipped stuffing in between is not too heavy.  I'm not sure what they mix it with, but it has just a hint of the sour cream cheese flavor without giving off the sense that you're eating a block of the stuff.  The bananas and berries sprinkled generously all over provide some tartness and fiber, haha, in between bites of carb-y, sugary- goodness.  One thing I will note is that they pour syrup over everything and it pools at the bottom of the plate.  If you're not into soggy parts of toast by the end of your meal, try asking for the syrup on the side.  \n\nOooh, child.  That was the absolute best french toast I have EVER had.  So good, in fact, that the very next morning, my friend, Jacque C., and I went to the Sabrina's Cafe on 910 Christian Street and ordered the very same thing.  If you're looking for a great breakfast spot, look no further than Sabrina's!",

  "text": "Folks, there's a reason we trust Yelp. \n\nWe ended up here for sheer curiosity. And because I really wanted pasta/pizza/cheese/more cheese and if you're going to eat pasta, pizza, and lots of cheese you also need some wine. And if you're going to have some wine you might as well be somewhere swanky. You know so that the world shines extra bright once you've had too much of it (wine). \n\nThe food is delicious. Completely faultless. The menu is interesting the dishes are unique. I got to try rabbit for the first time and it was super tasty! It was a big hefty portion with a tangy creamy wine sauce and I frankly could have eaten the whole thing. Thankfully I was sharing it, so I couldn't. \n\nThe wine list was underwhelming, however the prices were pretty reasonable (as far as markups go). \n\nThe reason this tasty dinner only gets 3 stars from me is just as you will read in every other review...the service is BRUTAL. Not rude, not mean, just really unpolished. I'm fairly certain the only criteria to being hired here is being attractive and young. Our server was totally personable, and totally good looking and that's where it stopped. They put a carafe of water on your table but never once topped the waters off for us. They \"auction\" food. They look stressed. I mean it's not bad they're not bad people. They just aren't experienced servers. There's a reason being a professional server is a distinguished career! It takes practice, skill, and passion. \n\nThis restaurant is 5 stars but it's operating at 3 stars because they're not putting the time or effort into service. It's kind of a shame.",

  "text": "In the way of word association, when host/owner DK Kelly asked \"How was everything?\" as our party of four departed, the single word that popped to my tongue was \"Extraordinary!\".  Wiith that exclamatory emphasis.  Each element of this little jewel of a French bistro created by husband DK, who manages front of house, and wife Sara, who is the Chef running the kitchen, adds up to perfect.  Being fans of the Kelly's earlier Boise venture, remarkable sandwich eatery 'bleubird', we arrived at Petite 4 with lofty expectations.  Expectations were exceeded on every level for charming hospitality, artful ambiance, splendid service and wonderful food.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:  The English noun restaurant is derived from the French verb restaurer - to restore.  As in to restore the spirit.  And so it does to dine at Petite 4.  It is joy filled.  Go!\n\n A TIP:  reservations are essential if you want table seating and they take calls for reservations only between 3-5pm on Tu-Sat.  \n\nHOSPITALITY:   DK makes gracious hospitality seem effortless.  It is a gift.  The charm of \"all are welcome\" starts from the time reservations are made and continues through being greeted at the door as if you are the special ones they have been waiting for as you are escorted to your table.  Lovely to be made to feel welcome like that.\n\nFOOD: Ooh-la-la!  Each bistro-inspired dish is a feast for the taste buds and delightfully plated in feast for the eyes.  Portions are ample.  Something we learned on our first visit when four of us shared two starters and each ordered a seafood dish individually followed by two shared desserts is we would have been better to share a couple of those seafood dishes between us because we were full to the gills. Whether you like to order dishes to share or prefer your own dish to savor, this is the place.  From my seat I could see Chef Sara Kelly and her kitchen team working to create fabulous food. Imagine the skill needed to be able to produce this kind of excellence five days week!\n\nSERVICE:  EJ made wonderful food taste even better through the quality of her service in striking the exactly right balance of professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  She clearly loves her job and made us love our experience there.  She could answer our questions about the restaurant, the menu and also those we asked about ingredients in various dishes.  Her timing of plates to the table was perfect.  Her handling of the wine service for both bottles was expert (and she was gracious when some was spilled by us and needed cleaning).  We felt extremely well tended but never rushed or hovered over.\n\nMENU: Cleverly and logically arranged at the same time to make it both fun to read and easy to follow for understanding all a-la-carte options.  The only difficult thing is choosing among excellent alternatives and leaving room for dessert. (Lemon meringue pie has true French meringue!)   Daily specials offered separately.  Prices run @$3 - $22 regular menu and specials.  See menu link here.  http://eatatpetite4.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/DinnerMenu_FINAL.pdf \n\nLIBATIONS: Good wine list with several by glass (@ $8-11) and many by bottle (@ $30-78) from both domestic and European vintners.  We chose bottles but noted the couple next to us received generous by-glass pours.  Top quality stemware is used.  Being old winos...umm long time oenophiles...we appreciate these things.  There are also creative house made sodas, some beers and French Press coffee.  \n\nDESIGN DETAILS:  Every element, from interior to table settings to menu format, is perfectly woven together in the sophisti-whimsy hallmark style of the Kellys with ambiance that nearly says \"Bienvenue!\" right out loud.  This is loving care translated to the visual.  From the green ceiling, with an artichoke painted on it over the open kitchen, to the gold-colored upholstery on tufted banquette backs and high chairs at bar, to café chairs at tables, to gold and white geometric wallpaper, to round mirrors, to patterned floors, to mismatched flatware, to quality dishware, to bistro cloth napkins, to the pinstriped aprons worn by servers, it is all \"aaahh...\"somely done.  \n\nSEATING:  9 or 10 standard height two-top tables with banguette backs and cafe chairs on the aisle side that seat maybe 18 - 20.  Another 7 or so upholstered high seats at the bar.  A few backless metal stools tucked at kitchen counter.  Kitchen counter seating is for walk ins.  If you need standard height seating, be sure to ask for a table when you reserve.  \n\nACCESSIBILITY: ADA parking near front door.  Level in the door and all on one level.   Ample aisle space from door to tables.  Looks like wheelchair space for seating on aisle side of tables. (I have MS so notice.)\n\nLOCATION & PARKING:  Bench neighborhood.  Private lot.\n\nSPECIAL EVENTS:  Introducing monthly European brunches and monthly prix-fixe Sunday dinners. See web site.",

  "text": "Seven Things to know about the Feast of the Seven Fishes Christmas Eve Dinner here:\n\nUno: Acqua e Farina (Water and Flour), owned by the same owners as Vecchia Osteria, is usually a pizza place, but for Christmas Eve, they transformed into a seafood lover's dream, and like, the number 7, we were lucky to be able to attend!\n\nDue: The menu was small (7 dishes, and actually 10 fishes!) but everything was delicious (yep, we ordered the whole menu for 4 people, and had a LOT of leftovers). Gluttony is clearly my family's favorite of the 7 deadly sins.\n\nTre: The menu included a calamari and fried smelts appetizer and two gigantic salads (arugula, shrimp, and octopus, and a salted cod and cauliflower salad), lobster ravioli (so good it was the only dish we didn't have leftovers of), a heaping portion of linguine de mare (clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp in spicy red sauce), lastly, a branzino with sauteed spinach and Chilean sea bass with tomatoes and toasted bread to dip (both incredible). For dessert they were out of cannoli but we had a delicious (and surprisingly light) limoncello vanilla cake (tiramisu and a chocolate cake were also available). We were so full, but basically in 7th Heaven.\n\nQuattro: The service was amazing- they coursed out the dishes for us since we were eating family style (definitely recommend doing so), and our waitress told us all about her family's Italian roots and traditions. We started with a complimentary roasted veggie appetizer, and finished with housemade chocolatecello on the house!\n\nCinque: It wasn't too crowded but they could accommodate parties as large as probably 7 at one table, maybe more. The restaurant can probably seat about 50 max. We called ahead to make a reservation.\n\nSei: The ambiance was lacking a little bit (bright lights and a pizza place with a big oven...) but we still had such a good time! \n\nSette: Don't forget to BYOB!\n\nIf you're looking to change up your Christmas Eve traditions (we're not actually Italian) or just trying to avoid cooking for your family on Christmas Eve, I highly recommend it! Buon Natale!",

  "text": "Bummer. Seriously, it totally bums me out that Half & Half is closed on Monday. Monday is one of my days off, so that is one day less that I get to go enjoy the delectable delights at H&H. I feel so cheated, but once I do get to eat breakfast or lunch here, I'm thankful for my other days off. I'd be hard pressed to choose which meal I like better; breakfast or lunch. I love them both so much. Their famous Bloody Mary with a Fried Pickle garnish goes perfectly with either meal. \n\nOne of my favorite vegetables is Brussels Sprouts and until I came to Half & Half, I would have never thought to put them in a omelette. Now that I have had one, it is so logical. A fresh vegetable, served up with Cheddar cheese creates a delicious overstuffed omelet. The sprouts were sautéed perfectly and as a side they served up a side of breakfast potatoes that were fried crisp. I couldn't resist, I had to add a side of bacon. I think next time I'll have them add the bacon to the omelet. This is by far my favorite omelet of all time.\n\nWhen it's lunchtime at Half & Half, it's time for a burger. I love jalapeños, on my Mexican food and I love'm as a topping on my burger. H&H slices fresh jalapeños and mixes them up with caramelized onions.  Then they top the entire burger with cheddar cheese and place it on a  brioche bun with aioli. The final result is a thick and juicy burger with a side of house cut fries. \n\nWhether it is breakfast or lunch, you cannot go wrong at Half & Half. Just remember, they are closed on Monday and are only open for the first two meals of the day. No dinner is served.\n\nThese last two visits I've been seated at the bar and I will say the service was better then when I have been at a table or booth. If you are dining alone or just two of you, I highly recommend that you belly up to the bar. \n\nWhen: May 24 & June 8, 2016\nWhy: Lunch & Breakfast",

Many a time I have peered in their packed windows while stuck in traffic along the busy and congested 109th St. So for once I thought I would poke my head in. \nWhat I thought was going to be a jam packed store full of vintage junk and oddities and trinkets, turned out to be a very cleverly purchased store full beautiful wood furniture, and smart decor. There were some exquisite reclaimed wood tables that were huge over sized pieces. Iron decorations, beautiful real Teak candle holders (that are at the top of this girls Christmas list for Santa) but the coolest thing was all the amazing clocks! Old fashioned fans/phones/planes/movie lights (etc) with clocks attached to them. I think I could have found something neat for everyone in my family at this store. I have to say, I was impressed. Oh, and the lady that helped me out was quite lovely (even though she mentioned she hates yelp!) Ha ha, can't win 'em all!",

  "text": "I finally made it to Khyber Pass Pub on a non-beer event day. However, with that draft list, every day is informally a beer event in my eyes. Not to mention, they do have a knack for hosting some pretty killer events, especially surrounding Beer Week in June. \n\nThe bar area was pretty full but not packed so my husband and I were able to find two adjacent seats immediately. We had already staked out our brews on Philly Tapfinder and just needed a quick confirmation from the bartender that they were still available. We were in luck, they were! \n\nThe draft list will obviously vary, but during the time of our visit there it was a total sour-palooza. Jackpot!  US breweries I've been longing to try in addition to some European brews were well represented. I was not disappointed. \n\nNeeding a little snack, we also ordered bowls of the brisket chili and chicken gumbo. Having recently been to NOLA, it wasn't quite the same southern flare, but tasty in its own right. The chili had heaping portions of meat in addition to sour cream, jalapenos and some toasted bread on the side. Likewise, the gumbo had hearty pieces of chicken and didn't skimp on the rice. Neither were super spicy but had a nice flavor. \n\nThe bartenders were efficient, in addition to promoting a chill atmosphere. \n\nThe only thing I didn't enjoy about my experience was the price tag. But that is the price to pay with a stellar, and fairly rare-to-Philly beer selection.\n\nKhyber is amongst the Philadelphia brew scene's finest for sure.",

The shop was busy with tourists and students but that is to be expected since it was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  \n\nThere is no \"line begins here\" sign. You just push in wherever there is space, get someone's attention and place your order. I noticed they had unique flavors like Mexican hot chocolate and lavender honey. After requesting a few samples, I went with a scoop of salted caramel. Creamy and good.  The service wasn't exactly warm and friendly . More like blunt with no personality.

Order at the counter and wait for them to call your name or number. Self-serve water, napkins and utensils. Plenty of seating amongst the long farm-style tables and chairs.\n\nI'm really happy to witness the evolution of Helena Avenue Bakery. It started out small, with a very limited menu.

Of course when it rivals the likes of Dunkin, Fourbucks, and Saxby's as competitors that does only say so much at times. But it does help that Passero's provides a good variety, tempting baked goods, service with a smile, and a friendly hipster vibe.\n\nThe best deal is by far their flavor and coffee of the day. But they do have a good share of lattes and other drinks to go with the change of the seasons. Really the only flaw to (at least this) Passero's by my book is that its severely limited by being a kiosk in a train station as random and disjointed as Suburban is. Because with the exception of the atmosphere of its environment, and as far as being able to chill and get some work done coffeehouse style from within, Passero's delivers every key thing that I look for when getting my cup of Joe better than most other coffeehouses do.",

  "text": "I've encountered Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) on many occasions throughout my adult life. \n\nIt all began, I suppose, not long after my high school graduation. I'd won a scholarship to University of Indianapolis, but it was obvious the scholarship paled in comparison to the actual tuition. It simply wasn't going to happen. \n\nThen, I briefly tried going to Indiana University in Bloomington. Let's just say I partied a bit too much. \n\nFinally, I returned home. \n\nI don't want to say it has been a long time since I was a student at IUPUI, but back then they were called the \"Metros\" not the Jaguars and my theater classes were in the Mary Cable Building - an old elementary school with no elevator (and yes, back then it was acceptable). \n\nWhile IUPUI was really birthed in 1969, it still hadn't really found its presence in Indiana despite already being the premier urban research college in Indiana. \n\nI was a theater major and it was at IUPUI where I really discovered my creative voice and even won the collegiate state forensics championship. I was even in the first round of IUPUI trying to have frats (Go Delta Sigma Phi!). \n\nI enjoyed the campus, though at that time it was entirely a commuter campus. A good amount of the current growth was non-existent. If I remember right, the Mary Cable Building was where the law school is now. \n\nI was on the Sagamore, the school paper at the time, and even that's gone. \n\nOver the years, of course, IUPUI has grown astronomically in numbers and influence. It remains the primary urban research college in Indiana and actively teaches a good majority of the residents who work at Riley, IU, and Methodist Hospitals. \n\nThere are over 550 academic study options between IU and Purdue at IUPUI. The school has a much more active sports life and the National Institute of Fitness and Sport is acclaimed and has amazing options for those of us with disabilities. \n\nIUPUI is also one of the city's premier employers - I've worked here a couple times with it usually being either temporary or contract work. \n\nI ultimately left IUPUI - partly because I still partied too hard and partly because I just didn't blossom in such a large setting. I ended up transferring to a smaller private college where I truly blossomed, though I really appreciated my time at IUPUI and have enjoyed opportunities to return several times to speak to nursing classes, social work classes, and medical classes about disability. \n\nI have been a guest speaker at their \"Take Back the Night\" events and continue to be impressed by the school's growth including building campus housing. \n\nIUPUI is ideal for someone who wants a more affordable degree here in Indy. The campus is quite beautiful, though it's certainly grown up since my student days. \n\nI was on campus recently to speak to a class and was amazed that the food options continue to be a bit weaker than you might expect. I also still tend to find parking abysmal, though typically the parking garages work for both campus and the hospitals. \n\nI'm also a chaplain now and occasionally visit the hospitals and always have a good experience. \n\nAs a fun fact, there are tunnels underneath the hospitals that are very old school. They are generally quite safe, but still kind of creepy in a fun way. \n\nIUPUI also offers a really good counseling center and I'd rate it second, to Ball State, in terms of accessibility for students with disabilities.",

There are three main parts to this establishment; a BYO restaurant where you can have a nice dinner, a take-out type section where you can also enjoy a quick slice and a liquor store.  \n\nTake-out is probably my favorite option.  You can call ahead to place your order, run into the liquor store to grab the perfect bottle of red or white, then pick up your dinner.  Dinners come with a roll and a pretty large side salad, and the entrees are huge (without compromising on quality) and delicious.  I highly recommend the pasta with clams and red sauce.  The red sauce is homemade with plum tomatoes and fresh garlic.  Soooooo good!",

As i began to browse i was quickly drawn in by the garments. Beautifully made clothing, and name brands hiding inside the numerous racks. \n\nThe dressing rooms were plenty though a bit on the uncomfortable side, with hospital lighting and no real tact to style, but hey, you can't have it all. \n\nI tried on a handful of things, only one of which was a keeper. A Nick Cave type top (Nick Cave the visual artist by the way, not the singer, i hear there is more than one famous Nick Cave), anyway this top was full of sequin and color. A bit overpriced at $25 but i liked it enough to bite the bullet so i caved (pun intended).\n\nIt was cold so i also bought a pair of black gloves with elegant black beading ($10), made me think of the 1930s though they were obviously modern and in brand new condition. \n\nI checked out the jewelry on the case by the register and saw some pieces i really wanted, but again, overpriced and didn't need them. \n\nThey have a large selection of Brand Names, including a whole section of St. John's clothing at relatively reasonable prices. \n\nA little chaotic to browse. So much stuff you can become overwhelmed and not sure where to begin, or where to end, or when you've seen it all. \n\nParking lot for customers is a plus!\nLadies behind the counter were patient and friendly, though service was a bit slow.\n\nNote: Don't come here expecting authentic vintage garments from the ages, but do expect to find quality brand named items at slightly above average prices in great condition.",

What was really nice is that I was splitting this dish with someone, and the kitchen served us two plates!  Great gesture!\n\nYou need to get the steamed chocolate dessert.

Walking in you immediately see the buffet set up. The brunch buffet comes with an omelet station, carving station, ice cream station that has a freshly waffle bowls. Also, there was another station with, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, french toast and much more yumminess. Basically there was a little bit of everything including some delicious brie, oysters and peel and eat shrimp. My inner fatty took over and I basically tried a little bit of everything. The buffet also comes with your choice of 2 mimosas, bloody marys, or screwdrivers included in the price. After 2pm they are just 2 bucks! The quality isn't like oh my gosh out of this world, but I love the fact that you have so much to choose from, it is yummy and the price is fantastic for what you get. The only slight complaint I would have is that I had to hunt down the waitress for our check. We ended up waiting a while to get her attention. Other than that, I really enjoyed the place. They have a large bar and the outdoor area look cozy and fun to hang out at for maybe a sunday sunday of sports watching.",

It was restaurant week as well, so let's squash all of those \"bad service\" and \"small portions\" thoughts out the gate. \n\nLet me start with service. Ricky was an A-list server for sure. He was upbeat, professional and attentive. He had a knack in customer service, which stood out in his interactions with my table and the tables around us. I felt like he played to my group, but in a good way; a way that made us feel like he understood a little bit about us as customers. \n\nThe food was also on it's A-game. My husband and I wanted to split everything except for our entrees (where we both opted for the same thing), but had to deal with my pesky cough and a fear of spreading germs. No problem- Ricky accommodated our appetizers by splitting the butternut squash bowl of soup into two smaller cups. For the dessert, he provided sharing plates and a knife so we could divide and conquer. \n\nThe butternut squash soup was rich, creamy and delectable. The maple glazed bacon was packed with flavor, and had very little fat for bacon, so it was meaty. The meat, oh the meat. The filet was by far one of the best filets I've ever had. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, but still had a warmth too it. I go to a steakhouse for the meat and was not disappointed. It was 8 perfect ounces of melt-in-my-mouth enjoyment. The lemon tart was good, but the chocolate torte was where it was at. \n\nThe ambiance of this steakhouse was top notch with class with the high ceilings and majestic décor. We couldn't help ourselves but to look at the grandiose chandeliers from time to time.   \n\nWe were happy from the moment we entered Butcher and Singer through our final bites and departure. Every aspect of our experience and meal was excellent, and something I would consider as perfection.",

The owners have curated a small but mighty collection of jewelry, artwork, candles, home decor, baby gifts, accessories, greeting cards, and more.\n\nThe shop is small but filled with lots of great treasures.

Shopping local is so important, and you can never beat the quality of something handmade with so much love. Supporting local is the only way to shop.\n\nThe shop owner was present (I feel bad I forget her name) but very excited to talk about her store. They also had a great selection of unique cards and baby gifts. If you needed to assemble an impressive gift, you could absolutely do it here with ease! If I lived in the area, this would be my go-to spot for original and thoughtful gifts that sparkle. They also carry Philadelphia-branded items like pillows, mugs, etc. You can also shop their items online with shipping, which is amazing! You're going to love this shop.",

The lounge and office area was very clean and the staff that I dealt with were all friendly and to the point.\n\nThey saw me very quickly, I think I had to wait about 5 minutes before getting to speak with the nurse and from there it took about 15 minutes to see the doctor. No complaints with their assessment or treatment. The only thing that sucked was that they didn't send the prescription directly to the pharmacy. Instead, I got a paper copy. Unfortunately, when I arrived to CVS St around 845pm, the pharmacist couldn't read it so they had to call back and clarify everything. Luckily, Premier was still open and they were able to catch the doc. If they hadn't been open, I probably would have been a bit pissed off since I wouldnt have been able to get my meds for another 12 hours.\n\nAnyway, everything worked out well and I'm thankful there's such a nice urgent care option in this part of Bucks.

  "text": "After a bunch of hype we had heard that Chef Ron's has the best gumbo ever, we were SUPER excited about it. As we approached closing time on a Thursday night, we decided to try our luck at a table for 6. However, it was so busy and the restaurant is pretty small so we ended up ordering to go. \n\nThe gumbo was not bad. But it also was a bit underwhelming. After perusing the menu, we settled on ordering just two of the three gumbo options - seafood and the Mumbo Gumbo. We also got an order of boudin balls, two orders of jambalaya, a side of Mac and cheese and a bread pudding. \n\nThe boudin balls were great! Even after taking our food to go, they were still hot and fresh and crispy. It didn't come with the sauce that it usually comes with, though, per the pictures on Yelp. Even so, they tasted pretty good. However, the classic seafood gumbo was underwhelming and lacked the flavor we were expecting. The mumbo gumbo had a bit more flavor, thanks to the addition of some andouille sausage and chicken. A big mistake was getting our food to go because our gumbo didn't come with enough rice. We got two large servings of gumbo, we thought we would have gotten a little more rice than two small containers. The jambalaya was the biggest disappointment. I wouldn't recommend. It was not the right consistency, a little wet, although maybe it was due to us taking it to go. It wasn't flavorful and the pictures were definitely better than the taste. The Mac and cheese was just Mac and cheese, nothing special. But the bread pudding! We should have gotten 5 orders of this, and 86'd the jambalaya and mac and cheese. \n\nOverall, Ron's was a pretty underwhelming experience. Maybe the way to go is to eat in the restaurant - reviews have been raving about service, which may complete a 4-Star dining experience.",

To be honest, I had no idea this place existed until a coworker, Jonathan T., visited and myself and Brett N., my boss/last Tampa Bay CM, came up with places to take him. The email exchange went like this:\n\nJ: I'm planning to eat healthy while in Tampa.\nB: We need to go get Chinese pizza.\nJ: Hell yeah we do.\n\nWhen I brought up the ridiculousness of this exchange, I was basically met with, but it's Chinese pizza! Who was I to argue, I wasn't planning to eat healthy, so we put it on our list to check out. \n\nSaturday afternoon, about 12:30 p.m., and we are the only table in the restaurant. If you have little kids, they only have one high chair. I was victorious in getting it and I heard families after me ask and be told there were no more high chairs. It's a small place, so the one high chair thing isn't the most ridiculous thing ever, just a little surprising. \n\nIt's in a strip mall and the restaurant itself is a little jank, but the food is legit. They make fresh dumplings on the weekend so we had to try that. We also got a scallion pancake and this stuffed with chive dish that I could never understand what the waitress was calling it. Then we finished this order with a Mapo Tofu pizza, Chicken Terriyaki pizza, and General Tso pizza. \n\nI couldn't try the dumplings because they had pork, but everything else was amazing. Admittedly, the Mapo Tofu pizza was everyone's least favorite, but it was still good. I wasn't a fan because I don't like spicy food. The Chicken Terriyaki and the General Tso pizza were amazing. It has a sweetness to it, even in the crust. The combination just works. They also do not skimp on the cheese. The best part, these pizzas are only $10! For 7 people we walked away paying $70 not including tip and we were stuffed. We basically took home over half of the Mapo Tofu pizza. \n\nFor the price, quality, and novelty, this place cannot be beat. I'm lucky it is about half an hour from my house or else my husband would easily be 10 lbs heavier.",

Even on a cold, wintry weeknight the place was jammed at 6:30 pm (okay, it was ALMOST the weekend).\nHad dinner at the bar with a good friend, and Armand -- barkeep extraordinaire -- took good care of us. Nice selection of wines by the glass here, and 4 beers on tap, in addition to excellent cocktails. The wine is a generous pour, unlike some Princeton eateries I could name. The ambiance at the bar here is very cozy, friendly, and a nice blend of old, rustic Lambertville, and hipster Lambertville.\nThe menu is mostly skewed toward Italian fare, and they do offer gluten free pasta options if you wish (or need, like moi). I ordered chicken & escarole over GF pasta, with a red sauce. For some strange reason the pasta came out very underdone (almost \"crun-chewy\") which was a disappointment since the dish looked so delicious, and I was hungry! No problemo, Armand whisked it away, and back to the kitchen it went. I was worried this would cause a long delay, but thankfully, it only took a few minutes, and my dish was back, properly cooked.\nA less hungry person might easily have taken half this dish home for the next day, but I scarfed it all down, and left happy & full. \nThe prices here are not cheap, for either drinks or food, but you do get a very nice meal, and professional service. As I noted, if something does go awry, they fix it quickly. \nMake the effort to stray off the main drag next time you're in town, and find Deanna's. It's worth the hunt.",

I do know that I want fast, cheap and NOT greasy burgers or lame sammiches.  \n\n\"Hey lets try Hong Ko.....no, that food just was not right the last time.\"  Oh wait, we liked Panda Express the last time we went, and we do have that cool little coupon for a free \"entree\".  Alright.  Let's do that.\n\nVroom.\n\nI dunno.  Maybe I just have really low expectations from Chinese places because this place does it pretty good.  The food all seems to be slathered in sugary substances..but hey, it's fast food.   However the thing that puts these guys on a four star is their chow mein.  It's got like 30% cabbage and veggies!  It's also not \"spaghetti\" but real nice chow mein noodles!\n\nRight now they are serving some sorta Thai Chicken.  Good for fast chinese food standards.  NO MSG!  Also they have decent egg rolls.  Clearly they are mass produced but again.  Low priced chinese fast food.\n\nThey serve Pepsi products.\n\nService.   Hmmm.  It's a little weak, but really.  It's FAST chinese food, like what you get at a mall.  But a little better.  I also like that you can actually see all the food being made behind the counter.\n\nSo would I go back?  Definitely.  Dinner for three people for less than $20!\n\nWould I recommend them to a friend?  Yep.  In that category (low priced chinese fast food) I can't think of anyone better.  Can you?",

  "text": "Humm....So if some of you would remember my check in's on my many SF nites and wonder if I had a problem, well I know some of you we're suprised to realize I didn't, and in fact I worked in a club or two at one point of time. For some of yous..this is your first time hearing about it. Now lets skip forward and let me tell you the tale of the \"Gentlemans Club\" with two names. Is this place \"Platnum Dolls\" or is it \"Peppermint Hippo?\" well it forsure is the other mint and a whole different animal if you get my drift..only some will get what I ment about that statement lol. But the entertainment here was indeed on a different level and I have to say that for birthday festivities, on a \"bronze, silver, or gold\" scale this one is definitely \"platnum\" status. Seeing I don't venture to these establishments too often anymore, (Not that we could even if we wanted too in the last year or so) but this time was a celebration and I needed some..\"therapy\" yet let's just run with that. Now let me tell you why \"Peppermint\" with always be a cool \"Hippo\" in my book..\n\n\"Peppermint Hippo\"\nLocation - Reno, Nv\nPrice - $25.00 x5\nEntertainment - Well, let's just say money was spent :)\n\nPeppermint Hippo Reno:\nThe \"Peppermint Hippo\" is a fairly newer brand in the nightlife industry. The cartoon \"South Park\" did parody the name in reference to the Deja Vu owned \"Spearmint Rhino\" (my pun from earlier) and this club is new to Reno..kinda. Even the staff here is getting use to the new moniker and the comparisons to the other minty animal club. Reno has it's options for Gentlemans Club/Cabarets in the area, but this one was a no brainer from my initial call to check on accomodations for my homies and I. The hostess on the phone here was a lot more friendly as compared to two other similar establishments I called and they were nice enough to make sure my party had a spot reserved for our visit upon arrivial.\n\nWe arrived and received some of the best service I've experienced in a while in this type of establishment and we even were given a cocktail waitress to tend to our table. The main thing about \"Gentlemans Clubs\" is making sure the patron is happy, the drinks are good and the entertainment aspect of the establishment is top notch. I would step out on a limb and say they knocked it out of the park in every area. Like if I lived in Reno, this would be a place I would definately like to work for....not for the reasons that some may be thinking. The DJ wasn't annoying as some could get and the..entertainment for the night was indeed entertaining. The lighting matched the overall theme of the club although outside....it goes back to that little tale of two clubs thing (Signage still says Platnum Dolls). I will say at the end of my visit, I was satisfied and the impression left was pretty good.\n\nOverall:\n\"Peppermint Hippo\" is a pretty nice establishment. It's got everything you would expect for the type of business it is. The service was supurb, the venue itself was very well kept and classy, and the overall vibe is just what I was looking for being a visitor to a establisment that is similar to ones I've worked for in the past. I would recommend this club to anyone looking to have a good evening out with friends. If you're a creepazoid however....don't go here killing the vibe. I would be visiting this club of two names again in the near future.",

  "text": "This is the best restaurant in Lansdale.  Their red curry is fantastic.  Their green curry is fantastic.  Their coconut soup is fantastic.  Their $8.95 lunch special is fantastic, as it gets you a soup, appetizer(or salad) and entree.  I love Nadia Thai.\n\nSo why the 2 stars?\n\nBecause today I got a takeout order for myself and two coworkers.  When I arrived back at the office to display the bounty of my lunch run, I noticed there was no rice.  I called them up and the interaction went something like this:\n\nNADIA THAI WORKER - Hello Nadia Thai.\nBRAD - Hi.  I just got a takeout order from you guys.  Two people here got the red curry lunch special and there was no rice.  I'm a 20 minute drive away and won't have time to come by and get it before work starts again.\nNADIA THAI WORKER - Oh I'm sorry about that.  If you'd like, I can give you two free orders of rice the next time you come in.\nBRAD - Really?  I don't really think I will want two extra orders of rice with lunch next time.  Lunch comes with rice anyways.\nNADIA THAI WORKER- Well, how can I keep your business?\nBrad - I'll take two free lunches to compensate for the two that aren't acceptable currently.\nNADIA THAI WORKER- Hang on I will get a manager\n(Hold)\nMANAGER - Hello.  I don't think I can give you a free lunch.  I can give you free rice.\nBRAD - Look, this is my favorite restaurant in Lansdale.  I definitely want to come back, but I don't think extra rice is sufficient for customer satisfaction in this case.\nMANAGER -  The rice is cheap.  It is like a dollar per order.\n(the conversation continued and in the end I got 5 bucks off my next lunch after arguing for a while).\n--\n\nThai red curry without rice is like a sandwich without bread.  Let me repeat this because it is the point of my entire review - \nGiving me Thai Curry without rice is the equivalent of giving me a sandwich without bread.\n\nIf you give me a sandwich without bread on a takeout order, then I don't want extra bread when I order another sandwich the next time I come into your restaurant.  I want A NEW FREAKING SANDWICH.  The first sandwich was defective.\n\nThis problem was compounded by the manager's statement that he's OK giving me extra rice because it was cheap.  This is awesome because it allowed him to articulate the exact cost of what he believed to be my customer satisfaction - 2 dollars.\n\nLet's say I did take him up on his asinine peace offering.  OK, so there we are, two people with a full lunch combo, each with an extra mound of rice that we aren't going to eat because the lunch combo alone is ample food for an adult.  Since we don't eat the extra rice, it ends up being thrown out.  What a waste.\n\nThere was a huge discrepancy between Nadia Thai's view of the problem and mine.  They thought I was mad because I did not have two orders of rice.  I thought I was mad because the lunches of myself and my coworker were made less-than-awesome.  They did not owe us rice.  They owed us a great lunch.\n\nThe real problem with Nadia Thai is that I freaking love the food and even if they do start spitting on my order, it is probably still the best damn lunch in Lansdale.\n\nMaybe I'm kind of a dick for asking for two lunches, but we are living in a world where Pizza Hut sends out a new delivery driver with a free pizza when they mess up one topping.  I would hope that Nadia Thai would show more class than Pizza Hut when they screw up.",

Not typically what I would consider a park-like atmosphere.  More like Ybor Centennial Square?\n\nI always thought this location was a central bus hub, or something of the sort.  Mostly due to the amount of homeless folks hanging out here, asking for change, and living out of the public restrooms.  There are some covered areas, maybe where someone living in the area would want to sit and rest under the covered plaza, or a place for teenagers to gather in groups and harass the crap out of people at night.  Live chickens also live in this square, and you will see them walking around from time to time.\n\nThe space is ideal for festivals and outdoor events, that is probably why the market sets up here every weekend.\n\nAcross the street, there are parking lots that are free and open to the public during the days on the weekend.",

I sampled the Blackened Chicken Alfredo which I really liked so I decided to order that. The Blackened Chicken Alfredo was creamy and tasted like your usual pasta with Alfredo sauce. Half way through the Alfredo, it became spicy because they sprinkled a tad of red pepper powder. I couldn't handle the spice.\n\nMy boyfriend really liked the sample of Jambalaya so he ordered the a Cajun Meatloaf Platter with Jambalaya, and Corn bread, I was able to try a little bit of everything. The Jambalaya was quite spicy, couldn't handle it. The meatloaf was moist and tasty. I really liked the corn bread because it was moist, not too sweet, and had a great taste to it.\n\nI didn't feel too well throughout the day after having the food. I'm sure the other foods here are very good, but maybe Cajun food isn't for me.",

It was busy as fuck and the food came out super duper slow.  First I asked for 1lb of crawfish, but those bad boys are out of season. Not J's fault so no worries. Instead I went with fried crab claws and a soft shell crab boat, which is really just a soft shell crab on a buttery toasted po'boy roll split in half.  Verdict on my food- salty as sailor who's been at sea for years and years.  Not good.  The crab claw portion was fairly small and the crab taste got lost in the batter.  The soft shell crab didn't fully get eaten since I couldn't handle all that salt. \n\nThe other bad news was my friend who first ordered the jambalaya (I think).  Dude told her they were out, so she ordered a shrimp wrap (why the fuck would you order that when in New Orleans for a weekend, I have no fucking clue). 5 minutes later dude came back to our table to tell her they were out of that as well. He said the only things available were shown as samplers on the counter.  Not good, since the samples look unappetizing as hell. Whomever thought that was a good idea is sorely mistaken. She settled for BBQ shrimp.  6 or 7 shrimps with the heads on.  She said it was decent. \n\nAll in all, I will not be recommending this place to friends.  Not worth the time it takes to get your food nor the food that is delivered.",

The store was very clean an organized. Every employee had masks on.  All of the staff, from the people stocking the shelves to the cashier, were friendly and professional.  As I walked around the store, I was asked several times if I needed assistance. They had markers on the floor indicating  where 6 feet apart would be and had signs all around the store on the shelves with friendly reminders that we should socially distance to keep ourselves and others safe. You can buy online and pickup curbside and that's really helpful since we're going through this pandemic. The one thing I would say is you should bring your own sanitary wipes because they don't wipe down the carts or the little carriers so you can social distance all you want but if you touch that surface where somebody else was sick then those germs now belong to you too :-) So just give yourself some added protection, keep those wipes on hand. Which by the way,  you can buy at Big Lots! Big Lots has everything. I even picked me up some more Cafe Bustelo, cereal, and sarsaparilla :-)",

But then again, I don't know where I can eat that and watch a bare ass jiggle and keep my appetite. Love the 60's inspired throwback dancers shakin' what their mama gave 'em on the lit stage blocks here. Throw in some awesome music, fans blowing everyone's hair back and it is instant music video time. \n\nAnd then I find out that drinks are $4 and I figure that I'll have to make a pilgrimage here at least every few months.

Half Price Books is like that place of your youth, except everything is discounted, and the books and the CDs (and DVDs, and games, and other things) are all together in one store. \n\nThis particular Half Price Books is neatly organized, and it's easy to find what you're looking for. They even have an entire section just for kids toys and kids games. The prices for these things are really good, so I'm going to have to remember to visit when I'm looking for a birthday gift for a kid.\n\nThey also have a moderate section with graphic novels, most of which look new or almost new.\n\nBecause we are in the midst of a pandemic, I should mention that masks are required when you're inside the store. They also have signs on each aisle that suggest that only one person stand in the aisle at a time.",

The business owner and her story are awesome, and they make a damn good boba drink too! \n\nThey've got a wacky menu with some awesome combinations. If you're a fan of these drinks, you'll literally never get through it all because she keeps adding to it! Customers make requests and they often end up on the menu. Staff dream something up and it tastes great, it ends up on the menu. \n\nI mean, they have a mango sticky rice boba drink! Come on!\n\nI am a purist snd I don't love my drinks too sweet, so I'm thrilled they've got the basics covered and make them great! For boba, I like the Okinawa tea. It's got a slight toffee flavor, and at 50% sweetness it's perfect. My kiddo tried the strawberry milk tea with popping strawberry and was in heaven. I also tried a fruit tea with different coconut jellies in it and it was also super refreshing and incredibly beautiful too! \n\nBest of all, they serve Honey Bakery bao AND HK Egg waffles! \n\nSo stoked a location is open closer to my house because it's just a lot of fun to be there.",

  "text": "The Great Southern Gun and Knife show is the \"big show\" that is held at the Pontchartrain Center several times per year. I have been going to these shows off and on ever since I was old enough to own a gun.\n\nThe shows haven't changed in years. The way it works is vendors rent tables from the show and sell their wares. You can find guns, ammo, knives, patches, beef jerky, survival gear, etc. at this show. The problem is that there are so many tables, it is easy to become bored. If I am just there to browse I usually only make it three or four aisles before boredom sets in. There are only so many overpriced pistols I can fondle.\n\nif you are looking for something specific, the show may be a good place to start, There are hundreds of guns on display so you can actually handle them prior to purchase. Many of the vendors are very knowledgeable as well so you can gain valuable insight into particular weapons. prices have always seemed high to me so I suggest internet research before purchasing a gun here.\n\nAt the most recent show, I did not find what I was looking for, but I did find a bunch of antique firearms. Many were very expensive, but it was cool to see guns that helped win the west and many different wars.\n\nIn summary, the gun show is entertaining, but once every few years is enough for me.",

  "text": "The word \"serene\" encapsulates my experience at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, despite visiting with several young children who wanted to touch everything. (You'd think, instead of \"serene\" it would be \"serenity now!\" But, I guess, thus is the magic of the IMA. Even with a gaggle of children in tow, the peace and beauty of the museum wraps itself around you.)\n\nThe Richard Wentworth exhibit that is suspended above your head as you walk into the entrance (\"False Ceiling -- Indiana\") is pretty amazing. It consists of hundreds of donated books hanging from the ceiling. Everything from cookbooks to romance titles to gumshoe crime novels were used to create the dynamic piece. \n\nThe museum has all styles and periods of art, but my favorite installation is on the third floor (I think? Maybe 4th floor.) It's the only artwork you are encouraged to touch! In a dimly lit room, you stand at the entrance to the room and observe what looks like a gray square painted on the wall. But as you walk closer to the square, with your hand outstretched, you soon realize that the artwork is not what it seems to be! I won't give away the surprise -- go see it for yourself! Kids get a kick out of it. (Heck, I got a kick out of it, too.)\n\nThere is a cafe on the first floor of the museum with lots of fresh, healthful food options. I got a sandwich and a bag of chips -- not too original, but both were really good! (They sell the fancy chips with seeds and stuff in them.) My meal was a little pricey (about $9), but I guess that's to be expected from a lunch at an art museum.\n\nOn a nice day, you can take your food outside and sit at one of the concrete planters just outside the museum -- that's what I did. In the grass just beyond this area are huge metal art pieces, as well as a big piece that spells LOVE. \n\nYou should be aware that the IMA does not allow backpacks to be worn inside the museum! I made the mistake of packing all my personal whatnots and kid-related stuff in a backpack and didn't bring a purse, so then I had to leave it in my car and just carry my wallet. It's kind of a bummer if you don't know this rule beforehand, so if you didn't know, now ya know!",

  "text": "Saki Endless Sushi & Hibachi Eatery is a great spot to fill up on \"All You Can Eat\" sushi, teriyaki, and hibachi-style meals for one low price. I didn't know what to expect, but a business associate assured me that the sushi was made fresh to order, and the $11 price tag for lunch is hard to beat.\n\nSaki is located along US 19, right at the intersection of Gulf to Bay Boulevard (Route 60). This corner is known as the Clearwater Mall, and Saki can be found facing US 19, behind Michaels, and in between Lowe's and Costco. It's a bit tricky to find, but well worth the effort.\n\nAt lunchtime the restaurant fills up quickly, so plan to get there before the lunch rush. Once seated they hand you the menu and explain that you can order ANYTHING on the menu for the one flat price. Yes, anything.....and as much as you want. The only kicker is that if you leave food, or rice balls on your plate that you'll be charged a \"piggy fee\" and made to wash dishes for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nSo let's say that you check out the menu and decide to order a cup of Hot 'n Sour soup, or maybe some gyoza dumplings, and then a couple of pieces of traditional sushi, and maybe a maki roll or two -- and it's all one flat rate. Your dining companion might choose eggrolls, chicken wings, hibachi steak and some teriyaki shrimp -- and it's also one flat rate.\n\nYou can order sushi and sashimi either a la carte or on a platter, along with a surprisingly good variety of basic rolls and signature rolls. If you prefer the more traditional Americanized-Asian entrées you'll see sweet & sour pork, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, etc. From the hibachi grill they have steak, shrimp, chicken, salmon, veggies and more. Then finally they have teriyaki steak, chicken, shrimp, and salmon. That's right -- everything for one flat price, so mix 'n match to your heart's content.\n\nI saw at least five different chefs behind the sushi counter slicing up the fish and making rolls as fast as their fingers could fly. I'm sure there were equal numbers of folks back in the kitchen preparing soups, salads, appetizers, entrées, and desserts. Plus there was a large staff of servers checking in on each table to see if you wanted to order more food, refilling drinks, and whisking away empty plates. It was all operating very fast and efficient.\n\nThe lunch price is $11, and the dinner price is $18 for all you can eat. There's also a $16 Endless Sunday price. According to the menu you can order individual rolls and entrée items priced per item. I can only conclude that these are to-go orders since everyone else seems to be oinking their way through the AYCE deal.\n\nHeads up little porkers, if you like Asian food, and you're willing to strap on the feedbag and eat like there is no tomorrow, then you need to make a beeline to Saki Endless Sushi and Hibachi in Clearwater.",

Transport back to a time when travel was truly extraordinary. The Grand Hall has a 65-foot tall ceiling. The historic beauty helped achieve a top Railway Themed Hotel rating by Condé Nast.\nThe Union Station railway offers several restaurant options, including Hard Rock Cafe, Landry's and a variety of food court choices and nearby local restaurants.\n\nMy room was a recently upgraded part of the newer hotel wing #5004 for $159 or $186 with taxes. As a Hilton gold member I had access to their very nice Honors lounge, which included complimentary breakfast and evening snacks.

But the larger food prep space does allow them to engage the customer with a lot more presentation when they put together the many ingredients that goes into their chaat recipes. This can make for a good interactive show of sorts that caters to your customization; especially when you factor in the number of spices, nuts, fruits, and other ingredients that you can add. Add in some chaat recipes variations that take on influences from other cultures, and things really start to get interesting.\n\nAnother plus to Mood is that its menu puts much more emphasis into the lassi, ice cream, and hot beverage side of the menu, making it a great spot to go to please your sweet tooth and grab a beverage on the go.

  "text": "Sbraga was the restaurant my boyfriend selected for his birthday dinner. I had been anxious to get back since our first visit in December, and when I checked out the current menu I was even more stoked. We went all out and opted for the beverage pairing, but I started things off with a glass of sangria, which was super fruity and flavorful. \n\nThe first course really set the bar high. Housemade mozzarella with local tomatoes and fried clams appealed to all my Jersey girl senses. This was the perfect summer dish. \n\nNext up was parsley risotto with escargot and prosciutto. I love Sbraga's risotto. Art raved over his scallop and pork belly, but the plate that got the most attention was the tempura fried lobster tail that was sent out from the kitchen. Lobster has never been more tender. \n\nAt this point we were feeling pretty full and it was only halfway through the meal. Fortunately, the third course was presented in a smaller portion. My plate consisted of barbecue chicken confit, pickles, cole slaw and onion rings. Tasty and fun. \n\nThe dessert course at Sbraga is not an afterthought, but a vital part of the meal. I wasn't walking out of there without the mascarpone/coffee granita dessert from my previous visit, which was thankfully still on the menu. The boyfriend opted for a cherry coke dessert that was totally unique and really well executed. The kitchen sent out the strawberry rhubarb streusal, which was served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. So delish. \n\nOur second Sbraga visit was really pretty flawless. Service was excellent and everyone seemed to be working in harmony. The restaurant was also packed, which was awesome to see. I'm looking forward to our next visit, most likely after the menu changes up yet again!",

Easy going down and I  enjoyed the cocktail sauce.  \n- Abalone: Very tender (one of the guys in front was hard at work pounding them as we walked in.  We had four little abalone, which looked even tinier atop the delicious tomato rice, but I get it...seafood is expensive.  The only complaint about this dish is it was seriously swimming in butter.  We left a good layer of tomato rice on the bottom of the bowl as a makeshift \"drain\" so we wouldn't be eating 75% butter 25% rice.\n- Local Spiny lobster 1.5 Pounds:  This day, it came in either 1.5lb or 2.5lb.  Meaty, tender, but honestly kinda flavorless.  I didn't think it was worth the $63 and change.  It was so well presented, though, that immediately after setting ours down, our neighbor pointed to it and said \"I want one of those!\"\n\nCute local joint.  Love the tanks with all the fresh sea creatures.  \n\nNo reservations.  We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday, wrote our names down, and got seated at the bar in about ten minutes.  Note that the bar seating is also via list.  Several people tried to snag the bar seats and were told they needed to sign up.  They also have a small outdoor seating area and a to-go window with a long line as well.  \n\nBy the time we left (12:30ish), the waitlist was crazy!",

  "text": "Embarrassed that I waited so long to try The Independent. My husband and I rarely find ourselves in Seminole Heights, but last year we bought an annual zoo pass so we would stop by The Independent on our way home.\n\nThe beer selection is excellent and the food is pretty good too. I'm more of a wine drinker, but so far I have really enjoyed every beer I have tried. The bartenders are super friendly and always have great suggestions. My husband loves unique or hard to find beers and always manages to find a new beer to try.\n\nWe usually split a few appetizers. The charcuterie and soft pretzel are our go-to dishes. We have also ordered the brats and sauerkraut which are great. Need to try one of the sandwiches, but we always seem to visit between meal times when I am not that hungry.\n\nMy favorite thing about The Independent is that it is kid friendly. We usually visit during the afternoon when the bar is quiet. It is so nice to be able to grab some food and an adult beverage without paying a babysitter. Our toddler loves the food and enjoys sitting at the picnic tables instead of his usual high chair.",

  "text": "This place is totally reminds me of a restaurant that should be located off of some beach in Southern California. It has a light aura and a very breezy feeling to it. Not casual beachwear, but more like the spot reserved for a romantic post-beach jaunt.\n\nLovely. Light. Airy. Decadent.\n\nI'm met a colleague here for lunch. Arriving slightly early I found the service was uber attentive. I felt almost like a celebrity walking in. When I arrived, the hostess seemed genuinely happy for me to be there. It wasn't that awful pink, sugarcoated type of welcome that feels somehow sour. I might have guessed that she was the actual owner of this establishment. Same with the server. Very complementary and very helpful. \n\nI ordered the tri-tip sliders. This is a sizable order for lunch. I wasn't able to finish the meal, but I enjoyed it well. \n\nThe sliders are served in the form of a glorious cheesy biscuit. The biscuit has a wonderful herb flavor. Reminded me of chives and cheddar with a hint of saltiness.\n\nThe sliders were served with a sampling of potatoes which had a nice flavor of onion and red bell peppers. Nice accompaniment to the sliders.\n\nI will have to give this place another go. I was happy to see that you can order breakfast items up until 3 p.m. Also, they serve mimosas and they have duck confit.\n\nGreat location for a business meeting and, I'm sure, a lovely place for a romantic date.",

Main level - a band playing with a dance floor in front surrounded by loads of big tables; feels like a Vegas concert in a spacious room. More of an older crowd.\n2. Rooftop level - more top 40/hip-hop/EDM music and a really big dancing area. Rooftop outside doesn't have enough seats but has a fair amount of space. More of a younger crowd.\n\nDrinks come in a bigger cup than at Honky Tonk or Whiskey Row for the same price so that was a plus.\n\nThis place just opened up a few weeks or months ago but I think it will do pretty well considering our group had such a good time here.",

Conveniently located in the heart of downtown, and right across the street from our hotel, Big Red was the perfect place to stock up on beverages for the room. This place is your typical old school, mom and pop liquor store. While prices are a couple bucks higher than your average big box store, you just have to expect that. Plus you're #supportinglocal. They've got a large selection of all types of beer, wine, and liquor. And that staff was welcoming and polite. They've got a huge valut in the basement, which was cool and worth a visit, if just for that. If you find yourself in downtown Indy and in need of booze, check this place out.",

My terrier is always excited to come in as he gets so much loving and personal attention while my old Dalmatian does not live it as much. The staff is always understanding with the Dalmatian's old bones as she moves slow. Today was the first time she left with a smile. The staff must have taken extra care of her when giving her a tail trim, nail grind, ear cleaning, teeth cleaning, hair brushed, pad smoothing, cologne, and super cute Halloween bandana for just $23. She likes to dress up. She was really strutting her stuff when we were leaving. The terrier fell in love with his tech when she was doing his nails. The tech was getting so many kisses I was kinda getting jealous. They both looked great and had a good time. Thank you for your patience and loving care with my fur babies. We will definitely be back for more pampering.",

We sat at one of the many outdoor benches and ordered the smoked mullet and smoked salmon with German potato salad and cole slaw on the side. This also came with tartar sauce, and slices of onion, tomato, and lemon. The smoked mullet and salmon were both absolutely amazing (though my pick goes to the smoked mullet). The fish had an extremely deep, smoky flavor, and you could really taste the essence of the fish itself. Parts of the fillets were a little dry, making the tartar sauce a perfect light and refreshing complement. The potato salad and cole slaw were also excellent. The potato salad had chunks of bacon, which imparted a great smoky flavor and textural contrast, while the cole slaw wasn't too heavy and gave the perfect, refreshing crunch!",

Does he make good ice cream?\n\nWalking up, I see \"Blackberry Cornbread\". Sold! One scoop cone please.\nI grab my ice cream and sit up front. Wow! Mike, you did good. The ice cream is creamy, and the blackberry is dreamy. The corn bread is nice but it didn't allow the ice cream to stay together. A big hunk of ice cream fell (I caught it in my hand) at a piece of corn bread. \n\nI appreciate the fact that Mr. Mike made an interesting flavor.

  "text": "We had such a FUN Digital Date Night with a Free Online Class offered by Picasso & Wine.  We found the painting class via Social Media for a Friday date night option with all of the instructions posted.  You had the option to order painting kits from them with or without brushes (here's a link:  https://squareup.com/store/picasso-and-wine/item/complete-art-kit) or you could even paint along with your own supplies, talk about easy - now that's AWESOME!  There was a deadline to order the kits from them as their hours are limited, understandable with everything happening currently and they even offered delivery for the area around the studio.  With us living in Carson City we were limited on time with our work schedule for pickup but not to worry Picasso & Wine also shared another outlet for ordering additional supplies for the online class - they ROCK!  We opted for the online supplies and they arrived on time for the our digital date night.\n\nPainting was LIVE on Picasso & Wine Facebook page at 7pm PST with Jen giving detailed instruction that was a FUN pace.  We never felt like we were falling behind or not able to understand her, although she couldn't hear us we were able to give her thumbs up and hearts or type messages to her in the chat section of the live feed as we followed along.  My hubby and I truly enjoyed Jen and her husband as they playfully bantered back and forth, laughed, painted and successfully guided us through a GREAT date paint night.  Look forward to our next at home paint date night!\n\nHIGHLY recommend the online virtual painting classes ~ the instructors and painting are great FUN!!  Be sure to check out their upcoming classes, they have FREE ones for not just date night but for the kids and some that are only $10 - now that's AWESOME!!  Here is the class that we did for $10 (https://squareup.com/store/picasso-and-wine/item/happy-campers)  We also had the option (which my hubby and I took advantage of) to 'Donate To Our Artists Fund' by showing your appreciation to the artist that instructs the online paint class by going to the Picasso & Wine page here:  https://squareup.com/store/picasso-and-wine/item/donate-to-our-artists-fund - please let them know you appreciate them!\n\nBelow is the list of supplies we used for this class:\nArt Supply List: \n2-12x16 canvases\nPaints-Red, Lemon Yellow, Cobalt Blue, Ultra Marine Blue, Burnt Umber, White, Black\nBrushes-1\" Flat Brush, 1/4\" flat brush, #6 round brush",

I've only heard about Joe's but I was really excited to give it a try, especially the way a few of my friends were hyping it up. \n\nI had my large cheesesteak with onions and American cheese. It was perfection. The roll was fresh with a light crispness. There was just the right portion of onions. The meat was chopped but not too fine and not to thick. The cheese melted in perfect union with my steak, onions and roll. \n\nI also got a small order of the crinkle fries to split with my husband. My only complaint was that the order was too small (or maybe we were just too hungry to have been sharing fries). \n\nWe sat at the booths and I felt like we were in some sort of time warp at an old school diner. \n\nI'm only in this part of the northeast for the Firkenteenth, but I think I have myself a new tradition.",

Place has a nice Thai-style décor to it but man, when we first walked in, the place was hot! Also, there were only a couple of tables occupied...which I thought was pretty surprising. \n\nAnyways, for the food, like I said, we were starved so we ordered a couple of dishes to share:\n\n- 2x coconut rice ($2 each) - nice and fragrant. Coconut rice was da bomb.\n- Pad thai ($14) - noodle with shrimp, chicken, egg, bean sprout, green onion and crushed peanuts in a separate tiny side bowl with a lime on the side. Super tasty, slightly on the sweeter side for what I've had pad thai-wise.\n- Stir fried eggplant ($11) - awesome delicious. Make sure you order this dish! I'm a big fan of eggplant and these were perfectly coked.  Came with garlic, carrot, red pepper and basil leaves.\n- Green curry chicken ($14) - came with bamboo shoots, green and red peppers and basil leaves. Green curry is my fav and this one was excellent. Nice bit of heat to it (maybe it was slightly more spicy than I thought - that's what my friend said) and perfect compliment to go with the rice.\n\nI can't stress how good Numchok Wilai is! The front of the restaurant is very deceiving (meaning you'll pass it without even noticing if your not on the lookout for it). And did I mention how fast our food came out? Not even 10 minutes and everything came out piping hot and all at once.  Wish I worked nearby so I could get their super cheap lunch deals! \n\nGO GO GO. Good talk.",

Let's begin with the fact it is a BYOB with that in mind please pace yourself, not coming from my own experience or anything. The meal starts with a rose water hand wash and towels. You are given a large towel which i chose to just lay across my lap 1. I am clumsy 2. i was drinking 3. you use your hands to eat. Knowing this ahead of time I was a little scared being repulsed by double dipping (as I'm sure most people are) and finger licking but overall its not hard to use your pita in a hygenic way. By the time the fruit bowl came out we were all about to burst but made some room for feeding grapes off the vine. I really had a great time.\n\nI love herbs but was a little nervous that everything would be entirely over seasoned, I was pleasantly surprised because each plate was delicious and I even find myself craving it here and there. This was my first experience with Moroccan food so I had no idea what to expect. My favorite was the baked chicken with the spicy sauce which we ordered on the side just to be safe. Also, the baklava was what dreams are made of. Overall, the food, service, and experience were amazing and super fun. I think this would make an amazing first date. The belly dancer was so fun and friendly. \n\nI suggest ringing the door bell versus knocking because I kept knocking and knocking and no one could hear me, i rang the door bell once and they opened the door immediately. It is CASH ONLY so plan accordingly.",

We each had a drink and we split 3 of the happy hour starters and it was plenty for our meal! We split the bill and all that, with tax and tip was only $16! It was a steal!\n\nI had their draft cider, which was Angry Orchard cider and on happy hour for $4. I love Angry Orchard and it was great on a Fall night! We split the Mac and Cheese bites, margherita flatbread, and chicken tacos. I loved the Mac and Cheese bites! The sauce they came with was a little spicy and so addicting! We ended up pouring some of it on our chicken tacos because we couldn't get enough of it! The chicken tacos were great as well. I thought the margherita flatbread was just ok. The other two were definitely better and next time, I would probably try something other than the flatbread.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this restaurant for happy hour! Their deals are amazing and the food and drinks are great as well.",

What this place is, definitively, is a local diner, teeming with regulars, and good cheer and some storytelling mixed in for good measure. \n\nMaybe in that order and just perhaps, maybe not. \n\nEither way you shake it, I ended up here when another lunch timed out due to a characteristic New Orleans squall, and I soon found myself face first into a plate of fried chicken. They do specials by the bucket load here, and it's pretty likely that you'll encounter a room full of locals. I sat next to a six top that included one gentleman so advanced in years that you could have watched him sit via time lapse photography. This, of course, didn't deter the cheery hostess who knew him by name. That table showed one another lots of photos, told all sorts of stories, and I soaked up what I could. \n\nPrices a pretty cheap and you're a salt shaker away from the Monteleone, so if you have business there like I did, doesn't take long to get back. In a pinch, a hearty bite I needed.",

We met Trevor towards the end who's the grandson of the original owners from 1959!  Plaza is celebrating their 60th Anniversary this year and they even have cute merch to celebrate! \n\nWe selected a Plaza T-shirt sticker for $1 to go on our Thule.  Every time I see it I will be reminded of today's fun date! \n\nIt's a Tuesday afternoon so bowling was on special for just under $5 a game/person.  I enjoyed an adult bev and my son a Mountain Dew.  Our total for 3 games, 2 drinks, and shoes was just shy of $45.  It was a fabulous date!  (Oh and they have bumpers - thankfully!)\n\nThe washrooms were clean and funky with b & w tiles AND both the mens' and ladies' has changetables - two thumbs way up! \n\nPlaza Bowling is located along 118th Ave in a basement so if stair mobility is an issue, this might not be the place for you. \n\nNext time I'd like to try some of their food but today we continued our adventure by walking next door to Lan's. \n\n5 stars all the way - Can't wait to come back. \n\nPS Be sure to check out the cool memorabilia ranging from posters to vintage records held in 5 pin!  Oh and the COOL pins for turkeys (3 strikes) and the Britney Spares!  Yes, you read that right!!!",

It feels more like being invited to eat in someone's family kitchen instead of a standard restaurant visit.  Grandma is making making food in the kitchen while Grandpa and their son handle the dining room.  The family that runs this establishment is so friendly and welcoming.  \n\nThe menu is very simple and has standard Italian classics.  Everything is very reasonably priced and you get so much food for your money.  They start you off with bread and warm marinara sauce to dip it in.  The first time we came here we were all really confused when they brought out the salad because half of the plate was taken up by a huge veal cutlet (which is delicious and I am now completely addicted to).  It is included with every entree.  I've tried the stuffed shells, lasagna, eggplant parmesan, and ravioli.  It's all delicious and I've never been disappointed with a meal here.\n\nMy only complaint (and it is minor) is that they don't have chicken parmesan on the regular menu.  Sometimes they have daily specials, of which chicken parmesan sometimes makes an appearance.\n\nThis is my favorite place for Italian food in the Tampa Bay area.",

  "text": "Staying in Indianapolis for the first time gave me a great excuse to do some research on the best brunch places. Milktooth came up on a few lists I found and I discovered it was within walking distance from our Airbnb! My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Sunday morning at 9 am and most of the tables were already full. We snagged a couple seats at the very long counter and got to watch the food being made, which was really fun and a bit mesmerizing. They've got it down to a science there and everyone is in a constant state of motion. I watched one cook make like 5 grilled cheese sandwiches while we were there.\n\nAnyway! The atmosphere is bright and bustling, with a modern hipster diner feel. The menu is very unique and interesting, which drew me to Milktooth. This isn't a typical eggs and toast type place -- their menu ranges from Asian inspired to oysters to fancy homemade poptarts. I ordered the mushroom Dutch baby with a side of regular bacon, and my boyfriend got the sourdough waffle. Our food didn't take too long to come out and it was delicious! The Dutch baby was savory, super cheesy and rich, with a bit of red cabbage (listed on the menu as baby chard) to cut through all the goodness. The bacon was okay (regriddled previously cooked) but I wouldn't get it again. The waffle was delicious as well! Light and fluffy with a sweet and salty combo of honey, parmigiano reggiano, a thick slab of butter, and flaky sea salt. Definitely using that topping at home in the future.\n\nService was polite and quick, prices were a little high but worth it considering the quality of the food. Go early and get a spot at the counter!",

Because all of my beers went down easy!\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nCrooked Thumb was one of many Pinellas breweries that I've had on my to-do list, but I don't find myself in Safety Harbor too often. We actually were in the area to check out another brewery, and figured we'd swing by here as well.\n\nI had a flight, and every beer was solid, but none were spectacular. I would absolutely order any of them again: Tangelo Wheat, Vortex Swirl, Harbor Fest, Dubbel and Mixed Berry. I did wish that the vortex swirl was a bit thicker, but it had the same texture as the others. The Tangelo Wheat and Harbor Fest were my favorites in the group.\n\nOne interesting thing - their flights are served in giant glasses, that are about 25% full. The good thing about this is: more beer! Duh. Bad the bad thing is that it's definitely not convenient to carry from the bar to the table you're sitting at, as you can really only carry two of the glasses at a time. Also, if you don't like a beer, you're kind of stuck with a pretty decent amount. \n\nI would definitely love to visit Crooked Thumb again - add another awesome brewery to the Tampa Bay list!",

  "text": "Mixed thoughts on my experience at Sam's with three of my girlfriends on the last Saturday in February...  for context, our weather has been very hot lately, with comfortable nights in the low 70's. I'll start with the things that are really out of their control, but worth noting so other diners are prepared. First, parking was a challenge! Having never been to Hudson, I circled more than once just to figure out where the public parking was available, then another round and a lot of waiting in line in two different lots before I finally found an open but very tight spot (I found small scuffs & scratches on my door the next morning, possibly from people getting into their car next to me). Then, our wait for a table was nearly an hour and a half (which was not terrible for us; more on that later), but once inside I noticed they really didn't have many tables due to social-distancing. \n\nUpon joining the wait list & issued a pager, the hostess advised that we could not order drinks while we waited. However, my girl was not accepting that situation on our girls night! After walking through the parking lot toward the beach, she spotted a bus boy and asked him to find a server so we could order drinks. A few minutes later, a friendly server leaned over the railing to get our drink order (no specialty drinks on the sly), and brought them back very quickly with a payment device. We took our adult beverages to a picnic table at the adjacent public park to chat. Time flew by and then we were buzzed.\n\nAfter we were seated, I had to wander to another part of the restaurant to find the chalkboard list of beers on tap for my beer flight, which wasn't ideal, and then not all were available. One of my friends & I had substituted a side with our meals but we both received the fries AND the grits. Not a big deal, especially since neither of us were charged extra, but noted. Service was relatively slow, but it WAS a Saturday night and we weren't in a rush. The 80's music vibe was great and overall we enjoyed a fun night!",

Look, I cannot stand chain anything for the most part, but Cost Plus World Market is like a cheaper, bigger, better version of Pier One Imports. It's a smaller, more boutiquey, more *worldly* Bed Bath and Beyond. And the grocery section, while small, is just so much cheaper than Whole Foods. So sue me. I cannot resist WOMA's charms.\n\nI used to live quite close to one in KC and I was there an average of 2 times per week, picking up wine, candles, incense, seasoning, imported snacks, storage baskets, towels, outdoor lighting, bath products, hazelnut biscotti and more. Not to mention wickedly discounted Halloween decorations on November 1st. \n\nIt just has all of my favorite things in one store. Even the decor is right up my alley (though admittedly, too expensive when you consider some, not all, is made in China). I move a lot and tend to stop in here for things like rugs, curtains, bamboo mats etc. \n\nWant to read about my purchases made on Saturday? Too bad, you're going to have to! Wine glasses, pot holders, olive oil, incense, champagne, amber colored soup bowls, pink Himalayan salt aaaaand the coup de grâce, black truffle oil. For roughly 12 dollars, the bottle I bought is twice the size of the one I bought at Whole Foods for 18 dollars (I was desperate). \n\nWhat stops it from the fifth, elusive star. I'm a member of the World Explorer club (far too many emails) and yes, I may print the coupons out, but I always forget to use them. Why not just make it a given if you, as a member (who suffers through opening and deleting all those emails) are shopping there, that you get the 10% off without having to go to the trouble of printing and remembering? One other extremely annoying thing: they sticker just about every damn item, including all the wine glasses in a box of 6! These are a bitch to remove and it makes me ballistic to have bits of sticker left on glassware. WTH? This has to stop. \n\nOtherwise, WOMA, I just can't quit you.",

  "text": "This is a lesser known tourist attraction to the locals in Tampa. The Yuengling Brewery is located down the street from Busch Gardens and is the second largest Yuengling producing brewery in the US. Tours are FREE and all ages are welcome. On most weekdays, tours are at 10am,11am and 1pm. On Saturdays, the tours are at 10:30am and noon. If you want to get the full experience, visit on a weekday because there is no production on Saturdays. \n\nThe tour guides are phenomenal (I've been on this tour so many times that they recognize me when I return)! They walk you through several parts of the facility including the production line (which you can view through windows from above) as well as the chemistry room (no pictures allowed in here). The brewing process for Yuengling is extensive and quite impressive than other breweries in the area that you may have visited. There is a rail line that ends at the brewery to transport supplies by train. At the end of the tour, you are welcomed to sample the beers and hang out in the cozy lounge. There is also a gift shop with reasonably priced souvenirs. \n\nIf you like beer, or just enjoy seeing how beer is made, you must visit the Yuengling Brewery. It's a great free tour and they teach you so much about the Yuengling brewing process. I'll continue to return!",

We're especially fond of the German Chocolate Cake \nWe've been treating ourselves to a few special treats each week from our cellar during the Covid-19 crisis and enjoyed our Krampus this weekend. \nThis is an absolute must-stop trip on a Florida beer tour, especially if pastry stouts are your deal. Once we can travel and socialize again, I recommend visiting this Tampa treasure.",

  "text": "We had such a blast finally checking this spot off our bucket list. When Heartland Film Fest came to Tibbs, we couldn't not check it out. We bought our tickets online, arrived five minutes before we started, and had our tickets scanned on our phones at the entrance. The man working the ticket stand was so friendly and pointed us to the correct screen. He also gave us a slip of paper with the radio/sound info on it.\n\nWe easily found a parking spot at our screen (if you have a ticket beforehand, then there will be a spot for you) and ran into the snack bar. It reminded me of being a kid and getting to order at the school cafeteria for the first time. They had every type of junk food: pizza, fried chicken sandwiches, tenderloin sandwiches, fries, nachos, popcorn, pretzels, soft drinks, candy, cookies, or chips. None of the food was very good, but it was a good time to go all in. \n\nWe caught the \"A Call to Spy\" movie about women being recruited as spies in WW2 (true story). It was super interesting and the sound was good when we tuned into the radio station. The only problem is that we were kind of nervous that our battery would die the whole time, so had our car running for most of it. The car next to us had their battery die mid-way through the movie, so the Tibbs staff came over with their car jumping equipment. I'd feel a bit more comfortable returning if there were little speakers next to each car that let you just roll down your windows and turn off your car. \n\nNonetheless, we had a fun time and were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful staff, the large amount of cars at each screen and the ease of getting tickets.",

  "text": "I simply could not wait to get on Yelp and rave about my experience at Carrollton Market. The food and service were top notch and it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.\n\nWe made reservations so we were seated immediately upon arriving. I had been  in this space previously when \"One\" was here and I have to say I like the decor of CM much better. It's brighter and feels new and fresh.\n\nThe menu here is pretty simple, which I can definitely appreciate. We started with the Oysters Goodenough which is 4 grilled oysters topped with a cream sauce and bacon. If you are an oyster lover you MUST get this dish. It was incredible and I couldn't get enough. I almost wanted to order another plate for myself and just call that my meal. Check out my close up picture of the oysters and get ready for your mouth to start watering.\n\nFor my entree I got the potato crusted drum, which was served on a bed of brussels sprouts and other vegetables. The fish was perfect. The potato crust added a nice flavor and the fish itself was flaky and delicious. I've been on quite the seafood kick lately, as I've been eating out a lot, and this is perhaps some of the best I have had.\n\nWe skipped desert, but we did decide to get coffee. Even though our dinner was late (we arrived 30 minutes before closing- a usual \"no no\" in my book), we didn't feel rushed at all and the waiter was kind enough to let us take our time and chat. At one point I joked that we could take our coffee to go but he said he was happy to have some company as he cleaned up for the night. What a sweetie!\n\nThis place is fantastic and I will definitely return. I am so excited to bring friends here in the future.",

David gave me a very nice coffee maker, so I can make iced coffee at home, but I was in a pinch today so I thought I would stop in here and grab a quick cup. Big mistake. Huge. \n\nTime and time again they fill the entire cup with big chunks of ice and then put in the coffee. The result is a cup of coffee that I finish before the ice even melts. My grande was probably a quarter cup of actual coffee. Last time I asked them not to do this and they did it anyway. This time I totally forgot to mention it, but I feel as if it's common sense. \n\nJust for the record: I don't blame the employees- I know they are only doing as instructed. I blame Starbucks HQ for being stingy with their coffee. As much as they are charging, they should be willing to be a little more accommodating.",

  "text": "Bacchanal Wine is one of my new favorite spots in New Orleans! Some friends and I recently spent an entire afternoon here and had the best time. We started by entering through the wine shop, and choosing a lovely bottle of rosé. We then exited through the back of the shop into the outdoor courtyard. There's plenty of seating, and they have ice buckets and ice for your wine. There's also a stage and live music, so you know it's a great time! \n\nWe ordered the Pickled Vegetables, Gulf Shrimp, Bacon-Wrapped Dates, and created our own charcuterie board by choosing meats and cheeses from inside the wine shop that they cut and prepared for us along with bread. Everything was wonderful! And they actually gave us a ton of bread with our meats and cheeses, which I am such a fan of! I cannot stand a charcuterie with tons of meats and cheeses and then two slices of bread. So, thank you for that Bacchanal Wine! \n\nWe sat outside listening to music and drinking wine long enough to make it through two bottles, but then it started to rain. Luckily, they have an upstairs bar area that's indoors. We were lucky enough to grab a table and some cocktails to continue our conversation. I tried the Bumfuzzle which was a bourbon cocktail, as well as the Violet Spritz which was blueberry and vodka. Both were delicious! \n\nI so enjoyed my time spent at Bacchanal Wine and I hope to make it back really soon. I highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a leisurely (and tasty, and entertaining) afternoon or evening.",

This is a B.Y.O.B and there is a beer distributor next door and a Shop-rite not too far down the strip mall that now sells beer and wine, incase you forget to bring wine or you randomly decide to go there for dinner. \n\nThis place opened up about 6 months ago and I did get a menu in the mail but always forgot about it when playing the whats for dinner game. After running errands in the same location, I suggested trying this place out. I'm sad we did not try it sooner. They only have booths and tables, there is NO hibachi grill or show. \n\nWe were greeted and sat right away, by the owner who us super sweet. She asked us for our drinks as we looked over our menu. I love that they bring out a tea pot for the table. A lot of places only bring you a cup and you need to ask for refills. \n\nI decided to try the garden salad with ginger dressing and a few sushi rolls off the 50% off menu. I tried the spicy tuna roll, sweet potato roll, pumpkin tempura roll and the Boston roll, which was lettuce, mayo and fresh shrimp. Hubby got the seafood hibachi meal. You could really see and taste a difference in this food versus other places. It was very fresh and delicious. You were not rushed and they really were attentive to our table and refills on drinks. \n\nThey also offer a rewards program, where you earn credits based on your total bill. They save the amount you earned to be used next time or save it up for when you have $10 or more in credits. I believe its 5% of your total bill before taxes. \n\nI highly recommend this place!",

Here are some cool things that I discovered while at SB Certified Farmers Market:\n\nThere are clingstone and freestone peaches, flesh that clings onto the pits and freestone that just cuts open nicely without the flesh clinging to the pits.  \n\nDid you know that pink blueberries exists?  Yeah, they're light pink in color, taste is subtle but it's definitely a smaller and cuter version of the blueberry.\n\nArtichokes flower if they're not cut.  Yeah, it's pretty cool and you can use it as decorative center pieces.  \n\nThe green onions have big onion bulbs that they grow out of.  I didn't know that!  At the supermarkets, the onion bottoms are pretty tiny.  \n\nPistachio nuts were also in abundance, so if you're feeling nutty, you can purchase your own baby tree to start it off.  \n\nIt's a beautiful market, filled with flowers, fruits, plants and vegetable shown at it's rawest stage.  Vendors will advertise 4 square for credit card usage just in case cash  is not convenient for you.\n\nSince we were visiting, I bought myself a jar of tapenade, bagful of roasted peanuts to take home with us.  This beautiful 80+ degree weather during the the 4th of July weekend can only allow you to buy so much.",

That's the 4 P's you should look for anywhere you go in life.  Ok, maybe that's extreme, but it checks all the boxes for a great outdoor activity.\n\nAlthough the visitor center was closed due to COVID Precautions, there was still plenty to see and do.  There's an exhibit with a bunch of birds and information about such birds.  There was a bald eagle which is always fun to see and he didn't seem to mind the name calling.\n\nThere's a pretty nice hike that is part easy to walk and part somewhat wet and flooded over in areas, so I'd recommend hiking boots if you plan on venturing past the small inner loop areas.  There was so much wildlife, even wild parrots (not the 80's hair band, but actual parrots).  I wish they'd take care of some of the pathways where flooding happens as you may get stuck having to turn around.\n\nThere was a volunteer handing out some cool cloth masks with the St. Petersburg logo sewn in.  Pretty sweet deal.  The take donations so have some singles ready if you go.\n\nIf you're looking for an awesome way to kill a few hours and experience nature, then this is definitely a go-to place.

Food is kinda pricey but hey you're paying for some fresh and quality seafood with a great view am I right? \n\nThe steamed clams in wine sauce are just divine...I got them twice. The oysters are amazing as ever- SO fresh and tasty! The clam chowder's a nice side to have but it runs you about $5 for a small cup so it is quite expensive, but definitely nice to try at least once. Lots of clam meat and the soup had such a bold seafood flavor! If you can't already tell..I'm a total clam hoe \n\nSeating is inside or outside but I definitely prefer the outside for the amazing views of the ocean. Just watch out for the seagulls cause they're fearless and I almost got attacked for my food..it was pretty scary. Other than that this is a great spot to get food on the wharf and the wharf itself is a must-see spot when in SB. There's free parking for the first 90 minutes and like $2 after that.

Not only with the insanely gorgeous space that showcases impeccable attention to detail and so many stunning ways to honor and highlight the culture... in the decor, market goods and dish-ware, but with the food too. And I haven't even tried half of the traditional Lebanese offerings! \n\n I'm going to go bold here and say Suraya dishes up the best falafel I've ever had...and I've eaten falafel in the Middle East! It's pretty darn fantastic!! Unbelievable, actually. Crispy fried golden exterior, perfect warm interior. Perfect crunch to soft ratio. So incredibly delish! If you want to save the carbs or just eat a smidge lighter, go for the balls themselves, and not the platter. Not listed, just ask! \n\nTo date, I've tried two of their hummus flavors... the mushroom and the crispy chickpea. They're both uber creamy, totally flavorful, loaded with toppings, and just excellent. Up there as my second favorite hummus in ALL of Philly! \n\nI've also tried their baba ganoush complete with pomegranate seeds! What a lovely, crunchy, colorful addition to the dish. This smoked eggplant dip has just the right amount of smokiness and garlic! Great texture too! \n\nTheir rosewater lemonade is just beautiful and refreshing. I absolutely love it! Tart and sweet. A must! \n\nThe clementine ginger beer with cardamom served in a copper mule mug is also fantastic! \n\nThe beet salad, and Man'oushe (Lebanse flatbread) are up for me next! Oh, and the tehina hot chocolate! Yessss!! \n\nMake sure to leave some time to walk around the entire space. It's just gorgeous! The cafe is super sweet with fresh deep jewel tone blooms on each table and bright light shining through the big windows. The bar is gorgeous and inviting. The dining room is spacious and candle-lit, and the back porch will transport you to another country!! I can't wait until it's officially open back there! I'm in love with the patterned pillows, wrap around bench, wood-burning fireplace and tiled floor!! Oh, and definitely take a peek at the goods for sale. Most of them, if not all, are straight from Lebanon. Spices, oils, body goods, and textiles too! It's like perusing a shuk! \n\nThe only things that bum me out are the fact that they're closed on Mondays. There have been several, several Mondays I've wanted to go. Also, the fact that they don't take ressies for brunch. I really wanted to bring my mom and our fam here for Mother's Day. Perhaps a dinner soon will be better? Those cocktails and even the Lebanese beer are calling my name. I hear Open Table is starting to accept reservations for that time frame!\n\nI cannot say enough good things about Suraya!! It's such a pleasure for all the senses to dine here. I'm so in love! I heard 'Suraya' is the name of the owner's grandmother. They are certainly making her proud. \n\nI honestly can't see me ever tiring of this gem! It's really worthy of all of the hype it's receiving!\n\n*There's street parking which is easy to find during the day, but also an entire lot across the street!",

They always send out coupons, which are a must for us to be able to afford them. They are also a bit slow. It takes maybe 15-20 minutes for the pizza to arrive to your table. And be sure to plan ahead if doing delivery or carry-out. We have waited 1.5 hours to get our delivery. Also be careful using their online ordering system. We completed an order once for carry out at their Meridian Location and when we went to pick it up...they didn't have our order in their system and said that online ordering wasn't even an option for their location? Totally could have been user error...but I don't know. Lastly, we tried to use their Yelp Check-In deal (20% off when you check-in on Yelp!), but after waiting through 2 employees who had no idea what to do, we couldn't wait any longer and had to leave without our discount.

  "text": "Great hidden treasure in the Riverside Heights area of Tampa. Garagiste is located down a small brick paved alley between Hidden Springs Brewery and Foundation Coffee (but the building itself is located on Florida Ave). It's a small meadery but there are plenty of places to sit, including a small kids table with crayons if you want to bring your family! There is not a designated parking lot, but my best advice would be to park on the street if you can find a spot or park in the Hidden Springs lot (free) and stop there too!! \n\nThe meads here are absolutely delicious and priced so as to not break your bank. They average around 14% ABV, run about $6-$7 per pour and Garagiste serves a nice portion in a wine glass. I enjoyed the Reboog Razz (Raspberry PB&J) which was SPOT ON. So much flavor and utterly sippable. I also tried a couple of others that my friends ordered and the flavors were on points. The beertenders are freaking awesome and clearly love what they do! This is a must stop for any beer lover or anyone who isn't sure if they like beer yet...you probably will after trying these meads. They sell some chips and other snacks, but you are welcome to bring your own food here to enjoy (Hall on Franklin and Armature Works are within walking distance). Garagiste has grown substantially in popularity for beer connoisseurs so if they have a bottle release, you may want to visit on another day. I can't wait to go back :)",

  "text": "A new favorite spot in South Jersey!\n\nMy husband and I have dined at Valente's a few times now and always look forward to our return visit. Love how they keep a few fan favorites on the menu but also update the menu with seasonal ingredients and dishes.\n\nThey have two main dining options: \"High Top\" and \"Standard.\" High Top is seating in the kitchen where you can enjoy watching the kitchen staff preparing the dishes/working in action. It is also a quieter spot if you want to have some \"privacy\" or quiet setting. \"Standard\" is the Main Dining Room which has a lively atmosphere. Outdoor Seating is also available on the courtyard in front of the restaurant.\n\nIn addition to the a la carte menu, they offer a Chef's Tasting Menu (Reservations Made in Advance), which we have not done yet but that is next on our \"to-do\" list.\n\nExcellent Service. Food ingredients are top notch. Dishes are composed with great flavors and textures.\n\nBYOB. Public Parking/Street Parking.\nReservations made on OpenTable.",

  "text": "As an adult with a disability who also happens to be a homeowner, I thrive on being as independent as humanly possible. That said, I've learned the hard way that certain tasks are beyond my ability and mowing my nearly 1/2 acre lawn happens to be one of them. \n\nTrust me, I've tried. I've tried with a push mower. I'm already without feet and I had this weird feeling if I kept going that I'd eventually lose 1-2 more limbs. \n\nI tried with an old school manual-type mower. I broke it in one humiliating and failed attempt at mowing my lawn. \n\nI haven't  tried it with a riding mower because, well, most require that you actually have feet to use the gas. \n\nI've gotten by through the generosity of friends and church members, though as I get older so do they and in the last couple of years it has become increasingly hard to track down folks who want to come over on a regular basis and mow my lawn. \n\nLast year, it got ugly. I think most of my friends were torn between \"I'm tired of mowing Richard's lawn\" and \"I don't quite want to ask him to pay me to mow his lawn.\" So, the lawn got really, REALLY long before one dear neighbor complained (sarcasm noted) and my dear friends at the city served notice that perhaps I ought to mow it before it got taller than the house. Fortunately, in a critical pinch I had some friends come over and rescue me from the situation before it turned into an overly negative situation, but it finally made me look at how I'd been living from week-to-week in terms of lawn care for far too long.\n\nSo, I set out to find someone who was honest, fair, reasonably priced and conscientious. \n\nEnter Larry Poe and HALL Services. The \"HALL\" stands for Handyman and Lawn Landscape Services. I used Thumbtack to put out for bids to mow my lawn and received several responses. The prices ranged from \"so cheap that I don't trust the quality\" to \"beyond my reach.\" Poe was pretty much in the middle. I directly responded to three and found myself impressed with Poe's honesty, thoughtfulness, reasonable price and willingness to give a fairly clear schedule. \n\nI've now used HALL and Larry Poe for the entire mowing season and I've been consistently happy. From what I can gather, it's a small operation and he primarily focuses on the Eastside of Central Indiana but will consider other areas in the right situation. From what I've seen, he is careful to not overly commit himself and won't take a job he can't fulfill to the utmost quality. I happen to live in practically a perfect area for him to serve. \n\nHALL doesn't necessarily have all the razzle dazzle equipment of some companies, but what he offers in personalized service more than makes up for it. I received a timely quote, follow up on that quote, an agreed upon day with an awareness that it may flex from time to time, and a way to contact him with any concerns. He prefers to submit billing via e-mail, but will also invoice monthly. He does not ask for and actually will not do long-term contracts. He accepts payment by cash, checks and Paypal and from what I've seen typically bills within 24-48 hours of the last agreed upon service for the month. We agreed that my lawn would be mowed every other week. During one week, he missed due to some personal issues BUT he followed up with those impacted and explained everything and explained how he would be addressing it. Personally? I thought it was perfect and conscientious. \n\nThe quality has been stellar on a consistent basis. I've never questioned if he would arrive and I've never seen a finished job and thought \"I wish he would have done this.\" In fact, there's been more than once I thought \"He did more than I expected\" in terms of trimming, etc. \n\nI've only actually met him in person once this season and found him to be friendly and helpful. He also offers, as you might guess, handyman services ranging from fencing, decks, Christmas light installation and other services. From his website, it notes that he tends to avoid roofing type work. While I haven't used him for handyman type work so far, given how happy I've been with his care of my lawn I'm already considering other possible jobs. \n\nIf you really want to hire someone trustworthy, local, truly indie and who does quality work I'd definitely recommend Larry Poe and HALL Services.",

  "text": "Have you ever heard the old story about the moron who tries to stick up a tavern filled with off-duty cops?  Pretty sure I witnessed the Yelp equivalent of that colossal screw-up last night...except we were \"under cover\" because a good Yelper never throws around the Yelp name in an attempt to influence an establishment. \n\nI was dining with a large group of fellow Yelpers and had what was literally the second-worst experience in my STL dining career.  The owner made an unreasonable demand of us (one that most likely would have inspired us to not come to his establishment) pertaining to meal selections; fed us a line of BS about guacamole costing twice as much as the price on the menu due to an increase in the cost of avocados that clearly hasn't manifest itself in the grocery stores; and then berated us after he most likely instructed the kitchen to make the food for everyone else in the restaurant before ours.  He actually had the audacity to show up at our table just to make an \"I told you so\" comment that painted him as a complete ass in the minds of all present.  He also wanted to argue with those at the table who tried to offer their thoughts on the experience and had the balls to suggest some of us could go back and help out in the kitchen if we didn't appreciate the fact that the meals for our table trickled out over a period of about an hour. \n\nGuess what, pal...you picked the wrong crowd to screw with!  \n\nAbout the food:\n\nBest bite of the night was the chicken croquette that Mark P shared. I wished I had ordered a plate of those as an appetizer because they would have made a great side dish. Explanation for those not in attendance: the appetizers showed up with the entrees. \n\nWorst bite was most certainly the carne asada.  The meat was horribly tough and over cooked. The minuscule amount of chimichurri in the cheezy little plastic thimble was a complete afterthought and tasted like it was out of a can.  Given your Caribbean/Spanish theme, I would have expected the chimichurri to have been something spectacular instead of an afterthought. \n\nThe Ropa viejas was uninspired as well. The meat was supposed to be shredded but there were so many large clumps that it was obvious they took some serious shortcuts in the kitchen. The soffrito was severely lacking in the dish as well and that lead to the overall impression of blandness. \n\nNote on their cocktails: we arrived early and ordered drinks. I observed the bartender mixing up frozen concentrated juice as he worked on my drink. If you're going to serve a $10 cocktail that includes fruit juice, you damn well should take more pride in it than using frozen concentrate communicates to your patrons. \n\nNote on the service: adding a mandatory gratuity for a large party does not excuse you from the basics of taking care of a table of GUESTS in your establishment. There was no excuse for bringing someone the wrong drink, putting sugar on the rim of someone else's margarita instead of salt, forgetting included side dishes, failing to take drink orders, ignoring appetizer orders, hiding from your customers instead of paying attention to them, allowing the pitchers of water on the table to run dry or any of a myriad of other shortcomings I witnessed. \n\nReally the only high point of the evening was the company of some of my Yelp friends. I always thoroughly enjoy hanging out with you folks!\n\nDinner for two that took over 3 hours, mediocre food and a bill for about $60 all adds up to OH, HELL NO!!!",

  "text": "Fun times with fun people.\n\nHave you seen the short, bright green buses around town that says \"Indy Brew Bus\"? You can choose an excursion based on starting area and check out four different breweries. Yes, the bus is no frills (we saw other buses that looked a bit more swanky), but at $30 a trip, it is well worth it. Also, it is locally owned and operated and was the first brew bus in Indy. Support local!\n\nWe did the Broad Ripple bus, which hit Bier Brewery and Tap Room, Indiana City Brewing Co. Metazoa Brewing Company, and Centerpoint Brewery. The bus basically goes to the furthest brewery and works its way back, so if the first and second legs of the trip seem long, don't worry, it gets shorter as you move onwards. \n\nYou can see my reviews for the actual breweries on their Yelp pages. \n\n35 minutes at each brewery is a little short. It worked pretty well if there wasn't a line to get beer, but at Metazoa, since it was busy with regular patrons, we basically got our beer and then had to shoot it, because it was time to leave. You can bring beer back on the bus with you, but we got a flight (can't take the glass flight glasses) and we didn't want to take the time to transfer it to plastic cups. Most of the time I ended up drinking part of my beer at the brewery and then the rest on the bus going to the next brewery. I noticed a lot of other people were doing this too.\n\nJust a heads up, four beers in three hours plus samples may not seem like a lot, but it was enough to get us pretty buzzed (and by pretty buzzed one of my friends says she hasn't been that drunk in a while). I sat out drinking at one brewery, which saved me. \n\nMy favorite brewery just in terms of experience was Metazoa. I was predisposed not to like the place, because I'm not a fan of dogs - I'm a monster, I know - but they really made our day when they had us play flip cup. I've never seen a group of adults be more excited to relive their college days (no judgment, I loved it too). \n\nOur bus driver was fantastic. Being three beers deep I expressed my frustration to him at Metazoa that we were rushed to drink our beers. He gave us ten more minutes at the fourth stop after that. He seriously didn't have to do that, but I'm really glad he did. \n\nThis was such a fun way to experience part of the Indy brewery scene. I would highly recommend it.",

  "text": "Modesto is my hands-down favorite restaurant in St. Louis. It's a warmly hip, high-spirited eatery that is a far cry from the typical Italian sleepers that have long defined \"The Hill\".  It's somewhere you can go for a big girls night or conversely, come for a catch-up dinner with friends you haven't seen in years. Every year since they opened in 2001, I meet my high-school best friend and her husband as they visit from Boston over the holidays. One year I made the mistake of 'changing it up' by selecting a Pan-Asian restaurant and I deservedly heard about my error until the next year. Never again.\n\nI live for tapas and sangria, so it's no surprise that I try the most highly-recommended Spanish restaurant in any city I visit or have lived in. From NYC to DC, to Miami to L.A., to Boston to Chicago, I have not tried a better sangria than Modesto's. It's authentically-crafted with Brandy and simmered with sugar before cooling. It's pricey at $24/pitcher, but worth the praise you'll receive for suggesting it as well as the laughs that will soon ensue.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with the food. While the paellas are fantastic, the small plates are just more fun. The smoked trout with Serrano bacon and lemon is delicious, and the grilled baby octopus with fried potatoes and the sherry vinaigrette is stellar. The grilled lamb skewers are to-die-for and the Serrano ham cups with avocado, goat cheese and basil with a beet vinaigrette is another can't-miss.\n\nDon't take my word for it, you better show up before I drink them dry of that sangria.",

  "text": "Well, what can I tell you that hasn't already been said?  I have visited twice on a Saturday late morning after visiting the farmer's market downtown.\n\nUpon first visit, I only visited the market with food.  i picked out a small batch of sausage and cheese homemade raviolis (for the hubby), an Italian breadstick, some biscotti, a couple of apricot filled cookies, a cinnamon babka!, a meat stick (for the hubby), a couple of cheeses (one happens to be my favorite triple cream brie), a block of parmesan, a honey clover gouda and......that might have been all.  WOW what a variety of things.\n\nIt can be a little daunting at first, so many little nooks and crannies, make sure you look in them all.\n\nThe wine and cheese room is large, I haven't been through all the wines, but I have looked through all the cheeses....\nI haven't been through all the desserts but I am in love with the walnut/cinnamon biscotti and apricot filled cookies.\nI haven't tried any other bread but the Italian stick and it's the best bread on the planet! (Italian bread, that is)...\nI didn't yet try any of their pastas, but I heard it was fantastic!\n\nI have not yet checked out their sandwich counter, the meat counter or their produce but the pricing on the produce is a bit high.\n\nThis place has it all.  Pricing really isn't too high on most goods.\n\nSpeaking of goods.....the other building, the home goods....WHAT A FABULOUS PLACE FOR GIFTS (FOR YOURSELF!).  It has some of the cutest things, everything from your own pasta cutters, bowls, whisks, kitchen towels, measuring stuff, dish ware, BBQ stuff, cards, candles, cheeseboards, utensils of EVERY sort....and guess what - they are ALL very reasonably priced.  Check it!\n\nI will definitely be back.  I would not make a trip strictly there, but whenever I am in the area, it will be a MUST STOP THERE on my way home!!!  Great place.",

Hands down this place is top rate. \n\nOk so I didn't say anything about the prices, but you know what to expect, it's Mercedes Benz.  ANYWHO...\n\nAlthough I can hardly ever catch my service advisor at her desk on the moment I call, Jessica normally returns the call before the day ends. And when she calls back, I'm receiving answers to my questions & queries of ways she can help. \n\nI love the new uniforms the staff wear, very modern & classy. \n\nCurb side service & addressing you by your name as you exit the car, I mean really, who wouldnt like this attention. Assistance with transferring your belongings to the loaner vehicle... Yes & yes. Having an Enterprise rental facility on-hand makes for a plus in my mind. Normally they can get you back in a Benz, but sometimes they can't, but the loaner is normally another premium/luxury vehicle. \n\nAll in all, I'm totally satisfied with this business && if you have a Mercedes, I recommend this facility.",

  "text": "Dos Amores (Two Loves) Mexican Cuisine is a strictly take out stall in the Village of Newtown Farmers Market. Along with the rest of the shops it is only open Thursday through Saturday, so there is only a small window for getting in/out with a good sampling of their south of the border offerings. Most are of the self contained variety, like enchiladas, quesadillas, empanadas and chile rellenos, that can be prepared in advance, kept cool and then heated at home in the microwave or oven. You can also eat in the market within the common dining area at the back of the store. \n\nThat is what I did. I ordered beef and chicken empanadas, and asked them to be heated for consumption in the market. That took all of 3 minutes. They were handed to me in a paper boat with small containers of salsa and sour cream. Other sides were available, but as it was my first dive into their delectables, I opted to forego any additions. \n\nBoth empanadas were very good. The dough was crisp and strong enough to stay together as I bit through them. The chicken and ground beef were both nicely spiced, and I was also able to pour more salsa inside through the bite hole, and keep it contained until next munch. The beef was cooked with more chili powder, and had a warmer profile than the chicken. Still, I enjoyed them both for their freshness and authenticity. Like everything else in this market, prices are high. You pay the same as if you were dining in a full service restaurant. \n\nThe atmosphere of the farmers market is entertaining with all the Amish/Mennonite vendors dressed in their traditional garb and speaking colloquially. That is certainly worth the premium paid, as it is the only place in town where there is a real cultural exchange. Admittedly, Dos Amores lacks the Pennsylvania Dutch accent, but their Spanish makes up for that. \n\nI really should come here more often just to step away from modern times for a little while and enjoy all the interesting grub.",

I was...\n\nFirst visit was for a casual, lighter lunch with my daughters and an old girlfriend which it was just perfect for! We did make ressies on Open Table which wasn't necessary for a mid week lunch, but I would suggested for dinner. \n\nWhile we stuck to some basics, they were pretty great! California, California with real crab made crispy, cucumber roll, peanut avocado (the kids' favorite!), seaweed salad, edamame, and incredible Brussels! Must order! Everything was super fresh and came out in a timely fashion. \n\nService was fantastic! \nPrices were fair. \n\nI can't wait for my next visit perhaps for date night when I can taste some of those delicious sounding cocktails and dig into some entrees. \n\nI love having Tuna Bar as a new option in the Old City area just a bit away from the hustle and bustle, whether that be for lunch, happy hour (which sounded really great!), or dinner...with the kiddos, or without. It will be be on my radar for the next First Friday or after a movie at The Ritz!\n\nI actually found it a tad difficult to spot from the street. It's the door just to the left of United Blue. Not a huge sign. It's there, trust me :) \n\n*Limited kiosk meter parking.",

While I didn't grab any food from this adorable little cafe, I sampled many a beverage and took in the overall ambiance of the place as the day rolled on! \n\nIf it's a gorgeous day, grab a seat on the patio. The shady trees and variety of seating makes it a lovely place to sit and enjoy your latte. Be aware, though, the street can get super loud with multiple buses coming through! Inside, Henry's (at least in the morning hours) is like a library. So. Quiet. As in so quiet I felt like I was being too loud. But that's neither here nor there. \n\nAs for the drinks, I was quite fond of my hazelnut latte. It was made with the right amount of foam and neither too sweet or too dull. A lovely way to start the day, if I do say so. Both prices and staff were friendly and I have no doubt I could wedge myself into a corner and get a ton of work done.",

Not too many guys say that but we'll stay on the subject of hoagies!\n\nIf you sell something for over 35 years and survive you've gotta be doing something right.\n\n4 1/2 stars influenced a coworker and I to visit this postage stamp sized place for lunch this week.  It's off the beaten track about two minutes from Lancaster Ave. Street parking was easy and a breath of fresh air.  No meters!\n\nWonderful aromas were spilling out the door as we walked in.  All the usual hoagie suspects were there including hot roast pork or roast beef.  Hoagies come in either 6\" inch or 12' sizes and that is very much appreciated.  Sometimes when I'm working and need a quick lunch I don't need a sandwich that will feed a family of five for a month.  So I ordered the 6\" Italian.\n\nI was stunned by what happened next.  The lady that was making my sandwich proceeded to cut all my meats TO ORDER!  I'm so used to seeing them pulled off a pre-cut stack I think my mouth dropped open.  Now that is FRESH!\n\nI grabbed my sandwich and a can of soda from the cooler, paid about $7 total and headed back to the office.  \n\nAs you can see from my pic is was a fine looking sandwich and tasted damm good. Even better I could actually finish it without needing an afternoon nap, So for lunch, 6\" really was better than 12\"!",

But man, they have always taken forever to deliver. Granted we may be a bit far for them, but they never objected so I figure it must be acceptable.\n\nE really likes this place and he always hates on Chinese food when that's what I want. Which is often. He gets the lo mein and is always pleased by how non-greasy and fresh it is. They also put in a ton of veggies. I have gotten the general tso (probably would have been better hot and fresh instead of 90 minutes old and a bit soggy) and the sweet and sour chicken (really good!) dinner combos. The fried rice is also fresh and tasty, not oddly yellow and hard like some places, and prepared sans onion as requested.\n\nDon't get the popcorn chicken app. It has cinnamon sprinkled all over it. Don't ask me why, but it wasn't good at all. The dumplings were decent and seemed house made, but the filling was a little on the mushy side. Good dipping sauce. Also greatly enjoyed the bang bang wings.\n\nMy only beef with them, other than the delivery issue, is that they don't have hot and sour soup on the menu.

As those know, construction has been impacting businesses along the corridor.  So that was why we decided to stop for lunch today and support the restaurant.\n\nI didn't know anything going in except the rave reviews by other fellow Yelpstas.  While I've found many reviews \"off\" comparing my personal experience since being in Indy, this case proved spot-on and left me with wanting more.\n\nMore of the personal greeting by the hostess.  More of the views and the shooting fountain from large viewing windows.  More of Laura who was by far the most incredible server I have had in.... well, probably in my entire life.  More of Mark, the General Manager, who you could tell was proud of his establishment, staff, and position- to make people feel good.  More of the most incredible cod fish tacos layered in ingredients most couldn't mimic let alone create.  More of the pool tables and shuffleboard right in the middle of the restaurant.  More of the small touches that leave a lasting impression like mouthwash in the restrooms.  I could give you more, but I want you to experience it for yourself.  \n\nI have to throw in a summary of Laura's service.  This is what every single restaurant should model if they want to create a competitive edge.  Service in Indy lacks.  Laura- you should start a consulting business on the side.\n\nShe came to our table.  Her very first sentence was \"Are you under any time constraints that i should be made aware of like catching a movie?\"  Impressive.  To even take the time to tailor the experience to my needs--- that never happens.  Laura knew her menu inside and out.  She was so passionate about each and every ingredient and how it contributed to the overall dish.  We decided to play shuffleboard.  She brought us a glass of wine to the game floor.  Another nice touch that relieved us from going back to the table.  She was prompt.  Informative about the rewards program, which by the way you get 100 points equal to $100 when you confirm your email, and applied our spend to today's total.  \n\nI can't wait to go back.  It's my place for football games.  Plenty of flat screens allow you to watch games outside of the bar area and take in a game of pool.  Top notch service and truly a solid choice whether it's with your family during an afternoon lunch, a dinner date with your mate, or a night out and drinks with friends.  The audience morphs throughout the day and night and Henry's adjusts with them.  Now I need to adjust my plans so that I'm back at Henry's sooner than later.  What an incredible experience!",

Our server was nice and the atmosphere was pleasant enough but that is where the warm fuzzies stop.\n\nI ordered steak fajitas for $18.99 and they were basically flavorless. The salsa lacked anything resembling spice and I don't think the veggies and steak were seasoned either. The sizzling platter wasn't sizzling and my food was lukewarm at best.\n\nMy husband ordered the Texas BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich for $11.99. We have been watching a lot of Diners Drive-Ins & Dives on the food network lately so this sounded really good... Unfortunately, that is where the similarity stopped. The meat was lean but was boring and I swear missing BBQ sauce! For side, my husband chose Sweet Potato Fries which tasted like they had spent the last hour under a lamp - also lukewarm.\n\nThe meal was boring...  The food lukewarm at best... And the price? $40 plus tip.",

  "text": "4.5\n\nThe folks in Donelson have been trying to tell us for a while: spend some time here. Things have changed. While natives and transplants alike were focused on this and that 'upcoming area,' Donelson slowly and surely raised its profile, added the businesses and waited for people to catch up.\n\nIt worked.\n\nA day or errands caught me in Donelson. I'd planned on eating lunch at a relatively unhealthy spot when I saw the line was long and I rebuked it!* Looking down at my tight-around-the-belly t-shirt, I reconsidered my foolish notion to eat a bunch of fattening stuff and thought that I might have a salad. Or, air. Then I thought to see what was nearby. Genius, I know. 'Nectar. Hmm, let's give it a try.' It had been on my radar for a little while but I was confused by the 'Mexican on one side, smoothies on another' thing they had going on and I put it off. That was a mistake. Y'see, some days you're in the mood for tacos. Other days you want a smoothie. Nectar just figured out that putting both under the same roof (but different spaces) just.made.sense. Points to them.\n\nI parked in front, chose the healthy side and walked in. Wow. There's an entire wall full of menu options and pre-made juices (if you want to grab and go). Since I was committing to eating healthy, I decided to slow it down and eat there (on the cafe side). Since it was hot as the dickens (thanks, climate change), I opted for a cold bowl. To my delight, I discovered that the granola was gluten-free so I ordered the Almond Brothers. Ridiculous. It was so ridiculously good. The large bowl came out cold, creamy and with the stamp of being my server's favorite. It has a base of blended almond milk, bananas, cacao, maca, protein powder, and peanut butter. Then, it's topped with granola, honey, chia seeds, pecans, MORE cacao, and bee pollen. With every spoonful I nearly broke my arm patting myself on the back with how healthy I was being -- and healthy tasted delicious!! I tried to savor the bowl but I wanted to eat it as fast as I could. Luckily, the portion was so large that despite my greed, it took me a while to get through it. To pair with my cold dish, I ordered a hot latte. Staying healthy, I went for the Golden Chai Latte, which starred a good amount of turmeric. \n\nLeaving Nectar, I was so so happy. Seriously. Like, my endorphins were activated or something. There's something to putting healthy fuel in your body. Without a doubt, if I lived closer I would be here regularly. As it is, I am figuring out a way to stop by each time I am spending time in Donelson. I need to go down that smoothie menu. Middle Tennessee folks, if you haven't been here yet, you're wasting time. You are.\n\n*Something like that.",

The assortment was delectable and the warmth of the donut was like Heaven. It was so good that it would almost melt in your mouth.\n\nThis is the kind of excited I get from Krispy Kreme.

Who would have thought I would have just randomly stumbled upon my \"happy place\" in South County!\n\nEvery time my family would go on vacation to The Smoky Mountains, we would make the 7 mile trip from Gatlinburg where we were staying to get our Krispy Kreme fix in Pigeon Forge. Think of it like this -- we drove through winding mountains, dealt with traffic and a bunch of unnecessary stop lights just to get these damn donuts! I have never gotten them outside of Gatlinburg until today. \n\nI'm very happy for finding my beloved Krispy Kremes! I did indeed spend a $1.08 on a hot, fresh out of the oven glazed donut, and I will make a 10 mile trip down I-55 South just to get my fix again very soon.",

Both came with a choice of soup or salad and we both had a good (albeit generic) fresh salad with tasty dressing.\n\nThe Ginza roll was excellent - cooked salmon, mayo, oinion and tempura flakes.

If you think that you are going to eat half now, and the other half later, well, I got bad news for you: it's not going to happen. If you want something for later, buy another sandwich. You won't regret it, these Cubano sandwiches are so good. The combination of amazing bread, well portioned ham and pork, good and plentiful Swiss cheese, and the right heating point make this sandwich an amazing dish. There are not many places in Florida that make amazing Cuban sandwiches, and this is definitively one of them. Tops for me at least.\n\nOn my first visit here, I only wanted to try the Cubano sandwich. I have tried them at other restaurants in Tampa, and Tampa had nothing on other rival cities that claim to have the best Cuban sandwich. After trying this sandwich, I have changed my mind and I must say that Tampa has a great sandwich, and MIchelle Faedo is one of two places that you need to visit. I did not try anything else, although many things looked good. I will surely come back, despite the cafeteria vibe of this place, not judging, just saying.",

The temperature was just chilly enough to sit outdoors so I was excited. Located right on Bourbon street, we walked right in and told to wait a few for our table to be ready on the roof top. When we proceeded to the third floor, the area is divided and only a few tabes are truly on the rooftop area (meaning that overlook Bourbon street) The table that they gave us was not one of those and the host explained that those were not for regular reservations only deposit reservations. Since I was not aware of any of that and they didn't clarify at the time of reservations, I pleaded for what I thought we had reserved. A rooftop table. After a little snag from the host, she finally gave us a great table at the end. Honestly I think it was fuss that could've been avoided. We were going to eat and drink, I don't get it. Anyways, away her vibe and in come our waitress for the night!\n\nCan I tell you that the vibe completely changed when our Maddie waitress took over? Wow she was great we had such a fab night. We took her recommendations for the dishes and had a fantastic first dinner in New Orleans. The music was playing, the weather was cool, the Cajun fried catfish and shrimp over penne, the mambo oysters delish! Wow my mouth is watering remembering those oysters right now. And the warm rum bread pudding? I think it had praline sauce. If you're in the area, give Mambos a shot. I recommend upstairs if you can.",

  "text": "Old Glory is a fascinating 1920's boiler room that was converted into a speakeasy. If you are wandering around the alley behind Taco Mamacita in Edgehill then you are not the only one lost (I must have walked back and forth a few times scratching my head). There is no sign letting you know that you have arrived. Go up a couple steps to a black door with a large golden triangle framing the wall around it. As you walk in, you will again wonder if this is where you think it is. If this thought enters your mind then yes, you're here! You will find yourself on a balcony where you descend a curved stairwell then be met with the scene of a cool bar area, the large boiler and a dark, moody ambiance. What is so interesting about this space is that they clearly did not change the original elements of the building but built around the features. There are a few small seating areas that are very cozy looking as well as another staircase past the bar which led up to additional seating (more spacious) on a balcony area overlooking the bar. There are few other spots I've discovered that has the same artistic quality as Old Glory. \n\nI came here for a networking event in the evening and I felt like I was squinting at people to try and see who I recognized. Give it a few minutes and your eyes will adjust. The bar area was very crowded so I waited patiently for a drink and attempted to squeeze around multiple people. I perused the specialty winter drink menu for 30 seconds then fixated my eyes on a drink called the Velvet Frost. The bartender put ice in a gimlet glass to chill it then started the artful mixing of  the elements of the drink which included gin, coconut and pineapple. This frothy, fruity drink was topped off with a spring of some type of herb. Although on the pricier side for a cocktail I thought \"when in Rome\" so I went with it. It was delicious. Later on in the evening I got a Moscow mule which was made very well (although not served in a copper cup). The drinks were worth the wait. \n\nOverall, a must-have experience for any residents of Nashville. While dive bars are more my scene it is nice to dress it up a bit and have a classier experience. The ambiance is incredible, the drinks are amazing and it is a win!",

Full-service hat cleaning is also available in store. The store manager Chuong is an expert seamstress too! She has been working with AZ Hatters for over 30 years and is highly skilled in repairs, fitting and shaping. \n\nBuying a hat is like buying anything else that should be properly fitted, like shoes, a suit, denim, etc. Arizona Hatters will not let you leave with an ill fitting hat, you can count on that! The customer service is excellent. They are super friendly and knowledgable. Arizona Hatters is where many ranchers and cowboys from Southern AZ go to purchase hats and or/get them re-blocked. Arizona Hatters started out serving ranchers with Western ware, so they know their stuff! \n\nOn our visit we got to meet and chat with the owner, Mark, and he's the nicest person.

But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate a nice ballpark when I see one.  CBP is convenient to get to from city center, has a ton of parking, clean, easy to navigate, and I don't think there's a bad seat in the place.  And the view of downtown Philly over the outfield wall, while small, is pretty spectacular.\n\nOh and the bell in the outfield that lights up and dings after each home run is totally kitchy but I loved it.",

  "text": "Portillo's is fine, but I just don't get all the hubbub surrounding this chain. Maybe someone who loves it can explain it to me, and fill me in on what I should order. Because every time I eat here, I'm always like, \"That chili dog was alright\" or \"I guess I'll just eat these fries because they're sitting here.\" I don't especially like my food, but I don't not like it -- it's just fine.\n\nThis Avon Portillo's is huge inside, with lots of seating. The dining room kind of reminds me of a restaurant that you would see in Disneyland or something: the area where you stand in line to order is big and snakes around to accommodate a large crowd. Fortunately, when we visited, it wasn't crowded at all and we were able to just step up and order right away. After you order, they call your number and you pick up your bags of food. (For some reason, they put our food in a bag even though we were dining in.)\n\nAnother thing about the dining room: The music they play in the restaurant is about three notches too loud -- it's at that annoying level where it's just loud enough to make talking and hearing difficult. This might not be a good place to sit and eat if you want to be able to carry on a conversation.",

An XL thin crust pizza (28''x9'') and 12 wings for $20.  One the pizza, we went with Italian sausage and mixed peppers, very tasty!  Love the sauce here.  It's chunky, semi-sweet and tastes amazingly fresh.\n\nAs for the wings, we went with the blackened garlic.  The wings were also great, and they're baked.  Not as crispy and delicious as fried wings, outstanding nonetheless.  Would recommend.  \n\nOn our most recent visit, we stopped in to take advantage of a free cheese pizza coupon we got in the mail.  This time, we sampled the hand-tossed pizza, and added mushrooms.  I've gotta say, it was damn good.  So good, in fact, that I ate the last two take-out slices within an hour of getting home.\n\nWe also had an Caprese salad, which was alright.  The cheese and dressing were fine, but the sad little plum tomatoes they served us were pale, not quite ripe and tasteless at best.\n\nLastly, the new decor is great.  The Tampa theme with its paintings and pictures represent our little city well.",

  "text": "I have to update my review now that the downstairs part is also open.\n\nEven though it's like a third of a floor, opening the downstairs part really makes a huge difference. Now, on the first floor, there is an area for the 3 and under crowd, a huge water table play station, and a \"sandy\" area. \n\nCan we all just agree that 3 and under should stay 3 and under? This isn't the museum's fault and it probably isn't worth the money to staff someone to watch this, but there is a young baby/toddler section so they don't get run over. My son almost got jumped on by children who looked over 5 years old in the mini ball pit. All the young children were just hanging out there barely moving and some older children came jumping. Maybe they were kids with younger siblings so the parents wanted them all in the same place, but it was in no way ideal. I'm still happy that they have this little section, I just wish it was policed more. \n\nThe \"sandy\" area is pretty neat. It's not really sand, but more like super tiny rubber pieces. You don't have to worry about your kids being covered in the stuff. The only reason we stayed out of that area is I'm sure my son would try to eat it. \n\nThe giant water table is pretty cool too. They have outfit covers for kids to wear to try to stop them from getting soaking wet, but there are few and disappear quickly. If you have a splasher it might be worth bringing your own poncho. I can say that because I have a million Yelp ponchos. \n\nOn the weekend, upstairs can be quite chaotic. The Publix is a free for all where the kids are grabbing all the goods and one museum staffer is halfheartedly trying to reshelve them. However, the other areas, although somewhat crowded, never felt overly so. \n\nIt may be that now that my son is walking I enjoyed it more because he could explore, but I definitely think for the price this place is worth five stars.",

I do not expect restaurants to serve food that will burn your face off but a zero on my scale is too low.\n\nService - You order with the cashier and pay like any fast food place.

  "text": "AJ's is definitely one of my favorite stops in Tucson! It's usually always on our trip schedule when we head down each year. \n\nAJ's opens early 6am, so it's become tradition to get there slightly after they open, enjoy some breakfast, and then browse. They have an excellent selection of baked goods and bagels, but my favorite is their hot bar. I love going for their egg concoctions and potatoes.\n\nWe will grab our noms, head to the pre-outdoor patio (usually it's already getting too hot for some of the party to eat outside). This is a more air conditioned \"outside\" seating. You will be surrounded with those doing the same; sipping coffee and munching - many doing it before work starts.\n\nThen, comes the exploring! The wine and alcohol section is one of my personal favorites. There is a vast selection, and so much to try (and just look at from afar, because the prices are REAL). On top of the alcohol, AJ's also has an exorbitant amount of specialty goods: this is specifically what AJ's is known for.  This makes it extremely fun to browse and explore. \n\nOn top of the groceries, specialty items, alcohol, hot bars, flower section, and gorgeous produce display, AJ's also offers an area catered to those looking for gifts. This ranges from clothing, candles, kitchen goods, stuffed animals, body health, etc. etc. The exploring can go on for a while. It's honestly hard to spend less than an hour here.\n\nAnother thing about AJ's is... it tends to be on the pricier side. But for goods you can't easily find elsewhere? It's worth it. \n\nIf I lived in Tucson, this would be a daily-before-work stop for me. AJ's is most definitely an Arizona gem.",

I stopped in for a late lunch and ordered from the lunch menu (General Tso's Chicken, Fried Rice, Broccoli with a bowl of Wonton Soup).\n\nThe soup was actually the strongest part of the lunch. The chicken consume base was tasty, and the wontons, although somewhat thick skinned, actually had a decent flavor, too. The general's chicken was a large mound of amber glossed bird nuggets. About half of them were the right texture and taste, while the others were either too thickly skinned, or too crunchy to enjoy. Could not always taste the meat within. The fried rice was a large helping with adequate veggies to keep it interesting. Of course, the broccoli florets were there for decoration more than consumption. \n\nThe meal was just okay overall.  I appreciated that there was a dining room where I could sit and eat lunch.  It would have been even better if they used real plates and flatware, rather than styro and plastic, and a take out container for the soup.  Service was provided by the cashier who was attractive and pleasant to all customers.  \n\nThe sign out front is worn and faded, and could use a little TLC to keep the shop from looking worse than it is. A little fresh paint and relettering would make China Chef a more upbeat place to chow down (no pun intended).",

  "text": "I've been wanting to try Bun Bo Hue, #23 here, for quite some time. Traditionally Bun Bo Hue is a spicy Viet noodle soup that has a richly flavored spicy broth with the odd cuts like tendon, tripe, flank, etc. along with cha lua (Viet meatloaf), and blood cake! I'm an adventurous eater, and all for the authenticity, but some of those things have kept me away from this for far too long. Thanks to some great photos on another social network and gentle nudging from friends, I saw that Pho, by Target, was serving a \"Spicy Noodle Soup with beef or pork\" that turned out to be their version of Bun Bo Hue, and the most approachable version that I've seen to date. \n\nWhile this soup is similar to pho, it varies in numerous ways. The broth was dark, rich, spicy, and full of flavors, very different from the clear, delicate consomme style pho broth we typically enjoy. The noodles were thicker, rounder, and had bit more chew than the thin vermicelli style in pho, and the soup included rare beef, flank, brisket, and cha lua (Viet meatloaf), which has more texture than flavor. I added in some lime juice, bean sprouts, jalapenos, basil and cilantro. The lime juice and herbs really made the soup come to life, and the bean sprouts added that much needed textural element to the dish. \n\nI will definitely be back for this dish again, and I'll be sure to try Bun Bo Hue all over thanks to Pho. But my fiance and I have ordered other dishes here, including a stir fried noodle dish with cha lua, and the veggie pho, and found them to just be ok. I have no doubt there are some other stars hiding on that menu and I'm looking forward to trying them soon. Pho has made the rotation and I'm looking forward to going back.",

WOW, that's descriptive, but true.\n\nI became a sucker to these idiots, or who's the idiot, as they are a door to door, food sales business, and I was outside talking to my neighbor when the CRACK HEADS showed. since they can't be the most reputable company, hence they hire people who look as if just released from prison, only after enjoying the beatings and occasional rape.\n\nThe CRACK HEADs work as a team of Mr. Scum and Mr. Open Sores. they gladly show you pamphlets, tell you there customers and how clean there finger nails are!\n\nOK, apparently me and the neighbor were weakened by the smell of meth and went in half for NY strip steaks. My first thought was to kill myself before the actual purchase. I regret that now. But, experiment is the name of the game. and I had a money back GAR-UN-TEE (sound hillbilly enough) as it said so on the pamphlet.\n\nI took two frozen steaks from the box and defrosted them. once defrosted I cut the plastic cryovacted seal and went to pull it out. What followed were like entrails in an autopsy. A slimy gelatinous goo, with a distinctive chemical oder. Was it formaldehyde a common preservative for lab rats, in your 7th grade biology class, or was t an embalming fluid used to prepare you for your final windowless condo? \n\nMy senses hit me like a European speed train, yes I was taken.....DEE DEE DEE, I know I should get back on the small bus.\n\nOnce realized that I was taken there were two things I had to do! One contact the pamphlet company and get my money back just as they said I would, two experiment with this alien meat (alien as in outer space, not illegally entered in the United States).\n\nI pan cooked the steak, as if I were going to make any NY strip. When done I thought it even smelled normal, but I had the smell of formaldehyde in my nostrils. So I stuck my noise in a coffee can (swear) to burn away the remnants of lab rat! \n\nThe steak still had a funny oder as if this cow had a heart attack in the field and the cow hands came by a few days later with a chain saw to butcher dear old (very old) Bessy!\n\nI had to continue, maybe the fear of a meth laced high was over whelming me, causing me not to think straight. So I needed to bite into it. I didn't even have a red wine reduction or a cream sauce on it. a cut a small piece and bit down!\n\nThe chewing began. it almost had a texture of steak, it almost had a texture of the sole of my shoe too! I chewed and chewed and chewed and chewed, then gave up and swallowed. the taste was now recognizable, SALT! and a whole lot of it. I didn't even salt it. it was as if this was a pre salted cow, I hear there all over Europe and the communists swear by them.\n\nThe gelatinous ooze was a liquid salt solution, used to preserve this disgusting piece of meat! The experiment continued. I got NY strip number two, and removed it from the use and washed off the steak. When I did that the steak instantly went grey! literally went grey. My steak was a mood ring, that was edible, well edible to a maggot!\n\nI didn't salt the washed grey looking steak and tossed it into the pan. The result was the same, except the memories of watching this steak turn grey!\n\nLastly, I called the number on the pamphlet, and it rang and rang and rang, I even walked away from the phone cleaned the living room and came back to rings. The 1-800 to know where! I then went to the internet (the greatest invention ever) and googled them! I number of similar complaints popped up! What a scum, bile eating, slime sucking company. I would like to thank Mr. Scum and Mr. Open Sore, for delivering me back to reality, I don't think they will be treated as kindly next time! \n\nPS, when I spoke to my neighbor again, he said wasn't it terrible, I gave mine to the lawn man, well neighbor, I threw mine away!!!!",

  "text": "$5 for a pint and a slice is one of the best deals in the city!!!  I would rank them higher except they have recently been inconsistent with their closing times.  This used to always be my go to place for some late night food but of late they have been closing much earlier so it is hard to judge when they may or may not be serving later at night.  They do tasty pizza, lasagna, and everything else I've had has been very good.  Not my favorite pizza in the area but at $5 for a pint and slice you are losing money if you don't eat your slice!!!",

  "text": "We went on the Steamboat Natchez tour. Tickets were pretty expensive for roughly a two hour trip. My in-laws, hubby, and I were disappointed. This is a tourist trap and is filled with adults over the age of 55. The band was not very good, the food was literally a buffet (who knows how long it had been sitting out), and the actual steamboat was older and needed some TLC. I would not take this tour again if I were in the area.",
