  "text": "I deducted one star because the service was not great. Our waiter wasn't friendly at all. The first question was \"soup or salad \". I wanted to order appetizer and lunch special, but he assumed we were having lunch. Seaweed salad was really good. Shiomay was small but good. The sashimi was fresh. Banzai roll was great and unique. Raw salmon and white fish with avocado and fish egg wrapped in cucumber with some sweet sauce. Perfect for those who is looking for no-rice roll. Salad dressing was more like carrot pur√©e.",

  "text": "I stopped at Walgreens in hopes of seeing the new ELF Villain's collection. Sometimes Walgreens gets them before the holidays. Sometimes they don't. This particular one doesn't ever get them according to their cosmetics person. SAD. Really sad. I suppose I'll have to skulk other Walgreens to find them.",

  "text": "After trying a few ramen places with crazy variety in their selections and stellar broth, I was not too excited about the ramen I got at Cheu.  Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.  \n\nThe service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one.",

  "text": "Came in after attending the Zurich Classic golf tournament. It was a warm and a bit humid so what tastier then a ice cream cone? I lucked out and found a parking space on the street. The interior is quite cute and comfy.\n\nThe selection here is crazy huge but after sampling a couple of unusual flavors I went with the scoop of cookie monster ice cream on a cone. The ice cream hit the spot and I enjoyed it BC it wasn't overly sweet.\n\nCreole Creamery was definitely worth checking out!",
