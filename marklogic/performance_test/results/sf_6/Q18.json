Treadmills have salt on them from people wearing their shoes in. I love to people watch here, but while I love to lift weights, those are a mess too! Either we need to require members to pick up after themselves, or get a cleaning crew on staff. Come on, planet fitness does better than this!",

  "text": "Pros: 24 hours entry, new equipment, dumbbells up to 150lbs, and plenty of parking. \n\nCons: \n-Waaaay too overcrowded at peak times. I'm not one to take group classes, but the rooms always seem overpacked with people \n-The place is run by children. They're all very young, and professionalism is minimal at best. I don't even scan in when I go because nobody is paying attention, and I am rarely greeted upon entry. Usually the kids are huddled around joking with one another, playing on their cell phones, or playing on the computer. \n-Next to the gym is a pizza place, a donut shop, etc. I worry that the temptation of the junk food is a lot to handle for some people, and I feel bad that they have to walk in/out of the gym with temptation surrounding them. \n-Not enough mirrors. The power racks are facing blank walls, so I can't watch my form effectively or efficiently. \n-High pressure sales for PT. Signing up for a membership was easy enough, but their PT salesmen are very aggressive. I went in for an assessment, and it was nothing more than an hour-long sales pitch. I wasn't impressed with the training staff. I'd watch them take people through sessions while I did cardio, and it seemed like everyone was getting the same workouts: TRX squats, ball slams, and ropes. I'm not paying for that, and I pity anyone who fell prey to their high-pressure sales tactics.",

  "text": "This place is awesome for a beginner gym. Tons of machines for every part of your body and tons of cardio equipment ranging from ellipticals, treadmills, arc trainers and stair masters. They have rooms designed for specific workouts and access to free trainers to show you workouts to do. All of that for 10 bucks?! How could you beat that? And it's opened 24 hours. And for 20 bucks a month you can get the black card which will let you bring a friend anytime and also use massages beds and tanning beds. It's an awesome deal. The place is clean and the bathrooms and locker rooms are maintained. \n\nNow the staff is amazing and is what kept me coming back. They are all extremely inviting and welcoming every time I come in and actually care about you and your fitness. If you live in the area and need a gym, I would definitely recommend.  This place is managed very well and has everything a beginner needs to get in shape.",

I had my intro meeting on Monday 4/1 with Wes where he spend about 45 minutes showing me around, explaining how their classes work, etc. He broke it down and made it less intimidating to go to a new gym. I signed up for the 1 month trial membership and have already used it 2x! These work outs are HARD. Especially for a newbie, but I love the pace, it is new everyday, they have two options lean and cross fit. This is nice because it always gives options. The people are not rude, always help you out, the others that go there are welcoming as you're in and out in ONE HOUR!! They have a beautifully designed yoga room, clean bathrooms, showers, and an area for your kiddos to hang out while you work out. I hope this becomes a new lifestyle for me. So far so good!",

Because this gym is awesome!!\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nPowerhouse was already a pretty good sized gym when I started there, but after its recent expansion, it is now ENORMOUS!  \n\nI had no complaints about Powerhouse, but I did recently leave the gym after over 2 years of being a member.  I went to Harbour Island Athletic Club because of a group discount program that I was offered.  I have a feeling I will return to Powerhouse one day though, because I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.\n\nAll of the equipment is in great shape and mostly kept up nicely.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  There is a kitchen/smoothie shop inside to make it impossible to avoid eating healthy.  There is a giant staircase in the middle of the gym, representing the famous Santa Monica stairs in California.  There are many other features that you can check out on their website, but I never did the group workouts or classes so I can't say much about them.\n\nJeff Trager aka The Knot Doctor has an office located in the back of the gym, which a huge bonus for me because I have been going to him for years now.  Jeff is the man for any kind of injury that could possibly require a standard or deep tissue massage.  He is ART (Active Release Technique) certified and is the team therapist for the Yankees when they are in town for spring training or playing the Rays.  I recommend him to everyone that has any physical ailment, because he has fixed several problems for me over the years.\n\nIf you live or work in the Downtown/Channelside/Ybor/South Tampa area, I highly recommend Powerhouse Gym.",

The center has several large pools, water slides, a lazy river, climbing wall, and more.  There is also a concession stand with reasonably priced snacks and treats available.  \n\nMy friend rented one of the on-site cabanas which run around $49 on weekdays and $79 on weekends for the 8x8 size.  Trust me when I say that it's a worthwhile investment.  The cabanas offer shaded seating, locked storage, and allow you to bring in your own food.  \n\nI'm not a huge swimming pool fan (am I the only one who HATES swimsuit shopping?), but I will definitely be back at the Monon Center soon.  The water slides and lazy river are fun for kids and adults alike.  The lazy river offers some much needed relaxation, and the more adventurous members of your party are sure to enjoy the wave rider.  Just don't wipe out.  I WILL laugh at you, LOL.  This is a great outing for families or for an adult-only fun day.  There's truly something for everyone.  \n\nSurf's up!",

I was disrespected by the manager who basically scolded me like a child for walking into the womens locker room to lock my stuff.  but since he was cleaning, it was a huge problem and spoke down to me in a way that did not sit well with me.  His energy is horrible and cocky.  then, i cancelled my membership because I moved away.  I called and cancelled it in early august.  then I was wrongly charged not once but twice.  once in august and another time in september.  I called, they told me to have my stepfather come in august to sign for me and that I wouldnt ever be charged again, which was a complete lie because as I stated above, they charged me again in late sept.  I called, and the manager literally tried to yell at me and school me on \"how cancellations work\".   I have worked in gyms for years, im a yoga teacher for Equinox so i dont need to be schooled on gym memberships.  He proceeded to yell and call me by a nickname that isnt even my name.  once again, he is disrespectful, ignorant, and doesnt know how to speak to members or customers.  How does this guy even have a job? the customer service is horrible. All to not give a member $10.70 back? so ridiculous.",

  "text": "I'm officially obsessed. I joined this gym a few weeks ago after trying them out during Yelp's In It to Thin It. My old gym (Weston Fitness, see review update) had lost it's luster and began charging extra for my favourite class, so we parted ways after 2 years of having a really good thing going. It felt serious.\n\nAnyways, I never think about Weston anymore because Unite has totally swept me off my feet. The class format keeps things moving and helps you challenge yourself in manageable increments. I'm still sore after every class and constantly looking for more time in my schedule where I can squeeze in another class here and there. I can't get enough. I've done classes with Bill and Juliet and they are both incredible. I always end up dripping sweat and I'm not much of a sweaty person so that really takes a lot of effort for me. They are positive and motivational and great teachers.\n\nCan't speak to the locker facilities much because I always go home beforehand to change and then go back home afterward, but they have lockers available with locks so I don't have to schlep my padlock anymore. Love that.",

  "text": "I booked a private party at this studio as a birthday celebration and it was so much fun. Beverly, the studio manager, helped me to coordinate an afrobeat/hip dance class as the theme for the evening, and everything turned out great! Lehla, one of their dance instructors, taught the class and incorporated some zumba moves as well as some African popular and traditional dance steps. Plus, the music was poppin! They were able to incorporate my song requests too! \n\nIt was a workout (and pretty much nonstop), but it looked like my friends enjoyed themselves, and of course, I loved it! The moves were a good balance of challenging and basic, and I really felt liked I burned calories. It was quite a lot for over an hour of class, and we got there a little late (parking, ugh), which wound up cutting off about 15 minutes of dance instruction. Even still, it was a full, high-intensity class. That said, my dance theme was customized. I don't know if anyone else is as crazy as me to do the same kind of dance for a party, but just a word of warning, if you do, that it was intense. It wasn't a situation where breaks weren't allowed though and the atmosphere was relaxed.\n\nA tip to be sure to bring water. I unfortunately did not bring enough for me and my friends, and there was no access to any there. Also, the studio is one floor, and this location wasn't very large. We had about 8 people and it was a good amount of space for us to spread out, but I'm sure it'd be a wee bit tight for larger groups. We also brought a little spread of fruit, cheeses and drinks (you can bring wine or champagne). It worked out great. I would just make sure if you bring snacks for a party that they are compact, since there isn't much space. We used the studio close to closing time, which meant we had to pack all the food up quickly.",

I am certain that sticking to this plan will allow me to see results that I would not get if I just went to the gym on my own. \nI am also impressed with the staff at the Ironworks location because they have been extremely responsive to my questions or concerns. They are very prompt in returning phone calls, texts, or emails and always have a reasonable answer. \nSome of the pros with this workout include: \n- the heart monitor tracking board allows you to see how you are doing in realtime and track your heart rate and \"splat\" points\n- every day is completely different and it is very well organized \n- I feel that this is really a total body workout\n- You personalize and run your workout depending on your effort level\nA few cons:\n- It can be a little crowded in there with about 30 people. I wish the space were just a teensy bit larger.\n- The treadmills go FAST, so get there early if you want to get your run done first.\n- I would not classify it as \"personal training\" as it is advertised. I feel that all the trainers I have been trained and I trust their instruction. They are also always there if I have a question or concern. But, it is more group fitness than personal training.\n- It also has a fairy hefty cost, but I feel that it is worth it considering the type of workout.\n\nSo, overall I'm a happy OTF'er and hope you enjoy it too! There are also decent locker rooms for post-workout shower, which is important to me since I try to do the early classes before work. Just make sure you bring your own towel!",

That's not me, and that's okay because Planet Fitness has members of all shapes and sizes and fitness levels. My favorite part is that there isn't that weird, musky gym smell. The place is clean, and super organized. There's tons of thread mills, and ellipticals, and strange machines I have no idea how to use. Not to mention tanning booths. \n\nI joined while they had their promo going which only cost me $1 to join and the monthly fee is $10. If you're home visiting from college or are even here for a couple weeks it's totally worth joining since it's considerably cheaper than most gym's guest passes. If you live you're life on a crazy schedule, this place is for you. It's open 24/7 Monday-Friday and has decent hours on the weekends. \n\nThere's a strict no grunting policy which I love. I just don't understand how grunting \"rawwrwww\" or \"uuuhhhhg\" will help anyone lift more weight but what do I know, I hate going to the gym! The best part is the lunk alarm. Every so often someone drops a weight which in itself can be embarrassing. At Planet Fitness an alarm sounds. So if you find yourself dropping a weight, just take a bow because you'll have a whole audience gawking at you.",

Today, the stench was so bad it made its way into the workout area.  I hate to drive the extra distance, but I need to be able to breathe when I workout.  My rating is based on comparing to other LA Fitness locations around Indy and in Waukegan, IL.  This one is the only bad one I have experienced.",

Your suppose to remember to cancel your membership in five months so as not to incur an xtra mont of fee, because at the end they don't remind you, your contracts up, rather the extend it month to month automatically, without any notification to remind you of this consequence. There for you always pay for that xtra month, just sucks.",

  "text": "I was a multi-site member of Idaho Athletic Club from 2008 to January 2017, when the clubs were sold to Crunch Fitness.  There are promises of new equipment and renovations.  Currently, has the appearance of a club in rapid decline. Each day, there are fewer pieces of \"working\" equipment available.  For years, the Eagle club was pristine under Jody's care, but Jody is gone. The women's locker room is closed for 45 minutes daily for cleaning, but after the \"cleaning\" time trash cans are overflowing and the bathroom are remains trashed.  I plan to load before and after \"cleaning\" pictures of a toilet area.  The management provides toilet tissue that shreds as it leaves the dispenser, thus the TP pieces on the floor. There is no sanitary disposal bin in this stall.\nWhy do I continue with Crunch?  I have an excellent Personal Trainer who I work with twice a week for many years.\nI used to attend and recommend the Water Aerobics classes to clients with weight, orthopedic, and arthritis issues, but it appears Crunch has abandoned this program.\nI am not giving up yet, but am progressively losing my optimism. \nSo my advise: buyer beware.",

Liz was very helpful and friendly, she is one of the coachs as well. She explained how this awesome guided cross-training works:\n- The workout is not too complicated, a combination of cardio( 30 min), strength(30 min) and stretching(15 min). 75 minutes  and your( and my) guts to get the job done.\n- Classes has limited spots and reservations are required via an app and subject to availability.\n- $10 fee for no show or late cancellations, as you are taking somebody's else spot. \n- Personal coaching & an intense boot camp are available. \n- Towels are available for $1.\n\nAs a first time client, I was eligible for one free trial workout in the group cross-training program, and I took it with Evan, even though I already bought my package yesterday. \nHere is my brief observations:\n- Evan was awesome, and very patient with my newly discovered \"workout dyslexia!\"\n- The space is clean and well-maintained.\n- Yoga mats and weights ( of course) are provided.\n- ALL coaches are HOT!

The swimming pool looks great, and the restaurant has amazing sandwiches. Oh, and it's open 24/7. Steal. \n\nThough I must say that the peak hours at the gym is pretty frustrating, which happens in every gym I'm sure. Weekdays 5pm-7pm is usually pretty busy with the younger crowds, Fridays is not bad at all after 5pm most of the time, and for weekends, late morning is busy with most elderly members.\n\nThey have finally increased the size of the parking lot, kudos to that! Overall it is a decent gym, not modern or brand new like LA Fitness etc, the price of the membership is decent for the facilities they offer. \n\nThe only bad thing I'd comment would be the certain crowd of people that may be annoying and loud at times, there are still people under the age of 18 using the gym, which is very inconvenient (staffs need to keep an eye for these people) and the weights machines are not being maintained sometimes.",

The equipment was in rougher shape compared to other boxes but the humidity and weather take a toll on metal equipment. \nOverall, this box has an awesome community feel with a wide variety of class offerings throughout the day.

But once you step in to the sauna, toilet or shower area, you are in for a disgusting experience.  \n\nThe sauna floor is uneven and there is a hole that is covered by a rubber mat.  There are slats missing on the seats such that you can see the absolute filth that is on the floor under the seats.  Exposed nail heads add to the appearance.  It often smells in there so badly.  \n\nThe toilet and sink area is always gross.  It smells from lack of ventilation and there seems to always be toilet paper and paper towels strewn all about the floor.  The sinks are often clogged and the sink counter is always wet.  \n\nThen we have the showers.  Drain flies.   There are dead flies stuck to the ceiling and often a few live ones around.  The filth that these pigs leave in the shower area is sometimes there for a few days- empty soap wrappers, paper towels, etc. \n\nIt's rare to be in the sauna when there is not some self-centered, ill-mannered fool blasting his music, doing exercises in your face or, believe it or not, talking on his phone at the top of his lungs.  No class.  And, of course, no rules are enforced by stuff because the staff doesn't seem to care about the experience.  \n\nSeriously there are a few a-holes who answer their phones while in the shower and talk at the top of their lungs.   Call me crazy, but I think the sauna and the shower should be pretty relaxing places and not places where I am subject to the idiotic conversations of self-centered low class guys.\n\nPlease join me in calling the Montgomery County Board of Health if you experience filth.

There is a gated water area for toddlers.  Having this area blocked off is a great idea.  There is a snack bar on the property but I saw others with small coolers.  Admission is $8 for adults and $5 for children.  You can stay all day.  I am not sure about passes out.  The lazy river and water slides were alot of fun.  It's a great place for parents to interact with their children.  Can't wait to go again!",

(Can't get parts is the standard reply).\nI originally wanted to join because of the pool. They had good \"open swim\" times that worked for my schedule. About 1 1/2 years ago they started a Master Swim program that locked out the regulars 4 mornings a week. They also do not enforce the \"no children\" rule when the pool is open to members. \nTop that off with their extremely high dues and the place is no longer for me.",

  "text": "Why come here?\n\n1) $16 dollars a month ($10 to start IRC)\nMost gyms have monthly plans from $40-60. Other than an extra fee a few months into it, this is the most economical gym membership you can get. Technically, the USF gym is cheaper but I m not enrolling in class again there just for the gym lol.\n\nI''ll be honest. I've tried other gyms close by like the old Gold Gym in City Plaza or Lifestyle Gym on Amberly (That one changes identities more than most folks change clothes. IIRC it's Captain Crunch now?). The problem with those places was lack of cardiovascular  machines. A lot of people would socialize there and hog the machines. Lame. (Also my wallet was stolen there many years ago and they were very apathetic and unhelpful in retrieving it)\n\n2) Youfit has a boatload of treadmills,stationary bikes,ellipticals, and steppers. It's rare that one would ever have to wait for one. \nAs you enter , there are cardiovascular machines on the left , weight machines in the middle, and \"free weights\" on the right. There is a group exercise room towards the left side that has been added in the time that I've joined(I haven't taken any classes there so I cant comment on them. Melony R's review goes into detail)\n\n3) Another thing I like is that there are multiple hand towels/sanitizer stations around. I've only used the bathrooms a handful of times but they were mostly clean when I did. \n\n4) This is purely subjective, but as a comic book fan, I love the purple/green motif inside. Joker, Green Goblin, and Devastator would LOVE it here!\n5) They are open during many national holidays (at reduced hours) \n\nSince this branch is close to USF, its mostly populated by a diverse crowd. . Regular or bigger folks attend without worry about feeling out of place with stylish soccer moms like those aforementioned gyms. \n\nThe only negatives would probably be the parking lot. It is shared with a Hertz rental place and MD oriental market. I have had a hubcap stolen while working out once (Jokes on them. It was a plastic Walmart one)\nWhile its not dangerous, I would use caution at night.\n\nOverall, whether youre hardcore or softcore, its a great place to work out.",

  "text": "Its a great gym, for a great price. Management is very responsive to suggestions. Clean. Great workouts. The classes are excellent as people have previously mentioned. However, they are so excellent that they are difficult to get into. There is an online sign up system that makes it easy, but sign up opens 24 hours before and the class is usually full 30 min after sign up starts. Then a dance occurs where you are constantly checking the website waiting for a spot to open up. Usually I can get a spot, but it is just a little annoying. I can't think of a better system though, other than to add more classes. Which they have been doing. \n\nFurthermore, another suggestion I have is to bring the billing in-house. It is frustrating to go into the gym with a question about the billing on your account, only to be directed to call Arizona and wait on hold. The management says that they are working on it, but it is understandably difficult.",

I have been a member of so many gyms, and unfortunately I never utilized them the way I should have. It has always been hard for me to stick with it because I wouldn't see results. I decided to give this a chance and it was the best decision I have ever made! The classes are 45 minutes to an hour long and with the absolute most supportive coaches you can imagine. They will show you what to do, correct you if need be, and help you get the results you want! You wear a monitor that breaks down your workout and what you did so you are never left questioning it. The proof is RIGHT there. I have never felt out of place, if anything I feel like I belong here more than any other establishment I have been. Coach Nina, Sherilyn, Foley, Micayla, Murphy.... All of them are so supportive and push you in the best way. I cant say how many times I have cried after class so happy that they believed in me and pushed me in the best way possible. The business is so clean, and even the front desk ladies are wonderful. (Especially Abby.) I couldn't be happier. Thank you, OTF!",

  "text": "Brand spanking new gym (opened less than a year), lots of machines, clean and no judgment - what's there not to like about this gym?  There's also ample parking right outside and high ceilings, which I love!  The ladies' room is clean and there are showers and freeing areas, as well as a TV monitor for entertainment.  The Black Card Soa is wonderful, especially the hydro massage chairs - so soothing for my tired muscles after workouts.  It's a great gym and meets my needs. \n\nOk, it's not perfect but this is a much better option for a newbie like me!  (I am still ruminating about my review for another gym, a \"local\" gym, that I did not care for, but that's another post)\n\nStarted going to the gym to help and motivate my son, and we were at another gym.  This is important because I did not know how to work any of the typical gym equipment, other than the treadmill.  But I wanted so much to try out the other machines!  Unfortunately, the gym goers at that other gym were, in my opinion, gym regulars and hard core gym goers who would give me funny looks when I fumbled with the equipment.  Then my husband started going here, shortly after it opened, and he told me I should try it.  One of the best suggestions he's ever given me!  :) \n\nSo my son and I started coming here and after a couple visits, I got memberships for both of us and haven't looked back!  There are so many machines to choose from and if you don't know how to use a certain machine, no one is staring at you while you try to figure it out or someone will help you out!  By the way, the PF app can help with this.  As a side note - if I really can't figure out how to use a certain machine, I ask for help or wait until my husband can show me.  This is important because this is how machines break!  So if you can't figure it out, please walk away and leave the machine alone.  While there are lots of treadmills, stair climbers, etc., there area some machines of which there is just one of its kind, and once it's broken, there isn't another one available. \n\nThen there are the people who never wipe down the machines they use!  With flu season upon us, and the sweat and germs that others leave on the machines, one would think that people would want to wipe down the machines after they use it.  But no, that is not the case at all.  The majority of people just walk away without a second thought.  Absolutely disgusting! \n\nLast thing I'll mention is this - why would there be empty paper towel dispensers ever?  I've gone to the gym all hours - early morning, afternoon, night and late night - and many of those times, the paper towel dispensers are empty.  And it's not just in one area, it would be empty in at least two stations.  Perhaps the staff should make it a point to walk around during and after busy times to check?  Just a  suggestion, but the lack of paper towels just encourages people not to wipe the equipment down.  \n\nDespite the little things that annoy me, I still give this place 5 stars because besides it being new and clean, I am also comfortable here and that makes a world of a difference!",

During the week, this gym is 24/7 which is a major bonus.\n\nPF has rows of cardio equippment facing a row of TVs which is nice to view while running or cycling. They have some weight circuits and the typical run-of-the mill gym equipment. I have heard a lot of guys complain that they do not carry enough weights ( I wouldnt know).

However, I feel like you have to go with the right people because if you go with people who are easily distracted, I don't know if you will ever make it out of the room. \n\nFriday evening, some friends invited me to go and have some fun. We were a group of 6 so we did not have to join  another group. For all of us it was a new experience and to be honest we did not know what to expect.\n\nAs soon as we arrived they put us together and explain to us the rules. Rules that we have to follow in order not to \"cheat\". They also explained to us where can we look for clues but they are very careful to not give any clues away. The room we got into was called \"Christmas room\". I googled this room and I fount out that 95% of the people can get out of this room in 15 min. Well we were the other 5% because even that we got out just on time (almost an hour) we couldn't find any clues on time. \n\nThe hardest part is basically finding the first clue, after that you kind of have to follow the instructions in order to escape the room. It was an awesome experiences and I will definitely be back maybe with my fiancé and friends.",

We come by weeknights and weekend afternoons.\n\nIt's awesome seeing other members so pumped and focused on their own thing throughout  the sections of the gym. We see families mainly in pairs cheering each other on. Even though there are less equipment than other locations everything is spaced out and it feels more homey in general. \n\nMembers are polite in asking if you are done with equipment and some will even be friendly enough to let you know how much beefier you are getting.\n\nThe staff is great with communication. From day 1 we emailed back and forth about location specifics and promotions. The trainer that we signed up with was great and was not aggressive in trying to sell personal training sessions and things of that nature. We have even asked about other nearby gyms that specialized in other types of training, and the manager was nice enough to give ideas. The office area has the local homeopathic magazines which I like to take home for reading. \n\nThe gym is also well ventilated, fairly clean, and all emergency necessities are easily spotted. There has been recent renovations made to better accommodate floor based workouts. \n\nWe appreciate the convenience of the location and how relieved we are to unwind here after a hard workday!",

Showers were recently re done and the locker room doesn't smell horrible, the weights and machines and all up to date and nothing to old.  Pool is nice as well as the sauna and spa. \n\nI can see why you pay a little more here cause of the equipment and cleanness that this place offers.

I immediately quit my former gym and joined the sporting club.\n\nThe staff here are cool, the office people are chill, the desk girls are nice and helpful, the cafe people are nice, and the cleaning ladies are sweet to me always saying hello and asking how I am.  I've never used the personal trainers here as I've been scarred by my past trainer but they seem nice and not intimidating.  \n\nThe locker rooms are great there are always plenty of free lockers and plenty of clean towels.  One thing that irritates me is that women here often leave their wet towels all over the place and leave the locker doors just wide open after they've left.  If you're a grown woman you know how to just put your towel in the bin and close your door do you really not have the extra two seconds?\n\nAnyways the locker room connects to dressing rooms where they have deodorant, hairspray, and hair styling tools with big mirrors and individual vanities.  Then there are showers and bathrooms, they really think of everything here with disposable razors, shampoo, shaving Creme, shower caps, and body wash.  They also have a bathing suit dryer and little bags for your swimsuits.  \n\nThere is a jacuzzi but I don't use it since I've seen ladies go in there naked and I have a thing about germs.  Then there are sauna and steam rooms.  Then there is a lap pool that is coed in the back.\n\nThe second floor they have racquetball courts And a basketball court which I don't use.  The third floor is the fitness floor where they have the class rooms and the fitness floor.  There are always plenty of Cardio machines they have everything you could want.  The weight stuff looks like there is alot I don't use that stuff because i don't have a trainer anymore but it looks new?\n\nThen there is a track above that which i have run on and it doesn't get crowded so it's cool.\n\nI love this gym so much I'm gonna be sad to leave it when I move away.",

  "text": "I am new to CrossFit, and have been doing it now for about 3 months.  My experience has been fantastic.  My wife has done CrossFit on and off for several years as we have moved around.  Upon moving to STL, my wife looked at the CrossFit gyms near us and joined CrossFit Ballwin.\n\nI had been hesitant to join CrossFit for a number of reasons.  Among them, I have a back injury.  The idea of lifting weights or using barbells did not appeal to me whatsoever.  Also, I cannot stand the meathead/Bro environment.  After 5 or 6 months of my wife going to CrossFit Ballwin, and talking to me about it at home, I decided that I'd give it a try.  Also, my existing workout program seemed to be losing its effectiveness.  I'm over 40.  My body is changing, my metabolism is changing, my joints are aging, and so on.  So, I decided to try a change.\n\nFrom the very start, what they tell us is \"Listen to your body\" and \"Focus on your form first\".  This is exactly the thing I wanted to hear.  They spend a lot of time focusing on your form, with little or no weight, which is the intelligent thing to do.  \n\nThe facility itself is clean, well appointed, and in a convenient part of town.\n\nThe coaches are excellent.  Trent, the owner, is very experienced, extremely knowledgeable, and encouraging.  And he has a great staff of coaches with a diverse set of backgrounds and education.  The value is in the variety.  People learn differently, and they all have different approaches, analogies, demonstrations, and motivational and educational techniques.\n\nThe results I have seen in myself, even after just 3 months, are extremely motivating.  I am not \"an athlete\" per se.  My objective is to live a long, healthy life.  I want to have a strong core that helps with my back problems.  I want to have good cardiovascular health.  I want to have the flexibility and mobility to keep up with my kids.  I am getting more than my money's worth in this area.\n\nThe thing that probably keeps me going back as much as anything, however, are the other people who attend.  We range in ages and sizes and ability levels from one end of the spectrum to the other.  But there are ZERO egos. There is nothing but encouragement, and good energy.  People smile at each other.  People want to see each other succeed.  And everyone knows, when you start CrossFit, it doesn't matter who you are, you start at the beginning.  The level of support and positivity I have experienced have truly been exceptional.  \n\nIf you are looking to improve your health, improve your quality of life, and have a good time doing it, you should come.  Joining CrossFit Ballwin has been one of the best things I have done for myself and my family in a long, long time.",

It is a little bit too commercial but you get an INTENSE work out and the instructors really do push you to your max. They have parts during the class where they rank you against others in the class and for me that made me push harder because i was trying to beat the person infront of me. Seeing your name up on the scoreboard is pretty cool and gives you a sense of achievement at the end especially if you beat your personal best. They also keep track of your performance online after each class which is neat! If you want to sweat it out and have an amazing work out definitely go here. Love the upper body workouts they have incorporated in the routine! Yes i will be back!!",

The facilities are excellent and very clean. The class is pretty intense - similar to a brief experience I had with Orange Theory. You do multiple rounds of running on the treadmill and strength/core workouts. You can go at your own pace and no one judges you, which I really appreciated.

He knows how to put you on the right track for achieving your goals, no matter what they may be, but be prepared to work! You get every penny of what you pay for with him as a trainer.  You will leave knowing that every time you workout with Matt you are one step closer to being in the best shape you can possibly be in. The gym itself is clean and really well taken care of.  Andrew Pointer, the owner, takes pride in the state of the art equipment and maintaining a fun, safe environment for members to work out in.  All of the members wipe down the machines when they are done using them and, if you are in there every day like I am, you get to know the other members and can feel free to ask anyone for advice on how to use something if you don't know how.  Sarah has recently started hosting a live Zumba class on Thursday nights and it is a great way to make some new friends and have so much fun that it doesn't even feel like you are burning the major calories that you are. This is a judgement-free gym that offers encouragement and motivation to members.  You never have to wait to use equipment and being able to come anytime makes it easy to fit into any schedule.",

  "text": "This gym is big but it's incredibly hot inside. I start sweating as soon as I walk in. There is a sign claiming the temp is at 68 but it honestly feels like 80. They even cover it so you can't see what the actual temperature is. Huge red flag for lack of transparency. It's so hot that going in the winter, you can't even see inside. There is so much steam and perspiration on the windows. The fans are for cardio only and there is no air circulation in the weight room. It's so hot in there I always feel I'm on the verge of passing out. The water machine are also luke warm to hot. I was reading through reviews and I don't appreciate the manager's snarky replies to them. It's a serious concern how hot it gets in the gym, especially because right now it is winter. I can't imagine the temperature it could get to in the summer. Aside from this, there should really be more racks in the weight room. It's the only gym I know of with one rack. I won't be coming back to this one until they get their priorities straight and lower the temperature and put WORKING fans in all areas. The gym in 1st is much nicer.\n\nI came back to increase the rating. This gym is ok but the air situation needs to be resolved before someone has a serious health situation.",

  "text": "I can't quite get a handle on this SWEAT location... Having initially visited the Fitler Square spot, and gradually started adding in trips to the Center City location, I finally head over to Old City a few times for some group classes. I felt a little unsure of which door to enter, having gone to Brazen Boxing (which is on the THIRD floor of the same set of stairs) a few times, but didn't take long to figure it out. \n\nThe set up of bottom floor for weights, second floor for cardio is similar to the CC spot, and I don't hate it. Keeps things compartmentalized, though the cardio area doesn't really look out onto anything entertaining, there's never been a line for the equipment that I've seen upstairs. The weight area looks smallish, but again, I've never witnessed any issues here. Maybe it's less crowded regularly than the other locations I've been, though I tend to go during \"off-peak\" times. I don't love the tiny locker rooms.... tough for a long lady when there are a few other gals getting changed and cleaned up at the same time.\n\nThe group fitness room is large, but the pillars scattered throughout, as well as the cycles pushed against one wall, make it feel smaller. As a tall woman, I had to be careful when lifting my arms as there are a few beams that I would've knocked into had I not been careful. Good acoustics, enthusiastic teachers, and I imagine it might be nice to be in a spin class with a little better lighting than most.... but I don't think it's my favorite space for group fitness, I felt a little choked.\n\nI feel like I'm getting my money's worth with this membership, but there's always room for improvement. That room's not in the locker-room, though.... trust me.",

I have actually never been to another LA Fitness location as clean as this one. The weight rooms, locker rooms, and cardio areas are always clean. The staff is also friendly.\n\nUnfortunately this location also seems to be a scaled down version of the LA Fitness on Gulf-to-Bay. There is hardly any redundancy in the equipment and the floor feels a little claustrophobic. You really have to be mindful of where you're using free weights here as it is quite easy to step into someone else's space. I also found myself waiting a lot between sets due to the lack of redundancy in equipment. Definitely avoid going during peak hours. I also noticed that there wasn't a sauna, definitely lacking  for an LA Fitness.\n\nAll in all, a 5/5 for cleanliness and pleasantness but a 3/5 for completeness of the gym...so we land at a 4/5.",

  "text": "It's not as fancy as a lot of the newer gyms in Indy. No vast expanses of shiny wood floors or gleamingly silver machines here. It is, in fact, pretty utilitarian, but that's probably why it's also cheap. And it does the job. They have all the fitness center standards: free weight room, heated swimming pool, basketball and volleyball court, spinning studio, etc. I never use any of the machines, so I can't really speak to those, but the facility is in good condition. \n\nI've had good experiences with the staff, too. They will try to get you to buy a membership, like most gym staff, but they're not too terribly pushy about it. One really nice feature of this gym is the number of classes they offer--in addition to personal training, you can participate in a wide range of fitness classes, include water classes, spinning, cardio, yoga, etc. It's worth checking out their website, because they really do offer a lot. Even if you're not looking to become a member, many of the activities are available to the general public for a good price. \n\nExtra points for offering some unusual classes that a lot of gyms don't, like bellydancing. I took bellydancing here for several months last year, and had a good time, although it wasn't nearly as fun as Celeste at Aiki Concepts!",

Monthly membership costs are in-line (or cheaper) than other similar style gyms and I love the instructors AND the other folks that work out here. Nothing like seeing familiar faces every day to keep your motivation up. Another favorite: the instructors are diverse in their tactics. I can take 3 cardio kickboxing classes in one week and not feel like I'm doing the same thing each class. Plus they just upped their classes adding noon classes Mon-Fri.

  "text": "I have been going to Double Edge - South for three months.  Initially, I was leery of DE's price and was intimidated to say the least.  I firmly believed that I was not enough for crossfit; not strong enough, not fit enough, not thin enough.  I thought I was the type of person who didn't want to \"live\" at the gym and didn't think I would commit to attending often enough to make the membership cost worthwhile for me.  Well, I was wrong.  DE has changed my life, as corny and cliché as it sounds.\n  \nUpon walking through the doors of DE - South it is obvious why it is set above the rest.  It's clean, it's spacious, and dare I say...sexy.  The equipment is plentiful and impeccably maintained.  I have never once had to lift lighter or heavier than desired due to lack of equipment.  Everything I need to modify a workout to accommodate my fitness level and previous injuries is available. The location is convenient with lots of parking and safe areas to run outside.  The bathroom is the nicest gym bathroom that I have ever seen.  There are beautiful and clean toilets and showers and plenty of room and counter space for getting cleaned up after your workout.\n\n I received a one -on-one consultation with Joel, where he and I talked at length about my current situation, my goals, my strengths and my weaknesses.  Joel also took the time to really explain to me what crossfit is about and what specifically DE is about, which no other gym had taken the time to do.  Throughout our discussion, Joel started mapping out a game plan tailored specifically to me.  I could tell right away that he was genuine and truly listened.  Once we had our game plan laid out, he walked me through a quick crossfit style work out.  I liked the fact that I was able to do this privately and felt less intimidated than if I had just walked in off the street not knowing anything about the gym or crossfit.\n\nWhile I have had the pleasure of working with many of the coaches, I mostly train with Joaquin, Kris, and Jacob.  They are all properly certified and are continuously educating themselves to achieve higher qualifications. The coaches are also diversifying their backgrounds to include nutrition among other aspects.  Class sizes are often small and usually include two coaches to ensure that you are getting the attention and instruction you need to avoid injury and get the best possible workout.  I never feel that the classes are overcrowded and really appreciate that the coaches take the time to properly explain and demonstrate each move.  The coaches take the time to get to know you personally and are very receptive and helpful when it comes to any adjustments you may need to make.\nOne of the best things about DE is that I never feel judged - not by the coaches nor the members.  Every single person is encouraging and friendly.  We are all from different fitness levels, ages, shapes and sizes.  Everyone is incredibly supportive.\n\nIf you are wanting to change your life and step up your game in a fun and encouraging environment, then DE - South is the place for you! I promise that you won't regret the time, effort and money you will invest in yourself at Double Edge.",

There is a lounge area where you can get coffee or food, there is a gym shop in the front, they let you use nice fluffy towels as soon as you walk in, there is a HUGE weight/cardio room, a nice size indoor pool, the women's locker room is posh with lockers made of wood, showering facilities.  It's frigging amazing!  \nIf I had a family I would definitely sign up for this gym because there is so much for the kids to do.  \n\nAs for the zumba class, it was awesome!  We went on a Wednesday night and the instructor was on a platform so it was easy to see her.  Plus there were other instructors in the front on both sides so you could follow them as well.  It was an awesome workout and the people in the class were very nice in helping us pick up the steps for the routine!\n\nHappy Working Out!",

I think it just depends on what you are looking for in a gym. It's a huge facility with lots of options, but anytime I went upstairs to use the equipment I got sick from all the dust. The entire place just felt dirty. That was my only complaint, but caused me to cancel my membership after a month.",

After the shut down, I was charged YET AGAIN when the gym opened up. $730 and I don't think the battle is over. Save your time, money, and overall hygiene and go somewhere else. They charge you out of the a** for personal training but then pay their employees $10/hr. Absolutely disgusting. Can't wait to watch them run their business into the ground.",

I like the fact that they offer full body scans which give them the ability to break down your body composition letting you know how much of your body is lean body mass, how much is fat, body fat percentage etc..\nSauna is included and they have an area upstairs with boxing bags which I use occasionally for some rigorous cardio. They also have a carpeted area downstairs occasionally used for personal training but when not being used they have a sled that you can use,Tire flip with a sledgehammer, and box jump platforms.I would definitely recommend this gym it's in a good area and it's located in a plaza with a grocery store nearby just in case you needed to grab something for dinner.",

The 3rd visit I told Rich - legs and butt hurt, upper body and arms are fine. I'll fix that he says. Enter the kickboxing side kicks! OMG!! My sides and love handle muscles are alive. This workout is it! I have no intention of stopping - I'm in. After a month of this I'm going to be ripped. Thank you Richard and 9-Round Kickboxing for such a smart, effective workout. 5 STARS.",

The spinning classes are awesome. Some of the sweetest people are in the spinning classes, and they make you feel at home. The instructors can be a little demanding, but, that's kind of their job. You burn tons of calories, and that's what you're there for. Yoga with Denise is awesome, too, but get there early. It fills up. \n\n3. The amenities are sub-par, which is why I gave it 3 stars. The place is a little out of date, and the locker room is a spa by no means, but they do have showers, restrooms, towels, and lockers. \n\n4. It's huge. There are tons of machines, most of which have TVs on them, a separate are for free weights, and a pretty big stretching area as well, where you can do sit ups or push ups.\n\nIn San Francisco, I pay 15 bucks a class, so I'm going to reiterate, this place is a STEAL.",

I do notice that it tends to get crowded in the early evening; however, there are a lot of machines to use. The lay-out of the equipment is by muscle group which is very helpful for me! I went into this gym mainly for the pool, as I love to swim, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that a chain fitness center was so well- run. I admit that the initial push for personal training was a bit much and I was not thrilled with the exercises they introduced into a workout, so I passed on training. I would have liked to have a trainer in the beginning to re-introduce some of the machines to me as I worked with weight training in a couple of years. Otherwise, I am very happy with this La Fitness.",

  "text": "*** Note: the experience with the masseurs would get 5-stars automatically, but it was the initial encounter that landed this experience with a 3-star rating. This review does not reflect the service of the masseurs. *** \n\nThis was my first time coming here today. I decided to treat my cousin to a spa day to relieve some pre-final test as well as to unwind from the daily stresses of life. we had a Groupon and we wanted to use it before it expired. I originally dealt with Debbie when I was booking the appointment and she was the epitome of rude. She made me feel like I was inadequate because I was using a Groupon. She also made me feel rushed so I ended up calling back and confirming everything with Lauren, who was extremely pleasant. Fast forward to today: the day of the appointment. I called and spoke with Andrea (who was very nice) to let her know that we would be a little late due to the fact that there was a Saints home game. She completely understood and told us to arrive when we could. When we got there, she showed us to the area where we would chance and she let us go. Now, Debbie comes in and she's talking to me in a condescending tone because my Groupon said redeemed and that it wasn't supposed to say that. It stated redeemed on the day of the appointment at the time we checked it. I told her I didn't know why it said that because I had never used the Groupon prior to this visit. She then tells me she would need to verify the Groupon code, which at this point I didn't care what she did. When she came back she then proceeds to remind us that \"we are late\" and we need to \"hurry because our masseurs are waiting.\" My whole experience with her was rude and very unprofessional. She made me and my cousin feel very uncomfortable. She would be the main reason while I'd never return. The only way I would return would be if she either retires or ended up getting fired for being a total b****. \n\nFast forward to our massages: we had the 50-minute Swedish massage with coconut oil. My cousin had Pia and I had Jacob. They were both amazing. They turned a rough experience into something pleasurable. They were very attentive and my massage was simply amazing. \n\nFor anyone interested in going to Balance, please AVOID DEBBIE AT ALL COSTS! If you can, please speak with Andrea and ask for Pia and Jacob! You won't be disappointed!!! \n\n*please excuse all typos...sent from my iPhone*",

I wish I would have listened. The planning process was unorganized-they would call for details and I would call back and give them details (ie. number of kids, pizza etc.) and then the owner would call back asking for the same thing I had communicated to her employees. The owner was rude and continually hurried us through the party to make sure we were out on time (actually even a few minutes before) and hovered around to make sure of it-she was very much in it just for the money and made zero attempt at making the birthday girl feel a tad special despite the amount of money we spent-she didn't even acknowledge her and wish her happy birthday and was completely all business and rude throughout the entire experience.  If you are in the business of kids parties and operating a kids business you need to be more in touch with your clientele.  The \"hosts\" for the party were virtually non-existent and stood in the corner.  I have hosted numerous parties and this was by far the worst place. The party room was also old, dated and dirty. We will never host another party here. Jump-man-Jump does a FAR superior job-they keep things moving without making you feel rushed or like a bother to them.",

I would like to say that this is not your house so it doesn't have to be perfect and the way you want it (who knows your house might be dirtier) some of you may not even know how to clean a house. \n\nI would start by saying that this is a business after all. Most of you work in business...right? I mean we don't all enjoy our jobs and when we hate it we leave and find something better....\nMost people that work there for the most part do it for the membership or the things they could get out of it---it's like any of you who work and see what are the best benefits you get out of this job before actually committing it and when poop hits the fan you leave. But there are some that put their all into making your fitness and health better! Like the trainers and management.\nJust because the cleaning lady decided she wanted to go doesn't mean you get to whine about the bathrooms. , go home and take a shower if it hurt your soul oh so much. \nJust because the guy / girl at the front doesn't know the answer doesn't mean they're rude. For heaven sake these kids come in after school and sometimes things don't always get communicated.\nYou make a commitment when you signed up for the gym for the love of Pete, read the stuff before you sign it. Like dude what the hell do you just go around signing your life away? Who does that anyhow? Ah I lost money with training and guess what I've lived. I'm still living and I'm annoyed so I'm writing this review.\n\nPSC Radnor has been a big part of my sanity! It helped me get away from a lot of things. I've made a shit ton of friends there and in fact the staff those who stayed and even the ones who left, definitely made an impact on my time here. So what the machine is broken, perhaps you behind needs a new workout. Go lift some weights get out of your comfort zone and push yourself. STOP EXPECTING MACHINE, DIRTY BATHROOMS AND BROKEN SOAP DISPENSERS TO RULE YOUR GYM EXPERIENCE. These people working at the gym are human beings, who just like you go to work and try their best to help you as much as they can. So stop whining and go work out and be fit in this fat America! \n\nOkay I'm annoyed and I love this gym!!!",

  "text": "7 days and still no response- had to call Omar 4x and just got lip service. \nHello, \nI am writing to lodge a complaint about aqua fit instructor Linda at Fort Washington PA on Wednesday, September 16 at 6 PM class. Linda was extremely rude to me as a first-time attendee at her class. When I first went in and took the barbells she assumed because of my weight that I could not keep up with the class when I tried to fill the weights with water she said this is a very hard class you might not want to do that. She assumed I had not taken the class before however I've been in aqua fit for over 10 years. When it was time to split into groups Linda just pointed at me didn't ask my name and said \"you\" go over there. I was pretty angry at how rude she was. There were eight other women in the class. The one that she teamed me up with said, \"Oh we are used to her. She's not very nice. I said I don't have to get used to her and I left the class. When I went into the locker room I heard Linda talking about me behind my back saying that I couldn't keep up with the class and that she didn't care. I confronted her and said that I pay for her class she said \"You don't pay for me go talk to my manager I will be here anyway nothing will happen\". I told her that she was rude she said this is just the way she is and I could not keep up with her class. I have never been so disrespected at any gym in my life  I just paid the $99 fee so I could switch clubs- I regret that decision and would like a refund of that money I will never go back to Ft Washington and I may leave LA fitness for good.. I would like that apology to be from Linda. thank you.\nIt's been 3 days and no action has been taken from Omar the manager.",

  "text": "This location is huge. It is easy to access from hillsborough and has plenty of parking. The membership desk is directly in front of you when you walk in. There is a running track - the only crunch I've seen in the area with one - a large areas with machines and a smaller area with free weights. There are treadmills, bikes, rowers, ellipticals of all sorts and a Jacobs ladder. 5\nThere is also a weight lifting area with a few squat racks and heavy weights. They have drinks in a cooler for sale and some shirts. There are classes upstairs with the running track and an area like CrossFit with monkey bars, battle ropes and other various things. There is also a kiddie corner area. I would inquire within to find out  how that works, I'm not sure how it does. They have classes for those that opt in to the higher tier membership but I myself haven't been to any here. It is a spacious room and always sounds like there's a lot of energy.\n\nThe women's locker rooms are spacious. There are 3 changing stalls, a small area with a tv and a couch, a locker area and 4 showers. The set up is a little weird as the changing stalls are on the other side of the locker room from the showers. The shower curtains are cheap and have fallen down so just be mindful. They also clean at 7 am in the morning so be mindful if you don't like the smell of chemicals while you shower. Other than that the locker room is great. There's a large mirror above the sinks and of course a sauna. Compared to other crunch locations, the sauna is a nice size. There is also a full length mirror closer to the actual lockers. \n\nThe staff is hit or miss. Some of the staff is great and super friendly but some of the staff have no manners and lack of interest in those who don't sign up for training. The young lady who works in the morning during the week is super sweet and has been helpful in the past. She is personable and always has a smile on her face. I also had membership issues so just verify your membership after you sign up or if you upgrade. I went back and forth for a few weeks because no one would fix the issue. It wasn't just this location. I tried to resolve it with multiple locations. This location actually was able to fix it.",

I had no idea how to cycle but the instructors (and other riders!) were so friendly and happy to help. I got an amazing workout at each class, and had so much fun! I particularly loved Jamie's music choices and Marissa's energy. A (huge) bonus was the beautiful studio - clean, with free shoes and water (unlike soul cycle), and Duross & Langel in the showers!

Definitely less crowded than most gyms around. Good space between folks. Separation rooms for powerlifting, stretching, etc. which makes it less noisy and disruptive. Pretty good hours open. Variety in music is played day to day, never slow boring music though. Always something with a good beat for working out. \n\nCons: not enough equipment for smaller muscle groups - TONS of legs and chest stuff but lacking in shoulders and biceps etc. They could use an additional cable crossover and updated cardio equipment; kind of dingy with shelves falling off the walls and not enough spray and paper towels around.\n\nCOVID-wise, patrons are all wearing masks. Staff doesn't harp on you for taking a few breaths outside your mask but they seem to be regularly making rounds to make sure people are masked.",

I had to navigate around people who made their own parking spaces along edges of the lot.  The staff is super friendly, but the clientele not so much.  I had to deal with a guy working out next to one of two rowing machines who refused to move away so I could use the rowing machine.  I had to scrounge to find a locker that wasn't full - awfully trusting people putting stuff in lockers with no lock.  The walking track is great most of the time, especially for me since I have to be careful walking outdoors due to hearing impairment.  But then you get the people who run like they are being chased who have no problem nearly knocking you over even when you are in the very clearly marked WALK lane.  I loved this place at first, but now I am going to switch to the Athenaeum or Ransburg even though they aren't as slick looking.",

My kids are 2, 4, and 8, and they are ALL enrolled in at least 2 classes at the NAC. Even on weekends when they don't have classes, my wife and I go to work out, and my kids are THRILLED to go to the kids club. The Kids Club staff is exceptional. \n\nMy daughter takes dance, gymnastics, and Yoga (Yes, they have a Yoga class for kids!) and she loves it. On busy nights, we can eat in the Cafe after exercising. There are always healthy choices, and even some 'treats\" for the kids. \n\nNow, working out - I do olympic lifts (dropping the weights making noises), and no one has a problem with it. There is ALWAYS a piece of cardio equipment available. There's space to jump rope. There's multiple spaces for what I call \"functional training\" - flipping tires/pushing & pulling sleds, etc. There is ALWAYS something new to try as well. TRX,  Spinning, cross-training, yoga, pilates (reformer and floor) all kinds of aerobics. Also leagues and clubs of all kinds if you want to play some kind of competitive sport. Lastly,  the club is always looking to improve, and constantly adding new services. \n\nI've even worked out with a couple personal trainers there, and they are rock solid. If you want someone who is knowledgeable and can bring you back from an injury, they have the right staff for that. If you are a conditioned athlete, and you want to do something new, or want to be pushed to your limits, those trainers are there too.\n\nMy perspective is that of someone who has worked extensively in health clubs, and I'm now a father of three, and I have to say ESPECIALLY if you are a family, you won't find a more comprehensive facility anywhere that I've ever lived.",

The gym provides plenty of disinfectants, wipes, sanitizer; also, clean locker and restroom/shower facilities; plenty of warm fresh towels...like anywhere, in the final analysis it's up to each patron to exercise common courtesy. In three very satisfying years, I've always found my fellow gym patrons very courteous and respectful.\n\nLet me share a recent anecdote: sometime ago, in CT, I purchased a new Polar heart monitor etc watch. Not being very adept at setting same, I had to go begging around the Equinox I belong to in CT for help. I was told: no one knows how. Rather than challenge the ludicrous, I waited until I was back in Tucson. Dan cheerily did the settings right off!\n\nHighly recommended in every respect!",

Peeeeyouuu!  The main workout room is so noisy and from the smell, it's not cleaned....so who wants to get on equipment with other people's sweat??? \n\n Also, the pool room is dark and dreary, the water is cloudy...and there are always people lurking in the spa, like it's a pick up place....not to mention the H2o Zumba class is the worst I've tried--all Salsa music (can't relate to all Spanish music!) and no inspiration from the \"teacher\", she doesn't even know who we are or try to get to know her class--so I even stopped going there too.  The parking lot is so full there is never a spot even half way close to the door and it's not lit well at night.  Creepy.\n\nI'm out a chunk of change every darn month until the blasted contract is up.  So, hey guys, we all need exercise and it's great to have a personal assessment so we know what's right for our body type, but I refuse to be treated like I'm just not good enough and stuck in a contract with ZERO response from my calls!  \n\nWhat a HUGE disappointment.....Buyer beware people!",

I have been there when they first open all the way through the end of the night and I have never felt like it was busy which is of course a huge plus. \nThe childcare center is phenomenal! My baby boy is just shy of two years old and he loves everyone who works there! They're all so loving and patient and they will do everything they can before they have to come pull you out of your exercise. Some days I don't have him with me and they ask me how he is and why he isn't there. That shows me they take the time to get to know your child and really do care.\nThe trainers are absolutely top notch! My personal favorites are Laura, Angie and Jamie! They're energy level is unmatched! They kick your butt and make you work hard without belittling you. They make you want to give your all and push yourself which is what I need! I joined Angie's boot camp class and it has completely changed my life and way of thinking! The way she has developed a sense of community is just amazing! I wouldn't dare go  anywhere else! \nThe staff that checks you in and that you see throughout the gym is very kind and helpful. \nOverall, I love this gym and the people that is apart of it!",

  "text": "My family discovered My Gym early in 2018 after permanently moving from San Diego to Tucson. We started off at their Pre School Prep along with their camps & they have been a blessing to us! I have 2 girls ages 3 & 4 and My Gym has been nothing but amazing for us. We haven't found anything that is as welcoming & fun as this place is. My girls take a weekly class, frequent open play & parents night out! All the teachers are wonderful, so kind and loving towards all the kids. Everyday is a good day here! My oldest daughter just celebrated her early  5th birthday here and we were so happy with everything. Not only did they make my life easier by planning & supplying everything but all her friends had such a great time! This center is for all ages, so many different classes that accommodates every child's needs. Our family is grateful to have found such a wonderful establishment. If you are looking for a place where your kids will be safe & have so much fun, I highly recommend it.",

  "text": "Ok I'm a regular at the beech groove location but I come here a couple days a week so I might as well review this too.\nThis place is immaculate. There is always a staff member cleaning and the bathrooms are spotless. The locker rooms are just like the high end gyms around here. Spacious and you can put your lock on there. I like that the lockers have the \"mesh\" design so you can kinda see in the locker. Sometimes I evidentially use way too much oxygen during my workout and I forget which locker I put my stuff in so I don't look crazy trying to get into every locker. Showers are nice and provide soap, they have hair dryers and a dressing room. Two big mirrors. \nThe gym itself:\nI like the beech groove location better but a lot of weight lifters will disagree with me and I'll explain why. This gym has rows all facing a giant mirror. 4 rows are cardio machines then the free weights and serious weight stuff is in front of the mirror. I could care less about a mirror but I know for people who use weights you need to see your form. I've never had a problem getting on the arc trainer or treadmill. \nBlack card member benefits:\nFreaking awesome.\nThis place is better than beech grooves black member perks because of the layout and perks.\nThe massage room is awesome. It's dark and relaxing. It lets you get away as you lay down (or sit depending on your choice of massage).\nTanning beds are insanely awesome. They have 3 different type (and levels of beds). One stand up and 2 different laydown. 12 beds in total.\nStaff:\nOk I've looked on glass door and I know these employees get paid very little. With that said, how do they find these employees?? At both locAtions these guys not only get along with each other But they actually like us customers. They will talk and joke Around with you. They clean, actually like their jobs, and are very helpful. I really want to know how they have such great staff for what they pay them. I am out of space to review :)",

Your workout classes are great and I love that you are expanding, but you have a severe bug problem in your classroom and I was told that I had 24 access to everything, INCLUDING unlimited tanning. When I tried to use the tanning booth today, I was told that the booths closed at 6PM. I thought that was ok, but I wanted to purchase replacement eye protection just in case and the lady at the front counter said that all the computers were shut down. I glanced over at the machines and all the monitors were on and some were at the club fitness screensaver.

  "text": "Gym atmosphere - 5 stars\nAmenities - 4 stars (particulary because of parking and locker room availability).\nPersonal training - 5 stars\nGroup fitness - 5 stars\nStaff - 5 stars\n\nAmenities:\n- Towel service\n- Food Items. I believe they partnered with a nutrition organization that actually can prepare and deliver food to your home. That food was also provided in the gym and includes things like egg whites, fruit, salads, protein options, nuts, and some other food types. There are also beverages available for purchase.\n- Nutrition expert consultations available for a fee\n- Massage Therapist available for a fee\n- And a few others that I can't recall\n\nI heard about this gym and saw the opportunity to try it out by purchasing a 3-month groupon special, which included a full 3 month membership, and 3 personal training sessions. I think this deal was valued at approximately $400.\n\nThis gym is owned by a former Olympic power lifter and he uses that philosophy towards training and fitness. That means there are not a bigillion cardio machines for all you folks that believe in endless cardio as the answer to burning fat and building muscle.\n\nThis is the type of gym where the regulars know each other and so does the staff because it's pretty small. 189 occupancy, so that gives you an idea of the size. However, I feel that it should Be much smaller. I would say there are 4-5 elliptical machines and 5-6 treadmills. The rest is weight training equipment.\n\nTypically I go into a gym with a mean face to prevent people from talking to me because I am actually intimidated by some of the people that work there so I try to show my strong face (go figure).  However, it's not like that there. Everyone has a friendly face. Most patrons also have a face that means business. \n\nThis gym is structured for personal training sessions. When I come on a Saturday morning and there were approximately 6 personal trainers working with clients. I completed three sessions with a trainer and she was very knowledgeable, motivating, and thorough. I believe her name is Jessica.  I have observed in working with her and interacting with other staff members that their philosophy to proper form is core element to healthy and safe fitness. There are several postings of dynamic warm ups and cool downs that the staff expect for clients to complete before starting any routine. I found it very helpful in properly warming up the body without defaulting to stretching.\n\nIf you are not into personal training (or can't afford it) then I think the next bet would be the group fitness classes here at the Lab Gym. What I really love about the group fitness classes is that you can sign up at least five days before hand to save your spot online or in person, particularly because space is limited.  Unlike other gyms, the group fitness room only fits 15 (depending on the class) so it doesn't feel that crowded.They will also send emails out to all members if a class has been cancelled or rescheduled at the past minute. The majority of the group fitness classes designed by LesMills and most start with the world 'body'. Body flow (yoga/Pilates), body pump (weight training), body combat (kick boxing), Zumba, and RPM (spinning). The classes listed above are included in your membership. There is one special boot camp class that's taught by the owner for an additional per class fee. I have tried Body Combat and Body Pump consistently during my membership, both of which were good full body workouts so I would definitely recommend taking them. I also tried Zumba once, but wasn't too interested in that form of workout. \n\n*Tip - When I was there, the group fitness schedule was often structured (regarding body pump and body combat) to have body pump first, and body combat following. I typically signed up for both classes to get resistance training and cardio in for the day.\n\nWomen's locker room: really small! One shower (which I never used) about 30 school size lockers, 4 stalls. When there was more than three women using the locker room it felt crowded. Because of this, I would often change before coming to the gym- if I was coming from work, for example. However, the locker rooms were always clean.\n\nParking: there is meter parking, a small 15 car lot that is shared by 3 other businesses, and a smaller non-metered street behind the establishment, which is a little sketch (from a woman's perspective) so I don't park there. Parking lot is typically full by 5pm on the week days (peak gym time) and by 9am on Saturdays. However, I can't speak to other times outside of the ones stated above.",

  "text": "I got Crunch Fitness flyer in the mail a while ago, my membership at 24 Hour Fitness expires end of August, so I was considering joining with a $5 promotion, listed here... https://www.crunch.com/join?club=reno&plan=Peak%20Results. \n\nIt says $49 enrollment fee plus 1st month for $5. There is an annual enrollment fee, does not list a date, but costs, $49. After that you choose a plan at $9.95 (basic 1 club) $19.95 (all the clubs, plus more perks) and lastly,  $29.95 (every club, bell, and whistle). \n\nI thought for $5, it would be worth checking out, so I called the local crunch fitness, as I wanted to inquire about contracts, cancellation, and get a free day/week of training to decide on joining. \n\nI spoke with the rep, who was upfront that I cannot see the club it's not open yet, but the promotion would expire as soon as the club opens, which means instant price increases. If you want to lock in the prices, you could sign up now and can cancel. Okay, that sounds like a reasonable risk, especially at $5 to check it out. \n\nThen I learn it's only $5 now, once they open whatever plan you choose, you pay that on opening day, so essentially no first month at $0. I inquired, and she said how they explain is they don't charge you a month while they are not open. \n\nI was told I could cancel, no contracts, I would just need to speak to a manager. The annual fee is about 60 days after you start. So, I am assessing, and it sounds like I would pay $34.95 ($29.95 day 1 gym open, plus $5 enrollment fee) to decide if I liked the gym, it's a risk worth pursuing. \n\nI then asked if opening in person would help rep out, since being in sales I understand when someone provides service, you should give them business, if they provided value, etc. Rep only wanted to what's best for me, but did after prying say it does help for her to enroll in person. I agreed to set an appointment, I figured, I would get a better view of the club, but then found out, I could not, as they are working out of kiosk in Meadowood Mall, by women's Macy's. \n\nTo make a long story short, when I arrived in person, I still was hung up on $5 for enrollment and 1st month, why is it not? I let her know she explained as best as possible, and then decide to get support. The 2nd staff member, does not come off professional, there's a sign in front of me that says, \"No Judgments\" but I felt a lot of judgment. \n\n2nd rep restated what the 1st rep said, we don't charge you until we open, that's what the 1st month free is, she even said, \"Lots of places do it\". I pressed for specifics, \"Please give me some examples of who does?\" I let her know I felt it was unfair and deceptive advertising, and that I used to be in advertising and I have business degrees, and her reply was, \"I don't need to tell you\". \n\nAfter all this I was about to sign up, because I do want a new and clean gym, and the biggest draw was getting a permanent discount, even though there's no contract. As I stated before I was about to sign up online, and it tries to get you to sign up with debit card, but you can sign up with a credit card (CC), and have to click a button to make the option for all the payments. \n\nAs I was signing up, I provided a CC and was told I also needed to provide a debit card. I protested, she grabbed the unprofessional judgmental coworker, and who came over with a smirky snide, \"Hello again\" who told me, \"I had to put up a 2nd payment form, which HAD to be a DEBIT CARD\". I mentioned online, it gave the strictly CC options, which she says, \"That's true, but when you come in, you have to give us your debit card\". At this point, to many Red Flags, and I said, I am out, which I think made her happy. My guess is she's unprofessional as they are getting lots of negative feedback about Unfair and Deceptive Advertising and are over explaining this constantly.  \n\nWorking in banking, giving up your debit card can lead to many problems, and they can be very expensive and time consuming (debit card fraud claims are no FUN). I would have been happy to provide 2 CC's, and I had my wallet open and it was obvious your could see multiple CC's in my open tri-fold wallet, I was not provided this an option, which I would have been happy to comply, as CC's protect you! \n\nI am sending a link to this review to Crunch Fitness too. Also I am adding a SNIP from the website, so when the link goes down you can see the exact wording, that is Unfair and Deceptive advertising.",

  "text": "As expected, the first thing they started to was ask me stupid questions about my goals when I inquired about membership. In so tired of market strategies employed by gyms. I don't care about your product line, your personal training sessions, or your different membership levels. The first thing they asked is \"what my goals are?\" I immediately answered by saying \"going to work out as soon as possible.\" Then they asked for my home number, email and some other questions about other gyms that I work out at. I politely told the guy that none of that matters and to just sign me up for the cheapest plan you have without a contract. Sorry Fitness Connection but I'm not going to listen to a business lecture; I'm not buying a time-share. Even during slow hours this place is packed. They have absolutely everything you would need but be aware that it is very busy. Pretty much all of the dumb bells have missing numbers/weight amounts so sometimes you have to guess which is ridiculous. A lot of the Precor/Life Fitness machines are missing the directional placards which can be a problem for new people. It bothered me even though I'm pretty familiar with the fitness world. Also, some of the Precor/Life Fitness machine have increment weights that have the increment rubbed off or missing so you don't know if you're on the 0, 5, 10 or 15 increment. With as much money as this place is making with its sketchy marketing strategies they should be keep these machines up. It's relatively clean and for the $10 a month plan it's decent enough but if you have a problem with crowded gyms then this place is not for you.",

I don't want to give even one star but the sales manager, Josh made sure my babies and I were okay with our first visit today and apologized for what had happened to us so I'm giving stars. I'm a happy Lifetime member and I enjoy my visits with my family at NY location. No complains! However, after today's visit to Mt. Laurel location as a guest, I was very disappointed. I felt very offended by their unwelcoming staff (Abby at the front desk and Odeta at Kids Academy). Especially with that kind of staff and attitude at Kids Academy, I will NEVER leave my kids there.",

  "text": "Our memberships were transferred here from Fitness 19 when they recently closed. They had reps at F19 the final week explaining they would be taking over our memberships and keeping our current rate plans, also explaining the amenities and location of their club. We were really wanting to enjoy it here, and the staff was super friendly when we came in. I'm not a gym snob at all, but I did manage the operations for a 24 Hour fitness about a decade ago, and we had newer equipment than this place. Their cardio equipment is a hodgepodge of stuff that looks about 20 years old. I saw someone step on a machine and a piece of plastic broke off. There are loose wires coming out of the ground not connected to anything and they have duct tape holding other wires to the carpet. A lot of concerns from a safety standpoint come to mind here.  It was really warm the day we worked out, and I heard someone else ask their staff if the AC was working, she replied yes, it's on full blast, but it definitely didn't feel like it--more like the heat was on. The free weights and machine side is what it is, no frills, kind of old school, no real problem there. Classes are included, which they seem to have a lot of and they also have a smoothie bar.  I was really blown away though by the fact that they stated to us that  we were getting a great deal from our old membership with F19, because normally their memberships are roughly $30.00 a month. We were paying $10.00 at F19. Great location, not-great parking and in bad need of a cardio re-fresh. We'll look elsewhere.",

This was because the person who opened didn't know how to get the lights on. Thankfully, you could go swimming as there were some overhead lights left on.

I began my training in the Strong and Healthy Woman's program with a colleague of mine over 5 years ago.  I had no formal gym knowledge and knew nothing about kettlebells.  That didn't matter.  Everyone took the time, and with great patience, to help me learn and become stronger. After a year or so with the Strong and Healthy Woman's Program I moved over to the Barbell Club.  I've never looked back.  The Barbell club has helped me achieve strength goals I never thought were possible.  I have continued my strength training through two pregnancies and was supported and cared for every step of the way. Tucson Strength has given me confidence in an area of my life that I didn't know was possible. In my profession it is important that I have an outlet for stress release; Tucson Strength is that place.  I know when I walk in that not only will I be challenged and told to #handlemyshit, but that I will be cared for like I am family.   I've seen this gym expand and grow not only in knowledge but in size too.   The new facilities cannot be matched. Danny, thank you.  You guys are remarkable.",

I came originally wanting to learn more about self defense and get a good workout but I came out of it building a ton of confidence and building tons of strength. The community is great and everyone is really in the zone during a class. Every class is fun a diverse and you can build skill easily with time. The coaches are super supportive and incredibly kind. It's 100% worth the price if you are interested. There's a class for everyone and a ton of different times so you can fit it into your schedule (I'm a waitress and a student so I'm super busy but there's still classes I can always fit in.) whatever level of strength or fitness you're at I recommend trying it out, it gives you a boost in your step and the classes don't even feel as long as they are because they are so engaging.

To be honest, I have no idea who the old owner was, but I definitely know the new one - Mallory. She is here constantly. Day time class, she's here, nighttime class, she's here, I don't think she ever leaves. I love supporting locally owned and operated businesses and this one checks all the boxes.\n\nNow that I'm no longer pregnant, I no longer take prenatal yoga. Lucky for me, there is Mommy and Me Yoga! This studio is super family and kid friendly. They have yoga for older children as well. My class is for 18 months and younger. If you are thinking about bringing a baby to yoga, do it. Are you afraid your baby will misbehave and you'll be judged? Don't worry about that, there is no way your baby is crazier than mine. In the past eight classes we have taken, I've done maybe a total of an hour of yoga combined. All those other babies laying on the ground? None of those are my baby, mine is being held in the air Simba style, and that's ok. The great thing is this is more about the community than the yoga. I've made great friends in this class and I bet anyone who visits will too.\n\nBut let's say you aren't pregnant or a mom, they have tons of other classes. I had some classes leftover from the pack I bought for prenatal so I used it for Yoga for the back. The class was awesome and the people are super friendly. Again, I felt like I was part of a community. \n\nYoga not your thing? They also have barre and ballet classes. Barre is the one fitness class that I hated in the past, I shook the whole time, but I'm willing to try it again. \n\nIf you're looking for a yoga studio, give this one a try. I bet you'll love it as much as I do.",

It is the studio to which we compare all other studios. BE attains the yoga community energy on and off the mat.

I lost weight from the Immersion class alone. I recommend taking the Immersion class, as Lithe is very much its own thing, and mastering the basics will allow you to get much more out of the workouts in the regular classes.\n\nThe food is also delicious, although it's overpriced and probably not a sustainable habit for most people.

I've only done the TRX and Barre classes here but they also have Zumba, pilates, yoga, etc. \n\nA few comments-yes, some of the instructors vary in quality and teaching style which stinks because these classes are expensive and for what you're paying, you should be able to get consistency.  This is normal for gyms though bc you will like some teaching styles better.\n\nIt is also pricey which deters me from going more often.

I joined for their morning circuit class taught by an InnerStrength trainer and quickly fell in love with their evening Yoga classes (taught by Sanctuary For Yoga) and Abs classes (also from InnerStrength). Their workout room is small but rarely used and contains two elliptical machines, a rowing machine, a treadmill, a bike and countless weights. I've never had to wait for either. Tuesday nights are a pretty crazy time to go as there are many young children climbing.",

  "text": "Stacy, I respectfully disagree with your opinion.  So what if the employees are young and \"fit\"?  It's a GYM!  They are there to represent health and fitness... I'm sorry that you felt inadequate and out of place but trust me, the staff here is incredibly friendly and remarkably more so than the staff at other gyms in Tucson.  I have been a member of Chuze since before they opened their first location in central Tucson.  I know for a fact that every staff member is incredibly approachable and trained on how to use all the pieces of equipment in the facility.  Not having the confidence to approach a staff member on how to use the equipment is nobody's fault  I am more than positive that had you given them a chance instead of prejudging them based on their physical appearance, you too would be a believer of Chuze.  \n\nI will say, however, that this gym is not for everyone.  If you are looking for a gym where you walk in and are immediately greeted by a personal trainer that is going to put you through a tailored and customized workout, Chuze is not for you.  There are other area gyms that will cater to this type of clientele, but their membership prices are upwards of $80-$300/month.  \n\nWhat I love about Chuze fitness and all their clients that go there is that we all have one thing in common- we all started somewhere.  Wether you are just looking to \"tone up\", overweight, or trying to maintain fitness, Chuze fitness will always be there to provide the tools you need to reach your goals.  All you have to do is make the commitment to yourself and start going.  No one can make that choice except for you.\n\nAs far as the bank account goes, there is no way that Chuze withdraws $40 out of your account every month.  Their highest tier of membership is $19.99 a month and with tax it comes to $21.39.  They have withdraw dates either 2 or three times a month and the date that they withdraw will be clearly printed on the terms of service that you would have signed upon joining- that is probably the \"reminder\" you would want to refer to.\n\nI myself will admit that I have not been the most dedicated in going the last 6 months.  However this is a subscription service, not a pay as you go kinda deal.  So that means wether you go or not, you bet that the money will still be withdrawn from your account.  Again- this is a commitment, a dedication, and a way of life and not suited for everybody.\n\nI personally love the east location because it's way less volume than the other Chuze gyms in town.  I started at the central location and worked my way over here when I realized I was more comfortable to do my workout routines with less people around.  I personally like that the staff stays out of your way but I am not everybody- I can only speak for myself.\n\nI hope that you do give Chuze fitness another try, as they are a remarkable gym that has the potential of bringing a healthy lifestyle to people at a reasonable price.  The unlimited hydromassage and tanning are an extra bonus (although i really wish they would bring the standup booth to this location...)\n\nI have been and will continue to be a loyal Chuze customer for many many years to come.",

  "text": "I've been going here for almost a year now. It's an excellent facility and probably the only luxurious club in the South Jersey area. The workout area is great. Aside from the traditional workout equipment (dumbbells, benches, machines, squat racks etc.) there are also a variety of other equipment  such as TRX, ropes, rowing machines, tires, punching bags etc. so you can do a variety of workouts. There's also a ton of squat racks, which is great cause most gyms only have about 2-3. So if you're squatting or deadlifting, it's easier to get a rack (unless there's a class going on). \n\nThey offer a variety of classes all day, which is great if you're more of a class type. Within each class type, there are also different varieties. For example, there are about 4/5 different yoga classes offered (heated, surrender, root etc.) Different kinds of classes offered are yoga, spin, Pilates, cardio circuit classes (HIIT), kickboxing, kettleball, TRX, weight training etc. The majority of the classes are included with your membership but there are a couple that you'll have to pay extra for. You can also work with a personal trainer, which you'll have to pay extra for. \n\nThe locker rooms are great and spacious. There is a sauna and steam room both in the locker room. They have complimentary towels, hair dryer, lotion, razors, shaving cream, mouthwash, body wash, shampoo and conditioner in the locker room so you don't need to worry about bringing any of that. There's both an indoor and outdoor pool with a hot tub as well. The outdoor pool can get pretty crowded during the summer time. The cafe is pretty  nice too. They have a lot of healthy food options and good protein shakes. Highly recommend the almond butter shake!! There's also a spa, barber and different massage services offered.\n\n\nOverall, this is a great gym. There a lot of amenities, classes, and equipment offered that most gyms do not have. It is obviously on the pricier end ($100 a month), but you get what you pay for. The only criticism I have is spacing and the weight room area. The middle jungle gym area can get crowded at times with all the equipment. It would have been nice if it was a little bigger and spread out. Also, the dumbbell rack area can be crowded at times due to lack of dumbbells and benches. I came from LA Fitness before and they have dumbbells in 2.5lb intervals all the way up to 55lb, but Lifetime only has 2.5lb intervals up to 30lbs.",

I've had questions regarding vitamins, classes, and other questions regarding the gym in general.The gals up front always has the answer or goes and retrieves the answer. \n\nPersonal Trainer:\nI have a PT, Kelsey, she is such a delight to work with. She ensures she not only \"coaches\" but teaches you how to stay fit and get strong. She listens to the clients, and works around their needs. She ensures the individual is correctly conducting exercises. She is consistent with pushing you to the limit, but always accounts for your strength and weaknesses. She ensures the works outs are not stagnant. Overall, she is  one of the greatest PT's I've ever had. \n\nClassroom Fitness Instructors:\nI've attended many different classes; with different instructors. The mass majority want to see you, the individual, succeed. The instructors strive to get to know each individual, especially when you become a regular. \n\n\nPrices:\n\nThe price is congruent to other gym memberships in the area. \n\n\nLocation:\nMeridian  \n\n\n\nParking / Venue: \nPlenty of parking! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar rating:\n4 out of 5\n\n\nMore importantly Would we ever go back? \n\nHaha!

  "text": "I went there yesterday for a simple tour as I've recently moved to this side of Tucson and Chuze is now too far to make my weekly spin classes on time. The receptionist was very friendly and tried his hardest to get the quote on quote \"gm\" to come give us a tour. After 15 minutes the \"gm\" arrived sweaty with a completely soaked shirt as if he just got out of the shower or was working out on the clock. \n\nHe then proceeded to tell us about the options in membership and didn't even offer a tour until I said I wanted one. This made it abundantly clear that we were being an inconvenience to him. \n\nHe didn't discuss many of the options and I kept having to pry for more information. For someone who is a sales person you think he would have tried to engage with us a little more. \n\nHe had little to no information on the spin class as that was my main reason for being there. \n\nHe then took us directly back to the sales pitch where he discussed the options for signing up not even allowing us to think about it. I told him I had a membership already and wanted to wait until June. He said, \" I wasn't the only one with double membership and this was the best deal they offer\". It wasn't and isn't. I already knew there was an offer for 20% a membership online. \n\nUgh, I told him we would ask for him when we came back because I know they work off of how many sales they get and need to keep their quota. He got extremely defensive and asked me \"who told you that!\" I simply said I used to work sales and I know how this goes.\n\n My boyfriend being kinder then myself signed up for a family membership (which is completely our fault as we should have just done the individual for me). This guy was a grease ball. He claimed to be giving us extra materials like lanyards, towels, a book. The book was used and had someone else's name written in it. \n\nBottle line: we were swindled, felt like inconveniences, and no-genuine interest given to us. I'll be trying the spin classes for the free 7 days then making my decision. The sales tactics need new perspective. I would have felt better if someone showed more interest in my becoming a member then the just a sales pitch opportunity.",

  "text": "No judgement free circuit zones for me.  I have a FREE gym membership with my job, but a one hour trip to the gym, turns into 2 because I have to wait for machines... Spent two weeks in the Charlotte area and was a guest of a member at the area locations.  I fell in love with the order and convenience of the 30/12 minute circuit program and the customer service.  Returned to New Orleans and joined...  Service- 2-3 ppl behind the counter looking down.  Circuit- 30/12 minute areas used as personal gym, when I attempt to get to the next station (in order), the other members get irritated or will not move, they will not wipe down machine because they are annoyed. The time I spend walking to the counter for the staff/manager to say, our policy is... (NOT OUR PROBLEM), we have to stay at the counter... is using up my gym time.  Then they share that everyone complains about it... and another member curses out members who do not move (put him on the payroll and I will schedule time with him!).  There is a white board that states a policy, they CHOOSE not to enforce. I even started attempting to find you a solution; guess what you have camera's in those areas????  You can monitor from the counter. I joined because of the 24 hr circuit availability and the service I received in Charlotte. One FB post, 3 conversations with staff and 2 suggestion box submissions later, I had to cancel my membership.  I guess you have enough members.  What really annoys me is, I recommended PF circuits to about 50 ppl when I returned... I am so embarrassed.  If everyone says the program is broken, get rid of it; continuing to market something you cannot manage is false advertising.  Throw out the red/green light and white board that says you will ask someone to leave or cancel their membership.  I really do cancelling my membership but I cannot to take my quality time to manage your members or program. Such a great unmanageable concept....\n\nOUTSTANDING SERVICE BY THE REGIONAL MANAGER- Verushka Lagos!!!! FIVE STARS FOR HER RESPONSIVENESS!!!  You need to find 20 more of her!  I may return once I move..",

  "text": "This is a 3.5 star place, but it's new so I rounded up. \n\nSo I decided to give this place a try because I love boxing and I've taken classes all over the city. They start counting down ten minutes before and it's a very audible countdown. Then they begin by showing you all the punches. Followed by quickly paced calisthenics to warm up with lungs, pushups, and the like. After that they give you a few combos to start and as the time in the round goes on they add additional combos. During my class, people were going around with mitts and people were doing one-on-one combos for a few seconds which I liked. At the end we did abs for ten minutes and cooled down. \n\nPros:\n- one-on-one mini sessions\n- being able to see your punch score at the end of class\n- the difficulty of the combos \n- instructors seemed like real boxers \n- good for beginners\n\nCons:\n- The music during my class was really generic and that really did not get me in the mood to do the class which was a huge miss on their part. \n- lack of jump rope component \n- no complimentary towels\n- a bit gimmicky with the constant \"how are y'all doing tonight\" call and responses \n\nAdditional things to note:\n- you are working out in an all glass gym right on the corner of market and 21st. People can see you from the street so if you want to be hidden, choose a bag that more towards to back and the middle. \n\n- bring your own lock for the lockers. They are right out in the open, but you never know. \n\n- they have gloves and wraps. Not sure if you can rent them, but you can buy and if you plan on boxing at all in the future, I'd highly recommend buying. \n\n- plan on getting dressed before you come because there are only two bathrooms there.\n\nAll in all, great new addition to the center city work out circuit. Looking forward to them finding their groove.",

The only time I've ever had to wait for equipment is during NY resolution season, but that's always short-lived.  I don't shower there, but there's a steam room and suana that I appreciate.  My favorite part of PSC is that the staff, and specifically the management, is so wonderful to deal with (which is extremelly rare when dealing with gyms).

  "text": "One of the best spin/high intensity fitness studios I've found.\n\nI travel a decent bit for work, so I'm always looking for a great, locally-owned group fitness studio in different cities. And when you come to Nashville - where the superb Southern cuisine is not shy on calories - finding a great work out is clutch. Tylt offers the best spin equipment in the game - the bike actually rotates right and left (simulating a real road bike), and works both your balance and core strength/stability.\n\nOff the bike, there is circuit training involving a blend of free weights, mats, resistance bands, and TRX. You rotate stations (7-8 min per) until you hit all of them.\n\nFinally, Paige is a rockstar instructor/hype girl. She clearly knows what she's doing, isn't short on enthusiasm, and delivers one hell of a workout. Added perk for Yelp users - if you check in, they add a class to your account.",

  "text": "For some reason, I can't stand this place.  Let's not even get into the complexities of canceling your membership.\n\nOne problem here is hours.  They close VERY early on weekends, and close relatively early on the weeknights.  They open at the crack of dawn.  This isn't helpful to most people, like myself, who'd prefer to work out in the evenings.  They're obviously doing the typical downtown thing and trying to make workers happy, while giving residents a fairly intense screwjob.  I'm used to gyms with late night hours in major cities.\n\nHere's some tips.  And this comes from a customer, not somebody who knows anything about running a gym:  for one, expand your hours.  It's not that hard.  Two, encourage people to take care of the machines.  In general, many St. Louisans tend to not understand communal situations like gyms where your mother isn't there to clean up after you.  I don't enjoy getting on a cardio machine and having to spend 5 minutes (while I'm already rushed due to the early closing time) wiping some douchebag's drool, spittle, and sweat off the machine.",

I love that I get a good workout in but also don't end up overly sore that I can't even move the next day. In the 8 months, every session has been different, nothing is ever repetitive and it keeps me engaged more than if it was the same cycle of workouts but heavier weights. He motivates me to also eat well and make sure to get cardio in when I can. I am more toned, fit and motivated to keep up my good work throughout the day after a session!

I wish I had a more predictable schedule so I could regularly attend Zumba and Cardio Hip Hop, as my experiences with both of these classes thus far have been quite positive. The instructors are enthusiastic and encouraging, music selection is great, and I walk out of class definitely having gotten my money's worth in terms of the workout. I've attended classes both at their South Street location and their new pop-up in Nest and found both of the spaces to be adequate, lots of mirrors which is key when you're trying to keep straight what direction you're supposed to be going in.

There is also a modest free weight area if you wanted to get a lift in before or after training. The vibe isn't one of dominance or arrogance either. Everyone is there to learn, train, and have a good time. Jesse and all of the trainers are super nice and accommodating to everyone skill levels.

There are few down falls especially when you have to use the bathroom there is no privacy as you walk past the old ladies getting dress which there needs to be covered dressing area as young teenagers workout they don't need to see a nude old granny boobies and more \nThe equipment is ok not new they do there maintenance and up keep very well and very clean as I see the people always cleaning. \nThe most annoying is when there sales ppl walk around asking there own Customers to promote LA fitness business I'm paying a monthly bill why would I promote a business for free? It's bad business tactic especially you are making money off customers using your facility monthly. if anyone promotes it hopefully you get something in return this is a billion dollar company. \nThe Swift machine never has neck pads the personal trainer area keeps them if you ask they are rude as F about it I'm paying $$$ LA fitness should be offering  customers towels like some of the other local gyms. \nGood part is you are not fighting to use the equipment which is a plus.

  "text": "The experience at Krank is different from other spin classes you may have experienced. When you walk in you might be concerned that you've stumbled into a crossfit gym, don't worry, you're in the right place. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and greeted me immediately, handed me special spinning shoes and a fresh towel.They gave me a quick tour of the facilities and the instructor personally adjusted my seat height AND checked in with me after the class to see how I was feeling. \n\nI only have a minor complaint about the facility. The lockers are in a tiny hallway near the restroom. Personally, I get a little flustered with 15- 20 people trying to move in and out of a tiny hallway with their gym bags. I understand it's a small facility and they've done the best they can with the space. This is just to say that I really recommend getting there with some time to spare. That way you can avoid the hallway/locker smash up and have more time with the instructor, who is very eager to help! \n\nWhen class starts, the lights turn down and the music turns up. I got nervous when the instructor put on a microphone headset and told us to \"turn it up to ten\" while we pedaled our hearts out to Wipeout. \n\nThe instructor is enthusiastic and encouraging and does a wonderful job keeping you updated on the progress of the class. \"We are going to do x number of sprints now\" I find that knowing what the mini goal at hand is really helps stay motivated. The class had great energy. Towards the end you use dumbbells for 5-10 minutes, this gives a slight cardio/lower body recovery but I wouldn't say it's enough to consider an upper body workout. \n\nI've taken a spin class or two in the past but I found them tedious. Sure they burned calories but I found myself watching the clock. You can only \"sit. stand. Ok sit again\" so many times. I wasn't bored for a second at Krank. There were moments when I wondered how much longer...but not because I had mentally checked out. \n\nThis was one of the more intense workouts I've had in quite a while and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, even a spin newbie like myself.",

  "text": "Gym has gone downhill over the past year or so. I go there because there's not much of a choice of gyms nearby.\n\nAmong my beefs:\n(A) You used to see gym personnel cleaning equipment, and I once actually saw a guy cleaning the mats in the stretching area. Now, those mats are disgusting and I hardly see anyone cleaning the equipment or the locker room.\n\n(B) They recently purged all but three of their trainers, even the very good, experienced ones. Rumor has it they wanted everyone to go full time and most couldn't afford it (they pay the trainers crap and don't give health benefits, which adds to my not liking the place). I find this rumor hard to believe, though, because the three trainers they have don't seem to have many hours of training open. And of course,  when you only have three trainers, you know it'll be harder to line up a trainer at your convenience and if you don't like those three, tough luck.\n\n(C) Along the lines of personal training, there's a revolving door of personal training managers. I've been there almost since its opening and I don't think any of them have lasted longer than 6 months. Which leads to a total lack of continuity and stability.\n\n(D) Forget about any kind of interaction with the staff. If you were expecting friendly staff or people knowing your name because you're in there all the time, you won't get it. They barely look at you when they take your keys to swipe your card and hand it back to you. Maybe it's a small thing, but as the \"Cheers' theme song says, it's nice to go where everybody -- hell, ANYbody -- knows your name.\n\n(E) They often run out of paper towels out on the floor, so after you make the trek down there to find, surprise, surprise, there are none, you have to go back to the locker room to get one then go back to the paper towel dispensing area to put some cleaner on it so you can wipe down the equipment. And speaking of the cleaner, recently they were out of their usual clear stuff and put in some cloudy stuff that smelled like something they use on floors.\n\nThe good: It's close to home, the equipment is relatively new and maintenance is done on the equipment (unlike the old Lifestyles around the corner, where equipment fell apart and pieces peeled off the equipment). \n\nPlease, someone out there, open up a gym close to South Pasadena/Gulfport that is large enough to have multiple pieces of the same equipment, clean enough that members are  not grossed out, decent enough to your staff (including trainers) that members don't mind giving you their money, nice enough that members feel like the staff and management knows they're lucky to have our money... My suggestion: Model it after St. Anthony's fitness center in Carillon (oh, if only that were closer!).",

  "text": "This place is dead now. I go back and forth btw CT and FL so I come to this location when Im in Tampa. Everyone that used to be there has ran off to other gyms. First it was Lori who was a wonderful body conditioning instructor, I enjoyed her class ever Thursday morning but she ran off sometime last year when the gym managers gave her grief for her style of training Carmen is ok for pilates but a really trained pilates instructor with modern moves would be much better, PLUS having the adding more pilate class to the rooster would make more sense. I used to train with Damien, he's gone, most of the trainers I used to see flew the coop, even the font desk staff are all new and inexperienced. One of the machines was turned off, instead of checking to see if it was just not plugged in or anything, a \"need service\" sign was just immediately placed. No one wants to do anything. There are not enough barbells either and all they have are the curled ones, even Planet Fitness has a mix of straight and curled barbells, two of each for every weight starting from 20lb. Since Ive been back I haven't seen the 40lb barbell anywhere and thats for I normally use for my strength training, but that's what happens when you only have one option.\nI appreciate that they moved the location of the T-bar row, I no longer have to be around those trying to use the water fountain however the bar itself is more often than not no where to be found, which is really annoying, one would think at the end of the day staff would put things back the way they should be but that doesn't seem to be the case. There's only one flat leg curl machine for some reason, the seated leg curl doesn't do nearly as much for you as the flat one, there are also not enough weighted medicine balls to go around. There should be a set in the personal training room and a set for the general room. There should also be padded barbells for those who do hip thrusts with them or at least have padding around so we can add them ourselves. The fans for the treadmills are wonky, there should be fans on the stairclimber machines as well. Also there's not enough of the \"better\" treadmills to go around. They are only 4 clustered towards the right upstairs and 2 on the far left, the rest are subpar outdated ones.\nI mainly come here now because of how close it is to my apt however with Damien now gone, Crunch will now be a serious consideration.",

  "text": "This place is absolutely wonderful. Master Ray and his wife Ms. Lea along with every single one of their instructors are the absolute best with training these students. They all have such great patience. They are also very kind yet firm with the students. My grandson's self confidence has improved so much since he began coming here. He has goals & he understands that in order to achieve his goals it takes a lot of focus,self-discipline,practice, and hard work .The day he earned his green belt was one of his proudest moments as he knew how hard he worked for it. And most of all.....they stress values. Like honesty, integrity, and community service. \nI would recommend this studio for anyone who wants their child to get a good physical workout, learn martial arts and all the while having a great time. I can't thank this place enough for what they've taught my grandson.",

  "text": "This place is a godsend.  This review should only be read by avid climbers as I've never taken an intro or group class here.  You can skip to the section about the staff.\nI am an avid climber and have been climbing indoors in San Francisco prior to coming here.  Basically, I got spoiled and my expectations were low when I came here.  But I was wrong and I am so happy I was.\nThe walls are definitely high enough -- can't give you an exact height, but if you're leading on a top rope wall, you can clip on 6 times until you hit the top.\nIt's got a great bouldering cave, and plenty of changing routes on the top rope wall.  There is also a section specific to lead climbing with routes in the 5.7-5.10 range.  If I were to estimate # of routes and their setting for TOP ROPE ONLY -- 5.5 (1), 5.6 (3), 5.7 (6), 5.8 (7), 5.9 (6), 5.10(6), 5.11(3), 5.12 (1), 5.13 (1).  The ratings here are also much harder than what I was used to in San Francisco (meaning a 5.9 here is much harder than a West Coast 5.9).\nThe thing that sold me was the staff.  Mike the owner is an amazing guy and ultra friendly.  Suraj, Brett, and Chris are the employees that work there most often.  They have amazing climbing skills and hang out in the bouldering cave all the time.\nYou'll see a lot of regulars and everyone is really friendly.  I climb here regularly to top-rope, boulder, and lead with or without my own clips.  Unfortunately, I am moving due to work changes and I will have to find a new gym in NYC...",

  "text": "Crunch Fitness (Meridian, Idaho)\n\n\nWhen I'm traveling for work, I do what a lot of people do and that's to find the nearest gym. I found Crunch Fitness through Yelp. And to be honest, Crunch Fitness wasn't my go-to gym when I'm the area. But the gym I usually workout at closed their doors and the other gyms that I have memberships to were too far. I don't have a membership here so I can't give you an opinion on what it's like to be a member. What I can tell you is that this Crunch Fitness has some of the best old school equipment that's becoming rare to find at big box gyms. I usually pay $10 for a 24 hour pass. This may seem like a lot and it is considering that most monthly memberships are around $20. I'm all about stretching my funds and will typically get 3-4 workouts in a 24 hour period.  By far, this is my favorite gym in the Boise, Meridian, or the Eagle area. I highly recommend this gym if you're just in town a few days or if you're local.  \n\nPros:\n-I love the equipment. This gym still has some of the older Nautilus and Hammer Strength \n-Metal plates and bumper plates \n-One squat rack and two power racks. \n-Deadlift platform also available \n-Heavy steel dumbbells \n-2 Smith machines\n-2 cable stations \n-Enough cardio (dreadmills, bikes, & stair-monsters)\n-Seated barbell rack for pressing\n-Safety collars! No one steals them here. I didn't need to use my own.\n-Nice and polite members. \n-Very clean gym. There's always a staff member cleaning. \n-The Manager and staff treat me like I'm a regular \n\nCons:\n-Tight dumbbell and bench area\n-Only one flat, incline, and decline bench. Good luck on Monday aka International Chest Day\n-Missing a Lying Leg Curl machine. Or, did I miss it?\n-Not enough equipment for calves.",

  "text": "It was my Husband's Birthday so I wanted to treat him to a nice dinner somewhere. I had always heard Mr John's was better than Ruth's Chris (which is where we usually go) and wanted to dine there.\n\nRecently, Mr John' s advertised a Groupon and I bought it.  I made our dinner reservation through Open Table.  I had left a message on the answer machine at Mr John's but no one returned my call.\n\nWe arrived at Mr John's for our 6pm reservation. We were seated at the very first table upon entering the dining room. I was not happy with this table, it appeared to be a busy traffic area, near the kitchen entrance. There were several empty tables (at least 8) in the room but when I asked the hostess for a different table she said the other tables had been reserved. We sat at our assigned table and dealt with the high foot traffic going by the table.\n\nThe waiter staff were great, very attentive. We started with a bottle of red wine, we enjoyed this wine having visited the winery recently in CA and knowing the winemaker as a past physician I worked with. My husband ordered the turtle soup and I had the wedge salad, both were very good. We both ordered the filet's. I would have given the restaurant a 5 star except they switched the steaks. I like rare and my husband likes his steak medium rare. I don't think they knew they made a mistake?\n\nI had called Mr John's just before leaving home for the restaurant to ask if they did anything special for Birthday's. I alerted them it was my husband's birthday.  We ordered creme brûlée for dessert.  Either the message was not passed on to our waiter or he forgot to recognize the birthday.  The creme brûlée was good, but my husbands birthday was overlooked.\n\nIt was about 7:20 pm when we were finishing up with the bill.  I looked around the dining room once again before leaving, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  More people had arrived but noticed there were 3 tables by the front windows that were still empty.  I wondered if we were seated based on having a Groupon???  Our table was in a busy noisy traffic area!\n\nAlthough I would recommend this restaurant and would like to return, I was a little disappointed in how the evening turned out. It was important to me but seemed insignificant to them. I have to agree with my friend that said Mr John's is slightly better than Ruth's Chris.",

  "text": "I've been climbing here regularly for a few months. I've also brought friends and relatives here for fun day-trips. The atmosphere here is great! The staff are friendly and helpful, and all of the regulars seem super chill and nice.\n\nThere is a top-roping section, a lead-climbing section, and a bouldering section. Like the other reviewers have been saying, it's a little smaller than the average climbing gym, but they still have plenty of space and interesting routes to try out. They are also apparently expanding the size of their gym in March 2017, which we are all excited about.\n\nSometimes it gets busy on weekends during peak children's birthday party hours (12-4). But I've never had a problem with the kids-- the staff keeps them well in-hand. And if it ever feels too crowded in the top-roping section, you can always just climb in the bouldering section, which the kids never use.\n\nThe only frustrating experience I've had here involved an over-billing issue. It took a good while for them to put me in contact with the correct billing manager, and it still took some time after that to get the issue resolved. However, this is the only negative interaction I've had with the place, so it was probably just a one-off.\n\nAll in all, I think this gym is great both for beginners looking for a fun one-time activity or for long-time climbers looking for a permanent gym.",

Supposedly this is what the members asked for, well they didn't ask me. And they won't give out guest passes. \n$30/adult and $15/kid for guests from May1-Nov.1. Conveniently they put this policy into effect after we signed up for a year. The lady had assured me I could drop the kids off the membership in the colder months and just bring them as guests when I wanted to(up to 3 times a month). But now I'd have to pay every time I brought them or add them back in. \nMore cons: the pool is frequently closed due to diaper accidents. \nThe chlorine hurts my kids eyes and hair so much they are scared to swim here. \nVery limited classes offered. Only 1 or 2 decent spin instructors.",

This location is the largest of all of theirs and has a steam room / sauna.  It may very well be their flagship location.\n2. Cheap. Did I mention I pay like a bit over $10/month?\n3. Location. Right off of 270 Hwy & Olive Street. Easy access.\n4. Ample parking.\n5. Looks like lots of classes and a juice bar... neither which I use.\n\nBad:\n1. Can someone please tell me why none of the weights (plates or barbells) are racked in the right places, or in many cases, not racked at all?  This is the biggest pain in the ass.\n2. How come at all the other Club Fitness gyms, there are television units integrated in the treadmills and the stair-climbers? At this location, the tvs are on the wall, you cannot change channels, and the sound is spotty.\n3. Dirty. Seriously, an old wash rag and unlabeled disinfectant manual spray bottle at some stations? Last I saw at other clubs, they had paper towel dispensers and disinfectant foam which is more hygienic.\n4. Hours. They made me buy a new  $10 swipe card claiming \"24 hour access\".  This failed.  They are no longer \"24 hours\" open. What a waste. Don't bother coming at 6 or 7 am Sunday morning because they are closed.\n5. Free weights and equipment too close together.\n6. No towel service.\n\nSo this is my review.  I think the biggest annoyance from above is the weights not being racked and the barbells in the totally wrong place. Hygiene is next biggest problem.",

I was very surprised by that comment and started looking around only to find that compared to my old gym, the place was pretty dead. Please note that I did come in around 9:30am and for good reasons. I was trying to avoid the crowd but as it turns out, this place is hardly ever crowded during the times I like to go. They have newer equipments here and there's always a cardio machine available no matter when you come in. I have been here after work and after dinner (around 6 or 7pm) andstill found a machine away from other people on cardio days. \n\nI did talk to the person working up front when I signed up about the classes and the membership does come with 5 free sessions and then you have to pay for the rest if you would like to continue. There is also a card for free aquatic class when you sign up. They have toddler services as well but I told her I did not need it and that I would rather get something else so she offered the aquatic class card. There is also a free guest pass when you sign up. I haven't had the chance to try out any of their classes yet but I was thinking of trying out spinning one of these days.\n\nThe locker room is pretty nice. It smells quite a bit like chlorine because of the pool but I don't mind.  There is a sauna and a hot tub but I haven't used either yet. As far as the fitness center goes, I really like this place. Last but not least, this is a very economical gym especially if you are a Brentwood, Maplewood or Richmond Heights resident!",

The employees are mostly friendly but not overly friendly. I love all the options it has to work out. I love the free massage chairs for after my work out. Parking is a pain and is not very convenient.  Overall, I enjoy it and will continue to come to this gym during off hours.",

  "text": "Do yourself a favor and try out a free class.  You'll temporarily hate your life but afterwards I PROMISE you'll be hooked!  I'll admit, I was scared at first.  Group fitness? Special heart rate monitors? EVERYONE can see how hard (or not hard) I'm working on the screen? I wasn't thrilled but I knew this was the push I needed to step up my workout game.\n\nI've been attending OTF Ironworks for two weeks now and have been incredibly pleased with the facility, workouts, coaches and every single staff member I've interacted with.  These workouts will challenge you, make you question why you even signed up in the first place and by the middle of class you've probably convinced yourself that you're never coming back.  But then... you finish the workout with a group of amazing people encouraging you along the way and you leave feeling accomplished in the end. Totally worth it! \n\nNo two workouts are the same and each coach brings a different energy to the class.  The music is blaring, everyone is working hard and you're likely burning 500+ calories each time! Classes range from 5am to 8pm, so you really have no excuse to not attend.  The workout is split between the treadmill, rowers and weight station for a full 60 minute workout.  Throughout your workout, you are able to quickly glance at the TVs located around the room to see what zone you're in (how hard you're working.)  If you notice everyone else in class has reached the next zone, it's time for a little self evaluation.  Talk about motivation!  \n\nThere are several different memberships available for OTF, ranging from Basic to Premier - so you are able to select the package that best fits your lifestyle.  There are transformation challenges that offer cash prizes, raffles and even a Facebook group to keep members connected and engaged.  Absolutely love everything about OTF and recommend to all!",

  "text": "The Best Workout in Tampa! True Grit is a major motivational experience! I needed this boost and change in my personal routine. I was greeted by one of the owners as I signed in. There were several members of the gym. It was great that the regulars there are so friendly and inviting, a couple immediately introduced themselves to me and asked me to partners up with them! The owners were great at demonstrating the workouts for newbies before we got started and although the work out was a challenge they made it fun by playing up beat music and walking around pushing everyone with motivational words! This is a great gym and awesome workout! They also have some monthly challenges I believe such as \"mission slimpossible\" and maybe a social gathering occasionally. On a side note, Love that this is a family business and they are clearly well respected. They were throwing a birthday party for their Son after the boot camp and invited everyone to join. Most everyone stayed and sang. Im pretty sure every person even brought the little birthday guy a gift! Wow, that's cool!",

However, it gives off a weird aura about it that just doesn't tickle me the right way. I know, I know. That's unfair Mark. Sure. It just feels like I have to rent out the stinky shoes each time I go unless I buy my own pair to use. Pretty sure I could use any sneaker I wanted to in So.Flo. Other than my own strange fickleness about the shoes, this place is pretty cool. The boulder for free climbing is pretty fun. They have a wall dedicated to free wall climbing and another for belayed climbing. They also have a tight rope and some pull up thingies to work out with if you're not feeling like hitting the \"rocks\". The venue is a bit smaller in comparison to what I've experienced though serviceable. I generally enjoy my visits despite the quirks that might nag me a little.",

Solid music and low lighting- cakewalk. \n\nThis was NOTHING like cruising on a bike with a basket filled with groceries. This was INTENSE. I conned my husband into going with me early on a Sunday morning because there was no shot I was going by myself. We get there and it's amazingly clean and even at 8:00 am the staff was welcoming and helpful. Our cubby had our shoes in it and there are free lockers with electronic locks. It's super easy. We popped on our shoes, filled up our water bottles and grabbed the towels we would need to wipe down our sweaty selves. \n\nYou go into this beautiful studio that could double as a night club (if you removed the bikes) and find your pre-picked bike- ours were in the back. lol.\nThe instructor and assistants help you on to the bike and it takes some getting used to having your feet locked into the peddles but that goes away. We got started with some Britney (my fave) and we were off to the races! I was sweating within 5 minutes! We did hills and and sprints and everything in between! Even did arms with weights! This is an incredible workout! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to sweat like crazy!",

  "text": "So, I started to frequent this location of LA Fitness a couple of weeks ago as it is about the same distance from my house as the other location I have frequented for the past 4 years.  I chose to try this out as I pass it often and it is one of the newly acquired Lifestyles gyms.  I figured why not give it a try.\n\nThe one difference I have noted on each visit is that the front desk staff at this gym seems to be so much more professional, friendly, and talkative.  I don't know if this is because they remained from the Lifestyles merger or were trained differently than the LA Fitness folks.  The overall appearance and cleanliness of this gym is so vastly better than the North Dale Mabry LA Fitness location.  There seem to be cleaning supplies readily available and the equipment also seems to be newwer and better maintained.  I have yet to find equipment in this gym not in working order or with an out of order sign at this location.\n\nAnother worthy mention is that each piece of cardio equipment has it's own TV.  This is so much of a godsend as the North Dale Mabry location only carries every news channel or infomercial channel on their 4 TVs for the entire gym.  Albeit that the channel selection is limited, it is still better to be able to watch what you want and not be forced to watch whatever the gym had selected for it's tvs for the entire day.  \n\nAll in all, this location is a much needed improvement over the North Dale Mabry location.  I think this location seems to be a hidden gem as there are hardly ever crowds when I frequent it, which is vastly different from the other location that is packed no matter what time of the day you go.",

We did not stick with it for long. \n\nLA Fitness was HUGE, always INSANELY BUSY, and really stuffy.  For all the money they took from me, why couldn't I get some damn AC?

I love that they offer free childcare. \n\nUnfortunately, the actual workout room feels small to me. I'm used to weight-machine OPTIONS, people. I'm used to so many elliptical machines, I don't have to work out next to ANYONE. Oh well. It adds the community vibe, in a way.\n\nAvoid Saturday mornings and after 6 pm weekdays -- too busy.

I have visited 2 locations and have found it a great environment. Even for a heavier, older woman. Smiles are everywhere and cleanliness is very apparent. I have been at all times of the day and there is always something to do. The aqua classes are fun and my husband has even enjoyed them! I met with a trainer, Andrea and she was great. Again listened and gave great advice. I am glad to be on my journey with this gym!",

Even as a past rower the workout are totally killer, you spend time on and off of the rowing machine, usually a few sets of each.  The rower gives you a great cardio workout and during the 'off' time you work on lifting - sometimes focusing on a particular body part like leg day or arm day - and the combination makes me feel like I got a great total workout in only 45 minutes! The on and off intervals also make the class time fly by which is a huge plus! Every time I've gone the energy has been high and the classes have been tons of fun so its super motivating as well! \nIn sum if you're looking for a really great total body workout that is fun too you need to try this place out!

The layout can be confusing at first (it looks to have been converted from an old set of homes), but you can become acclimated once you get your routine down.  \n\nThe owner was thoughtful in planning out the gym's offerings. There is tons of cardio equipment and a variety of classes (spinning, yoga, fitness, lifting).  There are express workout areas, a pool, a sun deck, and it is attached to the Camac Center (tanning, massage, other services).  In the six or seven months that I have been going, I have no complaints.  \n\nBottom line: If you can get a reduced price ($30/mo) it's worth it if you live or work in the area.",

  "text": "Note: pictures posted DO NOT reflect their renovations. The location is much more cramped/small compared to the many pictures shown. To disagree with another commenter, the pictures do lie in this case. They're outdated. \n\nThis Snap used to be awesome, but has been average at best since they remodeled. When I originally signed up, the Snap occupied 5 suites in its building - after renovating, it only occupies 3 suites. Same amount equipment, but now it's all mashed together with limited space to exercise. Additionally, they did not lower the membership cost after shrinking the size of the complex by 40%. That's inexcusable, imo. But to my dismay, they're convenient for me so I tolerate it. \n\nMy biggest complaint is related to the equipment layout. The mirrors are not full-length (do not reach the floor) in the main weight area. Additionally, the squat rack and smith machine are not lined up appropriately with the mirrors, so you end up with a distorted view of your body while lifting. When I approached Amanda (the manager) about it, she suggested that I spend more time exercising and less time posing in the mirror. This was a laughable dig, and I reminded her that the mirrors are tools used to watch form. My comments/complaints were shared by several other people, but no changes were made to the layout. I have since accepted that I'll have to go elsewhere to squat safely because Snap does not care about my safety. In most other local gyms (like the Zoo in Kenner, St. Charles Ave. Athletic Club, French Riviera Fitness), the squat rack and smith machines are practically surrounded by mirrors providing you with a nearly 360 degree view of yourself while exercising. This is generally the standard, but one this Snap has chosen to ignore. \n\nPros: month to month membership without cancellation fees, safe parking area, inexpensive membership (though it should be lower considering their rent/lease expenses cannot possibly be as high since renovating), 24-hr access, decent/average assortment of equipment. \n\nCons: no amenities, drink machine does not take credit/debit cards, poor mirror setup, no stairstepper, no locker room, bathrooms aren't well maintained, impossibly crowded sometimes, very poor gym etiquette by members, poor customer service.",

Flash forward a year and I'm doing the Brik Boot Camp again.  I mainly attend class at the West location but I have tried East and the Midtown location as well. The workouts have a lot of variety and all of the instructors are awesome!  I'm hoping someday they'll offer the dance workout class at the West location because it was my favorite class thus far.  I still don't like doing planks and Burpee's (does anyone?) but slowly but surely I'm getting stronger.  What I like the most about Kaia is that every week there are several different classes to attend -the normal work out, the dance workout, yoga and the TRX suspension.  As they say variety is the spice of life!  If you're looking to lose those stubborn pounds and inches this is the place to get results!",

He understands me, can anticipate my needs, and even provides helpful tips for the days when I just can't decide what to do. \n\nHis name is Netflix. \n\nAnd while Netflix is sweet and very caring, he is also very addictive. It's turning into a very unhealthy relationship that I just can't seem to get out of by myself. I'm spending all my free time with him, blowing off social events to click his buttons, and even using him as an excuse to not workout. \n\nEnter Hotbox. The best breakup tool any girl could have. Though I've only been to one class, I have to say I can already feel myself getting pumped up to go back! I'm so ADD that running just doesn't cut it for me. And I'm too stubborn to workout by myself because I just won't do it if I don't want to. I needed to find a place where everyone is there for the same reason: to get pushed to their limit and sweat their asses off. I can already tell that this gym is a COMMUNITY. A safe space where you can go and give this intense calorie-burning workout 100% of your most hardcore effort, and probably look like a complete dork while doing it - but no one cares because NO ONE IS LOOKING AT YOU. \n\nI am so happy that I found this gym so I can start becoming the Best Version of Me. \nThank you Hotbox!",

Classes are great, kids sports leagues are great, there is a pool on the second floor and the equipment works.

I have tried and done so many things to NOT hate it but I do and Pure Barre in Carmel was no exception to this rule for me.  I almost left the class early b/c I was annoyed. It wasn't anything they did.  It was just not for me.  It was a \"feel the burn\" class but not too difficult and I should have probably felt amazing after but I didn't. I just felt \"over it\" and didn't have any desire to return. The women running the class were nice, pleasant and welcoming. I wasn't intimidated or felt out of place.  I just WAS out of place. I cannot possibly give my experience 5 stars b/c ....well it just wasn't.  \n\nIn addition, it's overpriced but almost everything \"class\" based is so I'm not surprised.  It's just definitely not happening for me at the price point.  For me it was just OK but I'm sure for those who love this type of work out and can afford the monthly fee, it's wonderful.",

They then told me I would have to come in for a refund. Why would I need to do that when I didn't come in for you to take it! I never had problems like this in my previous MI Planet fitness and regret transferring to this one. On another note they also have been missing dumbbells in the stretch room for the last year.

  "text": "This review is specifically for the kick ass \"Zumba\" instructor Ruben I had this morning not for the facility although I will note a few things... \n\n5 stars for sauna, boxing ring, elliptical availability and parking in the city. \n\n5 stars for the awesome kiddie care staff -2 stars for it being on closed randomly on Tuesdays. \n\n1 star for the either the super pushy personal trainers or lack of staff all together. There's no in between. \n\n1 star for lack of yoga classes. \n\nOk, end rant. \n\nTo the good stuff! This morning I happened to look over at a class already in progress as I lifted. It looked SO intriguing. See, I swore off Zumba a few years back when it was first popular. The instructors, clad in blinding neon was basically yelling directions, doing moves that were short and made no sense as they were bouncing all over the place. I HATED every minute of it. I tried it a few other times, 5 or 6 different instructors in fact, and it was just people with no dance background trying to teach a type of dance. It was awful!!! AWFUL! It was boring. It was old school aerobics with grapevines and cha cha galore. Too much latin music. In every class. I swore this stuff wasn't for me, a former dancer and that was a shame because I love to dance. This wasn't dance. Zumba is not dance. I thought it would've been more dance, less robotics and more fun. I never thought I could possibly like this type of class ever again. I was wrong and it has everything to do with the instructor this morning....\n\nHe was buff, stylish, wore a newsboy hat the ENTIRE class and knew what he was doing! No question. As a former classically trained dancer, I can smell talent and passion for dance a mile away. I loved every single minute of this!!! It is honestly one of the best things (beside the obvious family and house etc.) that has happened to me in my adult years. It took me back to my dancing days with kick ball changes, box steps and more! So freaking fun! He has incredible musicality and attitude. The choreography was amazing!!!! He didn't miss an opportunity to perfectly match each beat, note and lyric with the appropriate movement. The music was a mix of popular tunes you can sing along to, empowering songs, theatrical jazz, even Native American sounds, Hip Hop, some Latin songs, (but not too many) and even a big lovely, relaxing finale. \n\nThe class was filled with everyone... older ladies, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, beafy men, out of shape, in shape, newbies. You name it. It was truly a thing of beauty. \n\nThe class was the perfect blend of the workout necessity like squats and leg lifts, waist trimmers, even boxing, mixed with a good amount of Latin flare, a little hip hop 'tude mixed with some Broadway type theatrics. Even the cool down was dramatic with big hand and head motions. Awesome!! \n\nI actually stood there afterwards wanting more. That's not to be confused with it not being a complete kick ass workout because it so was!! It was just THAT good!!! I cannot get enough of this class! You MUST try it! \n\nDare I say I'm going to be a regular?! At \"Zumba\"? I really don't even want to call it that. This guy is a game changer. In fact, I think they just have to label it \"Zumba\" as this class doesn't fit into any one category. He's so unique and different than any other \"Zumba\" class I've tried. It's sooooo good and very different than what I've seen labeled as \"Zumba\". If you too have sworn off Zumba and you actually like to dance and can, give Ruben's class a go!! \n\nThis class is an absolute blast! So much so that I followed him to another gym! The best way to burn 900 calories in an hour! Yeah baby!!!\n\nUpdate: There was a Zumba sub for Ruben today. I walked out. It was awful!!!! Still loathe \"Zumba\". Still obsessed with Ruben! Try him! You will love him! Everybody does!\n\nUpdate 2: Won't  even walk in when I know he's not there. Not worth the time.",

Because I\"m a hoity-toity black card member I get the benefits of $1 drinks and since I get a water (24oz thank you!) every visit the extra $10/month evens out nicely as non-black card members are charged double.  My membership also includes an unlimited guest pass, free tanning, massage chair and the ability to visit any PF around the country.  Word, me likey.  \n\nOkay so I am sooo not in shape, nor do I claim to actually know what I'm doing at the gym but this place is pretty easy and it's helping me to enjoy exercise.  Every weight machine has instructions and the cardio machines are pretty self-explanatory.  There are like eight billion cardio machines, mostly ellipticals and treadmills, 9 televisions that  cardio machines hook into via your headphones, a circuit training area, free weights and a stretching area.  They don't have classes but they do offer a trainer to set up a regimen for you. \n\nLocker rooms include lockers, showers, changing areas and bathrooms, bring your own lock.  The staff are quite nice, though I think few of them are knowledgeable about fitness.  My one gripe is that since I joined during a crazy promotion I was never actually given a gym tour.  It left me feeling scared and afraid on my first day but the other members are laid back enough that my fears quickly faded.  And really for $19.99/month I can't complain at all.",

The new rec is not meant to just be a gym but a place to study and hang out, promoting that healthy active lifestyle I never seem to achieve. \n\nCrowds, ok yes being the UA gym it can get packed but opening to about 9am is pretty tolerable as well as 9-10pm. Be prepared to ask some of the meatheads if you can work into a machine, cus some can bench press all day long...

  "text": "Evoke is a great gym here in Reno that I highly recommend anybody looking for a gym give a look. Evoke is a wonderful place to go for anybody of any fitness level. I am usually intimidated by going to the gym because there are usually the \"Super Bro\" type person who is there to grunt loudly, show everybody how strong they are and throw weights around. This isn't like that. Evoke has a wide variety of services, from group training (10-20 people) to fitness boot camp/challenge type classes (30 days long with a pre test and post test as well as an event awards dinner at the end) to personal training to pilates to crossfit to bikini/fitness/physique training and so much more. \n\nThey are able to do this with the help of some wonderful trainers that are incredibly knowledgable and motivating. From making sure you maintain the proper form to helping you make sure your diet is complimenting the work you are doing, Evoke's trainers are some of the best in Reno. \n\nTrainers are only a part of the equation though. The people who attend classes at evoke are some great people who are really friendly. There are usually people of varying fitness levels so finding someone to partner with or pace yourself with is easy. People here also are attentive, helping to motivate me when I need it, compliment and cheer when it is deserved as well as give me a call or text if I miss a class I said I'd be at. Ultimately, these are the people who help make Evoke as great as it is. You feel like you are a part of a big, fun, friendly family when you are here. \n\nI've been doing their fitness challenges for the last couple months and have really seen some great results with the help of trainers who keep things fun and interesting while motivating me to do my best and my fellow attendees and challengers helping push me and making sure I show up. If you are looking for a great place to start or continue your fitness journey, I highly recommend you give Evoke a try.",

Despite the fact that this place is new and clean and fancy looking, it lacks a lot of the important stuff.\n\nThis particular gym is small, very small, Tiny people! There is no room to do personal workouts. So if you are looking for a room with a mirrored wall like most gyms have so that you can get a bit of privacy, you will not find that here. \n\nIt does have a good amount of treadmills, bikes, elliptical machines but when it comes to the machine workouts on the floor there is seriously like 20 machines that is it. Probably not even that many, i could be exaggerating. There are not many free weights, and when you do get your hands on some you will be touching elbows with the person next to you. \n\nI like my elbow room and air space when I work out.\n\nI do like that this is a 24 hour locations, The people here are also very friendly and nice. The parking is interesting since you park in a parking garage and walk over.

I didn't climb but my husband and four-year-old son did. They rented harnesses and shoes. \nIt was our first time, we came all the way across town and it was worth it. It is nice to have something active and indoor for kids, especially with the Tucson summer heat. \nBecause it was our first time we filled out our waivers and Amelia gave my son and husband an introduction. My son loved her. He really paid attention to the instructions and learned how to fall correctly. \nOne nice feature of rock solid is everything is color coded and spaced well. This makes it easier to give instructions to smaller kids. Although I wasn't climbing, there were plenty of nice benches and lounge areas to watch from. \nOverall, we enjoyed our time at Rock Solid. We purchased a gift card for a friend, and we will be back.",

I've been going since they opened in early January and it's been adequate until a few days had passed. First of all, anytime I want to call about a pressing matter I can never get in touch with a live person. There also been an ongoing issue that there's no hot water. Anytime I finish my workout, it's crucial that I take a shower because I have work right after and I cannot let myself look like a lunatic. My parents are paying a hefty family rate and it's not fair for them to be paying when our needs as a family aren't met. Even when I've called and was lucky to have someone to converse with, they simply say \"we're working on it\". \n\nConsidering this is a new facility, I had astronomically high expectations. But sadly, they've gone down quickly. \n\nUpdate 2/13/19: Well, they still have no hot water. I'm changing my membership for Crunch. They have a sauna and you guessed it -- hot water.",

Why?\n\nThe good:\n- Clean gym\n- Never overcrowded\n- Never took any classes, so can't tell\n\nThe bad:\n- A machine broke and it took them literally 2 months to fix\n- Charged me $5 more on my month-to-month subscription without notification\n- Was given attitude after I inquired about the $5 increase... (When I inquired about a $5 increase in my monthly fee discovered on my visa bill, they said the manager would call me. Never did. Inquired again on the same day and I was told they have a notice on. I said where's the notice? They replied, \"oh it was on the counter somewhere and we also tell people when they come in.\" Seriously? I go there twice a week and said hi to the lady every time. Why didn't she tell me? Then she gave me attitude as if I am supposed to read all announcements on her counter when I walk in. They then found the announcement BEHIND another announcement - and guess what? It was printed in 12 size font on a letter size paper. Good luck reading that. She then called her manager to resolve the situation, which was great, but couldn't resist giving me further attitude in the process. That was the end of that.)\n\nSo what made me quit? Bad customer service - can't even deal with a little troubleshooting without getting emotional... very amateur staff.\n\nIf I go back, I'd have to fake a smile every time I see the front desk staff and feel upset. Rather avoid the negative emotion and find another happy place to work out at.",

There are giant fans on the ceiling, but when you are doing cardio it is near impossible to work out in these conditions. And baseline I am always freezing and never complain about heat -- that just speaks to how hot this place gets. And I have overheard many people with the same complaint. I am not sure if its to save $$ on air conditioning, but come on, how are PF's clients supposed to work out in a sauna.\n\n\nAddendum: a few days ago, after I posted my review, I did see the manager walking around the gym with an AC serviceman. I am glad they take their clients' concerns seriously. I hope that the AC problem is fixed bc I do like this gym, but the heat is intolerable during a workout.",

  "text": "I needed to mix up my workout routine since sitting in the Y to lift weights was getting monotonous, and my visits there were getting fewer and farther between. I had done some rock climbing in a gym years ago when I worked close to one, and I have had my eye on this newer place for a while. I decided to make the change and recently signed up for a membership here at Evo. \n\nThe location is convenient for me since it is close to work. It is in the middle of a big industrial area with a lot of trucking and warehouses, but it is actually pretty easy to get to. The building's location close to the interstate makes it a fairly easy drive from a lot of the city. They have a parking lot in front, but could have used a little more space than what they have when it is busy. All of their pricing, business hours, and other great information are very easy to find on their website, so you can look at all of that on your own.\n\nGetting signed up was easy, but was also the one big issue I have had in my limited experience here so far. I knew I wanted to start a membership, so I went straight to the desk and said that. It was easy, and was just a matter of filling out a form with basic information, and signing their waiver form. After that, they got a credit card on file for monthly billing, and handed me my scan card to get in each time. And that was it. No tour, no direction, no intro to what they offer, no discussion of the rules, and no sort of safety or competency lesson whatsoever. It's really not a problem for me since I had spent a number of years climbing already, but he didn't know that. Other than the fact that I came in with my own gear, he had no idea what I knew or didn't know. I'm sure if I would have asked I could have gotten all of that, but it seems like it should be standard.\n\nOther than that, the experience has been fantastic. They have a gear shop that has all of the essentials you need for climbing, and their prices are reasonable if you wanted to get something that day and didn't want to drive up to REI. Their bathroom/locker room (at least the mens) has a bunch of lockers and plenty of space to change and get ready. They also have a shower. There are lots of storage cubbies out in the main area as well. They have much more lead climbing than other gyms I have been to, and it seems like most walls are set up both for lead climbing and top roping. It is a nice variety, and you'll find a route with most features you could be looking for. There are currently 3 auto belays spread throughout the room, and each of them give you access to numerous routes. Their bouldering section is a little on the small side, but still has a variety of problems. They are set up so that almost all problems top out if you wanted to. They set their routes using the same colored holds for each route, which is much nicer than having pieces of tape everywhere that get torn off or are hard to see. I put myself more on the beginner side of the spectrum, skill wise, but there are lots of routes and problems for someone at any level.\n\nThe people here are what really make this gym stand out compared to others. Everyone is extremely welcoming and outgoing,  and it appears to be a large group of regulars here. The one owner I met is a very nice guy, and all of the staff that I've interacted with has been great. It seems like this is more of a place that attracts members rather than random visitors, but they still have plenty of those. I have made it in a few times during my lunch break and it seems fairly empty during the day, but in the evening after work, it does get pretty full. \n\nIn addition to the climbing area, they have a smaller gym with some free weights and strength training items and a few pieces of cardio equipment. They also offer different instructor led classes that include yoga, strength training, aerial silks, PiYo, and even dancing. I have seen things about intro to climbing classes, special kid's events and classes, and even women only intro to climbing classes.\n\nNow, the obvious comparison to Hoosier Heights, the other major rock gym in town. HH is just way too inconvenient for me since I live downtown and that area of the city can be a mess in the evening. That being said, if that drive wasn't an issue, I would probably personally pick HH over Evo so far. Hoosier Heights is cheaper, bigger, offers more climbing and variety of routes, and just seems like an overall better deal. Evo, however, does have a much more community feel to the place and caters more towards climbers and regulars rather than kid's birthday parties and singles outings. They are also still growing and adding more things, so I'll see where they end up. \n\nI certainly like it here so far. It's only been a couple of weeks so I will update later if anything changes, but I plan on making this my go-to activity for exercise for the foreseeable future.",

  "text": "Finally, a high-end cycling studio without the high-end price!\n\nCycleBar is one of the newest cycling studio franchises to enter into what could be called an overcrowded industry. Rest assured, however--CycleBar is not like the others, and it's WONDERFUL!\n\nTaking a class at CycleBar is an experience you won't soon forget. Upon walking in, you're greeted by CycleBar employees, who will help you sign into class on an iPad (if you need help), and find the bike you're signed up to be on. Once you're logged in, they'll help you find the perfect shoes to wear for class (at no additional cost), which will clip onto the bike.\n\nNext, it's time to head to the lockers, where you'll swap your shoes, and lock your stuff away (no need to bring a lock--they've got you covered). Fill up a complementary, reusable CycleBar water bottle, and you're good to go! Time to head into the studio.\n\nAnd then....the class! Dim the lights, turn the music up, and get ready for the cycling experience of your life (yes, it's like a nightclub, but with bikes)! For the next 45 minutes, the instructor will motivate you and challenge you on your state-of-the-art bike--guiding you through the different resistance levels, speeds, etc. Towards the end of class, you'll do a few arm exercises with a (light) weighted bar, as well. 6 pounds never felt so heavy! If you're competitive, you can opt to have your stats displayed on the board overhead, so you can see how you compare to your fellow cyclers. By the end of class, you're drenched from a good workout, yet invigorated at the same time!\n\nOnce you walk out of the cycling studio, you're greeted with refreshing, lemon-scented towelettes, and fresh fruit (apples and bananas). From the water bottles to the shoes to the towels to the locker space to the fruit...everything at CycleBar is complementary, and feels like a first-class fitness experience! \n\nI've tried the other popular franchise cycling studios, which I will not name (although none others are in the Tampa Bay area)--and while I've enjoyed them, I must say, I've often felt like I've been overcharged. FINALLY, CycleBar is the cycling experience I've been looking for--affordable in price, but extraordinary in experience. Thank you, CycleBar!\n\nP.S. The only thing I would change about CycleBar South Tampa is the schedule. I would love to see more classes added in the mornings (i.e. 7:30, 8:30, 9:30, etc.), but right now, the majority of their class times on weekdays are in the late afternoon and evenings. I am hoping this will change as customer demand grows! :)",

  "text": "I was able to snag a 3 month unlimited membership coupon from Gilt.com for about $225. I was a bit nervous at first due to the price tag and 3 month commitment and the fact that it's a new studio but the savings were steep (from the Gilt coupon), the location was perfect, the schedule had super early classes (6 a.m.) and late classes (8:30 p.m.), and I was looking for more cross training than just yoga zen. I've been to half a dozen classes so far and I love it. This studio will definitely get you in shape and help gain and tone muscle a lot faster than a traditional yoga class. However, do keep in mind that this is not a traditional yoga studio. If you're able to overlook that aspect than you will fall in love too. Only catch, membership rates are super steep. Even though it's a good fit for me as far as style, after my three month membership experience, I won't be renewing unless I win the lottery or they decrease their rates... I'd rather join the Bellevue's gym for all that money.",

This place serves my purpose because I'm not fond of the nearby planet fitness or Giant in Delran.  My experience of joining was a little overbearing and quite unnecessary; it seemed like a car sales pitch and I quickly interrupted the staff member signing me up. And I responded \"just tell me what is the cost and what do I have access to\"!!!\n\nAfter joining I was introduced to one of the personal trainers and he tried to give me his pitch and quickly dismissed the need for his service; I mean I have been weight training for over 20 years and have ran several long distance races. At age 43 I maintain a pretty high level of fitness and I wasn't in need of there personal trainer and I made that clear to both the salesman and the personal trainer at my initial signing. However even after making that clear; I received 6 additional phone calls from there personal trainer Joe trying to sign me up. After each phone call I said I wasn't interested and he continued to call me. These phone calls came from a similar number of a family member so each time I answered interrupting important work meetings. I am not sure how much clearer I needed to be???? These calls annoyed me so much that I contemplated canceling my membership.\n\n\nLastly my observations while weight training were a little disappointing. Weights and equipment were scattered all over the floor, which is literally an accident waiting to happen.  The men's locker room cleanliness was disturbing. I observed  fecal matter on the wall in one of the toilet stalls; as harsh as it sounds men's locker room in public gyms are generally fifthly. I just wish these issues we're addressed. I'm not sure what type of environment people grew up in but a locker room in this condition would cause me to have least contact in that area or use better hygiene. I literally saw people walking bare footed.....which is disgusting in a public gym......has anyone heard of shower shoes???????Besides theses issues I generally like the gym they just need to work on the sanitation and keeping things off the floor in the free weight area to prevent accidents.\n\nOverall ok gym just some fixable issues that a decent manager should address.",

I still tried to STTFP (stick to the f*n plan), but I wasn't always so diligent so it wasn't a huge shock when the scale didn't move every week. The FitFam was always sharing different ways to cook or season the food so it didn't become boring and repetitive. The workouts seemed a bit easier because my body knew what was going on. I was stronger and a bit faster with some of the workouts. I was super happy when the scale's numbers went down (of course) but the real progress and joy came when people started noticing that I was losing weight...not to mention I needed new clothes!! The coaches are so wonderful. I sat down with Dylan because I was worried about not making the final goal. He gave me some pointers on what I should do which included extra cardio after the workouts. I lost over 5 pounds that week! I also started going to the mobility class on Saturday morning. Coach Adriana led that class and she showed us the right way to do deep stretches with foam rollers and lacrosse balls. I have to say that Fridays are my favorite times of the week. The workout is lovingly called \"Booty Friday\"! That's also the night I go and join Zumba Dan for a great dance routine. Still can't make my hips move, but it's fun none the less. I'm down almost forty pounds, but I still have a ways to go. I'm a member of the club, but more importantly, a member of the FitFam. There is so much support from everyone in the community. I wouldn't change this experience for anything in the world!! Thanks to some of the best coaches- Adriana, Dylan, Phillip, Dan, Rachel, Anish, Bre, Shelby and of course Matt Weaver for starting me on this program. (and anyone else I might have forgotten...)",

They're like concentrated weights or cannonballs with handles.  Apparently, Maxercise was the first gym in the US to feature kettlebells and every instructor here has years of experience in teaching and using kettlebells.  For the first time in my life, I have muscle definition in my arms and shoulders.  I love it! \n\nGym- it's small and unassuming but I feel more comfortable working out here than anywhere else in the city.  Nobody bothers me and I don't feel like I'm getting checked out by the guys.  Everyone here is just focused on getting in shape and I've never felt judged for my flabby thighs or my girl-gut.\n\nPersonal trainers- Reasonable rates, each instructor will develop a personal fitness plan for YOU and not some weird outline that they expect you to change your daily life for.  For instance, they're not going to demand that you buy a medicine ball or kettlebells for your home, you tell them what your goals are and what you have available (as in, not at the gym) and they'll work around that.  Ask for Alma, she's a godsend.  She's helped me lose weight and stay on track, something that I haven't been able to do, well, ever. \n\nPROS- several different packages to choose from, very friendly, NOT a meathead gym, SUPER woman-friendly\n\nCONS- no pool, no kid's classes",

  "text": "I've always been a bit skeptical about Crossfit in general let alone starting with a Groupon to try it out but I figured it was my best way of seeing what it was all about for a really great deal. You'll begin in the On Ramp classes at first to master the moves and understand what each move is supposed to be done like and with proper form using no weight. I was immediately impressed with this technique and have since actually corrected moves I had previously been doing wrong for many years in the gym and not known it. 3 weeks into my Groupon I already had noticed a difference in my strength, fitness and body and couldn't believe it. I've accomplished things I never thought possible thanks to the help and support all the coaches here showed me. I was hooked after 3 weeks, graduated to the main box shortly after and have never looked back. I've made great friends and I always look forward to my workouts, which are at 5:30am :) I've never been a morning person but I'm truly motivated to get up and workout, starts my day off right! You won't regret giving this gym a shot, it's the best decision I've ever made and I've never been in better shape. They even do fun events and outdoor WODs & competitions pretty often which I absolutely love. They even have Crossfit kids which I think is awesome!\n\nP.S - the negative reviews below appear to be from truly negative people, you'd really have to be a bad person to get kicked out of this gym. Show up ready to sweat and have a good time!",

  "text": "I love this place!  My friend got me to do the first week free, and I managed to get 4 classes in the first week.  I love that it is just enough distance to have a personal workout, and enough instruction to make sure I am not going to get hurt, and that I am working the right muscles, and have the right form.  It is tough, it is crossfit, and right when I get to the moment where I think I'm going to die, the exercise stops and we move onto another body part or exercise.  it pushes you right to the limit and then backs off.  Everyone is very relaxed, and it is an instructional class format.  It is intimidating to walk into the gym, but half way into the class, you quickly realize everyone is into their own workout, nobody but the trainers are watching what you do.  I Highly recommend Battle Born, for the long timers, because they will find a way to challenge you, and to the new comers, because they will welcome you and turn you into a crossfiter.  Where else are you going to git a great workout and a personal trainer at such a great quality and price?!",

I appreciate that they let members suspend their memberships for a few months, and not have to cancel them, while the pandemic is still going on (which it is). But I'm very disappointed in their corporate HQ's decision to allow customers to not have to wear masks \"while actively working out\":\n\nhttps://popculture.com/trending/news/planet-fitness-walks-back-mandated-face-mask-policy-during-workouts/\n\nIt's a ridiculous policy - it's exactly when people are working out that they huff and puff and exhale deeply - and exhale the most aerosol droplets from their lungs, which then circulates all over the place! So, until either they change their policy to require masks 100% of the time - including while working out - or until the Covid risk is 100% over - we will keep our family's memberships suspended, or we might even cancel our memberships.  All because of an unwise corporate policy. It's really a shame.",

No need to go into gory details :-)\n\nThey offer an outdoor aqua park, with lazy river and slides, kiddie pool and playground, huge sandbox, etc. An indoor, heated pool...kiddie and adult lap pool. You can walk the indoor track year round. You can go to group fitness classes (everything from turbo kick to spinning) or you could sweat it out in the fitness center on your own. They offer a wide range of recreational activities for young and old. In the nicer months you could go for a jog on the Monon Trail that splits this place, or take a walk/jog, maybe feed some ducks near the \"pond\" and many paths. \n\nI have heard people say that they thought the Monon Center was private, and it IS NOT! \n\nI recommend this place to anyone and everyone.",

I'll follow her to her next gig, but I won't be going back here.\n\nThis place is not at all relaxing.  You walk in to a gym complete with clanking equipment and blasting music.  There was some sort of crime movie on the flat screen tv in the waiting area.  When my friend and I walked in to redeem our Groupons, the receptionist didn't really greet us.  In fact, she looked confused when she saw us come in.  Then I found out why.\n\nThey lost our reservations.  Instead of saying they lost our reservations, she insisted that I never called to make them.  I had to show her my cell phone log to prove I called.  THEN when she saw the date and time, she announced that she was the person who had taken my appointment.  No apology.  None.   No offer to do anything for us.  My friend had come in from New Jersey for the day specifically for the spa.  Apparently, nobody was there to take us so she had to try to call someone in.   She was only able to get one therapist to come in, so she said we could either re-schedule or go back to back.  Still no apology, still no offer to compensate.  \n\nMy friend isn't one to take things lying down so she asked for some kind of consideration for the inconvenience.  At first, the receptionist  said nothing could be done but then said she would call the manager.  She came back saying they could offer us 15% off a future service.  Since we wouldn't be coming back, that wasn't going to work.  Instead of dealing with it, she offered to let my friend call the manager, which she did.  Ultimately the manager offered to increase our massages from 50 minutes to 85 minutes each with no extra charge.  That was nice, but unfortunately made each of us sit even longer with nothing to do while the other was getting the treatment.   \n\nWhen we were finally brought back we had to fill out some bizarre forms to get a locker.  I don't know what's happened in the past but they're really protective of their lockers.  The steam shower in the locker room was broken.  The \"waiting room\" for the actual spa is a small bare room separated from the locker room by a curtain.  Again, not at all relaxing.  \n\nThe actual massage was fantastic.  I wish my experience wasn't so bad or I would go back to her every week.",

Too many meatheads and women who think it's appropriate to work out in their underwear. The girl at the front desk isn't nice and doesn't even acknowledge your existence when you walk in. She just plays on her phone the entire time. My fiance is the nicest guy you could ever meet. He always says Hi to her and she just ignores him. The Yoga class is not at all relaxing and only focuses on stretching but not breathing or \"finding your center\". They also roped off a giant area for personal training. Most of all, too many people/meatheads, who just stand around and talk and socialize and don't actually work out. No wifi and from what I understand, cars get broken into all the time.

  "text": "Really disappointed in this gym. I came home to visit for the holidays and wanted to workout while I was vacationing. First off, there was a sign on the door that read that they would not be giving guest passes during the Thanksgiving weekend. What an awful way to advertise that you truly care about peoples fitness journey rather than making money for your gym. I used to gym here when I lived in Boise a few years ago and I will make sure to never recommend this specific gym to anyone of my friends and family who still live in the area. Secondly, the gym hours were visibly plastered on not only your website, the doors and also the note placed on each of the windows. I made sure to go during the hours a membership specialist would be there because I had a feeling my key fob wouldn't work...and sure enough it didn't. I called and left a VM and STILL have not received a returned call. It's now Sunday and this was Wednesday. Horrible business practice.",

Any type of fitness plan can be achieved as there is open functional space, free weights, TRX, cables, Smith Machine, 1/2 Rack, a loaf of selectorized strength equipment and cardio. Great gym",

Even though sometimes when I come up to park and see the parking lot looks full I feel discouraged but when I go inside i am always surprised that there isn't that many people in the gym as I had thought. You have access to personal training which I LOVE. I was never looking for a personal trainer but definitely someone to just show me how the equipment works so I can strength train. You sign up for the classes online and show up and Liz will show you how it works and tech you reps! I really do like this gym but if I had to add one suggestion it would be to put fans in the locker room area of the bathroom. I like to sit in there after I'm drenched in sweat to cool off by myself but it sucks with no fan in there",

  "text": "This is a story that will come with impending updates...\n\nSo, I've been a member of Anytime Fitness for several years now. All locations are independently owned, though visiting one location more than X times per month automatically means your home club updates.\n\nThis location opened last year, which was exciting to me because it meant I had a gym to frequent when I stayed with my significant other. \n\nFor at least a month, this gym had that \"new gym smell\" free of dirt and sweat. They had done a great job with the contemporary feel of the place, and there was almost always a staff member on site cleaning the equipment or vacuuming the floors. These are all good things. Not to mention that with several sites across the country, it's rare to find an Anytime Fitness that is so packed you have to wait on your desired machine/piece of equipment. \n\nSo, I was sitting happily at 4 or 5 stars for several months.\n\nThe nasty weather we've had, combined with a new schedule has left me very little time to visit the gym to work out. Additionally, things have changed for me financially and it just does not make sense monitarily to continue to pay $35/mo - especially when some bigger boys have come out with more frugal offers.\n\nSo I start to look into canceling my membership. I read many, MANY horror stories online about it being nearly impossible to terminate a relationship with Anytime Fitness. I start to worry. So, I call my 96th street gym and the gentleman to talk to an actual person about canceling my membership.\n\n\"Hey, no problem. All we require is 30 days' written notice that you would like to cancel your membership with us. You can send an email if you'd like, and here is your account number.\"\n\nThough a little disappointed that they hadn't tried to keep me on as a customer (lower price, hint hint), I sent my little email informing them that I wanted to cancel my membership in 30 days.\n\nAbout four days later, I receive an email stating that they're sorry, but they can't accept written notice as a means of terminating a membership. They're sorry, but I physically have to come into the facility and do that in person.\n\nOh, okay, so THIS is where Anytime Fitness wants to start dicking me around.\n\nSo! As this is a story that shall remain \"To Be Continued\" until I can drag my out-of-shape ass across town to see what they're going to try to say to me in person, I'll offer them the benefit of the doubt with three stars. \n\nTo improve things, I'd recommend this location makes sure ALL staff is aware of ALL policies.",

  "text": "Professional trainers that ACTUALLY cater to your personalized physical heatlh needs!  \n\nMy previous trainer in Chicago was actually overweight which made me feel like, \"If he's asking me to do these things, shouldn't he practice what he preaches?!\"  So when I moved to Nashville, I ventured out to find a new personal trainer in Nashville, independent of large franchised gyms.   \n\nWhen I first walked into LEAN, I was pretty nervous.  You know walking into a gym with fit people and me walking with my gut hanging out made me feel really uncomfortable.  But all the trainers aren't here to judge, they're here to actually make you feel better by losing weight and making you stronger and even provide educational classes on nutrition on occasion.  \n\nI've been going to LEAN for the past few months and they really know how to motivate you to go one step further that I probably wouldn't be able to do on my own. \n\nFor me and probably like many others, I lacked the motivation to push myself to my limit, hindered by negative attitude.  The trainers at LEAN positively motivate and encourage you to do your best and whip you up into shape.   \n\nIf your New Year's resolution is to get in shape in Nashville, go to LEAN personal training!",

This studio does an amazing job of making everyone feel comfortable and really pushing you to your limits.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about all the people I have met thus far, and I can say this without being an actual member (and that's on me due to a travel and work schedule - nothing on them! One day I will be a member :) \n\nA clean, welcoming lobby - full of inspiration from their word wall, a small area of retail and a memo board with all the upcoming events for the week - nice touches. \n\nThey even have a small child care area which is a rarity in studio life around Indianapolis. \n\nGreat, clean equipment - nice and spacious bathrooms - and locking lockers. OH, and a personal favorite -an ICE MACHINE. \n\nLove, Shred. Do yourself a favor and take the challenge of a class here.",

I love that's it's open 24/7 - it really helps it never feel too crowded. It's also great to have that flexibility to work out whenever you please. \nI love working out in smaller, locally owned fitness centers. Maybe I'm slightly biased because my family owns a small town fitness center in the town I grew up in so I'm partial to smaller gyms. But this place really feels like home and reminds me so much of my families business. \n\nProbably my favorite aspect of the Mei Fitness is they are UNASHAMED in their faith. I love how they play Christian music and have \"there is Power in the name of Jesus\" written on the wall. I just love this about them. \n\nI highly recommend working out here. The equipment is brand new and they have a great selection of items. The only thing missing (or at least I can't find it) is a reclining ab crunch bench. Other than that they really do have everything there. Group classes are available as well! Go get your fitness on here!",

I used personal trainers and were essentially $50/session and once you used trainers the fees for standard membership became included. \n\nCons:\nCancellation process was difficult. I thought I had cancelled everything correctly only to find out that my account renewed. I must have done something incorrectly but I was suddenly getting phone calls from a collections agency (over $88) and took a hit to my credit. \nShowers are gross.

The showers handles in the three stalls checked were in need of repair.  It took a while but the water did warm up. The rest of the locker room was as expected. \nAlso, not even a visual nod as I walked in & scanned my phone.  This is important as a safety feature: some employee should at the very least get a visual on every patron given the crazy world we live in.",

  "text": "Updating this review about a year later. \nThe situation has really declined at Powerhouse.  It's sad because the gym has an excellent location and some much potential.  Also, I have taken a few classes there and really enjoyed them (most recently, a great yin yoga class.) But maintenance is deficient on machines.  Certain cardio machines remain broken for weeks.  Half of the treadmills are squeaky and feel unstable. Certain weight machines, while not broken, are in clear need of maintenance they are not receiving. There is a annual upgrade charge that is supposed to be used for new equipment but I have not seen any new equipment during the past year. The music is unreasonably loud and only tolerable if you enjoy never-ending 90s trance and breaks (word to PHG: most people enjoy listening to their earphones when working out).  I stay here because it's convenient to my office and home.  I will probably switch to the JCC as soon as it opens .",

  "text": "This gym has it all - pre and post COVID-19. Before COVID coffee and tea was offered as well as free snacks occasionally popping up on the counter. The snack selection is FIRE as are the drinks. There are plenty of options, and if you need chalk or some gear either to rent or buy - they've got it covered. Post-COVID they still offer snacks and drinks to purchase - but the complimentary coffee is on hold until further notice. Totally understandable.\n\nAs far as route setting goes - it's solid. The routes vary across the board for difficulty and the rating is very consistent. They make it easy to locate start holds, as well as determine the difficulty with range of color for bouldering rather than individual route names. This makes the wall significantly less cluttered - and the makes the routes super easy to read.\n\nThe employees and management/owners are amazing. Super friendly, kind, and knowledgeable. Always down to help with beta, offer a catch on the wall, or answer any general questions.\n\nThe gym is clean, well stocked, and has great circulation of air.\n\nDuring pandemic times - all members and employees must wear a mask. It makes me feel safe and taken care of knowing that they are putting health first! \n\nI've been climbing here for over a year and will never switch as long as I live in Indy!",

  "text": "I joined City Fitness with a Rue La La deal. I am a fitness fanatic and go to other bootcamp classes with a trainer; however, I needed to have a back up gym to go to for other types of classes and with equipment to use on my own when the mood strikes me.  City Fitness is not far from me, and newer and nicer than Sweat, so I decided to join.\n\nI like the facility. The machines are new and so far have been kept in great condition. There are different spaces throughout the gym for stretching/abs/body weight things as well as lifting and cardio.  \n\nI primarily go to the classes, though. My thoughts:\n\n1. Mondays at 5:30 there is a Bokwa class. Super fun/easy/high energy dance class. Instructor is fantastic. Go there.\n\n2. Yoga classes -  I like Carmencita, but she doesn't use music. Which I think is a little annoying. Malik and Abby's classes are good as well. Studio is a little small, so try to get there a few minutes early. There are straps, mats, and blocks for use.\n\n3. Spinning - I like Steve's classes - some intervals, more endurance. Timaree's Friday class is one of my favorites - high energy, lots of sprinting and jumping intervals.  You have to reserve a bike 90 minutes ahead of time. And if the class starts at 6:00, you have to call at 4:30 on the dot. Seriously.\n\n4. Zumba - I went to one of the classes. I don't remember the instructor's name, but I was definitely NOT impressed by her. Maybe it was an off day, but she was more tired  than I was. Not okay.",

  "text": "I was looking for a pool in order to swim laps. I tried a non-olympic sized pool, one that was in fact not even 25m long, and it was miserable. And then I discovered the Kroc Center!\n\nThis facility is fairly new, built last year (it is now 2012). All the spaces are brightly lit, and there is a cafe right in the middle (that smells WONDERFUL by the time I leave). The lockers are also really clean. The pool facilities are AMAZING. When you first enter, there is a kids fun park type play area and hot tub. It was pleasantly busy, but not overcrowded when I tried visiting on a Saturday.\n\nThe pool has 25m lanes and is 25 yards wide. It is made with Myrtha Stainless Steel technology imported from Italy. It's supposed to absorb the vibrations caused from swimming and increase speeds. I don't know if it's true, but I WILL say that my times compared to another pool I recently swam at were pretty drastically better. Super clean, super nice. The one thing I don't like is the temperature between the lockers and the pool - I diligently take a shower before entering the water, and it's really cold in that space.\n\nThe staff is really great and friendly. I haven't tried the rest of the facilities, but it looks very well used and liked. It's a little tough to get there from Center City, and I imagine it wouldn't be convenient for regular use if you don't own a car, but it's certainly the nicest AND most affordable pool I've found in the area.",

The staff is always super cool too. \n\nThe machinery is very nice and there at least two of every machine. Cardio machines are super plentiful. There are rows and rows of treadmills. I do wish purple wasn't their signature color, but such is life. \n\nThe black membership offers unlimited access to tanning beds and massage chairs/hydro beds. I can't say anything about the tanning beds because I'm Irish and we don't tan. But the hydro massage beds are soooo nice. The chairs are nice too but not as relaxing as the hydro beds. Black membership gets you half off drinks from their cooler too. \n\nOverall this place is well worth the monthly fee. Be advised though that if you go late at night on weekends they are only open until 7 on Fridays and Saturdays. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.",

They were very pleasant and helpful. I ended up buying 2 pair of shoes and compression socks, more than I had in mind when I walked in the door. \n\nThis company had a booth at the CCC10k expo, which is how I found out about them.

I complained once and was told they only change the heat to ac once a year and even though it was 80 outside they would not turn the AC on as likely they would have to use the heat again.  I asked them to make sure they knew they were in TN and they assured me they knew that. (I know several days I have had my home's AC unit on and turned the heat on later in the day and vice versa)  Working out without AC in high 70s and 80s?  No, not my cup of tea so I bolted.

  "text": "Cityoga has been my 'home' yoga studio since 2008. My second class was with Lisa D., who still teaches there to this day. In fact many of the teachers have been teaching and practicing there for many years, which I feel is a true testament to the quality of studio and the community built around it.\n\nYou will find a variety of classes at Cityoga to meet every skill level and almost every yoga style. Here's a quick run down of my suggestions:\n\nBeginner: Lisa Daugherty's Saturday 9:15am Slow Flow class. Lisa has a great knowledge of yoga, and communicates very effectively in her classes to get you into the poses. She is also known to give a quick massage with essential oils at the end of some of her classes. You can also always, always expect to sing the Shanti song at the end of class too, but no one is judging if you wish to remain silent.\n\nThe Traditional Yogi: Carol Tharp-Perin's Sunday 12:30pm Ashtanga class. If you like to always know what posture is coming up next... this is the class for you. I like to call Ashtanga the bend-y pretzel style of yoga. Also, you aren't supposed to 'watch' other people in yoga class, but I recommend watching Carol. She is very graceful and makes yoga look effortless (she's had a bit more practice than myself!).\n\nFun Spirited: Any Adrienne Lovell class. She's a new teacher compared to the majority at Cityoga. She likes to experiment with variations to postures and always adds a little something different to each class.\n\nFeel the Burn: Diane Hancock's Sunday 11am Kundalini class. If you are looking for something way different from what you'd expect from yoga... This class is it! Kundalini is one of the oldest forms of yoga and it is meant to stoke your inner fire. Motions in postures are repetitive and are done while doing the 'breath of fire', breathing through the nose and out through the mouth. I've only been to this class once, and it was quite the experience! Not many yoga teachers in town have been bestowed a spiritual name by a master yogi in India, nor do they sit on a fluffy white rug while teaching.\n\nSeeking Technical Perfection: Any Lisa Riolo class. She's really great at fine tuning alignment.\n\nSo there are some classes I suggest exploring on your Tour de Yoga. Now for the studio itself you can expect an spacious lobby where you will store your shoes and other belongings in cubbies along the wall. There restrooms for women and men to change in. Beverages are available for purchase. They offer a variety of yoga related products including clothes, mats and jewelry. \n\nI highly recommend following the studio on social media or signing up for emails. They offer so many wonderful workshops! Last year I did the couples yoga class around Valentine's day taught by Lisa D. and her husband. It was a great experience! I've also done a few other workshops with guest teachers from around the country/world. \n\nI have had the great honor to practice with teachers in Central America and Asia and even a vedic monk, and I can honestly say that some of the teacher's at Cityoga are truly world class. I highly doubt any other yoga studio in town has the combined years of experience that Cityoga has. You truly are placing your health into the hands of these teachers. You can injure yourself in yoga! Pay attention to how your teachers pay attention and stick with the teachers that aren't just all about blaring hip-hop music and yelling out instructions. Paying $11-15 a class should buy you experience and/or attentiveness.\n\nNamaste and have nice day, Yelpers!",

I was not planning to join because you can get a gym membership at a traditional gym cheaper, but they had a free trial so I tried it and now I see why it's worth the upgrade!\n\n I could go to a gym and struggle by myself trying to figure out the machines and never know if I'm truly doing it right or getting anywhere, then probably giving up early because I feel I worked hard enough.\n\nOr I could go to Orangetheory and have a personal trainer who is knowledgeable and friendly come and give me effective workouts without complicated machines and lead me in proper form. \n\nComing here is like coming to work with a personal trainer in a group. Because it's a group you save so much money than working 1:1 costs , but you still get a good amount of attention. They manage to give individual attention really well despite being in a group. They make you feel special and they are a available for questions during and after the workouts. \n\nBeing in this group motivates you. You also get the proper mix of cardio and lifting in a HIIT style which is the best type of training for strength, health and weight loss. \n\nThey also have really good music playing which pumps you up and they keep a good variety to every workout. It never gets boring and you get a great workout every time.\n\nI can only afford to go 1 day a week with my current budget and schedule, but it's one of the things I look forward to most in my week and I'm already noticing improvements in muscle",

It's been a positive experience with OTF And I've seen improvements in my overall strength and endurance.  The workout always changes and I never know what to expect (which I like).  I travel a lot, so although this is my home gym, I've been able to take other classes in different OTF locations which is awesome.  \n\nI also hate running on the treadmill, but the programs are varied and challenging, so even the long blocks on the tread go by fast.  I find I push myself a lot harder with the coaches motivation.  And I definitely think Blaze is the most challenging!",

The gym I used to belong to didn't event cost close to that for a month's membership! \n\nI looked on Yelp to see what I could find with small business owner locations. That's when I found reviews mentioning the option to buy an online pass for K2F. I purchased a pass online, received a door code via email and visited the gym that night. Everything I needed I found here, as well as something I never see when I visit gyms: a deadlift jack! They keep the place really clean and I love the brick walls. I am not sure but I think I spied a hip thruster platform as well. If it was, major plus to these guys. I do wish there was a little more of a kettlebell selection, but it's not a deal breaker. \n\nThere isn't a locker room but there are 3 large bathrooms and each one has a shower in it. The gym also provides towels if you need them. I love that they are dog friendly (some members came in with a dog and an employee set up a small pen near the door) and provide doggy treats to them. Huge points. \n\nIf I lived here, there isn't a doubt I would join. I like the variety of equipment, it's clean and the members seem nice. I'm really happy I found this place.",

One of my gym barometers is \"how obvious are the towels?\" I'm an observant person...if I can't find the towels, likely no one else can either, and that means I'm going to be sitting in their pool of sweat. I'm not a germ freak, so I really don't care about the spray bottles of disinfectant, but these were also nowhere to be found. There was \"sanitizing foam\" on the walls, but I find this inefficient. \n\nI have done 2 spin classes. For one, the instructor didn't show up, but the class was taught by one of the people IN the class...a good work out all the same. The other class was Saturday morning, and it was AWESOME. A really hard workout with a great instructor that really encourages you to push yourself. The spin studio is still too hot though, with only one lousy box fan. There should be oscillating fans in there, for sure. \n\nIt kinda bugged me that the people I saw who worked there didn't look like they were in shape at all. I think I've been forever spoiled by the Wisconsin Athletic Club. ...sigh...\n\nThe gym is nice and very clean, with plenty of equipment to go around. Lots of parking, and pretty easy in and out. I did notice the babysitting area looked nice, and they do have a good selection of snacks and smoothies for post-workout.",

As a kid I vastly preferred dance class, ice skating, horseback riding and running around like a psycho at the playground to any sort of scary ball-coming-at-my-face team sport. \n\nEven in my perma-intoxicated college run I made it to yoga several times a week and took advantage of Temple's dance program, but now as I edge up on thirty, I can no longer rely on my superior metabolism to keep me on the attractive side of chubby. \n\nHere is where Sweat's trial program comes into play -- 7 days to scope it out for free.  I took several yoga classes, used the ellipticals and stair climbers, even did some silly-looking motions on weight machines.  Keep in mind I am the most novice of novices when it comes to organized exercising.  I don't know what to do and the whole thing seems scary and intimidating, so I just get on the nearest treadmill and hope desperately that no one looks at me jiggling away.  \n\nSweat in Bella Vista is a very nice gym -- it's well laid-out, there are plenty of machines, the group fitness instructors are friendly and competent.  Still, once my 7-day trial ran out, I didn't take the plunge and join.  Mostly because I still hate exercise.  But one can hardly blame that on the gym.",

I reached out to membership services I got really bad customer service & inconsistent information. On top of all that I had moved and can no longer go to any other two locations that they had in the area so I requested about three months and in adVance to cancel in which I was giving really bad directions in terms how to cancel. They wanted me to stay in contract and just pay for no reason which was really weird. Kept emailing the same guy and talking over the phone and he said he would cancel but he didn't now I'm totally fed up and that's why am writing this as the gym it's just so desperate for members They can't even cancel memberships even if their members move it's just really ridiculous.

  "text": "UPDATE: Brandywine Y management has restored Silver Sneakers to this and other Chester County branches.  \nThis is what happens when a health club tries to do too much, and tries to please everybody (and ends up pleasing nobody).  All those different facilities (tennis, pools, kid stuff...) mean the place is often packed.\nDon't bother with the treadmill; the parking lot is so crowded you'll probably get a long walk just to get inside.  Part of the problem is all the special promotions in which non-members crowd out actual members.\nThe physical plant is OK.  The problem is the classes.  The instructors are poorly supervised; each does her own thing.  Find a class you like and then somebody else shows up and it's completely different.  No quality control, training or supervision.  When one instructor subs for another, she often walks in and admits she knows nothing about this type of workout (cardio, pilates, yoga or whatever) but acts like it doesn't matter.  \nToo many people treat the Health Center as a place to hang out and socialize.  They \"Bogart\" the machines as they get into conversations (forget about listening on headphones as you work out).  Management thinks the Health Center is a place where everybody knows your name.  It's not a place to just go and do a workout routine.\nThe target market is clearly families with kids.  If that's not you, forget it.  If you are looking for a particular type of work out and don't need everything in one place, there are better (less crowded) options.",

Now I know why I got no enrollment fee and it's only 40 per month now, let me explain...\n\nHonestly I'm staying a member simply because I live a few blocks away and one of my friends I grew up with is an incredible trainer there and it's only 40 bucks a month for me.\n\nThe men's locker room, showers, steam room, and dry sauna are super run down and deferred janitorial and maintenance seems to be the policy. The towels are super rough and like sandpaper. The Men's steam room has a broken door that is untrue to frame and the steam is out of order most of the time. The wood work in the dry sauna has got to be decades old, and is rotting and creaking and ready to break and hurt someone at any moment. The shower fixtures are unacceptable: some are only hot water, some are only cold, and most spray water in a way that is painful to the skin.\n\nI have been a member (this time) for less than one month after being away for over 2 years, and I have to mention that nothing much has changed or improved over the years, in fact it's gotten worse. Some of the current staff, young kids, that run the front counter are rather brash or even rude in the morning, and don't make me feel welcome when I arrive. I even remember hearing one of them make a comment to his buddy that his meal time was being interrupted or something, and all I could observe is that this particular kid only wanted to chat with friends and eat. \n\nWhen I left that morning I had to wait around for several minutes to trade my locker key for my membership card and other members were also gathering around front counter looking for assistance as well before one of them yelled out. Then this male employee comes out with a mouthful of food and a bad attitude!  I'm like: your STILL eating? He looked at me like I just offered edification and said ALL I DO IS EAT! Then laughed it off like it was acceptable to be like that.\n\nSome of the staff there are super unprofessional and some are just the opposite and very nice and friendly! So I'm not generalizing that the entire staff has a training issue, only most of them. So it's a like a dice roll or based on someone's mood that day. I'm considering getting a tour of Lakeridge Athletic Club, I hear it's super nice and I'd rather pay more and be happy than deal with a gym that won't repair or renovate or properly train their staff.\n\nThanks for considering my opinion and what is true for me.\n\nThanks for listening.",

I could not walk for a week afterwards and I was so hot during the class it was painful.\n\nThen, the real stress of medical school kicked in and I needed some sort of relief. Pushing myself in the gym wasn't doing it for me. I was so mentally tired after a long day that going to the gym became a chore.\n\nEnter Flywheel back into my life, considerations of a buy a 3 class pass for $28 promotion. For less than a dinner out, I got 3 butt-kicking, sweat drenching classes. Best part: I did not have to think for one. single. minute. This is what I love the best about Flywheel. Every worry about my day was checked at that studio door and the only thing I focused on was RPMs, the Torq-board, and the bumping music. It was therapy. \n\n3 classes in 1 week later and I am hooked. I am shamelessly buying more classes although they are out of my budget because I love it. My 3rd class was my best so far. After the first two my body got used to it and I could really push myself. Yes, it gets hot in the class, but that actually motivates me to go in this freezing winter weather! I was intimidated at first (like with the shoes clipping into the bike) but seriously, no one gives a damn about the neighbor on the bike next to them (in a good way). In other words, this is a judgement free zone where people come to zone out, so you have no reason to be self-conscious! Plus, all of the workers are super friendly (when they aren't kicking your ass on 34 torque).\n\nIf you are looking to get away from a boring fitness routine and let your mind zone out for a good 45 minutes, I highly encourage you to check out Flywheel.",

  "text": "Pros: Cheap membership, clean, ample parking and good equipment without being too crowded.\n\nCons: Sales staff is like a caricature of pushy, untalented sales people using painfully transparent tactics. Had already decided to buy before talking to them, but they still lied to my face, added in fees after I signed and tried to pressure me into signing up (make your decision before, they are worthless to talk to and are always running a \"special' that \"just about to end\" for the same price perpetually listed on the site.)\n\nI hear AWFUL things about the trainers. So, I would avoid that part. But, all in all, its a cheap gym with all the equipment you need and lots of flexibility with locations to use.\n\nUnless you want a \"signature\" location which is the exact same gym + towels for 50% higher monthly rate. \n\nJust don't ever expect anything but the worst from their staff.",

  "text": "This review is for the Platoon Boot camp at the Art Museum. \n\nI have been doing it for the past couple years and would recommend it to anyone.  The group of people that work out are very friendly and range in ages from 20's to 70's.  For $115.00 monthly fee, you can work out at any of their locations 6 days a week which rounds out to about $5.00 a an hour long session.  I think that's a fair price since most personal training sessions are like $50.00 and above.  Basically the week days are split up to cater to certain body parts.. Monday is lower body workout, Tuesday is upper body workout, Wednesday is cardio day, Thursday is lower body workout, Friday is upper body workout and Saturday is whatever the teacher wants to do.  They break up the workouts by always moving and changing things up so your body never gets used to 1 particular workout.  There are also 2 different groups.  There is a phase 1 and a phase 2 group.  Phase 1 does more modified workouts than phase 2 and you have your choice as to what group you would like to work out in.  Some days if I'm hung over, I'll do phase 1.  It's completely up to you.  The instructors are all VERY well versed on anything that has to do with form, fitness, etc.  If you have any questions or aren't doing a particular excercise correctly..they will let you know in a nice way.  Just recently I needed help on doing arm circles above my head..my hand eye coordination sucks..it was funny.  They also motivate you when you are slacking or when they know you are about to quit.  Even a little \" come on guys!  keep moving!\" can really lift your spirits when you think you are about to die.  It also doesn't hurt that you can look out over the  the beautiful city while you are getting your ass kicked..or look at Rocky's Statue for motivation!",

The free weight and stationary weight area are just the right size. Sometimes you have to wait for the weight machines though. The daycare center offers 2 hours of free child care, which is awesome! My daughter loves it there, and she has separation anxiety from me 99% of the time. The woman in the daycare is super sweet! I don't stress at all about leaving my daughter with her. My daughter also loves it there. My only gripe is that there is one person who works there that isn't very nice and has a poor work ethic. She is super sweet to all the guys that come in, but is on the verge of rude to the females. The gym is also dirtier when she is working. But, I'm not there to make friends so, it's not a deal breaker for me.",

  "text": "CROOKS, AVOID AT ALL COST.\n\nI'd give zero stars if possible. Moved out of state and cancelled our membership IN PERSON before moving (we were not bound by any contract per our agreement--it was a month to month payment). I actually went back twice to confirm that the manager had gotten the notice, since I left the cancellation notice with a front desk person who hand wrote a note on a scrap of paper and put it on the manager's messy desk. When I returned and found the manager he did not know about the note, dug through the piles of paper on his desk and found it, and confirmed that he would take care of the cancellation that day. \n\nThey never cancelled, lost the record of our cancellation, continued to charge us for three months, refused to refund, and insisted that we needed fly across country to cancel in person (AGAIN). We had to file false charges with our bank and send a written letter to cancel our month to month membership--a letter they were supposed to email and knowledge receipt of and did not. \n\nWhile we were there the place was in constant disrepair. One of the attachments that allows you to rack the squat bar on the one squat/power rack broke and it took 2-3 months for them to order a new one. In other words, their only squat rack was out of commission for months. When they did fix it, it broke again and took another month or so to replace. There were uneven parts of the floor near the squat rack and seeing as the cleaning lady was in the women's locker room on her phone 99% of the time, I would venture to guess the equipment was constantly dirty as well. The bathrooms sure were. The only reason we did not leave earlier was that we were planning on moving across country anyway and the place was a couple blocks from our house. \n\nThe shoddy equipment and poor service could be explained by a tighter budget and explained by the lower cost of this gym, but the 1) billing mistakes and 2) complete refusal to acknowledge those mistakes and make it right were what prompted me to write this review.\n\nWith so many other choices popping up in Philly with great prices, there is no reason to ever join this gym.",

It's a good staple for your workout regimen, and is a great place to go and hammer out a lifting sesh or some cardio.\n\nI've taken their cycling classes and really enjoyed them- aside from the fact that cycling seats hurt my booty so bad (that's my own issue though). I've also tried out BodyPump (liked), Yoga (loved) and BodyAttack (not a fan).\n\nWhile I've had a great experience here, I recently wanted to cancel my membership to pursue other fitness classes that Axiom doesn't offer, and this has been a hassle. The biggest bummer is that my $25/month gym membership is costing me $65 for my final month. Axiom has a yearly enhancement fee of $40, and mine just so happens to land in the month of March. Since I didn't get my cancelation request in 15 days before this fee, I ended up having to pay it- even though its for the following year. Bummer...but I suppose I should have kept better tabs on this and then I wouldn't be throwing $65 down the drain.\n\nLesson here? Great gym...but be aware that should you ever want to cancel your membership you need to do so at least 15 days before your next billing cycle, or you'll be paying for an extra month.",

  "text": "Just walking down the hall into the entrance of Escape, you know you are in for a totally different spin class experience. Walking in the dark past the boxing area you find yourself in the spin room that seems a little shy on space.  You soon realize however that in nearly complete darkness, you have no idea how large the space really is. And while you're riding a stationary bicycle, how much do you really need.\n\nColie led the class well, explaining to all the newbies the equipment we would be using, the positions she would be utilizing and that the strength level was totally up to what we were comfortable with. \n\nA very pleasant surprise for me was that the amazing music set that was being utilized was complimented by the display of the music video that went along with it. The projection was large enough for all in the class to see. It was an engaging distraction from the ass kicking that Colie was handing me. In other spin classes that I have attended, I would typically find myself reflecting on the time hoping the hell I was going through would end soon. That was nowhere nearly the case here.\n\nSo as you can see, I was quite thrilled with the spin class experience that the Escape had to offer. The only downside for me is how far from home it is, but as with the gym I go to, I think the extra drive is worth it. It is also nice to see the revitalization of the downtown area and giving locals amazing reasons to re-visit their home downtown.",

Ignore the fact that I joined a gym as a New Years Resolution to get back into running along with hundreds (okay thousands) of other Americans who make these silly promises and don't keep them by the third week in January.\n\"The Heights\" is totally rad. Come here for the clean locker rooms. There's a family locker room for you and your toddlers (currently undergoing floor renovations-but I think that will be done soon). The pool is huge, with a slide, kiddie pool area and lap lanes. Treadmills? Plenty at 5pm, I haven't had to wait, or I just have had really good luck. There's an indoor track where 16 laps is a mile (um, dizzy much?). Basketball courts if you didn't get cut from the 7th grade team and don't have a resentment toward that whole god-for-saken sport and actually like playing basketball. \nI have a friend (shout out Joy Jones!) who teaches classes here that I have yet to take. But soon I will get up enough guts to take on her challenges. Maybe I'll try my legs at spinning-I've only fallen off twice before. \nOh....and the price is AHMAHZING. $20 a month for a single lady. You'd have to look up your own cost. I'm not your financial planner.",

  "text": "I wanted to make sure I was using this gym for a few months before I wrote a review.  I have now been going to this Planet Fitness for over 6 months, and there are some very obvious gains and losses that I need to point out.\n\nThis is what I call the \"McDonald's\" of gyms.  It's cheap, no frills, and to the point.  A friend of mine joined a gym around the neighborhood where he lives and we are constantly comparing amenities at our respective gyms.  Since my gym has no \"extras\" I was constantly saying to him \"oh damn I wish my gym had that! But mine's cheaper!\"  I also wouldn't say the staff at PF is exactly \"friendly,\" either.  I had one instance when I was trying to check in at the front desk and nobody was paying any attention to me (I stood there quite awhile), no warm welcome to this Planet.  I finally just said screw it and started to walk in.  AT THAT EXACT moment a gentleman looks up from his computer screen and says \"YOU NEED TO CHECK IN HERE!\"  Just peachy!  Other than that no problems.  Clean facilities, no creepy guys in the locker room, and an overall \"get in and get out\" atmosphere.\n\nThe price is probably the biggest thing to highlight in this review.  I pay 10 bucks a month with a yearly 60 dollar fee, which is the only reason I would stay a member of this big box of a gym.",

  "text": "Not a safe establishment for children. I visited this Jump time and was immediately startled by the lack of cleanliness and staff for a children's play place. My son had a Groupon for just this location and the reasons are apparent because of the age and bad condition. Before I even sat down my 12 year old grandson hurt his neck on a jump do to another child's illegal flipping. Upon his injury, my son (a PA at Primary Health) examined him and decided to take him to St Luke's ER. The staff seemed unhappily obligated to come and take a less than minute report of the incident in their notebook. We decided I would stay with my 7 year old grandson while my son took the oldest to the hospital. While awaiting the report and return of my son I became increasingly concerned about the safety and lack of cleanliness of this facility. The food was very unappetizing and high priced. The staff, whom was hard to distinguish between staff and customer, did not seem to be concerned for the safety of the children. After having to remain there for an ungodly 3 hours I will never take my grandchildren back there. When my son returned from the ER with my oldest grandson the staff did not even inquire about his well being. Beware or be aware of a place for children.",

  "text": "I arrived about an hour early to enjoy their facilities.I was greeted warmly by the receptionists. The first thing to note was how tiny the reception area was, and how cramped the entire spa felt, with treatment rooms adjacent to the locker rooms, and a narrow hallway adjoining all. The receptionist was polite and directed me to the locker room, but did not give me a basic tour of the facilities until I asked. \n\nShe essentially gave me a cursory run-through, but without showing me how to turn the dry sauna into a steam sauna,nor even putting the jacuzzi on for me ( I had to come back out to ask her how to put it on, and then she showed me the dial). She failed to direct me to the existence of a \"relaxation room\", which at first, I honestly thought was a break room for the spa staff. I was expecting a detailed tour of the entire facilities, how to best enjoy each, and to be shown everything ,so that I could relax without having to walk into the reception area each time I had a question. \nThe lockers in the locker room were tiny, and all the robes honestly looked a bit worn out (but very plush). I waddled over to the jacuzzi, which is deafeningly loud. The jets are strong, but diffuse. I moved over to the sauna after, and then waited by the pool, where I filled out the intake form. A huge note of disappointment in retrospect was that no one had directed me to where water could be found during my initial \"tour\", which I should have drank after going through the sauna and Jacuzzi.  Beverages and  a sparse select of fruits were located in the relaxation room, which I was never even pointed out to in the beginning.\n\nI followed Yalonda, the masseuse for the session, into a dimly lit and comfortable treatment room. She was very polite, and very respectful of covering the parts that she was not working on. I was feeling a little parched in the middle of the session, so she got me a glass of water in the middle of the treatment. I loved how her strokes were very firm, as I requested, and she focused on the areas that I had the most tension. The massage was exceptional, moving me into a comfortable nirvana; she devoted the entire time to the treatment.. What I did not appreciate was how when I asked about the body treatment ceiling water spouts, she described their use, but distastefully added \"it's quite expensive, though\". Sure, I came in on a group on and I'm a student, (which I never told her). But noting the price of a treatment when a client asks about it, assuming that a client cannot afford something, was sort of rude to me. This sentiment was reiterated by Sarah, the pedicurist (although after conversation she knew I was a student and clearly had a good rapport with me to give me this little factoid). \n\nI went after to the relaxation room, a small, uncomfortable setting, with very outdated magazines. I waited for a few minutes until Sarah, the pedicurist, took me to the second treatment room. Sarah is very gregarious and chatty. However, because my goal for the day was to relax by absorbing and focusing on the treatment itself, I sort of did not want to be talking the entire time; I felt a little forced into conversation, when I truly just wanted to sit back, relax and read a magazine. However, chatting with Sarah did not fully detract from the experience. \n\nThe biggest complaint I have of my entire session at Balance was how I *SPECIFIED* on my intake form that I am ALLERGIC TO LATEX. You would expect that a high end spa would have non-latex gloves to cater to individuals with these allergies. However, Sarah used a latex glove on her right hand, because she had a small cut on it. She said she \"would not touch me then, and not put her hand in the water\". \n\nDoes anyone at the spa read the intake form, and communicate such a concern? When she initially said that, I was offended that my medical need was being brushed aside. She did not touch me with her latex hand, but did occasionally brush my feet with it. I am glad that she did wear a glove to prevent contact of her wound with the basin water, but, the glove should have been another material. She took off her latex glove later when she massaged my feet with rather relaxing massage oils. Her technique is very on point and she did not rush through the procedure. I was left to relax for about 10 minutes with paraffin wax and a soothing aromatherapy neck pillow; finally, I was able to soak in the effects of my spa day in quiet. Her nail application, afterwards, however, is not the best that I have seen. \n\nI would return only on a group-on,which is what I used for this visit. Improvements are needed to make the entire experience flow smoother, especially in regards to acquainting clients with the facilities, their use, and location of the relaxation room.",

  "text": "I was a member of the Aquatic Fitness center for five plus years before they moved over to the Future Fitness facility powered by Aquatic Fitness. I didn't have to go through any of the hard sells. They just transferred my membership over at decently priced fixed rate with a contract. \n\nFuture Fitness is an attractive gym. They usually have enough machines that I can get on what I am looking for in some part of the gym. The equipment is fairly new and a lot of the machines have TV's. The locker rooms and shower areas are very nice and kept fairly clean. There is a sauna, a saltwater pool and a hot tub. I wish I used these more but I don't.\n\nMy wife and I do some of the classes. There are some limited good general fitness and spinning classes at decent times. They have yoga, and Zumba classes also which I don't do. The thing I do not like is that members can't use kettle bells, TRX, ropes, etc., unless they take an additional pay class or use a personal trainer. I don't get that.\n\nThe two things I miss about the Aquatic fitness center are one, there were more boot camp/cross fit classes at no extra charge at the old location. Future Fitness has gotten away from that but there is pay for class TRX style class. I am already paying over $45.00 per month so this doesn't appeal to me. Aquatic fitness used to have treadmill-running classes that were pretty cool also, none at FF. Secondly, Aquatic Fitness also had more athletes as members compared to just people trying to work out a little to lose weight and weight room types.  There is nothing wrong either of these and I admire people trying to better their health, but I just liked the more athletic feel at Aquatic Fitness. \n\nFuture Fitness does have a few very good instructors, Lucy and Diva are excellent. Some of the classes offered in the evening are just OK at best. They are pushing their pay classes and small group sessions instead.\n\nI have never had to deal with the sales people, but all of the people at the front desk are great. They also let me freeze my membership during the summer when I am riding and not using a gym. As a member, you can use any of the other Future Fitness locations. Just be ready for the sales tactics and aware of the exit/cancellation policy.\n\nP.S. I left Future Fitness in November of 2015 and the exit was surprisingly painless.",

  "text": "I spend a lot of time at the Maryland Farms YMCA as a tennis member there. I love the atmosphere and the friendly staff, it always feels like a home away from home.  The courts are in excellent condition and the reservation system works like a charm, with the desk calling  you back when there is an opening and you've put your name on the waiting list during peak times. I love that there are armchairs around a TV that always plays the tennis channel, and I even love more the Subway and Juice Bar inside the facility. \n\nThe reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I find it a bit pricey. Yes, you get some nice benefits with a tennis membership, like free court time and a reduced rate for lessons with the pros as well as league play, but it is still a lot of money. I feel like a non-profit like the YMCA should not have to be this expensive. I also feel at the price they charge, they should do more to dry outdoor courts right after it rains, especially on NALTA play days, reschedule their leaf blowing to a different time than NALTA and USTA play, and put water coolers on every court (it is quite far to get to the water fountains and ice dispensers from some of the outdoor courts).\n\nOther than that, I can highly recommend this YMCA and especially the tennis club.",

The instructor was fantastic, music was upbeat and kept you going even when every muscle in your body was protesting. \n\nPlace was clean and everyone was super friendly. There were several of us who were there for the first time and the instructor took the time to explain the machine to us and split us up so that we were near \"regulars\" who we could look to for guidance during class. Having said that, I can't say that I disagree with some of the lesser rated reviews especially for people who are just getting in shape. The class is very fast paced and the machine does take some getting used to. To be fair, if you read all the info on solidcore's site, they state that although all fitness levels are welcome, you should be able to hold a plank for 1 minute before coming to your first class and that it does take some time to get used to the machines.\n\nMy instructor, Kelly, did a great job of correcting my form during class as did one of the more experienced attendees who was on the machine next to me who also gave me some tips throughout class. \n\nI was surprised not to see any beginner classes offered at any of the locations and agree with other reviewers that these should be offered regularly and would likely increase membership numbers and comfort level for first timers, but overall had a great experience and will definitely be back!",

I do think the kids goof off too much in the class which is my only criticism.  I think the teacher needs more help in the class but i think this is a really nice find in Springfield Township and i'm happy it's here.",

  "text": "I have been member of this gym for a few months and I liked it. At the end of the summer I decided to cancel my membership. I sent the request to cancel my membership at the end of September, however they have been charging me the fees during October November and December. When I realized I called the gym and the staff provided Jennifer's email address, the Manager. I sent emails to her with no answer. I went to the gym to speak in person with them. I spoke with Carlise, he was very helpful, he was able to fix my status and give me explanations of what happened. But to get the refund he told me I needed to speak with Jennifer. I have been calling her and or she is not in the gym, or she is not available and she doesn't  call me back. I think the manager service is very very poor.",

  "text": "The impression I got from this gym and from the guy I toured with (I think his name was Mike?) was that they want a very particular type of client. I guess, they want people who are into crossfit-like culture but don't want to pay crossfit prices? I'm not sure exactly.\n\nI think their target audience is people who want to join a social cult-ish group of workout people who obsess over their bodies as their new hobby. Not really my deal, I like to read the newspaper in between sets. \n\nThey really empasized their big group and small group classes, all of which cost extra.\n\nI think they said it was $65 for a membership that includes spinning classes (and other classes, but not the small/big group classes) and $55 for just the cardio and weight equipment. \n\nI may have been tempted, but they were very shady when I asked about a trial membership. You basically have to give them your credit card info and it will autobill you unless you cancel in writing or something. In any case, if you've ever been a member at any gym in the 2000s, you know this is a dangerous proposition. \n\nIt's a decent gym in a convenient location, just be very wary of the particulars, especially when it comes to trial memberships.",

The accommodations, like lockers, bathrooms, food, and water, were all very nice, and would be great if you were a regular.

As far as the trainers, I haven't had a chance to try classes w every single one of them but mannnn - Jocelyn,Gina,Manny and of course CHARLES - are completely amazing !!!!!!- I have struggle a lot w my weight, my confidence, the way I see myself and even the embarrassment that I mAke myself feel. In this place I have not only found motivators, trainers and fit people to look up to I have also found people That I trust and I can honestly say I consider part of lifestyle change. I love Gina's energy and awesome positive attitude she is always super happy and legit worries about u and what works best for ur body.  Jocelyn is incredible she is sooooo funny she makes me feel comfortable and she keeps me in check - she is someone w a beautiful inside and outside - next is Charles ... well this man continues to hear my every failing attempt to loose weight and sometimes i believe that he has more faith in me than myself, he has been my trainer and my friend I love being around him even when he kicks my ass- he is brutally honest and anything I ask to work on he always manages to drop in every work out - he keeps me in check and focus even in my bad days. He is crazy and he will make u have a great workout every single time - these people are amazing and know what they are doing - if u need motivation, a good workout and want to surround urself w amazing people this is the place !!!!!!!!!",

Antonio and Alex are my favorite, but really they are all amazing. I never enjoyed running until I started taking classes at Barry's! So if even if you aren't a runner, I would still encourage you to go. The only downside is, it's expensive. You do get what you pay for though -- it's the best workout class I've ever been to. I just can't afford to go more than twice a month. \n\nBackground story: I used to be too intimidated to try this place (even though I love working out) because I thought I wasn't cool or hot enough. I went with a friend my first time and I was so pleasantly surprised. I really misjudged! The staff is super friendly, helpful, and it didn't feel cliquey at all. I tried it through \"class pass\" and loved it! I have been going twice a month for 5 months! If I reach my 2.5 mile goal I always treat myself to a protein smoothie from their \"fuel bar.\" Now THOSE are a good deal. $7 for really high quality ingredients and at least 30 grams of protein. The blueberry cobbler is my favorite!",

At Green Hills Y, you will see some lovely ladies who get matching gym attire and are working out in pearls and perfectly coiffed hair. Which, I'm all for if that's what you are into, but it definitely threw me off on my first visit :)\n\nThe Y has plenty of parking with some in the back up the hill close to the cardio equipment and aerobics classes. They also have an outdoor/indoor pool and plenty of weight machines. \n\nThe classes are great; Chris teaches a kickboxing class on Tuesdays at 6:30 and a weights class on Wednesdays that are always a killer workout. Missy teaches 2 classes on Mondays and YOU WILL SWEAT. She's tough!!\n\nMy biggest complaint is that they charge extra if you take Pilates. However, they offer Yoga and aerobics included in the membership and offer a good amount of variety for whatever you are in the mood for. Green Hills is in my rotation, and always provides a great work out!",

Bathrooms are stocked really well!\n\n2. Katie and Bri are awesome instructors. They have so much energy in class that it makes me wonder if they have any left for the rest of the their lives. (Maybe they are secretly superheroes!) They are good at providing corrections/tips during class also, which I really appreciate.\n\n3. It's a great workout! You start with 15 min or so of conditioning- think Bootcamp. Then you stretch and move into bag work. So fun! You can go at your own pace, so it's good for beginners and more advanced fitness people. That probably lasts about 30 min. You end with 5 min of partner work and then stretching. \n\n4. The trial classes are a great deal. They will try to sell you memberships to be in their \"family\". They are a little more aggressive than most fitness studios I have been to, but they are not pushy either. \n\n5. The classes always have the same structure. While it's a great workout, I really like variety. I would want to incorporate this 1-2 times a week, but I'm not sure I would be into this every day as my only workout. (I am currently still on my trial classes, and going to explore class pack options when I use them.)\n\n6. They recently expanded their schedule, but they only have one 7am class (tuesday I think) on their schedule and nothing earlier. I am hoping for early morning classes at 6am. That would be a way they could get me to be a member for sure. \n\n\n\nDefinitely go check this place out. There aren't really other kickboxing studios like this currently in the city.",

  "text": "Ever since the renovations on the first floor, Pottruck has become a much better place to workout.  All the machines have TVs on them which makes the mundane task of running in place more enjoyable.  However, my favorite thing about Pottruck are the group exercise classes. Membership rates for the classes (if you're a Penn undergrad) are extremely cheap compared to those of other gyms and they offer a variety of classes throughout the day (Pottruck in general is \"free\" aka included in your tuition if you're an undergrad, but you have to pay a fee just to enter and use the machines if you're a grad student or part-time).    Times are early in the morning 7:30 AM or earlier, midafternoon at 12 and 12:30 PM and afternoon/night from 4 to 7:30 PM.  These include classes such as spinning, body pump (weights class), body combat (similar to kickboxing), Zumba, and some pilates and yoga classes.  There's another rate you have to pay for more advanced pilates and yoga classes, but I've never looked into those so I don't know much about it.  You can also take dance classes and I'm sure there's a lot more to explore! \n\nThe main problem I have with pottruck is that it gets extremely crowded at peak hours (late afternoon classes) to the point where you either have to get to a class really early and wait outside until it starts of wait a while for a machine.  I wish that had a sign up sheet online like some other clubs have, but I'm not so sure that would work at a club like this.  The also run out of towels frequently. It may not necessarily even be at just peak hours, because it seems pretty random when they do and don't have towels available.\n\nIf you're a Penn student, I suggest you check out this gym at least once during your time here, because it really is a great facility and you should exercise anyway (gotta stay healthy!).  Also, you'll regret missing out on a great deal when you see the price of other gyms.",

I joined in January and was a little wary about the price at first, but after taking class found it was worth every penny. \n\nSince joining, I've taken classes in different places all over the country and this studio is by far the best and here's why:\n\n-The people are amazing. From the coaches, to the SA's, to the other members, everyone there is so kind and encouraging. It's such a positive environment to be in and I'm excited to go everytime.\n-They cater to every fitness level. As an ex-athlete, these workouts push me like I used to be pushed by my coaches in school. But they also provide tons of alternative lifts on the weight floor for beginners, and you can adjust your workouts to fit you.\n-You can see/track your progress. With coaches who help you evaluate your numbers, periodic benchmarks, and voluntary fitness challenges, it's so fun and easy to watch yourself grow and never become complacent.\n-Workouts are diverse. Yes, the weight floor, rower, and treads will be components of every class, but there are different focuses each day (endurance, strength, power, and different combos of each) to keep your body on its toes, and always being challenged.\n\nYour first class is free, so even if you're a little interested I highly recommend you check out the studio, meet some people, and see how you like a workout!",

We've re-upped our membership on several occasions thinking that surely the convenient location could make it worth it.  But no it does not!! I will continue to avoid this place and drive much farther to go anywhere but here.\n\nHolly K - your review above is SPOT ON!  Having dealt with the \"M\" that you refer to, you are completely right the the only place this women should work is in a prison camp.  After being members for 22 years and after being yelled at by the Clubs membership manager, we were actually forced to physically come down and pick up what I can only assume was an old fashioned ditto copy of a cancellation form in order for them to eventually cancel our membership.  We cancelled because of \"M\". \n\nIf you are a shareholder in this club and reviewing these reviews, you should definitely consider firing everyone and starting over.  Everything bad about this Club trickles down from management.",

Talked to a fitness consultant, super friendly, and let me get on my way.\nCardio equipment is super clean, and they have way too much. \nLocker room is like being at a country club, as nice as one of the larger gyms that charges more.\nFrom the locker I made my way to pool, and this is one of the best pools I have swam in.\nOverall, great gym and their rates are beyond competitive.\nOn my way out, got me a smoothie, and wow, this is good.\nMight wake up with a lot of muscles tomorrow.",

  "text": "Those who get bored easily like me are going to love the class options, which is $50 a month for access to all of them. The next tier down is $30 a month and then $20 a month is the cheapest one. \n\nOne of the classes offered is an \"orange theory\" style class, and those fitness centers charge an upwards of $150 a month. So to me, the burn zone class alone is totally worth the $50 membership. The gym is large and fairly spread out with more than enough cardio machines and a decent amount of weights. There's also a cardio theater where you can run and watch a movie, a cycle studio and a recovery zone with hydrotherapy massage beds. Each locker room has a dry sauna in it as well. \n\nLike many others, I came from Gold's gym (which is now closed) and while I miss that gym, this one offers pretty much the same amenities I'm use to using at Golds. There is no pool or basketball court so if you enjoyed those amenities you're better off joining a YMCA. But they have cycling classes and the Les Mills  classes like Body Pump. \n\nThe downside of this gym is that it get fairly crowded especially since the highway 50 location is permanently closing. Around the time of 4:30-7 there aren't even enough parking spaces. I have a feeling this will fizzle out soon though as most people don't stay consistent.\n\nI do not like the size of the women's weights area. I miss the one at Golds. Not only is it very small, it's very dark in there as well.",

There's a pretty large-size room filled with cardio equipment, weight machines, and free weights.

The workout consisted of various stations: jump rope, lunge & weight, high knees on hanging bag, punching bag, planking, noodle abs, TRX and battle ropes among others.\n\nJordon, the owner, and his team, Marshall and Jess, were fantastic coaches, correcting, encouraging, watching my form, offering modifications, always making sure that I was not only getting my butt kicked but also having fun. \n\nReno Kicks has all you need for a killer workout and the location, on a visible corner in the up-and-coming Pine Street neighborhood, is perfect and accessible for those who work in downtown. It is currently open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. but they will be opening soon at 5.30 for those early birds who like to squeeze in a workout before heading to work.\n\nThey have a mini fridge for a quick after workout snack and offer protein bowls and other items from BFF cafe. I am a big fan of their peanut butter protein balls. They are quite the treat and a healthy reward after a workout.",

  "text": "I've been a member here for four years. I love this gym and I love that I can go to any LA Fitness, which is great when traveling throughout the US.\n\nMt Laurel's pros: 1.The staff, especially the trainers - I've worked with Kenny and Kraig. Both are great, giving me workouts that are challenging but not beyond my capabilities - I don't know what's worse, not feeling like you've gotten your money's worth or not being able to move for days after the workout! I've had a very positive experience with both trainers - they are pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful. Workouts are always different and have progressed with my skill level. My experience with all of the staff in general is a positive one. I'm greeted every day with a big smile and a, \"good morning!\" I love the trainers, and have enjoyed the enthusiasm of the class instructors.\n2. Classes  - although I currently don't take advantage of the various classes - these days I usually just workout with a trainer and do some cardio - I have in the past participated in many of the classes and have enjoyed them all. Still have yet to do a cycle class, but am looking forward to starting this spring.\n3. Care of equipment and facility - this is a very busy gym. Because it is such a high volume, it can get pretty dirty quickly. Staff is constantly cleaning. On the whole, I think they do a pretty good job. Also, because of the constant use, the cardio equipment does brake down, but it's usually fixed pretty quickly.\n\nMt. Laurel's cons: 1. Lack of appropriate space and equipment for training workouts. In traveling around and going to different LA Fitnesses throughout the country, I've seen what other locations offer and feel that this is the Mt Laurel location's biggest weakness. Most other LA Fitness gyms have a dedicated area for training, not just a little corner by the locker rooms. I was impressed with a few locations that each had a very large area with multiple sets of equipment for both members working out alone and those with trainers. Because there was ample room and equipment, the equipment didn't travel all over the gym and disappear, which seems to be a big problem in Mt Laurel. The more I see other gyms, the more surprised I am that the powers that be haven't done something to resolve this issue. This facility has a high volume of trainers and clients - it seems to me to be a lot more than other locations - yet very limited space and equipment for them. For this reason, I can't give five stars. \n2. Updating needed. Although the staff does a good job maintaining the equipment and facilities, because of the constant use and high volume, things are getting a bit run down and need a bit of updating. Maybe they should also look at expanding, adding a space for personal training and more cardio.",

But this gym just clicked with me. I came for boxing originally, and those classes were amazing too, but I fell for CrossFit!\n\nOliver makes CrossFit so accessible for everyone (love the Lean/scaled versions available for every workout!). He pushes you to work hard and improve, but he doesn't push you blindly into injury as some gyms do by encouraging you to do too much too fast. He's so kind and friendly and really knows his stuff when it comes to form etc.\n\nPlus, love the other CrossFitters at this gym. It's a really nice community of cool, supportive people. No one is trying to be over-macho and intimidating like at some gyms (even though there are some total beasts that go here!). Everyone is down to earth, chill, and welcoming. \n\nIf you've ever considered CrossFit but backed out bc you were intimidated, this is the place for you! You'll be welcomed no matter your experience. And you get 3 free classes to start with, so you can get a feel for it before you sign up.",

I had been a member of LA Fitness before and stopped by to check it out again.  \n\nThe location has been expanded and offers more cardio and weight equipment.

Also, when I first joined they sucked me in with a low initial rate then increased it every year without notice.  Also, had my credit card stolen which was the one that I paid their dues with. And for a few months their billing was declined because I had a new number.  So instead of them reaching out or telling me when I walked in door day after day, they wait 3 months until you I was delinquent, they start reaching out to me then of course, telling me they are sending me to collections, then charged me monthly late fees and didn't even tell me that.  Next if you want to cancel you can't call or email, you MUST walk in personally complete their form then they charge you Another cancellation fee.  This is the worst Gym I have ever experienced on all levels. And I even said to them if you refund the late charges I will stay...and they said no. So instead of keeping a customer they lost one, which in my opinion they can't afford because their stock price and performance is just as bad as their facilities: Ticker CLUB if you want to look for yourself. Planet fitness is a way better choice and a better stock....lol. Find another gym to join bottom line, worst customer service experience I have ever had.",

The trainer was super friendly and really helped me feel comfortable with what I was doing. He explained everything clearly and supported me as I went. The weight section of the workout was arms and abs. It was a \"choose your own weight\" so everyone could work with what challenges them. I would recommend this studio to anyone and everyone who wants a great workout that perfectly blends cardio and weight training.",

  "text": "I'm very disappointed in billing with Banner. I went to this hospital because I was told by my doctor that they are really good with helping you out with medial bills with people who do not have medical insurance. So I went in on a Friday to ER with abdomen pain and the doctor was crap and didn't do anything for me but run labs. (I suffer from cyst ruptures on my ovaries) and he knew this. He tells me he doesn't want to do ultrasounds or xrays on me because my labs came back normal.. well fast forward to Saturday. I was rushed to Banner ER via ambulance in excruciating pain, turns out I had ovarian Torsion going on, little circulation to my left ovary and devolving an infection. So now I sit here with a 5k+ bill and was double charged for test that where done twice by two doctors on visits less than 24 hours apart.\n\nI called today after getting my bill and I asked for a payment plan. The billing dept told me the minimum they could do was $300. I said I couldn't afford that. Then they said they could do $209. I still cant afford that. I told them that I can make monlthy ,but not what they are asking. I was told they wouldn't accept them and that I would be sent to collections and that a machine decides when....\n\n\nSo ridicoulous!! I am trying to pay my medical bills. I have a life, other bills, a 4 month old daughter to take care of and I'm going affect my credit because they wont work with me. This hospital needs to be more realistic with billing for people who don't have insurance. At least I was trying to pay, but now I realize why pay if I'm going to be sent to collections anyway? Might as well not pay and send me anyways! :)",

I've seen kids enjoying classes to grandmothers punching bags, there is something for everyone here.  Kids take classes in martial arts and learn life skills like discipline, respect and confidence.  I've seen amazing results from their KUT program with people slimming down, becoming healthy and glowing with their results.  The KUT program uses a combination of classes for maximum results, and works with your diet educating everyone on healthy choices.\nMy favorite class is a strength training class that they do with bands.  My upper body is much more toned since taking the class.  I also enjoy their kickboxing class, where I get to work on my form and technique.  The instructors are always there to help you out and support you.  I feel so good about myself after every class that I take here.\nThere is a reason that this place has been voted #1 in Santa Barbara as the Best Martial Arts School.  They get results and they want you to show up.  This place is for your entire family and it is run by a family.",

More than a year had passed since I'd joined so cancelling should have been straightforward. 6 months, a dozen phone calls, two trips to the gym and a call to Visa later, I've finally blocked them from charging me. First I cancelled over the phone, which was excellent and had our relationship ended there - 5 stars! Then went I went to climb on day pass a few months later and was told that the person who took my previous call shouldn't have cancelled my membership as notification was required in writing. So they back-charged me and told me this and that and the other... I thought the situation was resolved but wasn't as attentive to my bills and I could have been; another few months passed. Eventually I got written confirmation from PRG that my membership would be cancelled. When the next charge appeared a few weeks later, I gave up and called Visa to contest it.

What I don't like is the inconsistent heart rate monitors, the location, and the cost. When the whole premise of the OTF group class is being in the orange heart rate zone, but your heart rate monitor doesn't work half the time, it ruins the experience. Add the expensive price tag, and it's just not worth it. For someone who can afford $160+/month gym membership and who lives 10 minutes away, definitely give it a try. It really was a great workout, but after giving it a try for 3 months, it was too expensive and too far away for me to continue my membership.",

  "text": "I've been a Y member in a number of other cities, so when I moved to St. Louis, I was excited to check this one out. I made an appointment and went in for a tour with Sal. Before I could go on the tour, I was handed a piece of paper to fill out, which asked for some really personal information - date of birth, driver's license number, employer and contact info, etc. in addition to phone number and address. I told Sal I wasn't comfortable giving all of that out without even knowing if I was going to join yet. He said it was required. I asked why, and he kept referring to \"policy\" and that he'd be happy to show me the policy. I politely explained that I believed him that it was in fact policy, but that what I was looking for was the reason behind it. He actually said, \"Well, I wasn't in the room when that policy was made, so how would I know?\" I was pretty irritated by this point, so I asked what the minimum information was that I could give in order to receive a tour. He said I could leave off my employer but that was it. He then said he needed my ID and to do a background check. I said I'd be happy to do all of that once I joined, but that I wasn't going to do all of that for a tour. He said, \"Yes you are, and I'm going to take your picture too.\" I walked out.\n\nI'm not sure if this is all truly YMCA policy or if it was merely Sal's delusion. YMCA, either fire Sal OR, if you really feel that the general public is so untrustworthy as to require an actual background check and the disclosure of extremely personal information before literally walking them through a couple of rooms WITH A STAFF MEMBER, then I don't wish to be a member of your organization any longer. I found a different gym that's also cheaper.",

Only reasoning I gave four instead of five stars was because the space was so small compared to their number if members, it was cramped! Not necessarily a bad thing for them, but I felt like I was always in someone's way! :(  I'm sure it's difficult finding large space in a city though too. I would still recommend them, maybe just try a less popular WOD time- I went in the evenings.",

  "text": "Crossfit Roux just recently opened in Playmakers Indoor Sports- Southshore. Bradley, the owner, is a certified Crossfit trainer who has done a really incredible job of setting up the gym. \nThere are a few things that make Crossfit Roux stand out from other Crossfit gyms:\n1. The price! It is lower than any other quality Crossfit gym I have seen. There are discounts for teachers, first responders, musicians, students, and members if the military.\n2. Few Crossfit gyms are air conditioned- and this is a huge benefit for our New Orleans summer months.\n3. This is one of the most women-friendly gyms I have been to ever. There is a women-only boot camp class!! Mothers can bring their teens for free to do a work out alongside them- which not only is convenient for moms, but it encourages a healthy lifestyle at a young age.\n4. There is a strong focus on health here. Several times Bradley has said something along the lines of, \"the way most gyms do this movement puts a lot of strain on shoulder muscles and can really damage your shoulder, so we won't do it that way in this gym.\" This demonstrates what is trying to be done at this gym: help people lead a healthy, strong lifestyle through Crossfit.\n5. The classes are capped at 12 people, where many other gyms are 20. This means more attention to you as you perform some complicated movements. Bradley is very in tune with everyone's levels of ability and suggests scaled versions for you- and demonstrates everything!\n\nI highly suggest you sign up for classes at Crossfit Roux- even if you haven't done Crossfit before, there will be classes to go over the fundamentals of Crossfit. Reach out to Bradley at krewefitness.com",

The workout that Dan gave us was superior in my opinion and challenging. He was clear in his instruction, motivating and offered alternatives. This was designed for an  advanced participant. Although the main gym is air-conditioned, the boot camp was given in a building off to the side that is not. They had a small fan and a large door was left open for ventilation. The heat was draining for me and this was in November so just keep that in mind if you have issues with heat and stay hydrated.  Water and towels are provided, which I thought was nice.",

Please complete the form below to receive a FREE 3-day pass and special offers sent directly to your inbox.\" I was pretty excited to try the gym out and thought that if the gym was awesome, I would refer my brother and his family. I showed up at the gym at 6:30am, it was not busy at all, and was told I would not be able to utilize the trial as I myself am not a local resident with a local ID. This was NOT stated on the website, but, it was stated in small print at the bottom of the pass sent to my inbox. As I had already read the info. on website, I didn't think to double check the fine print on the pass sent to my inbox. In my opinion, good customer service is transparent. Also, I would have thought the front desk person would have been a bit more accommodating as I was already there at 6:30am and, again, the facility was not busy. Needless to say, I will not recommend this gym to my family new to the area.",

I complained about it on many occasions and was summarily dismissed with \"we're working on it.\"  It's beyond my comprehension how any business, let alone a gym, expects its customers to be ok with a broken air conditioner for several months during the hottest months of the year.  Their customer service is nonexistent.  I also spoke with Jeff and got nothing but a rude runaround and refusal to refund any membership fees.  Jeff is one of the rudest individuals I've ever dealt with in any setting! He's unprofessional, rude, and without any tact. \n\nTrainers and staff are conspicuously missing from the floor at Kennedy Fitness. There've been many occasions that I had a question about the correct use of equipment and couldn't find anyone to help me.  Between the broken AC problem, the lack of anything resembling customer service and absence of trainers on the floor, what the heck am I paying these people for?  \n\n Don't waste your money at this facility. There are so many other clubs that will treat you right and cost less too. I've joined a new fitness club where I'm always greeted at the door and treated with courtesy.  Don't waste your time or $$ at Kennedy. Look elsewhere if you want a good gym.",

We were charged for our April dues (while gym is closed) and then again for June (no notice the gym was reopening) however due to the COVID we relocated to a different state for work. No way to cancel our membership and as soon as we heard the gym was back open, we called to cancel. The young man at the front desk stated they needed 30 days written notice to cancel. Well, how could we do that if we had already moved and we tried and tried to contact the gym? Sooooooooo then we were charged AGAIN for June dues. My husband also had knee surgery at the end of May so he CLEARLY would not be using the gym at all until cleared to do so. \nWe had other memberships at CRUNCH FITNESS and all we did was call and they graciously cancelled our memberships and wished us well.  Thank you Crunch Fitness for your superior customer service!!!!\nSurely hope this won't have to go to litigation, as I see the owner of the gym is taking monies that the gym is not entitled to and using it to cover her expenses at the expense of the members. I would not recommend giving them any more money. \nI called and asked for the membership department was put on indefinite hold and then was advised that it might be easier to call back, so I did - two hours later - another indefinite hold and advised to call back AGAIN. \n\nNow the hubs is trying..... will update soon\n\nOk..... customer service at this place is ridiculous. Jessica in \"memberships\" in not so many words said, \"too bad, we had plenty of members who contacted us and cancelled their memberships, and offered to send us (in a different state) our \"gift cards\" to the gym for the spa and juice bar for the portion of our memberships they stole. NEVER in my life, really? Why on earth would I ever come back to this gym? She said \"read your contract - we require 30 days notification to cancel a membership\"\n\n\nRead the reviews - they're  true. We know this firsthand. \n\nNow time to contact legal. This is simply not ok.\n\n\nResponse from the complaint on BBB I FILED  - mind you NO EMAIL was sent to us regarding the reopening of the club - though my husband email was listed on his contract- \n\n\"Sports West Ahtletic Club did charge for April dues because we belived we where giong to be able to reopen on April 10th as the President was announcing on TV. When we were not able to open in April we posteded on our web site and sent out e-mails to all members saying we would refund each member in the form of a gift certificate to use for services and good in the club and our day spa when we reopen. \n\nAs for cancellation of membership, we require a 30day written notice. It is a procesess to cancell re occuring dues so in order to ensure our accuracy we use the thirty day to procees the request. Mr B agreed to send in a written notice to terminate his membership. See attatched documents. Mr B could have mailed a letter to terminate his membership any time in March, April or before May 15th to terminate his membership. The club closed on March 17th so he could have called and emailed or walked in to the club and filed out a term form before that time to canell for April and Mr. B could have mailed a letter in to Sports West any time in April and before May 14th to cancell his membership for June. We did not process any dues in May. Mr B has filled out a term form brfore as he has been a member scince May of 2019 adding and taking off people on his membership.\n\nAs far as CRUNCH FITNESS CENTER being able to cancell by a phone call, that is nice for them. We are not a corporate conglomerate with millions of dollars and grants from the government to be able to handle calls from all over the country and process them. We are a single local fitness center trying to actively support our community and utalize local busineses to do so.\n\nThere is no way we could have know that Mr. B wished to cancell his membership without some some form of communication in writting. If Mr. B would have emailed or mailed a letter we would have accomidated his request right away. \n\nIt is sad that Mr. B resorted to defamatory accusations on social media trying to hurt a local business when all he had to do was write a letter as he agreed to. \n\nAs for a refund If Mr B could send us an official termination letter by mail or e-mail and take down the defamatory post on Yelp. We will consider a refund.\"\n\nWe received no notification of the gym reopening and we did try to call and discuss it with the gym at the time of the closure. No information was given AND then we had to move due to his knee injury and jobs. \n\nI've worked for many \"small businesses\" and we support small business - but even the owner stating that they \"thought\" they would be re-opening doesn't give them the right to charge members for services not available.",

How freaking genius!! Each of the instructors came in and did a preview of the classes they instruct, and I got to try out a really fun \"dance it out\" class with an instructor I had never had. Awesome!! I only wish I had more time that day to try out some other classes! I've never seen a Y do this, so it really made them stand out to me. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their classes, I really enjoy everything this Y has to offer!",

  "text": "For the most part, yelping requires a lot of eating, so there's got to be something to counteract the more negative effects of that pastime. That's where 12th Street comes in! And wait, I can yelp about it too? Double wow.\n\n12th Street is, I think, one of the most affordable gyms in Center City. Full disclosure: as a student, I paid $350 for a year membership and was waived the initiation fee. And all the classes are included, as well as two personal training sessions, which I haven't used yet but am totally excited to! Isn't it sooo Kardashian to have a personal trainer? :) This gym wouldn't be Kim's cup of tea though, cos while the facilities do the job, it's nothing state of the art. It's kind of like a step above an old boxing gym. I mean, everything is clean which I appreciate but I'll put it this way, nothing is shiny and new. Also, the layout is a bit strange. Someone described it as a maze, which it definitely is, with all its nooks and crannies and narrow passageways. But it's nothing too complicated that you won't know your way around after a day or two. At least I hope. \n\nSo far,  I must sound pretty tepid about 12th Street, right? But I'm just warming up like a good workout should :)\n\nI actually credit this place for revolutionizing my mentality about working out. Heretofore I was pretty \"Zen\" about exercising, as I'd just go for a long but moderately paced run on the Schuylkill Banks whenever the mood struck. In fact, all I had intended do to at 12th Street was hit the treadmills when it was too cold or rainy to go running outside. But the classes are like crack (yes I know, lazy metaphor...). They're not only intense but also loads of fun! So far, I've tried Ballet Tone, Yoga Core, Tae Bo, and spinning. Goodbye, lonely treadmill in the corner.\n\nI won't say much about Yoga Core and Tae Bo, since I think most of you know what those might entail, but I will say that the Tae Bo here is like Billy Blanks double, maybe even triple time. And if the idea of doing straight sets of roundhouse kicks to Lil Wayne appeals to you, look no further... That said, don't let Ballet Tone trick you because it's not all unicorns and cupcakes and pink tutus. It's actually a pretty effective workout, and it takes extra discipline because you're supposed to look graceful while doing it too... I loved it, especially the refreshing way music was incorporated - light, poppy fare like One Republic, Maroon 5, and TLC :) Lastly, spinning. The one-hour class with Na'Tasha is no joke... no joke at all... I was sweating like an onion! That woman will make you work! I wish I could carry a mini Na'Tasha in my pocket for homework motivation - I'd be such a better student! And the way she times the workouts to the music (so that both build up simultaneously)? That is art, dude. You'll leave that class looking like you got into a fight with a wet grizzly bear but you'll feel like a BAMF, guaranteed...\n\nAnd now for the cool-down: I have to say I'm not all too thrilled with 12th Street's night hours. They close at 11 on weekdays which is aite, but at 10, 8, and 7 on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, respectively. Maybe they're just watching out for my social life that I'm not hitting the gym when I should be hitting the dance floor, but I'll make that decision thank you!",

The gym looked very nice and everything was going great until the staff became very rude. Ted, who was at the front desk, was very rude and short with me after I let him know that I had a trial period and I wanted to check\nIn to workout. His looks could have killed, just a very rude guy. I felt like saying if you don't like your job then go get another one. Other than the staff, the gym is nice. However, I do not want to spend my money and get the rude treatment. I made it to the second day of the 7 day trial period and I never went back. I enjoyed the first day though.",

The community provided a lot of support to one another, which is always a great vibe to feel in a new gym. Definitely felt comfortable here. \n\nBest of all, they provided a great workout! Frank and Julia gave us plenty of time to warm up and then reviewed all the standards for the class.

  "text": "Too. Freakin. Crowded.\n\nThis LA Fitness gets very crowded in the early evening, to the point where is it difficult to find a free locker or machine.  The locker room looks beautiful, but it is poorly laid out, so that you constantly have to excuse yourself to get past other members. The only way I manage to get a workout in a reasonable amount of time is to just use whatever station happens to be open; waiting for specific machines would take too long.  \n\nThe facility overall is fairly nice, primarily because it is only a few years old.  I see some evidence that the management isn't putting enough into maintaining the place, but time will tell.  I don't have any complaints about the equipment quality. The temperature is always comfortable. Most of the members and staff are polite.  I've used their babysitting service (the Kids Klub) a handful of times and my daughter seems to like it. I pay $18 per month, but I've had other members tell me that they pay more or less than I do; apparently you need to negotiate when you sign up.",

  "text": "This gym (and I am speaking for this, Arch St. and Fitler Sq locations) is a bad one to get involved with. I have just FINALLY ended my relationship with them and they have put me on a delightful 2 month waiting period, which basically means they are squeezing two more monthly fees out of my checking account before they will release me from my month-to-month contract after 4 years of uninterrupted payments. Then they called and offered me 2 free months if I stay. \n\nIt's like being in a bad relationship. You want out. You try to get out, but they won't let you go and try to manipulate you into staying even after they force you to stick around. It's hard to even wrap my mind around how that could be a good business model. They have a TERRIBLE reputation. When I signed up for my new gym, I was like a battered wife. I asked them a thousand questions and was outrageously suspicious of the contracts and their membership terms. They knew I had come from Sweat. \n\nBeyond the horrible terms and policies, the gym itself is just okay. The classes in South Philly are good enough. There are days when the music doesn't work, the fan doesn't work, etc. My first ever group fitness class there was conducted without music - an hour of bootcamp in silence other than the grunts and pants of your sweaty neighbors. \n\nThe locker rooms are abysmal. I would NEVER shower there. Yikes. There is mold on the showers at Arch Street. There's a handicapped chair in one of the stalls that is literally brown with mold. That must be lovely for the person who needs it to sit on. There are many days I'd hop on one, two, three treadmills at either location before I found one that functioned properly. They all have TVs but you never know which 2 fuzzy channels might come in. The wifi NEVER works so streaming spotify or pandora while you work out is not happening unless you have a monster data plan. \n\nAnd to make all of this more delightful, the atmosphere is really not conducive for women to enjoy a workout without being leered at. The weights are strategically placed between the group ex studio and the cardio so the guys who are \"resting\" on the bench between sets can take their pick of what to stare at before they return to slamming their weights on the ground.",

Who did they get their black belt under and are they IBJJF certified?  \n-Do the coaches compete or have they competed?  Did they win?\n\nHope this helps you in making the right decision for you!

That's for the white card I supposed. Go upgrade it! It's worth the money, IF you are commited. Only $20 per month. Not sure how is it with white card but with black card every drink is only $1. Plus you get to use tanning and massage unlimited. As well with bringing guest. No charge for the guest and it's unlimited as well. And you can use the black card in any Planet Fitness location.\n\nThe only down side about this place is people hanging out and chatting it up with their buddies. I can't believe when I saw even a personal trainer just stood there and start yapping it up with his client for over half hour. That's damn annoying. Especially when he start hang out around treadmills.\n\nGo here if you want to work out. Just stay at home or go next door at pet store if you just want to hang out or talking.",

I have joined their Spa & Fitness membership, which gives me access to their state of the art yet private fitness center and pool, steam sauna, as well as a massage or facial a month at a significantly affordable price. It's a well kept secret in the city, and most times people truly do not know what to expect. This is not a holistic fancy shmancy spa. It is a great fitness center, with nice amenities, and the added bonus of a full service spa on location. I alternate between massages with Dr. Tom or Chiane and facials with Emma each month, and treat myself to a manicure with Nath here and there. Nath is the best!! Being a member also guarantees you discounted prices on all ur services. It's a small amount I put away for myself each month that makes me feel spoiled, pampered and taken care of.

Luckily for me, I was fortunate enough to be nearby this gym.\n\nFor starters this place is extremely clean and well organized. When you walk in you're greeted by a friendly staff and make you feel like you're like one of the regulars. \n\nSecondly the layout is perfectly planned. There's multiple benches and squat racks so no wait regardless of what body part you're on. However that is not the best part! \n\nIn the rear back room, there's a half cage for the bumper plate cross fitters. Quite honestly this place has a little bit of everything, so whatever your reasons for coming in to the gym, there's a place for you.",

We like this location because it is has good group exercise classes, like Zumba for me, and plenty of workout equipment for the hubby.\nI find the staff polite and the place clean, which is important. The instructors are great and really get to know you. There is a lot of equipment in the gym and I enjoy the fact there is an indoor pool and lovely locker rooms. I will keep enjoying my membership with its lovely benefits and hopefully we continue to have a good experience!!",

  "text": "Pretty much everything I'd want to say has already been said in previous reviews: It's spacious, solid equipment, with friendly staff and slightly annoying but perfectly manageable parking. It's all true, but that's not what got me to finally get myself a membership: It was the Zumba classes.\n\nIf you haven't heard of it before, Zumba is essentially a combination of aerobics, dancing, and modern dance music. It's cardio focused with a relaxed atmosphere, so you don't have to be skilled or particularly coordinated to participate, although I admit I like to showoff when I can :)\n\nKim teaches an excellent Monday night class, and Samantha does a Zumba-toning class for those who want to focus on muscle tone while still moving around. Jenny does a Friday night Zumba class which is especially intense. There are also plenty of other Zumba classes, but these are the only ones I have been able to attend thus far.\n\nIn summary, I can't find anything wrong with the Downtown YMCA: It has all of the qualities of a solid gym, and helped me find an activity that lets me laugh even as I'm ready to keel over in exhaustion. I couldn't ask for more.",

I am a member here rather than somewhere else largely because they have basketball, something other health clubs lack. The other facilities are definitely excellent - it is very well maintained and staffed, cafe is great; they also have a running track. But for me the # 1 reason is basketball - a nice court, and can pretty much find a good run just about any time (though I play with a regular group of aging hoopsters). It is also very conveniently located for me, equidistant between work and home. Of course an extra plus (or minus, depending on how you look at it) is running into the Governor occasionally in his shorts.",

I personally don't mind the sun in my face while romping around the downstairs area. I'm a fan of natural light. I also love the 30 minute circuit when I'm pressed for time-- however, it sucks that some people don't follow the rules that those machines are dedicated to those who are there for the circuit (sooo, if you're one of those people, stop yo).

She was a great trainer for my wife and youngest daughter.  The other trainers look like they like their jobs, their clients and the place.  They look like they know a variety of workouts too.  Me?  I grunt through weights with my headphones on and periodically slam the punching bags.  I wish the hours were longer and the music was better, but that's what headphones are for.  Also, the snack bar doesn't seem to be open on the weekends when I really want a smoothie bad!  But I am there to workout, and always get a good one.   I think I've seen a new manager walking around?  Anyway, check it out.  Yelp always asks:  good for kids?  There is a play room for the little guys and, as I said, my teenage daughter got in great shape there.  Next time I go, I am going to ask a trainer for help.  I notice they never offer it on their own.  Is that a trainer code or something?  Or am I doing everything right?  Hey, no steroids.  I got this way naturally.  And I am a spectacle.

Compared to the three other studios I've been to, this one is brighter due to more windows than the studio configurations I've seen elsewhere.  It's roomy enough that you aren't bumping elbows on the rowers or in the weight room.  The location is great, just off Music Row on 17th Street.  It's only a mile or so from downtown, so you could easily walk or run from your downtown hotel.  It's super close to the Gulch if you want to hit up brunch and retail afterwards.  They have a cute backdrop near the reception desk if you're the selfie-talking type.  The only negative I'd note is the floors looked dusty and I could see hairs on them when i was doing floor work in the weight room.  I was there on a Sunday, so maybe they only have housekeeping on weekdays?  They have showers and lockable lockers for your stuff.  They also have a good selection of Nashville-specific OTF gear if you need some workout swag to reward yourself for getting your sweat on while on vacation.",

  "text": "I would like to give 2 1/2 stars, because while I think the staff and the instructors for the classes are terrific, the business end of this gym sucks.  When I joined, they advertised \"no enrollment fee\" and a month to month membership. A month later, I got hit with an \"annual fee\" on my credit card.  So many people complain about this, they have a recording when you call to complain that says the charge is for an annual fee listed in the fine print in your contract. \n\nThey also charge $30 a month to be able to go to the classes, but no one checks to see if you paid.  It is an honor system, so many people who haven't paid the extra fee get to go to the classes for nothing.\n\nThe so called \"month to month\" membership promotion is also a bait and switch.  To quit, you have to send a certified letter, which cost me $8 to send, and you have to give 60 days notice.  I thought this was fraudulent, and I complained to the local BBB.  I never got a response. They do have a large number of complaints against them for their sales practices.  I think someone should file a class action against them for fraudulent business practices. Buyer beware!  LA Fitness is so much more professional and much easier to work with.",

  "text": "We had been looking forward to dining here for months! First, the food and aesthetics of the restaurant were wonderful. It has an old school steak house feel, it reminded me of Crescent City Steaks, just more modern. It's so disheartening and disrespectful in 2019 to still deal with blatantly different service in a fine dining establishment due to race (it was the only difference between us and the other restaurant patrons). Especially in a city whose main economic draw is tourism. Either they don't realize you notice it or maybe they just don't give a f÷@%! I can only speak on the experience we had at this restaurant, if our treatment was due to something other than race we could not identify it. We dine out a lot, everything from holes in the wall to fine dining establishments and sadly this type of treatment is still very prevalent. We pride ourselves on being exceptional tippers 20% is our norm. I will tip a lackluster server no less than 15%. I tip this way because I understand they don't think \"we\" are tipping at all let alone tipping properly. Needless to say, we won't be back anytime soon. I will say we have dined at their sister restaurant Desi Vega and the service was amazing!",

  "text": "My first introduction to Weston was due to the DT60 promo on their website, which stands for don't think for 60 days. The package involves group training. I called in and spoke to Mike and he set me up for a visit which included an assessment, part of which was moderate exercise. Haha. Moderate my eye. lol. I think that Mike just wanted to provide a challenge, which is what a great trainer does. He was very welcoming, engaging and encouraging. \n\nAfter the assessment I began my onboarding with group trainer Scott. He was very though and challenging. He did an excellent job explaining the basics and showing me how to challenge myself. He made me feel comfortable enough to go outside of my comfort zone. I love weight traing but for some reason I have not been able to get enthused about it for almost a year. The stuff we do in group training is varied (TRX, kettlebells, planks, lunges, and other stuff) thus pushing my body in different ways. \n\nMentally it was very difficult to get myself to the class, but wow! After having my butt kicked for 40 minutes, sweating profusely I felt AMAZING!  The next day I was like \"I feel awesome today\" I had extra pep in my step. I could feel a difference immediately. After a couple of days I crave the class, but still, on the day of the class, I have to keep myself from wanting to quit, because it is tough. But I really really really love it.  Even in a group Scott is able to challenge us individually, correct our form and make sure that we are safe. \n\nOverall I am very pleased with Weston. I really hate gyms, but Weston is very comfortable. There are people of all ages shapes and sizes, no men looking at you like a pork chop. All of the staff is pleasant, including the wonderful people at reception, Kara and Adam.  They all seem to really enjoy it there. Also it is amazing that they remember member's names.   And they really seem to care about your progress, how you are doing, how are you felling, how did you feel after the last class. I also enjoy that they are up on technology, you can scan in and sign up for classes using their app.  They are very responsive via email as well. Also they send you nutrition tips from time to time. \n\nI committed myself for two months. I just completed one month. Two and done I said.  I think that I may have a new addiction. Darn it!!!",

  "text": "I had a black card membership that I opted to downgrade earlier this year. Every time I've gone in since, I have not had an issue, other than being mostly ignored by the bored-looking staff too busy checking their cell phones to notice anything else. Tonight, my card didn't work, so the girl asked for my black card (still on my key ring). For some reason that no one could explain (or attempted to find out), the black card worked. However, I was told I owed back membership fees for March and May. Now, my account was up to date, and payments are regularly charged. Why would this month be paid, but not March or May? Makes no sense. They wouldn't let me in without paying up. No investigation into the discrepancy or weirdness of it all. So, I opted to pay the bogus fees ($20+) and just cancel the membership. Let's just say this isn't the first time I've encountered truly bad customer service at this gym, and this was my last straw. When I inquired about my credit card remaining on file and said I was uncomfortable about the whole situation, the manager threatened to call police. Out of no where. And it had been a civil discussion up to that point. I'm guessing that she was tired of me asking questions to which her only response was \"I don't know.\" I was truly shocked, and just said \"Excuse me?\" She responded by laughing and calling me an offensive name, which was apparently funny to the rest of the immature staff at the counter too. On top of this appalling unprofessionalism, the gym has been a wreck for months as \"construction\" is going on. Men utilizing the gym are forced to use a port-o-potty outside ... in December. This a painfully slow project with very little actually getting done. In the meantime, customers are breathing in dust as they attempt to work out. Tonight, the tables near the entrance appeared to be the staging area for a pizza party, based on the mess. Apparently, they think customers want to see the staff's half-eaten dinner lying around. Not that it matters. The staff turns over so quickly here that you rarely see the same people month to month.",

  "text": "I initially decided to join OTF because I didn't want to go back to the indoor/outdoor Bootcamp that whipped me into shape years earlier...and at the time so many other Yelpers were checking into OTF all over Tampa Bay. I really like group Bootcamps because I need someone to tell me what to do...and kinda kick my butt. I also need variety. Doing the same thing bores me, so muscle confusion workouts are ideal for me. At first the OTF concept seemed really cool, but the thrill was gone for me within a couple of months. \n\nSome items I liked:\n\n1. Most of the trainers were fun.\n\n2. The music was motivating.\n\n3. It was nice to be able to see your monitored workout stats and how many calories you burned after every workout.\n\n4. HIIT style workouts...the strength sessions were different every day.\n\n5. Everything is indoors.\n\n\nHere's a few reasons why I'm not a fan:\n\n1. At first it was thrilling to get up to a certain rpm and changing running speed, but I got bored with the treadmill and row machines for cardio.\n\n2. I sometimes couldn't hear the trainers over the loud music.\n\n3. You are forced to buy a strap for over 20 bucks and wear a monitor during the workout. This is very gimmicky and after a month they changed the type of strap you needed and forced everyone to buy new straps. \n\n3. I had an autoimmune medical issue that was new to me that was draining all of my energy. It made my joints hurt and I was quite weak after doing anything physical, so I decide to change my membership from month to month to a certain number of workouts that I paid for up front because I didn't know when I'd be well enough to work out again. I dealt with this autoimmune issue for almost a year before I got it under control. When I felt better and decided to go back I realized I could no longer log into the app and schedule a workout. Apparently when you buy workouts up front you only have a year to use them even though you've paid for them. I didn't think this was s good policy. I messaged this facility via the app and never heard back. Zero stars for the contract. Not happy that I lost 10 workouts, but I knew I wouldn't have continued with OTF afterward.",

The only other gym I've been to that has just as good equipment is at USF but you can't really compare a gym to a division 1 college gym. I will say this, the only advantage the USF gym has is that they have more equipment; and a tibia machine which I didn't know existed until I worked out there. Not to mention it's open 24/7 and also has a boxing ring with trainers. My only complaint is that they don't have sanitation stations. Other than that, it's perfect.",

  "text": "I had a terrible experience with the customer service side of Club Fitness.  I was in St. Louis for 2 months this summer for my job, and I joined for those dates.  The gym stipulates when you join that should you like to cancel, you need to do so online and 30 days before you are charged again.  I knew when I would be leaving, so I put this in my calendar, and made sure to cancel on time.  I followed through with this and double-checked on my last day by going up to the counter, asking them to make sure my account was cancelled, and they said everything looked good.  \n\nI got back to my home in Illinois, and have been charged every month since leaving.  I called customer service, completely confused as to why I have been charged.  They claim that they have no recollection of my cancellation online, and therefore will not reimburse me.  Additionally, I asked right then and there to cancel my account immediately, they said, \"You must cancel online only, we can't do it over the phone.\"  Which probably means I will be charged again, since I need to give 30 days notice.  UNBELIEVABLE.  The confirmation email from my original cancellation no longer exists (why would it, because the gym confirmed it with me on my last day at the gym) so I have no proof that I cancelled.  It is their word against mine.  \n\nI had a nice time working out at the gym, but I have NEVER had to deal with such bad customer service in my life.  I am out a lot of money, and it was never my fault.  I say to you: stay away!!!!",

  "text": "PROS:\n1. Cute names for the classes; they rotate monthly or so, so if you can only go Thursday at 4:30, you will not be stuck doing the same class every time. They work different areas of the body, and some are total body, with varying degrees of cardio workouts.\n\n2. Lots of fun props, like the bands that hang from the ceilings\n\n3. LOVE the cheer portions. As a dancer, I find these super fun. As a girl who never made the school cheerleading team, I get to live out the dream. Like someone else said, don't let it intimidate you--you're not tossing other LIthers around or anything. It just uses cheer positions and exercises to strengthen your body.\n\n4. The food is actually really tasty. It's expensive, and there's no way I could both Lithe and afford the food all the time, but as a treat, it's great. Lithe Latte, pizza bites, cookie dough truffles (OMG), and carrot cake oatmeal are all amazing--it's all health foody, but those taste like the real thing. \n\n5. Four locations (new one just opened on the Main Line) and tons of class times--you can always find one to fit your schedule\n\n6. Showers!! Absolutely essential if you're trying to go to Happy Hour afterwards.\n\nNow, on that note...\n\nCONS: \n\n1. Lots of classes, but no guarantee you'll get in. It's so popular now that even when you book weeks in advance, you can still get put on the waitlist and never actually be put in the class. Sometimes I get out of work early, but I typically can't make a last-minute decision to go Lithe because there will be 8 people ahead of my on the waitlist. \n\n2. The music can be annoying sometimes. Some of it is pumped up gym type music with Madonna/Britney/etc or 70s mixes. Those I don't mind. Other times it's weird trendy jungle/lounge/new agey stuff that doesn't make me want to work out. Often, the music is just background, and you're not doing the exercises to the beat, which I don't like (again, former dancer--we stay on the beat.) The exception is the cardio sections, in which you do actually have to stay on beat.\n\n3. The vibe can be a little hoity-toity. I've never seen so much Lululemon in one room, with the exception of the actual Lululemon store (it's a close call, though.) One you get talking to some of the other students, they're nice, but the beginning of classes are usually people just sitting there in silence and not really yakking it up, unless they came with friends. It doesn't bother me much, but I can see how it would turn some people off.\n\n4. Price--it's expensive. But hey, if it keeps me exercising and interested, I can deal with that.\n\n5. Many of the instructors do not correct form individually, which does bother me a lot. I'm paying a lot to go to the classes, so I feel like I should be getting individual corrections/praises, but that's what's really lacking in most of the classes. Bari is the one instructor I've had so far who does do person corrections/praising, which is why she's my favorite.\n\nI just did a comparison on the Purre Barre Philly Yelp page, so you can look there for my opinion of PB versus LIthe. Overall, though, PB wins out slightly for me because I feel like I get a deeper, different kind of workout than I do at Lithe or anywhere else. Lithe is a great workout, and you can always made modifications to make it more difficult if needed, but PB just works muscles in an entirely different way. That said, I do each at least once a week and likely will continue to do so for a long time. \n\nSo if you're thinking of trying Lithe, do it! Just the variety of classes alone is a good enough reason to go. The cheer aspect is what makes it different from any other workout and what keeps me going back.",

I'm always going to be rooting for the owners here!!\n\nAlright guys, grab a drink, sit back, and get ready. It's about to get real, real quick:\n\nI had a very unfortunate experience here. I'm only in the neighborhood for a week, so I was hoping there would be a free trial, or a cheaper deal than 20 dollars a session. I just wanted to keep my routine while I'm here for work. But time after time it felt like they were doing whatever it takes to not give me something that worked out for both of us.\n\nAt one point I even said \"please\" a couple of times. I thought, you know what, when it comes to going to the gym I'll never be ashamed to use the word please - no matter how desperate it may make me look.\n\nIt didn't work.\n\nOkay - I paid the 20 bucks for the one night session, because I really needed it. But the next day I found out, if you go on the website, you can fill out a form and get a 7-day pass. What the heck? I was confused... was my 20 minute speech not clear enough for them to mention this? Were my cries not enough to be told about this option? I spoke to three different people that night - neither said a word.\n\nOh well, I filled out the form, and jogged my way back the next day. Again, it didn't work out... the form is only for the local residents, they said, and I live in NYC. But nowhere I saw that on the website (NO, I MEAN IT, Here is the link and if you find anything about the requirement of being a resident, I will personally venmo you $20 (http://go.cityfitnessphilly.com/7-day-trial)). Someone even called me after I submitted the form, and he said he'll make sure I get in. But it didn't work.\n\nAt this point I know they remembered me :D because as soon as I walked in I could tell they were annoyed  -- judging by them avoiding eye contact, and avoiding conversation with their \"sorry bro - wish I could help bro - I understand bro\"\n\nListen, if the management is reading this: we both know you're not making your money off the $20 one time sessions. It's the monthly/yearly plans that makeup your revenue. It's the people who pay the huge amount on January 1st, and never show up. But you just lost a customer who's enthusiastic about going to the gym and working out. \n\nYou had nothing to lose from letting me work out there for a day or two. I'm not even asking for free. But 60 dollars for 3 days?! \n\nI mean it when I say I want you to be a successful gym. But I showed up twice, talked to 4 people total, said \"please\" wayyyyyy more than anyone should for going to the gym...\n\nAnd I'm sorry... your $6.50 'protein shakes' were not that great to make me wanna come back.\n\nI just wish we could be friends.",

There is a shower available if you need to clean up a little after you work up a sweat. \n\nIn the lobby area, there are cubbies where you can store your things. There is not any security in place at these cubbies. They are right in front of the front desk and I have never had any issues regarding security of my things here.",

I started a personal training contract in June 2014 that was to provide sessions until late June 2015. LAF Walnut is ceasing operations on May 29, but the LAF \"customer services manager\" at corporate headquarters told me that I still need to make payments including one due days before it closes, despite the fact that LAF won't be able to hold up its part of the bargain to provide sessions at Walnut. LAF won't refund the money paid for sessions it cannot deliver either.  Apparently, LAF's \"policy\" to not give refunds outmatches its contractual obligations. \n\nMy advice to anyone interested in signing any agreement with LAF is to read the fine print carefully and reconsider.

I asked to please change it to something non-political.  Or put MSNBC on another one of the side TV's to give some balance. Asked staff several times and was told that FOX News had to be on all the time because it's what \"the people'' want.  \"What people?\", says I.  I'm a person too, aren't I?  \"Sorry.  Can't change it.\" Who says so?  The staff? The management? The members? Who is it who insists that they need to have Glenn Beck screaming at me while I try to work out?  Do they think my blood pressure isn't high enough already?  After 2 e-mails went unanswered and staff refused to change the channel -- repeatedly -- I quit and found a happy new workout home at Bally's for half the price, and a wide range of TV stations to choose from.  So much for my fantasies of a progressive, a-political, welcoming Jewish environment. Yes, they might have good day care -- can't comment on that.  But be damn sure they aren't raising your toddler to be a little fascist. The management is apparently 3 steps to the right of Genghis Khan.\nPS -- I'd be interested to know if FOX News is still the \"must watch\" TV in the gym. After quitting, I was assured by the management they would change, but don't know if that's really happened or not.",

I am not really a group fitness or class person but I have heard good things about Orangetheory and this location is near my house so I figured, why not?\n\nWhen you take a free class, you do have to arrive a half hour early to fill out paperwork, get fixed up with a heart monitor (like a fit bit) and take a short tour. The front desk person (Jess) was super nice, and went over my fitness goals with me, then introduced me to the trainer/instructor before the class. Ashley was the trainer I met with. She is really high energy and positive. She explained the process to me, where I would be for each part of the class and so on.\n\nClasses here are an hour long and divided into three parts, treadmill, rowing machine and weights/floor exercises. You rotate through each. The heart rate thing keeps track of where your heart rate is, if it is in the \"orange zone\" and so on. Apparently you want to be in the orange zone because that is where you are really pushing yourself. I was not there, but I still burned almost 400 calories during my session and I felt like I was challenging myself. During the workout you are not expected to try and keep up with everyone else, if you can only do one rep of the three exercises then that is ok. I kept up pretty good, and Ashley also had some alternative exercises for me because I could not do the others with my knee. They play upbeat fun music the whole time as well.\n\nIf I was going to join a gym, this is the top runner thus far. One of the main reasons I am not joining at this time though is the cost. You have to purchase a monitor (99 for the wrist one or 69 for a chest one) and it is 99 a month if you plan to do two classes a week. I am still going to keep it in mind though.",

  "text": "Nerds of the internet, you're probably familiar with \"Delete Facebook, lawyer up, hit the gym.\" Now, I banned Facebook from my work, I luckily don't need a lawyer, but I did need to hit the gym to get out of a funk. I've been going to Christian Street for a couple months now, and am a fan. \n\nSure, I'm not there a lot. But it's the first gym I've ever been to where my initial trainer appointment wasn't an upsell of personal training. The people here just want you to be happy and healthy and have fun (especially if you're going to a class).\n\nI haven't been to many classes, but the few I've been to have been great. BodyPump is offered most days of the week for those who sometimes get lazy with their lifting schedule (*cough* me *cough*).\n\nMost of my time there is spent in the weight room, and it's up to par. There's usualy the same trainer there in the morning (Kathy) and she's great about answering questions and generally being awesome. It gets crowded in the afternoon, but nowhere near what I consider \"gym crowded\" i.e. there's no required flow of traffic you have to follow, there are still lap lanes available to share, cardio machines available even if it's not your preferred one ...\n\nSo generally Christian Street is awesome. Plus, what can I say, I get a kick out of supporting community organizations like the Y. I walked back from the gym one Saturday to see a herd of 20+ members planting trees. Awesome.",

  "text": "Not the best AF. Not the worst. Tucked away in an old shopping plaza with shared parking between a Mexican restaurant and an IHOP, this AF has the standard machines most often used by the average gym-goer with just enough space to get in your workout without much bother. On entry (key fob required), there's a vending machine to the right and 5 treadmills, two stationary bikes, one stair master, and 2 or 3 elliptical to the left. The stair master is awkwardly placed right next to a large window which overlooks the outdoor seating area of the Mexican restaurant, and there are no curtains, so take note of that. \n\nAF reminds me of a surprisingly well stocked hotel gym. It has most of what you need. And again, I may even be more positively biased because I have multiple gym memberships through my health insurance, so I can't attest to whether the membership prices are appropriate. My main complaint really is the location. Who really wants to fight through a crowd of people waiting at either ihop or a Mexican restaurant... to work out?\n\nIt seems to be a clean gym. There are three disinfectant bottles and rags to wipe down machines. It's usually staffed with one or two people during the weekdays.  I've never seen more than 10 people at a time, which is great. \n\nStandard machines. Small turf area, but at least it's there. Some machines are a little cramped together, as others have noted.",

Decided to take him to open gym at HFS because he enjoys trying out different equipment.  The experience was excellent.  It was a little hard to find the entrance as there is just a small sign on the door.  Parking was easy on the street on a sunday afternoon.  Facility was very different than my son's regular gym but he really liked it.  Some climbing apparatuses allowed him to practice his flips and landings from a much higher distance.  Staff was very attentive and happy to move mats to make different courses.  As is typical with the parkour community, everyone was super friendly and he found a group to practice with in a matter of minutes.  All in all, it was a great experience for his ability level.  \n\nIn addition, I wanted to note that even though it was open gym, a staff member was introducing newbies to basic moves, etc...  He vetted my son out quickly and allowed him to go on his way but it's great that they take the time to make sure everyone knows how to use the gym safely.",

If there is a free machine they jump on and do it, usually. I find that some instructors are better than others at clearly demo-ing the move. Stephanie the owner is my favorite for this not only because she is super positive and friendly, but she consistently demo's the moves and gives gentle pointers on form and noticing when your knee goes over your ankle in lunges, etc.",

The complex also includes meeting rooms, an indoor and outdoor pool and outdoor water park, skate park, gardens, and walking/jogging trail that winds through the park and around a fishing pond and wetlands. Monon is also close, as evidenced by its name, to the Monon Trail or Greenway, whichever you choose to call it.\n\nThe fees at Monon are reasonable and the facilities clean and functional. Apparently, much thought was given to the esthetic of the building in terms of keeping it as \"green\" as possible. Think bamboo flooring, native landscaping and such. \n\nA family-friendly fitness center/park if ever there was one!\nAlso holds various special events and recreation classes throughout the year.",

  "text": "First, the positive. With few exceptions the instructors (spin, TRX, etc.) are fantastic, and most classes are included in membership fee. Personal trainers are extra, but worth it if you have the money and don't mind pain. And the facility has almost everything you'd need: pool, tennis courts, squash courts, indoor track, basketball courts, weights, machines, hot tub, sauna, steam room, cold plunge, showers, lockers, childcare, etc. Finally, at least for me, it's really close. \n\nThere are increasing number of negatives, however. As almost all other reviews point out, the place is falling apart. The roof above the indoor track leaks so whenever it rains you have to dodge all the buckets that are deployed (and it's freezing in there). Cardio and weight machines are often broken and sometimes have \"being fixed!\" signs attached for months. There are hundreds of more cosmetic issues, too, like ripped carpets, broken mirrors, and strange stains on the walls. These cosmetic issues shouldn't change the quality of your workout but there's something about seeing everything held together by old duct tape that drains my energy level a tad.     \n\nPeople having conversations on cell phones is also an issue, though perhaps that's true at all clubs these days. It just seems that the Healthplex has a high percentage of alpha males who conduct business deals (real estate, stocks) over the phone and who think the rest of the gym would benefit from the hearing the details. They are loud and laugh off staff who try to quiet them. Management seems loathe to intervene out of fear of losing members. I take headphones even though I don't find them comfortable to wear.\n\nIt might not be a problem for everyone, but another negative for me is that Fox News is almost always blasting away in the men's locker room ... just too much yelling for me. Given the conversations I overhear in various parts of the gym, I think majority of members are fans of Fox News so maybe gym is just trying to please the majority (I get that). That explanation would fit with the apparent age demographics (older, male) of the Healthplex, which initially (I think) served as physical therapy offshoot for the attached Springfield Hospital. \n\nLocker room is fine, though some of the showers seem to lack hot water. One perk for the daring is complimentary deodorant in unlabeled spray bottles. Not sure why they even provide it. Perhaps it's a hint. And there's lots of couch space around the television, plus a faux leather recliner. FYI (and TMI), it's not an infrequent site to see a completely naked person on the couch, though presumably he's recently showered. One can hope, at least. I've also seen men asleep on the recliner. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Also, naked guys shaving, resting against sink. In other gyms guys seem to cover themselves in towels. When in Rome, I guess. \n\nBroadly, I get the sense (from looking at faces and hearing snippets of conversations) that employees are deeply unhappy with management and that the facility is always on brink of insolvency. Seems less crowded than in previous years so I'm guessing it's bleeding members to local gyms that are 1/4 the price and have a more upbeat vibe. There's also probably a few deaths every year -- I see some people for years ... and then they just stop coming. I've never seen anyone just keel over, though.\n\nI think the manager is keenly aware of building issues, equipment age, and demography imbalance. He's probably making changes and improvements that members can't see, but one action that's apparent and troubling to me is the use of Twitter and Facebook ads that feature a completely different gym, one that is gleaming and has modern, unbroken equipment. The ads also tend to feature young female models from Shutterstock's \"Sporty Girl\" collection, not actual members of the gym. I mention this because the women in the ads are often shown with midriff-revealing athletic tops ... which are banned at the actual Healthplex. I think the photographs are from a gym in Novi Sad, Serbia, near the Danube. I hope to go there someday.\n\nI'm wondering whether the California holding company that owns the Healthplex is trying to find a buyer and just doesn't want to put any money into a property that is already in debt.",

I joined crunch fitness because of its proximity to my home (1 mile) in Brandon . I'm way more comfortable at Planet Fitness and PF has a lot more treadmills, ellipticals, cycling machines, etc. The only thing I miss about crunch is the Bluetooth connectivity that the treadmills and stair masters have with Apple watches, this eliminates the need to keep your hands on the sensors. Also, I think adding at least 2 more stair machines would be awesome especially since the current COVID-19 guidelines have taken 2 of the 4 stair machines offline. Also, please add a sanitization station on the east wall (locker room side) behind the the line of treadmills. Keep up the great work with the current cleaning regiment. Lastly, is there any future plans of a Planet Fitness in Brandon? The the now closed Youfit by the mall is just sitting empty, that would be an ideal location",

  "text": "Updating this review because I have been at this gym for about six months now and I am still hooked!\n\nFor starters, just six weeks into working out here I had an in-body assessment done to see the progress I made from when I first signed up. When I looked at my results I was a bit shocked--I was 3 lbs heavier than when I first started. But then I looked at the breakdown and realized I had gained 4 lbs of muscle & lost 2.5% body fat! That, my friends, is results if you ask me! \n\nAll of the workouts are very thoughtfully structured and set you up to get stronger while minimizing the risk of injury. I feel like not only am I stronger, healthier, and more energized now than I was when I first started here, I also have more flexibility and experience less soreness/stiffness. (I used to get gnarly shin stiffness when running, and that problem has subsided so much that it is practically nonexistent.)\n\nAside from my stoked-ness (def just made that word up) about my in-body test results and my increase of strength, I am hooked on the culture of this gym. It doesn't matter whose class I go to, I always have a great work out and genuinely have so much fun.  The instructors are awesome, but there is also such a positive, encouraging and welcoming vibe that all the members of this gym have. \n\nFinal thoughts: Clearly, I highly recommend this gym. And more specifically, I highly recommend signing up for their unlimited classes. It is a bit spendy and more than what you would pay for a standard gym pass, but (if you actually go consistently) it is absolutely worth it as it is a wonderful investment in your health and quite frankly, your confidence. These classes give you workouts that are made with a lot of strategy behind them, trainers that will help you get strong and fit in a safe way, and provide a fun/non-intimidating fitness community to be apart of.\n\nFor real, my final thoughts: There is no start up fee, no cancellation fee, no once yearly \"gym upkeep\" fee (rolling my eyes at another gym whose name I shall not mention here). Jack City keeps it simple: once a month a withdraw comes out of your bank account. You can cancel anytime--no questions asked. **Praise hands** for a gym that cuts all that nonsense out, is straightforward, and just gives people what they come to a gym looking for in the first place--a dang good workout.",

  "text": "The Carondelet YMCA, as a whole, is a nice facility. The gym is ok, but small. (Machines are sometimes down and out of commission for weeks). The basketball court is very nice, too. It's the most used area in the entire complex. What I'm partial to is the track that sits above the court on the second floor. Great overview of the lowel level and suits all cardio needs.\n\nThe indoor and outdoor pool settings are great! The kids really enjoy it. Such a great additive for those sweltering, Summer days.\n\nBut the customer service, though?!!!! Oh, no ma'am. The front desk is atrocious, so is the morale. First of all, why are there so many workers stationed at the front desk, yet none of them are barely paying attention. Furthermore, they all act like they have no clue what they're doing?  Listen, I don't understand. \n\nAnother gripe I have is unruly children running around, swinging off gym equipment. I know part of the problem is the parents not stepping in. HOWEVER, there needs to be more workers, in all areas, enforcing rules about those matters. There's about 50-11 workers at the desk, folding towels...how many YMCA workers does it take to fold linen? Management should really check on that. It doesn't look good walking in and people in YMCA staff t-shirts all clustered together, doing nothing. \n\nThe complex gives a safe and fun place for kids to fellowship and to stay out the streets. But in the customer service department, some changes need to happen.",

Overall we really enjoyed it and look forward to coming back! \n\nPlayground/Water activities: 5/5\nService: 5/5\nCleanliness: 5/5\nConcessions: 4/5",

There's pretty good utilization of machines during the evening rush hour, like 4-7, but even at these peak times I can almost always find an open machine of the type I want. Plenty of parking and plenty of machines are this large location.\n\nThe bathroom, locker room, and showers are large, clean, and well maintained.

There is no signage for parking, which isn't helpful as the parking lot and entrance are on the opposite side of the building from the street. The locker rooms were missing hair dryer machines, and we're not clean. The hot water took about 10 mins to come on in the shower. (A lady in the shower next to me said she complained a few days ago as well about the hot water problem.) The gym equipment is fine--but the gym set-up is very crowded for the number of users for this location.",

Here, you'll get your work in and learn valuable skill sets at the same time. Nothing like a peace of mind coupled with physical fitness. \n\nIf I ever have kids, they're doing this. If you have kids, they should do this. If you're reading this review, YOU should do this. It's definitely for everyone. I've partnerd with cats 70+ years old so there really are no excuses. \n\nTriumph has a very welcoming environment and attitude from all instructors. Not to mention a supportive class of students through and through. The things they teach you become like instinct and is sure to stick with you for a long time even after just a few sessions. Of course, the more you practice, the more of a machine you'll become. \n\nThey have self defense, they have weapons training, they have cardio bags, they have yoga, kettlebells, monkey bar gym (conditioning); it's a full-body experience that will no doubt have you leaving with a sense of security and confidence moving forward. You will be worn out after each class but in the best kind of way. \n\nIt's more than just pumping iron, it's mental, it's situational awareness, it's a lifestyle. Did I mention fun? Yeah, it's hella fun. Do it, thank yourself later. \n\nGreat Job, guys (and gals)!",

The facility is spotless and has such a friendly staff. You can tell each kid wants to go here. The owner is very active with his students, and the instructors are kind, fun, encouraging, and excellent at what they do. We like how they allow the kids to help teach the newer kids, so they both gain something. It's nice to see the teamwork. The kids learn about self-discipline, self-respect, respecting others, and confidence to believe in themselves. We can see my daughter growing and her self-esteem building. The skills she is learning in self-defense are priceless and lifelong. She knows friendship, respect, confidence, having an attitude that doesn't give up, and so much more. She is so proud of completing four belts.  The staff has been exceptional during this crazy pandemic. We couldn't have asked for a better program to work with our daughter during these trying times. We feel so blessed to have a place that has a flexible schedule, and that has fantastic instructors. We recommend everyone involving their children in this program and to this location.",

Employees there seem to do a very good job of keeping things clean and so do the people who work out there. For the most part everyone wipes down their machines, benches and equipment after they use it\n- working condition. Everything works there. Equipment and machines are newer and well kept\n- people. The people seem very chill for the most part. I've seen a few people there who definitely like to give the big boy bad boy looks as they're lifting their 2.5lb Dumbbells but that's expected at any gym. The purple must make some people angry\n\n\nCons: \n- some more equipment would be nice. I've been to other Planet Fitness gyms and many have the newest stair steppers, bench press and incline press that are free weights that are not all limited to the smith machines. \n- can get busy.....\n- Dumbbells maxed at 60lbs which I get, don't need to get the 'lunks' rolling in but would like the preacher curl chair and other things available\n\nI would say join. 20.00/month is unbeatable with all they have to offer",

Staff is friendly and helpful. They have lots of classes to attend to learn how things work. I like the 30 minute circuit area which is a thorough workout. This has an upstairs area with a nice aerial view of the gym and feels more secluded and cozy for me. I feel very welcome in this gym.

  "text": "Whether experienced or beginner climber, there's some good and some bad. We have both people, so let's get into it...\n\nThe beginner says the class was very well instructed, felt after it ended that they would be able to climb and belay with confidence. Also, had a groupon for the class plus 2 week trial and rentals for that day for $22, so no complaints there. But the class was delayed because some people showed up much later than the start time, and that's just annoying. They give classes every hour, so I'd rather you piss off the people who aren't punctual than punish the people who are. The other issue is after the class ended, I can count on one hand how many climbs were a low enough grade to complete, so it's somewhat discouraging.\n\nThe experienced one says that this place is only for people who want to boulder. If that's your thing, you'll love it, they have tons of routes at varying difficulty. But if not, don't bother. I've climbed in other east coast gyms and in California, but this gyms rankings are all over the place. There is no more technique needed on a 5-11 compared to a 5-9, just more strength. I guess why use balance and heel hooks when you can do pull-ups all day long...\n\nTakeaway - Go here to boulder, but go elsewhere to belay climb.",

Also, try not to murder the instructors for inflicting such pain, I had those thoughts too.. it's fine.  After that, everything gets better.  I've been to a few different styles of kickboxing classes.  Here, you all have your own bags.  The instructor teaches a new combo and you get to practice for a short duration (3 minutes?) while the instructors help correct your form as you go.  At the end was partner drills, which they said are different every time.  \nIt was an amazing workout! \n\nThe gym itself is pristine and super clean! I loved the instructors (very encouraging and outrageous amounts of high energy) and can tell the members are all like family. People that come regularly reported how important the closeness of members and accountability has been in their success of working towards their fitness goals. \n\nCons: Cost.

  "text": "I'm a former New Orleanian who visits often from Philly. My Philly gym is a member of IHRSA, a national organization of gyms. Supposedly when you visit other cities, if you go to another IHRSA gym, you get a discount. I looked up NOAC and they are listed as a member of IHSRA on their website. I checked them out, as I'm always in favor of frequenting unusual and historic places rather than chains, like Planet Fitness or whatever.  The membership person, a very polite and professional person, took all my info and made a copy of my license. She checked out my IHSRA \"passport\" which verified my membership. She said the charge is $20. That seemed high to me, so I asked if this included the IHSRA discount. She looked puzzled and said she'd have to ask someone. She disappeared for about 5 minutes and came back and apologetically told me that while they are a IHSRA facility, they don't offer a discount.\n\nI explained that there are at least 3 other gyms in the area that are members and who offer 50% discount. From my perspective, there is no advantage to attending NOAC with my IHSRA membership. She wouldn't budge. Since my husband had dropped me off there, I decided to bite the bullet and stay. \n\nIt would seem to me that she could have given me a pass.  Many gyms offer a free one day trial. The gym was NOT busy at all. She gave me one flimsy towel.\n\nI had a good workout. The place is cool. I appreciate the old feel of it, with framed posters of old members and the cool tile floors and old pool. It has a lot of history to it.\n\nThe ladies changing area is nothing great. Pretty tired looking. The shower head was FREAKING awesome, but there were no grab bars or benches to sit on in the shower. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Also, signage is very poor. The place is big and you kind of wander around looking for stuff.\n\nAnd it ain't cheap.  Annual membership for a single person is $250 initiation fee and $88 monthly.\n\nA much better gym is the Jewish Community Center on St. Charles Ave.  This place is a SPA in comparison. You want to spend hours in the ladies lounge. \n\nIf NOAC wants to be competitive, they should not be so stingy. It's not that great a place where they can afford to do that.",

One of the best things about the classes are that they are not just cardio but the machine itself provides resistance and the added intervals of weight training really add a toning element.  Its different from anything else and you really do see a difference in your body and your abilities! \n\nThey offer a variety of classes including a rowcore, bootcamp (cross fit style work out incorporating the erg) and row and flow (rowing and yoga).  There are many different packages you can get, and they all let you experience the different classes. \n\nThe instructors are all friendly, and knowledgeable and take time to teach you how to use the machine.  The classes are all high energy, every class is different from the last and provide amazing work outs.   \n\nThe best part about Row Zone is how much of a community it is, it is like being part of a team.  Everyone who comes is there to work out and push themselves, and a high level of comradery  develops, everyone pushes each other too.  Its makes the classes fun, and fly by.  As an example they recently hosted a \"Manayunk Slide\" with 2,000 meter races on the ergs.  People came to race and stayed to cheer each other on.  The energy there was infections and made me really excited to be a part of it and to push myself further!",

If you don't lose then you don't get your money back... they make you advertise for them, they also make you change your profile picture to their 6 weeks challenge picture.... and also they make you leave good reviews and rate them a 4 or 5 star them... all this so you can get your money back... this place is a waste of time",

  "text": "Having visited the Ardmore and Radnor locations in Phila and the WSC in Columbia Heights DC, I can tell you that paying the monthly fee for the location in Fairmount is a major gyp. \n\nNot only does the Fairmount location lack a basketball court, swimming pool, juicing center and ample parking, it also only provides a half way decent service in the areas it should be strong in.  There are only about 15 treadmills available and there is always 1 or 2 out of service.  There is never soap in a couple of the women's soap dispensers. One of the two paper towel dispensers almost never works.  The showers overflow on a regular basis.  And the parking situation is dismal.  There are only 15 spots to park in or else you can pay $5 for a spot at whole foods per visit.  This is all pretty bad when you're paying for what should be a premium service.  The same $59 per month at another PSC location will provide all the above listed amenities at a top notch facility.  \n\nSo why come here?  If you live in the area then you're paying for the location... \n\nI will say the classes are really great.  They offer Pilates, cardio, spin, inter-mural type classes and the instructors are very good and encouraging and I can definitely feel a difference from that.  \n\nBut as far the facility is concerned, management is only concerned with signing up new contracts so don't expect any of these complaints to turn into realized changes.",

After stopping in to look at the gym while traveling in the area, I was told that there would be a charge for working out each day I was in town. I have no problem paying a fee, as I'm not a member. However, the manner in which I was told this by the front desk was curt and gave off the appearance of \"why are you wasting my time by asking me this?\" - I was then told that I could walk around and see the gym to decide if I wanted to workout, which was nice. After leaving the gym I found a workout pass online, at the company website, that indicated a workout was free. I printed it out and brought it back later and was able to work out. However, when I walked back into the gym the same person I spoke with before refused to help me check in.",

There are more machines to choose from than the Twelve Oaks location, which is great for variety. There is a room with TRX equipment if that is something you're into. There is a large selection for cardio, free weights as well as other machines. I've attended in the mornings, evenings, on weekdays and weekends and it's never too busy to work out. I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a piece of equipment. \n\nThe gym staff is nice and the managers are helpful. One particular employee didn't seem to know the gym as well as he should but it doesn't influence my opinion of this gym or the gym location. \n\nThere are three changing stalls and 4 showers, including a handicap assessable shower and changing stall. There are also plenty of lockers with and without combinations built in. Drinks are also available for purchase if you forget yours. \n\nI was even able to get my mom to buy into the gym, and she hates going to the gym. She was looking for something cheaper than a yoga membership that still provides variety for working out. This gym atmosphere is not like usual gyms. There are all walks of life that attend and it's easy to feel comfortable when working out alone.",

  "text": "One of the worst experiences I have had with a gym. I was told when I first signed up that I would have guest passes so that I would be able to bring my boyfriend. When I did bring him in, he was turned away. They said my membership did not include that and would not even offer a one day guest pass for him. When I first joined, I also did the one complementary hour with a personal trainer. Which I waited for 45 minutes for the trainer to come available, even though I scheduled an appointment a week in advance. While he was trying incredibly too hard to sell me, he told me there was no way I was going to be able to loose weight unless I worked with them. After I declined, every time he would see me in the gym he would continue to try to sell me on working with a trainer and made me pretty uncomfortable. After I had enough with the gym I called their corporate to find out how the cancellation works. Which I was told I my membership would be cancelled that day and I would get a credit for what I paid in advance. When I went in to cancel the girl at the desk pretty much called me a liar and said I was not going to get a credit and that's how it was going to be. After, I called corporate and was made to feel like I was a liar again and was told  that they were not going to do anything. \n\nI will tell every person I come in contact with not to join that gym. Biggest mistake I made.",

  "text": "The Mecca Gym is a gem of a training facility located in a strip mall area right off the freeway in Meridian, ID.  It is tucked back in such a way as to allow for back door access to the back lot for Prowler runs, farmer's walks and tire flipping.  \n\nOwned by local natural bodybuilders and powerlifters, Eric and Kacee Cafferty, the locals all have a sense of ownership and familial bonding after only one visit to this gym.  Go in without your headphones on and you'll see what we mean.  Everyone is friendly, willing to help, coach, co-train and chat about pretty much anything.  We saw a 130# gossipy female (very entertaining) trying to pr her squat with a 210# beefcake mainstay of the club.  \n\nAll of the equipment is top-of-the-line and the Cafferty's own several unique pieces we have not seen anywhere in the Treasure Valley.  These include a Nautilus pec-deck straight from Venice Beach, a Roger's squat (if you haven't worked your ass-quads-core in this remarkable piece of equipment, a visit to The Mecca Gym is worth it just for that.) and a seal row bench.  The powerlifting staples are of the best quality we've seen in the entire state and if you are trying to just work on your Big 3, this is your gym.\n\nCardio equipment consists of a row of treadmills and a step mill.  They also own a Jacob's Ladder, which is great.  The step mill has no platform for a phone or iPad to watch a movie so that's disappointing.\n\nThe staff is all sincerely friendly with welcome greetings, big furry smiles and surprisingly, the females don't annoy us with their friendly chatter.  The \"Mecca Family\" (meaning the members) are always available to help spot you, inform you or give you a tip on how to hit that little-know muscle group or to share a new delicious recipe.\n\nThe reason we gave The Mecca gym only 4 of 5 stars is that it also offers tanning and childcare-neither of which are note-worthy or worth it.  The child care room is always unmanned and you have to ask a staff member to hang out with your kids.  This would be fine for older children, but if you have a little one, training over an hour gets you feeling guilty as there are RARELY any kids to play with here.  They do have a tv and the kids can watch movies or play with the plethora of trucks, baby toys or a toy kitchen.  Also, there is really no set limit on the childcare hours like at other facilities so you could come with the kids at 3 am and train until noon if you so chose.  Also, you could let your kids hang out with you on the floor as long as they are well-behaved.  This is something you really don't see.  The tanning bed was used by us twice in a row and not a drop of color after 15 minutes which tells us that the bulbs must need changing.\n\nAll-in-all, this is decidedly FABULOUS gym and we could train here for hours!",

  "text": "This gym is fine for bouldering but their policy for belaying is inexplicably restrictive. I have climbed frequently at about 4 other climbing gyms in major cities (including San Francisco and Philadelphia) and everywhere I've ever been, a climbing gym will allow paying guests to become trained in belaying, pass a test to prove they can operate the equipment safely, and become certified to belay their friends. At SB Rock Gym, they refused to allow my guests to become trained in belaying. I still don't understand why. Their staff members insisted that there is no place in the country that will allow you to become certified in belaying and immediately climb thereafter, but that statement is belied by my own experience at Mission Cliffs (SF), Planet Granite (SF) and Go Vertical (Philly) and a few other places. \n\nThey also inexplicably refused to allow me to bring in my own Vibram 5-finger shoes (which I have used for climbing for the last 5 years at least, without any problem), and made me rent their shoes for $6. It was a real pain and they gave no good reason why I couldn't climb in my own shoes that I prefer for climbing. \n\nTheir bouldering wall is fine but if you're looking to come here with friends to climb and belay, and you're not already certified here, then I don't recommend this place.",

  "text": "This was the first city I've tried Barry's bootcamp in (so no other cities to compare it to). I have attended several HIIT gyms previously, all were similar. You split your hour between the treadmill and the floor (weights, bands).\n\nI really enjoyed the trainers (all very nice), and the workout routines on the floor. Each day focuses on a different area- upper body, lower body, total body, etc. You can put in as little or as much effort as you want- you WILL be sore the following day! There is ONE spot for \"double floor\" (DF) routine, if you need a break from the treadmill. \n\nThis leads me to the only true negative I have- it is close to impossible to get the DF spot. You are able to book classes up to a week in advance, but people seem to just WAIT for the DF spot to open and reserve it immediately. Would definitely suggest adding more DF spots. \n\nOnly other negative is that if you cancel within 24 hours of class, you are charged $10. I understand how other gyms do it- they charge you if you cancel within ONE hour of your reserved class, but 24 hours seems a bit extreme (especially since all of us have unforeseen circumstances, particularly with work). \n\nOther than that, I really enjoyed the time I spent going to the gym. It was easy to get to (and parking in the garage next door is free), clean, and had plenty of equipment. I would definitely return if more DF spots opened up!!",

While I always thought of the term Functional Fitness as being just another gimmick to sell fitness videos, the equipment that was brought in is very useful in completing a whole body workout. The TRX stations and sled are a much needed addition to any gym. Also two power racks with deadlift stations were included in this most recent remodel with rubberized weights much needed when deadlifting. \n\nAND they kept the good old equipment, like the hammer chest and back machines.  Well done. Plenty of dumbell weights are still available. I understand the two old squat racks will be returned to service soon as well. \n\nIf you are looking for a decent workout, and not training for a specialized sport ( CrossFit, powerlifting, Olympic lifting) I recommend this gym.",

  "text": "I decided to use this gym while I was in NJ for a few weeks. \n\nFirst impression: \nThe facility's aesthetics was a definite pleaser. The newness of this facility makes it that much more of an encouragement to use the gym. However it is no Equinox!!\n\nPros: \nFirst, the treadmill seemed above par in technology - your stats are all in a digital LCD screen. In addition, the treadmill has a TV (which is pretty standard in most gyms now), but doesn't have a built in fan (a bummer if you are use to that amenity). There are plenty of cardio equipments (i.e. treadmills, ellipticals, cycling, stepper). I've never had an issue finding a treadmill. Second, there is a track that goes around the gym. This is great for people who actually want to run or walk outside of the treadmill. Third, I appreciate that they utilize disinfectant wipes for cleaning equipment. My gym in Chicago uses a spray with paper towels throughout the facility. I suppose it's less wasteful. Fourth, the locker room is really fancy. It looks like teak wood and the lockers are all digitally locked (no need to bring your own master lock!). They have nice towels, a separate restrooms and a shower room. Fifth, there is an amazing pool room. I believe one is for kids, one is for recreational use, and another is for distance swimming. Lastly, for the most part the trainers have been nice.  \n\nCons: \nThe downsides to the gym became apparent to me after first use. First, I use the TRX suspensions in my gym in Chicago which is open to EVERYONE. Apparently in Virtua's Wellness Center, only clients are allowed to use this secretive room. Fortunately, I've been able to use the TRX when I asked some trainers, while others including some blonde female was really rude about how it was only for clients. I don't really appreciate this exclusive attitude towards certain equipment. That dismissive, non-inclusive attitude is a reason why some people avoid the gym. \n\nI wish there was more room and mirrors. Since the TRX room is only for clients, I was unsure If I was even allowed to use the studio to do Pilates or use jump ropes. They have a little room in the carpeted area between the studio and the cardio equipments. It's really weird to do some workouts without a mirror. I kind of wish they had mirrors in that wall so I can see if I am doing my movements right. I am use to my gym in Chicago with mirrors everywhere, even in the pillars. \n\nI would recommend the gym to put a monthly calendar of classes that are used in those specific studio spaces. It would make it easier for those of us who just want to use the space for simple exercises and stretches and know when we have to leave before a class starts. \n\nThat prone curl/hamstring machine... I have only ever seen one person use it. I have used a completely different one in my gym in Chicago. This machine has you lay on your stomach long. If you are short like me, there is no way you can hold on to those handles and have your legs curl with your legs spread out the way the machine has it laid out. I've had to use the cable cross to work on my hamstrings instead :( Also, no stair master! What is this...\n\nOn a few occasions, I've had people come up to me whenever I was doing Pilates. I looked at the biographies of the trainers at this facility and it seemed generic (no offense). No one had expertise in Pilates or yoga. I am not a fitness guru, but I have my share of experience. I think this facility would be surprised to see the interest in different programs like Pilates, yoga, barre, and TRX. I don't know if it's just a south jersey thing, or they are just really bad at advertising.\n\nAlthough I have some detailed cons, I cannot help but like this facility. It really is a clean facility. Everyone seems to know each other and are generally polite. Considering this is a new facility, it still has room for improvement to give it that competitive advantage to Retro Fitness or LA Fitness.",

I spoke with a very arrogant personal trainer by the name of Paul he looked annoyed as I was asking questions.  I told him I spoke to someone a few months ago about joining the gym . At that time they told me it would be 60.00 a month . Paul however, told me it was basied on a point system and any questions to ask mangement . Wow no happiness in his voice just pure rudeness. He then explained how the do the analysis testing and pulled up his own profile . I explained to Paul that I have recently had to go in a have several biopsies done for Cervical Cancer and if I join would they customize a fitness plan for me ? He then quoted Cancer is caused by one eating too much sugar that stays in the stomach area causing inflammation to the designed area . I was shocked actually asshole Paul Cancer is caused by me having family members who have all died from it and it was passed down to me . Educate yourself please before you speak . Needless to say after that conversation I went home and joined Chooze on Grant and Swan for they certainly did not judge me because I am a survivor of Cervical Cancer.",

  "text": "Over the years, I have had many friends invite me to join them for a cycling class, but my response was always \"No, thank you. Spinning is the one exercise that I just can't do!\" Most recently, my daughter started going and after renewing her 2nd package of classes with SoHo, her excitement and enjoyment of the classes piqued my interest, so she booked us bikes for a morning class with Stephen. I was both intrigued and intimidated but willing to give it a whirl.\n\nReservations aside, we wandered into the studio at the ungodly hour of 5:45 in the morning, ready.\n\nWe were warmly greeted at the front desk and enthusiastically checked in, given shoes and resistance bands and I followed my girl to the lockers and then into the studio. The room was dark, and the music was already pumping. Stephen recognized a \"newbie\" and asked if I needed help (I DID!). He adjusted my bike and helped me get clipped in.\nI sat there a moment and my daughter told me to start pedaling. I told her I thought it best to conserve my energy, but she insisted that I had to warm up. After a few moments, the class began, and I was transported to a completely different world.  The 3 huge video screens kept me in a zone, music pumped through my veins, and my legs hypnotically cycled to the beat. \n\nI kept up as best as I could and Stephen's welcome words of \"this is a judgement free zone!\" kept going through my head. My self-doubts were gloriously silenced. There in the studio, it didn't matter how early in the morning it was, what the people around me were wearing or if I felt better on the saddle while everyone else was running. It was all good!\n\nBefore I knew it, the 45 minutes were over, and we had rocked through an entire session filled with speed, hills and strength. As we cooled down and stretched out, I felt like I was on top of the world -- and it still wasn't even light outside yet. \n\nI now understand the power behind SoHo's loyal following. Stephen, Cisco, Michelle, and the rest of the SoHo Cycling team, thank you!!! for providing an amazing ride! I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.",

A high intensity course? check.  At your own pace walking?  got it.  The Y offers a place where you can find something that's right for you! \n- Fun classes- I'm a sucker for classes and I love the variety of encouraging teachers!\n\nWhat I'm a little sad about: \n- It feels the Y hasn't accommodated for the influx of guests and members with the new year/ opening.  Those bringing guests have to wait in line for longer than 15 minutes at a time for their guest pass on a weekday morning.  I'm hoping they add more staff to streamline the process soon!  It's a bummer that this is many people's first impression.  \n- The two lane walking track is a bit smushed.. \n\nOverall, super pumped to pump some iron at Cityway (okay.. let's be real, I'm more of a yoga, zumba, kick-boxing girl).",

They were totally on top of giving equipment instructions, safety and keeping lines in order.  I was impressed.  \n\nThey also were mindful of the party's timeframe and well organized.  \n\nMy guys are teetering on being \"too old\" (12 1/2 & pushing 14!)  for this great facility but had fun anyway.\n\nI'd highly reccommend 'Gynnastics & Cheerleading Academy' for kids from ages 5 - 11.

There is an onsite concession stand available which offers drinks and various snack items for visitors to enjoy. There are plenty of trampoline areas to enjoy ranging from basketball, dodgeball, open jump arena, jump pit and more along with laser tag which is included with your wristband purchase. \n\nCons:\nCouple of things regarding our first visit here would mainly be about the air quality (smell) within this facility which smelled like a sweaty locker room with absolutely no ventilation. I would certainly hate to be in there during the summer months when tempuratures are nice and warm. They do have fans but they really don't help. Needless to say, stepping outside for a breath of fresh air was a real treat. Parking can be a bit challenging during the early evening hours but there is additional parking in the street. \n\nSuggestions:\nConsider the idea of having better airflow quality within your facility so that it doesn't smell like gym socks and especially for individuals with asthma that are sensitive to poor air quality (because of this, not sure that we will be returning) Not everyone has Facebook; consider opening a Twitter account to broadcast your specials and other announcements which help drive more revenue by extending your customer base via social media.",

I like Retro Fitness because all of their gyms use Life Fitness equipment, which are top of the line machines and very expensive. I also like their cardio theater A LOT. Not many gyms have this feature, this, I've come to realize. For $20 a month, this is truly the best value you can get out of a gym membership. \n\nWhen I see or hear people complain about Retro, it bothers me, because honestly, what were you expecting? Maybe it doesn't have a lot of classes or the child care is not that great, but for $20/month, great machines, a cardio theater, some classes, sounds like a great deal to me. I rather go to Retro Fitness than pay an extra $15/month at LA Fitness for a swimming pool and a few more classes. \n\nFinally, I've never had a problem with membership fees, or cancelling it when I moved. I've read some horror stories of how some people being hit with fees when trying to cancel their membership, but this has never happened to me.\n\nI miss Retro :'(",

They all treated me as if I was a new member of their studio, not just a visitor. They all seemed genuinely happy to have me there and were all very welcoming. When I said goodbye on my last morning, they said \"OH NO ITS YOUR LAST DAY?!\" which I thought was cute. Thanks for making me feel at home, guys!\n\nThe studio itself is one of the largest I've been to. I loved how the rowers were in the middle of the room- it makes mobility much easier. \n\nI took Mikaela's classes and she played incredible music, was friendly and energetic. She made waking up at 4:30am while on business actually something to look forward to.\n\nMy only gripe with this studio is their sound system sucks. It's really muffled and hard to understand what the coaches are saying. But other than that, you can NOT go wrong here.

It's honestly one of the greatest and most rewarding decisions I've made in my life - not only are my workouts inside the gym way more intense than anything I've done but my health outside the gym improved drastically to be able to go back everyday and train more. Even if you're not looking for it you truely start to adopt a new healthier lifestyle with martial arts.\nNJMA is a great place for anyone to come in and learn how to defend themselves on the street or for a jiujitsu/MMA competitor looking to take their game to the next level. Not only are the students at the school world class but the coaching you recieve from Marco is by far the best in South Jersey. This should definitely be one of your first stops when shopping around for a jiujitsu or mixed martial arts school.",

  "text": "These people are THIEVES! I moved from Miami to Harbour Island and toured the facility with a representative named, Sue. I mentioned that everything looked quite outdated and old, she PROMISED they were starting a massive remodel that very next week in the Mens Locker Room with brand new steam rooms and saunas. Reluctantly, I signed on. On my first visit, the group fitness studio had no air conditioning and the mens locker room was filled with bandaids in the lockers, hair balls and cracked tiles in the steam room, moldy shower curtains and dust filled air vents.\n\nI emailed Sue and requested my membership cancellation considering the club was not how she described nor were the renovations actually underway (or actually happening). They charged me 3 months minimum to cancel my membership and then charged me a 4th. month on top of that! I drove the club to speak with the General Manager, Scott who refused to see me because he was \"in a meeting\" even though I said I would wait. Sue was no help and literally put me on the phone in her office with a corporate representative and she walked out. I have now been charged over $700 for stepping foot in that place TWICE!\n\nThey are liars, deceivers, thieves and manage a glorified YMCA. The club's conditions are horrible, it's dirty, unkept and outdated. STAY AWAY - You are way better off hiring a personal trainer to come to your house for the amount of money they will scam you from and the condescending treatment they will give you.",

I went to Amped last week to take a look at the facility and decide if I want to switch. I got there just before 10 p.m. and was refused the standard service of getting a tour. Apparently I was there after hours. But people were working out and 4 staff members were there. Four of them. One refused to help me, the other 3 just sat there, redefining uselessness. The one who refused to help me then said he had been there since 8:00 in the morning. As if I'm supposed to care. All I wanted to do is look at the equipment for less than 5 minutes. He asked me if I could come back another day. Genius, do you really think I will ever go back after you and your incompetent coworkers made me feel like I'm not welcome? Is my money not good enough for Amped? I'm sticking with the gym I belong to. By the way, Amped, I've seen the staff at my gym give tours to potential members after midnight. Your staff should all be fired. They are an embarrassment to your company. This gym is a disgrace.",

He did not seem very intelligent as he was not able to answer even the simplest of questions.\n\n The workout rooms wgere the hold classes run to extremes, when it's freezing out they are freezing when it's hot out they are extremely hot and humid.  A woman once almost passed out and actually had to stop class and we had to actually get her water and a cold compress.\n\nAdditionally when you're in the sauna the cleaning crew comes in and they start spraying chemicals to clean the inside of the sauna which is extremely unhealthy.\n\nFor a  chain as large is this they should get their act together or sell the business to someone actually who cares about their clients.\n\nNeedless to say in all good consciousness I cannot recommend this gym to anybody who cares about their health.\n\nAs far as hiring a trainer their  I wouldn't bother unless you get Gwendolyn she seem to be the only one who shows you the correct way of doing things and that actually cares if you succeed.  Other than that it seems like you'd be wasting your money.\n\nDorota absolutely the worst yoga instructor ever.   Does not know difference between left and right, asked you to do things that are anatomically impossible.   Does not even know the name of simple basic poses, takes breaks and gives multiple breaks in a 45 minute class.  They must be hard up in getting qualified instructors.

My wife and I took the introductory safety course which was $50 for the two of us and included instruction and all the gear we needed, as well as a two week membership.  Gear rental is very reasonably priced (about $20 for two people each visit), but it looks like if you plan on visiting more than a few times you should go ahead and buy the equipment.  They had a reasonable beginner's package that was very tempting.\n\nEven though you can see that the staff have to give these courses out several times a day, they managed to stay very enthusiastic while presenting instructions and would even wander around yelling encouragement to us after we were left to our own devices.  The whole process from walking in to climbing walls was quick and enjoyable.  \n\nYou will definitely need a partner to get the most of our your experience here if you're a first time climber, and you can only expect about an hour or two unless you do a lot of forearm work already.  Your spirit will be willing, but your fingers will fail you!  And if you're a weenie like me, you can expect some odd arm cramps the next day when you try to pick up something.  But despite all my whining, I had a great time and will be going back within my two week membership period, fingers allowing!",

  "text": "As I'm a cheap sadist who enjoys working out within an inch of my life I was attracted to Fit Body Boot Camp's Groupon deal of 3 weeks unlimited workouts and nutritional counseling. I had been doing High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) at home, but lacked the large ropes, jump boxes, TRX straps, full weight and kettlebell sets, and a trainer yelling, \"C'mon, get those legs moving, don't slow down!\" to counteract the screaming voices of despair in my head.\n\nMy boot camp experience began with an orientation with Rocio, who showed me the facility and made me sign the usual waiver. As this place just opened up not too long ago, the space was clean and the equipment in good shape. Rocio even mentioned that we should wear only clean, non-street shoes while working out, to keep the mats clean. A container of wipes was available to achieve this purpose. My orientation was over in less than 5 minutes, as it was established that I was active, had done HIIT previously, and had no idea what the true meaning of \"pain\" was.\n\nI returned a few days later for a noon boot camp session with Joe. There were only a handful of other unknowing hopefuls.  Each 30-minute workout starts with some warm up, consisting of jogging, arm circles, etc., while the trainer takes us through the 5 or 6 stations. Each station is 30 seconds of 2 exercises done 3 times through, without a break. The exercises usually comprise of something on the TRX pulleys, the ropes, floor exercises with weights or slides, ending with some abs/plank work on the floor.  We have only 5 seconds to transition between each station, not including the time we are on the ground, writhing in pain. \n\nThe exercises change daily and are designed by a sadist (aka. Fit Body Boot Camp franchise), which takes no care in arranging the exercises.  I've had circuits which went from ropes to push ups to renegade rows or arm work without little rest in between.  \n\nTrainers give variations on some moves, to increase or decrease level of difficulty, or for those with certain issues (ie. Sense of impending death). The sessions are thankfully quite short- 30 minutes - so instead of the experience feeling a slow, painful death, it's more akin to someone hitting you hard on the head with a 2 by 4 then telling you to get up, because the class is over, when you're trying to figure out which way is \"up\".\n\nI've had Joe and Rich and both are knowledgeable and have their own teaching style. As I go to Joe's noon classes, which are less full than the usual peak times - the vibe is more subdued, and the classes smaller. (By subdued, I don't mean that Joe will let you get away with doing a half-assed job.) Rich teaches the larger, after-work crowd and does a great job of learning everyone's names, motivating the masses, giving everyone a high-five when the workout's through, \n\nThere's also a sense of camaraderie among the regular participants, who are thankfully very normally-attired, average-bodied people. I'm not sure who the chiseled, spandexed, sports-bra'd smiling, happy people people in the video ads on the Fit Body website are, but I've not yet encountered one in class. I think if you're smiling through this workout, you are obviously not doing it correctly, or have so far surpassed your pain threshold that you have truly lost your mind.\n\nThe only reason why this isn't a five-star review is the rather confusing and misleading pricing plan. I got the 3-week Groupon via Groupon for $39.99, but if you purchase the Groupon directly through the company's website, the cost is only $29.00 for the same 3 weeks. But wait! There's a 21 day boot camp experience for only $21.00 and then the 21-day fat loss at $67.00. There is no explanation of what each plan is on the website. But as I got more than 3 weeks through my initial Groupon, I'm OK with the higher price I had initially paid. And $21.00 for 21 days can't be beat.",

  "text": "I have no chill - I'm fully obsessed with Shred. \n\nFor me, the keys to a good workout are a killer playlist, a high energy, motivational instructor, and a workout that doesn't get boring. Shred classes check all the boxes! \n\nThe studio asks you to arrive early for your first class, so they can have you sign your waiver and then give you a tour of the studio. The studio space is so nice, and the bathrooms have showers (!!!), plus all the things you forget when you inevitably need to rush from workout to another thing (hair ties, brush, hair spray, deodorant, blow dryer, ALL THE THINGS.) When you enter the class space for your first class, your instructor tells you more about what to expect and shows you around your deck (which I found to be extra helpful because I've never really lifted and had no idea what I was doing on that front!). \n\nTypically classes are four 15 minute intervals, two on the deck (floor with weights) and two on the treadmill. Some instructors change it up and do different intervals, but they cue very clearly to let you know when there's a change coming up. \n\nThis workout can be totally customized to the fitness level that works for you - as examples, the instructors tell you to grab a light weight, or to raise your treadmill speed .1-.5 - so you're in control of your workout. I appreciate that if I'm having a rough day (or rough interval), I can take it down a notch, but when I'm feeling great, I can make it more challenging. \n\nThe instructors are SO, SO good. Like truly, I can't say enough great things about the instructors. They cue well (which trust me, now speaking as an instructor, it's harder than it sounds!), and they're great about keeping things moving during class. The entire staff is so friendly, and they make it a really welcoming environment. \n\nOh also - I'm a sucker for merch, and they have cute stuff!",

This location offers group fitness classes, tanning, and hydro-massage. You get free 2 hour parking in the West parking garage, even though it's a bit of a pain to get in and out of.\n\nPros: \n-Updated Bathrooms with brand new Sauna.\n-Cheap membership, starting at $9.95/month + annual fee.\n-Friendly staff.\n-Lots of weight/cardio equipment.\n-Large group fitness room.\n\nCons:\n-Santa Monica stairs: this location has these giant Santa Monica stairs which seem really cool, but no one uses them and they take up valuable space.\n-Location of the bathrooms: you have to walk in between everyone squatting and lifting weights to get to the bathrooms/locker rooms. Sometimes I feel like I'm stepping over people.\n-The equipment is so cramped, you can barely get by some of the machines because they're that close.\n-They got rid of the wipes and only offer paper towels and bathroom cleaning spray to wipe down machines. Which is fine, but they're not conveniently located to the machines and usually either the paper towels or cleaning spray is empty so I know most people are not wiping down equipment. Yuck.",

Ive tried on numerous occasions to ask/get some help about membership for a friend and none would spare the time to talk to me at all.  Horrible customer service I think.\n\nThe pool and jacuzzi will leave you with a film of disgusting slime on you, I think because they do not clean the pool it builds up with the human body oils and filth washed off in there (mostly because people do not shower before entering the pool right after they come from the gym all sweaty and dirty).\n\nProbably 2 people in the entire gym use a sweat towel when they work out (I would be one of those 2) which I don't think I should have to say, but it is so disgusting.  Signs all over telling everyone to use a towel but no one does...  Just work out then leave all your sweat, body odor, hair and filth stuck to all the equipment when your done, I bet if a health inspector went in tomorrow he would have a cow at all the bacteria on the benches, seats, handles, and weights.  And if to make matters worse, NONE of the gym staff use a towel when they work out either!  The first time I have ever seen such a badly run gym in my life!\n\nThey have one 1 custodian working there usually, and all he does is vacuum the rubber floors...  Never seen him, not once, wipe equipment down or even just spray them with alcohol or cleaner or anything!  Absolutely ridiculous.  I have been in the gym at hours from morning to night and have only ever seen 1 guy working there and all they do is vacuum...\n\nThe only saving grace would be the variety of equipment they own and maybe a class or two held there, other than that this place is a bacterial nightmare run by unprofessional slobs.  I feel it would be my duty to call the health inspector after seeing all that goes on in here, I'm sure there have been reports of infections and fungus being contracted here.",

Now for my dislikes: The cardio equipment is horrible, very cheap bottom line stuff, it is also broken most of the time. Next are the 15-20 buckets sprawled out all over the gym floor used for catching drips falling from the leaking roof. No one wants to see buckets full of nasty water, or get dripped on when they are working out. The workout equipment is in great disarray as well, many of it broken for months at a time. People spend hundreds of dollars a year to use this gym and they can't fix their roof or equipment. Where does all the gym membership fees go? Clearly not back into the gym.

More if you go to other colleges. I transferred to Temple but lived near 12th street so they hiked up the aforementioned college discount, but I still went through with it because it was such a great gym.\n+ Great variety of classes ranging from cardio striptease to salsa dancing to boot camp at 6 in the AM, etc. My ass was usually first falling asleep at 6 AM so I never made it to that. There was one called Urban Corps that looked pretty fierce. \n+Really clean\n+Very gay friendly environment, which should go without saying. Very friendly environment in general with an emphasis on students and younger professionals in the area, but don't worry about feeling self-conscious. People are welcoming, cool and keep to themselves.\n+There are trainers but they're not up your ass\n+Nice assortment of equipment and weights, including a Cardio Theatre where you can plug in music/watch tv and work out.\n+Stays open fairly late Monday thru Thursday, and is open at 5 or 6 in the AM.\n\nCons.\n-Like most gyms, gets incredibly crowded between 5 and 8 most week nigts, maybe even earlier.This is to be expected and I've never been a member of a gym where there was no rush hour, it just feels a little overcrowded this time of night. Good luck trying to get a treadmill or elliptical during this time. You might want to sign up.\n-Would be cool if they extended their hours Fridays through Sundays\n-Get ready for a lot of Deborah Cox remixes. And the Dreamgirls soundtrack, remixed. This isn't a complete negative, because I really was getting into it the first couple of times. But I'm almost positive the music played at nearby Pure is funneled in through the 12th Street soundsystem.\n\nThat being said, great place!",

This is a fantastic value for the price, Fantastic!\n\nWhile they don't have the best and latest equipment, they have all the essentials. Really the only thing I would want from them is a free bar for swats and dead lifts (they only have the Smith Machine). \n\nBut for $10 a month you get 24 hour access and free Pizza the first Monday of the month. That's an unbeatable proposition. Haha I was even showering here daily when my bathroom was being renovated. If your homeless or on the verge of homelessness, this is the last expense to cut!\n\nMy only real complaint is that they have FOX news as one of there channels on there T.Vs for people doing cardio. Don't they realize that the average age of the Fox news audience is 66? Change the channel!",

I tend to back away from taking care of myself. I keep coming back to OT, however, when I need a fun, challenging, and effective workout to make me feel refreshed and motivated. \nEach class offers an amazing balance of cardio and strength training via the treadmill, the rower, free weights, and TRX bands. Just show up, and a professional trainer will guide you through a powerful hour of fitness! \nBonus: Accurately track your progress through the heart rate monitor strapped to your chest or arm during class... you will be able to view the results in real time on the screens in the gym, as well as via an email summary that's delivered to your inbox after you leave. \nI just signed up for a monthly package that includes 2 sessions a week... make sure you sign up with a fitness buddy so they can help hold you accountable!",

I got the day pass - which BTW is 24 hrs so because I went at 2pm my first day, I was able to come back the next morning for free! Never seen that before but $20 for two sessions? Hell yes!\n\nAnyway, a bodybuilders gym for sure! If you're intimidated by heavy lifters and/or lots of women in scantily workout outfits, maybe not for you but I'm down with it. LOTS of equipment variety and availability. I went midday and it was spacious. I went Saturday morning at 8am and by the time I left after 9am it was pretty busy. I think you would def want to avoid \"peak\" hours.\n\nBut there's some really cool machines! Unique things, I'll post pics of what I tried the second day.\n\nThey've also got supplements for sale at cheaper than online so I snagged some RAW Nutrition. Stoked not to pay shipping and save 5 bucks.\n\nWould love to be a member but just visiting!",

  "text": "I've now been a member for three months and updating  my review. This is still the best gym I've been a member of--and I've been a member of most in the area. But there are items that need to be addressed.\n\nAt busy times, forget about getting a weight machine. It's amazing how many men will work on the machine for 30 seconds or so, then take a three minute break and play on their phones--while staying on the machine. I don't know what can be done about that, but stay away from the gym in the afternoon/early evening if you don't want that experience.\n\nCome to think of it, this may not be a \"men\" problem, but a millennial problem. Too many young people on their phones all the time holding up the machines. It does tend to lean more toward the \"male\" side though, probably because they more often use the machines.\n\nMany lockers in the ladies locker room aren't working. I don't know if they're being reported to the staff, but one day I went through four lockers in a row and the lock just spins. I'd think it's an issue with the manufacturer for sure.\n\nThey are trying to address the difficulty with getting in their very popular classes, but I believe they've gone about it in the wrong way. It used to be you could register 25 hours in advance of a class. Some really popular classes would be full within 20 minutes of registration opening. But when class starts (25 hours later), no-shows and late cancellations meant you didn't get in and the registrant didn't show up. Very annoying. \n\nStarting May, there is a no-show / late cancellation policy that will result in your losing registration privileges for a while. I'm good with that.\n\nWhat I'm not good with is now you can register 48 hours in advance for a class. This allows the \"speculators\" to suck up the spots not being sure they can even make the darned class. I know this because two hours before class starts, sure enough there are tons of cancellations. Problem is by that time, many people are waiting for these spots. If you're not on the waitlist, you have to keep checking the myiclubonline site or your app. \n\nA better way I think would've been to CUT the time you can register to 12 hours or less. By that time, people usually know if they'll be working late, out of town, kids sick, etc. Giving people MORE time to speculate was not a good idea. Giving them less time so it's closer to the class start means more people know for sure whether or not they can make it or \"feel\" like going. \n\nTo make my point, on Friday morning at 8:30 a.m., as soon as the 48 hour window opened to register for the Sunday 8:30 a.m. Body Pump class, in less than a minute, 23 of the 44 spots were taken.\n\nI cannot stress how crowded this gym is after a normal work day. It's like ants crawling around a picnic. Also, the classes are extremely crowded. People don't like waiting to put their class equipment away, so they're walking through classes and it borders on dangerous. I won't even take the spots near the weights or step equipment storage because people walk close to your mat and actually get in your way.\n\nThere are kinks to work out and I'm confident The Edge will do just that. It's a great gym, a very reasonable cost, and for the most part clean. I hope they can sort out the machine hogs, the overcrowded classes and the class registration process (which they are attempting to do).",

I'm so glad I decided to try this facility over any other because this YMCA really is first-rate! Everything was literally spot on. Some of the great things I tried out included:\n\n-Fitness Classes: They feature Les Mills group exercise classes and have some really friendly and fun instructors\n-Fitness Equipment: I checked out some of the cardio and nautilus equipment. All the machines were new looking and clean\n-Pool: What a nice, huge, and well maintained pool. \n-Lobby: Free coffee for members. How great is that?!?!! Love it.\n\nSince this Y is so huge, I wasn't really able to try out everything, but there really are tons of other amenities.\n\nAs I finish this review, I'd like to send a final shout out to the staff. They were all super knowledgeable and amazing!",

  "text": "Review in one word: Underwhelmed.\n\nFor the super-premium monthly rates you get decidedly less than a super-premium selection of free weights and resistance machines, and a very, very sub-par selection of cardio equipment. \n\nThe few classes that I tried were OK, meaning average at best.  You'll get a better spin/cardio experience at Soul Cycle a block away.  My neighbor says the yoga classes are ok but nothing special.  \n\nCredit is due to the overall training of the staff, from those manning the welcome desks, the sales offices, to the trainers and managers roaming the facility and the gym/fitness center floor.  Note that the male managers are always dressed in a suit and tie, or a slim fitting dress (women).  If you ask someone, anyone, 'do you have such and such a free weight/weight machine...?' the standard response is  'have you talked to one of our personal trainers, ... to figure out how to ... accomplish what you want?'\n\nAfter following through with the 'talk to a trainer' response once or twice, no, I don't want to talk to a trainer, which is always a means to lead in to signing up for the personal training services.  I just want to go in and exercise without having to pay someone to watch over me and give me a 'personalized' workout program.  And to suggest I use Lifetime's vitamin supplements or energy gels.\n\nI half suspect Lifetime purposely has a funky selection of fitness equipment in order to steer you to use a personal trainer and the resulting additional fees associated with same.  I've heard others say this and I tend to believe it.\n\nOn a positive note, it's a new and a nice physical facility (you walk in and think I used to go down these stairs to buy socks, underwear and dress shirts when Macy's had a sale). Yes the locker room and shower facilities are nice and new.  And there is the factor of being the newest, loudest, and most promoted fitness center in the immediate area - \"Yea, I joined Lifetime, ...\" this is known locally as cocktail party/happy hour bragging rights when trying to impress others.\n\nI tried other Lifetime facilities in NJ and NY, and they're no different. In fact for a lesser monthly rate you could get a bigger facility and with more offerings, an outdoor pool, squash courts, etc.",

I didn't want to join a gym right away down here with the nice weather approaching so when I heard about this place I thought it would be perfect.\nThe room is very small for the amount of bikes, so you are kind of on top of each other, which kind of grosses me out when everyone is sweating profusely and breathing heavily.  The bikes are also very different than any other spin bike I've ever seen.  This isn't a bad thing.  I do like the power meter on there, because usually I'm just guessing at my speed and resistance level.  \nThe online reservation system is nice too, but I've had a hard time getting a spot in a lot of the classes even signing up a week in advance.  I guess that's a testament to how well this place is doing, but its a little frustrating.  \nAll in all, I think its a great class, just wish the studio was bigger and there were more classes available.",

There's a private lot for gym members, but there's almost always street parking too. \n\nHell, I have a gym in my apartment complex, but I got a membership here for the classes.  Unlimited use of the gym and unlimited classes for $27/mo including taxes.  They give you several options for your membership, but it's only $60 to cancel your membership, which I think is a great deal, so you might as well get the two year contract (depending on your circumstances, of course).\n\nThe only qualm I have is I wish they had more classes!",

Free weights, Smith Machine, pull ups and pull downs. That's it. The staff is mainly kids and people who haven't the slightest idea about fitness. They're just there for the check. So don't expect much. They don't smile, they don't even greet you, too busy playing on their electronic devices. So that's Planet fitness. A big ass building with some equipment that may or may not get you fit. If you're knowledgeable about your fitness level and what you should be doing, you MIGHT be successful. If not and you need guidance, pay $20 more and go somewhere else where the employees are professionals and actually know what they're talking about.",

This club is huge, featuring a dizzying array of cardio equipment, two weight rooms (one I have never entered), indoor track, racquetball courts, indoor and outdoor pools, and more (lots of available services to choose from, such as personal trainers and nutritionists). There is a wide variety of classes (four studios worth!), including yoga classes Monday-Friday evenings.\n\nIt is more than just a health club- this club features computers with internet access, televisions, a Café, and outdoor snack bar. It costs slightly more to be a member of this gym as your primary location, and requires spending $10 monthly at the Café or snack bar. \n\nI prefer the weight machines at this gym (in comparison to the other Elmwood gyms). I typically use the weight room or the elliptical machines.\n\nIf you are primarily a member of Elmwood at Heritage Plaza or Downtown, you can use the Harahan club on the weekends.

The only, negative issue was that we had to call between 2 and 4, the day before surgery for a surgery time confirmation. Who would have thought they would change the time but they did. The new time just did not work and our surgery coordinate switched us to a time that did work after I talked to her. \n\nWe had a stellar experience here. We checked in early, the Nurse came out to talk to us, and explained how to get to nuclear medicine. We took a short trip to the cafeteria and arrived at nuclear medicine early. \n\nWe were taken in and processed. We arrived back to the surgical area early and were again taken in and processed. Alot of people come \"at you\" at once. They ask alot of questions, some repetitive but there's a need for that and they each seemed to genuinely pay attention. \n\nAll in all, a very, very positive experience. Banner - what a turn around.

Trust me, as a trainer I am on the butts of maintenance to get things fixed asap. There are over 3,000 people that go in and out of that single location daily, not including employees and kids in the \"Kidz Klub\".\n\nAs far as the training staff, they do hire \"new\" people, and unfortunately they may be inexperienced, however you can request a more \"seasoned\" trainer when you sign up. Every trainer, before being hired at La Fitness is interviewed, tested and must show proff of certification in the field. (FYI, there are other gyms that will hire without a certification and let them acquire it later.) The trainer who was texting and not paying attention, I find that odd, since we have a strict no cell phone policy at our location.... but perhaps that particular trainer was breaking rules that day. All trainers are concerned about the welfare and safety of their clients. I can promise you that.\n\nWe recently hired some new managers and things seem to be heading up.... so come on back and check it out!\n\nP.S. Sorry, you've had such a tough time Leslie!",

Very odd water pressure, sort of haphazard spraying, and it's difficult to make the water cold without turning it off completely. They definitely need an update.

But having to document failed attempts at contacting customer service in order to show my bank the lengths I'm willing to go to try and contact these people so my bank could stop all future payments... waste of my time.

The Wi-Fi connection in the cardio areas is terrible, and if it is busy, and you will likely not have a Wi-Fi signal while working out. Also, they get about five channels on the cardio TVs, so if you do not like CNN or ESPN, you're out of luck.",

Gee thanks. The termination process? Not so automatic. \"Mandatory two months notice. In writing. We'll get back to you and let you know when your termination is accepted.\" Another month's fee collected. Two more months go by. FREE AT LAST! But wait... the assholes also collected the next year's annual maintenance fee along with our final month's membership fee.

The weights are hardly ever racked,  and there is no enforcement of any rules. I don't mind the chalk on the floor, it is a gym, there should be chalk but members spill water or whatever on the floor and it will stay there for hours ( it happened tonight and I said something to they young guys that spilled the drink and they just looked at me).\nThe upside is the amount of equipment and weights they have. They even have a room that you can \"CrossFit\" in with a Rogue pull up rig and bumpers, but they are not a CrossFit affiliate nor do they claim to be. \nIf you don't mind a few too many punks and people that don't follow gym etiquette, this gym is pretty good. \nI worked out here for a year and I did not renew my contract.",

I've learned that you don't need a fancy facility to get a good work out if you have phenomenal instructors. \n\nOtherwise my experience is pretty much average, to slightly below average.\n\n1) This gym is a test gym for a new class pass system. Everyone needs to sign up for each class online and then receives a ticket when they get to the gym. The ticket then gets turned into the instructor for entry. It's a pain. People with certain memberships can't sign up online and can't get into classes. I feel like it's a hall pass or something. \n\n2) One of the spin classes I attended on a weekly basis has been canceled and nothing has been put in its place.  Having a class at that time was one of the reasons I signed up for the gym in the first place. \n\n3) I've had an unresolved billing issue that probably will never get resolved. It's ultimately not a lot of money at stake and it's really not even worth my time to follow up anymore, but out of principle this should have been resolved. \n\nAs I mentioned initially, I'm thoroughly enjoying the spin classes but this gym just doesn't warrant the previous 4-star review.",

I've never had to wait too long for my turn on a machine, so the other members here are courteous enough. I don't do personal training but I have noticed that there is a personal trainer here as well as a tanning room. \n\nThe restrooms and equipment are very clean.

It is a very expensive gym but given that, the facilities are great and there are always tons of staff around that are willing to be of assistance. The pool is great, if somewhat crowded, and the locker room facilities with the bathing suit wringer are a nice touch. I generally stick to classes for my workouts and I would give them a B in general. There are LOTS of class options but the cycling classes are not great (as a former SPINNING instructor). Other than that, the yoga and group fitness classes are great. It is always packed, and parking can be a problem, but they always have attendants out in the parking lot to help direct traffic to open spots. It makes me very happy to see people of all ages using the track and working out however I find that sometimes people just let their kids run free instead of actually watching them or sending them to the Kids Zone. It can be very frustrating to be running or walking laps on the track and just have little kids playing all over the place or playing on the gym equipment. One last suggestion would be to add curtains or coverings to the windows in the yoga room, it can be very distracting to have everyone on the track looking in and maybe it would help with some of the noise from the fitness room/basketball court.\n\nOverall, its a great facility. It is a bit expensive for some of the issues it has but I am thankful it is there and I think its a wonderful asset for the community.",

A year after joining, I'm reminded that this is the exact gym that I need. \n\nWhat sets this gym apart is the trainers. Hands on, seasoned and professional trainers, each with different areas of expertise, are enormously committed to the progress of the members.  Since each class is capped at 10 people (my class is usually about half that), the attention by trainers is unsurpassed by any other gym in the area. I feel much safer knowing that the risk of injury is reduced with this level of attention.   \n\nThe owner, Rob, really strives to make this a welcoming community.  Successes and gains are recognized and celebrated by all.  A grueling workout quickly becomes a group effort, rather than an individual ordeal.  It makes it more fun, and it makes you work that much harder and progress that much faster. \n\nI can't speak highly enough for this gym and the trainers. The workouts are harder than you can imagine, but the trainers will give their all to anyone willing to put forth genuine effort.  Hard work is rewarded ten-fold.",

  "text": "I finally willed myself to the pool here this past week. After taking a 4 month break from swimming, I decided to get back into a swimming routine.\n\nFirst, they may say that the pool is 80 degrees-but it certainly isn't when you get in. The positive is that you get moving pretty quickly and you don't want to stop for the first few laps.\n\nI liked pushing myself with a 25 meter distance pool too. Later on in the night, you can also switch over to the 25 yard side, when that area is empty.So going last Thursday and Friday led to some good workouts and I really enjoy how clean the pool is. The weekly hours are pretty good for my schedule too-I just wish that they had the pool open later on the weekend.",

  "text": "This is a small gym as far as gyms go but I like it. \n\npros - All cardio machines have their own tvs, there aren't that many members so there isn't a wait for cardio machines. It's 24 hours. It's cheap. There is a parking garage but I think this past winter there have been a few cars that were broken into so there are cops that stand around the gym/ parking lot at night.  \n\ncons- sometimes it smells in the gym, sometimes it smells in the girls locker room, sometimes it's hot in the gym, sometimes there is weird condensation on the windows, some of the tvs don't work right.\nThere are ellipticals but a few of them make noise or wobble so I can only use a couple of them. No classes at all.  There is not a single clean mat to do sit ups. I wish they would get some clean mats.\n\n\nEDIT 2/2015 \nI will be leaving this gym, the cardio equipment is constantly breaking down and no one repairs it quickly. Many of the TVs don't work at any given time. \nas you see above since the day I joined 2 of the 4 ellipticals without arms wobble and over the next 3 THREE years they have not fixed them. \nmost treadmills don't have a smooth belt\nthe recline bikes at any given time 1-2 of the 4 don't work \n1 of 2 step machines is constantly breaking down \nthe elliptical tracks are NEVER being cleaned inside and 2 of the 4 without arms wobble and shake. \nI would tell someone but they took down their suggestion box a long time ago and the people working there don't look like they care to hear me complain. It's ok I am going to join center of Clayton.",

Classes and more available.\n\nThe costs aren't that bad, either, equivalent to a New York Sports Club or Bally's, actually. Even cheaper as a student (built into your school fees) or a staff member / alumni (varying discounts).\n\nGym gets crowded after 4p until close, also busy towards the early mornings. Students fill most of the structure, but there are also rooms you can sign up for classes, or run your own classes or practice dancing, etc.  Many lockers (get a lock).\n\nFree towel service, and basketball games (half court) running a lot (some full court, too).\n\nThey sell smoothies, here, too, on the ground floor.",

  "text": "This gym should be renamed \"the Dirty Sock Vault\" since that's exactly what it smells like, probably because all the climbing shoes are on the front desk. The stuffiness and poor ventilhation only worsen the odor. But even more annoying is how their specials fail to mention that you need to be an experienced climber to participate. I saw a ladies' night special on their home page and thought that meant I could climb at a discounted rate. But when I got there, an unfriendly man at the desk told me that unless I have 'prior experience' I couldn't participate. That's *probably* something you want to mention on the actual ad, rather than making that info hard to find on another page in your site. He tried to persuade me into paying $50 - and waiting an hour and a half - to take a private course 'so I could learn how to climb and do the special', assumedly at a later date (?). No thanks...\n\nI left and then called the manager, Paul, to explain this and our conversation went as follows. Me: \"Do you agree that your website is misleading?\" Paul: ...\"Yes.\" Me: \"Okay, thanks for wasting my time.\" Paul: \"I'm at a loss as to how to help.\" Well, Paul, you could promise to improve your ads, but I guess that's too complex...or at least that's what Zach, the other manager, claims to be the case. According to him, 'rock climbing is a complex sport to explain on a website.' Because adding 'not available to beginners' on the actual ad is too complex to understand, I guess? \n\nUpdate: After being called six times, I noticed that the gym actually replied to my review but they clearly missed my point. There should be an FAQ page for the specials about who can use them, or just write ON THE AD that it's for advanced climbers. I was busy at work, glanced at the ad on your home page, and thought 'Cool, I'll stop in.' Your site wasn't put together well.",

The room was a little dark, which I didn't think much of at the time.  Amanda was quick, and the situation was painless as it could be.  However, my top half of my legs weren't given much attention - and I was shocked when I was still charged for a full leg wax.  When I got home I realized there were spots that were missed - big ones, like my knees.  I called this morning to see if someone could fix this before I go on vacation tomorrow, and they said none of the waxers were going to be in until after 5.  The receptionist said she would call if someone could take me in.  After not hearing anything for 6 hours, I called again to see the status.  The receptionist said, \"The person who did you isn't coming in today, and my manager won't call me back. I can put you with the other woman, but then she's not getting paid for a service she didn't screw up.\"\n\nIf I'm able to get in tonight, I'll revise the review appropriately.  In the meantime, I'm left feeling salty I'll have to shave my legs on vacation - in random spots!\n\nAlso - I've been here before for a massage and facial.  I had Mackenzie for the facial, and I loved her.  I don't remember who I had for the massage - and I'm not really a massage person, but I found it to be terrible.",

  "text": "I feel like this place was more of a scam mill than a real gym. 90 percent of the people in the classes are newbs doing the challenge leaving what seems to be the other 10 percent as regular members. They are just turning and burning \"new clients\" every six weeks promising to \"change their lives and bodies.\" A few people do have success with this very extreme, unsustainable lifestyle, while the others, like myself, find the rigidity of the program impossible at best, and downright harmful at worst, and will simply be out 500.00. The workouts themselves are great - you will never do the same work out twice, and you will always leave the class extremely exhausted. But if you don't keep up with at least five HOURS of HIGH INTENSITY work outs every week, and do the Facebook check ins (so ridiculous) and every single weekly weigh in, (or at least that's how it was when I did the program) you are automatically disqualified from getting your dough back. \n\nI think the workouts themselves are too intense to be done five days a week for any extended period of time for MOST people. The vast majority of people do not need to work out for five, intense hours per week to be healthy and would do just fine with more moderate intensity stuff, with a few high intensity work outs thrown in here and there. The key is to remain active; you don't have to feel like you're dying for an hour a day to see results. With such lengthy, intense work outs with inadequate rest periods, I saw a LOT of people get injuries and, conveniently for Psychosomatic, have to drop out of the plan (and thus be out their 500.00). I have been working out frequently and intensely for the last ten years, doing running, weight lifting, HIIT training, yoga, Pilates, kickboxing, you name it - and never once had an injury until I did Psychosomatic.\n\nThe other part of it is, the diet is ridiculous. You are getting very few calories to supplement these work outs - for a while I was eating like 900-1000 calories a day - and you are literally shamed if you deviate from the rigid plan in any way. I remember that in the Facebook group a person proudly posted a picture of their meal of ground turkey and vegetables, and one of the team leaders simply posted as a comment \"Are those carrots?????????\" Because carrots are not compliant with this diet - if that is not on the fast track to disordered eating I don't know what is. Fat is not compliant with this diet either, which is also extreme. So you can't eat a carrot or an egg yolk, but you CAN eat a highly processed Quest bar with fake sugar in it, and you can eat whey protein powder as well which an extremely processed food - makes sense. I followed this stuff religiously for about four weeks and missed a period, probably because my body was overworked and under-nourished. I would have liked to have joined the gym to take classes here and there, but because I did not complete the challenge I was disqualified. I got one shot, and I was done. I walked away 500.00 poorer with nothing to show for it except for five lost pounds which I immediately gained back when I started following my usual healthy, but sane, diet.\n\nThe most annoying part of this place was that members HAD to participate in social media or they could not join the challenge - yes, I am not exaggerating. I personally don't want to spam my friends with what is basically forced free advertising for Psychosomatic (Daily check ins! Posting about my non-scale victories! Who the heck wants to see that crap every day? Embarrassing) so I did what any reasonable person would do (LOL) - make a fake, temporary Facebook account (which is also not allowed). You also had to write a review of the gym after you were done. It's unethical and quite frankly slimy and pathetic of them to force the role of advertising onto their clients. Get over yourselves; can't you do business more respectably and let your clients' results speak for themselves?\n\nMy suggestion to Psychosomatic - stop with the scammy \"SIX WEEK CHALLENGE!!!\" These sorts of extreme things are not sustainable or healthy. Encourage healthy habits that are sustainable and realistic, and allow your clients to think long term. Don't shame them for eating a piece of cake on their birthday. Show them how to eat healthy while still allowing them to live their lives. We aren't runway models trying to get skinny for an upcoming fashion show - we are real people with families, and jobs, and struggles, who just want to be a healthier so we can live long, happy lives and feel good in our skin. I think Psychosomatic should be set up like a regular gym with classes that anyone can sign up for, not just challengers or people who have completed the challenge. Basically, if you don't have the extreme mentality you're kicked out of the club.\n\nUse your brain - they are counting on you to fail so that they can turn a profit. They know darn well that when you fork over that 500.00 bucks you'll never see it again!",

I requested one of the trainers to change the Channel to 6 and he said he didn't know how to do it but would ask Steve. Both said OK, but Steve said he had to ask a young woman with straight blonde hair and glasses if  he could change the channel. Well, she must have been a BEE-ATCH because she said no. Huh? Nobody else was watching the TV stations that were on (I checked) and I thought I was supposed to be a customer. I later ran into the same trainer (who now works  at another LA Fitness Center) and he apologized to me for the incident, saying, \"She's a real bee-atch.\" If you want to be customer-oriented, when someone asks for a channel to be turned on, just do it.",

So to me; Get Fit is still Gold's Gym- They are owned by the same people and have the same workers. The only change is a new slap of paint- WOahh! Regardless of the name change- I still love this gym. Most importantly, it's clean. I always see the cleaning crew picking working no matter what time I come in. The Cardio Cinema is the only thing that keeps me sane. A good movie playing in a dark room can double my cardio time! The women's only room is also a big plus since though the general strength area is fully loaded, so are the regulars that inhabit it! Granted this is no LA fitness, and yes some of the machines may be out of order (ps. they have 4 more of the same machine someplace else!) it is still a nice large gym.

  "text": "This LA Fitness location is just okay. Lately, I've noticed their customer service has gone downhill. I started coming to this location in 2009 shortly after my local Bally Total Fitness closed.\n\nThe machines are old and rusty. They seriously need to update their equipment. A lot of the machines have signs on them that say \"scheduled for service\" and it takes days for someone to actually fix them. Majority of the time people get off the machines and don't wipe them down, which is so gross. I don't want to work out on a machine that's covered in sweat. \nIt gets very crowded between the hours of 4-6pm, as most gyms do, and I've found myself waiting for treadmills and ellipticals when I'm there on weekdays. Saturday and Sunday are their slower days. \n\nEmployees at the front desk are miserable. When you walk up to the desk, you feel like you're inconveniencing them. They're too busy being on their personal cell phones texting. They have the easiest job. All they have to do is stand there and scan people's membership cards. They don't even greet customers.

Unless you're looking to pay out your butt for a Y membership or another luxury gym, this Planet Fitness will suffice. I signed up for the Black membership and have been satisfied so far with the gym.\n\nThey do have 2 chair massagers, 3 hydro massage machines, and a couple tanning rooms. There is also a red light therapy machine which they call their \"Total Body Enhancement\" machine. I have used the hydro beds which are nice but have yet to try to get bronze yet.\n\nPlanet Fitness does not have any racks at all! Forget about barbell bench presses, squats, or deadlifts....unless you can get by doing dumb bell or smith machine versions of those. FYI, the free weights only go up to 75lbs. Oh, watch  out for the \"Lunk\" alarm in the free weight area. It's a PF staple but I have yet to hear it go off yet.\n\nIf you're a body builder, don't sign up. You'll hate it. I'm not a body builder but I do like to lift rather than use the cardio machines. If you just want to do cardio or just a casual gym goer...this is your place. \n\nPros:\nLarge open spaces\nClean and new\n11ty million cardio machines\n\nCons:\nFree weights only go up to 75lbs\nNo racks, only smith machines\n11ty million cardio machines",

Last year I had the premium membership and I think I used the massage tables twice and never the classes.  This year I dropped to the basic membership until I can really get into it.  Found out this time that they have a fitness evaluation and me being a big boy need all the help I can get.  I signed up for a session and my roommate had one as well.   I took the later evaluation since my time is more flexible.  I showed up early and checked in told the guy at the desk I was here for my 630 and I was a good 15 mins early, figured time to warm up.  About 625 saw the trainer looking around and figured this was my time, nope he had another person he was working with, so I walked away because I know that this was still the other persons time.  I can wait.  About 645 I went looking for what was going on.  It appears that he was still with the other person and got behind.  I get that but he didn't have the courtesy to say anything to me.  So my next evaluation is in 2 weeks because that is what is available.  I wonder if that one will be booked too.***UPDATE*** Dropped from a 4 to a 2 star for getting caught. The fitness manager called to see what the issue was and to see about how to handle my complaint.  She offered to see me at Thursday at 4pm...Ok but my roommate had her evaluation Thursday at 430pm, they were going to call her and ask her to come in later so they could get me in at 4.  Funny thing was that they had yet to say anything to her first.  That was not the right move.  She was not happy! And the Manager got caught.  She offered another time but when I said \"Wait I was told you are booked for the week\" She just said I will have my other clients move to take care of you.  No thanks I don't want that, so now I am at Platinum Fitness.",
