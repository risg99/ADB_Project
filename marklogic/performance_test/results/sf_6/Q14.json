The quinoa bowl was deliscious, just don't forget to add avocado. If you are lucky Mason will sing for you! Oh and this place has Matcha Green Tea and they know how to properly prepare a straight cup of matcha. A true blessing for matcha lovers.",

  "text": "They have two different menus for you to order from. One is chinese/ Japanese American styled restaurant and one is authentic Chinese food. The regular menu is the same as other restaurant, nothing special about it. The ramen is delicious and I would recommend the black garlic broth with BBQ pork. The egg drop soup is kind of plain and my first take out order egg drop soup actually tasted lightly sour like it's about to go bad. The wonton soup is plain too, but you can tell the wonton are made fresh, not the frozen kind from take out chinese restaurant. The authentic chinese menu are  very good. I like their garlic stirred fried veggies. I can say these menu items are not full of MSG, but lot of spice and soy sauce, sesame oil to make the flavor come out.",

  "text": "I visited this place for the first time tonight with two other couples. I did not particularly like having to pay $5.00 to \"valet\" park my car 20 feet from me. I was stopped when I arrived and told the price. I asked if I could park myself and was told \"no, no one parks themselves.\" I'm perfectly capable of parking my own car AND it cost me $5.00 to park it very close to where I was stopped. I don't agree with that. There's no need for forced valet parking. \n\nTo get to the positive-we were greeted by a friendly young lady when we arrived. We were seated quickly but we did have a reservation. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food dishes ordered at my table ranged from the burger to rabbit fettuccine, fried chicken, stew and meatloaf. Everyone said their meal was delicious. I would return for dinner other than the valet issue which may have me think twice.",

  "text": "Visited Voodoo Gumbo during our visit to Nashville since my husband loves Cajun cuisine which is not readily available in our area.  Drove about 1/2 hr from our hotel to the restaurant which was in a strip mall with TJ Maxx.  Since it was 3:00 in the afternoon the restaurant was empty.  We were instructed to order at the register, the food was freshly cooked &  brought to our table.  My husband had the seafood gumbo (his favorite) which he loved.  He also had the shrimp po'boy & I had the oyster po'boy with coleslaw.\nThere were so many oysters I had to eat 1/2 of them first in order to pick up the sandwich.  Both po'boys were excellent, crispy & \"melted in your mouth\" tender. The po'boys were filling but we had to have the beignets which were hot & delicious. We inquired if there was a Voodoo Gumbo up north but was told by William it was privately owned.   Hi to Joyce & DeAnna who were also friendly & welcoming! We will definitely come back our next visit to Nashville.",

Everything tasted really prepackaged to me. The menu was unique, and they're trying with the different sauces, but the honey Siracha just fell flat. The owners are really nice and the place is cool, but it's just not for us. We won't be back, the authentic Mexican places in glassboro and Washington Township are better choices.",

  "text": "This restaurant was a huge disappointment for me.  I was in the city for one night on business and picked 3 restaurants - couldn't find the other 2 and this was my 3rd choice.  I will not be going back on a future trip.  \n\nThe restaurant was empty, except for one large party.  The staff at the door were friendly and helpful, however one of the kitchen staff actually challenged me about a food allergy after I made a special request.  The server talked a lot about their 'specialties' - which were 'sustainable fish' (in conversation later, I figured out that he didn't even know what sustainable meant), homemade items, and fresh ingredients.  I didn't experience any of the above.\n\nI wasn't sure what to order (the menu does look enticing - with many choices), so I ordered a cup of italian wedding soup while I thought about my meal.  It was the WORST soup I have ever had.  It is NOT italian wedding soup.  The ingredients are prepared separately and then thrown together when ordered.  The broth is like a brine - I only had a few sips and I swelled up the next day.  There were no beans, only flavorless meatballs and uncooked spinach floating in the brine.  I finally decided on a pizza because they insisted seafood was their specialty and I love shrimp on a pizza.  So I asked for the 5 cheese pizza, which is described as a white pie with 5 different cheeses (no tomato sauce).  I asked them to leave off the gorgonzola and add on shrimp.  They got the shrimp right...that was about it.  I basically got a cheese pizza....tomato sauce and all.  All the cheeses are mixed together so you cannot appreciate the flavors of the different cheeses.  As I was taking my pizza in a box to go, I asked the server \"you're sure this doesn't have tomato sauce, right\" and he says \"of course - our 5 cheese pizza never has tomato sauce\".  Wish I had opened the box right there and saved myself the trouble of throwing it away in my hotel room.  Finally, I'll mention my flat sparkling water.  While I waited on my pizza I sat at the bar and had a glass of 'sparkling' water.  Don't order Pellegrino here - they don't even know what it is.  When I asked for a glass, they offered me the wine list.  LOL.  So then I asked for sparkling water and got a very old bottle of not-so-bubbly water.  And when the server asked me if I wanted to take the rest with me, I told him 'no thanks, it was flat anyway' and he didn't offer to do anything about it.  The only reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that the bread was amazing.  But I highly doubt it's made in house!",

  "text": "My experience here is hit or miss, depending on what area of the facility you're in.  The key to having a good time here is to go during non-peak hours.\n\nService in the sit-down eating area - hit or miss, leaning towards hit.  Sometimes we get friendly, attentive service.  Other times, deplorable.  It all depends on the server and how busy the place is.  Food is solid.  I especially like the nachos.\n\nThey have good pool tables.  Again, service around the pool tables is hit or miss.  Pricing for pool table use is acceptable during non-peak hours.  \n\nArcade area and bowling area are standard D&B style.  There's sometimes a really long wait for bowling.  But there's enough other stuff to do in the meanwhile, if you're that set on bowling during peak hours.",

We placed and paid for our orders with the cashier, and a food runner brought our food out to our table, in about 10ish minutes. I ordered the Chicken bowl, which was pretty filling. The bowl itself wasn't the most flavorful, but I was able to spruce it up with their hot sauces, which they had quite a variety of at a sauce bar. I'd pop by here again when I'm in the area, if I'm craving tex mex, but I'll definitely explore other options first if I'm feeling adventurous.",

Service was very friendly and fast. Definitely a good spot to go for a break time snack.",

The sandwich was huge and after combo'ing it there was way too much food for one person to eat. I liked being able to get a bottle of water as my drink in the combo meal. I made 2 meals out of it, literally! My friends tried the California Pesto and the Greek, both with the vege patty, and they both said they were really good. \n\nSlightly more expensive than I like to spend (but I'm cheap) but the extra money was worth it to know I was getting fresh & green!!!",

I would suggest that they either make smaller batches during the day, or reheat it outside of the styro cup and stir it once or twice while reheating before handing to the customer.  The ambience is good, it's warm and indoors for Californians freezing their butts off.\n\nTHE BAD: CASH ONLY - CASH ONLY - CASH ONLY. BE WARNED. DING THEM A STAR FOR THIS.",

I ordered the jackfruit tacos with a side of avocado, which were served in lettuce cups and beautifully seasoned (you would never guess it's made from the smelliest fruit in the world) and very yummy. I also really appreciated the generous size of the avo side (1/2 the fruit) when you normally only get a couple slices at other places. BF had the potato latkes with a side of poached egg and also really enjoyed it. We're both meat eaters but I just wanted to try something new. The kombucha they had on that day was also really good (passion green tea, I believe) and even after we had declined dessert and paid the check, they presented us with a sample of their delicious baklava and soy ice cream, which was just the perfect finish to our meal! I've had baklava in Turkey and this was really amazing, so that should say something. Really worth trying this place!",

Their dill pickle soup (which I tried from a friend's bowl) is to die for. If you like pickles, and I DO (it's the only thing Snookie and I have in common), you can't miss with this. I actually ordered their soup special for the day though, the corn chili chowder (meatless) and that my fellow yelpers was amazing! I also ordered the birdseed salad and found it to be very tasty! \n\nFor desert, I got a pretzel...yes i said pretzel ice cream cone and stayed pretty safe and went with their chocolate ice cream. It was sweet and salty and hit the spot! My friends got the pineapple upside down cake and it was quite the sweet treat! I am SO getting that next time and suggest you do too!\n\nOne down, I will say is one of my friends got the grilled cheese sandwich with apples on it and halfway through her meal, realized there weren't any apples on it. She didn't want to complain so she didn't say anything. I am sure if she would have, they would have offered a new sandy, at least I hope they would.\n\nOne other slight annoyance, is that when we got there, the seating seemed to be a bit unorganized and we were taken to one table but then it was dirty so then we went to another. No biggie but I will say while our server was certainly sweet, he moved a little on the laid back/slow side. We had to wait longer than I think we should have, given the lack of a huge crowd.\n\nOverall, though I would totes recommend this place and I sent my sister and niece that way this weekend while they are in town. I hope they leave with happy tummies...I think they will y'all!",

This location is more cafe style- which was actually perfect bc I would always stop to pick up lunch anyway. The owners are such lovely people. Everything is homemade and tastes absolutely delicious, and I was glad to see them keep some of my favorites from the old menu (like the cilantro chicken sandwich). They're so accommodating too. They have a regular menu and specials that always sound amazing- it's so hard to choose! My only qualm is that parking in that little plaza can get terrible so sometimes I don't stop just because of parking.

Upon entering the establishment I was glad to see most of the tables full at 3 pm -- good sign.  \n\nI was first in line to order ... And there were 2 gals present to assist w/ the order ... Surprisingly, I wasn't greeted or even acknowledged for 5 minutes!!!!!  The chick answered the Phone while I patiently waited ... Not even once making eye contact!!  That should've been the sign .... \n\nTwo (2) cheesesteaks ordered; 1 American wit & 1 Provo wit/out .... They charge an extra buck for the cheese on a cheesesteak (what?!?) ... Ended up getting one as a combo which included fries & a soft-drink ... Total was $22 bucks!!  \n\nWaited about 7 mins for my order.  Upon calling my number (same rude chick at the counter) I expressed my order was to go & politely asked for a bag ... To which her reply was, \"you'll have to wait a minute!\" Excuse the *^#¥ out of me ... But she did manage to hand me a bag this allowing me to bag my own food - how Customer Service is that?! \n\nNow on to the food review -- the sandwiches were average size.   Cheese was properly melted & distributed throughout ... The drip factor was present but the meat wasn't chopped up ... Ok, not a big deal ... But upon biting in the meat was a little chewy .... Flavor was mediocre but enough to fill the roll.  Onions had a decent flavor but that was about all I can say about that.  \n\nOverall, I would NOT go back.  There are many better places to give your money for a better quality experience & service.   Try Campos nearby for a much better experience from friendly to quality!   In fact, I've got a better local location in Orlando, FL from a Philly transplant who opened his shop called Brianto's!!  Well worth it as he uses best quality meat & flies in Amoroso rolls to add that authentic experience!",

The DJ is decent and they play a good combination of pop and hip-hop hits that you can definitely boogie to.  Also the dance floor is not usually super packed and people are generally having a decent time. \n\nIt is usually pretty dark in the whole place and I wouldn't recommend coming here to have  casual beer with your friends and chat.  This is more of a bar for the end of the night when you just want to let loose.  Drink prices are reasonable and they usually have some solid beer choices on tap.  I've never been here for the food...it feels more like a dirty dance floor club to me but I imagine it looks nice during the day too.  A very interesting building from the outside though I've seen one too many drunk girl fall down the stairs out front...",

  "text": "I love this place so much that I don't even know where to begin this review.  I have dined or had drinks here at least 25 times over the last five years.  I have never had a less than perfect experience or less than perfect meal.\n     Starting with the atmosphere, what can I say that has not been said before?  The place is gorgeous, no really.... it is stunning.  The old converted church is lovely in every possible way and exudes charm from every corner both inside & out.\n     This is an elegant establishment and I just don't think we have enough of those in a world that is becoming ever more casual.  Check in with the host, check your coat and hang out at the bar.  They have a nice wine list that will surely have something for your enjoyment.  The bartenders have been the same for years & will create some of the finest cocktails in New Hope - I recommend the classic Martini.  The host will come get you when your table is ready and whisk you away to a romantic dining room on the second floor.  Look around as you climb the stairs, there is a lot to see in this beautiful old church.  \n     The grand dining room is large, complete with stunning art and magnificently high ceilings.  The tables for couples will be adorned with red rose petals.  \n     The food has always been exceptional, understand it is Southern cooking, Creole to be exact - lots of seafood, lots of classics such as jambalaya & gumbo.  The fresh French baguette they bring over is always warm, flakey in the outside and delicate on the inside.  The service has never been less than five stars.  I always like a little banter with whomever is serving and my last experience here was no exception.  Our server both entertained us with his quick wit and informed us about everything we considered on the menu.\n    We both ordered the beet salad with spinach & goat cheese as our starter and as a vegetarian I got the Eggplant Napoleon as my meal.  Creamy, buttery, fresh, flavorful with just the right spice to make an impression - delicious!!!  Naturally dessert had to be ordered and I got the carrot cake, be warned - it is a very large piece and is served with a scoop of homemade ice cream.  I couldn't finish the whole thing & I never leave dessert unfinished on my plate.  \n     As I said at the start, I have never had less than a five star experience at Marsha Brown's and will be back again in a few weeks.",

  "text": "UPDATE: 7/10/2019\n\nToday I got a burger with American cheese, bacon, and extra onions. I've got to say, I have found my new favorite burger place and that goes for all of US as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what they put in it but it's got me coming back for more.\nJust look at the photo and you can see the pickles are perfectly sliced thin, crispy, they're not too thick, the onions are sliced perfect, tomatoes are sliced perfect and all laid out in the right order. The shredded lettuce is just enough to hold it all together and keep things from sliding off. The buns are toasted perfectly. All together every bite was great. I hate when you buy a meal like a burger and every other bite, or only three or four bites, are good. Every bite of this burger was balanced with everything. That's a hard thing to do.\nKeep up the good work!\n\nOk, I do not understand how this place receives 3.5 stars. \nStaff are amazingly friendly and professional. Food is fantastic. Easy in and out. Big diverse menu. Real quality meat. What else could you ask for?\nI have hade the classic cheesesteak with extra cheese about 7 times now. Always great. Hot, fresh, packed with yumminess.\nI tried the French Dip recently and it's now my absolute fav in Boise area. The AuJus is rich and piping hot. Good flavor, not watered down. \nI will share a \"mishap\" that happened yesterday though. \nI ordered this sandwich and got something that didn't even look close to what I had last time. Meat was fine, as usual, but the provolone cheese was grated and lumpy. WHAAAAAT?!?! No go. \nI took it up to the counter and explained politely that doesn't even look good. \nThey gasped exactly as I did then after apologizing hurriedly remade a new one. They explained why that happened, which usually I don't care about but because I really like this operation I appreciated, then brought me my delicious masterpiece. \nOk, maybe not masterpiece but it was fabulous. Juicy, cheesy, bread was so soft and lightly toasted it was as if it came out of the oven two mins prior. SO fresh. \nIncredible meal. \nDon't forget to get a frequent buyer card and always ask for your military discount (if applicable). They'll ask for proof so no fakeys or posers. \nGet ther\nEnjoy",

  "text": "This was my first wine bar after moving from Atlanta to St Pete. What makes this place so freakin awesomely versital is the layout and multiple seating options. It has a nice but small bar around the bartendar that seats about 10 people. It has another ledge and stool chairs that acts as a bar (but no bartender there). It has multiple tables and sitting areas to accomodate groups of people. And it has a couple of handsome sofas (and not something that looks like it wasa reject picked up on frat row) that allow for an intimate experience that great for a date where you could actually carry on a conversation. They even have a very small patio area too - only big enough for a small group though.\n\nThere are waiters assigned to the seating areas, so this is not one of those help-yourself to a wine spout on the wall establishments. They also have beer here if you want to be that way but no open bar. \n\nThe reason I chose this as the first wine bar was because it did look elegant and not like some hole in the wall but also b/c it was the only one open until Midnight on a Friday. Most of the other wine bars in the area close at 10pm! Wussies. 10pm is a pathetic closing hour for a wine bar on a Friday night.\n\n\nWhat also makes this place kinda cool and they seem to always have events or specials or something going on here. From the calendars I've seen they seem to consistently have a \"SUPER\" happy hour every last Friday of the month that last from 4pm to Midnight.\n\nMy only complaint was the music. No, the volume was fine; it was suicide-inducing theme that ran with every song selction. You know - sad Adel songs, Bruno Mars songs and the like. I'm like - are they purposely playing these depressing tunes to engage you to drown more of your sorrows in more wine?\n\nWe'd go back though. Hopefully Pandora or whatever they decide to play will be less depressing.",

So, when we went in the only options for us to choose from were ribs and pulled pork. We also got the baked beans and cole slaw.\n\nThe ribs were good, very moist. The pulled pork was nothing special. We did like the hot BBQ sauce (mild was very bland), and the sides we ordered. They felt bad they were out of all their food and did throw in extra ribs and pulled pork to help make up for it. Because of their great service, we will definitely come back during a busier time (maybe Summer?) and give them another shot!",

It fell out of my rotation when I couldn't count on being there before opening to secure a table or late enough to avoid an hour or more wait (no reservations accepted).  I had heard that the restaurant changed hands and intended to revisit.  Finally I did and was happy with the results.  Despite there being no cocktail list on the menu, I was able to impress upon the waiter my interest in a well crafted cocktail and was rewarded with an ingenious beverage involving gin, cilantro, muddled cucumber and other things.  It was rather delicious.  The appetizers including crab cakes, portabello blue cheesecake, and something resembling a pasty were phenomenal.  My lamb shank was very good as well.  I could give this restaurant 5 stars, but a couple of the sauces were not quite as good as everything else.  I will definitely return.",

Liquid ravioli with crab. Something with bacn foam on top. It just went on and on every 10 minutes and each was perfect.\nSalad with 5 lettuces' had a wonderful dressing and the Pork app. was wonderful. \nPoached lobster was as good as anywhere and the lobster bisque in a small cup was the best ever. Not thick like most, but more of a hearty type broth. Hard to describe, but if it's on the menu, get it. The chicken was a type of bird from China that was on the small side, but pure white when you cut into it and had a wonderful taste.\nMy only complaint , and it's minor, was the choice of dessert. The donuts with dipping sauce were not on a par with the rest of the evenings food.\nThey were a little chewy , not light like I thought they would be. The dipping sauces were good, but next time there were other desserts that I would try.\nService was attentive, parking is what you can find on the street, and at night the place can be a little hard to find, but just look the sign at the corner of 45th and Larchwood.\nIf people asked me for a BYO in downtown I would say this first and Fond second.

I've had their Bloody Mary before and it's fantastic. However, I'm a big craft beer fan and Datz always has a huge selection of good beers to choose from.

The menu is always changing and I always like to try something different when I come here, so while I can't recommend one specific dish, I can pretty much recommend everything.

The person who answered the phone to answer our question was very nasty.  \n\nI do not like \"resorts\" where exercise room and/or spa are not in main building.

The steak, oysters and baked potato no better than what you'd get at Outback. The spinach, or cheese with green stuff mixed in, is truly awful.  I'd say go to the bar for drinks but avoid the food.

The bar takes up a lot of room inside, but there's plenty of seating available. Mark and team is making some great brews.. I'm a big fan of the Coconut Porter and the Big Ed IPA (throwback to the days of ATA) is always a winner. I've heard they're currently making the third batch of this IPA that was originally supposed to be a limited release.\n\nNow, you could stop just with the beer and be quite happy, but if you're hungry, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the food menu and grab a bite to eat. The kitchen is in the basement and the chef puts out some killer grub. Nope, no simple fried bar food here. Instead, you can get a great salad or a sandwich or even an entree that will go great with whatever you're drinking. \n\nI'm keeping this place on my radar..

I agree wholeheartedly with some of the prior reviews expressing that this place delivers anything but FAST food. I went to the Bryn Mawr location for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place was deserted and yet they still took about 20 minutes to make two egg wraps, one smoothie, and sweet potato hash. Totally unacceptable! No sense of urgency and overall, the staff seemed like they had no idea what they were doing. No greeting when I arrived and no apology when they took forever to make my order, looking like bewildered, incompetent idiots the whole time. Very frustrating and irritating experience, and I won't be back to the Bryn Mawr location ever again. They really need to work on training their employees and making sure they know how to make what is on the menu quickly. I don't think that's too much to ask.",

Yes, it is often full of senior citizens, but I don't mind that lol! It tastes like home cooking and the portion sizes are large enough to get two meals out of it. \nRecommend getting the soups, any hot sandwiches and the strawberry cheesecake is to die for!",

  "text": "Me and my wife stopped in for happy hour on Weds night @5:30. The place wasn't busy yet. We sat there for 20 mins before anyone came to our table. I ended up waiting 45 min to get a beer. The first beer I ordered  came after 15 mins of ordering it and it was flat. I took it up to the counter to let them know. The rude waitress told me to go sit down and they would pour me another beer. When I told her that I thought ther must be an issue with the keg. She repeated harshly for me to take a seat and they would pour me another of the same beer . I then went and found our actual waitress and told her I wanted a different beer. The other waitress came over and told her to pour me another of the same beer . Again telling me to go sit . We got our food and I tried the Caesar salad. The salad was drowning in dressing that  was like watered down mayonnaise. There was something in a small condiment cup that looked and tasted like it had been scraped off of the bottom of the fridge. Finally after 45 mins my beer was delivered to me. We had ordered the \" special which was falafel plate .It  was deep fried to the point where it was hard to bite into. I opted not to eat any of the food . My wife was hungry so she nibbled at the gross food. I wanted to send it all back , pay for our drinks and leave but instead we left most of the food on our plates finished our drinks. Paid for the disgusting food and left a nice tip for the poor service. Not going back to this place . It's sad because we like the atmosphere and it has been fun taking friends from out of town there. Never again. Our actual waitress was nice and friendly and was juggling tables while the nasty waitress chatted with a table of friends , she also almost did a faceplant because of the inappropriate shoes she was wearing.",

Their service game is lacking though, we pretty much had to ask for everything and there was no smile or any warmth with the service. It's kinda off putting when you're eating and you have to ask for simple things constantly with a cold ok. I felt like I was bothering my server and usually I don't mind if my server isn't very talkative but this was more like she was not wanting to be there. Oh well maybe it was a bad day. Regardless if you're in the area it's not a bad place to get food just don't expect exceptional service.",

Great coffee, and a good place to read or laptop browse for a few hours. I would say this isn't the best place is you're looking to study intently- People watching is distracting and in general there are no nooks or crannies that you can stick yourself in to have some privacy. \n\nIt is great for what it is- a little hide away to grab some coffee to start your morning and do some reading with a generally quiet crowd that keeps to itself.

I couldn't finish them. The side items included macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and slaw. I was not impressed with any of these. All were flavorless and the greens weren't fresh at all. It was like they were taken right out of can and put on my plate. I will give them refit for the presentation of the meal. It was spot on. The staff was friendly and overall I had a great time there. I will go back just to hang out and enjoy the music with friends but I don't think I'll eat there.",

Spiced just like I love it. I had the short rib hash. The ingredients were very fresh, I highly recommend this dish. Let me turn this over to my beautiful GF to describe her dish. :) I ordered the breakfast sandwich. Brioche bun, avocado, egg, bacon, with a side salad-what more could you want?!

  "text": "Definitely the trendiest-looking Vietnamese restaurant I have ever dined in. You can tell it's not your usual pho spot when you walk in and there's no smell of fish sauce lingering around. \n\nMy group decided to let me choose my post-Broad Street Run brunch. I asked them how Le Viet's Cafe Sua Da is and it took no further discussion. After twenty minutes of circling the blocks around Le Viet, we found parking (thank Buddha, I was starving). The restaurant wasn't too busy for a Sunday during brunch hour. Worked out well for us and we were seated right away.\n\nSince I knew I was going to be gorging at some type of buffet in the evening as my BSR reward to myself, I opted for small items. I ordered Goi Cuon, Banh Xeo, and a Cafe Sua Da. Little did I know, the appetizers were not small at all. The Goi Cuon was stuffed with noodles, a little too much in my opinion. But the dipping sauce was delicious.\n\nThe size of the Banh Xeo was on a different level. It was probably the size of a cheesesteak! Unlike traditional restaurants that overfill the Vietnamese crepe with bean sprouts, this one had a lot of pork and shrimp, very tasty. Beware, the dish is served with a tremendous amount of vegetables that you will probably not finish.\n\nMy Vietnamese iced coffee finally arrived after my meal was almost finished. Not sure what took so long, but the server apologized. It was ready to drink in a plastic cup with a straw, no drip cup necessary.\n\nGood company and good food helped ease the soreness from running ten miles, until I had to get up. I had a good experience at Le Viet and will be back soon!",

  "text": "The menu reads really interesting, some really interesting sandwich concepts, but they don't eat like they read. The sandwich ideas are awesome, the execution on them just doesn't hold up. Regular deli turkey on the turkey sandwich? It says citrus sous vide, but I don't taste it. Maybe I was expecting something more, but I wasn't expecting regular old deli meat at this sort of craft style sandwich shop. Maybe I came in with incorrect expectations of what Tasso was going to be. The bread, and let me preface this by saying LOVE crusty baguettes, was hard to eat. This bread would be perfect with some soup, but not in a sandwich. The roof of my mouth was destroyed after the sandwich, but r takes more than that to get me to put down a sandwich so I continued.. The rest of the toppings were good, but nothing amazing. The pickle was drastically, like somebody messed up on the amounts of the brine, salty.. so much that I couldn't even eat it. The side of mojito cucumber salad was plain and boring and not seasoned at all. Somebody forgot the seasoning or vinaigrette. Wasted 4.00 on that side, I took one bite and just put it to the side. Thankfully.. the meal was saved by the cheapest, insignificant addition to the meal, the popcorn. The popcorn (self serve) was great. I'm guessing curry or garam masala is the spice, but it's a great snack to have with a sandwich. \n\nI hope they work on the execution in the kitchen and shore up some of the recipes, I'd love to come back and try a different sandwich! They do read well, I hope some of the others have a bit better execution.",

  "text": "Great diner-esque food with a huge pastry bakery case up front. My friend and I were getting hungry and I've seen signs all over for Ponzio's and thought it would be a great time to check it out.\n\nOur first server was a little..odd. But she had to leave half-way through and the next server was ok, but she was semi staring at us once in awhile. This was about 5pm on a Saturday and it was packed. \n\nTo start out, the green bean fries were tasty and the philly cheesesteak spring rolls were super hot, crispy and flavorful. Being as hungry as I was, and knowing I can't actually eat that much I wanted something I could easily heat up the next day as well. Answer- chicken parm with a side of angel hair pasta. Huge portion! Everything was cooked perfectly with a really nice tomato sauce. My friend got a Reuben and loved every bite.  \n\nThe menu was large with a copious amount of options. I was deciding between shrimp scampi, strip steak, blackened chicken wrap.. I was on the point of being hangry, but the chicken parm hit the spot.",

This city has so many great cheesesteak joints that it's easy to judge if it's going to be good or not but this spot hit it out of the park. Got a chicken cheesesteak, and they use real marinated chicken breast which was deliciously awesome, and it was huge!!! I refuse to eat the chicken steak that other places sell, stuff is fake! A plus was that they sell beer too so I got a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down. Definitely will be back to try the regular cheesesteak which looked awesome as well. I also like that they chop the steak.

Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.

The poutine was all around delicious; it's heavy, but not overly so. I've tried the tater tots, too, which also have that killer seasoning on them. If you like chicken, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. I haven't used the drive thru, but it's a great feature to have. The food has always been prepared quickly, as well.",

It's always full, no matter what night and expect a 15-30 minute wait, but you can go for a walk while waiting or have a drink.  \n\nThe food is awesome although I generally go for the a la carte items.  Their best in my opinion are:\n\nOysters Rockafeller - best I've had at any restaurant. Always get them. \nBeer boiled shrimp\nOyster Shooters\nBaked climbs\nCalamari - they are known for their calamari.\n\nThe staff is always great and usually cute girls. Prices are good and the view of the harbor is awesome. I suggest you ask to wait for an outside table for better views and a bit less crowding although you won't have a ton of elbow room wherever you sit. \n\nIt's defiitely on my top 5 restaurants I go to, especially when wanting to show a friend from out of town, a Santa Barbara experience.",

  "text": "I think this place is a touch overrated, but it's still a solid dining option in the Cherry Hill area. Met some friends for dinner last evening and were seated at a nice booth in the dining room. Ordered cocktails, which took much longer than expected to arrive. We ordered some of their small, shared plates after we ordered the drinks, and those arrived before the drinks showed up. \n\nWe ordered the breads and spreads, the burrata, two of the bloody beet salads, and a cheese plate to start. I highly recommend the bloody beet salad- it had a great yogurt sauce and was just really light and fresh. I could have done without some of the things on the breads and spreads platter- the chick pea fries were a little soggy, but there was an interesting kale fritter thing with a yogurt sauce that was very good. The burrata dish was very unique so props for thinking outside the box! I could have done with less of the toppings and more of the burrata itself. I think the proportions were a bit off. The bread it was served on was basic and forgettable, but the \"butternut peperonata\" that it was served with was delicious!\n\nI ordered the shrimp & grits, which were good, except that the proportions were off again. Massive grit cakes, and only 4 shrimp. The short ribs were delicious, very tender and, the veggies were great. A friend ordered the seared tuna served on a pesto risotto. The tuna itself was overcooked, but she said the risotto was excellent. The other three ordered sandwiches and raved about them. I think that might be the way to go. Everybody, except myself, had been there several times before, and were raving about the open faced greens sandwich. \n\nNot sure I'd go back, but now I'm very interested in trying out their Philly location to compare!",

  "text": "Went here on a cheap date night. We started with flaming saganaki for a appetizer, which was delicious. Reminiscent of fondue, it was a nice serving of hot, Greek cheese and wine set ablaze. The flavors, salty and tangy, were fantastic. The appetizer came with two pita breads, which was not enough for the generous portion of cheese. Unfortunately our dining experience went downhill from there. It was a Tuesday and there were at most two other small parties, yet our beverages weren't offered to be refilled until towards the end of the meal. We would have asked for more pita bread for our appetizer, had our server been anywhere to be found. Our Greek pizza arrived after quite a wait. The thin crust was not too thin nor too thick and was the best part of the pizza. The cheese was overly abundant (way too much) and the other toppings scant. Red onion, bell pepper, beef gyro, tomatoes, and kalamata olives sounds yummy, but in such small quantity didn't give much flavor. I was confused as to a single dolmade placed in the middle of the pizza. I love dolmades, but just one on a pizza? Odd. In the end, the Greek pizza was completely lacking in the flavors I love about Greek food. Given the slow service, I was able to fully \"appreciate\" the \"interesting decor.\" Well, someone definitely loves artificial greenery in cheap hanging baskets. Red vinyl tablecloths provide additional divey feel. The appetizer alone would get four stars. Service and pizza way less. So I will call it two. Not likely to return.",

Their salad is usually awesome.,plus I love all the add Ins such as cheese, olives, hot peppers and more.\n\nThe staff is always great as well.\n\nOne day, we will have to try them for dinne\n\n  I'm going to update my review. I have been back several times since this first review and on occasion I find that the salad is just fair. Sometimes their great salad really pops with amazing flavor. Today it tasted very flat and it's felt or seemed that it had to been out for sometime, and I arrived upon the store opening. The pizza was good as always and I only eat the vegetarian pizza so that's all I can come in on. \n\nAs I love salads, I may not go back as often as I had been since the salads have been somewhat less enjoyable. \n\nAs always the staff is great.",

I would love to give it 5 stars but I can't recommend the prime rib or any steaks we have ordered as they are consistently super fatty and they use a very strong black pepper crust recipe. If that's what you like, you'll be in heaven! :) I order the wings or the pork lately and it's always delicious but brunch is where the party's at. Hoping the Brewery will open again soon, we always had a good time when bands or karaoke were happening!",

I ordered the Nashville chicken bone in hot chicken wings. They definitely weren't hot but seasoned well. They are served with pickles which is awesome and goes with the \"Nashville\" name.\nAs a table we also had the Coney Island poutine and a Meatzorilla pizza. \nPoutine was good but just like most stacked fries or nachos the top layer has all the toppings then you have a ton of naked friends/chips left.\nThe Roadstone Meatzorilla pizza was great! Loaded up with meat and cheese. I would recommend getting it \"well done\" if you like a crisper bite. Otherwise the pizza was great! \nAlso had a blood orange sour from their tap, Five foot freak. It was good but just seemed to be missing \"something\". \nMy only complaint is that they offer certain apps at $3.33 between certain hours. They have the list inside each menu. After our group finally agreed on a few apps the waiter came back as said \"I was just informed we aren't doing the discount on weekends\". There was no days listed on the app list only times. I'd recommend they remove the advertisement during the weekend or list the days that these items are offered. \nThe server did ask if we had a Sahm's card and explained what it was but never offered to sign any of us up even after we all said we were first timers ‍",

My dining partner and I split the roast beef and pork  sandwiches.   We ordered combos which means you want it with sharp provolone.   Fries and drinks are not included.   The roast beef sandwich was reminiscent of the old Drexel Ale House in the Bond Shopping Center.   Both sandwiches were tender and replete with gravy so don't come here without expecting to get your fingers dirty.  Service is on paper plates with plastic forks.   Parking is tight.   Sandwiches are around $6.50.   Plain fries are $2.50.",

We had the appetizer of Tam Yum Goon which was similar to crab rangoon but much better quality! And the sweet chili sauce that went with it was to die for. We each got Pho which is a broth with your choice of noodle and protein, bean sprouts, cilantro, spicy peppers, basil and seaweed.

There was only one person upfront and she had to take orders and serve the finished foods. This made it so incredibly slow. There were only six people in line and we waited for almost 20 minutes. Talk about fast food. In addition, in plan view of the window you could see large amounts of food dropped on the floor. I can't blame the employees,  but only the incredibly poor manafeme",

  "text": "Edley's was recommended by a local during our visit to Nashville. Having grown up on the south, this is hands down THE BEST BBQ EVER!  \n\nWhen we arrived, their power had been out and had just barely come on. They had told us that it might be a little bit of a wait to cook our food and to pay. However we had our food within 10 minutes.\n\nI had the special of the day, which was a barbecue pork sandwich with grilled peaches, called Sweet Georgia Brown.  My husband had the hot chicken platter. Both were amazing. The plug of coleslaw had an amazing sweet vinegar taste, nothing I have ever had before. The grits casserole were amazing with the Gouda cheese base, jalapeños, pepper and onion. They were definitely a must try. The baked beans melted in your mouth.  We also had drinks from the bar. My husband had a Mohito which was quite tasty. But my bourbon cocktail was something that made you feel like you were sitting on an old porch in a rocking chair, sipping from an old Mason jar. To end our night, we shared a piece of pecan pie which tasted just as good as my mom's homemade pie.\n\nNot only was the food absolutely delicious, but the service was quick, even with their power outage, friendly and above superior. In fact, when we went back up to pay, the manager whoever was in charge, told us that we did not need to pay and thanked us for our patients. I would have gladly have paid twice as much as what our final bill was. It was something I would definitely return to and would recommend to all locals and anyone passing by the area. You do not want to miss this taste of southern deliciousness heaven.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I tried City Winery for a Griffin House show in mid-November one Wednesday night. Mostly we wanted to see the new concert behemoth of SoBro (I still hate the name SoBro). \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere. This place is beyond superlatives beautiful and tasteful, all at the same time. They've made it obvious it's a nicer place without overwhelming the concert-goer seeking to just enjoy a show with a nice glass of wine. They'll start making their own wine here in 2015 so we'll be interested to go back and see even more of this gorgeous venue.\n\nThe wine. I'm just starting to understand different types of wines and an amateur at best in describing what I want in a wine. The waiter was well-trained and did not lead us astray when we were making our selection from the multiple wines on tap, available for a glass, and those available by a bottle. We tried a couple of these before we left and weren't disappointed. \n\nThe food. It was good, not great. I had the leg of lamb pizza, which was tasty with a good mix of spices, crunchy pine nuts, and melty cheese. She got the Chicken Fricassee which was good but reminded me of much less expensive items I've had elsewhere. The food was tasty and good to munch on during a show or for dinner. I'm probably going to have dinner elsewhere the next time we visit City Winery, however.\n\nPros: Amazing building and predictably great wine selection.\n\nCons: Food was kind of expensive and didn't blow me away. The parking was pretty terrible. They offered paid valet or you can park on the streets, which is not the best option in this neighborhood.\n\nOverall: This a relaxing, romantic place to take a date for a concert. You will win friends  and influence people if you bring someone from out of town in for a concert. If you can stand the parking situation and high-priced food, you'll be elated to make this spot one of your regulars!",

  "text": "After ten years as Executive Chef for the Century Hospitality Group, Chef Paul Shufelt decided it was time to start up a restaurant of his own. The Workshop Eatery officially opened a couple weeks ago in The Mosaic Centre, Canada's largest net-zero commercial building. Choosing to open up in a sustainable building definitely poses its challenges, but supporting local producers, sustainability, and using seasonal produce are concepts important to Chef Paul. \n\nThe Workshop Eatery is located in the far south neighborhood of Summerside, which can be a fair drive for many in Edmonton. But once you enter the building you're greeted by an open space and living wall, which shows how unique and beautiful the Mosaic Centre really is. As for the restaurant, you're greeted into a space that is warm, rustic and inviting. I love the open concept and the visibility of the kitchen - there's nothing to hide! \n\nThroughout the different seasons, the menu will consist of roughly 20 staple dishes and a different feature each day. What makes the menu seasonal will be the different accompaniments and sides to a main dish. If you're ever wondering what's on the menu on a particular day, just check the website! It's amazing that they will be updating their online menu daily! \n\nWe started off our meal with a couple of appetizers, first up was the Arancini ($12). The arancini at Workshop changes daily, and the \"New York Deli\" arancini with deli meats, a balsamic tomato smear, and Nefiss Lazizz Olive Oil was the feature for the day. These fried risotto balls had a golden, crisp exterior, and broke open to reveal a creamy mix of risotto, green peas, and small morsels of meat. I personally prefer my arancini to be rich and cheesy, so these arancini didn't quite deliver for me. \n\nNext up came the Chicken Liver Parfait ($11) served in a small mason jar with crostinis made from Bon Ton Bakery's Cranberry Raisin Nut Bread. The liver was whipped with a mousse-like texture and topped with a port and Saskatoon berry jam. It was a perfect balance between sweet and savoury, and I loved the different textures that the crostini added to the mixture.\n\nOur last starter for the meal was the Duck Carpaccio ($17) featuring Moosewood Acres cured duck breast, pickled shiitakes, carrots, daikon, a soy reduction and blood orange vinaigrette. I really enjoyed the fragrant orange paired with the duck, and the tang of the vinaigrette, but found that the dish was much too salty. Typically a carpaccio dish features meat that is extremely thinly sliced or pounded thin, but the duck in this carpaccio was thickly sliced. The thick slice combined with the soy reduction was quite salty, so with some adjustments to the cut and seasoning, I would really enjoy this dish!\n\nJust like the arancini, The Workshop Eatery has a feature dish each evening. On the night of our visit Tangle Ridge Lamb Chops were being served with a butternut squash, corn and bacon hash. The lamb chops were moist and tender, and looked beautiful against the brightly coloured hash. The hash itself was naturally sweet but lacking in smokiness which we expected from the bacon. As it turns out, we didn't find much bacon in the hash either, so that could have accounted for the discrepancy. \n\nFor myself I ordered the Duck Duck Couscous (how fun is that to say?!) ($32) which featured beautifully seared Moosewood Acres duck breast on a bed of warm couscous with raisins, almonds, pickled cherries and vanilla parsnip puree. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium, and the lightly sweet couscous was a great companion to the duck. The parsnip puree was also a delightful addition to the dish, and complemented both components on the plate. Although I love lamb, the duck was definitely the winner for me and I would happily order it again. \n\nWhen it came down to the desserts, I was torn between two options. The panna cotta at The Workshop Eatery is made with the rooftop honey and would have been my first choice, but I couldn't resist the Croissant Bread Pudding ($9). The flaky croissant pieces are paired with white chocolate and cranberry, giving this dessert some tart notes to balance the sweet. Topped with a generous scoop of Pinocchio's cinnamon ice cream, this was a comforting dessert that I would eat again. \n\nTaken as a whole, we had a great dinner at The Workshop Eatery: our dishes were good and the service was attentive. If there's one thing I love about The Workshop Eatery, it's their commitment to sustainability and supporting local producers. Their decision to move into the Mosaic Centre means that the drive to their restaurant is long and far for many patrons, but the principles of the building align with the values of the restaurant. It's great to see so many local farmers mentioned throughout the menu, and I think it will be interesting to see how things shift once the growing season in Edmonton comes around.",

And the lamb empanadas were smoky with chorizo and roasted tomatoes. Adam said they were everything you wanted from Hot Pockets but never got, and he was right.

Yet, he never approached our table. I would hate to think that as the only Black patrons in the building that night that it was race related. When we asked to speak to a manager, the manager looked at us and never approached our table. \n\nThis establishment refused to serve us after waiting for several minutes with no service.

  "text": "I'm a little torn with this review! The food overall was pretty tasting but the portion size was pretty small for the price. I got avocado toast, eggs benedict, and strawberry French toast. \n\nThe eggs benedict were the best. Eggs perfect consistency, although the Hollandiase sauce started separating by the time I got home. I did have a 15 min drive and the food was probably sitting for a good 10mins before I picked up too. \n\nThe avocado toast was 1 piece of toast, with a really meager smear of avocado(like the amount that you would spread for butter on toast). The turkey bacon and egg was good. But that was it. A little lacking for the price that you pay for it. \n\nThe strawberry French toast cost $1.50 more than the regular French toast but all I got was some sliced strawberries. She had asked if I wanted fresh strawberries or the strawberry sauce, so I knew what I was getting for the fresh strawberries but I thought there would be more pizazz. On the bright side, the French toast was yummy.",

  "text": "Fish is a hard sell in Alberta.  Pride in Alberta beef (mediocre in my opinion) and distance from the coast play a part in neglecting this healthy protein option.  When I received a great coupon for this particular Joey's, I was reminded that we do like our fish in this house.  We intended to go there with another couple but sickness meant that we were only two that Saturday.\n\nIf location is everything, Joey's is at a disadvantage.  It's hard to see from the street - I recommend using a GPS to locate.  The entrance is also difficult to access because of a concrete walled patio (useless on a cold winter night.  Once inside, the restaurant is roomy, well-lit with a large screen TV on the north wall for those addicted to Hockey Night in Canada.  The staff are friendly and service is initially quick.  My only quibble with the service is that I had to go to the kitchen to ask for coffee and dessert when we were finished our mains.  We never know how we feel about dessert until we finish the first course.  However, the owner served coffee/tea and dessert as well as took our payment.  The waiting staff seemed to be busy with cleaning up, which made us fell slightly rushed.\n\nHow was the food you ask?  My wife had the halibut with mashed potatoes, pronouncing the mash great but the halibut too dry.  I must take her word for it because I learned to dislike mashed because that was the only way my father wanted potatoes served and because I ordered the endless shrimp plate.  I was full with the single serving so I couldn't sample my wife's halibut (which disappeared despite the bad review) or eat any more shrimp.  For dessert, we shared the mud pie, delicious.\n\nThe coupon worked because we plan another visit some time in the future.",

  "text": "Not one to write reviews but this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Service and food were terrible. We were sat quickly on the rooftop tonight which was nice. We were sat a table with no salt and pepper or silverware just menus.. okay.. so my boyfriend and I start browsing the menu and pick drinks and our food since no one came up to us for 10 minutes. Our waiter comes by with water and drops a drink menu then runs away. Awesome. Wait another 10 minutes and he finally comes back. My boyfriend orders a beer they didn't have which was fine so he got something different. I ordered a lemonade and they were out of it so I ordered a root beer instead and what do you know they're out of that too. No big deal I just got a coke. We order our food and wait for our drinks. 5 minutes goes by, no drinks but our appetizer of calamari came out quickly and the food runner just drops it. Mind you we still have no plates or silverware but we eat it anyway. Calamari was super plain the menu said it came with stuff on it and it literally came with nothing but marinara. Then our food comes out. I got a ny strip steak and my boyfriend got a pineapple chicken sandwich. When I say Applebee's could of made better food I'm not kidding. I had to go up to the server who was completely non existent this whole time and ask for salt and pepper after the hostess finally brought silverware. Not once did he ask if we needed anything or how anything was. If we wanted another drink. Nothing. I waitress for a living and could see it was busy but that's literally no excuse for how horrible the service was. Both the tables next to us were complaining that he wasn't acknowledging them at all. Only positive was the food coming out quickly but it wasn't even good at all. Definitely will never be back a waste of 65 dollars.",

  "text": "I know that I do not need to give any review for this chain restaurant, because I have never wanted to go here anyway. However, we decided to go to this place with my in-laws because we thought it could please everyone (adults and children) and it was one of the few family style restaurants in the West side of town. We have been avoiding dining at Olive Garden for at least 7 years, and now I know we should have gone to another Italian restaurant. \n\nTheir menu is quite extensive and very similar to other Italian restaurants, such as calamari, pizza, spaghetti, salad, chicken or pork scaloppini etc. Everything sounded good in the menu and the pictures looked very enticing.  However, nothing tasted right, and in almost all of their entrees, they have added cheese to their dishes which means extra creamy and FAT. YUCK! Their  kids cheese pizza did not taste good either. The only thing that is fresh is their Garden Salad. The service is good. The price is not cheap for the quality of their food. \n\nWe will cross out Olive Garden from the list...FOREVER.",

  "text": "Suppa had one of the more interesting offerings for Restaurant Week, which is why my wife and I found here on a Friday evening in August 2015. The restaurant had seating outside and being a nice evening, we preferred that option.\n\nLooking through the menu, we decided that one of us would go for the Restaurant week offering while the other of us would order ala carte from the menu. It was nice to have that option and I think not all restaurants have that option when a RW is in progress. The RW menu we chose consisted of crab fritters, mac n' cheese, ricotta cavatelli, and choice of a dessert item. It was nice of them to also include a beverage in the offering. From the ala carte menu, we went for the duck poutine and the cubano melt sandwich. \n\nThe first comment is that the food took a long time to come out. The restaurant was quite busy on a Friday evening and we could only see one server doing the rounds. The first dish to come out were the crab fritters. They were crispy and hot but as my wife puts it, there did not seem to be any crab meat in it. I thought I had found some traces of crab when I first took a bite but I could certainly see what my wife was saying. The next two dishes to come out were the mac n' cheese and the duck poutine. Both dishes were tasty and as the poutine is not something I have often had before, I enjoyed the novelty of the dish. What surprised us were the huge portions. Even though I was very hungry, I decided to not finish all of my duck poutine and leave some room for the other things we had ordered. The cubano melt sandwich was also very nice. The bread was well toasted and the ham, pulled pork and cheese all went nicely together. The cavatelli pasta was quite flavorful too. Finally, when it came to the dessert, we were so full, we just had a cupcake to go and had it at home. \n\nPositives:\n1. Interesting and eclectic menu.\n2. Huge portions - I could have a full lunch based on what was leftover from the meal and even then there were some leftovers.\n3. Reasonable prices - For what was being served, prices were reasonable.\n\nNegatives:\n1. Pretty slow service: We got in at around 9:20 p.m. and left at around 11 p.m. Certainly we were enjoying the evening and lingered on but then a part of the delay can be explained by how long it took for things to come out.\n2. Waters were not refiled promptly. In one instance, my wife requested a glass of water and the waiter, absent-mindedly perhaps, just left her with a glass full of ice. It wasn't until another 5 mins. or so after we could hail the waiter that we were able to have our glasses filled.\n\nOverall, this is the kind of place I would be very excited to have in my neighborhood. I wouldn't have the hassle of having to drive and search for parking and that would make it easy for me just to swing by for perhaps a sandwich or maybe one of their brunch items over the weekend. It is certainly a place I would like to return to.",

The hollandaise sauce was disgusting, not even sure it was hollandaise sauce more like white cream poured over the eggs.  The eggs were the size of quarters, not kidding and didn't even think they could be that tiny....The english muffin was soggy and the potatoes were hard and bland..all in all a pretty poor experience. \n\nThe Good:\nService - A\nI spoke with the manager regarding the my situation and he was more than understanding and accommodating.  The waitstaff is very nice and out going.  \n\nFuture:\nWith at least 5 different spots in the area that have fantastic breakfast options, this restaurant will have to do much better to survive...As this is there 2nd day opening i am going to return in a few weeks to try the food again.....with that being said i am giving this diner a generous 2 out 5 until i try the food again.",

It was my first time trying dark mole sauce, and it wasn't my favorite mix of flavors but I appreciated the dish nonetheless. My fiancé's flautas were delicious with fresh salad and guacamole. \n\nDespite being busy, our service was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. At the end, there was a small mix up with our check, but it was handled quickly and very professionally. The staff was apologetic even though we weren't even upset.

Once seated, I was immediately provided complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa tasted fresh and had very good flavor. I ordered the Mexican Mule (their version of a Moscow Mule) which was absolutely delicious . It cost $13 but it was extremely big. \n\nFor lunch I ordered the trio of tacos; chicken, asada and carnitas. All 3 needed some sort of sauce or crema. The chicken was extremely dry. The asada had very good flavor and was my favorite of the 3. The carnitas was average. I felt the tacos could have all been topped/dressed differently but instead they all were the same but for the protein. \n\nAll in all, the place is nice, clean and close to downtown st Pete. I give it a 3 not because it's \"bad\" but because I simply think it's average/good. Certainly not the best Mexican food you will have;\nNot even the best in st Pete.

Little care is taken with the garlic spinach not to overpower the dish. \n\nThe steak offerings have been the same for too long, and technique has suffered. My husband loves the Cowboy ribeye so when I stopped by for a solo cocktail, I got one \"to go\" to surprise him. There were grill marks on one side and gray nothingness on the other. This steak had not seen a broiler at all. I thought perhaps they cook it differently for take out. I inquired on my next visit and was assured it was supposed to be exactly the same. I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium steak. Premium price when I could have gotten a better sear at home in my cast iron pan? No thanks. While this is just one example, we have been unimpressed with the food and outdated menu for some time. Dry aged or grass fed beef? Nowhere to be found. I can now get prime beef at BJs.

  "text": "As a Filipino living in Nashville, you can just imagine how excited I was to hear about this place so we just had to try it!\n\nCame tonight during their happy hour from 4-6. Mannnn were they packed! Nashville is definitely excited to try this restaurant out as they should!\n\nSitting right in the heart of the gulch, right across Sambuca, the restaurant is beautiful inside. It's big and it can hold big parties. I even saw a segregated room which hopefully you can reserve for private dinner.\n\nWe sat at the bar and had their happy hour cocktails. Delicious! But I do want to talk about food so let's get to it.\n\nPORK ADOBO FRIED RICE: this is the BEST thing that I've had just yet. It is honestly perfect and just right. Bartender even told me that this is the most underrated dish they have- people never order it. But he said it's what he always get at the end of his shift. It is DELICIOUS! GET IT!!!!!!\n\nSISIG:. Traditionally made with left overs from a pig's face - this is a traditional bar food in the Philippines. Don't worry! They only serve it with pork belly! It was my favorite from everything we've ordered. \nUpdate- it was really good the first time we had it. The 2nd time, I wish it was a little crispier.\n\nLUMPIA: traditional egg rolls. You know, I'm a little biased because I've had so many lumpia growing up. I've had better but my husband thought it was good.\n\nBAO: I had their pork belly bao. Really delicious! The bun is on point and that's always the hardest to make. \n\nCHICKEN INASAL: decent. Not bad. I didn't think it was amazing but I didn't think it was bad either.\n\nSUNDA SUNDAE: dessert and it's their take on the traditional Halo-Halo dessert. You should try it! Also Halo-Halo literally translate to Mix-Mix so when you order this, take a picture, then mix it all together. You have to mix it until the Ube ice cream is completely melted. Trust me!\n\nRIDICULOUS: this was pretty good. It's basically ice cream wrapped with cake. I thought it was just ok. \n\nService Was good, too! It was their first week so one of the items that we ordered didn't arrive so our bartender gave us our dessert for free. I thought that was really nice. Shoutout to them!\n\nParking- there is another parking garage across Bar Louis and it's really cheap parking. There's also a parking garage literally right next to it in the same building so don't worry about that!\n\n\nOverall, I'm so glad we tried this place and I'm so glad they decided to open a restaurant in Nashville!",

But today after brunch, we brought home a cinnamon roll for my daughter who couldn't come along with us. I snuck a bite and THERE WAS A BUTTON in the dough! \n\nWe called the restaurant and after being put on hold for a good amount of time, the acting manager came on the line and was less than sympathetic. His response to the situation was super awkward and borderline rude. He noted that the chef was wearing the same coat as he was yesterday when making the rolls and no button was missing (ok, ew - why no clean coat?!) but that they'd \"look into it\" and someone would call me tomorrow. (I had to ask him if he needed my phone number to call me back so not sure about the sincerity of that statement. )\n\nWe were polite and definitely are not looking for a handout, freebie, etc., just thought the restaurant should know that a customer bit into a button. Why not just take responsibility and apologize? Super disappointed with the way the situation was handled, and now feeling like the kitchen is less clean/sanitary than we thought. Thumbs down, Fork. Photo of button for the manager who seemed to believe that a lost button in the cinnamon roll was impossible.",

Both tasted okay.\n\nWe got deviled eggs, boom boom shrimp and tap smoked cheesesteak. \n\nDeviled eggs were okay, a little too mustardy for my taste.  Has a hint of sweetness,  like caramelized onions.\n\nboom boom shrimp were just okay.  It had a lot, and I  mean a lot more cauliflower than the shrimp.  It should be called boom boom cauliflower with shrimp.\n\ntap smoked cheesesteak was great.  It was the best item out of what I got. \n\nTry it out if you're in the area!",

She recommended an appetizer that was very thin like pita bread almost paperthin and it had a very fresh pico de Gallo on top with cilantro onions tomatoes and a sauce that we really liked. I ordered the chicken tiki masala. I'm not an expert on it but it tasted very good. My wife is vegan and they really bent over backwards to make some dishes for her. She didn't care too much for one dish but I liked it. The other Dish she did like it I wish I could remember the name but if you are vegan just let them know and they will make some suggestions or modify a dish for you.

  "text": "In spite of many hipster references on Yelp to this business, I ventured to it late on a weekend night on a simple quest for good pizza.\n\nThat actually reminds me of one of my favorite hipster jokes: Why did the hipster burn his tongue on the slice of pizza? Because he wanted to eat it before it was cool.\n\nLee's pizza is tasty, made with care and the toppings you order on a custom pie are plentiful. And from what I saw while waiting for my pizza, the wings looked good as well. Those came out to a small group sitting near me at the bar that included a man who clearly needed some food in his stomach.\n\nIn my opinion, two people can easily fill themselves on this small size pizza while enjoying a drink or two to wash it down. \n\nThere are plenty of beer options, most of which are available in coolers appropriate for a small and older grocery store. There are a handful of craft beers on draft as well and apparently they do pour some wine too...or those wine bottles are just to hold big fake roses and throw people off.\n\nUnfortunately for people like me who drink \"crap on tap,\" as Mr. Dunderbak calls it, Lee's has none of that. Not even \"crappy crap\" in cans or bottles like PBR or The Champagne of Beers. Which is fine, I get it. They kindly offer Coke products for us old souls who do like French toast, but want the actual breakfast and not a huge brown bottle at an 8.8% ABV.\n\nObviously, they keep it real simple here: Pizza, wings, craft beer. Seems like they know what they're doing and the employees openly appreciate their customers.\n\nAs I finish this review, the Yelp survey questions below include \"Good for Dancing: Yes, No, Not Sure.\" I marked \"No\" because the only folks dancing here have had way too much of that French toast beer or ABV equivalent and not enough of their quality pizza.",

This would have been 5 stars except for the noise level (so loud we could barely hear ourselves think and were shouting to converse). We didn't have drinks so I can't comment on those. Our food was really delicious though and I give all of what we ordered a thumbs up. One person in our party had the mussels and almost licked the bowl. Another person had the fish tacos (celiac so it was nice for her to have a full gf option) and I had the salmon poke (dairy sensitivity so again, nice that they were so accommodating) and it was truly amazing. It sounded good and was not disappointing. We each only had an appetizer size portion, but honestly, that was perfect. What was served at other tables looked and smelled great as well. If you can sit outside (it was raining so that wasn't an option), I would think that's a good place. Enjoy!",

The only spice i could taste in both mine and my wife's dish was salt or msg.  And lots of it.  More spices are definitely needed for Mexican style food.  The fajitas were bland, and the bacon wrapped shrimp tasted like they used Hormel pre-cooked microwavable bacon. I have seriously had better bacon at McDonalds.  The rice was as unflavorful as the rest of the meal, and even the guacamole, their namesake, tasted like it came from a can.    There are way too many superior Mexican restaurants in the area at a much cheaper cost for me to consider returning.  I would even consider Chipotle a superior restaurant.  Guac is one step above Taco Bell, but charges super premium prices.",

They consistently create delicious beers, and their prices for growlers are still reasonable (unlike several other popular local breweries). I've been asking them to make the Truckee River Red a Flagship brew ever since I discovered it; when I bring it home, even people who don't prefer beer tend to like it. It's truly a wine lover's beer. My favorite beer at Great Basin is the seasonal Red Nose Holiday Wassail, which is available during the holiday season. If you like holiday spices in your beer, you will love it!",

  "text": "My first experience with Japanese food done fast food style will likely be my last.  I guess overall, I just really expected it to at least taste good - even if it wasn't AUTHENTIC Japanese cuisine.  Unfortunately, I was pretty much feeling indifferent toward the dish and a little pissed at my newly, much-lightened wallet.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Chicken platter (not spicy at all, just like the no-personality cashier said).  You do get a LOT of food.  I also threw in an order of Vegetable Spring Rolls (those actually were delicious, but they're pretty hard to screw up!)   I guess I should start out by saying I'm not a sushi lover.  I'll nibble on it every once in awhile, but I just haven't ever really gotten into it.  I can tell this place probably prides itself on its sushi, but the entire place smelled so unappetizingly fishy, I can't imagine that even the most avid sushi lover would have enjoyed it.\n\nThe Sumi & Corn/Bowtie Salads that I chose for sides literally made me say \"Meh\" outloud and the vegtable skewer mostly got in my way while I was trying to eat the chicken.\n\nAll together (with an iced tea) it came to over 14 dollars for just me to eat.  Kind of ridiculous when you're eating something that pretty much tastes like it came from a mall food court.\n\nOverall, if you're feeling some Japanese or sushi and you happen to be near a SanSai, stop in, get some spring rolls to hold you over, and then make reservations at a better place for dinner at close to the same price.",

  "text": "I must say that having traveled in China, Hong Kong, and major cities in the world including NYC, where there are alot of Chinese people and Chinese restaurants, Fushia Asian Bistro does a very nice job.  The service is always very nice and helpful and the food is the real Szechuan spice!  I come here for my Szechuan fix that I need every other week.  Although the dishes can be extremely spicy hot, that is what Szechuan food is supposed to be.  One can order other less spicy dishes as well.   \n\nMy main criticism is that the menu is too long with too many items that it is a bit confusing and hard to nuddle through.  Also, they need menus to go.  Otherwise, I really like this place and when you walk in and see all the foreign born Chinese people there with their families and friends, you know that it is the real deal.  \n\nI love the fact that they have brown rice and beer, wine, and sake!  I wish more people knew about this place because it is tucked away on Amberly in New Tampa and a treat to have!",

  "text": "Our visit: This was our first visit. We visited on a Saturday at 7:30pm. \n\nThe reservation: The hostesses had a few mess ups with us. There were two working the hostess stand. The older woman (post 50) who is vivacious and energetic answered the phone the first time we called and pretended the restaurant was very unavailable. I called at 6pm asked for the first available table for the night for 2. She said they were avail at 8:15pm. I asked if there was anything earlier and she said maybe 8pm and eventually quoted 7:30pm as if she was doing us a big favor for a party of 2. After grappling with the consideration of waiting an hour for the table, I called again. This time the younger hostess answered the phone. She said there was no wait. LOL. So we arrived and there was no wait. ..........\n\nThe strawberry feta salad: amazing!!!! I devoured that salad. \n\nChicken parm: I didn't eat the chicken because the pasta was so good, but the pasta was amazing. \n\nThe lava cake: this is not a lava cake. It is a brownie that has not been cooked all the way through. I didn't eat much of it. \n\nThe service: now, despite all the flubs, this is why I can not in good conscience give less than four stars. Our server, Maria, was wonderful!! She was calm, collected, knowledge, and delightful. We later learned she's worked there for eight plus years. We briefly interacted with a young food runner with a bad attitude. She was 25-35 in age, thinning blonde hair in a ponytail, slender, corse in demeanor and a tad condescending. I held my tongue and was exceedingly polite to her to counter her condemnation and my usually obtuse husband actually noticed her rudeness and commented after she left the table. I later needed my waitress mostly because the foodrunner kind of left without saying anything-- haha I assume she's a food running because why else would she behave that way. I noticed another server, Kevin, walk by and asked him if he could get our waitress. He responded by saying that he could help us. And we learned from him that our server, Maria, is his wife and they met at this restaurant and have been working there for eight years. They were both so calm and courteous. Next time I return, I'll be sure to request that one of them take care of us on the off chance that the food runner is actually a server and she is our waitress next time. \n\nThe ambiance: sit down. There is a coat rack near the booths and it's a full service restaurant with evening lighting.",

Then another 15 minutes to get a menu. Mind you it was a Tuesday night and they were not busy at all! Maybe I should sit in the middle of the bar as opposed to the side but regardless, patrons should never have to wait that long to be served... Or acknowledged. For my second visit, I decided to take my sister and her husband to dine in. We were seated right away. Awesome. We were offered bread! Hell yes we want bread! You would think the bread would come right away but it didn't. It actually came out with our appetizers.... No big deal though. Our main courses also came shortly after. I can continue to complain about the service but it really wasn't completely terrible. \n\nOverall, I think the place is amazing! I am also obsessed with the interior design... I seriously could live there! \n\nSo let's talk food. Everything I had was amazing! I ordered the duck and my sister and her hubby ordered the steak sampler to share. We also ordered brussels, mushrooms, butternut squash,  foie gras and bone marrow to share. Out of all the appetizers, I enjoyed the foie gras and marrow the most... but everything was just delicious! If you're a big meat eater, I suggest ordering the steak sampler! Worth the money! For my next visit, I'm going to go for the cheese cart and some dessert!\n\nThis is not only a great place for locals to dine, but a place tourists or guests at the Logan Hotel can appreciate. \n\nCan't wait to go back!",

  "text": "Three Sixty is a great place for drinks and appetizers with spectacular views and good ambiance. I've been there about a dozen times. I've used valet every time. The reason for my negative review, however, is that on my last visit, the valet driver damaged by vehicle and did not say anything to me. It wasn't as if they didn't know they did it - they hit the frame directly and hard. And my vehicle which is only a few months old stays parked in my garage all day every day. I wash it twice a week. I know exactly when the damage happened. I called the hotel and asked for the valet manager. Someone took a written message yet no response was received from the valet manager. I called again, asking for the valet manager, and had to leave a voice mail. Again, no response was received. That's poor business etiquette and shows apathy towards a good customer. The reputation of Three Sixty is highly tarnished in my mind. The date of the incident was April 3, 2013.\n\n\nUpdate, July 2013:\n\nAfter posting this, the valet manager did call me and they rectified the situation completely. Today will be the first time I've visited Three Sixty since the incident.",

It was super cold and I asked for a hot drink with something fun in it, she said let me check with the bartender. I heard her ask and then they gave her a hard time with recommendations. She never came back with suggestions on what we could order for drinks. Then she disappeared for at least 15 min. No one came over during that time. We were just about to leave when finally the bartender came out to ask us what we wanted. Really?! We already told the girl and you were the one giving her lip. It was so cold outside and we really wanted to warm up so we just ordered two coffees and a shot of Kailua, $17!? Another 10 min later our drinks came. We wanted to eat but after how long the drinks took we decided coffee was it. Unbelievable poor service. We're on our way to K-Paul's for lunch instead. Management should be ashamed of that kind of service.",

  "text": "If you're looking for good Mexican food, Sweet Taco is NOT the place.  I tried the pork taco and a brisket taco, both were flavorless and bland.  My dining partner tried the nachos, and they were a sorry affair with hardly any toppings and big chunks of lettuce, again, very bland.  The salsa (and I'm being generous calling it salsa) was incredibly bad, flavorless, and an odd color - almost tan.  Worst salsa ever.  Salsa is not difficult to make, so I can't image why they can't even pull a decent salsa together.  The chips served with the awful salsa were thin and crisp, and unfortunately, the best item they offered.  The guacamole had huge chunks of avacado in it and was passable, at best.  Our meals were so bad that we didn't even want to try the donuts, fearing it would be more of the same.  If you didn't like Taqueria Del Sol, you won't like Sweet Taco - all they did was change the name and add a few menu items.  Also, there are several bottles of hot sauce on each table.  I did not use any because the tops of the bottles were so crusted and sticky that it was unappetizing.  I guess they do not notice or do not care enough to clean the bottle tops occasionally.  I ate here once when it was Taqueria Del Sol, and I swore I'd never go back, well, they changed their name and fooled me a second time, but never again!",

I must say, they have some of the best priced big dishes in town. $10.99 for 3 eggs Benedict and a heaping pile of what could have been delicious potatoes.

Since I can't, I rounded up to 4.00/5.00 for the delicious wine and great atmosphere.\n\nOn my visit to Nashville, a friend who has lived in Nashville for 3 years suggested going to Rumours. It is labeled a Wine Bar for a reason - the waitress recommended a medium body French Pinot Noir that was easy to drink and did not break the bank. The wine went down like water, resulting in splitting two bottles between two people.\n\nWe paired the wine with the cheese plate, the meatballs, & the mussel bowl with spaghetti. The cheese plate came with four wedges of cheese, including a delicious goat cheese, tomato marmalade, nuts, and an array of bread and crackers. I enjoyed all of the cheeses, except the Dijon, and would recommend asking to substitute this cheese for an additional goat cheese or the server's suggestion.\n\nThe mussel bowl came fresh to order in a white wine & capers sauce topped with feta cheese. I will most definitely order this plate on my next visit to Rumours and highly recommend it to any guest.\n\nLastly, the meatballs were tasty but tiny. I expected the serving size of 4 meatballs as it was on under the small plates section on the menu. I was surprised that the 4 meatballs were roughly 1 inch in diameter. Still, the carrot-apple-fennel slaw complement the dish perfectly. At $8 a plate, I would suggest a try if you like meatballs but recommend ordering at least 2 for tables of more than 2 people.\n\nTwo bottles and a few small plates later, we stumbled out vowing to revisit the next time that I visit. I hope to go back when the weather is a nicer to sit in the gorgeous outside area.",

  "text": "When I tell people in Philadelphia that I'm Greek-American, invariably one of the first questions I'll get is \"What's your favorite Greek restaurant in Philly?\" which is quickly followed by \"What do you think of South Street Souvlaki?\" I have always been at a loss to answer either because I don't eat out often, and when I do it's almost never at a Greek restaurant. Also, as a vegetarian, I just wouldn't go to a restaurant whose name celebrates meat. \n\nSo when my friend Brad mentioned that he'd heard about a new Greek restaurant and would I check it out with him, I was immediately interested. From the initial reviews it sounded legit, more like the food I'd grown up eating at home rather than Greek food catering to American tastes (the many complaints about the lack of lettuce in the Greek salad were a good sign). The menu does still lean more towards the preferences of meat-eaters (gotta give the market what it wants) but there are several vegetarian options. No fish entrees, which seemed like a pretty major omission for a Greek restaurant, but the garidomakaronada sounds like the shrimp Santorini I used to love, which isn't something you find often. \n\nBut anyway, for my first visit the seafood test was the xtopodi (grilled octopus). Because if a Greek restaurant can't do THAT well, it'll never be great. The verdict? It has potential, but I have to admit it's not the way I'm used to having Greek-style octopus. Usually it's cut into pieces (thus more thoroughly cooked), and here the tentacles were served pretty much intact. The flavors were right though, and maybe this is the way it's actually served in Greece? It's tasty so still worth getting, but it's a huge portion so you probably want to have at least 4 people in your party who love octopus if you're going to order this.\n\nI chose the spanakopita as an entree, and that was definitely excellent. The pita was clearly house-made (not ready-made phyllo-dough) and delicious, and the spinach filling was really well done. This definitely stacked up against plenty of the better homemade spanakopita I've had. Brad got the meat-eater's version, the kreatopita (which had chicken, pork and lamb). I've never seen that in a Greek home or restaurant before, so I'm guessing this was made, again, for American tastes. But it must work, because he liked it. Both dishes came with the horiatiki salad - yes, this is what Greek salad is supposed to be like!\n\nMoving beyond the menu, the decor reminded me a lot of the more minimalist Greek tavernas I've been to, though still with a good dose of Greek art and elements (wall tiles, prints, statuettes, etc.) I could heard traditional Greek music over the loudspeaker but the noise level mostly obscured it - the restaurant was PACKED. Lots of big parties, families, etc. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and the hosts and servers ran around frantically to make sure that was the case.\n\nSo I'm happy to now know a great Greek restaurant in Philly! Well, close enough - a Philly suburb. Since most of the Greeks I know seem to prefer the suburbs anyway, this actually makes sense. In the meantime, I still need to find a good Greek restaurant in the city itself (eventually).",

And believe me, devotees are hoping you just drive on by.  This place is another hidden gem.  Looks aside, TPK is serving up the best Thai this and that side of the Cumberland.

  "text": "I visited Comfort Food and Kitchenette last night for the first time and I am impressed!  It's very unassuming from the outside, located in a little shopping center in Morrisville, but don't pass this place by - it's delicious.  \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is vibrate and inviting.  We sat along the wall of the restaurant where they have a long bench with chairs on the opposite side.  The benches have lots of pillows, which makes sitting down and enjoying your food a comfy experience.\n\nI ordered the eggplant parm stack with cashew cheese and my date ordered the falafel salad - both of them were great.  I am vegetarian, but my date is not, and even he got in on my vegan eggplant.   I definitely go back to Kitchenette and try more things on the menu, the blackboard specials are ever changing so I am excited to see what I get to try next.",

  "text": "Really, 3.5 stars because I didn't know how to do a 1/2 star. We tried to join another party, they were unable to accommodate us unless we ALL moved to another table so I moved to the bar. Interesting layout as they have a second ring of 4 toppers AROUND the central bar. We got our first waters within 5 minutes of sitting without asking. Within 3 more minutes, our waitress appeared for drink and appetizer orders. Got our wines, (Xplorador, Chile) my glass was dirty and the pour was below my normal expectation of a normal pour. Didn't say anything. Appetizers come next. Got the slab cut maple bacon and the \"famous for\" shrimp cocktail. OUTSTANDING!!! If Ur a bacon and spicy shrimp cocktail lover, you MUST get this. WARNING: shrimp cocktail is NOT inexpensive. Waitress returns to ask if I want another glass of wine. Yes, I'm running low at this point. I tell her about the dirty glass and the \"poor\" pour. She says she'll tell the bartender. Glass arrived poured about 3/4 FULL! Now, THAT'S what I meant by a good pour! Main dishes come. We got the St Elmo's Prime Rib sandwiches with house onion rings and cut fries. The onion rings came with a spicy ketchup/cocktail sauce-VERY good! The sandwiches were excellent.  The meat was super tender and tasty. U could easily bite thru the meat after dipping in the au jus sauce. I liked the creamy horseradish sauce better tho. I ask for the bill. No room left for dessert. $110.00 pre tip for 3 glasses of wine, two appetizers (shrimp cocktail $35.00 alone) and 2 entrees. The servers were all attentive, the food VERY good, but the price I thought a tad on the high side.",

They have a little stash of books, magazines, and kiddy toys hanging out by the side so you can occupy yourself with that nonsense whilst waiting. It makes the time fly while you wait. The beverages are good, good teas and coffees, and the have little impulse treats you can grab on the way out. It should also be noted that their customer service is exceptional.

  "text": "It was a rainy day. My family and I walked in and got seated immediately; we were table of 4. The server brought us a few waters to start. We ordered some appetizers to begin. The atmosphere was so quiet, I thought it was awkward. It was not at all packed, and I kind of wished they had more customers so there would be a more lively, dynamic atmosphere. I think the place overall was overpriced, but the appetizers were fairly priced. \n\nAppetizers: \nCoconut Shrimp\nMiso Soup\nAge Dashi Tofu\nThai Lemongrass Coconut Chicken Soup\n\nThe Coconut Shrimp was good and so was the miso soup. However, the Age Dashi Tofu was bland and the Thai Lemongrass Coconut Chicken Soup was not the best. We then proceed to order sushi and our entrees. \n\nSushi: \nCrunchy Roll\nHello Kitty\nSexiest Man Roll\nPuff Daddy\n\nEntrees:\nSalmon Hibachi with sauteed vegetables and white rice\nSingapore Rice Vermicelli\n\nAs for the sushi, the crunchy roll was superb, and I really recommend it if you like a plain, yet delicious roll. The hello kitty roll was the size of a diagonally cut sandwich and it was hard to eat with the chopsticks. Actually, I didn't know how I was supposed to eat it! Besides that, it was enjoyable. The sexiest man roll was acceptable, and my sister liked the sauce that was drizzled on top of the sushi! The puff daddy was adequate and my sissy and I really like the crunchy stuff on top! \n\nThe Salmon Hibachi with sauteed vegetables and white rice was excellent. I highly recommend this dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The sauteed onions compliments the salmon. The sauteed vegetables was great. The Singapore Rice Vermicelli was also delicious and I recommend this dish as well. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for a special event, but for casual dinner or lunch I would rather go to another place.",

The taste on New Orleans is the best plate for undecided guests because it provides a pleasing sample of the jambalaya, gumbo, and crawfish étouffée. The best part of the meal was the French onion soup. By far the best French onion soup I've had and exemplifies how it should always taste!!! I don't think the soup gets enough hype as it deserves.

I've been anxiously awaiting a visit once they opened, and I wasn't disappointed.  I went with a friend and we opted to share a savory and sweet dish.  We got the buffalo chicken omelet and cinnamon roll.  The buffalo chicken wasn't what I would typically order, but it was scrumptious.  It basically tasted like the buffalo chicken dip you have at parties, but made with an egg and hot sauce.  Hello!  The cinnamon roll was large and perfectly soft in the center.  Yum yum yum.  I can't wait to go back and try more options.",

For under $15 I had enough food to tak home to eat for dinner. My husband had a rigatoni dish that was also amazing and large enough for leftovers. Our total bill was under $30. \n\nAnother reason to go near closing on Sunday - on our way out we were given 2 free loaves of fresh baked bread that would have gotten thrown away. Score!

Bar was moderately crowded but extremely loud for the amount of people. Drinks were mediocre at best. Sazerac was underwhelming and Moscow mules were some of the worst I've experienced in Nashville. For the price I'd expect them to be on par with Morton's or the Oak Bar. \n\nSat on time, but took longer than expected for waiter to approach table. After trying the pickles and bell peppers, the bread came which was delicious. We decided on the smoked salmon and bacon as an appetizer. I must say the bacon may have been the highlight of the meal. It was deliciously prepared with a great sauce. Salads arrived and contained surprising delicious tomatoes, especially for the time of year. Going into the entree I had high expectations. However  my ribeye, although prepared fantastically visually (medium rare) lacked the flavor I typically expect from the cut of meat. My wife ordered the shrimp pasta which even though the shrimp was cooked well, lacked flavor. The best part of the meal was probably the skillet fried potatoes and gravy... absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall not a bad experience, but for the price and ambiance I'd much rather go to one of the other steakhouses in Nashville. Definitely worth checking out, if for nothing else then to reaffirm your favorite restaurant.",

We went the first time about one week after they opened and I was annoyed at the prices. I thought everything was a bit too expensive for what you got. But over time I started to find items on the menu like their tamales and rice bowls that I really love. My husband loves their tacos and cucumber salad. He has loved them from day one, hence why we kept coming back. We also love their green salsa. We find the wait for a table usually too long, so we usually sit at the bar. Their drinks are all fresh juices. Everything about Bar Taco tastes very fresh. Eventually I got used to the prices vs food size and just enjoyed the food.

I don't go to No Libs often, but this is a spot I like to drink at when I'm in the area.  I feel that they are a little pricey, but I guess they can be because of lack of competition.  I think their happy hour could be a little better.  $1 off a draft isn't the best deal in the world, but they are my only complaints really.  If you're in Northern Liberties then this is the place to drink good beer.",

Everything was to-die for, especially the kale salad and the goat cheese and mushroom toast.  Normally, I am not a big goat cheese or kale guy, but every last bite was had here.\n\nHighly recommended! Great food and great service.",

He wanted to go to Seoul Kitchen, but after reading Isabella J's SK review, we decided to try Kimchi Time instead and we're so glad we did! \n\nThe tables were full at 8 pm, which is a testament to their popularity and solid food. The servers were very friendly, but not the most attentive. I did have to flag them a few times but they were especially responsive. \n\nWe ordered the mandu, spicy Korean wings, dolsot bi bam bap, and grilled gal bi - all dishes I highly recommend! They serve everything piping hot, maybe too hot. The wings weren't too spicy in my opinion (I can barely do hot cheetohs). I loved my sweet delicious gal bi. They also provide 5 sides including different kimchi vegetables and sweet mashed potatoes (I asked for extra).  Finish your meal with red bean ice cream and I guarantee you'll leave with a happy belly.",

  "text": "I love, love, love this place! I always try to stop by whenever we are in Philly, we actually came here a few times from NY just to have dinner here.  Did I mention that I love this place?  My ultimate goal is to try all of the dishes on the menu, which has been difficult as I always order the same 2-3 dishes each time.  See below for the dishes I have tried, which are ranked based on my preference:\n\nPrah-Hok Kateeh - My absolute favorite dish and I have to order it every time I come here.  It doesn't look much in pictures, but trust me, you will love it.  It is basically ground pork that is flavored to perfection and you eat it with an assortment of vegetables.  I can eat this dish everyday!  Actually Khmer Kitchen inspired me to try to replicate this dish at home, I have tried a bunch of different variations of this dish using recipes from the internet, and none have even come close to the ones served here.\n\nSah-Law Machue Yuin - Another dish that I always order. It is a sweet and sour soup that comes with either chicken, fish or shrimp.  My personal favorite is the fish version.  Due to the fact that there are no Cambodian restaurants in NYC, I try to order a similar dish when I go to Vietnamese restaurants, but needless to say, none have come close to this dish.  I love the fresh pineapples (most other places use canned ones), and the gourd melon, which I have never had before I came here, now I love it!\n\nCha Throp - stir fried eggplant that comes with either pork or chicken.  I love the pork version, the pork just melts in your mouth.  The flavor could be similar to eggplant with garlic sauce from Chinese restaurants, but Khmer Kitchen uses big pieces of perfectly flavored pork instead of group pork, which I think makes a huge difference\n\nCha Mussels - The sauce for this dish is out of this world.  True story, my friend actually took the leftover sauce to go so that she can eat it over rice for lunch the next day, no mussels, just the sauce.  The mussels are great too, but the sauce this the star of this dish, and I kind of wish they serve bread with this dish so I can sop up that delicious heavenly sauce.\n\nPleah Sak-Koe- It is basically a rare beef salad.  For people who are a bit squeamish about eating rare beef, this is probably not the dish for you. For the more adventurous eaters, give this a chance.  It is super refreshing, particularly during the summer.  Could be a bit spicy, so be forewarned!\n\nSah-Law Machue Kr'ung - another soup with either chicken or beef.  I liked the aforementioned sweet and sour soup better, but this one has my favorite protein, i.e. beef.  The beef is super tender and flavorful.  I picked out all of the beef while everyone else was busy talking (no, that's not rude at all)\n\nKuh-Puh Ch'in - Shrimps that are lightly battered and fried to perfection.  I am not a huge fan of shrimp, but if I have to eat shrimp, I would eat this any day.\n\nCha La-Pauh - stir fried pumpkin with either chicken or pork.  I don't like pumpkin, but the pork in this dish is so yummy.  I had to be sneaky and pick out the pork as I did with the previously mentioned soup.  Everyone that liked pumpkins at the table raved about this dish.\n\nCha Kr'ung - stir fry dish with celery and pepper, comes with either chicken or beef.  It was just ok, nothing too spectacular to report.  \n\nCha Lok-Lak - my least favorite dish.  It is basically beef cubes on a bed of lettuce.  Perhaps I should've dipped the beef in the sauce longer, but it is not as flavorful as the rest of the menu.\n\nThis is a family restaurant with the mother and grandmother in the back cooking, and coming here feels like going home to mom's cooking, well if your mom is Cambodian and an amazing cook.  The waiter is super friendly, I assume he's the son/grandson to the chefs.  He's always very patient in answering whatever questions we have, and always accommodating with all of the annoying requests I have (i.e. more vegetables for the Prah-Hok Kateeh, more napkins, takeout containers for the leftover sauce).  The only downside is that the hours can be unpredictable, so definitely call beforehand.  I have been disappointed numerous times because they had to close early, or open late for various reasons, as I don't live in Philly, I couldn't wait around for them to open.  It has been a running joke between us that we are 'lucky' if the place is actually open when they say they would.  However, they have a loyal customer in me, I will come back here again and again!",

First trip I had the Smoked Salmon & Scrambled BLT it was $14 and it was only ok. I drank the free water on the table. There was a lot of bread and I ended up eating the sandwich open-faced. I wish I had gotten a juice or smoothie to try but after $14 on a sandwich that wasn't an option this time. My coworkers ordered other meal options but no one was blown away. It was just ok.\n\nOn my second trip I came for dinner with my family because my sister loves this place and I have to say it has improved since opening.

  "text": "I'm a native Nashvillian and library-enthusiast, so I've seen this place several times but had never been in. I came here for the first time with a friend during the Southern Festival of Books this past weekend. It was a Saturday afternoon, and we learned upon arrival that they were closing in another 10 minutes. We just wanted a piece of cake, which was already prepared and sitting in a glass case. As we were looking at the case deciding on which we wanted, we were stiffly informed \"We're Closed!\" by a gentleman who worked there and that we would not be able to order. Then he turned to the woman working the register (who was in the process of taking a man's order) and told her to continue helping that man, because \"he's a regular.\" He proceeded to point us toward the door and made it abundantly clear we weren't welcome even though it was 10'til. Unbelievable. With all the tourists that were in town this weekend for the home game & the book festival, I am baffled that someone would chance dirtying a visitor's experience in our city with that kind of nonsense.\n\nDespite how rude we felt this encounter was, I went back the next day to get my cake & a coffee-drink. Because, you know, cake is cake and I have needs. And I've got to tell you, the customer service was lackluster and the cake was at best mediocre. The coffee was so thick and sweet I threw more than half of it away. My boyfriend got a panini, and that was really good, but still--definitely not worth patronizing this business after how I've seen they treat their customers. I work in corporate retail, so maybe I'm overly sensitive to these things, but I very firmly believe that there is absolutely NO excuse whatsoever for poor customer service. And that is definitely what's happening here.\n\nAnyway, the second star is for the panini. Good thing they have \"regulars,\" otherwise, I don't know how they'd stay in business.",

I could have licked the bowl but my family would never have gone out to eat with me again. I got the chicken gyro platter... Loved it... it was so much food. It comes with fries and a Greek salad.

The salmon was very good and she ate every bite of it! My nephew ordered the  cheeseburger and Greek fries and he was as satisfied as a teenage boy with a phone and a burger would tell me but there wasn't anything left on his plate   The waitress came through and put on the music and danced threw napkins up in the air and all over us yelling  OPA and dancing around the room celebrating my daughter. They threw plates into a aluminum bucket  braking them in Greek tradition yelling  OPA and clapping! And dancing! It was great fun and such a sweet surprise for my daughter. We will be back!

  "text": "I am a regular at Zizzo's, because it has the best brewed coffee in town. I probably go at least 1-2 a week just for a 24oz large coffee for 2.50!! A delicious cup of coffee (or technically three) at this price is unbeatable.\n\nI'm definitely a coffee snob and I care deeply about the roasting. My husband is from Seattle and my mother travels quite often to Colombia. Zizzo's is my favorite because they always have a light roast, medium roast, and dark roast coffee of the day to chose from. \n\nLet's talk about light roast. I have a deep appreciation for light roast coffee for a couple of reasons. First, it has the highest caffeine content. Second, it's hard to do light roast that has a good prominent flavor. All of Zizzo's light roast coffees are amazing. I personally love the Mexican Altura and the Guatemala Antigua roasts.\n\nThe medium roast is the Santa Barbara blend and it's great too. A solid go-to. I'll occasionally get a dark roast, and have never been disappointed. Occasionally they have a Tanzania peaberry, and I can never pass that up.\n\nTheir food is okay(but delicious at their other location), the clientele are friendly, they love dogs, and I've never ever had bad service. Tammy is my favorite barista, she seems genuinely happy! \n\nThis was all about the brewed coffee, but their espresso drinks are also really good. I like the Mexican mocha the best. I don't recommend the biscotti, but the other baked goods are fine.\n\nThey also give my pup a dog treat, and that makes me happy!  I also forgot to mention they have a few great beers on tap, and a fun system where locals buy each other beers in advance and Zizzo's puts their names on the wall and what someone has purchased for them.",

If you're from the Northeast it's always a challenge to find a great deli sandwich.\n\nPickles plus has the real thing, their corned beef and or pastrami sandwiches are lean, carved thin and piled high on freshly baked breads, pumpernickel, or rye. Great, spicy deli mustard. Everything's home made. I love their home made potato salad, unlike other area deli's whose condiments come in pre made manufactured tubs.\n\nFridays I make a special trip for their homemade New England clam chowder. Nice and creamy with lots of clams.\n\nPickles plus has one of the best Greek salads I've tasted, it's huge. Very courteous servers who go the extra mile to ensure you're satisfied.

  "text": "My fiancee and I do not got to Mexican restaurants a lot because all of them seem to have the same exact menu as the next. We heard about Guac through some friends of ours and decided to try it even though we thought that it was just another typical Mexican restaurant. Luckily for us Guac is so far from the typical Mexican restaurant. In my opinion, Guac puts other Mexican restaurants to shame.\n\nJust like all other Mexican restaurants, there are the typical items: Chimichangas, Burritos, etc. My fiancee ordered the Burrito and Salsa Verde, it was HUGE !! I didn't try it so I can't comment about the taste. I can however comment about my dinner, the Mariscada Ranchera. Amazing and delicious are the 2 only words that I can use to describe it. Filled with seafood that included: snow crab, squid, shrimp, scallops, octopus (didn't eat the octopus, I have my limitations) among other things in a spicy red sauce. It was delicious and very filling. Imagine Joes Crab Shack.....but Mexican style !! Make sure you ask for some extra napkins because you will need them for the snow crab legs !! \n\nIt is not overpriced at all.  My meal was $15.99 and my fiancee's was $8.99. For the 2 of us for dinner with a some queso and chips and 2 drinks, it was roughly $40. Not bad at all. Our server Jake was awesome and made sure our drinks were filled at al times and was really attentive to our needs. \n\nMake sure you give this place a chance. I see some negative comments on here but try to look past those and give Guac a shot. You will not be disappointed.\n\nThat's all I'm saying !!",

  "text": "I had long marveled at the fact that Franklin was such a black hole for good coffee.  Starbucks was everywhere, good coffee shops had shut down, and even the few place you could go were mediocre at the very, very best.  Downtown was especially bereft anything resembling good coffee.\n\nSo, I was driving down Bridge Street, and I see \"The Coffee House,\" and suddenly, I realized that hope abounds.  To be fair, I do know that recently another coffee shop has opened downtown, but I hadn't been able to get a coffee there, so I'll call \"The Bubbly Gorilla\" to maintain anonymity.  I actually had stepped into the Bubbly Gorilla, but the line to the counter was practically to the door, and I just didn't have time.  This is not the establishment's fault, and I will get around to it whenever I have an hour to invest in downtown Franklin\n\nWith all that said, I do enjoy The Coffee House very much.  I could see it as a casual relationship whenever I am in the area, say as a local buddy I visit if I have time.  I go to see it whenever I am in town, maybe get a cup of coffee, but The Coffee House will never be my serious coffee relationship: it's just too far from where I live.\n\nWhen I made my order, the fellow that I had was competent, thoughtful, and considerate.  I'll be the first to complain about brain-dead  teenagers at making my coffee, but my experience did not reflect this problem.\n\nIt has a nice comfortable layout.  Various rooms for various purposes.  The record room was a really nice touch.  It's literally a room where people can listen to old albums.  Other dining areas were nice too.\n\nI will echo those who complain that the counter area is not well deigned.  There's just room to maneuver around if someone is standing at the ordering area.  It's a serious flaw, and they should really figure out a better solution.  The also use Bongo Java coffee, which is tasty, but I can get it very easily elsewhere.  So many places use Bongo Coffee in Middle Tennessee that a coffee shop trying to distinguish itself should really go a different direction.  That's just my opinion, though, and The Coffee House does still makes it very tasty\n\nFranklin was desperate for good coffee options, and it looks as though they're doing a lot better.  I can't wait to try the Bubbly Gorilla, but I already know that if it is a disappointment, The Coffee House at Second and Bridge is a great place to visit.  Do not ignore this place if you're in Franklin and like coffee.",

That's how many servers passed me in the 7 minutes after being seated before one came to my table (of course, some of them were actually serving).  That put the experience off to a bad start, what with my low blood sugar and all. I was about to walk out, feeling snuffed and ignored, more so when the table next to me was immediately greeted upon seating.  \n\nWhen the server finally arrived to take my drink order, things began to look up. The Wisconsin Cheddar Bites arrived and were excellent!  Hot. Crispy. Tasty. Not quite worth the wait (because the wait was so long) but still delicious, with a tasty, chunky Marinara.  \n\nBut then another 23 minutes of waiting for my main course and then they got it wrong. Once they finally got it straight, the manager brought it out herself, IT WAS GOOD!  Tasty. Fresh. And Generous. The Baby Backs were fall-off-the-bone good (but still had the silver skin on) and the BBQ Chicken was done just right. Their Honey BBQ Sauce is very good, but you'll want to ask for extra. \n\nVicky, the Manager on Duty, checked on things and seemed to care, but still the Service left so much to be desired.

  "text": "We've been to the Blue Dog a few times, to both locations (in Chalfont and Lansdale) but as Lansdale had a beer we really wanted to try, we hit them up for some dinner.\n\nThe crowd was quite light, with several booths open so we made our way to one in the center of the restaurant and proceeded to take in the menus. The Blue Dog has a decent amount of pub food, but it's rather limited in variety. You won't find juicy burgers or the like on here -- the only burger I saw was on a pretzel roll. Also, no cheesesteaks (a Philly staple!!). The beer menu is pretty deceiving as well. You are handed this large menu with what looks to be about 40 craft beers on it and you think \"SCORE\" until you get to the point after the 11th beer and it says \"Coming Soon...\" *womp womp* and then there are arrows of ones coming soon pointing upwards. \n\nThe food was ok.  Not that it was bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  The French onion soup is perhaps the best I've ever had in awhile, but the sandwiches (I had the chicken italiano and he had the filet Panini) were loaded and soggy. There was no way you could eat it as a sandwich. I had multiple versions of fries on my plate, too (steak, regular, small .. very odd and inconsistent). I do have to say that our server was top notch and very helpful and attentive.  The dessert we had (homemade chocolate peanut butter pie) was probably the highlight of the evening. Very good but chunky (has nuts for those who aren't a fan).\n\nI believe the pub has a bunch of events throughout the week - we happened on Trivia night. I guess the locals enjoy it, I've been to better (Steppy's in E. Norriton on Wed.nights). The MC was a little too creepy for my taste and the questions weren't really trivia relatable - just stupid knowledge.\n\nAs for the take-out area, they have a lot of decent beers, many locals that are bottled. If you drink those in-house, it's a $2.50 upcharge per bottle.  You can also try Capone's in E. Norriton for some really great brews as well and I don't believe they have an upcharge for drinking in the restaurant.",

One table with about 10 people, and the other with about 18. Experience (as a patron and working at restaurants) tells me that, other than the obvious noise, food quality drops drastically when that happens as cooks struggle to get all the food out for that table at the same time, and other orders are either rushed through, or die in the window as they are ignored being the mountain of plates for the party. This is a good test of a kitchen, but let's keep an open mind. \n\nOur waitress Tiffany was very nice, friendly and helpful. She said she would put our order in before party which she did. Very nice. \nWe ordered the Texas cheese fries, and the grown up grilled cheese. I usually have the Monte Cristo but wanted to try something new. Had a Caesar salad for my side. \n\nWe ordered before the big party so our food got out fast. \nThe Texas cheese fries were great as expected. No complaints there. \nThe grilled cheese had roast beef in it, which tasted very bland and over cooked. The worst part was the cheese. It was sliced cheese which was by far not high end to say the least. \n\nCaesar salad was fine. Not bad, not great. \nThe croissant on salad was awesome and sadly the best part of the meal. \n\nNot sure we will return.

I love it!  Traildust Town is unique and quaint and simply fun.  If it's not too hot, or if the misters are going, sit on the patio and enjoy the periodic gun fire from Pinacle Peak.\n\nEnjoy the apricot tea!  It is amazing!\n\nThe staff has always been kind and attentive and knowledgeable.  I've never had to wait for a table, but it's never seemed deserted either.\n\nThe food is decent.  If the food were spectacular, I would give it 5 stars, but it is simply decent.  It always seems fresh and healthy, but there's just nothing special about it.\n\nTo conclude, please dine at Dakota, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

Their dinner menu seems interesting, so I will come back soon.\n\nThe Libertine is located with all the other lunch options in Clayton, while being much less crowded (no wait, not noisy at all) and fairly priced. Nice decoration, interesting and bold menu.\n\nRamen: Having visited many ramen bars in both Japan and China, this is not a typical bowl of ramen... With that said, it's good. The pork belly (bacon) was excellently grilled, and the soup has the right touch of shiitake mushrooms. The noodle is less than authentic but ok.  It, however, lacks the hearty and casual feeling the ramen is entitled to offer. Dining with the Clayton crowd also makes you unwilling to take up the bowl and drink the soup, which is what you SHOULD do when you eat ramen.\n\nMy friend loved his burger. Will come back for lunch, good place for business lunch.",

  "text": "Overall Value:  Super crispy, juicy chicken at a reasonable price.  Far superior to Bon Chon and most other Korean Fried Chicken that I have had.  And they have a fairly large menu -  we will definitely come back to try some of the other items (and get more KFC, duh).  \n\nThe Food: We got the half chicken Korean fried chicken ($12.95), which you can get in two flavors - we got honey soy super spicy and sweet chili spicy.  We also got a tuna taco ($5.25), which they were nice enough to cut in half, they through in a free crunch ball (normally $2.75) because it was our first time visiting, and we got a medium matcha green bubble tea ($3.50).  The chicken was SUPER crispy and still very moist inside - it was phenomenal.  This was especially impressive because the half chicken isn't just wings or drumsticks - it's a half chicken that is cut into smaller pieces, so you are getting pieces of chicken breast too.  But these pieces were still impressively moist and flavorful as well (and I usually much prefer dark meat).  The sauces were both good, but my only complaint is the spice level on the super spicy was kind of weak.  If you are going to call something super spicy, it needs to have a bigger kick.  \n\nThe tuna taco was also quite good and had a really fresh flavor with the guac, cilantro, salsa, sour cream etc. A minor quibble is that because there is so much else going on in the taco, it overpowers the tuna a bit, but still good a decent size (it better be for over $5!).  The crunch ball was awesome.  Again, SUPER crispy outside and delicious filling with kimchi and rice, covered in flavorful sauce.  Matcha green bubble tea was delicious as always.  \n\nWe skipped out on fries because we thought it would be too much for two, but probably should have added fries to the order.  Half chicken wasn't quite big enough for the two of us, even with the taco and crunch ball (we eat a lot though).  We will go back to try the Korean Oven Chicken when that is available (there was a sign that said coming soon), and also try some of their many other dishes. \n\nService:  So friendly and helpful.  On top of giving us a free crunch ball, they also were patient with us and gave great recommendations for the menu, and let us sample the sauces.   \n\nSpace and Pace: Fairly large interior with plenty of seating.  We came on a Friday night around 7:30pm and it wasn't too crowded - great spot to meet up with friends and get some awesome chicken.",

When she came back, she told us to sit at one of two clean tables. Another customer said that they were out of half of the stuff on the buffet.

I am a germaphobe when it comes to wearing bowling shoes and using balls that everyone and their brother has touched. \n\nIt was not my night to pick out our outing, so I was told we were going to Splitsville. After cursing myself for not overriding the decision, I armed myself with Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer and mentally prepared myself to go. \n\nThe business has disintegrated so much in Channelside that Splitsville is only open on Thursdays through Sundays. After psyching myself up to go bowling for the first time in years, I must admit I was a bit disappointed tonight that Splitsville was closed. \n\nI cannot blame Splitsville for only being open on select nights. After all, these Channelside businesses need to make some sort of profit. I only pray Jeff Vinik's bid gets approved by the end of this week so that there is some sort of revitalization of Channelside. \n\nWe plan on returning soon so I will need to stock up on my Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer and start mentally preparing myself again.

  "text": "My husband and I went there for the 2nd time last night.  First time I would have given 4 stars so we went back there last night.  We asked to be seated outside since it was such a beautiful night.  Very small patio area, but nice - had plenty of TVs and, like I said, beautiful night.  When we were seated an employee had to be asked to get up so we could sit at the open table.  (He was there smoking and watching the cards game).  The employee then went to a large table with only 2 people sitting there and asked if he could sit there - they said yes.  Throughout my meal I could see this was the employee hangout, not the nice patio seating I would have enjoyed.  Even our waiter would come out and first talk with the group of employees before coming over to help us.   There were even people (I assume were employees) that would enter the patio from the parking lot and start joking around with the now over flowing, standing room only, table of employees - the couple that was sitting there had now left.  There were three other tables on the patio that were slowly emptying.  This meant that now the diners from inside could now come out to the patio for a smoke break.  I understand that the diners on the patio could smoke, but was a little frustrated that now there was a stream of people coming out to just smoke while we were trying to enjoy our meal and drinks.  I don't have a problem with other people smoking if they were there on the patio with us enjoying their meal, but the place turned into a literal smoke break patio.  \nWe would have continued to stay and had drinks had it not been more of a \"smoke break\" area.  Even employees would come out on their break (assumedly) and have a cigarette.  We had gotten there around 8pm and left shortly after 9pm.  So, this also wasn't  really late.  Glad I did not have my children with me, because the employees also had mouths on them that would not have been appreciated if my children were with me.  Bottom line - if you are a smoker and don't have a problem with a ton of people smoking around you while eating?  Sit on the patio.  If you're not - stick with inside.\nFood?  Meh.  I ordered the pasta con broccoli without mushrooms.  Pasta was dry with absolutely no flavor.  Looked like it came out of a box.  There were maybe 5 pieces of broccoli in it.  And pasta still had a few pieces of mushrooms - glad I'm not allergic.  Visit before that I got the steak salad - salad was great, but basically had to pick all the steak out - fatty and tough.  For the price?  Not worth it.  Husband got the unsmoked fish sandwich both times and liked it.  Fries were soggy and had barely any on the plate.",

The outdoor patio right next to the rail were already slowly getting filled up with patrons. We were lucky to secure the last table right next to the rail. Our host was very nice and told us our server would be with us shortly.\n\nSure enough, our server popped in to get our drink orders. \n\nThe three of us shared a combination of things from the menu.\n\nWe ordered the Fried Clam with Tartar Sauce, She Crab Soup Bowl, Grouper Tamales, Super Cajun Grouper Sandwich with Fries (+$0.99 for fries to substitute chips), Tuna Poke Tacos.\n\nMy least favorite was probably the fried clams because of the inconsistency of batter to clam ratio. Some pieces were just pieces of batter. That being said, the clam pieces were delicious. \n\nThe grouper tamales were average. The grouper was delicious and so were the sauces they served with it: rojo and salsa verde. I didn't like the masa mixture. I thought it too thick and bland. \n\nThe she crab soup was delicious but super rich. I don't think I could have eaten the entire thing by myself so thankfully it was shared among the three of us. \n\nThe grouper sandwich was delicious and very flavorful. I wasn't a fan of the fries that came with the sandwich. They were cut way too fat and not crispy enough for my liking.\n\nMy tuna poke tacos were very flavorful. I really enjoyed the sweet thai chili sauce and cabbage slaw that was underneath the tacos. The fish was generously portioned. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered their Beer of the Month special which was $2.50 for a bottle of Banks Beer. He said the beer was watered down and not flavorful but considering the price, I wasn't surprised. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I can see why people love coming here. I loved sitting right next to the rail enjoying the oceanfront views.\n\nService was great. Our server got my tuna taco order wrong but was quick to fix the issue and apologize even though we ordered a lot so it's easily misunderstand as another dish on their menu.",

We had amazing service until Randy the lead waiter took over. He was way off for sure . Foreshadowing, he almost tipped over my wine glass. Thank goodness for Nick , he was amazing and made sure we had water and anything else we needed. Then captain Randy shows up. Don't most steak houses have you cut into your steak before you eat it? Well, that didn't happen here. Fast forward to dessert . When Randy asked what we would like for dessert, my daughter asked for the cookie cake, he left and came back and said well sorry. We ran out of That last night. Weird , don't you make your food fresh each day??? Ten minutes later, he says that he was mistaken , they DO have the cookie cake. Ok , so we get our dessert and have that and then we have been finished for quite sometime before Randy graces us with his presence again. When he does show up and all the dishes have been cleared, he reaches over and spills water all over my husband . No apologies. My daughter and I are handing him napkins and the awesome guy who brought us coffee and water helped get it all cleaned up. He is the one who actually apologized!!! We said. Well you didn't do it. Such a nice guy. Randy came back with our check though and still nothing mentioned about his crappy service. We were done by then. Way too many cool restaurants to go back to this one . Just no!",

It was the end of breakfast and they were all getting ready for lunch. The servers were at a table by the kitchen and all on their phones. They were looking at dresses as I past to go to the restroom.  I am a server and we are not even allowed to have our phones on us ( but we do and hide them) let alone on the floor for the customers to see. Ok on to the food. It was mediocre. I ordered the Benedict with biscuits sausage and gravy it said fried eggs instead of poached so I asked mine for scrambled. When it came the scrambled eggs look like it came out of the carton and not fluffy like real eggs and the taste was bland. I had to add hot sauce and pepper for some taste. The potatoes were good with the bbq sauce on it. The sausage was dry and my cousin did like like his always he said his was very dry..Not sure I will ever go back. If I do it would have to be a different location.",

I knew it'd been an old bank built in 1925. Today, this place may appear unassuming from the outside, but definitely has WOW factor once inside, the kind you just don't see anymore in newer buildings. The ceilings, the columns, the marble counters, the wrap-around staircases, the wrought iron, a beautiful dining mezzanine, the old vault, etc. etc. This place is a CLASSIC.\n\nWe order old-fashioneds everywhere we go. The ingredients the bartender used were simple and humble, but she made hands-down the BEST old-fashioned I'd ever had in Philly. So well-balanced between the whiskey, the bitters,  and the simple syrup. She finished it with a bit of fruit cocktail. Now I always ask if I can add fruit cocktail if I need to doctor up an old-fashioned. They always look at me like I'm nuts, but don't knock it till you've tried it, and guess they haven't been to Del Frisco's in Philly!\n\nThank you so much for the wonderful experience for my husband and me on that cold afternoon, with the mid-afternoon light filtering through those stories-high windows, and our drinks warming our bellies.",

Definitely favors more upscale without the huge premium generally associated with that.\n\nLong list of tequilas. Decent sized menu without being overwhelming. Plenty of outside seating. Amazing location. \n\nThe food was very good. I got the fajita quesadilla and I enjoyed it. My wife ordered the ahi tuna tostadas even after our server explained that they were only lightly seared. Upon receiving her dish, my wife realized her mistake and ate off my plate instead. As soon as management heard she was not happy with her meal, they informed us it was being taken off the check. We told them this was not necessary but they insisted.  \n\nIf I had a complaint, it'd be with the table-side guacamole. For $10, it's really just not that good.

I really wasn't all that hungry and just ordered the small fries and a drink, while the person with me ordered a sandwich and fries, plus a drink.  Now here comes the problems.  We weren't offered water, but I thought my drink would be out quickly.  Nope, not even.  So, we waited a half hour, all the time looking back at our food sitting up on the counter.  The cooks were coming out serving people while the waitress was doing whatever it was she was doing.  Finally, we got our food and drinks.  My fries were barely warm, but I douse them with ketchup so figured since the ketchup was good, I wasn't risking waiting another half hour by complaining about the quality of the fries.  (Besides, I know better than complain to the one handling my food)  We weren't offered refills on our drinks, and by then, I just wanted to leave so I didn't ask.  Before we were finished, our waitress came and grabbed up my companion's plates.  We were never given a check, so we just went to the counter and paid our bill.  The family behind us had kids that were asking for something they had ordered and never got.  I guess we weren't the only ones that were less than pleased.",

Just my luck,  I usually end up waiting at least 40mins for a table. \nHowever,  It's worth. \nIt's a great place for tex mex. It can get pretty loud at time. \nFood, portion wise, is a lot. Therefore,  try not to eat too much of the complimentary chips and salsa.\n  \nI usually get their Gumbo. Don't know what about it that makes me keep on ordering it everytime i'm here. It's really that good.   \n\nI recommend stopping by here if you're near Delaware park casino or Christiana hospital.",

Mike's is a small ice cream parlor, one that barely fits the patrons and its popularity. There is some effort that went into decorating this place like an old school ice cream parlor, with it's small tables and chairs, counter tops, and unique wall décor. \n\nMike serves a wide selection of handmade ice cream in a variety of different ways and they are extremely generous on their scoops. Between the two of us, we shared a single scoop of pralines and cream on a waffle cone and it was almost too much--and we're both like our ice cream! The ice cream is very creamy and incredibly delicious. In this particular flavor, there were generous amounts of praline--a few in every bite, and lots of caramel swirls. Our ice cream was truly divine and it seems like everyone else's ice cream was also delicious as no one could make it to the register without first taking a bite! \n\nAlthough we didn't venture this way, I noticed a few cool things that could spice up your ice cream treat here, such as a cookie cone or a Nutella sundae...but who needs spicing to this already delicious treat? Definitely a must try and completely worth the calories!!!",

  "text": "We stopped in to the Macaroni Grill for a friends birthday lunch and this is where she wanted to go.  I'm a sucker for ravioli and I had heard they have really good ravioli.  They share a parking lot with Barnes & Noble and Great Basin Brewing so I imagine parking can be an issue during busy times.  They have two dining options - the first is with their traditional menu where you sit and a waiter takes care of you, the second is their express dining.  It's sort of a lunch line where they make the food fresh, but it's a limited menu and they do it for both lunch and dinner.  We went with the traditional dining and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and he kept the drinks and fresh bread coming.  The bread was delicious, piping hot with rosemary and they have olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli for lunch and it was really good with lots of mushrooms.  However, I think the plate may have been left under the warmer a bit too long.  The plate was scalding hot - no biggie but the parts of ravioli without sauce were very dry and almost crunchy.  That's really the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4.  I was really looking forward to that cheat lunch and it just didn't live up to my expectations.",

And now I've been twice in a week.\n\nFrom the outside, it's not much to look at. Parking looks difficult and the place looks small.  There's a whole parking lot in the back though, and the inside is bigger than it looks. Upon walking in, we were quickly greeted and told to sit wherever. We were quickly served and the waitress gave us great recommendations of some of her favorites and best sellers. The rest of the menu looked like great twists on classic meals, whcih was pretty cool. She brought out these house made chips and a dip that were very unique, and so good that we asked for another order. I ordered the Rib and Mac, which had rib meat on mac and cheese with texas toast for the bread.  It was one of the greatest things I've ever had. We also had a San Francisco burger and a V Jack burger at our table, and both said the burgers were juicy and had very good flavor combos with the toppings. Their fries that they serve as a side have the crispy outside, which are the best kind of fries.  \n\nWhile we were there, they told us about the $5 burger Mondays, which I then returned for the very next Monday. This deal has a $5 base burger which is completely customizable for add'l cost per topping. Again, the burger was very juicy and well seasoned. It was very substantial, too, not what I was expecting for a \"day of the week\" special. It's a really good deal for the amount of food you get.",

  "text": "Cute neighborhood restaurant we stumbled upon while shopping. It is located in the back corner of a plaza with Michael, nutrition smart, and some others.\n\nOne tip here is that it is cash only! But they do have an ATM in the store. One thing this place makes me feel is like I am in a small town. Despite it being located in a busy area the atmosphere feels homey. \n\nThe menu is a decent size and they offer breakfast and lunch. Looking over the menu, it looks like they have a Greek influence. There are many greek items mixed in the different categories and a while greek section. \n\nThey had many specials available, including the pumpkin pancakes. We were pretty hungry after running errands all day, so I wanted an omelette and pancakes. Luckily, they have that as an option with their omelettes. I got the Greek\nOmelette with a pumpkin pancake as my starch. I also got egg whites instead of the whole egg.\n\nWhat I liked here, was that you get a lot of food for your money, that also tastes good. My food was as described and good. I think we found a new neighborhood breakfast spot to come to!",

  "text": "Ok fine,,, I'll give it to you. I always thought that this chain was a bit too tourist trap-ish... BUT I can't just let my bias get the better of me. So we're here and we're going to smash.\n\nLet's begin shall we.\n\nWaffles:     I really enjoyed the texture, soft and crispy that's not painful to consume. The syrup was perfect accompaniment to the whole dish.\n\nMac & Cheese:     This side is fire yo, I adore the depth and meaty flavors. This dish definitely came to slay.\n\nGreens:     I can't believe I'm eating greens from a chain and it's actually phenomenal. We definitely enjoyed every bit of this dish.\n\nChicken Quarter (HOT):     WEAK, I was expecting my mouth to be on fire but it didn't. I feel as if an amateur spicy food eater can handle this level of heat. Plus the flavor was a bit lacking.\n\n3 stars, just because the opening acts should never EVER out do the main event. This spot definitely scored high marks on the side show category. High enough to forgive that excruciating wait to be seated. Anyways, it's whatever. I gave my score because I was not impressed by whatever food you're known for. People will still flock to you. Your marketing is definitely on point.\n\nThank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!",

Every time I come here even though it is so far out my way now I always get the hot chocolate with the homemade whip cream. It is extremely good if the right person is making it. Their food is pretty good too. The turkey sandwich (i can't remember the exact name of it) and the vegan whoopie pie are out of this world. The service is pretty good for a fishtown business and for some odd reason i love the kitschy decor they have here too. If i lived in the neighborhood again i could see my self being here everyday before work.",

Our waitress was flat out rude, she seemed bothered to be serving us. The place isn't exactly inexpensive (brunch and drinks for 2 was $70) and we gave her a good tip despite her attitude, she was still rude to us as we were leaving. The people next to us also had issues with their waitress not paying them any attention. \nIf it weren't for the terrible waitress and bad experience we had with her, just based on ambience, food and drinks I would have given 4 stars.",

The only reason I took off one star is for service, as it seems it can be a bit of a hit or miss. The first time I came, the waiter forgot quite a few things and charged me for a spicy mayo he never brought. The 2nd time the waiter just seemed like he was new, but he was great aside from not being too familiar with the menu. .\nThey also have happy hour specials, with discounted sushi rolls and cocktails. I recommend the Lobster Fresh roll and the 1st Avenue roll, and the Bourbon on the Ave drink. All very tasty! The Lobster Fresh really lives up to its name, as it just tastes super fresh and crisp.\nAll in all, I am a fan of this place and will definitely be returning. It's a bit of a drive for us considering we have a usual sushi place we go to near where we live, but it is worth it for evenings where you want to go downtown.",

She starts to seat us in one location and changes her mind, tells us our waitress will be right with us and leaves. We watch a waitress come by check on a table and leave. We think she's our waitress. Another two tables get seated and she goes to both of those. I finally get her attention and she claims she's not its but will take our order anyway (we had been sitting for 15 min). Get our order in, twenty min later while we are still waiting, another waitress walks up and asks if we've got our order in. We say yes and she walks off. Find out from her talking loudly to the girl who took our order that she was supposed to be our waitress and that we were in her section. Awkward.  Finally get our food and a couple of the waitresses are continuing to fuss at each other and a stack of plates are left next to our table the entire time we were there.  We only had drinks and an app luckily. We weren't the only ones to have that issue and it was a Saturday night.",

Be warned, after providing sour service they will add 20% gratuity to group checks. \n\nHere's the scoop: Attended an unfortunate happy hour here with some girlfriends. The meal was uneventful until after dessert when the bartender Cassie screamed at our table for being too loud. She said there had been complaints and that the bar area 'funnels' noise into the dining room.  I find it curious that she didn't say anything to our group about the noise earlier in the meal as we're not intending to bother others.  Another male patron told us that we were not bothering him but for reasons unknown to us he started screaming across the bar area to us, \"F**king b*tch, I'll come over there!\" Repeatedly. \"F**king b*tch\". It was unreal. Cassie then told us his behavior was 'fine'. \n\nIt was an unfortunate situation that was escalated by Cassie. We are normal people and did not intend to cause a problem. I just wish she had asked us to quiet down before she lost her temper.",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Philly for the first time a couple weeks ago. During our travels we always choose one night to go out to a high-end dinning location with beautiful views. I was pleased to find R2L which was located around the corner from our hotel. I visited their website to make a reservation which stated \"in order to guarantee a table by the window with city views you would need to spend $100/ person\" and there was a $25 reservation fee. I decided to call instead and was able to easily make a reservation without paying a fee. We decided to wing it and hope that we got a table by a window. We were greeted at the hostess stand by a very pleasant young lady which was happy to seat us  by a window. The restaurant was absolutely beautiful, the ambiance was very romantic and elegant however my excitement was cut short by the table sitting next to us. There was a table of 5 in their early 20s sitting approximately 10 feet away from us. They were loud, uneducated, with no regard for manners or restaurant etiquette. They spoked with profanity and had highly inappropriate conversations. Everyone in the restaurant patrons and employees would walk by and stare at this table. Their server which was our server was completely flustered by them needless to say we were not greeted for about 10 minutes. Once greeted we placed our wine order and she mentioned we would get our water and bread shortly. Approximately 5 minutes later the bread arrived and about 10 minutes after the bread, our water glasses were filled. About 30 minutes after being seated we finally got our wine and we were able to order. The bread was absolutely delicious! Our food was actually quick to come out. We both ordered the filet and braised short ribs with brussels sprouts and mac n cheese. Besides the mac n cheese, everything was extremely salty. I could not finish my meal because I could feel the hypertension setting in. Still very distracted by the table next to us, I decided to skip dessert. The check came its was approximately $150. My bf handed his card over and when he received the check back to sign he had been charged for another table bill $288. He mentioned it to the server and she disappeared for another 10 minutes and finally came back with the correct check. On our way out we shared the elevator with another couple and asked how their experienced was, they mentioned it wasn't very good for the price and that they had found the food to be very salty. I really wanted to love this place but it fell short, management should have been more present perhaps came over to the table next to us and had a conversation with them or perhaps when were charged double for our meal. I more than likely would not recommend this place, there are other rooftop restaurants nearby.",

  "text": "People seem to want one of two things in a coffee shop. Some want a place to enjoy a great cup of coffee and good eats above all else. Others will put up with mediocre coffee if the environment is great for studying or socializing. Sparkroot excels at providing a consistently good local bean to it's customers but...\n\n...the environment however isn't the coziest and isn't the best for trying to get things done. While there's plenty of natural light and plugs to keep you connected and productive, the furniture is more trendy than functional and there aren't many areas where groups can be truly comfortable for long periods of time. \n\nAll of that said, if you want a good cup of drip or espresso, Sparkroot won't disappoint. The food selection good and everything on the menu is worth the wait - there's always a wait as food service is slow given the single line cook on duty. The gluten free bread is spot on and the salads are fresh and filling. Their non-coffee fair including chai, teas, and fresh juice are also up to par. It's also one of the few places I've found where you can get flavored drinks that aren't full of processed sugar - the mocha is made in house with dark chocolate and the vanilla and chais are house made as well.\n\nSparkroot has a great product and good artsy vibe. As someone who enjoys coffee solo or with a buddy, Sparkroot gets 5 stars from me. However, coffee shops are expected to be social environments and Sparkroot can use some improvement. 4 stars.",

  "text": "I loved it!  The Blue Agave Restaurant has been reincarnated as \"Nectar Eatery & Lounge\"--and what an excellent makeover it has gotten.  The interior has been updated and is still very intimate and cozy with just the right touch of lively.  I started with a craft cocktail, the \"Passion Del Diablo\"--yummy!  And especially 'cuz our server, who was excellent BTW, had the bartender go easy on the chili-infused vodka so it had just the right amount of punch without being too overbearing.  Next enjoyed the goat cheese and prosciutto wrapped dates as an appetizer, and later salivated over the Portobello Burger Plank Warm Goat Cheese Crisp, Ancho Tomato, Arugula, with Fries Salad.  Outstanding all the way!  Will I be back?  You bet!",

I know they changed their cocktail sauce, fine I can live with that ...sorta. I honestly think my fish was cod not grouper, the bread was gross, think sticking a bun in the fridge then popping it in the microwave on high for 5 minutes. The steak was raw, the coconut shrimp overcooked and flavorless, dense texture, just gross.  Frozen, Sam's club would be better. \nBTW: I am suspect the main lobster was actually cold water lobster - I know this is rough, but three waitresses and one cocky woman on the phone when I called after I got back just ticked me off. She wanted to know if the food was so bad why did we bring the steak home?...I told her it was the only thing we could salvage off the whole table, I can finish cooking it here at home. If you wonder why we did not send back, all 4 MEALS bad...would seem a waste of time. If the owners are cutting corners, please stop.",

He brought us over samples without us even asking and told us to let him know what we thought! So cool. \n\nWe all ordered something different to eat and every single plate was basically licked clean.

  "text": "Hamburgers, fried noodles, beer, chicken wings, and oysters -- a unique combination!\n\nLast week was my first time back to this establishment since it re-opened a couple of months back, and I've dined there a total of 4 times already.  Bar-ly suits my cravings because there are days when I crave a hamburger with a Leffe Blonde (excellent belgian), and then there are days when I feel like having pan-fried udon with a Leffe Blonde.  So whatever is called for, Bar-ly is able to satiate my appetite.\n\nAnother staple from Bar-ly's menu:  Sriracha wings.  The wings appear to be an iteration of Korean style wings -- double fried then finished with a coating of sauce. Bottom line is Bar-ly's wings are a successful iteration, and I'm glad I do not have to drive to SoHo for wings anymore.  \n\nOysters.  Growing up right outside of New Orleans, I'm accustomed to $0.25 per oyster;  Bar-ly, however, is the closest thing to that.  Although the oysters are $1.00 a piece here, one would be hard pressed to find another establishment that can match Bar-ly's pricing.  There are typically two choices of oysters, and I usually order both just for the heck of it. \n\nBar-ly's food and beer selection, in my opinion, were wisely chosen to compliment each other.  This combined with an upbeat, fun, and welcoming atmosphere is what brings me back to Bar-ly on a weekly basis.",

  "text": "Amis is delicious.\n\nNo really, the whole restaurant is delicious.\n\nGet the squid ink pasta with chorizo- it's creamy and perfect. It's black and will probably make your smile a little silly looking, but as long as you share it, that's fine. Both you and your dining mate can have black smiles for a little bit. The bits of chorizo add just enough meat flavor to offset the otherwise too luscious nature of squid ink. \n\nThe bruschetta bread is great: it's thick and grilled with just enough olive oil to add a nice juicy crunch. The imported buffalo ricotta is creamy, but that's about it. It's fluffy, but there's not much flavor.The salami, similarly, is fine. It's cured meat, and the beet jam is pretty good. If you put the salami on the buffalo ricotta, then you've created a great appetizer. The mild saltiness of the meat combines nicely with the otherwise undetected sweetness of the black pepper ricotta. \n\nAs for dessert, you'd be a complete idiot not to indulge in the tartufo al bacio\" chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo - even if you're allergic to nuts. Basically, you've got some sort of semifreddo mousse/ice cream blend speckled with hazelnut halves covered in a dark chocolate fondant ganache. It's a hill of succulent indulgence with the perfect sweetness offset by the perfect bitterness of the dark chocolate.",

  "text": "Ok, this is my first ever yelp review.  I feel like I have to say something.\n\nThe crepes are ok.  It's not amazing, it's just...average.  Their filling is good, but the texture of the wrap is disgusting.  It's soggy and gross. Especially after transferring from Berkeley, crepe a go go has fantastic crepes.  There's just something about their batter makes their crepes very crispy and fluffy.  Cafe Equilibrium pales in comparison, but what I REALLY want to try are their waffles.  For some odd reason, their waffle maker keeps falling apart everytime I visit and am craving for a waffle. It's not like they're gonna reimburse me because customers typically pay first before they make your food here.  It's really upsetting.  Their gelato is average at best; I've had better, loads better.  \n\nSo I guess what i'm trying to say is, can you PLEASE fix your waffle maker?  Or at least buy a new one? I don't eat out often, and on those several occasions I want a waffle, it would be nice if THE OWNER doesn't look at me pitifully and say , word by word too,  \"sorry...the waffle maker is misbehaving ; would you like a crepe instead?.\"   NO I WANT A WAFFLE.  IF I WANTED A CREPE, I WILL ASK FOR A CREPE. Goddamn , I hope the owner sees this so MAYBE, just MAYBE they'll finally fix it\n\nIt's sad that I signed on to yelp just to vent.",

  "text": "Get there early is all I can recommend. Getting there 2 hours before close, most of the items were sold out. Which speaks well of the food, and the adage of being early.\n\nI had gotten into St. Pete that day and while hanging with friends, was debating on what to eat. We ended up talking for a while and debating food spots. All I really wanted was something I can't get good back in California - barbecue! This had great reviews, a huge menu, and a parking lot. Works for me.\n\nWe arrived, and from the menu in the door there were already items crossed off. When we got to the host, he mentioned they had closed off sections already and for the quickest service would be the bar. My friend and I didn't have a problem with that, but still a weird thing to say.\n\nAs we were checking out the menu, we asked the bartender for his recommendations. He gave us a bunch, but then it turned into a sad state of \"Uh oh, we're out of that.\"\n\nStick ribs? Sold out.\nMac & Cheese? Sold out.\nPork Belly? Sold out.\nSt. Louis Ribs? Sold out.\n\nWith what options were available, we went with the following:\n\nWhat's Caulilini - Fried cauliflower in a light oil. I know, not what you would expect to order, but with a big dinner, figured something light and roughage would be solid. And these are tasty!\n\nMy friend and I each got a Texas Two Step. Mine came with Sliced Brisket, Pork Brisket, Sandi's Bacon Blue Cheese Slaw, and Fries. The sliced brisket is excellent, really enjoyed that. The pork brisket was okay. The fattier pieces were more enjoyable, but required a lot of chewing. The slaw and fries were both great. \n\nMy friend got the Burnt Ends, aka Meat Candy. GET THOSE! So tasty.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back to Dr. BBQ, just at an earlier hour so I could get everything I wanted. Definitely those burnt ends.",

  "text": "Let's start with the service. It's 2 45 on Tuesday.  There are three customers and myself. I start speaking with the server, two sentences in to the conversation two people walk in. You interrupt the conversation without excusing yourself to. We start again. Same thing. This is unacceptable . I ordered wings and a pulled pork fondue. The wings were tasty and had a nice kick.  The pork was burnt and bone dry, the fondue hardeneed. Nice presentation in cast iron pan. Terrible end product. Called the next week and left a message asking for the manager to contact me, so I could provide feedback regarding the exoeriece.....food and inaatentive, sloppy customer service....no call back....will not be returning ....way too many excellent quality restaurants at all price points then to chance another time for service that tells me   I don't care about you or my job",

Ladies - dress up a little, and be sure to check out the restroom! \nFOOD: The fig and chevre 1st course, and the pierogie 1st course were both amazing. Also had the puttanesca - delish! Pork chop wasn't my fave, it wasn't quite cooked long enough for my taste. But the dessert - popcorn profiteroles - a must!!\nSERVICE: Didn't see any non-alcoholic drinks listed on the menu and had to ask the waiter. The waiter also disappeared and was replaced by another guy - who was also very nice - but then the original guy came back just as our dessert was being served, so that was kinda weird.",

Good to go halvesies on it with someone else and also split that sammy. Great mac and cheese as well, and yummy pickles.

  "text": "Cafe La Maude is the quintessential Philly destination for an excellent weekend brunch. The service was fast and efficient. They have outdoor booths open that allowed for fairly spaced out outdoor dining. The food was excellent. Between the two of us, we shared the Red Shakshuka and the Apple Pie Banana Pancakes which were excellent portion sizes. The red shakshuka was an excellent blend of Lebanese sausage and tomato flavors with a delicious touch of Harissa Labneh; the entire meal was hearty but not too heavy even with the pita bread. The Apple Pie Banana Pancakes were an interesting combination of green pancakes with bananas inside and caramelized apples with blueberry cream cheese yogurt. Overall we felt safe and had an excellent meal, would definitely go again.",

  "text": "I was visiting my girlfriend in Philadelphia and she made a reservation at Scarpetta because it was near her apartment and had availability on a Friday night. What was expected to be a pleasant Friday evening turned into an infuriating dining experience.\n \nTo start, we were seated behind a pillar and no one attended to us for the first 15 minutes. I noticed four Caucasian girls were seated behind us after us and were immediately greeted with menus and glasses of water. Our designated waiter realized we were waiting without menus after flirting with the four girls for a good 5 minutes. (Fred C.) had a look of -oh shit- written across his face. He finally came by with menus and asked what type of water we wanted.\n \nAfter taking our order, we still did not receive our water and two Caucasian girls were seated next to us. We finally received our water after they served us our drinks. Then, we noticed the girls next to us received their bread basket, and yet again, our table did not. Our appetizers came and still our bread never came. We had to bring it to the waiter's attention and THEN he immediately brought our bread basket over.\n \nIt was becoming difficult to feel like this was not an act of discrimination. We brought it to the attention of the manager and he responded with \"Sorry, it is really busy. We will give you an extra dessert.\" I am not sure why he thought dessert would fix everything and he completely ignored the fact that we felt neglected throughout the entire dining experience thus far. It felt like he wanted the dessert to shut us up and it would make up for all the mistreatment at a dinner I am paying for with my time and money. It seems obvious a restaurant would be busy on a Friday night, and so why was that an excuse? Did he want a pity party? Did he want us to sympathize with him and manage the restaurant for him? I've been to busier restaurants with impeccable service despite the crowds. (Honestly, it wasn't even that busy for a Friday night.)\n \nFinally, the bill came and instead of charging my girlfriend and I for the glass of wine we ordered, he charged us each for a bottle. I was livid and done with the entire experience at that point. I probably should have walked out the first 15 minutes. Safe to say I will not come back just to pay to be treated with negligence for an hour of my life I will never get back.",

Didn't even know what would be possible thanks to Corona Virus. \n\nBut once I had walked the entire loop at Arbuckle Park, capturing the scene as I went, I worked myself up a good appetite. But where to go?\n\nJust then there was a frenzy of activity in my brain as I considered where I was, remembered Plainfield and The Oasis Diner was not far away, and finally might be able to use a gift certificate I'd been saving for the perfect opportunity. \n\nSo #Franny and I headed to Plainfield. We #found the diner, I scanned the menu, and I ordered something I'd never dreamed possible but wore the name of the restaurant: The Oasis Burger \n\nAnd it was delivered just as described: two beef patties covered with cheese, bacon, pulled pork bbq, slaw, and pickles, served on a brioche bun with a side of fries. \n\nThe only thing I could do when it was in front of me was laugh. And pick up my fork and knife and dive in!\n\nAll I can say is that it was so sloppy but so good that I didn't feel the bbq sauce all over my chin until I was driving back to INDY, AFTER I had said goodbye to the staff! ‍\n\nAnd, no, I could not eat it all.

  "text": "This restaurant was highly recommended to us by many, many people. We were very excited to try it out one day while we were at Indie flea market. It was very crowded but that seems to be the norm. We were seated after about 20 minutes and from there the experience worsened. We have to say this may be one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We had extremely long wait times in between our server stopping at the table. There were employees everywhere but it still seemed to be slower than ever. Our food took over 35 minutes to get to us and we had only ordered two sandwiches and a cup of soup. When our food came, we asked for ketchup. The server said she would go and get some, however, she never came back. We waited about 20 minutes and held off on the fries, ha ha, and finally asked a staff member that walked by for some ketchup. That person said they would go get some. But again they never returned... So over 30 minutes later we asked our server for a second time for some ketchup. It came to us about five minutes later. It confused us because all of the sandwiches were served with fries, yet they did not have ketchup anywhere handy. They had to go back into the kitchen to get the little cup of ketchup. After our plates had been taken away when we were done with our food, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our waitress to come back to give us the check. we never were even offered drink refills. Not even for water. we saw our waitress standing off to the side talking with another employee and giving us a weird look. We didn't really know what that was all about because we hadn't made any complaints. Finally , we waved someone down who got our waitress to give us the check. She was very rude and just dropped the check on the table and walked away. We really don't know what was going on the day that we went. It seems like they were staffed appropriately. We do not intend on going back here, as there are many other options in the area that we would rather go to that have nicer / more attentive employees.",

The first time I had the crab cakes which were nicely crafted except I like them to be fried a little bit more so they are crunchier on the outside but the flavor profile was spot on.  The second time I had the appetizer as a meal of mussels in a garlic white wine sauce mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm so delicious.  I can't say enough good things about this.  First of all the portion was very generous I had a whole other meal out of the left overs.  The mussels were perfectly cooked and the broth was so yummy I couldn't  get enough of it.  My mother had the spinach lasagna which I also sampled and I don't care for the red sauce or gravy but I could have eaten this sauce by the jar full it was sooooo good.  My mother actually wanted to know if they sell the gravy by the jar because she would be a regular customer.  The lasagna consisted of a lot of ricotta and mozzarella cheese and in my book you can never have too much ooey  gooey cheese on anything.  Very much a comfort food and again the portion was more than generous.  For dessert we shared a piece of tiramisu and our server told us it had just been freshly made and indeed it was so fresh and good the only thing that it was missing was the coffee liquor which would have made it over the top fantastic.  Everything was very fresh and delicious and I will be certainly going back there more often now that I know I can have a great meal there!",

  "text": "This is kind of a hip/trendy burger joint with a cultivated \"divey\" feel to it (i.e. I'm sure that's exactly what they were trying for).  They have an \"OMFG\" burger challenge, and apparently the Man vs Food guy showed up to do it once.  If you finish their 3 lb burger in 30 minutes it's free.  I think that was the challenge.  If not, it's something like $30 for that burger.\n\nThere are only a few tables, so you may or may not get seated anytime soon.  We got lucky that there was one table available when we showed up.  They were just cleaning it, so those folks had recently left.  Shortly after we sat down other people showed up but the place was full.\n\n\"Is it worth waiting?\", you ask.  Weeeellllll....maybe.\n\nTheir menu features some unique burgers.  How about one with peanut butter on it?  How about another where each half of the bun is actually a grilled cheese sandwich (so, yes, you get TWO grilled cheese sandwiches with that burger)?  You can do some customizing if you choose, and they do have a few more conventional burgers.  The burgers are 1/2 lb patties.\n\nI got the shroom burger but changed the cheese and put the sauce on the side.  The sauce it turns out is chipotle and Thousand Island.  Tangy and spicy to the point that it would overwhelm the burger if you aren't careful.  I added just a little bit because without it the burger was very ordinary.  Not bad.  Reasonably good, actually.  But ordinary.  I could get a comparable burger at Red Robin for less (plus bottomless fries!).\n\nSpeaking of fries, those are a separate side dish here.  Not included with your burger.  Now to their credit the fries were cooked perfectly and had a nice seasoning.  They also offered a \"gravy\" dip (for an extra charge) that was a peppery-beef gravy.  It actually worked quite well with the fries, but I thought it kinda stingy of them not to offer it free with the fries.  How much would a little cup of that gravy cost them, really?  Especially when the order of fries was half the price of one of the burgers!\n\nSo my verdict?  Good burgers, good fries, good gravy.  Not fantastic, but good.  A bit pricey.  However, if you're military (former or active) they do give a 10% discount.\n\nService was OK.  All interactions were friendly, but they were pretty busy so they didn't check on us much.",

Healthy yet extremely tasty; has vegan/vegetarian options aplenty if that's your jam. This place is so delicious that I order takeout there a few times a week. In particular, their rotating entree specials tend to be amazing, so be sure to ask about those. Great salads as well. Lots of organic/wild-caught fare.\n\n- Ambiance/People etc.: The staff there is awesome. Super, super friendly, and they seem very invested in you enjoying their restaurant as much as they do. Seems like a tight-knit crew. It has a casual, relaxed ambiance that is very enjoyable for dine-in. They always have really cool Caribbean cocktails as well. \n\nCan't recommend the place enough. Truly awesome. Please go and enjoy!!",

The calamari is in long strips rather than little rings and comes with dipping sauce. The duck burger is not greasy at all and you should try it with a side of crispy brussel sprouts which are my new favorite unhealthy veggie.  The bison burger is good as well.  We have both eaten here and had it delivered.  i would have been more prone to give them five stars if they would put their delivery food in better containers but they send it out in coated cardboard boxes which may be green but it is rather unappetizing to have some things thrown in a box.  Its okay for a sandwich but we have had pasta from there delivered in the same kind of container and it is just not appetizing.   This is not to be critical but I can say we would order from there more often if they had different take out containers.",

Some are better than others.  \n\nMy personal favorites are:\nStan's Stack\nRex's Revenge\nMax's Muffalatta\nAvi's Avo\nJoel's jolt\nIts Greek  to Me salad\n\nThe only problem with some of the sandwiches is the bread can be pretty much impossible to eat without your sandwich falling apart.  They put a tooth next to the hard bread, which are often very tasty options, but are too hard to eat when making up a sandwich.  They let you substitute any bread though, so just in case you don't want a super hard bread.  \n\nThe sandwiches are huge and will often be impossible to eat the entire thing.  The stan's stack is basically 2 sandwiches, so for 10 bucks you can really get 2 meals.  \n\nFor sides, the pasta salad is really good.  But I like the kettle chips.\n\nThe iced tea is awesome.  \n\nThe desserts are amazing.  I always get a peanut butter chocolate cookie.  My all time favorite cookie.",

I like your concept and quirky atmosphere, but my positive feelings stop there.\n\nI don't mind paying a little extra for good fresh, local food... but not THIS much extra, especially for food that tastes far from fresh. I don't remember the exact price tag off hand, but maybe I'm extra bitter since I also had to buy myself another lunch elsewhere afterward. \n\nThe lobster pizza sounded amazing, but tasted like microwaved fish sticks.  I had once piece and had to stop.

I decided to be fancy and get a mimosa, but 10 minutes later she came back to tell me they were out of orange juice and she was making it a poinsettia (with cranberry) instead. Well, ok then.\n\nSlow service, bad food, hefty price tag...

It was about 9pm on a Tuesday so State Street wasn't crowded, so I just had my date drive down the street until I spotted \"this really good Italian restaurant that my mom and I discovered years ago and that Brittany and I always used to go to\".  I swear, this place gets better every time I go!\n\nOn this visit, I ordered the Brie and Garlic Appetizer and my date ordered the Ravioli Sampler (cus I told him how good it was from past visits!).  The garlic bread here is so good, btw....my date loved it and ate practically the whole basket!  They brought out another, which we took with our leftovers!\n\nThe Brie and Garlic was sooo good!  Warm oozing delicious brie cheese, topped with caramelized walnuts, a whole clove (is that what it's called) of garlic that was so soft and tasty, a few slices of pear and sliced french bread.  I was eating it without the bread cus it was sooo good and I'd rather save the carb calories for the pasta!\n\nThe waitress mistakenly put the wrong order into the kitchen and they brought out something called the Pascucci Pasta(I think) instead of the Ravioli Sampler.  So we did have to wait a few minutes for them to prepare the raviolis, but my date was stoked cus he got to sample another dish!  It had some kind of spicy sauce on it, so other than the one bite he coerced me into taking, I steered clear.  But he really enjoyed it.  \n\nThe Ravioli Sampler is delicious.  Cheese with marinara, Italian sausage, portabello mushroom(YUM!), gorgonzola(I think this one's my fav), and butternut squash(pumpkin pie, I swear!).\n\nWashed down with a glass of Pinot Grigio and I believe the proper term for this meal is : Spectacular!  I definitely will not let four year pass before my next visit :-)",

I had the Enlightened Bamboo dish, and as cheesy as the name sounds, the meal was delicious.  Very flavourful.  Being a BYOB makes this place even more appealing, AND it had online 20% coupons!   My only complaint was that when I requested to have the 3 hot chill peppers for level of spicyness (yeah i handle my spice), which they advertised on their menu as 'needing a distinguisher' (yeah instead of extinguisher, you can overlook English errors when the food is this tasty). Anyway, the dish in my opinion was not spicy at all!  Especially since when I asked the waitress for it she said I was so brave for even requesting it and that not many people do.   So I ended up getting extra chilli sauce on the side. Anyway, I definitely recommend this place despite what level of spice you get!",

  "text": "We've had good and bad experiences with Olive Garden. It's becoming less of a value as their menu prices seem to be increasing more frequently. \n\nLast night my family and I had dinner. Kris was our server. She was off from the start; seemed confused or something. I think every step of the way she made mistakes, not just with our table, but the party of 8 adjacent to us. The manager comped some of their food, but I guess word of the poor service we experienced didn't make its way to the manager's attention. I decided it just wasn't worth it.\n\nWe finished our meals and asked for (2) to-go containers. Kris brought back 7 of them! She then watched as I combined two entrees into a single container and when I looked up, she was shaking her head and said they weren't going to fit. Well, they fit and I had plenty of room left over. Now, what was I going to do with the extra to-go containers? And, why the hell did she bring so many in the first place?\n\nWhen we were finished, Kris asked if we paid our bill already. I told her no. How could we? Upon leaving, I paid our bill while Kris hovered over me watching me getting ready to apply the tip at the table kiosk. I looked up at her with a quizzical look and then she explained how the slider looked. I told her I was very familiar with it. \n\nThe total price of our bill, including tip, was around $51. I mistakenly left without a receipt. On the drive home I calculated our three entrees and my daughter's milk. It came to ~$43 with tax and tip. It didn't add up. I'm thinking now we paid someone else's bill.\n\nThe funniest thing was when Kris brought a tray to clear some of our dishes, she left in right in front of my wife's chair, not allowing her to get up. Kris walked away and my wife squirmed out of her seat.",

A table for two. \n\nThe menu is upscale trendy but the food is traditional breakfast. I ordered the avocado breakfast sandwich which was served on a grilled sour dough bread with egg and avocado. The sandwich was good, but a little greasy and could have used more avocado. \n\nThey do a brisk morning carry out business with a significant group of regulars.",

  "text": "The burger was terrible. It tasted more like meatloaf or a meatball than a hamburger and it was not cooked well done as requested. The \"Red Hook Ale fried shrimp\" were bland without much flavor. The shrimp in the breading looked (and tasted) like the kind of shrimp you would find in one of those prepackaged cocktail rings at the grocery store or the kind that you would find in cheap Chinese food. Coleslaw was bland as well and very stringy. Not chopped enough. The \"half moon mozzarella\" looked and tasted as if it were purchased from the frozen food section of a grocery store. Sure, they cut them in half and presented them on a bed of lettuce with \"homemade\" marinara sauce on the side but they still tasted store bought. Lastly, I am currently writing this from the toilet at 1:45 am and my girlfriend whom I took there for dinner is feeling nauseated. Please avoid this restaurant.",

We and our 50 guests had a wonderful time, and a huge part of the credit goes to the Montecito Wine Bistro and in particular to the manager, Ernesto, and the chef, Victor.  \n\nFrom our initial tasting at the restaurant, we knew Ernesto was a find.  We wanted a one of a kind evening for our friends and family with a special dinner and just the right wines.  Ernesto got that from the start.  His suggestions were perfect but he made sure we sampled plenty of dishes and wines so that we were confident in the final menu.  Then, Ernesto helped us plan the evening, including the layout and the timing so we never felt rushed and had plenty of time to enjoy the company and the lovely setting.  \n\nChef Victor delivered a dinner that was every bit as good as the tasting we had at the restaurant.  From the hors d'oeuvres (ahi bites, kobe meatloaf sliders & bruschetta) to the 4 course dinner (kale salad, ravioli al limone, sea bass en papillote & karabuta pork spare ribs) to the dessert (peach cobbler, chocolate tarte & creme brulee), the timing and the food were perfection.  \n\nThis was a dinner we and our friends will be talking about for years to come.  Thank you Ernesto and Chef Victor!",

Some walking out looked happy. \nCouple of pic a nic tables outside on a beautiful November day with some nice looking food being eaten. Couldn't wait. \nWe went inside and got in a line about 12 ahead of us. It went fast. Some people just came in for the huge, fresh made, decadent donuts and pastries and coffee. \nIt was noon, so we had brunch. Yes, donuts and sandwiches.  \nThere are stools facing the kitchen, booths along the wall, and it seems like it's a bigger place than it is. \nPlaced our order with a very cute freckle faced girl who was patient with our goofy acting selves.\nTHE FOOD: First up for me...Irish Coffee donut with hot cocoa. Nice soft bite on the donut, tasty, light but sweet frosting. \nCocoa was just ok.\nWaffle fries, a little less done than I like (I like my fried potato foods done a little darker), but hot and good. \nThe cheeseburger I had with bacon and a fried egg. It's quite delicious and, although it's little more than slider sized, satisfies the appetite I had. It had great flavor. It says B&B pickle on the menu, I thought it was cucumber slice on the burger, but in any case, added a little fresh crunch and lightness. Of course, the girl who would be my gf took some of my bacon...so there's THAT!\nThe girl who steals my bacon started with a muffuletta on a toasted, tasty bagel. The meats and cheese were exceptional. Not a lot, but packed with flavor. The olive mix was delicious, and overall, again, small portion, just enough,....but dynamite! She also had a had a kind of Double/Triple chocolate roll. Dark, rich, sweet, chocolate with bits of chocolate on top with some lighter chocolate mousse-like stuff squirted inside. I took 2-3 bites and had a sugar rush like a kid after Halloween. The girl who would be my gf was having a blast fingering the chocolate hole inside, so.... ?? \nShe loved it. \nThey had a nice late 80's, early 90's mix of music playing which made the girl who fingers the roll hole sing out loud. Maybe it was the sugar. \nLove this place. Not too expensive, 2 sandwiches, 2 donuts, fries, cocoa.. $27 bucks. \nGood atmosphere.",

We went a few times when they first opened and of course the line and wait was incredibly long but it was worth the wait. The boba is always cooked perfectly which is one of the biggest issues with boba shops in Reno.\n\nLike most places you can customize ice, sweetness, and select from a plethora of toppings. I'm typically a milk tea loyal but the fruit teas here have got me branching out! Try a guava green tea, made slush, with aloe vera. SO good on a hot summer day! Otherwise you can always count on the signature milk tea, thai tea, taro milk tea, or wintermelon milk tea all with their golden boba (and maybe some egg pudding).\n\nOnce they introduced the online ordering it made it a much better experience: not having to wait in line in the very tiny shop, especially during COVID times. While it hasn't happened recently, in the earlier days there was always something wrong with our order. Wrong/missing topping, forgotten sweetener, wrong size, missing drink etc. Since it had only just opened and was very busy I didn't want to be too quick to judge but it was frustrating that it had happened so many times. \n\nOverall a great place that I think has finally found its feet and I hope it sticks around!",

I ordered the butternut squash pasta, which consisted of 3 noodles (no exaggeration), this greasy sour cream tasting butter sauce, shavings of kale, and 5 tiny pieces of squash ($17 and barely a side dish; rating 3/10). Their beer seems reasonably priced ($5-6) but is served in a half pint glass, which they fail to mention. I realize that this place is going for the fancy upscale vibe, but at least call it what it is....small plates, so people realize they will have to buy at least 2 to make a meal. Of note, my sister said her pasta, some pesto and pork thing, was \"okay\" so maybe some of their dishes are mediocre. However, I wouldn't pay $17 for 3 mediocre noodles. I gave them 2 stars for the nice atmosphere and staff.",

  "text": "We were looking forward to this meal so very much. It had been recommended by multiple friends. Upon reading their website, we realized my boyfriend needed a sport jacket (which is required). We decided to go out and purchase a jacket while we were in NOLA to eat here and see what it was all about. We ate here last night at 9:30. Upon walking in the restaurant it was nothing as I expected. Very bright lights, odd 1940s wall paper, bright white tile floor, and gold fixtures. I decided that it was what they were going for as it is a very old restaurant, and I got over it. We sat down and thought we would be on the second floor (as walk ins are seated on the first) I don't know if there is a difference, but we gladly took our spot on the first floor and didn't say anything. We were greeted very enthusiastically by a server who was very casual. She told us that crab is \"out of season\" and we should get crawfish instead.... Ok. A few minutes later another server came and took over without introducing herself. This server told us they were out of crab for the night. I'm sorry but crab is on half ur menu! How can u be \"out\" esp. When the other woman told us it's out of season and not to get it. They brought out bread and butter. The bread was a simple French loaf and they do not use bread plates. For appetizers we ordered the soufflé potatoes and the crawfish Maison (they were out of crabmeat...) the crawfish were tasty. Very poor presentation. On a bed of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes slices that needed some more time in the greenhouse. The soufflé potatoes reminded me of a French fry missing it's insides... I've never had this before, but it was strange. Main courses I ordered the drum fish with the meunière almandine and my boyfriend got the shrimp étouffée. My fish was dry, fried (as recommended) and tasteless. The almonds were sliced and roasted- definitely not a sauce as I expected. It was so disappointing. My boyfriend's étouffée was actually delicious, the one highlight o our meal. Our (very over salted) sautéed spinach came out after our entrees and our server forgot the turtle soup which we asked for as an app. She told us she was sorry and she would go check and not charge us for it. She \"checked\" and told us she couldn't get us any. Now I have served a lot in my day and know for damn sure the kitchen had put it away. But clearly we r from out of town and ur supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the French quarter! Go get that soup out of the cooler and heat it up, or offer something else. Anyway, we were so disappointed. I can go on. I was just underwhelmed and so unimpressed with the food here. Our waitress never checked on us and our bus boy was way more attentive. We would have asked about the soup way earlier if she would have came to check on us. The entire restaurant was closing down and putting stuff away, which I understand but there were still 4 tables. Another server was counting her money at one of the tables too. The entire staff seemed ready to bounce even though there were still customers dining. They have suit jackets at the front in case u forgot urs. So if you're wearing jeans and a hoodie they will make u put on a jacket and u can still eat there. There was a table dressed like this, and the women all had jeans and sweatshirts on and the men had the coats the restaurant lend them. This to me was cheesy as hell. I get what ur trying to do, but either enforce ur dress code, or don't have one. A nice restaurant should have a reputation and not have to do this. The manager also was very apologetic to a 4 top table of older clientele (bc our server was also theirs and forgot something too). But he said nothing to us. Just because we are young doesn't mean we should not be treated the same. Plus, we have social media at the tips of our fingers and are more likely to impact what others think. If ur in NOLA and want a nice dinner, don't waste your time here. Go to restaurant August or somewhere that u will be wined and dined for the price you are paying.",

They greet you as soon as you walk in and make sure you know how to place your order.\n\nThe tables are always super clean and you never have to fight for a spot. If it's ever too packed, the upstairs seating is nice and cozy.\n\nI used to order sandwiches all the time, love their warm bread. (Warming is optional). When I found out that I had a gluten intolerance, I was crushed... until I discovered the bowlwhich. The bowlwich is like a salad of all your favorite ingredients. I love it just as much as I loved the sandwiches. \n\nLast, they have a sweet rewards program with double punches on Tuesdays (I think Tuesdays, don't quote me on that). Each time you fill a punch card, you get a free item. It's pretty awesome. \n\nI highly recommend this place!",

I understand that their patience might be thin with all the tourists but those tourists keep Pat Os in business and they've chosen to work in the service industry. \n\nMy fiance and I had a table in the piano bar for a few hours and had the famous hurricanes. We were ready to leave so I said that I was going to use the bathroom and come back and get him. The bathroom is outside the piano bar and up the stairs. On returning from the bathroom, the man attending the entrance to the piano bar refused to let me in. He insisted that I had to wait at the end of a very long line. I explained that I had a table and I just needed to get in to get my fiance and then we would leave. He didn't care and maintained that I had to wait at the end of the line. As I stood there in shock and amazement, a man came up to my right with drinks in his hand. The attendant told him to go to the end of the line and the guy said that he had a table and had been there since 2pm. The attendant then let the guy in. I looked at him, confused and infuriated, and he said that he hadn't seen me before so I wasn't allowed in. I tried to call my fiance but he couldn't hear me over the noise. Frustrated and irate, I stopped a lady on her way out and asked if she would get a guy sitting alone with four empty hurricane glasses on the table. My fiance came out and we left. \n\nAfter this experience, I will never go to another Pat O'Brians. Also, if you want to get a good hurricane that doesn't burn the tastebuds off your tongue, skip Pat Os and go to Lafitte's Blacksmith. Soooo Good.",

I can say, however, our servers, all three times, were quick to turn the music down when we asked. I addressed this with the manager (on Facebook) and got a speedy and positive response. I have faith that they're really watching the volume now.\n\nEnough with the quibbling. The food was delicious. I am a particular fan of their pasta dishes but the pizzas, soups, and salads were also \"a cut above the average\" -- fresh and delicious. Basically, there's something for everyone in the family on the menu.\n\nIn three visits, the service has been very-good-to-excellent.\n\nNice attribute: easy seating for larger parties. This will be a go-to place for extended family dinners and birthday parties, for sure!\n\nWe're so pleased to have this new restaurant in the neighborhood. Keep up the good work, you guys!",

(wide variety) I opted for Syberg's famous house salad: a crunchy romaine/iceberg lettuce blend tossed with pimento, red onion, provel cheese, homemade croutons -ending with and a delectable ranch dressing featuring garlic overtones. My other side choice was a generous amount of crinkle cut fries -think Nathan's. My guest ordered fish also. The fish and chip basket. Four small cod loins hand dipped in Old Bay seasoning -fried to perfection, served alongside buffalo seasoned cottage fries and a sampling of cole slaw. (think Cracker Barrel). A rather tasty- rather small entree. It was more like a costly snack. Did I mention the meals come with....... BREAD! Joe Fazio hoagie rolls-that Is- complete with butter pats. All in all a decent meal. Next time I might just order a pizza. Apparently, another fan favorite. Sorry, no shark chunks. Are they offered as a pizza topping?",

  "text": "So, this place is on my way home and I so want to like it, but past few visits have been just ok. Grave and am bartenders are nice, but LOUD in smoking section at 530 am. Ordered food, BLT with avocado, got a total of 3 small slices of it on entire sandwich, kind of disappointing and Acapulco Fettuccine.  Total of 5 shrimp, no parmesan and mushy fettuccine.  Flavor was good though and didn't take overly long to get it. Last visit, blue cheese bacon burger was good, but well done. Fail on that one, Archie's will beat FT on a burger hands down,  sorry. Fish and chips is always a winner and they give you 4 BIG pieces of fish. It seems clean overall. They have giant draft beers. Parking is good. They also have gaming. If you buy in for $20 and spend the whole $20, you get ONE free drink. Kind of high for just one drink imo. Overall, good local place with pool, music, food and drinks.",

(The waffles and pulled chicken were both dry, as well.)\n\nIf the owners simply want Rose Petals to be a diner that has a warm, coffee shop decor, then they've succeeded. However, if if they truly want it to be more, and compete with the various brunch places in Center City, then they must use better quality ingredients (preferably organic, which would be a great selling point). Also, fresh, natural iced-tea would be nice.\n\nI really want to like this place, especially since I respect what the owners are trying to do for the community.

I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a great bagel; why would you go to a chain place when you could support locals, and the product is infinitely better? The only improvement could be in selection- I would love to see some whole wheat everything bagels, or multigrain styles.\n\nThey also sell doughnuts, which are good, very good, and fresh... but not great. Then again, I have been to Doughnut Plant NYC, which was basically life-changing, so again, bar set high. But it's a nice bonus when I'm picking up bagels to bring home a treat. If you're into really soft, light, yeasty doughnuts, you will like these. Husband enjoyed the red velvet cake doughnut.",

My favorite is the goat cheese and pesto unfortunately for some reason they took that off the menu - which I'd like to go on record as saying I am upset about that.  My second favorite (which is still on the menu) is the Pistachio herbed Ricotta with Lavender Honey.  Tria's food is on the lighter side.  Usually when I go with someone else we load up on brushetta and cheese and split a panino.  One of my favorites is the Smoked Chicken panino.  During happy hour they have good beer specials.  If you don't feel like drinking while you there I recommend the passionberry iced tea.  It's bottomless - can't beat that.\n\nService:\nI've been here countless times and never had a problem with the service.  Everyone is nice and the food comes out quickly.\n\nAmbiance:\nIt depends which one you go to.  The one around 13th is bigger and has nice heated outside seating.  The one at 17th and sansom is smaller and since you can't make a reservation you have to get there before 5 to get a table.  The inside are both are basically the same.  Hardwood floors and a nice bar.  Candle at the table.  It can get a bit loud but other than that it's a nice place to eat.",

Tucked in the adorable town of Sweedsboro, Botto's is a must visit. Reservations are welcomed and their menu is filled with infinite gluten free pasta options, which is always a plus for us since we do our best to avoid gluten.\n\nTo be honest, I'm writing this review past due, so I'll do my best to recap the details. My fiancé and I both started with cocktails...both were fruity and refreshing.\n\nFor appetizers we tried the crab bisque and antipasto salad. The soup was absolutely delicious: smooth and creamy in the most perfect way. The salad was good, but the cheeses were just a bit too pungent for my liking...that's not saying much though- I'm more of a boring cheese eater (sadly admitted).\n\nJ got the GF chicken park which doesn't miss...he's gotten it multiple times at this point and it's consistently tasty.\n\nMy go-to is the GF penne alla vodka with grilled chicken. It is THE BEST!!! The chicken always has that fresh grilled taste to it and the sauce on tender penne is just to die for.\n\nBotto's is known for their sausage, as I'm sure you've seen their packages in stores...worth trying at the restaurant! Very, very good! Also, be sure to visit their Italian market which is packed with a variety of fresh Italian goodies. I especially recommend trying their desserts.",

  "text": "To frame my experience with Dooners I will preface with this disclaimer: my review largely reflects my feelings of Dooner as a place to get some late-night eats after a night out in Downtown St. Petersburg. After the demise of Fortunato's a block, over it's getting pretty hard to find something greasy and satisfying late at night within easy grasp downtown. Dooners can easily fill that void! \n\nI went here with some friends after a couple of rounds and we split the Dooner fries ($10.99). It was pretty filling for four adults, and I really liked their take on a Dooner. The vegetables were unfortunately an upcharge but it made for a perfect endcap for our night out. The single dooners (which are basically pitas) are also a great choice if you're feeling particularly hungry.\n\nIt's also worth noting that I've been coming to Dooners since I was in high school and I have noticed a bit of a change in the quality of their food. If you're looking for a proper schawarma/dooner/gyro experience (especially when all your faculties are intact!), I'd try another place downtown before considering this one. It's not exactly the cleanest or most aesthetically pleasing place on this block, especially considering St. Pete's recent glo-up.",

The scallops are perfect - not mushy nor hard.  The sauce is rich but not overboard and the homemade garganelli is al dente!  I also loved the Fried Oysters Rockefeller.  Such an interesting make-over.  I didn't have but my son did - and he thought it quite good - was the KFC Sandwich.  The kimchee looked like it could be chopped a little better, but oh well.  The truffle fries were a big hit with my son but I thought they could be a tad warmer.",

  "text": "This is a tricky review to write. But I'm sure the next time I visit it'll be a 5 star visit. It took a while for a waiter to come introduce himself/take an order. To the point that he had 90 seconds to appear before I was gonna walk out. Ironically after we were finally tended to, a manager came by shortly after to see if we had been helped. So I appreciate that. Maybe they were a bit short staffed that night. \n\nWe went for spiked milkshakes. My beau got the Reese's one but wasn't satisfied with the alcohol content. I got the maple bourbon or whatever it's called and let me tell you. That's the way to go if you're looking for alcohol. In fact I wanted to order more ice cream to sort of disguise the alcohol more lol. It was delicious nonetheless. And I'm confident in assuming their non spiked milkshakes are good too. They know how to make a tasty milkshake man. \n\nAs for the food. I ordered the popular Kentucky burger (or maybe it was Tennessee, I forget lol). I thought it was dry. I ordered extra glaze on the side thinking it would be like Jack Daniels bbq or at least a thicker consistency and it was NOT what I was looking for lol. Next time I would go heavy on the toppings. Order mayo and bbq sauce. The burger had a nice grilled taste to it. But I just wish it was juicier. I did get it well done. But I'm used to having well done burgers being juicy still. \n\nI'll definitely give this place another try. Even if it just means ordering milkshakes and tater tots. (The tots are dynamite!)",

My brother and I had the salmon, my mom had the trout, and my dad went with the half rack of ribs. Everything was delicious. \n\nThe biggest gem of this place is the view!

I had to go find a spot up the road in a neighborhood. I sat at the bar and was greeted after I had to ask if I could eat food at the bar. They were friendly. You could tell they were busy and a bit of chaos trying to manage the lunch crowd yet the place was not packed. I ordered the chicken tacos and they arrived 25 minutes later. :( I kept checking in to see when it would be ready and they were apologetic and said soon. By the time I got them I had to run like a bat out of hell back to my car so I could get back to a class I needed to attend. Then I had to torture my classmates with the smell of amazing smoked chicken but apologized as I scarfed down my food in class. The chicken with corn and slaw fixins and tortilla was amazing. The other sides of slaw and potato salad was also yummy. Fix some of the lunch execution issues and this is a 5 star place to visit.",

I've traveled Spain and the rest of Europe, and my spawn has spent a significant time in Spain, and we both loved the Barcelona.\n\nIn fact, up to this point, the best tapas I have consumed were not actually in Spain, but Amsterdam at Joselito, where we were so enthused we ordered the entire menu.\n\nWith most small plates at Barcelona costing $5-$6, you can order a whole bunch of food to share and enjoy;  the also offer cooked to order paella, with the traditional rice base, and a variation featuring angel hair pasta.  They also have some entrees, and the whole menu is online.\n\nWe tried a variety of hot and cold tapas and loved them all.  My favorites were the ones featuring Jamon Serrano, and I liked his version of Patatas with aioli drizzle. \n\nIf you live in New Orleans, you'll find Barcelona a nice change.  You can linger and sample a variety of dishes. Great date nite place.  It's right behind the Walgreens on Carrolton.\n\nTourists can find the restaurant with a half block walk off the St. Charles streetcar, so when you get tired of deep fried seafood at high prices in the Quarter, hop on the street car and transport yourself temporarily to an evening in Spain.\n\nHe has an \"order slip\" at the table similar to the ones in sushi bars - just read the descriptions on the menu and check off your choices on the paper slip.",

I'm even more glad that they changed their menu up a little bit so that it's more casual-friendly and inviting to those who don't want to only eat here for special occasions. I came here for lunch one day with my mother. The waitress was super nice, it was great to have a nice view of the Delaware river and the lobster bisque was pretty decent. \n\nTheir vegetarian options are pretty lacking, however. The avocado and hummus wrap was just that - unseasoned and unimpressive hummus slathered with a bit of tomato and avocado. Nothing else. It was the epitome of boring. I couldn't finish it. Blaaah.

The kids were done around 6:15 and ready for games but we waited on Kenya to bring us the game cards for way too long.  When they finally got them it was almost too late. They did laser tag which was ok. That took a half hour to play for 8 minutes.  Then they tried to do go carts and they had one employee working the whole track. For every 15 minutes it took to load the kids got a three minute ride. Bad enough but the attendant let other groups cut in line again and again.  Finally, after waiting 30 minutes we had to leave. My kids were crying and it was a real mess because they did not get a turn and others kept cutting line.  It was surreal.  \n\nPlus, this place doesn't seem safe.

  "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, so I'm glad I got a chance to today. The location is prime and the actual decor space is lovely. The wait was only about 30 minutes which is pretty good for breakfast/brunch on a Saturday in Nashville. My friend and I both ordered the Not Bloody Mary which is their own house made Bloody Mary with cucumber and basil and their own tomatoes. Super refreshing but doesn't pair well if you get something sweet like the cinnamon roll or homemade biscuit with honey like we did. Those two items were SO good. The cinnamon roll wasn't too sweet or sticky, it was perfect. The biscuit was cooked perfectly and fell apart like it should have. Not dry at all and the honey to top it was incredible. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of our main meals. My friend got the TN Ham and apple sandwich, which didn't have much flavor and I think it's because he said he wanted it without the honey mustard and got mayo. Bad choice. I think it would've been better with the honey mustard. I got the Dirty Benny, which is essentially eggs Benedict but they use prosciutto and some kind of gravy. Way too salty for me with both the prosciutto and gravy together. The English muffin was also soggy and not crisp at all. But the home fries were soooo good. I love them. Super crisp and flavorful. \n\nI'd like to come back to this place and try something else, though. Definitely worth it!",

  "text": "My journey to find \"my\" brunch spot in St. Louis led me to Half & Half at the recommendation of a friend. It certainly will not be my last visit to Half & Half!\n\nAs others have said, there can be a wait, but as always, Yelp comes to rescue so take advantage and put your name on the list before you leave home. The hostesses left a little to be desired in the friendly, welcoming, customer service department but the waitstaff makes up for it. I can't remember my waitress' name (Mandy?) but she was absolutely the best and made sure our waters were always full. A difficult task when dining with my boyfriend who can easily drink, what feels like, a gallon of water over the course of a meal.\n\nI usually find it easy to narrow down my choices when looking at a typical breakfast/brunch menu. Half & Half's menu was a different story, everything sounded amazing. I settled on the Clara Cakes and my boyfriend went with the chorizo and guacamole benedict. But first! The doughnuts! Breakfast should always start with a doughnut appetizer. Honestly I would make a (not very balanced nor healthy) meal out of the doughnuts. The 3 pancakes are huge and fluffy. Sandwiched between is raspberry compote,  mascarpone cheese, and granola. The tartness of the raspberry compote helps balance the sweet of the mascarpone while the granola keeps it texturally interesting. My boyfriend devoured his chorizo benedict, kindly saving me a small bite of chorizo and potato. \n\nWill I be back? Absolutely! I'll order my own chorizo benedict next time!",

A waiter caught us on the way out and mentioned we should come in for brunch some time..its AYCD. So yes...I will be there!\n\nWe have come twice now, I however have ordered the same thing both times..the crab cake Benedict which is phenom. Portions are huge and it comes with a nice little salad on the side! My friends have been happy with the brunch burger but had a slippery experience with the pulled pork sandwich which was far too fatty. Their menu is pretty scant which is the only draw back in my book!\n\nThe deck is the place to be, great views with a nice breeze plus you can get a nice tan on a sunny day!! \n\nI've always had great service but if you're ready for a new bottle of champagne make sure you leave it out of the bucket so the servers can see!!!",

I understand the West Tower is somewhat nicer.\n\nIt appears the rooms were renovated in the last year or so as everything still looked fresh and shiny. Having said that, the rooms are not any better than your typical mid-range hotel or motel. Basically 2 beds, a bathroom, night stand, small table, and hutch with TV. Missing were coffee maker, not that I care but standard issue nowadays, and safe, also standard issue especially for a casino hotel. Housecleaning seemed to do a relatively perfunctory job, only making the bed, as the towels in the bathroom were still where I left them. I didn't eat or gamble there so I won't comment on those aspects. So basically a decent place to sleep and shower but not a place I would stay for an extended period of time.",

Then once we ordered the pork buns they weren't as good as expected. 2 for $10 and one of them had pork that wasn't even cooked the way. Too much bun and not enough filling. Then we thought they forgot to put our food order in because it was taking forever and the people next to us who were sat after got their food already. When the food finally came out (after we felt we were forgotten about) it smelled horrible, similar to a dumpster. We did not eat it and paid for our appetizer and left. Don't come here. Overpriced and horrible service. Not worth it when there's so many better restaurants to try in DTSP. We won't be back.",

I ordered the Traditional Acai Bowl, which at $8 a pop seemed pricey, but it was well worth it (and I've learned cheaper than most other spots). This stuff is addictive. A tasty concoction of acai berries, bananas, almond milk, strawberries, hemp granola, raw honey, and more freshly cut bananas. Delish! So filling and ridiculously healthy.

Located below the Hilton hotel, It's not right on the beach with a view but it's a close enough walk to the main pier and sand area. A plus is that it is not as touristy as the others and there was no wait on a Sunday evening . It seems more Mexican fusion with the surf and turf burrito and steak fajita ,but instead of red peppers there was tomatoes. I give it a four star because although service was friendly and fast ,we did not get any refills on our drinks and my fiancé usually drinks about 4 cups of soda with each sitting. The price is a little bit higher than original Frenchy's restaurant along the beach that we wanted to go to , that was worth not having to wait 45 minutes for a table however.",

Took quite a while to get our order in, but food came out quickly after that. Food was ok, nothing to write home about. Just felt bad for the couple servers we saw who were literally running back and forth trying to take care of everyone in their areas.",

  "text": "I've been to Metro in JAX once or twice and now this one twice.  I remember my trip to Jax fondly, even if I don't remember what I had, but my first trip to the St Pete location wasn't so great.  Okay, but not what I remembered.  I think I got a breakfast burrito, but since I can't remember, lets ignore that experience.  Besides, it seems to be the outlier.\n\nOn this trip - and I don't know what I was thinking - I ordered a breakfast pizza.  I'm kind of a healthy person - buffets and bacon aside, I work out and try to avoid too much carbs.  But here I was getting an easy 1000 calorie breakfast covered in pork and butter (which is all hollandaise sauce is made of).  And yes, 1000 calories of pork, carbs and butter sounds freaking amazing, but I'm usually better than that. But not this day.  This day, I was weak.  Fat and weak.\n\nSo what is a breakfast pizza?  Well, its dough - not sure pizza dough or what, but basically a flat round dough about the size of a personal pan pizza on steroids.  On top, they cover it in hollandaise like it was pizza sauce.  Then you get cheese, bacon, sausage, peppers, egg and more hollandaise, and I am pretty sure I am missing a topping or two.  It sounds like a lot.  I admittedly am the type of person to go full kitchen sink when I can - froyo?  Fill that cup with 6 different flavors and 5 toppings.  Buffet?  Mix at least 3 or 4 cuisines on a single plate and pile it layer upon layer.  However, even I can admit that when you do that, sometimes you lose any taste.  It just becomes a mess, and after I ordered the breakfast pizza, that is what I was expecting.\n\nWrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!  This was fantastic.  I mean, I felt so guilty after eating it, but this was delicious.  If I had one complaint, it would be that maybe it was too much hollandaise.  They could have done it like pizza sauce, or topped the whole thing, but doing both was a bit much.  Still, I was full after half of it and then practically swallowed the other half whole.  Great breakfast for the will-powered challenge or the more fatty inclined of you.  Basically, me.  Great breakfast for me.\n\nTaking a star off because (a) it was a bit heavy on hollandaise and (b) their coffee is weak as ... well, as weak as me when I ordered the breakfast pizza.  Shame, but you're a breakfast and brunch diner - you should have halfway decent coffee.\n\nNevertheless, I remain a fan of Metro Diner and the breakfast pizza.  Go on!  Be a glutton.  Be fat.  Be like Todd.  Enjoy a breakfast pizza.",

  "text": "How it has 4 stars is an absolute mystery. I, along with many people, was looking forward to a new casual spot in the village- and seafood to boot! For some reason a good, casual (or otherwise) restaurant is an obvious gap on a street 3 blocks from the ocean. Frankland's absolutely blew a golden opportunity. My first meal there I ordered local crab. Not much meat in there and no proper tools to appropriately extract the overpriced, poorly seasoned, crabmeat. Really, disappointing on all fronts. It was an utter mess. I grew up on the water  I know how it's done and this isn't it. It's as if they thought people (maybe because it's Montecito and people on vacation) would just roll over and pay the price. Fool me once... And almost twice. I went in this evening after a couple of months of driving by and seeing few, if no, people eating there, because I just really wanted to treat myself to  some crab legs but didn't want to drive the extra few minutes to the pier or East Beach. Lucky's, Honor Bar and others are packed, Frankland's is empty. I walk in and see Alaska crab legs 70-something dollars (20 less elsewhere) and not a soul to be seen in the kitchen or front register. If your struggling, make it easier, not harder for people to choose you. I waited a full minute, that's a long time when no one is in the restaurant. Last straw. I wanted to support them, I wanted them to succeed but you have to earn it with food and service, Frankland's has succeeded at neither.",

Every one knew the menu really well & answered all our questions well & honestly, which is what an indecisive gal like me loves! \nI forgot to take pictures of the appetizers, because we jumped right in, but we got the salmon tartine & the shrimp in muddy waters. Both were good, but didn't extremely excite me so, next time I would probably try something different!\n\nMy mom got the seared scallops on top of the fettuccine Nero, and oh my gosh talk about delicious. My mom loves scallops & gets them everywhere she can, and she said they were the best scallops she's ever had. I definitely agree! I'm not much of a fan of scallops but even I couldn't deny that they were delicious! The squid ink pasta was also delicious & the vermouth cream made it so decadent. I would definitely recommend the scallops. It's not a huge portion, but I think it would be perfect with an app or if you're not super hungry.\n\nI got the lamb shank. It was really good as well! The portion was big! I only ate half & the leftovers were just as good. It falls off the bone & I didn't even have to use a knife! I think it was just lacking some salt, which was a bummer. I don't think I would get this again either, mostly because I would love to try the rest of their menu. Or get the fettuccine Nero all for myself lol.\n\nWe also split a side of Brussels sprouts and OMG they're the best Brussels I've ever had!! I even ate some of them cold the next day & I still found myself saying \"I could eat these everyday\". They were delicious!! Get these!!! I can't stress that enough!\n\nFor dessert we got the goat cheesecake. It was good & light, which was great for us because we we already pretty full lol. I think I would try a different dessert next time too.\n\nBy far the highlight of our meal was the seared scallops & fettuccine and the Brussels sprouts!! Would highly recommend both!! \nAll in all it was a great meal. We'll definitely be back.",

My wife ordered avocado toast which she enjoyed very much.",

It took a long time for us to get our checks, that is the only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars. The food was amazing, some of the best seafood I've had in Indianapolis. I went with a couple friends and we visited during their happy hour. My friend and I shared the dragon shrimp, mango crab rangoon, blue balls and crispy rice cakes. I loved the mango crab rangoon and the blue balls, they were my favorite. The Blue Balls are tempura fried tofu pockets stuffed with spicy crab mix, served with eel sauce and they are delicious. I ordered the Lion King Roll, it was amazing. I will definitely be back!",

  "text": "awesome sashimi! awesome teriyaki!!\ntrumps my previous favorite in northern wilmington (le shio) - which is great because their other dinner dishes are very reasonably priced, and both food & service are better. \n\ngot the sashimi appetizer -  best sashimi i've had in wilmington. this is possibly the first time i really enjoyed cuts of sashimi other than tuna/salmon/hamachi outside japan. the fish had great texture and the taste was very fresh. it's like the chef's choice was actually great catch of the day instead of 'kitchen trickey to utilize scrap meat' (as the bang bang theory taught us)\n\nI rarely find myself impressed at teriyaki dishes, always thought of them as typical bento food, not bad, hard to mess up, but nothing to be excited about. the teriyaki here proved me wrong! they come on a sizzling platter, with piles and piles of meat! and what's more impressive is the bed of vegetable under the meat. I swear I perhaps liked beef flavored veggies (cabbage, bean sprouts, onions, pepper) more than meat itself. i've literally been eating what looks like garnish vegetables all night. so damn good! (it's like, better fajita) \n\nalso had their yakisoba. taste just like the ones we had in osaka. tho personally i recommand the teriyaki more. it's a little pricier but worth every penny!\n\nwe ended our meal with tempura ice cream. i've been having trouble finding these in delaware and so glad they have them! though i wish they had them with green tea or red bean ice cream instead of vanilla. nevertheless it was still very good. \n\ndefinitely will be back!!",

The sauce on the chicken parm had a little kick to it. just how I like it. And got a Caesar salad on the side for an extra $2.99. but the Caesar salad was small. Could have gave me a bigger salad, it's not your typical salad. most places that's much bigger and most of the lettuce in the salad Was chunks on the bottom. \n\nOverall everything was good. except the service could have been a little bit better. especially at the time I was there it was not that busy.",

There were 14 in our party, had a 730pm reservation and was seated at just before 8. Our server seemed overwhelmed and bit inexperienced on how to serve a group. Salads and appetizers were forgotten. When the manager came by and we mentioned the items missing he simply walked away without a word. Our server came right over, acted as if the items that were forgotten were our fault? but she would get them. I had the Cod and fries with Gorgonzola dipping sauce. Nothing special about my meal but the Gorgonzola sauce was late to the table, cold and way too salty. I had a bite of the crab Mac n Cheese and it was really good. The Thai pizza also looked delicious. The best part of the night were the Martinis- I ordered a huckleberry lemon drop and a mango pomegranate martini- both tasted amazing but both glasses were only half filled? If I pay $10 for a drink, I expect the entire drink.\nBottom line- only come for the Martinis, don't bring a large group and for the price you should eat elsewhere. Only reason I'd return would be for a Martini after a dinner/movie date.",

(I assume to give the false appearance to passersby that the place was busier than it actually was). One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant is empty and someone sits at the table next to me or the host puts me next to an occupied table. I don't want to hear the conversation from the table next to me. Give me some space!  There should be a minimum of one empty table between customers. I suppose I could've asked for a different table but I didn't want to inconvenience them. But I digress...\n\nStarted off with two types of bread and butter, which I really enjoyed. For my entree, I had the buttermilk fried chicken with sweet potatoes and collard greens. It was just OK to me. 3 stars.  Nothing more, nothing less. My friend had the quinoa with chicken, squash, beans, corn, etc. Equally unimpressed.  The daily soup was pretty good though.\n\nService was 2 stars. The server paid a lot more attention to the table that had ordered a bottle of wine. Bigger tip for him at that table since we just had waters, which I had to flag him down in order to get refills/check.  Took him awhile to come back to our table to take our order too. \n\nSkipped dessert since I wasn't impressed with my entree. I lean towards 2 stars instead of 3 since it didn't live up to expectations or the price point of the meal.",

There aren't very many topping options at all, for the poke or the burrito. Plus, the manager was kind of annoying the workers, which annoyed us. They had everything handled, but he'd rush over to them like they needed their hands to be held. Very invasive. The sushi burrito didn't quite taste right...like maybe it wasn't as fresh? Not sure. But I probably won't come back here...",

We went into the restaurant earlier this week and were impressed at how thought out the space was with cool posters on the ceiling, telephone poles protruding from the walls/ceiling, and just the overall vibe of the place. It is a long, narrow room but the seating was great for us to conduct a business meeting and enjoy lunch.",

Fish tacos usually have a bunch of slaw. These have only a hint, leaving room for fish. Lots of fish. I was a little too salty, but the sauce they use is slightly sweet. The other thing about these fish tacos is that they have cheese melted on them...CHEESE ON FISH! It totally works.\n\nThere's a lot said about their lobster roll. All the good stuff is true. Both rolls brought to our table were overflowing with. Lobster meat. Not a bunch of filler. Just lobster. And the roll is toasted to a crunchy golden brown. \n\nThe fries ARE along as a dollar bill, and fresh cut. They are also seasoned with old bay. Awesome!\nWe didn't have the onion rings but when an order was carried to the table next to us we knew we had missed something special. They were huge and they were battered in a tempura-type batter. \n\nThis place can seat 25 people inside and another 8 outside.",

As soon as I saw the spicy tuna, it was love at first sight. \n\nI got a brown rice bowl with spicy shoyu tuna and topped it with scallions, pickled ginger, house made eel sauce, sesame seeds and avocado. Holy moly. So delicious. The avocado was nice because it took a little of the heat off, not that I minded how spicy it was. (If you're not a spice lover, get the plain Shoyu Tuna.)\n\nMy boyfriend got the burrito with jasmine rice, nori, half shoyu/spicy tuna, kale, avocado and some other goodies. Also delicious. \n\nFresh fish - this is huge for me. The fish had zero odor and was a beautiful colour. My only constructive suggestions would be to possibly chop the tuna a little smaller. In Hawaii it's traditionally small cubes - these were bigger chunks. Just a personal preference I guess. And I would love if there were a cold sushi rice option, kind of like a chirashi bowl. Feels a little odd putting my fresh chilled tuna on a base of warm brown rice.\n\nDelicious. Will return. Maybe tomorrow. Highly recommend!",

I was surprised at how small the dining area was, but this is the case for a lot of small BYOBs in South Philly (maybe 24 seats tops?) The atmosphere is clean and homey, and the service is warm and welcoming. I came by with a friend who is a regular, but I don't think that we got any more special treatment than any of the other diners. Our server was awesome and super funny. For the table of three we shared:\n\nNyum La Hong, the green papaya salad, which we went for with medium spice, just trying to be cautious, but I think I definitely could've gone for spicy\nPrah Hok Kateeh, pork in coconut cream with fish sauce and tons of fresh veggies for scooping - this was like nothing I had ever tasted before and was a true highlight, as many of my fellow Yelpers have pointed out\nSah-Law Kah-Ree Mohn, curried chicken with lots of fresh veggies, especially celery, and rice\nCha Throp, purple eggplant with oyster sauce and we went with the pork option - this reminded me a lot of Thai sweet basil dishes I've had in the past and while it was tasty it was not the most unique in terms of our overall experience, but seriously it was tasty\n\nIf you've never had Cambodian before, I would say strongly that you should not hesitate to check Khmer Kitchen out. There is nothing intimidating about the experience even if you're a newbie, so expand your palette and hit up these folks ASAP.",

I have loved the food and two of the long-standing waitresses, however, in the last year, the quality of the food and service has drastically taken a nose dive.\nLast night I was dining with my parents and my 8 year old son.  As usual, we were browsing the menu and my son suddenly screeched and yelled \"Mom!  A cricket!\"  It wasn't a cricket - it was a cockroach.  I smashed it with my menu and it fell on to our table where I proceeded to conceal it in a napkin.  My dad asked that I not say anything or make a scene, so out of respect, I didn't, however, that bug was the last straw for me.  I will not be returning to this restaurant - I can deal with the occasional crappy service, but where there is one bug, somewhere nearby there are many.",

  "text": "I've been to tiramisu twice and was underwhelmed both times. The first time (lunch) we shared a pizza and salad. We asked for one of the other salad dressings to come with the salad instead of the one it's normally paired with, which the waitress said was fine, but it did not come with the dressing we requested. We also ordered a pizza specifically with the Peruvian peppers, but there were no peppers on the pizza let alone Peruvian ones. We then had to wait an obnoxiously long time to be able to cash out. The restaurant was not that busy.\n\nThe second time (dinner) we had to wait a solid 15 min from sitting down to someone coming to get our drink order. We decided to order everything right then so we wouldn't have to wait longer. Bread was brought out and it wasn't that good (needed salt or something, was really bland). We ordered the arancini (risotto balls) which were tasty but the marinara sauce that came with them was bland. My husband ordered the Salsicca pasta which came with Italian sausage, walnuts, sundried tomatoes and pasta. He enjoyed it. I ordered the carbonara with chicken. It was very bland, almost tasteless, and a few bites in I noticed uncooked gelatinous egg white everywhere which really nauseated me. I had to stop eating. \n\nWe got desert (still hungry after not being able to eat the carbonara!) - a raspberry mousse dome which was decent, and a cheesecake which was completely dry.\n\nDefinitely won't be coming back again.",

  "text": "I first visited Mi 'N Tea for a Yelp event about a year ago, and I thought it was great!  When I was in the area for a doctor's appointment last week, I thought it was the perfect time to swing by again for lunch.\n\nI ordered:\n\n-Thai Sunset:  This was thai tea, cream, and cold foam, and it was DELICIOUS.  I added boba which in hindsight I don't really think it needed.  I usually ask for teas half sweet but it slipped my mind while I was ordering.  I actually thought it was great as-is though.  It was definitely very sweet and creamy, but it made for a nice treat.\n\n-Viet Pork Skewers banh mi:  This was another home run.  The sandwich is pretty big and I was already getting full after the first half, but I kept eating it until I was done the whole thing because it was so good!  When you first unwrap the sandwich, it may look like it doesn't have that much filling, but that's just because the toppings are stuffed inside and the bread has an overhang.  If you look at the cross-section you will see there is plenty of goodness inside!\n\n-Taro Fries:  I love taro and I don't see it available much near me, so it was a no-brainer to add these fries on.  They were hot and crisp.  One thing I will say is that it seemed like the coating had a little sugar in it which I could have done without, but it was balanced out by dipping in the side of spicy mayo.  Note you could also get spicy kethcup instead of mayo if you prefered.\n\nService was great - everyone was really nice and they brought my tea out first while I was waiting for the rest of my order.  I definitely recommened Mi 'N Tea and hope to be back soon!",

  "text": "Friday night, we were finally able to give Hedge Row a full test. We had been there only for a mid-day snack and that was not enough fully to review. It must be pointed out that Chef Brad Gates is the real deal. He was Union Square's chef de cuisine for 10 years. Also, this restaurant is focused on wood roasting and locally sourcing (to the extent possible). So, for example, some of the veggies came from Silverthorn Farms (one of our favorites). Friday night, we were with four other people and everyone at the table was willing to share. Accordingly, we got lots of different tastes. It was the unanimous judgment of each of us that everything we tasted was excellent! We started with the shrimp hush puppies, wood roasted carrots and wood roasted beets. We had enjoyed the shrimp hush puppies before (on our mid-day snack) and, as before, they were truly delicious. The wood roasting gave the carrots and the beets a lovely flavor. On Chef's recommendation, we moved to the lamb meatballs and each of us enjoyed one. The lamb came from Viking Farms. The flavors in them were extraordinary and were we not saving room for other tastes, we could each have handled more. Next we went to the mains and four were ordered that were shared six ways: the half chicken (Gunthorp Farms), trout (Rushing Waters), salmon (Skuna Bay, Canada) and the pasta with veal bolognese. Jacque Pepin, in a cooking class, had told my spouse that roast chicken is the test for a good chef. It seems so simple, but to do it right is really difficult. Hedge Row DID IT RIGHT! The difficult trick is keeping the breast moist while cooking the thigh fully. Our half chicken was just outstanding. The breast was still moist and not dried out and the dark meat was perfectly cooked. For us, the test on trout is whether the skin is crispy and the trout not overdone. The sauce for the trout included a hint of ginger which gave it an unusual flavor which we all enjoyed. Again, Hedge Row passed with flying colors. The trick on salmon is getting it done enough without overcooking and, once again, the salmon was just done enough. It's accompaniment was Asian in flavor and complemented it very well. It should be noted that with each of these dishes, there is no place to hide mistakes. And there were none that had to be hidden. It is possible that the pasta bolognese is a bit more forgiving, but here the question is the flavor of the veal bolognese (outstanding), the amount of sauce (excellent - not over sauced, a common error) and proper cooking of the pasta. Again, a dish that we all enjoyed. Finally, four of us went off menu for our dessert, ordering either the chocolate or vanilla ice cream and a shot of espresso we could pour over (for our own affagatos). Two of our number ordered the sticky toffee pudding (a mainstay of the lamented R Bistro). The pud was wonderful and our affagatos were just the right, light end to the meal. We paired the first part of the meal with a lovely mid-coast California rose (which was dry and fruit forward). The last half or the meal, I chose a Barbera d'Alba which was a light enough red to go with everything. So our bottom line is whether a restaurant will make our regular rotation. This one definitely is going into the rotation.",

For me, that's perfect because I'm not a fan of spicy flavors but if you're expecting a jalpeno-hot sauce scolding bite than you might want to ask your waitress to tell the chef to make them super spicy.

  "text": "Lucas Park Grille is a somewhat upscale restaurant.  I say this based solely on menu prices and not food quality.  I spent more than $50 on dinner and after I was finished, I concluded that I have eaten better tasting food at Crapplebees.  It's not revoltingly bad or anything, just bland and tasteless.  The service is friendly enough and I do stop in for drinks from time to time.  It gets too crowded on Friday and Saturday for my liking, but that's more of a personal preference than a critique of the business.  \n\nIn all, if you're going to Lucas Park Grille, I would suggest it for drinks only.  There are much better restaurants in the area.",

  "text": "My visit to Jonathan's Grille was the worst dining experience I have ever endured. An hour after being seated we still had only water to drink. Several of us had ordered the featured bourbon, but were finally informed they were out of stock. The rest of our drink orders were simply not completed until later in the evening. After inquiring as to where our waiter was, they finally began taking our meal orders over an hour after our arrival. Prior to ordering our meal, we were informed they were out of baked potatoes. Really? How does a restaurant allow itself to run out of baked potatoes? Half our appetizers were never delivered to the table. Several times while we waited they came to our table to tell us they were out of yet another item we had ordered. After our meals were finally delivered to the table almost two hours after we were seated, the waiter told one in our party that he would have to order something else. They had just discovered they were out of his order after everyone else finally had their meal in front of them. At that point he did not feel inclined to reorder and decided to pick up a pizza on the way home. The rest of us felt quite uncomfortable eating our meal while one in our party went without. The food was average, but expensive. However, the reason we considered cancelling our orders and going elsewhere was the attitude of the wait staff towards several members of our party. Probably the most egregious example was when we shared with the waiter that two in our party were recently engaged. His response was a sarcastic \"Congratulations\" to the bride-to-be and \"So sorry\" to the gentleman. No one at the table was amused. Another waiter asked, \"How is your meal?\"....before anyone at our table had been served. We left wondering why any establishment would treat their guests in such an abusive manner. Never again.",

  "text": "I love Starbucks coffee. I love the way it tastes and I love the way it smells. But, they are NOT all the same. Some are consistently good and some are flops. This one is one of the best. Take this morning, for instance. I had a nice conversation with the very personable lady at the counter regarding our kids. (She showed me a pic of one her sons - pulled it out of her apron pocket - love that!) Then I waited for my decaf frappucino. The girl making the drink put one down only it was slightly wrong (caramel instead of coffee) so she took it back and tried again. Evidently, she wasn't able to get it right so she had the guy working there do it. The guy made it (and it was perfection, btw - so many places don't know to blend the ice until smooth and you end up with ice chunks blocking your straw) and I thanked him and was just about on my way when the girl who had tried making it let me know she had comped my drink since it took a little long. Wait? What? I wasn't even upset about it nor did I complain and they took it upon themselves to comp my drink? In the words of DJ Lance Rock on Yo Gabba Gabba, \"That was Awwwwesommmmme!\" Seriously, most places don't do anything to correct wrongs unless you complain. This was sincerely most appreciated and it dawned on me that I have always gotten primo service at this particular Starbucks. Bravo!",

I would recommend reservations.  However, if you do not make them and they are full...the bar area is lively and fun and you can either wait  there and have a drink or eat there.  The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail is a must.  I love spicy and boy did it clear out the sinuses.  I thought another person in our party was going to fall over it was so hot for them.  Side note...you can buy the cocktail sauce in a bottle from the restaurant.  Every one in our party got a steak.  The ribeye was wonderful and melted in your mouth.  A buddy gave the filet the same review.  Each steak came with a side and a soup.  I had the lobster bisque...so chunky with large lobster pieces I didn't know what i was eating...again it was great.  I had the mashed potatoes as a side...pretty good as well.  The meal was so filling...would go back often if I could.  As an added side note...the Dalai Lama was also dining at St. Elmo's the night we were there...very cool.  He would not steer you wrong!!  Check it out!",

Fell in love with the \"buy the farm\" burger and crave it (we live out of town).  Both times I got it lately, the burger seemed slapped together with hardly any relish  - half the bun was dry, and off center egg, lettuce and tomato.  Their small rectangular plates are awful, especially with a messy, large burger to wrangle in a 4x4 space.  Their portions are fine, why the tiny plate?  \nThey were out of  EINSTÖK, so I tried the Gerst which was happy hour price.  It was ok.  My last visit, I forgot what I got, but they had just opened a new keg, and my glass was the first one off with about a 4 inch head.  \nThe thrill is gone.  Pie In The Sky pizza a few doors down with great pizza, pasta etc will be getting more $$$.  Sorry BR, gotta step it up.",

They still tasted good even 48 hours later, whereas I've found most other donuts are stale within a few hours.\n\nIf you've had the vegan donuts at places like Donut Friend or Donatsu in LA, or Glam Doll in Minneapolis, expect similar quality at Dottie's. \n\nAlso, Dottie's is way better than famous (but mediocre) places like Voodoo Donuts, Mighty-O and Dun-well in Portland, Seattle and NYC, respectively.",

Very friendly staff. Do not expect to have a skinny rigatoni like those from the box. This rigatoni is giant, cooked in perfection.

  "text": "We have ordered a number of times through Grub Hub. Mainly because until recently, there weren't many choices for delivery. Their food is good, although it all seems to be pre packaged food. They have done something a few months back changing the way they made items, and not for the better. My biggest complaint has been their lack of attention to detail. They often mess up orders or forget items. Depending on who is working there, they will either fix the problem for you or tell you they don't have time to replace your food even though it was their mistake. Used their coupon once for free kids meal. They left out almost all the \"meal\" and when I called they said they wouldn't bring me the fries or sauce for the chicken because I got it free anyway.",

Along with our happy hour drinks of course, which bang for your buck you can't beat. Then afterwards a girlfriend and i shared the lobster special. A huge, tender, delicious, meaty lobster for 30 bucks! It was a great deal and the best meal I've eaten in a long time.

My fiance and I spent the better part of the afternoon just hanging out at Sevtap and the pours just kept coming...\n\nI wish I could name one wine that was my favorite, but honestly I can't. They are all outstanding. I could just swish and smell them all for hours, that's how good they are -before you even taste them! \n\nWe were so impressed by his blends and asking about his next batch of varieties for 2014 (which will include a Malbec and a Sangiovese) that he invited us to this warehouse the next day for a barrel tasting! It was amazing!!! \n\nI can't wait to come back to Solvang and visit Arturo Sevtap! \n\nIf you're into wines and looking for the best in the area then you MUST stop in at Sevtap! It's a taste sensation in all capacities. Do not miss out!",

Happy hour has great potential if they can remember to actually bring out the food you actually order. I ordered the catfish basket, buffalo shrimp, and fried okra. I never received the fried okra. The catfish wasn't catfish, more like a whitefish and it was super salty. We also ordered drinks and hookah. The frozen drinks are super weak and were not my favorite. I would really like them to add dividers to booths, don't sit different parties close together, revamp the drinks, and up their customer service skills before I decide to go back. Until then, they should take the 18% gratuity off the tabs because they are definitely not deserving of it.",

  "text": "I had bookmarked this restaurant when we were heading to Vegas but didn't have a chance to check it out.  Since we were heading to Reno, I was ecstatic that they have a location here.  This restaurant is located inside of Harrah's which is close to our hotel so we just walked over. We came here for brunch and for the 5 (3 adults & 2 kids) of us, we ordered 3 regular entrees plus 1 kid's meal.  When our food arrived, we realized that we ordered way too much food.  We ended up taking leftovers back to the hotel and eating them for breakfast the next day.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5...the host did not acknowledge us when we approached him.  He just kept staring at us.  We waited a while before he even talked to us.  It was between 10-11am so at that time, it wasn't even busy.  Also, the breading on the chicken and the pork chop pretty much just crumbled off of the meat and left crumbs all over the plate.  The infamous sage fried chicken with waffles (with bacon) didn't have any sage flavor at all but the chicken and the waffles were good.  The pork chop entree had mashed potatoes and a biscuit underneath the pork chop but since the sauce was served on top of the pork chop, everything underneath was pretty bland.  The other 2 entrees we ordered were just the typical pancake meals so no comment on those.",

I managed to figure it out quickly though, and I found my way through the bustling herd of customers shuffling around looking for a table or getting drinks or whatever they were doing to the cashier to place my order. I was sort of having a low blood sugar moment, so my brain wasn't processing the menu - I asked him if I could just get a turkey sandwich. Then he asked me 20 questions which I did my best to answer. He handed me a number and some chips and a cup and sent me on my way... \n\nI joined the herd and found a table and got my drink and started snacking on my chips They were almost gone before my sandwich arrived. My sandwich was delicious, but a little dry (I guess that's kinda my fault because I don't like mayo on sandwiches, but the pesto they put on it wasn't enough to overcome the dryness of the turkey). It was flavorful and the bread was tasty. I wish there was one in Phoenix. I would eat there a bunch.",

Which means the margin of error for toppings and such is almost NIL. Also, no stink eye when you order 12 toppings, lol.  Do that at a regular pizza place!\nThe crust is amazing, not the typical dough pizza we get her in the Philly area.  Toppings are FRESH - and so incredibly tasty compared to a 'regular' pizza place.\nI get there on time and go right to pick-up because it is already paid for. So easy!\nThe manager (Ryan I think) is really nice and friendly at each pick-up. I've never seen a mess in this store, behind the counter is always clean, even during the rushes.\nCan't recommend this pizza place more.  \nAnd a bonus, there is a Mod Pizza where one of my daughters lives in another state.  I can order on-line for them and have her pick it up as a surprise for an easy dinner for them - I really like I can do that.\nI wish there was a Mod Pizza in every location my adult children live, it is so fun to call after ordering and saying 'Hey - can you add a note to the top of the box for my daughter' and they do!",

  "text": "I was torn between rating PF Changs 3 or 4 stars.  The food is good, but it's a far cry from real Chinese food. The service varies depending on the server... We've had great service, horrible service, and a lot in-between. The cocktails are horribly overpriced so my husband and I normally just order a pot of hot tea, which is incredible. Since we live close by we typically grab our food to-go in the curbside pick up area.\n\nThis P.F. Changs is located at the Westshore mall so it's always packed. I'd highly recommend making dinner reservations on Friday and Saturday nights because it can be at least a 30 to 45 minute wait after 7pm. The bathroom is poorly located next to the bar so you have to fight a crowd every time you want to go to the bathroom.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the food is tasty; just not authentic. The lettuce wraps and dumplings are two of my favorite appetizers on the menu. There are many mild and spicy dishes on the menu depending on your spice preferences. We enjoy a lot of spice so we usually order the spicy green beans and the Cho's Spicy Chicken. The honey glazed chicken and the wonton soup are also quite good.\n\nI have never ordered dessert here, but I have tried a handful of the cocktails and they are usually too sweet and fruity for my taste. Be cautious of ordering cocktails that aren't listed on the menu. The bartenders have disappointed me on numerous occasions with poorly made Dirty Martinis and Cosmos.\n\nAll in all PF Changs is nothing special, but the food is consistent so you are guaranteed a decent meal.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I just finished our meal here. The food was quite good, in particular the broccoli appetizer we shared and the fennel sausage pasta I had as a main stood out.\n\nHowever. And a big however. \n\nOur post dinner coffee had just arrived and after we handed off the checkbook with a generous tip, our server returned to inform us that the next party was waiting for our table. In the moment it wasn't too strange, but after she walked away I realized we both had just been served cortados and had each only had a sip, not to mention we both had full glasses of wine. It was a Friday night dinner and we had only been there for an hour and fourty five minutes, which for a coursed meal seemed reasonable if not short. We both immediately felt rushed and did as we were asked, quickly drank our coffee and wine and left, though my girlfriend did ask the server what time the reservation was for the party waiting on our table, which was 7:45, basically giving an airtight window for serving us (our reservation was for 6).\n\nIf I read this review, I would likely be focused more on the food reviews and less on the service, which is entirely fair. But when you eat at a place that is supposed to be contending with top restaurants in the city it diminishes the experience when the last experience is being rushed off immediately after paying the check. Had we any forewarning we might not have had coffee, or skipped the appetizers. I know the poor scheduling is not the fault of our server, but she kept us in the dark and only informed us after we had paid the check which, whether intentional or not, made us feel a little conned.\n\nThis place has a tremendous reputation, and for almost all of our meal, that lived up. But being young and having too many friends in service (also my girlfriend who ate with me worked in service for years), the service tonight was downright deceptive. We spent too much time talking to our server about food for her to tell us we needed to hurry up as we handed her cash (literally what happened).\n\nFor now: Res Ipsa delivers well enough on food and the small atmosphere of a traditional byob. But the service is well below the cost. Not only were we hurried, the party taking our seat had no room to wait comfortably and were forced to stand in the doorway while we chugged our coffee and wine. It was probably the most awkward experience I've had at a restaurant, and for that I can only give them 2 stars.",

Wouldn't really call it great, you can get better burgers elsewhere. In my opinion, this place is overrated. The restaurant itself is very crammed. Way too much going on in a small space. We could barely hear our waiter due to the fact that tables were so close together and crammed, so overall the place seemed very loud because of other conversations going on around us. Wouldn't consider going back.",

Their breading is a little thicker but gives it an amazing crunch that you'll quickly learn to love.  Always moist and juicy, this place has it all.  You can even have craw-fish, shrimp, or fish if you want to keep with the seafood theme of the New Orleans coast, but this place is known for it's great fried chicken.   You'll be amongst a lot of tourists in this establishment, but this is one of those places where the locals come even though they're surrounded by the \"visitors\".  All in all, if you like chicken, this should be on your stop to New Orleans.",

I popped in here with my stroller (the ramp is super helpful for this!). Their coffee menu is impressive as is their machinery. I almost went with the Dirty Hippie (chai tea + espresso) but went with an Iced Latte on a lark. It was SO delicious and refreshing. I usually don't finish all of my coffee drinks, but I slurped up all of this yummy treat. The fun twisty straw was a bonus! \n\nI also ordered a turkey panini with a side of cottage cheese for some nosh and it was very good. Sliced turkey deli meat, avocado, herby mayo, tomato on crispy wheat bread made this sandwich one to remember!\n\nI loved sitting out on their patio, cooling off, enjoying my meal and catching the sights of mid-morning Broad Ripple. It made for a very pleasant morning. I am not sure WHY it took me so long to visit, but I am so glad I did; and I'll definitely be back!",

  "text": "While North is no longer owned by Fox Restaurant Concepts, they've maintained their formula/consistency, which is what I always appreciated  about  FRC restaurants. Knowing what to expect is nice, even for takeout the food is a-ok. I still have not dined inside of a restaurant but continue to support with takeout. We ordered online on a Saturday evening, the wait was about 35 minutes. They did not offer curbside pickup but I am sure it they would gladly accommodate the request. Our order included the calamari, meatballs, braised  short rib with polenta and the branzino. The meatballs and braised short rib are always good. The branzino was a touch overcooked but still good. And the calamar I think it best enjoyed at the establishment since it's fried. \n\nIf you are comfortable with dining in, North is open for both indoor and outdoor dining. \n\nThey are adhering to the Pima County guidelines regarding COVID19.",

From the cheese fondue appetizer (I have only had the cheddar), to the entrée (we get the you pick 3), and when there's room to finish off with dessert (yummy flaming turtle) it is simple heaven. Just imagine fruits, little bite size cakes and bite size rice crispy treats all for your dipping pleasure into delicious melted chocolate of your choosing (there are a lot of choices from dark to milk to white to mixed). If you have not been here yet, I highly recommend you try it. Even if you only go for the dessert, that alone is worth the trip!",
