The quinoa bowl was deliscious, just don't forget to add avocado. If you are lucky Mason will sing for you! Oh and this place has Matcha Green Tea and they know how to properly prepare a straight cup of matcha. A true blessing for matcha lovers.",

  "text": "I wouldn't say this is the best Sally's in the area, but it's literally like five minutes away from my house. It's a great place to pick up hairdye and knick knacks.\n\nThey offer a membership for 5 dollars that you will get much more in return. You get a membership pricing on certain items and some gifts on certain occasions when you spend a certain amount.\n\nThey have a website too for what you can not find in stores. The workers are usually helpful the times I went. The last time the girl offered assistance on picking up colors for my mom and I. I felt she was off on my mom's color a bit, but nothing I couldn't fix up.\n\nI love picking up haircare products from here, but do be careful. I feel some of the products might be a little too old. I had gone to Cali and picked up a bottle of styling product but left it in Cali when I left. So I went to the Sally's back home and picked up the same bottle but the product wasn't clear like the other one. It turned out to be a really nasty yellow color. I wasn't sure if the product was bad or if that's how it was suppose to be.\n\nSo I'm going to be a little more cautious picking up some of their generic brands. I do however love picking up their deep conditioning packets that are almost always on sale for .99cents. Great for if you're always dying your hair!\n\nThey have tons of products for your nails, hair to do extensions, accessories for hair, and appliances. You might get a good deal here than you would other places on appliances. So it doesn't hurt to check in to see if you can pick up something here than running to the nearest Utla.",

  "text": "Had to go the tourist route and get a cheese streak while in Philly. The hype is well deserved. I loved the sandwich and I'm not a cheese whiz fan but I didn't want to alter the meal. I was not disappointed at all. The food was good, service was quick, price was reasonable and I left there stuffed. I had a mushroom cheese steak and a bottle of water because it was a hot day. I'll try the fries next time because I plan to go back with no hesitation. The area was clean, parking is a challenge but if u get off the beaten path and park in the residential area and walk a block or two you'll be fine. Car was safe no issues or alarming concerns. I love the way both legendary restaurants are in the same area and they are both prosperous. A little friendly competition goes a long way and they have it down to an art. Just think they need to accept credit and debit cards in this day and age. The sandwich was $12 and that's a reasonable amount to use a card for your purchase.",

That's a pretty high bar of expectation to set, but wooooow... yeah, I loved it. \n\nJoe's is located right on main street in Carmel, so you can't miss it. Stop in for a wide variety of spices, sauce, frozen meals, wine, sandwiches -- and obviously, meat. \n\nFor lunch I've opted for the BLT twice and the Cuban once. Both were delicious, but they really do work some magic on the BLT. It only takes about 5 minutes for them to make it, and the staff is very friendly. \n\nBe sure to grab a small bag of Broad Ripple Chip Co with your sandwich... and definitely, opt for the BLT.",

  "text": "I love this place so much that I don't even know where to begin this review.  I have dined or had drinks here at least 25 times over the last five years.  I have never had a less than perfect experience or less than perfect meal.\n     Starting with the atmosphere, what can I say that has not been said before?  The place is gorgeous, no really.... it is stunning.  The old converted church is lovely in every possible way and exudes charm from every corner both inside & out.\n     This is an elegant establishment and I just don't think we have enough of those in a world that is becoming ever more casual.  Check in with the host, check your coat and hang out at the bar.  They have a nice wine list that will surely have something for your enjoyment.  The bartenders have been the same for years & will create some of the finest cocktails in New Hope - I recommend the classic Martini.  The host will come get you when your table is ready and whisk you away to a romantic dining room on the second floor.  Look around as you climb the stairs, there is a lot to see in this beautiful old church.  \n     The grand dining room is large, complete with stunning art and magnificently high ceilings.  The tables for couples will be adorned with red rose petals.  \n     The food has always been exceptional, understand it is Southern cooking, Creole to be exact - lots of seafood, lots of classics such as jambalaya & gumbo.  The fresh French baguette they bring over is always warm, flakey in the outside and delicate on the inside.  The service has never been less than five stars.  I always like a little banter with whomever is serving and my last experience here was no exception.  Our server both entertained us with his quick wit and informed us about everything we considered on the menu.\n    We both ordered the beet salad with spinach & goat cheese as our starter and as a vegetarian I got the Eggplant Napoleon as my meal.  Creamy, buttery, fresh, flavorful with just the right spice to make an impression - delicious!!!  Naturally dessert had to be ordered and I got the carrot cake, be warned - it is a very large piece and is served with a scoop of homemade ice cream.  I couldn't finish the whole thing & I never leave dessert unfinished on my plate.  \n     As I said at the start, I have never had less than a five star experience at Marsha Brown's and will be back again in a few weeks.",

  "text": "This store is definitely a store for high schoolers who need books off their book list for the semester. (They also have a used book section that is quite limited - more mystery and romance books than straight up lit.) The books are organized just like the bookstore I used to grab books at when I was a high school student. I still would have bought a book anyway (some books that high school students are assigned are great books! Amerika by Kafka? Never read it. Should read it.), BUT they are cash only! At a book store!! Where a typical purchase is probably more than $10! But cash only. So I put my books back, apologized for not having cash, and walked out (probably never to return). If you're a high school student near Franklin or a parent of such a student, this store is probably great (so long as you have cash on you), but for regular readers/book lovers, it's not a great store. B&N in Cool Springs or Landmark Booksellers are probably better options.",

  "text": "Great diner-esque food with a huge pastry bakery case up front. My friend and I were getting hungry and I've seen signs all over for Ponzio's and thought it would be a great time to check it out.\n\nOur first server was a little..odd. But she had to leave half-way through and the next server was ok, but she was semi staring at us once in awhile. This was about 5pm on a Saturday and it was packed. \n\nTo start out, the green bean fries were tasty and the philly cheesesteak spring rolls were super hot, crispy and flavorful. Being as hungry as I was, and knowing I can't actually eat that much I wanted something I could easily heat up the next day as well. Answer- chicken parm with a side of angel hair pasta. Huge portion! Everything was cooked perfectly with a really nice tomato sauce. My friend got a Reuben and loved every bite.  \n\nThe menu was large with a copious amount of options. I was deciding between shrimp scampi, strip steak, blackened chicken wrap.. I was on the point of being hangry, but the chicken parm hit the spot.",

  "text": "When I go on vacation, I like to treat myself like it's my birthday!\n\nFirst step - Make A Reservation! \n\nThis place fills up fast and they will send you reminder text too. I know this is seafood in Nashville but it was literally the best food experience I had while visiting. \n\nMy friend and I arrived from a long flight from NY and had a couple cocktails at Skull's Raimnbow Room before heading over. Yet, Maci our waitress, sold me on this gin, blueberry, egg white cocktail, called Negative Space. Mind Blowing! It's like this girl could read my mind. I am a sucker for gin and egg white cocktail. I could not have been happier. \n\nThe restaurant itself felt modern, clean and spacious. I like to not be elbow to elbow when I am splurging on a meal. \n\nWe started with a dozen oysters. The oyster menu was perfect. It explained the flavor notes for each, of course some of the obscure ones were sold out. Our dinner was pretty late. I would say come as early as you can for the full menu. Also remember to check the boxes for mignonettesauce, horseradish, cocktail sauce and lemon. This was the best way to start the meal. \n\nThey suggested 4-5 plates to share. We ordered 4 after the oysters and it was a lot. But happy we got to try so many of the dishes. \n\nPoppy's Caviar - was a delicious and light dish \nOctopus salad - So good with the grapes, avocado and crunchy pepitas\nCrab Dip -  A really meaty one of the dishes, rich and comforting. Loved the cast iron skillet it was served in\nSmoked Trout - a lovely layering of flavors. With the potatoes it became a lot heavier too\n\nWe ended up taking some of the crab dip and smoked trout home and it made for the perfect morning chilled breakfast. \n\nThanks to our lovely waitress for helping us through the menu and making our experience so enjoyable. I have been singing your praises Henrietta Red, until we meet again!",

  "text": "After ten years as Executive Chef for the Century Hospitality Group, Chef Paul Shufelt decided it was time to start up a restaurant of his own. The Workshop Eatery officially opened a couple weeks ago in The Mosaic Centre, Canada's largest net-zero commercial building. Choosing to open up in a sustainable building definitely poses its challenges, but supporting local producers, sustainability, and using seasonal produce are concepts important to Chef Paul. \n\nThe Workshop Eatery is located in the far south neighborhood of Summerside, which can be a fair drive for many in Edmonton. But once you enter the building you're greeted by an open space and living wall, which shows how unique and beautiful the Mosaic Centre really is. As for the restaurant, you're greeted into a space that is warm, rustic and inviting. I love the open concept and the visibility of the kitchen - there's nothing to hide! \n\nThroughout the different seasons, the menu will consist of roughly 20 staple dishes and a different feature each day. What makes the menu seasonal will be the different accompaniments and sides to a main dish. If you're ever wondering what's on the menu on a particular day, just check the website! It's amazing that they will be updating their online menu daily! \n\nWe started off our meal with a couple of appetizers, first up was the Arancini ($12). The arancini at Workshop changes daily, and the \"New York Deli\" arancini with deli meats, a balsamic tomato smear, and Nefiss Lazizz Olive Oil was the feature for the day. These fried risotto balls had a golden, crisp exterior, and broke open to reveal a creamy mix of risotto, green peas, and small morsels of meat. I personally prefer my arancini to be rich and cheesy, so these arancini didn't quite deliver for me. \n\nNext up came the Chicken Liver Parfait ($11) served in a small mason jar with crostinis made from Bon Ton Bakery's Cranberry Raisin Nut Bread. The liver was whipped with a mousse-like texture and topped with a port and Saskatoon berry jam. It was a perfect balance between sweet and savoury, and I loved the different textures that the crostini added to the mixture.\n\nOur last starter for the meal was the Duck Carpaccio ($17) featuring Moosewood Acres cured duck breast, pickled shiitakes, carrots, daikon, a soy reduction and blood orange vinaigrette. I really enjoyed the fragrant orange paired with the duck, and the tang of the vinaigrette, but found that the dish was much too salty. Typically a carpaccio dish features meat that is extremely thinly sliced or pounded thin, but the duck in this carpaccio was thickly sliced. The thick slice combined with the soy reduction was quite salty, so with some adjustments to the cut and seasoning, I would really enjoy this dish!\n\nJust like the arancini, The Workshop Eatery has a feature dish each evening. On the night of our visit Tangle Ridge Lamb Chops were being served with a butternut squash, corn and bacon hash. The lamb chops were moist and tender, and looked beautiful against the brightly coloured hash. The hash itself was naturally sweet but lacking in smokiness which we expected from the bacon. As it turns out, we didn't find much bacon in the hash either, so that could have accounted for the discrepancy. \n\nFor myself I ordered the Duck Duck Couscous (how fun is that to say?!) ($32) which featured beautifully seared Moosewood Acres duck breast on a bed of warm couscous with raisins, almonds, pickled cherries and vanilla parsnip puree. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium, and the lightly sweet couscous was a great companion to the duck. The parsnip puree was also a delightful addition to the dish, and complemented both components on the plate. Although I love lamb, the duck was definitely the winner for me and I would happily order it again. \n\nWhen it came down to the desserts, I was torn between two options. The panna cotta at The Workshop Eatery is made with the rooftop honey and would have been my first choice, but I couldn't resist the Croissant Bread Pudding ($9). The flaky croissant pieces are paired with white chocolate and cranberry, giving this dessert some tart notes to balance the sweet. Topped with a generous scoop of Pinocchio's cinnamon ice cream, this was a comforting dessert that I would eat again. \n\nTaken as a whole, we had a great dinner at The Workshop Eatery: our dishes were good and the service was attentive. If there's one thing I love about The Workshop Eatery, it's their commitment to sustainability and supporting local producers. Their decision to move into the Mosaic Centre means that the drive to their restaurant is long and far for many patrons, but the principles of the building align with the values of the restaurant. It's great to see so many local farmers mentioned throughout the menu, and I think it will be interesting to see how things shift once the growing season in Edmonton comes around.",

Our server was a young man named Paul, I like him because he went out of his way to make sure that my wife and daughter were taken care of with their orders from beginning to end. When he initially came over to introduce himself and take our drink order, he knelt right beside me and my daughter looked at me and asked/stated... \"Daddy, your face is saying that he committed a Man-Law Violation?! Yes, yes he did... much too close. But no points are deducted when a person is giving great hospitality and service.  Makes me wonder if everything really is BIGGER in Texas.\n\n\nLet's see how the main coarse goes... 45 minutes later... So I had a 16oz sirloin and it melted like butter! Great steak! The house steak sauce was another story altogether... watered down, very bland and not a good pairing for such an amazing steak. Thanks once again to Paul for rescuing a choice steak with a bottle of A1 steak sauce.\n\nOur appetizers were great as well, thanks Paul for the suggestion of a \"Triple Treat\" Potato skins, fried pickles (Amanda's favorite) and buffalo wings. My daughter loved her baked potato but was a title puzzled by the chicken tenders because they looked more like chicken nuggets.\n\nOverall, great Job Paul! We live closer to the Wesley Chapel location but this was a great fill-in spot.",

Please don't walk in asking for your favorite craft beer...\nPeople sitting at the bar and tables telling the same stories you've might have heard the last time you were there... But it's still entertaining.. \nA jukebox full of good music.. and a kitchen in the back that I've heard have some really good food, although I can't confirm it.. Apparently lunchtime opening isn't an option.. \nBring a few bucks.. Say hello to Jasmine the bartender. She was pretty pleasant and attentive. and enjoy.. Bars like these are fading and you'll miss them when they're gone..\nUYE anyone??\nBut first, somebody send an I Love Yelp sticker to put on this bar's door..",

  "text": "There's something about thrifting and finding treasures that gives me goosebumps! The thrill of finding the hidden treasure is hard to explain unless you yourself are avid thrifter, a dumpster diver and a price checker! \n\nI had bookmarked my stops before traveling to Northern Liberties. And Once Worn was definitely in the to do list. As I walked up I could see a SALE rack! Those discounted racks can be the quick fix for sure. It  was my lucky day. I saw it hidden...it was a ..Catherine Malandrino dress!!! Wow! And in black! I tried to contain my glee for the true test. \n\nThen....dun dun dun...dressing room! The place that is the true decisions maker in my book.  I closed the curtain and the clerk remarked the Velcro that connects the curtain to the wall. Brilliant! I hate it when there's a little gap and people can see in. And then when I slipped the dress on..it was easily a Va-Va-Voom dress!! Fit like a glove! And I have to wear black at work some days. It was also work appropriate, flattering and feminine. There was black on black leopard pattern in the front section down. Gorgeous. \n\nI felt the need to pay and try to not tempt myself to buy the whole store. The clerk and I chatted for like 15 minutes! She was a total sweetheart! \n\nI had so much fun I told my friend who's into vintage to check it out! And from what I hear she made out like a bandit! Lulu Guinness was amongst the loot. Another one of my faves! This place is on my list for all future visits!! And I almost wanted to not review and keep it alllllll to myself but I'm too nice! Enjoy and find some treasures!",

When you walk in the door there is a table right in front of you, and it seems that the entrance area could get very crowded and confusing during busy time.  While I didn't sit down with my drink, I noticed the few tables around, none appearing to be particularly comfortable or private.  Also, the area where the barista will hand you your finished drink is kind of in the middle of the store, leaving you to stand awkwardly in someone's way.\n\nRegardless, it's Starbucks, and I won't hesitate to go to this location if I'm in the area.",

  "text": "When I tell people in Philadelphia that I'm Greek-American, invariably one of the first questions I'll get is \"What's your favorite Greek restaurant in Philly?\" which is quickly followed by \"What do you think of South Street Souvlaki?\" I have always been at a loss to answer either because I don't eat out often, and when I do it's almost never at a Greek restaurant. Also, as a vegetarian, I just wouldn't go to a restaurant whose name celebrates meat. \n\nSo when my friend Brad mentioned that he'd heard about a new Greek restaurant and would I check it out with him, I was immediately interested. From the initial reviews it sounded legit, more like the food I'd grown up eating at home rather than Greek food catering to American tastes (the many complaints about the lack of lettuce in the Greek salad were a good sign). The menu does still lean more towards the preferences of meat-eaters (gotta give the market what it wants) but there are several vegetarian options. No fish entrees, which seemed like a pretty major omission for a Greek restaurant, but the garidomakaronada sounds like the shrimp Santorini I used to love, which isn't something you find often. \n\nBut anyway, for my first visit the seafood test was the xtopodi (grilled octopus). Because if a Greek restaurant can't do THAT well, it'll never be great. The verdict? It has potential, but I have to admit it's not the way I'm used to having Greek-style octopus. Usually it's cut into pieces (thus more thoroughly cooked), and here the tentacles were served pretty much intact. The flavors were right though, and maybe this is the way it's actually served in Greece? It's tasty so still worth getting, but it's a huge portion so you probably want to have at least 4 people in your party who love octopus if you're going to order this.\n\nI chose the spanakopita as an entree, and that was definitely excellent. The pita was clearly house-made (not ready-made phyllo-dough) and delicious, and the spinach filling was really well done. This definitely stacked up against plenty of the better homemade spanakopita I've had. Brad got the meat-eater's version, the kreatopita (which had chicken, pork and lamb). I've never seen that in a Greek home or restaurant before, so I'm guessing this was made, again, for American tastes. But it must work, because he liked it. Both dishes came with the horiatiki salad - yes, this is what Greek salad is supposed to be like!\n\nMoving beyond the menu, the decor reminded me a lot of the more minimalist Greek tavernas I've been to, though still with a good dose of Greek art and elements (wall tiles, prints, statuettes, etc.) I could heard traditional Greek music over the loudspeaker but the noise level mostly obscured it - the restaurant was PACKED. Lots of big parties, families, etc. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and the hosts and servers ran around frantically to make sure that was the case.\n\nSo I'm happy to now know a great Greek restaurant in Philly! Well, close enough - a Philly suburb. Since most of the Greeks I know seem to prefer the suburbs anyway, this actually makes sense. In the meantime, I still need to find a good Greek restaurant in the city itself (eventually).",

The house-made pretzel had a thick, chewy exterior which was the perfect foil for the richness of the Obatzda.  The deliciousness was further enhanced by Mr. M's micro-brew and my light and bubbly hard cider.   I would have been content to stop right there.  \n\nMr. M ordered the wurst platter, which he declared excellent (not a surprise given the distinguished pedigree of the wurst).  What really sold him on the meal, however, were the handcut fries and spaetzle, which recalled Mom's recipe.   The mussels were uber-delicious (and comparable to Monk's), and only the rules of decorum prevented me from slurping the remaining broth. \n\nWe loved the intimacy that the low-lighting created in what is not an intimate space.  The service was attentive, efficient and patient with newbies.",

  "text": "I am a regular at Zizzo's, because it has the best brewed coffee in town. I probably go at least 1-2 a week just for a 24oz large coffee for 2.50!! A delicious cup of coffee (or technically three) at this price is unbeatable.\n\nI'm definitely a coffee snob and I care deeply about the roasting. My husband is from Seattle and my mother travels quite often to Colombia. Zizzo's is my favorite because they always have a light roast, medium roast, and dark roast coffee of the day to chose from. \n\nLet's talk about light roast. I have a deep appreciation for light roast coffee for a couple of reasons. First, it has the highest caffeine content. Second, it's hard to do light roast that has a good prominent flavor. All of Zizzo's light roast coffees are amazing. I personally love the Mexican Altura and the Guatemala Antigua roasts.\n\nThe medium roast is the Santa Barbara blend and it's great too. A solid go-to. I'll occasionally get a dark roast, and have never been disappointed. Occasionally they have a Tanzania peaberry, and I can never pass that up.\n\nTheir food is okay(but delicious at their other location), the clientele are friendly, they love dogs, and I've never ever had bad service. Tammy is my favorite barista, she seems genuinely happy! \n\nThis was all about the brewed coffee, but their espresso drinks are also really good. I like the Mexican mocha the best. I don't recommend the biscotti, but the other baked goods are fine.\n\nThey also give my pup a dog treat, and that makes me happy!  I also forgot to mention they have a few great beers on tap, and a fun system where locals buy each other beers in advance and Zizzo's puts their names on the wall and what someone has purchased for them.",

One table with about 10 people, and the other with about 18. Experience (as a patron and working at restaurants) tells me that, other than the obvious noise, food quality drops drastically when that happens as cooks struggle to get all the food out for that table at the same time, and other orders are either rushed through, or die in the window as they are ignored being the mountain of plates for the party. This is a good test of a kitchen, but let's keep an open mind. \n\nOur waitress Tiffany was very nice, friendly and helpful. She said she would put our order in before party which she did. Very nice. \nWe ordered the Texas cheese fries, and the grown up grilled cheese. I usually have the Monte Cristo but wanted to try something new. Had a Caesar salad for my side. \n\nWe ordered before the big party so our food got out fast. \nThe Texas cheese fries were great as expected. No complaints there. \nThe grilled cheese had roast beef in it, which tasted very bland and over cooked. The worst part was the cheese. It was sliced cheese which was by far not high end to say the least. \n\nCaesar salad was fine. Not bad, not great. \nThe croissant on salad was awesome and sadly the best part of the meal. \n\nNot sure we will return.

At Toast, in New Orleans, you may suffer from \"too much toast\" syndrome, but by suffer, I mean benefit greatly from... until you enter into a debilitating food coma 30 minutes after finishing your meal. I love toast (the bread). I love to toast (the bebidas alcoholicas). And I definitely love to Toast (eating brunch at Toast, the restaurant). All three of which, I can do at once, at Toast! On my recent visit there, I ordered the Croque Madame, and instead of the side salad, I substituted a side of bacon because... bacon! It was so good, and so filling, I couldn't finish my meal! I haven't tried the Aebelskivers yet, but can't wait to do so, along with pretty much everything else on their menu, to be honest... I also want to toast to Toast with toast, at Toast... some day soon!",

  "text": "Who doesn't love a good doughnut? I know I do... Especially when they are fresh. I mean, made in front of you fresh. I'm a huge fan of Krispy Kreme and how their donuts come out hot and fresh right off the production line. So on my recent trip to Philly, when I heard about Federal Donuts, I had to give them a try.\n\nVery interesting flavors are available to you. You can get a Cinnamon brown sugar, Strawberry lavender, or Cookies and cream.\n\nOf the 3, I think my favorite was the cinnamon brown sugar. I guess I just love the churro type of combination.\n\nI give Federal Donuts a solid 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed the donuts and like the coffee shop kinda vibe. Interestingly, they are also known for their fried chicken sandwiches. It's a great place to try a number of different things.",

  "text": "If it was located anywhere else, this venue would probably earn a three from me but the location and prices cannot be beat. \n\nWe ventured here a few minutes after it opened this morning around 11:15. The outdoor patio right next to the rail were already slowly getting filled up with patrons. We were lucky to secure the last table right next to the rail. Our host was very nice and told us our server would be with us shortly.\n\nSure enough, our server popped in to get our drink orders. \n\nThe three of us shared a combination of things from the menu.\n\nWe ordered the Fried Clam with Tartar Sauce, She Crab Soup Bowl, Grouper Tamales, Super Cajun Grouper Sandwich with Fries (+$0.99 for fries to substitute chips), Tuna Poke Tacos.\n\nMy least favorite was probably the fried clams because of the inconsistency of batter to clam ratio. Some pieces were just pieces of batter. That being said, the clam pieces were delicious. \n\nThe grouper tamales were average. The grouper was delicious and so were the sauces they served with it: rojo and salsa verde. I didn't like the masa mixture. I thought it too thick and bland. \n\nThe she crab soup was delicious but super rich. I don't think I could have eaten the entire thing by myself so thankfully it was shared among the three of us. \n\nThe grouper sandwich was delicious and very flavorful. I wasn't a fan of the fries that came with the sandwich. They were cut way too fat and not crispy enough for my liking.\n\nMy tuna poke tacos were very flavorful. I really enjoyed the sweet thai chili sauce and cabbage slaw that was underneath the tacos. The fish was generously portioned. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered their Beer of the Month special which was $2.50 for a bottle of Banks Beer. He said the beer was watered down and not flavorful but considering the price, I wasn't surprised. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I can see why people love coming here. I loved sitting right next to the rail enjoying the oceanfront views.\n\nService was great. Our server got my tuna taco order wrong but was quick to fix the issue and apologize even though we ordered a lot so it's easily misunderstand as another dish on their menu.",

I have been about 3 times since moving into the city and each time I have gone I have had a great experience. Even though I went on a holiday weekend it wasn't too busy. This place is huge, so you better be prepared to do a lot of walking. I do not recommend wearing heels as I have done in the past. My feet were not happy with me at the end of the day. I think if you can get there when the zoo first opens you'll have better luck with parking. I hate to pay for parking so I usually end up driving around a few minutes in Forest Park to find something close by. The animals are out now for the summer so you should go check them out!

With dishes like this it should be cut as close to serving as possible not to sit in a big container so it gets funny tastes. The tomatos were too soft and could of been fresh as well cucumbers were not crunchy fresh. If this would of been cut fresh I know we would of loved it but it was not. \n\nThe main meal was delicious. We ordered Persian room special came with filet mignon, chicken filet, koobideh kabob with rice and grilled vegetables. Superb!! Flavors were jumping out of all the different meat choices and cooked perfectly. Rice was great and the grilled charred tomatos were so yum!\n\nOverall this place is great!

  "text": "The Shanty is where I bought my first legal drink when I turned 21, and its where I've bought a number since. This bar is the closest thing to Cheers in Tucson, and its just an all-around great place to have a beer (HUGE selection for bottles) or hang out with some friends.\n\nThe bar has a great feel with the everything from the bar to the tables to the frames on their pictures being plated in copper. It feels kinda old-timey but in a good way. The people are friendly, a bit more mature than what youd find at Maloney's or the like, and there is a large outdoor patio area thats lush with greenery which kinda makes you feel like you're in your own private world outside of Tucson for a little while.\n\nWhy 4 stars not 5? The food--or lack thereof. They have no food service, but they do offer popcorn. I would not eat it though, if I were you. They have a popcorn machine at the front of the place and I would guess its fired up like once a week. The popcorn is unsalted, dry, and usually several days old and beyond stale. Really, you'd have to be tanked to eat the stuff. I wish they did a bit more with the whole popcorn thing or just went all out and offered some light fare to go along with your beer.\n\nOverall though, I love this place, and feel I dont go as often as I should. Next time you and your buddies are looking for a place to grab a few drinks, take the Shanty into heavy consideration.",

To start, the saki was perfect and we sat with friends taking saki shots.  The miso soup was delicious! However, they had regular spoons instead of the normal japanese soup spoons, which disappointed me.  The house salad dressing was a bit different.  Not your normal ginger dressing but an odd onion dressing that left little to be desired.  Next came a huge sushi platter that we all ordered.  It came out on a big plate in the shape of a fish (cute).  The fish tasted fresh and the sushi tasted really good (kudos to the chef).  All in all I must say that this place was enjoyable and acceptable.  I've been to better sushi places in other cities but im not sure if you can expect much more in Nashville.",

  "text": "I love historical buildings, and the old world charm associated with them, so when my friend said he actually found an affordable bed & breakfast that is more like a hotel (and supposedly haunted!), I was really stoked. We'd have the best of both worlds: a concierge available for questions and issues like you would have in a hotel, and the coziness of a B&B, both working side by side. They call these types of places boutique hotels for their small size, and their independent character.  We had no idea that they would operate in such an odd manner, though -- nothing like a traditional hotel.  For starters, there is a check-in time, and if you are unable to meet it, they send you this rather terse email with instructions as to where to find your room key, and you're not really told much about the parking.  \n\nWe had no choice but to arrive late, considering St. Petersburg is 5 hours away and we were coming on a Friday night, which means, we had to wait until the workday was over to head on the road.  Sure, I feel bad about checking in late, but I had never had it become an issue anywhere, because I normally stay in hotels or motels, and there is someone on-site 24-7.  It was also something out of my control, living all the way in Miami Beach.  My friend and I parked in the lot next door, and we suddenly realized you had to pay to park.  By the way, parking in that lot is not guaranteed, if it's full, find somewhere else to park along the street and lug your bags.  We had never experienced this, ever.  There wasn't even valet parking.  We could not pay for parking any later than 6 a.m. because that was the limit on the machine, and the lot had a tow-away sign, leaving my friend with no option but to set his alarm to 5:30 a.m. and go out to speak to staff and resolve the parking situation...except there was no staff yet at that time, so he was stuck paying by the hour once again.  Eventually, we did sort the parking issue when staff arrived later in the morning, but $10 a day for parking seems steep.  We were also told the minute we checked out, the car had to be removed.  We could not stay parked in the lot for a single minute or we'd get towed.  \n\nThe hotel itself is very cute and charming.  There is jazz music playing outside on the porch, so you can sit on the rocking chairs and relax.  The dining room is pretty, and classy, though small, but it is a small hotel after all, so it is meant to be cozy.  Breakfast is included and it is decent: muffins, cereals, tea, milk, orange juice, and other goodies. Don't expect omelettes, bacon, sausage, or a full carving meat station though.  The place is clean, and well-decorated.  We excitedly pushed into our room to check it out, and it was extremely cozy and homey, unlike the typical hotel.  You felt like you were staying in someone's guestroom.  The transom windows and doorknobs were from a time past, and they successfully integrated modern touches like the chandelier decal behind the bed and the flat screen TV.  \n\nThe bathroom was my favorite part.  I find it interesting how many people complain about the bathroom being \"small\", but I did not find it small at all.  Maybe that is because I am not a fan of large bathrooms in the first place, as that means a smaller bedroom, and I don't know about you, but I spend more time in the bedroom than the bathroom, so what is the point of a large bathroom and tiny bedroom? I had no issue with the bathroom, and in fact, was grinning ear to ear when I saw the clawfoot tub because I knew I would enjoy it later.  In fact, the next day I ran out to CVS and bought bubble bath and took a luxurious bath, to the sounds of Ella Fitzgerald on Pandora.  Very classy! All that was missing was the champagne! By the way, if you do want to use the tub, you will need to ask the concierge for a plug for it, but the plug doesn't quite seem to fit the tub.  Also, our cold, moist towels were never replaced and we had to reuse them, so there is definitely room for improvement.\n\nThe bed was comfortable, as were the pillows and sheets, but there was this loud \"drip drip\" sound.  I found the noise was coming from the window unit a/c (the cheap way to provide air conditioning, rather than central air).  I tried to make it colder, change the temperature, the speed, nothing.  I put in earplugs, and I could still hear it, to give you an idea of the loudness.  To say this was irritating is an understatement.  The next morning when I mentioned it to the concierge, he said it was the water dripping from the unit above our room.  When I asked what the solution was, he said none, unless I make him stand outside our window all night long holding a cup.  I understand they underwent an extensive renovation, but they forgot the most important detail a hotel should have: no noise while sleeping.  That is, after all the purpose of a hotel, is it not? It would behoove them to also get central air conditioning in there, to prevent the pesky dripping sounds.",

I heard so many good things about Han Dynasty, so I decided to come the instant I started craving me some good Chinese food. \n\nI ordered the following:\n-Dan Dan Noodles: This is the most popular item, and I understand why. They give you a ton of noodles and they are perfectly seasoned. It's a lot of noodles, so i recommend getting a vegetable dish to supplement and provided added texture.\n\n- Dumplings in chili oil: The dumplings were excellent. The chili oil had so much flavor! \n\n-Dry pepper chicken: I was dubious about this dish when my husband ordered it, but it was very delicious! There was a ton of flavor packed into this dish. The peppers had a nice kick to it but it wasn't overly spicy. \n\nThe prices for each dish is very reasonable! I feel like I can order a good amount of food without worrying about my wallet! What i love about Han Dynasty is that it's chock full of flavor! It's definitely worth a try in my book!",

  "text": "Standing outside for awhile, waiting for the girl who would be my gf, saw a LOT of people going into this place. Some walking out looked happy. \nCouple of pic a nic tables outside on a beautiful November day with some nice looking food being eaten. Couldn't wait. \nWe went inside and got in a line about 12 ahead of us. It went fast. Some people just came in for the huge, fresh made, decadent donuts and pastries and coffee. \nIt was noon, so we had brunch. Yes, donuts and sandwiches.  \nThere are stools facing the kitchen, booths along the wall, and it seems like it's a bigger place than it is. \nPlaced our order with a very cute freckle faced girl who was patient with our goofy acting selves.\nTHE FOOD: First up for me...Irish Coffee donut with hot cocoa. Nice soft bite on the donut, tasty, light but sweet frosting. \nCocoa was just ok.\nWaffle fries, a little less done than I like (I like my fried potato foods done a little darker), but hot and good. \nThe cheeseburger I had with bacon and a fried egg. It's quite delicious and, although it's little more than slider sized, satisfies the appetite I had. It had great flavor. It says B&B pickle on the menu, I thought it was cucumber slice on the burger, but in any case, added a little fresh crunch and lightness. Of course, the girl who would be my gf took some of my bacon...so there's THAT!\nThe girl who steals my bacon started with a muffuletta on a toasted, tasty bagel. The meats and cheese were exceptional. Not a lot, but packed with flavor. The olive mix was delicious, and overall, again, small portion, just enough,....but dynamite! She also had a had a kind of Double/Triple chocolate roll. Dark, rich, sweet, chocolate with bits of chocolate on top with some lighter chocolate mousse-like stuff squirted inside. I took 2-3 bites and had a sugar rush like a kid after Halloween. The girl who would be my gf was having a blast fingering the chocolate hole inside, so.... ?? \nShe loved it. \nThey had a nice late 80's, early 90's mix of music playing which made the girl who fingers the roll hole sing out loud. Maybe it was the sugar. \nLove this place. Not too expensive, 2 sandwiches, 2 donuts, fries, cocoa.. $27 bucks. \nGood atmosphere.",

  "text": "My husband and I have a membership, which makes it cost-effective to pop in for short bursts of time when the weather is bad (too cold, rainy or too hot) or we're in between events or we just want to see a special exhibit. \n\nWe've now been several times over the past year and we've yet to explore everything outside or see all the art inside. \n\nWe love the gardens and the beer garden, in particular. The beer garden is a great place to get a snack and feel like you are on a mini-getaway because of how it's placed on the property. My only complaint is it's a little pricey: $17 for a pretzel with spicy mustard, a lemonade, and a root beer. It's an extra charge for beer cheese, which they didn't have the other day because they said it the batch didn't taste right (thank you for not selling bad product!). They also sell beer and wine in a can, which many people seem to enjoy. \n\nTake the docent tour of the Lilly House to get more insight into the property. You'll want to see it at Christmas when it is decorated and in the summer when it is in \"everyday mode.\"\n\nCheck the website for the exhibits, and if you think you will return again and again, the membership really does pay for itself while you can feel good about supporting the arts in Indy.",

  "text": "I loved the space, the concept, the communal tables, the outdoor heat lamps but the food left something to be desired. \n\nI did not like any of the three BBQ sauce options. I really actually hated one of them. And that's hard to do to a sauce lover like myself. The meats also were a 3/5 for BBQ standards. The ribs were no good and I heard the same about the brisket. The chicken, sausage and pulled pork were all fine. The pulled pork was really enhanced by the vinegar sauce.\n\nI think that I might like it more as drunk food so perhaps I'll put this on the end-of-the-night list in the future. In fact, that's the reason why I didn't give it a 2.  Maybe they should consider staying open past 12 on Fridays and Saturdays.",

I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for a great bagel; why would you go to a chain place when you could support locals, and the product is infinitely better? The only improvement could be in selection- I would love to see some whole wheat everything bagels, or multigrain styles.\n\nThey also sell doughnuts, which are good, very good, and fresh... but not great. Then again, I have been to Doughnut Plant NYC, which was basically life-changing, so again, bar set high. But it's a nice bonus when I'm picking up bagels to bring home a treat. If you're into really soft, light, yeasty doughnuts, you will like these. Husband enjoyed the red velvet cake doughnut.",

My wife, our daughter, our sister-in-law and I stopped in for lunch; and, Hellas did not disappoint.\n\nOur daughter had a Cherry Coke, our in-law had a Raspberry Tea, while my wife had a Strawberry Sangria; and, I had a glass of Greek White Wine.  We started with the Saganaki, a staple appetizer; and, we all proclaimed, \"Opa\" when our server, Simon, lit the cheese on fire.  We all dug in and enjoyed the rich, gooey cheese with freshly baked bread.\n\nWe also ordered the Dalmades Appetizer, which was fantastic.  We just cannot seem to find the hot, meat-stuffed grape leaves outside of Hellas; and, no one, I am sure, could come close to the delicious lemony, buttery sauce.  \n\nMy wife had the Gyro Platter, which was so large we made two meals out of the leftovers; and, I had the Souvlaki (grilled pork cubes served on Pita, with tzatziki sauce.)   Our daughter tried the Pastitsio; and, she loved it.  And, our Sister-in-law had the Mousaka and enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe standout dessert was the Baklava Cheesecake which my wife and our Sister-in-law split.

  "text": "Found this place on a walk in uptown, and returned later for a dinner, and (spoiler) it was superb.  I've traveled Spain and the rest of Europe, and my spawn has spent a significant time in Spain, and we both loved the Barcelona.\n\nIn fact, up to this point, the best tapas I have consumed were not actually in Spain, but Amsterdam at Joselito, where we were so enthused we ordered the entire menu.\n\nWith most small plates at Barcelona costing $5-$6, you can order a whole bunch of food to share and enjoy;  the also offer cooked to order paella, with the traditional rice base, and a variation featuring angel hair pasta.  They also have some entrees, and the whole menu is online.\n\nWe tried a variety of hot and cold tapas and loved them all.  My favorites were the ones featuring Jamon Serrano, and I liked his version of Patatas with aioli drizzle. \n\nIf you live in New Orleans, you'll find Barcelona a nice change.  You can linger and sample a variety of dishes. Great date nite place.  It's right behind the Walgreens on Carrolton.\n\nTourists can find the restaurant with a half block walk off the St. Charles streetcar, so when you get tired of deep fried seafood at high prices in the Quarter, hop on the street car and transport yourself temporarily to an evening in Spain.\n\nHe has an \"order slip\" at the table similar to the ones in sushi bars - just read the descriptions on the menu and check off your choices on the paper slip.",

  "text": "Have you seen the movie Tampopo?\n\nIt's an old Japanese movie from 1986 and the main theme is about making good Ramen. Everything starts with the broth, and you can tell a broth is good is by watching whether if a customer finishes the whole bowl or not. In Japanese society, it's also very polite to slurp your noodles as this is another sign that the Ramen is good. \n\nHowever, in the west, it's very impolite to slurp your noodles as I caught myself doing after receiving my bowl of Ramen. \n\nBefore getting to the good stuff, let's rewind a little bit. \n\nFound this gem of a place thru Yelp (surprise) as Wifey was searching for a place to eat. Since we were in downtown Reno and we already drove past Sparks, I quickly bookmarked the place to try the next day. That was this Sunday, and we went here on Monday during Memorial Day. Glad they were open since their secondary location was closed. I called them first just to make sure they were open.\n\nLocated a couple of miles North of John Ascuaga's Nugget, it was easy to find. It's tucked in a corner of an unassuming strip mall that hasn't been updated since the 70's. It's not much to look at from the outside, but you never judge a book by it's cover...you already know that. \n\nOnce you set foot inside, everything just lightens up as you get whisked away in some part of Japan. The walls are decorated with bamboo panels and the tables and chairs are in perfect harmony with one another. From the decors to the paintings on the wall and even the fine chopsticks that are arranged in a bamboo holder on every table. They even have a section of traditional Japanese tables on a tatami mat where you have to remove your shoes to eat at. The place had a Zen-like vibe to it, and I was digging the tranquility.\n\nOur server, Jackie, was superb as she was warm, friendly, efficient and fast. We had a party of four (Me, Wifey, Son and Mother-in-Law) as we got seated and checked out the menu. I noticed a note on the menu describing the place was established by Chef Yoshi from Japan, who has also worked in China and France perfecting his craft as he wanted to bring the first authentic Ramen experience to Reno. \n\nBoy has he succeeded. \n\nWe ordered three bowls of Tonkatsu ($7.75) with extra Chasu/Pork ($2.50) and one bowl of vegetarian ($7.75). I also ordered a bowl of Chasu Salad for starters. The broth is described as white, light and creamy extracted from bone marrows that are slowly simmered. (Did your mouth just water?)\n\nSalad was a mixed green with chopped pork, corn, bamboo shoots, soy beans balanced together by a sesame sauce. It was light, tasty and a nice starter course. \n\nThen came the Ramen. The extra Chasu comes in separate bowl and I quickly realized that all sides comes in their own separate bowls, which made for a nice visual reference. You can also control the portions of how much you want to add. \n\nFast forward to me slurping like a slobbering pig.\n\nThe broth was light yet tasty. For me, it was an excellent broth since it wasn't too salty unlike some other Ramen places where they sodium content is thru the roof. It was a perfect balance of richness, creaminess and deliciousness, and you can always add some soy sauce or chili powder to your liking. I choose not to add any condiments as I was enjoying the flavor as it was meant to be. The pork was also superb as it was tender and meaty with all the porky goodness that a Bacon-lover would approve of. \n\nThe only negative thing on the Ramen would have to be the noodles itself - some were clumpy and chunky. Ramen noodles are supposed to separate easily and not get stuck together. However, it was a minor detail that I was willing to overlook as I was thoroughly immersed from the broth with my head down slurping like a Nihonjin. \n\nLike the movie Tampopo, I finished the broth as well as my wife's bowl.",

The wait was only about 30 minutes which is pretty good for breakfast/brunch on a Saturday in Nashville. My friend and I both ordered the Not Bloody Mary which is their own house made Bloody Mary with cucumber and basil and their own tomatoes. Super refreshing but doesn't pair well if you get something sweet like the cinnamon roll or homemade biscuit with honey like we did. Those two items were SO good. The cinnamon roll wasn't too sweet or sticky, it was perfect. The biscuit was cooked perfectly and fell apart like it should have. Not dry at all and the honey to top it was incredible. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of our main meals. My friend got the TN Ham and apple sandwich, which didn't have much flavor and I think it's because he said he wanted it without the honey mustard and got mayo. Bad choice. I think it would've been better with the honey mustard. I got the Dirty Benny, which is essentially eggs Benedict but they use prosciutto and some kind of gravy. Way too salty for me with both the prosciutto and gravy together. The English muffin was also soggy and not crisp at all. But the home fries were soooo good. I love them. Super crisp and flavorful. \n\nI'd like to come back to this place and try something else, though. Definitely worth it!",

I like sitting at the counter because you get to witness the bustling and super efficient kitchen. I also like watching my meal being made. For those with purses and bags, there are hooks at the counter so you can hang them! \n\nAs for the food! The orange juice is freshly squeezed so it was a must for me. It can be quite refreshing, especially after a night of drinking in Reno. I opted for the huevos rancheros and my boyfriend the Hawaiian Breakfast plate. \n\nWe both thought that the Hawaiian Breakfast plate was okay. It came with Portuguese sausages (which I usually love but I found these to be a bit bland and salty), fried spam, eggs, and white rice. There was a lot of white rice. \n\nHowever, I enjoyed everything about my huevos rancheros. It came in a huge skillet with fried tortillas, eggs, hash browns, pinto beans, cole slaw, and a side of warmed tortillas. The ranchero sauce dousing my dish was flavorful and addicting! Best huevos rancheros I've ever had! The big portion meant I had leftovers to take home but to be honest, they didn't last very long. I immediately microwaved it and ate it a few hours later.\n\nI would definitely recommend stopping by for brunch here!",

  "text": "After my experience here, I have to seriously ask: What are these reviewers smoking?! And...how did this place receive a \"People Love Us on Yelp\" sticker?! (That must have been stolen from another business)\n\nMy friends and I are desserts and boba ADDICTS (seriously), and there's rarely any leftovers when we start indulging in both. But, this place managed to make us stop after one bite, which is unheard of!\n\nUpon walking into this small, lackluster bakery, we had to wait a couple of minutes before someone came from the back to help us (no greeting whatsoever). Given that this was an Asian bakery, and most Asian places are infamous for their (lack of) customer service, we let that go.\n\nHere's where things get a bit awkward. In their display cases, they have a TON of bread, pastries, and other desserts just sitting there for you to indulge in...with your eyes. We tried ordering what we saw, but the cashier kept telling us that it wasn't available. How is it not available when the display case is filled with them? Couldn't he at least take one out of the display case? You don't need to display 10 of the same thing for others to see what it is.\n\nIt would have been so much easier if he just told us what was available in the back. Needless to say, their \"available\" selections were quite LIMITED. There were maybe only 4-5 things we could choose from.\n\nEgg Tart: This place has one of the WORST egg tarts I've ever eaten. One bite out of this FLAVORLESS, STALE pastry, I could barely even force myself to finish the first bite. Egg tarts are supposed to be flaky on the outside and bursting with flavors in the middle. I experienced none of that magical combo. Only thorough disappointment. ): \n\nChocolate Mousse-Like Dessert: I don't know what they think chocolate tastes likes, but this certainly isn't how it's supposed to taste like. A spoonful of this gelatin-like dessert is enough to make you vomit in your own mouth. Definitely steer clear if you don't want a vomit party happening in your mouth.\n\nCoconut Custard: This was probably the best out of the three we tried. Though it's far from spectacular, it didn't make us want to spit it out right away. The custard didn't have much flavor, and the bun itself was pretty bland, but at least it didn't have a funny taste to it.\n\nAnd here comes the icing to the cake...\nBoba: We originally came here for boba. Although we weren't expecting the quality we'd find from The Bay Area, we weren't expecting it to be this bad. You could definitely tell that the milk tea was made from a powder packet (one that you can easily buy from an Asian grocery store). The boba was appallingly terrible! It was really hard and tasted like plastic. I LOVE boba, but even I couldn't finish something as terrible as this.\n\nThey should rename Honey Bakery to...HORRIBLE BAKERY! I don't remember ever being this disappointed by boba and desserts. After snowboarding all day, we just wanted to enjoy some good desserts and sip on some boba, is that too much to ask for?! ):",

  "text": "Xiang Gourmet is an authentic Hunan restaurant with excellent food that is slightly on the pricier side. They're located right in Center City so the prices are in line with the location.  Portion sizes were large and you could tell the food was higher quality.  I went with a large group so I was able to try a variety of dishes. \n\nI wouldn't normally order tilapia because it's a bland fish that takes on whatever flavors it's cooked with. However, XG's Whole Tilapia was cooked perfectly and came in a beautiful and bright chili sauce that looked spicier than it actually was. The homemade sticky rice shao mei is an absolute must! So fresh and tasty. I've never had preserved egg before so I jumped at the opportunity to try it. It had a unique mild flavor unlike anything I've had. I really loved it and would order again. Another favorite of mine was the deep fried buns you dip in sweetened condensed milk. They reminded me of beignets; very light and fluffy dough.\n\nMy favorite dish was something I normally love to order: diced chicken with chili pepper and peanuts. The peanut flavor really came through in the dish because the peanuts were fried with the chicken.  I also LOVED the spiciness as a lot of other restaurants don't make the chicken itself spicy enough.\n\nThe restaurant is beautifully decorated with some really nice design elements. Service was attentive but a few things had to be asked for twice. Highly recommend if you're nearby and don't feel like making the trek to Chinatown!",

  "text": "My South Jersey relatives love to go to this local place for the $12.95 \"Sunset Special\" (\"such a deal!\") and for some reason I faintly recalled not liking their food from a long ago lunch and had no desire to ever go again.   After taking mom for cataract surgery recently she was craving the mussels over pasta so I couldn't say no and off we went - frankly, I was not expecting much.\n\nI wasn't terribly hungry and figured I'd be reasonably safe with the Chicken Caesar salad (I know - yawn) and mom ordered her mussels.  All the specials come with soup and salad and I was expecting her soup to be a cup of flavored corn starch a la a typical cheap diner.  I had to eat my thoughts (literally and figuratively) when the vegetable soup came  -tomato based and chock full of fresh veggies- it was tasty so I ordered a cup myself! Add to this some of the best rolls I have ever had - crispy outside, dense and hot and flaky/chewy inside - soooo good with olive oil!\n\nOur food arrived, each sloppy, ginormous plate looking like it could feed a family of four.    My salad had yummy grilled chicken, delicious creamy dressing with undertones of anchovy, tomatoes, cukes, canned black olives (yuck), marinated peppers and a hardboiled egg that had been cut with a steak knife.  I tried a mussel and they were good, the sauce was decent but not very memorable.  There was some wilted, I guess meant to be decorative, purple stuff on the plates that was just sort of scary.\n\nThe chef needs to work on details and presentation but the flavors were good, the food was cooked well and I could eat a million of those hot, crispy rolls.  I'd give a 3.5 if I could here, components of the meal were wonderful, others not so much but I would definitely go again.",

I went with a couple friends and we visited during their happy hour. My friend and I shared the dragon shrimp, mango crab rangoon, blue balls and crispy rice cakes. I loved the mango crab rangoon and the blue balls, they were my favorite. The Blue Balls are tempura fried tofu pockets stuffed with spicy crab mix, served with eel sauce and they are delicious.

  "text": "How does this place only have 4 reviews? They ROCK!!!!!! If you love country, u will love it. If you don't love country, don't worry they play some hip hop songs too. If you like to line dance, you will LOVE this place. The line dancing classes are very helpful and cheap. The instructor is very thorough and lets you practice many times. Friday nights are great cuz they aren't TOO packed so you can get a spot on the dance floor and they have $1 bud lites. Saturdays get so crazy packed that I can't stand it. So if you like space to move around, stick to Friday. Also at 11pm on weekends, there is a food truck guy outside who grills the BEST chicken sandwiches and hot dogs, etc. The only thing I don't like is i always smell like smoke when I leave. But it's such a good time I don't mind it. And they tend to play the same songs over and over but I just avoid the radio during the week and then i look forward to their music.",

  "text": "I'm between a 3 and a 4 stars for this review, but since Yelp doesn't do half stars I'm giving them a 4 because of the veggie and vegan friendly options.\n\nI work across the street from Sizzle Pie, and end up eating here at least once a week. I really like that they have nine pies ready to go every day that you can just grab a slice from. They heat it up in the oven, and usually takes 5-10 minutes to get your food and be on your way. 3 of the pies are always meat, 3 are veggie, and 3 are always vegan. The vegan mozzarella is surprisingly good, I actually prefer it to the normal dairy cheese. They also have a lot of fun veggie protein options like pepperoni, sausage, and soy curls. Their pie combinations are always changing and are very unique. Definitely the most variety I have seen in a pizza place. \n\nOnly things I don't 100% love is that sometimes the pies are a little greasy and I have to use a few paper towels to mop them off. Also sometimes the crust is a little over baked and it really tough to eat. It's a little hit and miss, sometimes it's totally fine, sometimes it's not.\n\nOverall I'm a big fan because of the variety and options that suit all diets. They also have a bar, nice patio area with firepits and are open late. Worth a visit!",

  "text": "When you talk about hidden gems, Goleta Red Distilling Company immediately comes to mind. It's hidden inside a Goleta industrial business park off Castilian and Cortona Drives. Often the owner Michael will put out a sign at this intersection mentioning tastings that are happening. You'll find a door next to a window with an awning, enter there, then follow the guided signs to their tiny tasting room connected to a massive distillery. \n\nI originally found out about Goleta Red at a past Official Yelp Event thrown by my predecessor Stephanie W (https://www.yelp.com/biz/oye-sips-samples-and-sweaters-goleta-red-distilling-company-goleta?hrid=a6i2sWY0wVSZElPv8pX4og&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)). Since then, Michael has been active at local festivals, on social media (Instagram and Facebook) and even offers a deal on Axxess card for 2 x 1 spirits! The minute you enter the door, rosy-cheeked Michael befriends you with his wonderful energy and one man show. While this happens to be his business, it is more of his hobby and passion. He provides tastings of all his liquors: Sterling Silver Rum, Solid Gold Rum, Cacao-flavored Rum, Orange Java Overproof Rum, Fiesta Agave Spirit \"Tequila,\" and Goodland Gin. I'm normally not a fan of gin, but the Goodland Gin possesses a beautiful botanical/herbal flavor profile that stands out in any drink. You can even find it at some bars around town! Once you have tasted a pour of each, then Michael offers one of his creative boozy concoctions made with his own spirits.\n\nThis past Halloween, my partner and I came in here while he was open for pre-Trick-Or-Treating. We wanted to make that custom a bit more tolerable with the hoards of kids. Michael mixed up a Ghostly Pumpkin and Corpse Reviver 2. Both were super unique and went down easily by being well-balanced. Michael is fun to chat with and is extremely knowledgeable about distilling given that he loves to educate himself and explore novel techniques--whether or not he succeeds or fails. If you haven't already checked this place out, be sure to!",

  "text": "All things considered, I enjoyed the food at Capri as well as the customer service. I stayed at the adjacent Budget motel that for two nights while on business in Boise (that's another story) and tried Capri for breakfast during BSU's graduation weekend this year. This location is quite festive in the morning, given its proximity to the motel and other businesses on Fairview Avenue. \n\nStarting with the food, I would rate it 8/10. It was pretty good (slightly greasy), yet palatable. I was so hungry that I really didn't want to waste time eating fast food anywhere on Fairview Ave, so I chose the meat lover's omelette along with a side of hashbrowns and a cup of coffee. I think that I paid a total of $11 before the tip. Very filling, which served its purpose in not keeping me hungry for several hours.\n\nThe seating is not bad at all. There is a bar area (where I sat at), as well as side tables on the far left of the dinner wall as well as within the front and toward the right of the venue. The bar area had some very \"interesting\" conversation from travelers and locals alike, which actually lightened up the mood. The servers were attentive and very sweet, and made sensible recommendations on the food items listed within the menu. \n\nIf the decision came to choose fast food versus this location, I'll take the latter for $500, Alex.",

As soon as I saw the spicy tuna, it was love at first sight. \n\nI got a brown rice bowl with spicy shoyu tuna and topped it with scallions, pickled ginger, house made eel sauce, sesame seeds and avocado. Holy moly. So delicious. The avocado was nice because it took a little of the heat off, not that I minded how spicy it was. (If you're not a spice lover, get the plain Shoyu Tuna.)\n\nMy boyfriend got the burrito with jasmine rice, nori, half shoyu/spicy tuna, kale, avocado and some other goodies. Also delicious. \n\nFresh fish - this is huge for me. The fish had zero odor and was a beautiful colour. My only constructive suggestions would be to possibly chop the tuna a little smaller. In Hawaii it's traditionally small cubes - these were bigger chunks. Just a personal preference I guess. And I would love if there were a cold sushi rice option, kind of like a chirashi bowl. Feels a little odd putting my fresh chilled tuna on a base of warm brown rice.\n\nDelicious. Will return. Maybe tomorrow. Highly recommend!",

  "text": "Friday night, we were finally able to give Hedge Row a full test. We had been there only for a mid-day snack and that was not enough fully to review. It must be pointed out that Chef Brad Gates is the real deal. He was Union Square's chef de cuisine for 10 years. Also, this restaurant is focused on wood roasting and locally sourcing (to the extent possible). So, for example, some of the veggies came from Silverthorn Farms (one of our favorites). Friday night, we were with four other people and everyone at the table was willing to share. Accordingly, we got lots of different tastes. It was the unanimous judgment of each of us that everything we tasted was excellent! We started with the shrimp hush puppies, wood roasted carrots and wood roasted beets. We had enjoyed the shrimp hush puppies before (on our mid-day snack) and, as before, they were truly delicious. The wood roasting gave the carrots and the beets a lovely flavor. On Chef's recommendation, we moved to the lamb meatballs and each of us enjoyed one. The lamb came from Viking Farms. The flavors in them were extraordinary and were we not saving room for other tastes, we could each have handled more. Next we went to the mains and four were ordered that were shared six ways: the half chicken (Gunthorp Farms), trout (Rushing Waters), salmon (Skuna Bay, Canada) and the pasta with veal bolognese. Jacque Pepin, in a cooking class, had told my spouse that roast chicken is the test for a good chef. It seems so simple, but to do it right is really difficult. Hedge Row DID IT RIGHT! The difficult trick is keeping the breast moist while cooking the thigh fully. Our half chicken was just outstanding. The breast was still moist and not dried out and the dark meat was perfectly cooked. For us, the test on trout is whether the skin is crispy and the trout not overdone. The sauce for the trout included a hint of ginger which gave it an unusual flavor which we all enjoyed. Again, Hedge Row passed with flying colors. The trick on salmon is getting it done enough without overcooking and, once again, the salmon was just done enough. It's accompaniment was Asian in flavor and complemented it very well. It should be noted that with each of these dishes, there is no place to hide mistakes. And there were none that had to be hidden. It is possible that the pasta bolognese is a bit more forgiving, but here the question is the flavor of the veal bolognese (outstanding), the amount of sauce (excellent - not over sauced, a common error) and proper cooking of the pasta. Again, a dish that we all enjoyed. Finally, four of us went off menu for our dessert, ordering either the chocolate or vanilla ice cream and a shot of espresso we could pour over (for our own affagatos). Two of our number ordered the sticky toffee pudding (a mainstay of the lamented R Bistro). The pud was wonderful and our affagatos were just the right, light end to the meal. We paired the first part of the meal with a lovely mid-coast California rose (which was dry and fruit forward). The last half or the meal, I chose a Barbera d'Alba which was a light enough red to go with everything. So our bottom line is whether a restaurant will make our regular rotation. This one definitely is going into the rotation.",

Take this morning, for instance. I had a nice conversation with the very personable lady at the counter regarding our kids. (She showed me a pic of one her sons - pulled it out of her apron pocket - love that!) Then I waited for my decaf frappucino. The girl making the drink put one down only it was slightly wrong (caramel instead of coffee) so she took it back and tried again. Evidently, she wasn't able to get it right so she had the guy working there do it. The guy made it (and it was perfection, btw - so many places don't know to blend the ice until smooth and you end up with ice chunks blocking your straw) and I thanked him and was just about on my way when the girl who had tried making it let me know she had comped my drink since it took a little long. Wait? What? I wasn't even upset about it nor did I complain and they took it upon themselves to comp my drink? In the words of DJ Lance Rock on Yo Gabba Gabba, \"That was Awwwwesommmmme!\" Seriously, most places don't do anything to correct wrongs unless you complain. This was sincerely most appreciated and it dawned on me that I have always gotten primo service at this particular Starbucks. Bravo!",

  "text": "This place was fantastic!!  I cannot say enough good things about it.  The restaurant is a staple of Indy, and whether you are here visiting or live here...you have to check it out.  I would recommend reservations.  However, if you do not make them and they are full...the bar area is lively and fun and you can either wait  there and have a drink or eat there.  The Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail is a must.  I love spicy and boy did it clear out the sinuses.  I thought another person in our party was going to fall over it was so hot for them.  Side note...you can buy the cocktail sauce in a bottle from the restaurant.  Every one in our party got a steak.  The ribeye was wonderful and melted in your mouth.  A buddy gave the filet the same review.  Each steak came with a side and a soup.  I had the lobster bisque...so chunky with large lobster pieces I didn't know what i was eating...again it was great.  I had the mashed potatoes as a side...pretty good as well.  The meal was so filling...would go back often if I could.  As an added side note...the Dalai Lama was also dining at St. Elmo's the night we were there...very cool.  He would not steer you wrong!!  Check it out!",

  "text": "OK rest of world, we are now officially complete here in Goleta. We have a quartet of breweries, a winery and now we have the triple crown jewel of a fully functional distillery . Yes, its true, we have Goleta Red distillery right in the heart of the deepest, darkest industrial estate Goleta has to offer. Heck, you can hardly find this place even when you know where it is let alone if you are a first time visitor. But hey, persevere, and you will be rewarded with the fine libations and excellent conversations that are always present at Goleta Red :-) The owner/distiller Michael Craig is a savant as well as being an all around great guy. I learned so much about distilling and spirits as a whole just hanging with him for a couple hours, it was so well worth the visit!! If you love your spirits and have have itch for an awesome Gin and Tonic, stop by Goleta Red, you'll definitely be glad you did :-)",

It was so much fun and I as weird as it sounds it would probably be a good mommy hang out with your other mommy friends eat a pizza and drink wine while your kids run a muck place... so you can catch like 30 minutes to yourself LOL \n\nIt's totally understaffed and unloved inside but what chuck e cheese isn't? The part I like the most is that they are high on security. You and your kid are uniquely marked and have to be together when exiting. It's fun it's cheap who doesn't like that? there are always coupons and an easy place for you to let your kids blow off some steam and run around. =)",

I had my intro meeting on Monday 4/1 with Wes where he spend about 45 minutes showing me around, explaining how their classes work, etc. He broke it down and made it less intimidating to go to a new gym. I signed up for the 1 month trial membership and have already used it 2x! These work outs are HARD. Especially for a newbie, but I love the pace, it is new everyday, they have two options lean and cross fit. This is nice because it always gives options. The people are not rude, always help you out, the others that go there are welcoming as you're in and out in ONE HOUR!! They have a beautifully designed yoga room, clean bathrooms, showers, and an area for your kiddos to hang out while you work out. I hope this becomes a new lifestyle for me. So far so good!",

  "text": "This is one of two Dottie's locations in Philadelphia and it's fabulous. This small donut shop offers a wide variety of all-vegan donuts that will knock your socks off. I brought a dozen to my non-vegan quasi-in-laws and all of them loved the donuts, including the picky children.\n\nIn particular, the chocolate pistachio ($3), the Boston Creme ($3) and the coffee cake (which is one of the few non-donut offerings they have) were wonderful.\n\nThese donuts also hold up well. They still tasted good even 48 hours later, whereas I've found most other donuts are stale within a few hours.\n\nIf you've had the vegan donuts at places like Donut Friend or Donatsu in LA, or Glam Doll in Minneapolis, expect similar quality at Dottie's. \n\nAlso, Dottie's is way better than famous (but mediocre) places like Voodoo Donuts, Mighty-O and Dun-well in Portland, Seattle and NYC, respectively.",

  "text": "We've been to Texas de Brazil locations in Fort Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Miami-Doral and now Tampa, and they all have what it takes to keep people like us returning: beautiful place, great service and outstanding food. We've asked some staff at various locations about their restaurants, and each share the same response about quality food, presentation and service. They know if they do thier best together, it shows and customers will return. If not, they'll never come back.\n\nConcentrating now on the Tampa location, it's a beautiful, spacious and well-laid out restaurant, spotless, nicely appointed and easy to maneuver. I suggest you try a signature Brazilian drink, the caipirinha. They are a bit sweet, very refreshing and some will think you are speaking Portuguese after the second drink. They pack a jujitsu punch! \n\nThe salad bar is like none I've seen before. It is amazingly huge, full of 60+ delicious high-quality goodies from various types of lettuce and greens, plenty of salads, garnishes, olive selections, shrimp, exotic veggies, sushi, about 10 cheeses, various razor-thin prosciutto and salamis, breads and on and on. Lobster Bisque and wonderful side dishes are right there to load at will.  The attendants keep the salad bar meticulously clean, fully stocked and always looking like a postcard. (You have a \"salad bar only\" option, if you'd prefer to graze further and pass on the meat entree selections).\n\nNow on the the headliners: grilled meats that are served until you decide to stop eating, or simply explode. Each selection is skewered onto long swords, cooked to perfection, then transported throughout the restaurant by gauchos looking for your nod. They'll provide whatever you'd like, as much as you'd like, as often as you'd like. Every cut of beef, filet mignon, sirloin, prime rib, pork roast, chicken, lamb chops, sausages, beef ribs...it keeps coming until you surrender, and it's worth every tender bite. The grill team are clearly Masters.\n\nIf there is any room at all in your body, any of the desserts will leave you intensely satisfied and shaking your head wondering how you ate all that you did.\n\nIn spite of what you may think, this really isn't a place for gluttons or those loading their plates and juggling back to the table. This is a class operation serving top quality food and drinks with impeccable service, and well worth the price. This is a very special family of restaurants that I'll bet you'll love.",

  "text": "Is it fair to rate a place strictly on your first visit and one slice of pizza? Maybe not, but if you go to Paulie's for no other reason, go for the General Tso pizza. \n\nMy friend was raving about it so of course we had to give it a shot. At the time of our arrival, there wasn't any General Tso slices available to pop in the oven and serve. Despite the fact that our group didn't want to buy an entire pie, they happily made one up and let us buy individual slices. \n\nSo the General Tso slice is unique and combines two of my loves: pizza and Chinese food. Just an aside, I could only imagine the amazingness of this combo as cold leftovers. Back to the slice, it was large, and covered with General Tso's chicken, extra sauce, broccoli and pepper flakes. It was sweet, spicy, carby and cheesy. Now that's a synergy!\n\nI loved every unique bite of my experience. I could go back to Paulie's to sample their other menu options but they certainly have a show stopper with the General Tso.",

  "text": "My kids and I love this place! We've been coming for a couple years now. They have to long walls of choices. Your typical stuff, plates, bowls, mugs, figurines, cups, etc. Of all shapes and sizes. And costs of course range greatly, from $6-$50, with most things in the $10-$20 range. Their painting fee is $8 a person, but on Mondays it's $1, and they always have coupons and deals on their website. There's never a reason for you to pay full price for everything. The room is really big and airy and not closed in, which I greatly appreciate. Painted Zebra is so tiny I feel like I'm suffocating. Not so here. The manager Travis is the nicest guy. Really helpful with everything and very pleasant affect. \n\nThe only downside: the chocolate store right next door that my kids always sucker me into stopping by ;) \n\nMy kids and I only do this kind of thing twice a year, because it is kinda pricey, but we'd never go anywhere else when we do.",

I popped in here with my stroller (the ramp is super helpful for this!). Their coffee menu is impressive as is their machinery. I almost went with the Dirty Hippie (chai tea + espresso) but went with an Iced Latte on a lark. It was SO delicious and refreshing. I usually don't finish all of my coffee drinks, but I slurped up all of this yummy treat. The fun twisty straw was a bonus! \n\nI also ordered a turkey panini with a side of cottage cheese for some nosh and it was very good. Sliced turkey deli meat, avocado, herby mayo, tomato on crispy wheat bread made this sandwich one to remember!\n\nI loved sitting out on their patio, cooling off, enjoying my meal and catching the sights of mid-morning Broad Ripple. It made for a very pleasant morning. I am not sure WHY it took me so long to visit, but I am so glad I did; and I'll definitely be back!",

You can mix types of wine and you get 4 total, which equals about a glass and a half of wine. My favorite that I tried was the pinot grigio. We ended up getting a bottle of it and a bottle of the Reserve Cab Sav (which is not available in flights). I loved the Cab Sav too! \n\nThe owner gave us some free samples of their wine slushie and OMG were they amazing! They were the perfect treat and not too sweet. I definitely want to come back and get them again.\n\nOverall, this is a super fun and cozy winery! They do different events on the weekends, so be sure to check out their website!",

  "text": "I have been coming to Molly's for lunch when I started working at ARAMARK in April. I love that they are the same owners as Iovine Produce, which I go to every week to get my groceries. I haven't tried much on the menu, because I always go with the market summer salad. Seriously, this salad is heaven. FRESH veggies, fruit. feta cheese and a ridiculous strawberry chipotle dressing that I could probably drink its so delish. Also, the portions are huge so your almost guaranteed leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nI went in 2 weeks ago for my usual salad, and somehow was charged $5 more than should have been when I looked at my cc transcript. When I reached out to let them know, let's just say that the owners took care of the issue, and more. I was sent a wonderful apology email thanking me for my patronage. I am sure these people are doing pretty well and didn't think they would care about one customer, but it really is the exact opposite. I was made to feel like I was the most important customer that they have and I really will never forget that.\n\nThe food is excellent, the service is good, and above all, the customer service is nothing short of perfect.",

  "text": "I had an excellent dining experience here on 08-25-2011.   Maximo's always had a good reputation, but I had not eaten here in 20 years, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.\n\nWe arrived at 7:00 pm on a Thursday, and the place was pretty empty.  We had reservations but were told we could sit wherever we wanted.  We opted for the very first booth (2-top) situated on the left wall as you walk in.  We were seated immediately and greated by our server (Erin).  Our drinks arrived in a jiffy, along with some delicious hot bread.\n\nThe restaurant is narrow but you don't get the feeling like you're sitting right on top of the table next to you.  The decor is upscale and the stained wooden ceilings are a nice touch.  There are pictures everywhere but they don't take away from the dining experience.\n\nFor an appetizer, we had the Sicilian shrimp which was grilled and wrapped in prosciutto.  They give you four nice sized prawns, so it's worth the money.  My entree selection was the Osso Buco, which is a veal shank cooked on the bone.  It is the house specialty and is absolutely delicious.  You don't need a knife because the veal is so tender than you can eat it with a fork.  As is customary, they give you a tiny appetizer fork so that you can eat the marrow from inside the bone.  I know this may sound a little weird to some, but don't knock it till you try it.  Although not as tasty as the veal itself, the marrow was very rich and had a buttery texture.\n\nWe also had the fire roaseted seafood entree, which consisted of gulf shrimp, large scallops and fish (grouper).  I love scallops and shrimp, but the grouper stole the show on this plate.  The habernero infused olive oil really kicks it up a notch, but not to the point where you don't taste the seafood and appreciate it for what it is.\n\nFor dessert, we had the tiramisu beacuse it's made in house and it doesn't get any fresher than that.  Although not my favorite dessert, I prefer in house desserts to those that are store bought or shipped to the restaurant.\n\nLastly, I'd like to commend my server Erin.  She was extremly attentive (without being intrusive) and very helpful with the menu choices.  Her personality make her perfectly suited for her job and she is a definite asset to Maximo's.  It's readily apparent when a person truly enjoys their job and Erin fits the bill.  \n\nThanks for making our dining experience here a memorable one.",

  "text": "I'm going to be upfront about my dislike of the parking situation in Down Town Tampa.  So when I got to the location, finding parking was hard! I ended up across the street at the parking structure for the Glazer Children's Museum, which was charging a singular priced parking due to Phantom Of the Opera going on at the Straz. \n\nThe walk to Anise wasn't bad, the lights were in my favor, and the scenery was nice with all the Christmas lights glowing in the early evening.  What I found distasteful, was the host- a young man in his early 20's, with light brown hair- wasn't paying attention to the door, he was head down over his phone, likely texting or checking Facebook. I had to speak up to get his attention. Only then did he let me know where my party was.  \n\nMy party was that, a company Christmas party, about 25 people in attendance, drinks and appetizers provided by the venue. I have to admit, though I was a bit concerned over the offerings, I was actually quite happy with the flavours! We had curried chicken wings, curried deviled wings with lobster and vegitarian paninin.  All were delicious! I -LOVED- the deviled eggs, there was just something about them, they were TOTALLY off the chart. \n\nThe decor is amazing! I loved the bookcases in the bar area, the hydropinic greens in the lobby and the light fixtures that hung down from the high ceilings. This place has character! I can't wait to visit again, and am hoping that Anna will be my guide next time because I have a feeling I'd be out of my league!\n\nHats off to the Tender with the amazing dreads, Jarod(?) Sorry if I got the name wrong. He was really warm and friendly, totally LOVED his attitude!",

I will digress here...\n\nSix Row was closed for the day (Six Row is my favorite...shout out to 6 Row who gets worse reviews than UC but has a friendlier more knowledgeable bartender in Isaac and much better (and worse) beer offerings. Agreed that the flavors at 6Row are polarizing - they strike out or hit home runs. But hey, St. Louis loved Marc McGwire for doing that, and St. Louis should show some more love to 6Row and the best bartender the city has. \n\n...and return to my original thought here. They did not have a cap for my growler and told me to go to Schlafly. (I was on my bike so filling it up and not capping it wasn't really an option). Seems like bad business to me, no? The server was nice, but there I was with a twenty dollar bill and they whiffed on not having something so simple as a cap and then whiffed again with their less than creative solutions. Oh, I just remembered they told me to go to Schlafly, get a cap from them, and come back - - a solution they had implemented before. \n\nA \"solution\" I should say. It's disappointing that this problem has come up for them in the past and they have not resolved it. \n\nTisk Tisk. \n\nIf only I could get beer from 6Row, 4Hands, Schalfly, ITAP, Budweiser, or Culinaria and bring it to their Patio. ...then this place would be 5 stars (and there would be more consistency with the lousy business strategy idea I flirted with above).",

I don't know if that's typical that it's so hot in there but it seems like I'm always sweating like crazy when I sit down in this place which makes eating much harder to me. This place is divey and right near my house so I want to love it. The food I've tried has been middle of the road bar food but it's obviously a local favorite so maybe I need to find the right stuff on the menu. A dude outside yelled at us when we pulled in the first time about parking which was apparently in a bad spot we didn't notice any signs about. No big deal, we'll move, but whoever was hammered sitting outside that yelled at us really started the first visit off on the wrong foot and ticked us off. The next visits we found street parking but it is obviously challenging sometimes in the area to find a spot when it's busier. TVs are a plus for sports so I'm sure there will be many more visits and hopefully the experience will get better. The cocktails at least have been good and the staff seem great. I'm sitting middle of the road crossing fingers it turns from 3 to 5 stars with more visits.",

I had an original roast beef (hot) smothered in cheddar and Italian vinegar oil. Kids had: 7th street Sicilian and a turkey and cheese... The deli is right in a cute neighborhood with a hometown feel (very close to the 44/55 highway though so it's easy to get to).  Lunchtime was super busy with a line out the door but SO worth it!  The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with the menu items as well. Love this place!! :)",

Until you get inside, you have no idea what their theme is...it's apparently a wine bar, but...I was smacked in the face by the smell of BBQ.\nThey wanted $4 for a Miller Lite, $7 for a Guinness.  I knew that if they were boasting THE BEST BLOODY IN NEW HOPE that they probably wanted your first born and $14.  I saw one of these so-called best bloodys and it was not impressive.\nMy biggest gripe?  The service!  We go to sit down and the bartender abruptly says \"someone's sitting there.\" and walks away kind of calling over her shoulder 'you can sit at one of those tables' - nah thanks...just stopped in for a drink...were about to leave but people moved over to accommodate us.\nWe sat for another 5 minutes or so...finally we order two Miller Lites.  They seriously were playing Madonna's Like a Prayer album front to back...that was so strange for me...I love me some Cherish, but with the corny \"wine\" decor and that album, I thought I was on a the set of a 1989 sitcom. \nWe ask for the check and the bartender can barely hide her disdain with a thin lipped smile and a \"only those two Miller Lites?\" Yes honey, get me the fug outta here!\n\n\nOnly one women's room and it was fairly empty for a holiday weekend.  The dining room was maybe at 1/4 capacity yet I heard the server make a couple wait to be seating \"so the kitchen can catch up\" - I'm glad I won't be returning to see how they can catch up with a full house!",

  "text": "Oh God. \n\nWhere to even begin. Chinese buffet? More like Russian roulette. \n\nAt least two times during our lunch visit, each person at the table spit something out because it tasted spoiled or extremely questionable. \n\nI'm not usually a buffet person (unless it's Everest, which is in a different class), but it was New Year's Day, I was incredibly hungover, and I figured I couldn't hate myself any more than I already did, so bring on seven plates of fried rice.\n\nPlain and simple: this place is NOT good. It's just not. At buffets like this, you always have the questionable stuff. The way-too-perfect looking desserts that don't taste like anything and for some reason are ALL topped with rainbow sprinkles. The mystery chicken floating in liquid MSG. Whatever. I can take a pass on those if the staples are decent. But man, this place was gross.\n\nUsing the same tongs for every different sushi roll? Gross. The fishy smell of the sushi? Gross. The weird, black, hair-like things on some of the fish? WTF. It was like someone touched it with a dirty glove or didn't wash it properly. It was nasty. \n\nMy mom tried the oysters and spit them out. Her friend tried the kimchee and spit it out because it was completely soft and tasted rotten. \n\nThe crab rangoon weren't even worth taking. Super tiny and they tasted stale and reheated. Even the fried rice sucked. How do you mess up fried rice?\n\nOn top of the crummy quality of the food, they were understaffed. I felt terrible for our waitress carrying literally 20 stacked plates back at a time because there were no other servers. They were always out of something we needed - like silverware. \n\nAnd what grinds my gears most about these buffets is the automatic upcharge when they decide to put out crab legs. No way would I touch seafood from here, so why do I have to pay $15.99 for lunch when I don't even want crab legs? Though admittedly, my mom ate enough of them for all of us.\n\n2 stars because miraculously I'm not throwing up today. Would not return.",

Now that it's a taproom, I love it even more! Wonderful and varied selection of beers, and the staff are super friendly and awesome about giving you a taster before you commit. There are the usual options, such as beer flight, pint, growler, etc. - but they also allow you to purchase small 5 oz glasses of beer, which is nice if you want just a smidge more beer or one extra for your flight, but don't want to drink a full beer. Mulled wine was another one of their offerings the day we visited, and it was warm, smooth, and spiced just enough. \n\nFor the beer: the Vernal Minthe Stout was yum! I didn't think I'd like it, but it turned out to be my favorite - it tasted like a thin mint! The blackberry barleywine was also nice, with just enough fruitiness and not overly sweet. The lychee IPA was also quite nice. \n\nThey don't actually serve food other than popcorn and pretzels, but food trucks apparently make an appearance there (a sandwich truck was there the night we stopped by).  For a taproom, it is pretty family friendly - the grounds lend themselves well for little ones to move about, and they are cool about bringing in outside food. There is plenty of seating both indoors and out, so you're bound to find an area that's comfortable for you and your kiddos. \n\nThe indoor area is lovely, but if weather permits, I highly recommend enjoying your drink outdoors. They have a beautiful little courtyard, complete with some interesting forged iron and corn hole (which we played while we were there).",

  "text": "You can find Il Bel Lago at 11631 Olive Blvd, St Louis, MO 63141 in a suburb called Creve Coeur almost due West of St Louis as the crow flies. The restaurant is in a protruding part of a shopping center almost hidden by lit trees (not sure if it's due to the holidays or if they're always lit). Entrance is to the right as you go around the corner and parking is in the lot out front. The interior is upscale with an elegance usually reserved for fine dining, but the atmosphere had a younger, frenetic feel that I found quite refreshing. Apparently the restaurant's original name was Bellagio but there was some dispute with the owner's of the hotel that ended in a name change - lucky for me the food retained it's very good quality.\n\nThis is perhaps the best meal I've had throughout several visits to St Louis on business the last few years. Sue T (a friend and coworker) and  her husband Carl graciously took me to Il Bel Lago and introduced me to the chef, Frank Giovanni. Afterwards we were sent a nice \"combo\" style appetizer that featured a delicious lobster ravioli and a  veal tortellini with shitake mushrooms and peas. The flavors were both unusual and offered great contrast to each other.\n\nAs I always do, I tried some of the local craft brews rather than going with wine - in this case the Schlafly's Pale Ale won the lottery as my initial try - honestly I didn't care for it much, preferring the hoppy bitterness of an IPA - this was a bit too lagerish to me with a bit of an oily mouth-feel that didn't work for me. I also ordered a Caesar salad that had an anchovy nicely sandwiched in parmesan crustini. For my second brew I switched to a standby Ranger IPA.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Spaghetti Gamberi, Cozze & Vongole - homemade spaghetti (almost an angel hair) with gulf shrimp, fresh mussels and clams in a white wine light san marzano sauce. This was quite delicious with a good amount of fresh garlic that provided little bursts of flavors as you eat the pasta and sauce. Also, the shrimp were quite large and filling - absolutely love this dish.\n\nWe forwent the dessert but ended up with these little chocolate and creme (with some type of booze) parfaits that were quite good. Not on the menu, I think they called them chocolate cows or something similar?\n\nService at Il Bel Lago is quite exceptional - our server was knowledgeable, courteous and quick to deliver. We couldn't have asked for or expected better. Thank you Sue and Carl for introducing me to this place - I hope to be back!",

  "text": "Hands down, the best Greek food in Tucson. I am perplexed by some of the reviews concerning bad service. We have always been treated like family here. I know one of the owner's life story! The food is fantastic. I love Saganaki and it's served the right way here. Cooked in clarified butter first, then flamed table side. I can't describe the salty deliciousness! The fried calamari is done in olive oil, which adds to the flavor. It's always melt in your mouth tender. For entrees we always share. One order is the Garithes Pasalimani. Simply put, prawns sauteed in olive oil with fresh garlic, herbs, tomatoes and topped with Feta cheese. Whoever said that seafood and cheese doesn't go together needs to try this dish! I am very picky about any kind of seafood and I have never had a watery or fishy prawn here. Trust me, if I had, my review would be far different. Second, the classic gyros platter. Delicious, perfectly seasoned and rotisserie roasted gyros meat paired with wonderful pita, tzatziki sauce and the usual accompaniments. We usually order a Greek wine and the server's recommendations have never led us wrong. The baklava is simply everything it should be. Fresh phyllo, honey and nuts. The perfect way to end a Greek meal. A few years ago, we moved to the bar after dinner for drinks. I taught the bartender how to make a Grasshopper! Wonderful local place that we have patronized for years. Always fantastic food and service. For real Greek food in Tucson, I highly recommend Athens on Fourth.",

  "text": "Great place! I'm down for wine and cheese probably 90% of anytime, but this place is a smart concept of picking your wines, cheeses, and meats and just letting them do the work of putting them together and adding the extra that you don't think about. Can't really remember all that they added but I loved the candied pecans and orange pieces with a nice smelly cheese and our semi dry Riesling. \nYou think that this place is tiny just from walking in and seeing the space they have to choose your foods but when you walk outside and around the corner, they have this huge backyard and upstairs with tons of seating and a really chill vibe. My friend and I were there on a Monday night and there was a musician with a pretty decent sized crowd. \nLove this place, coming back soon when the cold weather stays.",

  "text": "My friends and I called just minutes before arriving at Harvest, and we were seated almost immediately. It is a modern/fine dining feel, but can be casual as well. There was live music playing on a Friday night. Our server was very engaging and personable. This restaurant is similar to Seasons 52, for the menu changes every 3 months with dishes inspired by season, but they have way more to offer on the menu that I can remember. The main difference to note is that they have a green concept with farm to table style using fresh and organic ingredients from over 70 local farmers markets. Not only that, but are eco-friendly in regards to using recycled products for other purposes in the restaurant. Also, each item on the menu is 500 calories or less, or slightly more as noted with a little plus sign. Aside it being healthier ingredients being put into your body, doesn't mean it is necessarily healthy. Plug in an app or two, a meal and dessert, drinks..you're looking at a 2000+ calorie meal. But who cares its dinner, and you're meant to indulge. So indulge..\n\nAll the food was proportioned pretty well. The flat bread was thin, but very large and came free with Yelp check in. It was yummy and shareable between 4 people. Spinach and Kale dip was creamy and delicious. I had the duck pot stickers, and I personally thought they were over fried and sort of bland. I did not care for the cranberry, and other sauce it was accompanied with. I absolutely loved the pumpkin ravioli. It is a sweet and savory dish, and very well balanced. Desserts are in shooter glasses and $3 each. Our server came to the table with a little tray displaying all desserts to choose from, always a great tactic. If you want one, which of course you do, she hands it to you right there. Genius! I'll take another. They are mostly a mousse, with a a little crumb or cake texture at the bottom.\n\nThe only negative was that the food did take a little longer to come out, but overall I thought it was a nice experience. I will come back again.",

  "text": "This is our 100th review! Woot, woot.\n\nI came to Agustin Kitchen for lunch with a friend today and had an absolutely delightful experience. We sat inside and highly enjoyed the modern, clean, and inviting decor. While the specials sounded delicious, I ordered the chicken chopped salad and my friend had the veggie burger. Both were completely amazing! The salad has dried papaya, grains (buckwheat I think), slivered almonds, cheese....and the champagne vinegarette was perfectly emulsed. YUM. The veggie burger on the new summer menu has a curry aioli, which really stands out. With filling entrees around $10-14, eating here at lunchtime is an excellent choice for the budget conscious foodie. I love that the atmosphere, waitstaff, food, plating and all the parts of this restaurant are unassuming and authentic. For a place as award winning as this, it welcomes all kinds of clientele and makes everyone feel at home. Totally on point! \n\nLooking forward to coming back for brunch...I saw a killer looking Bloody Mary on the way out....",

Like asking for no tomato and they are all over my meal - every time!!!\n\nAlso their staff always seems like they don't want to be there. Yes, I know it is work - and all of us wish we didn't have to...but a simple smile can go a long way!\n\nIn the end I always try to go to either the one in the Loop or in Webster Groves - the people are always friendly, they get my orders right, out faster then said and the locations always seem cleaner.",

It was pretty crowded, but even on a Saturday if you come a little early (okay, a lot early) you can get a table with minimal wait. I loved the gin drink - think it was called the Expectation. Or something that starts with an E. very refreshing and cucumbery. The artichoke dip is solid, but really, how do you screw that up? My ahi was tasty, but nothing spectacular. Service was a little slow, possibly because it was so friendly. I'd go back were it not that I really don't care to wait for stuff. Maybe on my next blue hair 5 pm dinner special.",

  "text": "My significant other loves teppanyaki, and I have to admit, I do too.  So, last night, we were in Reno for one night due to an early flight in the morning, we decided to try Ichiban since it has very good reviews, and we were staying at the Whitney Peak Hotel across the street.  \n\nSadly, the restaurant is in Harrah's, so you do have to brave a bit of cigarette smoke upon arrival, but once inside the restaurant, you do not notice this at all.   Regarding the restaurant itself, it is quite small - only about 8 teppanyaki tables, but the biggest teppanyaki tables I've ever seen.  They seat 12 people at each table.  Definitely great if you have a big group, other teppanyaki restaurants usually only seat 8.\n\nSo, if you've been to a Benihana or local place, you pretty much get the same set up.  Soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, entree with vegetables, fried or steamed rice and ice cream.   But we found Ichiban takes most of these to a new level.  They even make it feel more upscale by starting with warm towels to wash your hands.\n\nNow onto the food.  The soup was coined as \"miso\" but I dislike miso soup and rather enjoyed this one.  Next, the salad was cucumbers soaked in some delicious sweet rice vinegar with a few strands of imitation crab.  I rather enjoyed this twist!  Next they don't just do shrimp appetizer, they offer calamari as well.  We both had the shrimp and were pleasantly surprised by the sauce they put on them and that they were mixed with snow peas - SO DELICIOUS!  The chef then made the mixed veggies, which was a bit of onion, bean sprouts, carrots, etc.  They were actually very tasty.\n\nFor the entrees, they were pretty standard, we had shrimp, lobster and scallops with fried rice.  All was very good and we left stuffed and satisfied.   We skipped dessert.\n\nCouple of notes, this was a very long experience.  Because the tables are large, this was a full two + hour experience.  Don't be in a rush, you will get frustrated.  Another note, the chef's here were probably the best we've seen.  They had really unique tricks and knife skills.  We even saw one juggling with two things on fire at a table across the way.",

I usually hate veggie wraps, because I generally don't like cold roasted vegetables in bread (really, that's a lame excuse for a sandwich) but this was not that!! It was broccoli, carrots, onion, zucchini, and black bean hummus, and it had a lot of flavor and texture going for it. It was a cold sandwich that was actually intended to be eaten cold. I love that it was already vegan, and I didn't have to remove cheese from my order and thus remove any shred of flavor I had a shot at. Good choice for delivery or a quick takeout order.",

  "text": "I have seen the signs, the paper on the windows, and the very large store front staring back at me at Southgate Mall for months now.  My curiosity peaked yesterday as I walked by and saw people running around, setting up, doors open, but customers unable to go in.  And now.....Finally.  Its here.  Crate and Barrell's opening day!  \n\n     I was greeted by two very friendly girls handing out Scratch and Wins at the entrance with the possibility of winning $20,000 (yes that is the correct amount of zeros!) in the store.  I won $10.  Every little bit helps!  Especially when you have a love of furniture and house \"stuff\" like I do.  This store is HUGE!  They have attempted to set it up into sections that flow into each other.....upholstery, bedding, desks, dining, into kitchen, appliances, holiday, decor.  There is a lot to look at here and a lot of different styles.  The furniture is bright in some selections, muted in others, leather, fabric, sofas, sectionals, double chairs, single chairs.  Truly, there is so much and something for every taste.  I was very impressed with how many item tags I looked at and found \"North American sourced\" and \"Eco friendly\".  One \"leather\" chair in particular that I liked was actually made of Soy!  I am always wary of box stores as I am on a \"buy local\" or at least \"buy North American\" lifestyle, so I am very happy to find a furniture store that I can customize and find things at right in the middle of a mall!  \n    I ended up leaving with some tea light holders and a placemat for a hallway table upstairs.  I also left with future plans of buying a rug, curtains, a desk and a living room chair one day.  Prices are mid-range for furniture and some items can run a bit high (700-2100 for a living room chair, $500-$3000 for a dining room table) but they seem to be of a good quality, although I cannot say for sure until my dog has slept on it, I have spilled a drink on it, and it has met my vacuum many many times.  Hopefully that will happen in the future to a particular green double chair I have my eye on.  \n    The check out process was a bit painful but I chalk it up completely to first day kinks.  Their debit was down (it happens to everyone!!) so I had to leave and come back with cash.  No biggie!  I left with 40$ worth of stuff for $30 thanks to my 10$ gift card!  There is also a wedding registry and if I believed in wedding registries, this would be a place I would register!  But I do not believe in registries, so, if anyone at my wedding is reading this, gift certificates to this store would be very welcome gifts if you planned on getting us anything.  :)",

  "text": "People know me for my high heels and penchant for expensive cookies. I like being just so fresh, so clean, and generally take my sangria on a Southern California patio with my ladies in maxi dresses and wedges. Don't hate. It's just how I work hard to roll. \n\nBut, I grew up in the mountains and camping with my family. I can build a fire, I can build a fort, I can shoot a gun, and I'll bet I could chop some wood if I absolutely had to. If the apocalypse was upon us, you'd want my tasty cast iron pan skills all up in your shelter making mean ass cowboy stew. Just sayin. \n\nThe girlfriends and I decide that we should take a break from our status quo and start a new tradition: Gourmet Camping once a year- and so, the 2014 crew of myself, The Polish Princess of P.O.P., The Master Chef Selary and The Sexy School Teacher took a trip up North for a couple days. We packed the car all by ourselves too. (Keep reading for actual campsite info-hey, story telling is a camping tradition right?) \n\nThe menu? Gourmet indeed. From fire kissed meatballs wrapped in onions over bacon cheese hash followed by marshmallows stuffed with rolos toasted into cookie smores to crepes with blueberries and paninis with mozzarella and spinach: WE dines like the queens of the forest. We made campfire pie oven biscuits and corn on the cob with roasted tri tip stew and mini apple pies. \n\nOur tent was a virtual nest-we made micheladas and sangria and played card games by lantern light. We checked in Saturday and stayed till Monday AM. \n\nIt all sounds lovely, and it was-except for a few things: \n\nThe drought: Not the campsites fault at all-but it was dry as a bone out there. The allure of the creeks and rivers caused us to make a reservation there-but they were at least a 5 mile drive to find, a disappointing turn of events. The campsite this dry is very dirty and dusty. Any other time and with more moisture it would have been perfect because of the big oak trees and shade and greenery-but California just isn't surviving this situation very well. \n\nExpensive ass firewood. 6 dollars for a small bundle. They don't want you bringing in outside wood-so its a racket. \n\nThere was a water pump, but no showers, bathrooms were okay. We could smell them though so EW.  About 20 miles inland from Santa Barbara so it was in the 80's and pretty humid-I dont suggest it at all for summer months. \n\nOn the weekends it's full of peeps, but spaced out. Sunday night caused the grounds to empty and left us alone with just a few other campers. You can still have fires here as of July 2014-but I expect them to ban them shorty with how dry and crispy it is out there. \n\nSite # 25 is a good location that's mostly shaded and near the water, but downwind from the bathrooms. This campground is the 3rd one along Paradise Road and more spacious than the others. \n\n#gourcamping2014 ended up being just ok, kinda like this campground. Next year we might just pitch a tent next to the patio here in SD and call it good-but who knows? The adventure bug might bite me again. Just like the mosquitoes from this weekend. \n\nPS: those who know me IRL, ask me about the harrowing night #2 titled \"Almost Dying In The Forest\"",

It was DELICIOUS! \nI'm not sure if the chicken is better, I'd say it's on par or equal to, however the side items are way better! The Mac n cheese was amazing, the slaw is seriously the best slaw I ever ever had in Nashville, and the baked beans were really good. You HAVE TO GET THE SLAW!! It's so delicious. It's chopped really fine, and it's creamy, instead of being the long stringy kind. And it's perfect to absorb the spices of the chicken, cause your mouth will be on fire! \n\nBolton's spice level is higher than other hot chicken I've tried.  The mild is actually very spicy. It was perfect for me (I usually order medium at hattie Bs for comparison).  The medium at Bolton's was too spicy for me! If you're a wuss with spice, they also have no spice or extra mild. But the mild was perfect for me. \n\nThe prices are Right... cheaper than other hot chicken places around. But, the atmosphere isn't the greatest, it's kind of run down which is ok, but I really would love a beer with my chicken, but they don't serve alcohol. I wonder if I can BYO? But, Overall, delicious. I never had the fish so I can't comment on that, but I love the tenders and the side items!",

Heck even Copa has like a dozen these days, how about rotating a few new flavors. Great on the new Guacamole selections, but it shouldn't have been at the expense of the salsa. Manchego still rules, but the cactus and crab is way too oily, and the citrus tuna one was unavailable last time I was in (seriously - unavailable? someone forgot to shop?) \n\nThe other downturn is with the fajitas. The old presentation sent them out to the table steaming and sputtering. A lot of show? Of course, but that smell. I'd order them and in five minutes three others would too. These day's they're tasty, but the mystique of that lovely sizzli smoke is nowhere to be found. \n\nYeah, they have lots of tequila. Yay. I'm a Negro Modela man myself, so I'm content there. Black bass taco's and Mahi-Mahi tacos shouldn't be missed - simply delicious. \n\nBut not a lot to rave about. It's the same old concept with retreaded salsa, and not a whole bunch like they used to have, with a few new guacamole's. I agree if it's broke don't fix it, but come on guys - you're a Starr joint, run some seasonal offerings through or some new specials or something. You're food's good, we're just bored with the same old dishes! \n\nAnd telling us you can't get the sizzling grills is just absurd. I can google them up on the net in about 4.3 seconds - spend some cash and get the right ones back in!",

I L-O-V-E the house band Brazil Billy, they mix up country with a little bit of rockabilly, to end up with the perfect dancing concoction. They play some Cash covers, with tons of style. Pretty much everyone can go here and have a good time, regardless of whether you consider yourself a fan of country music or not. I always bring out of town visitors here on saturday nights, and I have heard nothing but praise from everyone. The bar itself is narrow but long, and it has an upstairs. It gets fairly crowded, but never too crowded to do a little dancing and meet nice folks. I love this bar!",

The Chris Casello trio was playing the majority of the night and I absolutely loved them! They are such an amazing and talented band! My cousin had a great time for her birthday and her man even got the band and the bar to sing happy birthday for her. Also, the cheeseburger with chips I ordered was very tasty and delicious, I'd come back just for the food alone but everything about this place was awesome. Being from Seattle, I was definitely out of my element, but the people and the environment are so dang inviting, it's hard not to start stomping your boots around after just a short time! I'd love to come back!",

Because I LOVE Shake Shack!\n\nI didn't even know they had Shake Shack in Philly, so when I passed by it after dinner I had to go in. I dragged my entire entourage of now 8 people to come with me, and also convinced them to have burgers because they had never tried it before even though they live in Philly.\n\nO.M.G.\n\nSorry but I love Shake Shack. I think it's way better than In n' Out (I might get massively flamed for this ... ) and I loved it here with no exceptions. Just talking about it makes me miss it :(!",

I was greeted by a clean environment and very friendly staff! The person who fulfilled my order was awesome and gave me good suggestions as it was my first visit.\n\nI went with the rice bowl, half chicken half pork, spring veggie mix, pickled onions, cucumber and tomato mix. I couldn't decide between sauces so the woman gave me the roasted red pepper and spicy cilantro to try on the side. I loved the roasted red pepper sauce!! Soo good. Next time I probably won't get the cucumber tomato mix in my bowl, but on the side. Loved it but just not with everything else in the bowl.\n\nI will definitely be back! I have enough for lunch tomorrow, and for $8.75 (what I would have paid if it wasn't free), that's worth it to me! And it was DELICIOUS!",

  "text": "I love this place! It's unique, simple in its concept but complex in the options you can have. It's also VERY yummy. \n\nFood: Delicious! Many options inspired by several types of cuisines. Bowls based on the mediterranean, the pacific, and asia all in one place. You can pick healthy options from brown rice vs white to having no rice (spaghetti squash). I have been missing poke bowls since I left Hawaii and this place delivers!! Think of it as a fancy poke bowl...but not so fancy that it loses the point. \n\nAtmosphere: Bright, modern, fun, and clean. Outside seating on the walkway area around the strip mall. Dining room seating at casual places. Bar side seating with the casual bar feel. \n\nService: Welcoming, friendly, and casual. We sat at the bar and had a very friendly and talkative bartender who was not only patient with us but was also enthusiastic about the place and all the options we could choose. She even went out of her way to get me an ingredient from the back for my poke bowl without acting annoyed at all. \n\nBottom line: Go here to please everyone you are with and enjoy a fun time eating good food.",

The menu is so creative, the execution was almost flawless (a few oversalted dishes), the experience at the kitchen/bar made it even better.\n\nThe standouts were the freeze dried foie gras, great texture and amazing quality of foie; aged ribeye was so tender, no knife needed; a dish consisting of broth, freeze dried rice, custard and caviar, it was so rich and flavorful; perfect combination of liquid-custard-crunch-salt-gelatin.\n\nThe drinks are also spectacular, they have a small bar to work with, but the execution (again) was awesome.\n\nThe flavors we experienced here are heavily asian, alot of ingredients you wouldn't experience with this type of food (seaweed, dashi, etc.). \n\nI love this place so much. do it.",

  "text": "Very simple and unassuming place, but the food is delish. The first time I went, I got the lunch special which is 1/2 po' boy + a soup/salad. I got a fish po'boy with the crab and corn bisque. Creamy, buttery perfection. My husband got the same thing but with seafood gumbo, it's not as memorable for me, but he seemed to love it. Oh, almost forgot to talk about the po'boy, the fish was perfectly seasoned, came out steaming hot, and definitely tasted fresh. So no complaints there!\n\nNow the second time I went is what compelled me to write this review. I ordered the Uptown BBQ shrimp, which was peeled shrimp in Cajun spices and butter, and this was AMAZING. My pro tip here is to dip your po'boy into the buttery concoction after you're done with the shrimp. Thank me later!! So good, and the service is prompt and very courteous. The po'boy was just as good as the first time too, so now we know their food is consistent. \n\nThe Catch's nearly perfect reviews is well worth it.",

  "text": "Another review summarized it well - they have fantastic food that is very cheap there. In addition, you can acquire all of your standard corner store food supplies there for basically the price you would expect.\n\nAs a Mississippian, I am used to being able to walk into neglected looking gas station and being able to obtain some of the finest food available to humanity. As someone who likes to travel, I have come to realize this is a luxury not afforded outside of my home state as much as I am used to. Hank's is a beacon of food and hope on the edge of the 8th and 9th wards.\n\nI was led to this location by an old friend who has been living deeply immersed in New Orleans for a few years now. He has always had a strong NOLA network and knows the ins and outs of his side of town pretty well. I arrived at Hank's confident of it's pedigree.\n\nInside you find a reasonably large last station based market. Pick up a snack or a drink or a beer for your walk here - it's hot outside.\n\nWhere Hank's shines, however, is the cooked food. Again, I'll roll out my Mississippi roots. We produce something like 143% of the worlds catfish and consume an additional 276% of it. We know fried catfish. We love fried catfish. We bleed and breath the stuff. We will fight you over catfish. Hank can fry some damn good catfish. For basically no money, you can leave Hanks with a bag FULL of the stuff. I believe the price was $1 for 2 fillets. The catfish I had there was the softest, flakiest, butteriest catfish that has ever melted on my palate. You would be remiss not to stop by if you needed a snack!",

  "text": "My amazing stylist, Melissa called me one day and told me she was moving to a salon I've never heard of before, nonetheless ventured this far into Old City before; however, with that being said, Melissa's talent with hair, especially having me, someone who loved having long hair feel so much more confident in short hair now is worth even flying 50,000 miles for.\n\nWhen I say Barnet Fair is possibly one of the most beautiful salons I've ever been to, it's the truth. With the beautiful exposed brick walls to how open the area is with the quirky decor, I think I fell in love the moment I stepped into the salon and walked out with a cute pin that a lovely receptionist told me I can have. \n\nBack to the hair goddess herself Melissa though -- Melissa has been styling my hair for two years now and she is the first and only stylist I've had that made me feel so much more beautiful when it comes to chopping off my usual dead, long, lifeless hair that went way pass my bum all the way up my shoulders. I used to have anxiety attacks when it came to even chopping an inch off my hair but when Melissa came along, I sat down in her chair and let her discover things about myself I never knew. Melissa is so open and friendly, also she listens to what you want rather than doing what she thinks you'd like, only to possibly have you cry. I showed Melissa a photo that I wanted to copy and without even taking another glance at it, she went to work on my hair and I was stunned at how beautiful and quickly her hands were. I would recommend anyone who's ready to make a huge change in their life go to Melissa. I honestly trust her with not only my hair but my confidence that expanded due to her.\n\nBarnet Fair made an amazing decision to have another talented stylist on their team that I will not stop advertising!",

  "text": "So I've been here a couple of times and I've also had a try of their baked goods at corporate events a couple of times as well. Location wise, it's pretty good that's it's off Jasper Ave. & close to the legislature grounds. Parking wise, not that great, but most patrons are downtown workers who walk over. I like how there is outdoor seating, inside though, is pretty tight, it barely allows for traffic flow between prep station counter to tables. Seating does fill up rather quickly during the lunch hour too. I did see a washroom in the corner near the side entrance too. They have a chic shelving space with nice items to browse & a lovely display of baked goods while you wait in line, but it doesn't take too long to get your order in. I do wish pricing was listed on the baked goods on display. If you order just a drink, the service is a ton faster than ordering food. Mind you, the food is worth the extra 5-10 minute wait.  They even do drink art on your hot drink & there's a drink additions/waiting station with some seating to linger around while waiting for your order. If you order made-to-order food, you get a order number flag. I ordered takeout of a large chai latte & the today's special of mushroom, hollandaise & poached egg tartine. Came to just under $20 including tip...yes it's a pretty hefty price for a deconstructed sandwich & drink, but it was very delicious & not too heavy. Service wasn't too bad, a little bit slower with lunch rush. The server walked my food over to me rather than me having to pick up at counter. The baked goods are always a win here in my books and I'll probably be back here from time to time for a treat & a drink because my co-workers also like this place.",

I've been a faithful customer for about 5 years, now, and seriously cannot sing this thrift store's praises enough. \n\nNot only do they have a huge selection of used (and cheap!) costumes, but they also have a very extensive collection of accessories (used and new).  I recommend coming to this store if you have no idea what you want to be for Halloween- just because they have a ton of stuff to give you ideas. It's also a great store to go to for theme parties, because you can be sure you won't be spending a ton of money for a last-minute costume. \n\nThe staff is always (and I mean always) helpful, and a few employees have gone out of their way to search for items, even if it took them 10 minutes. Also a big bonus over other costume stores: it's open year-round, and is consistently well stocked.",

It's a very lovely, family owned and run Italian Restaurant. It's a wonderful place to enjoy a quiet lunch with friends or a romantic dinner with your significant other. Nice dining rooms with linen tablecloths abound! Now the food. Just about any Italian dish one can think of, is available. Of course, I have tried their Eggplant Parmigiana, and It's very, very good. Their red sauce is very pleasant. Veal Scallopini and their Francaise dishes are wonderful too. Alfano's offers  a variety of fixe prix lunch dishes and early dinners that include select wines for an additional $5 . The meal offers a salad, entree and dessert. The lunch choices are $16 and the dinner $22. During the evening, the vibe is quite vibrant and lively. They usually have live music in the bar. Alfano's is a full service restaurant and also has a wonderful full service bar. They have a very extensive wine list and they make great cocktails too! The  decor is quite interesting, so if possible, try to spend a few minutes checking it out. By the way, Alfano's, in keeping with their love and respect for family, is closed on Sundays, unless otherwise announced.",

It was amazing!\n\nDrinks - We ordered a bottle of the Chanti which was really good, and then a couple bottles of another drink that tasted like a blackberry wine. I am unsure of what it was called but it was really good!\n\nFood - The main reason you come here, all the choices of meat! I didn't eat one bad thing, however the ones I loved the most was the bulgoki and I think the other was a teriyaki marinade! They were both full of flavor and absolutely delicious!\n\nService - It was slow and late at night. It took a while for us to get seated which was a little odd since it was so empty, but once we were seated the service was fantastic. They were constantly refilling our meat choices, refilling the ban chan and serving us drinks.\n\nOverall - For a first time experience this was great! I left completely full and fully satisfied with the entire experience! I would gladly recommend this restaurant to any of my friends who end up visiting the area!",

  "text": "Double Knot is another fantastic concept by the wonderful chef Michael Schulson. Connected to Sampan, the top floor was crowded at the few tables and around the bar on a Friday night. Luckily, we had a reservation, and we were evaded the bustling upstairs and were seated at an table in the intimate basement level. Downstairs, it was equally as crowded, with patrons filling every table, and a very \"weekend\" vibe with the dim lighting and close quarters. \n\nOur server, Dustin, was a wonderful server! He suggested a wine for us, which we absolutely loved. He talked us through the menu, and let us mull over our options. We opted to do the tasting menu. For $60 a person, the table chooses ten dishes - 1 from each section of the menu, but 2 from the robatayaki - to share. While tasting dishes typically leave you hungry, this was the complete opposite. While some dishes were small, others came out in grandiose portions, and by the end of the meal, we were STUFFED. We didn't even finish the last few dishes, although everything was incredible!\n\nTUNA RICE CRACKER - cold // This dish was full of flavor, but the textural contrast is what takes it to the next level. A brick of crispy rice, which is chewy on the inside, is topped with a cool dollop of spicy tuna, with a sweet glaze. The bite ranges from soft to crispy to chewy all at once, and is a textural party in your mouth!\n\nSALMON - specialty sashimi // Thinly sliced pieces of fresh salmon, in a spicy ponzu sauce and topped with soy ginger + scallions. This dish lets the fresh salmon do the talking!\n\nTOFU - crispy // Normally tofu goes unnoticed while on the table, if people even order it at all. But not this tofu! This tofu is fried until it is extremely crispy on the outside, but with a pillowy interior that disintegrates in your mouth. The tofu has two sauces: a pesto and a miso caramel, which both stand out against the mild tofu. Even those who were opposed to ordering tofu helped scarf down this crispy delicacy! \n\nEDAMAME DUMPLING - small // These little dumps were adorable! The dumplings had a smooth, mild filling made with ground edamame. The flavor was very mellow, yet intriguing. Apparently these are one of the best sellers at Double Knot.\n\nCHICKEN BREAST - robatayaki // Probably the least impressive dish in the meal. The chicken was cooked well, but lacked an explosive flavor compared to the other dishes. \n\nRIB EYE SCALLION - robatayaki // This was INCREDIBLE, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like steak. The rib eye was so incredibly tender and juicy, it just melted in the mouth after the first bite. It was topped with a green scallion sauce that was so dynamite, it could have bene paired with cardboard and I'd eat it. Definitely the robatayaki to get!\n\nBEEF SHORT RIB - meat // This was MASSIVE. And so DELICIOUS. The short rib comes to the table whole, and is shredded in front of you. The meat is succulent in the flavorful miso sauce. It's served with lettuce cups and white rice to make lettuce wraps, or you can just jab it with your fork and shovel as much as you possibly can into your mouth.\n\nBROILED SEABASS - fish // By the time this dish came, we were filling up, and I don't think it got the attention it deserved. The seabass was cooked to just past the point of being raw (aka perfect), with glistening insides and a truffle soy glaze on the plate. A simple, understated, perfectly cooked fish. \n\nCRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS - sides // These were good, but not great. The brussels are super crispy, which I loved, and served in a salty fish sauce. While I typically love brussels served like this, I felt the sauce was a bit too pungent or salty, and it made it hard to eat a lot of these.\n\nSPICY TUNA ROLL - sushi // Standard, spicy tuna roll. Fresh fish. \n\nMOCHI // The tasing menu comes with complimentary mochi. We had two flavors: black sesame and strawberry. These mochi were on the bigger side, with a chewy exterior. The strawberry was a little too sweet for me, but the black sesame tasted like a more mild peanut butter. So delicious and unexpected!!\n\nDouble Knot is definitely a spot I will be back to. Will I need to do the tasting menu again? Perhaps, but it was a lot of food. If I were to do it again, I would let the chef choose the menu so I could try some dishes I wouldn't normally. There's tons to chose from the expansive menu, and it's perfect for a weekend dinner or a date night.",

  "text": "The place is fancy! Looks fancier on the inside than out. We were just walking around international mall and wanted to try a new place for dinner. I searched on google and saw that ocean prime was a really close one we hadn't been to before. We had to drive to it even though it's less than a mile from international mall, there's kind of no way to walk to it. There's outdoor self parking spaces and valet parking available. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately, we didn't mind whatever seating option became first available. They do have a main \"dining\" area with live music, a covered patio area and an area close to the patio area (which is where we sat). The temperature inside was VERY cold. Other than that it was nice. \n\nThe staff is so friendly and service is amazing. Big thanks to our server Cristy, she was SO sweet, attentive, and knowledgeable. \n\nThe food! I was surprised at how good everything tasted! Every single thing I tried was amazing. \n\nI tried the lobster bisque, it was so good. Love how they brought it out with just the lobster meat at first then poured the bisque on it. It was so smooth and creamy. Hearts of romaine salad was yummy too, but it was my least favorite out of all. \n\nGoat cheese ravioli was really unique, I'd definitely get it again. I like goat cheese in general but never had it in ravioli form. Also, I don't know what sauce it came with but it was really good. \n\nCalamari was nice and crispy. Filet minion was made perfectly, had a Smokey flavor, I didn't really like the presentation though. Black truffle Mac and cheese was heavenly cheesy goodness. \n\nThe butter cake... no matter how I describe it, the description will never match the real thing. The warm softness of the most moist cake along with the cold creamy ice cream. Cake compliments of the chef since it was my moms birthday. \n\nAll in all my favorites, in order:\nButter cake\nLobster bisque\nBlack truffle Mac and cheese\nGoat cheese ravioli",

  "text": "I was super excited to see a Club Pilates come to Mass Ave because it is in walking distance to where I live and I love reformer. I did one of their free classes during their grand opening to check it out. It is a pretty small  place but in the actual pilates room, there was plenty of room. About 12 reformers and a bunch of other equipment and everything was brand new. \n\nThe class itself was pretty good. Because it was a free class, I think it was more of an introductory class because everything was pretty basic and nothing was overly challenging. I would like to go back and try another class to see if it would be different. The instructor was great though! It was a bit distracting however, when people walk into the studio because you can see straight into the reception area. I think the only thing that would stop me from going is cost because it is pretty pricey. All in all, good experience and if you go  to check it out, make sure to bring your sticky socks!",

  "text": "Ok, I would love to give this place a solid 5 stars, because the ribs just blew me away with their fantastic-ness (and I'm from NC, aka BBQ south). But the prices are ridiculously expensive ($5.50 per a single rib - make no mistake, not a rack. Aka $11 for two pieces of rib). Yep, you read that correctly.\n\nMaybe they have on/off days based on the mixed reviews, but my order (via delivery) tasted incredible:\n\n+ St. Louis ribs - the ribs in particular were just divine - rich in flavor, tender and not dry at all, perfectly crisped/charred outer skin, big bones & helping of meat on each rib. The smoked taste came through prominently but didn't overwhelm the delicious rib meat. On top of that, you can see the quality and artistry that went into butchering/prepping.\n\n+ Burnt end baked beans - super flavorful, rich/caramelized flavor with a little bit of meat. Also A+\n\n+ Bourbon pecan pie ($4) - good old-fashioned pecan pie. Can't really go wrong.\n\n...the caveat is the PRICE, as mentioned. Ribs come w/ some equally amazing sauce and  decent rolls, but when I received my delivery I thought they had made a mistake when I unwrapped 2 paltry ribs for $11. Nope. Likewise for the other meats here I imagine. And it's especially astonishing, given how cheap and plentiful good BBQ is outside the state, granted maybe not as tasty by a margin. \n\nSo as much as the food here amazed me, I can't really give it 5/5. I used a coupon via the new delivery service (UberEats, use eats-dianax for $10 off) so my meal ended up being ~$11, but as much as I'd like to have a taste of those ribs/beans again, my wallet would hate me.",

  "text": "Update (only on ramen): \n\nEdmonton's ramen race has begun. There's been an influx of ramen lately, from pop ups to storefronts and I could not ask for anything else for my hometown - ramen is my absolute favourite thing to eat. Hands down. Ohana Ya Japanese Restaurant in St. Albert is the latest to serve up ramen, an addition to their sushi centric menu. Unlike its competitor across the road with Saturday lunch-only ramen, Ohana Ya offers ramen during the weekdays for the lunch rush. Who would have thought that St. Albert would have a small ramen culture of their own!\n\nFive kinds of ramen are offered, $11 a bowl: shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), miso (soy bean paste), tonkotsu (pork bone broth), and tan tan (spicy sesame minced pork with peanuts, $12). All bowls, except for the tan tan, are served with char siu, bamboo shoots, beansprouts, sweet corn, fungus, and a boiled egg. For an additional $2, you get two extra pieces of char siu, and for an extra $1, you can have an extra side item. I assume that means another egg.\n\nJosh was my lunch date this time around, his (questionable) first time eating ramen! He ordered the tonkotsu ramen and paid extra for the char siu. The noodles aren't made in house but were wavy, good consistency, and one of the better noodles I've had in Edmonton and area. Ohana Ya at least is sourcing delicious noodles! A sip of the broth gave me a taste of creamy, rich, and salty pork bone broth. I understand that an \"under-seasoned broth is a crime\" (high-five to you, fellow ramen lover, if you know where that quote is from), but whoa. It was a touch harder to finish and drink the broth near the end.\n\nI ordered the miso ramen, the fermented soy bean paste a favourite style of mine. The char siu was moist and very nicely done. I hate it when I get lean char siu in ramen. The half egg was medium-hard boiled and very lightly marinated. The menu pictured different bowls, one with a perfectly cooked soft-medium boiled egg, whereas the next photo showed a hard-boiled one. I'm going to assume that the kind of egg you get is a surprise! I really enjoyed my bowl, a good portion and loaded with toppings. I appreciated the two different kinds of seaweed.\n\nI would have preferred for a slightly less salty broth to enjoy the bowl from start to finish, but otherwise it was a solid bowl of ramen for a good value. As they just started offering their ramen menu, hopefully this was just a part of the kinks that need to be ironed out. Comparing it to Yuzen's weekend ramen is a hard sell, seeing that you'll never have to choose between the two on a given day. Ramen is a labour intensive dish to make and I appreciate Ohana Ya Japanese Restaurant for serving it up daily, let alone offer five different kinds. Definitely a must visit when you're in the area or if you have a free weekday lunch. Try it out!",

  "text": "Good morning my fellow Yelpers! I thought long and hard about this review so bare with me! So, I'm a woman of a \"certain\" age: (read 53) and besides going under the knife for a facelift (not there yet LOL, maybe another 10 years) I've tried every procedure you can imagine to tighten my skin, address my jowls and give my neck a little tightening refresh. You feel me ladies? I won't bore you with all the procedures I've tried. I will however, tell you what drives me batshit insane ( and has taken me years to realize because I guess I'm not that sharp). Is when you go for a cosmetic consultation and advise what is bothering you and what you really want some help with, again in my case (drooping skin around my cheeks, jowls and neck) and what they say will \"absolutely work\" for you is what they have in their office!!! Are you following me here? Not, oh sorry we 'd love to help you but this $500 chemical peel will solve the problem, or microdermasion is just what you need to lift those jowls. How about..... no sorry that's not a\ngood fit for you but I might have a solution for you to investigate. DONT sell me something I DONT want or need to line your pockets. I'm not rich! I work to save up for these procedures. I work hard for my money and the sad part is I would more than likely come back to you for that chemical peel or dermabrasion if you were just honest from the beginning!!!  Am I making sense here ladies (and gents) I don't expect miracles or to look 30 again (heavy sigh) but I do expect some form of straight up honesty and realistic expectations. Don't even get me started with Ultherapy. Very Painful and in my opinion waste of money. Maybe for other issues so I don't want to totally knock it but certainly not a success for me. (NOT cheap either)!  So with all that said LOL, I think I did some pretty intense research this time not only on the latest procedures but practitioners which is where Dr. Lisa at LaChele comes into the picture. My consultation was with Dr Espinoza. She took one look at me and knew what I needed. Facetite for my jowls and Morpheus 8 to treat fine lines and wrinkles. ( Read up on the procedures folks) BUT, it's not just the machine/apparatus you need an experienced practitioner who has a artists eye. I got that from Lisa right away. I was very nervous so I barely heard a word she said during the first consultation LOL. I must have called back 5 times and spoken with either Lisa or Melissa who ALWAYS called me back, didn't make me feel like a high maintenance pain in the ass and very directly set my expectations. Absolutely no hard sell here just a straight up assessment of what to expect. It was my decision to make. I had the procedure done this past Monday 1/11 because I needed some thing to boost my confidence and forget about 2020. I am very swollen ( to be expected) no bruising at all and I bruise easy. I'm not sure if that had to do with the MEND supplement they recommended (picture below) but I'm glad I bought it. In my package I have two more Morpheus sessions so I will set these up in the next few months. Oh, and one last thing the facetite was a breeze. Completely numbed, didn't feel a thing and the Xanax , well what can I say, Xanax fixes everything. My only constructive criticism would be to numb the face again next time before the Morpheus. That my friends was a little painful.  Next time I will ask for more numbing on the Morpheus but Lana was fantastic. Here are some pics (three days) after and a few prior to the procedure but for the first time I feel hopeful. Sit down before you see the price and take a deep breath.....$4,700. Yes, I know!!! I will certainly follow up in a few months to hopefully see it was worth it. Thank you, Lisa, Melissa and Lana. You guys are a GREAT CREW and I have high hopes. My very best, Kim Butner",

  "text": "Been here three times now, and 2 out of 3 were very good experiences (once during dinner we had a server that was really not in the mood, but the food was still good). Location is pretty strategic, restaurant area of the mall, and I can't really complain about how bad Brandon Mall parking and traffic is, that's not the restaurant's fault. They are located very near the parking lot so that's a plus. \n\nWe were a party of 5 for lunch on a Friday and were seated outside. The server takes a bit of time but hey, it's lunchtime. We had calamari and coconut shrimp, both of which were fantastic. The dip for the coconut shrimp was very flavorful, sweet but has a little kick to it, reminds me a little of Thai sweet chili sauce made less spicy. For my drink, I got their Strawberry mojito, which I believe is a great choice for people with a sweet tooth (guilty). The seafood paella was next in my list, and I loved the flavor and texture of the rice. The serving was humongous so I had to take half home. I was happy about the proportion of rice to seafood, and the clams visually brought the dish together. \n\nAnd now to my main dish, dessert! I was very happy with the rum cake (had to, it is Rumtoberfest after all), and there was a little happy dance with every bite! \n\nI would recommend Bahama Breeze for a gathering of any sort. They have a wide selection of flavorful food and their drinks do not disappoint!",

  "text": "My wife and I stopped in here for lunch today, as we were spending the day downtown shopping and just hanging out.  I love the charm of the old-city industrial architecture, and the roll-open doors make the open air dining really pleasurable, especially if you don't want to sit in the sun outside.  As far as the food goes, I'm kind of on the fence.  I got their signature burger and fries, and it was just ok.  I prefer thinner burgers, rather than one that gets built up like a tower, and is hard to take a bite out of.  10 Barrel's burger was definitely of the tower variety.  The rationalization for the four-star-review was my wife's sandwich.  She ordered the Americano Sano, which was absolutely delicious.  She loved it, and the bite she shared with me was really really good!  The servers were friendly, but I wished they made the rounds a bit more often.  I was really wanting a water refill, and couldn't find someone to ask.  So this place would have likely been a typical 3-star brewspot with average pub food, but I'll give them the nod since my wife's sandwich was soooo good!  We'll probably come back, but I will definitely be trying other items on the menu.\n\n[  They say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.  I've been quoting that cliché for years, and it has never convinced anyone to change their mind.  ]",

  "text": "Tampa, FL: Last night I enjoyed a good meal at Ulele. Was it the best meal I've ever had? No. Did I enjoy the meal? Yes. Will I recommend the place? Probably.\n\nWe called to make a reservation for two yesterday. We were told we didn't need reservations but if we wanted to make a reservation, the only openings were at 7:00 pm and 8:45 pm. We took the 8:45 pm. We ended up finishing our tasks early and got to the restaurant at 7:45 pm. We were chastised - not joking - by the guy at the front, who told us we had arrived too early. We told him we understood and after calming down, the employee told us we could sit at the bar and sit get served food.\n\nAfter a rude introduction, I enjoyed sitting at the bar. Our bartender/server, unlike the man at the front, was very sweet and extremely attentive - my water glass was never empty the entire meal. Though I didn't drink last night, I also enjoyed the look and energy of the bar, including the unique cocktails the bartenders concocted.\n\nI ordered the Florida Pompano, complete with a creamy tomato sauce, fried carrot ribbons, mashed potatoes, and green beans. As an occasional pescatarian, eating meat is quite heavy on my stomach. That didn't stop me from scarfing down half of the pompano filet last night - the sauce was INCREDIBLE and everything, even the carrot ribbons, worked well together. Though I'd prefer a better presentation - having the carrots piled on one side of the plate wasn't particularly appealing visually - I didn't have any complaints about the taste and creativity of the entree.\n\nI ended the meal with a slice of guava pie. The presentation was lovely, and the taste decent. I didn't mind the dessert ultimately, but I'm not going to be clambering to find another slice.\n\nUltimately, I liked this place. While I didn't care for the look of the place - it was a bit busy - the location off the park was unique and lovely. I didn't appreciate the employee at the front, and I think the price was a bit high for what I got. The creativity was refreshing though and I wouldn't hesitate to send people to Ulele. It's a \"must try\" restaurant at least once.",

A miracle worker. She took my long, thick, super straight hair, and cut and layered it to curl! Then after doing an outstanding job at cutting it, we discussed a highlight. She was excited because my hair was ...Virgin Hair lol! She found out there was no and hadn't been any color on my hair in many years. At least 4 or 5 I believe. An appointment was made and I couldn't wait!\nToday I went in early, and gave my hair over once again to the master. \nWhat I like about Intrinsic the most, is that it feels like you're sitting at home talking to family while you're getting pampered...and I need that. This salon is 'the salon'... ya know, the one you see in movies where everyone knows each other and talks about their lives, their days. This is the perfect therapy session. \nAfter highlighting my hair, she styled it and my jaw dropped! I LOVE it!!!! She hand painted highlights into my hair, held in place with foil and brought it to the most beautiful color.

I got the surfer girl omelette. Super bomb. They also give you a homemade muffin with it too. It is a little dry but definitely crunchy. \n\nService is awesome. Our server Steve is super warm and gives great suggestion for what to get. \n\nThey even have free WiFi. Overall great experience.",

  "text": "I have never eaten korean cuisine before, but had always wanted to try it.  Living just down the road from this new place, I was excited to try it out.  I went with a group of six people and upon arrival were the only larger table there.  We were there for 2 hours and as the night went on, two other larger tables arrived.  The three sisters who own the restaurant are the only 3 servers, so as they got busier, our service slowed way down.  It was difficult to flag someone down.  \n\nThe food however was delicious.  I loved getting all the different sides to try.  Everyone had a different favorite!  Be aware that they are sparing with refills.  You can only get one refill of rice and one refill on the sides without charge.  Also, they have alcohol listed on their menu, but they do not currently have a liquor license so you cannot order any right now.",

  "text": "This is not my first go round here and I haven't been disappointed yet. Not that I'm looking to. \n\nAlways come in groups so that you can try each other's side dishes without having to order them all yourself :) With that being said, download the NoWait app and place yourself in line as you are looking for a parking spot because I've never seen this place empty and the wait can get long because everyone loves it here. Service is A1 and you are constantly being checked on.\n\nTypically I'll order 1/4 chicken with mac & cheese and spoon bread. This go round I decided to share a 1/2 chicken with the same sides and another set of friends got the collards and mac& cheese. The collards came out in this smaller than normal container that did not look possible for 2 people to share let alone 4 people to try. Not sure how new that is.  Our table of 4 got 2 pitchers of Bourbon punch and boy were they both strong!\n\nTip 1: ask for bacon for the mac & cheese, you're welcome.\nTip 2: pour the spicy honey sauce on the chicken & spoon bread.\nTip 3: What are you waiting on? GO!",

  "text": "We went for lunch on a Tuesday and were pretty much the only customers. Which is a shame because Tamarind is spacious and distanced, very clean, and tastefully decorated. Everything is in new condition, including the stylish bar and comfortable patio with outdoor fireplace. \n\nA lunch menu would be a nice alternative to the lunch buffet, which is currently closed to minimize COVID risk. \n\nWe ordered chicken Hyderbadi 65 ($15), which is an appetizer-sized portion of marinated tandoor chicken garnished with red onion, cilantro and curry leaves. The chicken itself was a little on the dry side. But the marinade was very flavorful with a nice slow, medium heat (as requested). And the curry leaves imparted a nice balance overall. The portion size is small relative to the price. So I probably would try something else on the appetizer list next-time. \n\nLamb Masala ($15). *Delicious.* The lamb was tender but not mushy, very well seasoned, and didn't disappear into the gravy like many lesser quality places. The gravy was layered with hints of turmeric, cardamom, coriander, cumin and clove. Not a lot of heat. But wonderful in balance. \n\nGarlic Naan ($3.5). Very good texture, with a bit of crisp on the bottom and a nice hint of garlic. Not overly buttered or greasy. Delicious. \n\nOverall, Tamarind is wonderful. It's priced a little higher than some other places. But with the clean and stylish decor, and the wonderfully prepared food, it's definitely worth it. \n\nPlease give it a try.",

  "text": "Ok, so it's been 2 years since my children and I went to the Arch and I have had another kid since then too. Hear me out though. I wasn't on Yelp :) My dad and I took my 3 kids to St Louis in the summer of 2015. It was my kids first vacation. We stayed in a hotel downtown, about a 10 min walk from the arch. First of all...we were there during the Little People Convention, so it was much busier than usual. We were also there with they were doing some major construction on the area, but that didn't take away from the arch whatsoever. \n\nI believe it was $10 bucks a person when we went, which was well worth it. I am terrified of enclosed spaces and heights, so going up this thing was definitely for my kids at first and NOT me. \n\nWe got there super early and didn't wait long at all to get into a pod. The 5 of us (my dad, me and 3 kids) all fit into the pod comfortably. I was happy there was a window to look out as we went up vertically then sideways almost like a Ferris wheel once we got to the curve of the arch. Truthfully, it was terrifying for me lol but my kids loved it!!!!! As you go up, you can see all the pulleys and gears buried deep within the arch. If I hadn't been so scared, I would have enjoyed looking at that along the way up much more. \n\nOnce we got up, i felt like I was walking into a blast from the past with all the carpeted walls. The windows were pretty small, but still offered amazing views. If someone tells you the arch sways in the breeze - they are not joking. It wasn't terribly windy out, but it still moved some. Terrifying for this girl. Kids loved it. It was pretty small up top honestly, but still plenty of room to look out the windows and get some great photos!!!!",

  "text": "Awesome little hole in the wall, if that's what you can call it. It was hidden in a shopping center, but it was nice and clean inside. I knew it would be authentic since most people inside the restaurant were Bosnian I'm assuming. \n\nIf you are looking for something unique, fresh, delicious, with great service, look no further. I ordered the sausage sandwich. They had a large portion size and small portion size option, so I ordered the small portion size. Ordered some fries on the side, and was brought out an entire basket of fries!\nMedina, our adorable and helpful server, asked what sauce I wanted, and since I'm from Utah, I naturally asked for fry sauce and she was kind enough to mix me up some! The fries were perfectly cooked. No complaints whatsoever.\n\nMy sausage sandwich had a white and red sauce and they did not skimp on the sausages inside either. I will note that if you don't love uncooked onions, this may not be the dish for you. \nThis was unlike anything I've ever really eaten before, so nothing to compare it to but was very delicious.\nMy eating partner ordered the lamb gyro which should she said was also very delicious. \n\nIf you have little children, they have a kids menu option with a burger option, Nutella sandwic onh, and something else I can't remember what. But it is a place that will accommodate whatever kind of eaters you have in your party. \n\nWe paid $10 for each of our meals, which included fries and my drink, so that is very reasonable. I would say they could charge more and I would have not complained for how much food we received. \n\nIf I ever find myself back in this area, I will definitely stop by again!",

  "text": "I was less than happy with this place in the past. It was a bit shabby and slow even producing the most basic menu items. During the bulk of covid they wouldn't let people, even gloved and masked, walk into the lobby requiring you to use the drive through and the drive through was SLOW. Too damn slow to bother with. Something BK has admitted at a corporate level as an overall issue.\n\nI was pretty much resolved 'that's it never again.' Then this weekend they announce it was the anniversary of the Whopper and they would be selling at $0.37, their original price, all weekend.\n\nOK, I thought, the corporation knows they are losing market share and they're willing to make this really great offer.  The world is clawing its way out of the shut down, I'm willing to give them a chance. Maybe it has improved.\n\nuh-no. in fact it's worse. Remember BK was advertising $0.37/whopper all weekend. This was just before noon on a Saturday and they were charging full price. when i asked about it the kid behind the counter mumbled something about 'it's not working' and would only repeat that.\n\n\"What\" wasn't working? The cash register? nope they took the money. When i challenged him that it was supposed to run all weekend and they couldn't even make it to noon on a Saturday?  \"It's not working\" and not even a 'sorry.' \n\nSo the place is still shabby, and slow and NOW they are clearly not willing to honor the deals put out by the chain and lack even the common curtesy to say 'sorry.' I tried to report the incident on Burger King's site but they were having error's with their complaints board. Guess they don't care either. \n\nBK as a business is losing market share badly and not only is it no longer challenging McDonald's, they've fallen behind Wendy's. There's a Wendy's right across the street where the staff is perfectly friendly. Let this BK join the rest of its chain and sink out of sight.",

When my House Margarita arrived in blended form instead of \"over the rocks\", the serving staff apologized, removed the erroneous drink, and promptly returned with my proper order, a simple but well composed drink where I could taste the tequila not in slushy form. Complimentary, house made chips, light and crispy, and salsa with a bit of kick, made for a great  start to our meal.\n\nFOOD\nGreen Chili Pork Burrito w/rice & beans\nShredded Chicken Taco w/ rice & beans\nOff menu Chorizo con Huevo \nShredded Beef Chimichanga w/rice & beans\n\nI was surprised at seeing just a 3.5 star rating. This was our friends' favorite Mexican restaurant. We had to agree it was good. The rice was savory and moist. The refried beans were creamy and topped with melted cheese. Hubby thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast for dinner, his chorizo con huevo (sausage with eggs). My chimichanga shell was crispy and the generous shredded beef filling very tender and flavorful. Both our friends' taco and burrito did not disappoint. Our server stopped by at least three times after our food arrived to see how we were doing, and even brought out a second bowl of chips. The water glasses and iced tea were continually refilled.There is a bar and Happy Hour (2-5pm every day) is also served in the dining room. Two separate non-gender specific restrooms. Excellent service, delicious food, located in a strip mall with a small lot, accessed from southbound Houghton, south of Rita. Would love to come back to try more of their menu.",

They have everything from donut holes to bear claws to donuts bigger than your face. There were some cute Halloween ones with spider webs, skulls, and bats there this season. My favorite, of course, is the maple bar. You can order fresh coffee to sip with your donut, and eat at a table or take it to go. They have a super convenient drive thru, but I enjoy the experience of going in and looking at the variety they have available. This Doughboy is in a prime location by the super Walmart, so they get pretty busy on the weekend. The staff is super friendly and quick. The price is great. They sell donuts individually or whatever quantities you would like. Thumbs up from me.",

We did try to call ahead to find out a wait time, but they don't do call ahead seating and it's first come first serve according to the lady I spoke to on the phone. Like I said, we had no issues getting seated as a table of two with a great view of the beach, but it's something to keep in mind for larger parties or wanting preferred seating.\n\nMy boyfriend and I split an order of chips and queso with an side of salsa too, and he got the blackened chicken sandwich while I got the peel & eat shrimp (an appetizer) for my entree. The queso was advertised as spicy, but it really wasn't; the salsa actually had more of a kick to it than the queso. He loved his blackened chicken, but they do season it with some spices that might burn a bit. He poured some of the leftover queso on the chicken sandwich though & absolutely loved it! I had the peel & eat shrimp which was quite filling despite being an appetizer. \n\nWe finished up just before the sun started to set, so we used the convenient beachside location to go walk the sand & enjoy the sunset. As we were leaving the restaurant, we saw people setting up for live music so we were sad to miss that, but excited to catch it next time since we'll definitely be back!",

  "text": "We came here on a recent visit to Nola, we came upon it wandering around after riding the streetcar. And what a gem we found! This is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at in Nola. I did not realize at the time but it's listed as one of the top 50 restaurants in America. I can see why. The outside of the restaurant is what caught our attention. Tables outside, beautiful top balcony with very nice plants. We were seated at a cozy table inside and were immediately greeted by our phenomenal server Rene. Impeccable service from start to finish. He helped us pick out a great bottle of wine from their very extensive wine menu, which was at least 7 pages! We were overwhelmed by all the choices. We enjoyed a bottle of Bordeaux called    Diem. They have wines from all over the world here. I never seen a wine list quite like this one. The menu is just as amazing. Unique selections. For starters we shared a seasonal green salad that had feta, cucumbers, croutons and the most delicious buttermilk scallion dressing. Excellent! We loved the flavor combinations. We also shared a small plate of the beef short rib. Fall off the bone tender, with a wonderful salsa verde and horseradish cream sauce. For the main entrees we ordered the crispy goat which came with curried cauliflower, black beans and yogurt. It was presented in a large bowl. It was delicious! Similar to a curry but had large tender pieces of goat. Wonderful flavors and the perfect blend of spices. Incredible choice. My entree was a grilled Zabuton steak with French fries. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare. Beautifully marbled cut of meat. Tender and perfect. The fries were served with a nice sauce as well. We loved this place so much. We passed on dessert because we were so full. The ambiance, food, and service were simply phenomenal. The prices are very fair and not overpriced. Highly recommend eating here.",

We live in the city and therefore go pretty far out of our way to shop here. We typically go at the beginning of every week, either Monday or Tuesday, and it's never busy! Better yet, they are open 7 days a week and all year round. I imagine it's a little more crowded on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nTheir produce is local whenever possible. So, when you buy here, you're supporting big and small local farms... who wouldn't want to be a part of that? They are across the street from Webster University, so they provide affordable and healthy options for students, staff, and visitors. \n\nNot only do they have fresh produce, but depending on the season, they have different plants, flowers, and herbs. During the holiday season they have live trees you can take home to adorn your living room!\n\nOn top of all of these offerings and availability, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They always know where their food comes from and are readily willing to share that information. Rogers has been open for 40 years and counting. They have the perfect thing going to keep their regulars and grow their business.",

It's located in a building containing 5-6 other restaurants. Parking can be a headache since its so close to downtown and often these spots are blocked off for those who are going downtown to park all day. This parking headache tends to make me avoid eating there and just ordering for pickup. Check it out!",

My fave is the fuji apple chicken salad, minus the chicken - YUM! I also like the mac n' cheese. I wish they had another veggie sandwich here, because I don't care for the one they have. They used to have one I liked, but now they don't. It's ok though because I love their salads and they are healthier.\n\nAnd can I say BAGELS? I love their asiago, toasted with cream cheese. YUM! \n\nTheir drinks are good as well - I like the mochas (and I'm not a coffee drinker), chai, and smoothies.\n\nI love their rewards program - it's fun getting random rewards and being able to cash them in. I wish they had different rewards more. I've only gotten bagels, baked goods and drinks (no sandwiches, etc)\n\nThe downside is that parking is a small alley way or the street - don't even think about parking in Straub's lot unless you go in there to buy something (which I sometimes do if I don't feel like parallel parking!). They will cut you if you do! No really, once I got a note on my car when I parked around the side when I didn't go in. So just don't do it.",

The display of coffee-related items is intriguing; makes me wish I could afford to be fancy.  \n\nTheir pastry selection is small, but again, it's a coffee shop, not a restaurant.  I'll probably be back because it's near Barnes and Noble and I can just picture myself reading a recently purchased book here while I sip some mildly expensive coffee.",

Great service and he gave the best recommendations!\n\nSeafood tower: phenomenal seafood and very fresh variety - lobster, crab salad, oysters, poke \n\nLow country bbq shrimp: shrimp with toasted focaccia dipped in a creamy sauce. This was my favorite dish. The sauce was so flavorful and went so well with the shrimp and bread. \n\nCatch of the day: sea bass was cooked well with the pork belly and fingerling potatoes and the sauce was very flavorful \n\n\nButtermilk cake: one of the highlight of the evening - butter milk cake with fig, mascarpone, earl grey fluff. Light and not too sweet. Great end to the night. \n\nDrinks were phenomenal - flavorful Craft cocktails. \nFlying High: my favorite. This is for the gin lovers. It's a nice purple color and light, kind of a floral lavender taste. \nViper : very refreshing, strong cucumber taste with a hint of chili sprinkled on top but not too overbearing\nMoment of clarity: great tequila /peach drink with a hint of eucalyptus.",

They were super tasty and the perfect pairing with a few beers! \n\nI loved how the toppings were unlimited (with the exception of guacamole which is only $1 extra), so we loaded it up with everything. The chips were crispy and salty and the beef was so tender. For $8 the bowl of nachos was HUGE and more than enough for my husband and I to share. Nothing got soggy, but maybe that's because we scarfed it down in 5 seconds flat because it tasted so good! \n\nSome of the best nachos I've had in a while, and next time I'd love to try one of the tacos or rice bowls.",

Not saying the food is bad I'm just saying for the money you can get much better food, atmosphere they have in spades but I feel like I've had most of the dishes they offer here over at Flamestone in Oldsmar. Not really a surprise since Chief Eric was the executive chef over there as well but seems a large step up in price point for the \"same food\". Now if you want a nice place to Wow visitors from out of town this would be a great place to start but again IMO the atmosphere and location will wow them more than the food. Oh and they brew their own beer, nothing I had on the beer menu really excited me. I think its great that they are trying but there's just so much better beer in Tampa.",

We were seated immediately, so I had time to see the old school charm of this place in all its fake bunch of grape glory. But one cannot judge a restaurant on its decorations alone!  \n\nI couldn't decide on what to order, so I opted for the combination meatballs and ravioli with spaghetti ($15). The marinara sauce was thick and salty and just a bit tart and oh so good.  This is not your off the shelf jarred sweet Ragu sauce. I didn't think I could finish it, but I did (sadly) and NO REGRETS.\n\nWe enjoyed people watching the bar (lots of regulars, it seems) and the mix of friends and family gathering. But the cutest thing was seeing a high school couple have dinner in all their prom finery, holding hands and being all lovey dovey.  Oh, young love!

  "text": "You all know Rosa J. loves her coffee.  The Nashville musician cousin recommended \"Crema,\" out of many local coffee destinations.  \n\n\"Crema\" is located near the Ascend Amphitheater, where the Tennessee Titans play.  When our group arrived at the Sunday morning at around 10am, this place was PACKED.  \"Crema\" has its own parking lot, beautifully-decorated outdoor patio, and comfortable indoor seating.  I was truly impressed by this wonderful piece of real estate and definitely looking forward to trying the coffee made by their in-house roasted beans.  \n\nSince hubby and I were planning on getting back to Chicago as early as we could, we had our drinks to-go.  The staff seemed to know how to deal with the crowd; the team worked quite efficiently together.  One of the baristas was exclusively responsible for making the pour-over, while others shared other tasks to ensure all the orders were fulfilled in a timely fashion.  \n\nBy the way, they have an extensive pour-over menu.  Unfortunately I didn't think I had much time to wait for the coffee (10-15 min).  \n\nI, therefore, opted for the iced Cuban, latte with sweetened condensed milk.  Unless you absolutely reject anything sweetened in a beverage, give this one a try because the sweetness was very subtle and sophisticated.  \n\nHubby, on the other hand, had the \"coffee soda.\"  It essentially is carbonated coffee, mixed with Demerara sugar, and topped with orange peel.  I wouldn't say it was particularly tasty; it was rather interesting since it had an unexplainable \"bitterness\" when I had the first sip.  It was similar to drinking iced black coffee with a \"punch.\"  \n\nI could easily see why \"Crema\" is a popular hangout joint for the locals and visitors.  I also gave this place a high praise and hopefully will make it back at some point.",

  "text": "My great friend Jonny recently told me that Monk's was recently rated the #3 bar in the country by Beer Advocate magazine. Having a bar THAT good in my city, is phenomenal. On top of that, the prices are such that Monk's is accessible to most people who are going out to eat. Monk's really is an excellent bar, so it's hard to find much wrong with it.\n\nI must start with the beer. When I visited on 3/20, the tap list was pretty disappointing. There wasn't anything that was interesting that I had not already tried. I was with my good friend Quinn, and our server didn't tell us anything about the tap list at the back bar. The bottle list is quite extensive, so much so that I was a bit overwhelmed by it. Our server, Maggie, actually did a great job helping me find a beer that I wanted to try without seeming impatient or condescending. When people know a lot about beer, they sometimes seem to operate with an informational advantage. Monk's beer might seem expensive, but for what you are getting, everything is reasonable.\n\nI'm not great at describing beers, but here's a short list. The beers I had were:\n1) Aventinus wheat doppelbock - I have never had this, and I know it's a pretty standard and widely enjoyed beer. it was a bit malty, but still easy drinking. It went well with my food.\n2) Jolly Pumpkin Bam Beir - A light and slightly sour saison. It was really different than I was expecting from a saison. Decnet, but I wouldn't have it again.\n3) Chimay Grand Reserve - Finished the night with a classic beer.\n\nAs expected, the fries at Monk's are bangin' (mussels and fries are Belgium's national dish). I continued my search for the most delicious burger in Philadelphia by ordering the Antwerp burger, beef with truffle cheese and shitaki mushrooms. While being an excellent burger, it's not the best in the city (but is not too far off either), nor the best item on the menu. If you like cultural dining, or seafood, the mussels are the way to go. I've had them before, and with the right sauce, you have a near perfect meal.\n\nMonk's does not accept reservations and get extremely crowded. Quinn and I didn't have to wait for a table, but after we finished our food there was an hour wait. We sat at our table for almost an hour just drinking and didn't recieve any pressure to hurry up or move to the bar. I love that. The atmosphere at Monk's cosy and inviting, especially in the front room.  Lastly, the music selection was awesome all night.  I was jamming.\n\nOverall, Monk's is great. It might not be my favorite bar ever, but I'm glad to have it in my city. Each day I realize a little bit more how beer-rich Philadelphia is.",

I have been to Akers for strawberry picking blackberry picking, peach picking, apple picking, and pumpkin picking. I love the family atmosphere of Eckerts because there is so much to do when you visit the main location in Belleville. The remodel that they have done over the last decade is phenomenal and it truly is a destination place! When you visit you not only have to do pick your own picking and take a ride on the tractor pool wagons but you also need to visit the country store, A well-stocked grocery store with a full bakery a great deli counter, wines and ciders, jams, jellies, salsas, and chowchow, and of course all of the fresh produce that Eckert's has to offer.\nThey also have great country inspired gifts and souvenirs and they also have a garden area as well. Within the country store area they also have a full demo kitchen for demonstration and cooking classes although I don't think they are doing too much of that during the pandemic. You also have to visit the restaurant which is a local version of aCracker Barrel. They have a great static menu as well as rotating seasonal drinks and food specials throughout the year. I love the fried biscuits and apple butter they serve at the table with every meal, and make sure you try their seasonal sweet teas and lemonades. During the peak of their picking seasons they usually have family friendly events on the weekends for kids like carnival rides petting zoo etc. In the summer and early fall they also have their custard shop open, so you can enjoy a scoop of house churned custard while enjoying the views.",

  "text": "A group of 6 of us went here for the Champagne brunch prior to boating. The brunch was $17.95/pp and included 2 mimosas and coffee or tea. There was a decent spread of options for brunch. I had the eggs benedict which was okay, but not great, due to the fact that it had been sitting under the warmer for a while. I also had grilled potatoes that were good, waffle and seafood mac & cheese - just okay, but another member of my party loved it. Others had the omelets made fresh, biscuits and gravy and the smoked salmon. Was told it was the best smoked salmon ever. They had a small dessert bar with a chocolate fountain that you could dip strawberries, marshmallows or rice krispie treats in.  Even though our server didn't have to bring us food, I felt he was a bit slow at clearing away our dirty plates.  Overall pretty good and a nice little place for decent brunch if you're in Ruskin but I wouldn't drive back over from St. Pete just for brunch.",

  "text": "My sister and I wandered over to Falls Taproom for an after dinner drink on Friday night. The downstairs bar was packed but we grabbed two newly opened seats at the bar upstairs. I love the dark wood and old timey light bulbs. Didn't really love/understand the TVs with black and white movies, which were on silent. I say sports or nothing! \n\nThe cocktail menu is interesting and I was immediately drawn to the hot apple cider with rum. My sister opted for another boozy concoction but she switched over to the apple cider for her second round. I loved the cracked clove on top; it made the drink very fragrant. This is the perfect beverage for a chilly fall night. \n\nOur bartender was nice and we enjoyed chatting with him. We're already talking about our next visit!",

  "text": "First time at PDQ... was hoping for a bit more. Ordered a Classic Crispy Salad with Bleu Cheese dressing, and a order of tenders since I wanted to try them. Asked for two sauces, the creamy garlic and the buffalo bleu.\n\nWhat I got was the salad as ordered, the tenders, and three tubs of Bleu Cheese dressing. No big deal.. I like bleu cheese dressing. And yes... I could have gotten up and wandered over to the counter, and asked for the other sauces... and I am sure they would have been happy to give me some. But I didn't...\n\nSalad was ok... crispy tenders in the salad were ok. Dressing was ok.  Tenders were ok. \n\nI would eat here again... although if a slightly less healthy fried chicken competitor was closer... I would probably eat there instead.\n\nOne thing I did love was the Cheerwine Cherry soda they have.. that was GOOD!\n\nStaff was friendly. Location was clean. A bit noisy, but that was the other diners... so not unexpected.\n\nOk... not spectacular... 3 stars",

  "text": "5 Stars for the Shrimp Pad Thai alone.  This is easily one of the best Pad Thai dishes I've had in AZ - the noodles are the perfect texture and sauced just right.  The tang of the sauce is excellent and they can adjust the heat levels for you.  There is a good amount of shrimp in the dish as well.  It is a massive portion - I cannot finish it and my husband ate some but there were still leftovers.\n\nAs the sister restaurant of my beloved Miss Saigon on Speedway, their pho is just as good.  This location offers a full bar, and they have a list of cocktails that are STRONG.  \n\nI recommend this location if you want a full sit down, date type of ambiance.  They have full booths you can sit at and it doesn't feel quite as rushed as the Speedway location (people in and out so quickly, take out, etc).  \n\nService is typical - not horribly attentive but you aren't left stranded looking to get your waters refilled.\n\nI always want to try more of their menu but get stuck on the pho and the pad thai.",

  "text": "So sorry, now at 3 stars!\nThis is my second experience where the service or lack thereof, ruined a lovely meal. I didn't review that other experience and think I should have. Our order on that visit was never put into the kitchen and so there we sat as all others around are promptly served with their meals. We were beyond patient and didn't want to be negative but it became absurd and then found out the waiter forgot our order????? This time, we were a party of three, it was about 1:30 pm, after enjoying a movie, we decided to walk across the street to Campo. There were two other people in the restaurant when we arrived. We ordered and waited. The meals were wonderful but the lack of service reached a new low. We are now the only people in the restaurant. We saw every chef as they walked past our table, lots of staff walked past our table but our waiter was pretty much gone. We needed to order our favorite Budino treat. A man, I assume was the manager on duty, came by, after seeing us peering out of our booth trying to get some help, we explained our waiter had not been seen in a long time and we wanted to order our Budino. He said not a problem, will take care of that for you. Perhaps a solid 15 mins later we are amazed, as no sign of the budino, no sign of the waiter. Now the budinos are premade so made no sense. Next our waiter does show up and asks if we would like a dessert. !!!!! We explained at this point we have waited 20 mins for a non appearing budino, so off he goes. Yes, he comes back with the treat, no apologies, just a big smile as if he has been amazing all this time. \nThis is the second time service has been a huge issue. for no good reason. I shall think twice before going here again. Love their food but negative experiences such as this have consequences. Yes, they did charge me the $8.00 for that long awaited budino.",

It was ridiculously amazing. As you're eating the stage in front of you backs up to full glass windows from the length of the floor to the ceiling and what is on the other side of the windows in clear view, the beautiful lit up batman building (ATT building).  It's gorgeous. Great cameo pics.  So let's discuss the food, it seemed to be all high ticket items, like steak and the normal nice steak house sides, potatoes, etc. Nothing tasted that great. It was really bland and it wasn't necessarily HOT coming to us straight out of the oven. I wasn't impressed.  The drinks, I stuck with wine and I feel like they tasted skimpy on the pour for the price and a touch watered-down. I know, how is that even possible?  I love that you can walk here while you're inside the OMNI hotel. Perfect!! The band that was playing was pretty good and they played a variety of music, which was another perk to the night.",

It was close to where we were staying and the reviews seemed to praise the food.\n\nI can't say I hated it but I can't say I loved it either. The crab/cheese dip was really good as our appetizer. My entree of catfish was really bad though. It was fried in a flour type batter and some may love it this way but I was looking for more of a crunch and a more corn meal crust. It also tasted VERY muddy. Just seemed like it wasn't clean..yuck. The bread pudding is good but really it just tasted like a cinnamon roll. We did have a good waiter so that was a plus but all in all I would have to say that I wouldn't go back. I was dieing for some crab legs and they didnt have any =( Oh well, live and learn.",

  "text": "First Review of the new year, this feels absolutely amazing. So here goes nothing. My MOTHER is in town everyone, my beautiful goddess of a vegetarian (technically (pescatarian)mother is in town. This is an important intro because Novio wanted to eat some sushi and mom loves sushi so we went straight to Sushi Maru.\n\nQuick Pause, guys when you roll into this lil mini mall the sushi place looks like a laundromat from the outside so if you think you're going to a dingy lil asian place you are in the right spot. I was arguing from the moment Novio parked the car till we opened the restaurant door. Boy was I wrong about this place. The decoration is extremely chic and they treat you with a significant amount of respect. \n\nWe were seated at a comfortable corner booth in front of the bar. Our server Kyler, gave us such great recommendations of food, but Novio and I could not keep our eyes off our neighboors plates. We were so ecstatic to find out they had a KOREAN SECTION. Additionally they have a weekday sushi happy hour from 5pm to 8pm ( the listed rolls are $10) and its a very inclusive list. \n\nMom and fer ordered the st Patrick's roll and usf roll (in accordance to Kyle's recommendation). Fer and I then ordered the bimbimbap. Oh my gosh how delicious was everything that they gave us. The bimbimbap was enormous (there is a picture attacbed of this meal). We took enough food home for lunch and dinner. Oh and they have a button to call the server, don't do it cause I think it may give them an electric shock, which is probably why sevrice is so quick. \n\nThings to take away from this review: delicious KOREAN section, weekday sushi happy hower ($10 a roll), they shock their staff with electric buttons so service is really quick (I'm kidding they probably don't harm their staff) and they have a 2 for one happy hour with really cheap drink a as well.",

For instance, I wasn't crazy about their brunch menu on our midday Saturday visit, or their version of a Cuban sandwich, or the flavor of their french fries (probably my least favorite thing on the menu), but on their lunch menu,  I absolutely love their flat breads (every one I've tried...try the flatbread!!!), their OMG burger (it was tall, juicy, and very tasty) their fried green tomatoes, and the oysters Rockefeller. You can't go wrong with any of these...\n\nThis place boasts itself as farm to table eatery serving seasonal fresh, local ingredients in and a very cozy and comfortable atmosphere/environment.They have a wall of various lettuces/greens growing in the middle of the restaurant, and fresh herbs for center pieces on each table. I'd love to duplicate this in my kitchen at home!!\n\nI have only been here for lunch so far, on three separate occasions, and each time I was greeted by a wonderful aroma (oh yeas, and host), seated quickly (never very busy on my visits), and waited on by pleasant and knowledgeable staff. The parking lot adjacent the building is very small (3-4 spaces?), but there is additional parking on the next block. My best recommendation for lunch would be to try one of their affordable $9.00 combos (half a flatbread and a soup or a salad).",

They use a very cheap grade of meat and when they cook it, they chop it up so fine that it becomes pulverised till it's like the consistency of baby food. It's chopped and grilled to death! Pagno's gives you a lot of meat-which is what the budget-minded consumer loves, hence the reputation. But again it's a cheap grade of meat so I'm definitely not feeling it. Then they use a regular Amoroso roll! And any Philly sandwich aficionado will tell you that this roll will not stand up to a lot of cheap meat. The result is a sloppy, gooey, smelly hot mess.

They have a really nice selection of beers (but no PBR!) and food. The place is surprisingly big, with table seating towards the back. The bartenders were all really sweet and cute, too. Johnny Brenda's also has THE CLEANEST BAR BATHROOM I HAVE EVER PEED IN! So happy. Check out the jukebox, it will not disappoint. \n\nThe venue upstairs was the absolute best. It's very cozy and intimate. The stage is just big enough to fit a 4 piece band and only stands about 3 feet high. There's another small bar upstairs with some very heavy handed bartenders so beware.

I went to bed that night without horrible ringing in my ears.\nI usually avoid R5 shows nowadays since the average age of the crowd is 16, but this place has rekindled my love for live music.\nAwesome place that lacks the douche-baggery that some other bars carry.\n(But let's keep it that way, ok?)",

When I moved to Brownsburg, I was still taking him to the bowling alley we were used to on the West side of Indianapolis.  When my husband told me to save some driving time and check out the bowling alley in town, I was skeptical.  \n\nIt wasn't until we'd gone bowling two weekend nights with great success that we noticed the Monday bowling special.  Now, along with the occasional weekend night, we bowl almost every Monday.  \n\nThey have been very accommodating where my son's special needs are concerned and that means the world to this Mama.  When we bring our toddler grandson along, they accept our little corner of controlled chaos, always giving us a little space between our lane and the next one being used.  I'm sure the other patrons appreciate that as well.  But, if you need a non-crowded atmosphere, Monday is the day to go.  The two hour bowling special paired with a pizza and drink special is perfect for the budget conscientious.  We've tried a few other menu selections (I love the Chicken Tenders), but we always get a pizza while we're there. \n\nAs I mentioned, the staff has been very accommodating and helpful where my son is concerned.  It took them a minute to appreciate him and heed our small requests, but now I would absolutely recommend Brownsburg Bowl to fellow parents of children with special needs.  \n\nAlthough the tiny toddler size 7 bowling shoes make my heart swell from the cuteness, the adult shoes are a bit worn, uncomfortable and sometimes painful.  But, they do seem to have a huge selection of bowling balls in many different sizes. \n\nThe weekend cosmic bowling is more expensive and more crowded, but a very good time with strobe lights and fun music.  \n\nBottom line, Brownsburg Bowl is a great place to spend time and have fun whether alone, with friends or with family.   Enjoy!",

  "text": "Green Goddess is a teensy bit hard to find, as it's tucked away in a quiet alley in the French Quarter that feels very removed from the carousing crowds. There's limited indoor seating and some outdoor tables, and the space is friendly with a hippie vibe --  this restaurant is imbued with lots of love and care, and the staff are all incredibly friendly and sweet.\n\nI came here on a Sunday evening for a cleansing experience after a weekend of gluttonous meat eating, and Green Goddess gave me exactly what I needed. It's not fancy or pretentious food, and everything, I would say, has a pretty earthy vibe. Also, note to all you hardcore vegans out there, there is plenty of meat on this menu.\n\nI got the beet hummus, the mushroom pate, and the freekeh salad. The first two came with a nice selection of crudites and crispy bread rounds, and the salad was nicely composed with greens, grains, and dressing. Everything had pretty good flavor and great texture, though I wouldn't necessarily say that it was super rich with flavor dimension, and I left feeling full and satisfied with just those three small plates. This is a great option if you have special dietary needs or if you just need a break from the heavier regional food styles around here.",

  "text": "What a great experience at this lovely Italian restaurant in Santa Barbara. It's a smaller quaint place with about a dozen or so tables. They have a wonderful wine selection of Italian and California wines. \n\nThe menu is quite extensive with many specials offered and fresh fish and homemade pasta to choose from. They had a variety of antipasta and salad options, appetizers and main courses. The portions are fairly large and you can ask to split any meal also. \n\nOur server, Estaban, was very nice and pleasant and was very patient with us as we were taking some time to select our wine and food. We needed up opening up 3 bottles of wine before finding the one we liked and did split an entre- the ink squid risotto- which was amazingly delicious. \n\nI had the salmon special and couldn't finish it because it was a large portion, with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My husband had the veal scaloppini, which he enjoyed very much. We didn't have room for dessert, but saw a few go by our table and they looked delicious. \n\nFrom one Sicilian to another, it was a true authentic Italian restaurant - and we'll be back!  Thank you for an amazing experience!!",

My friend and I ordered the Mapo Tofu, chicken gizzards with pickled pepper and brown sugar jelly. The mapo tofu and chicken gizzards definitely had an authentic taste and I loved how it was actually spicy compared to other restaurants that sell the dish. Only con to this place is that the water tastes absolutely disgusting! I don't know if it's because it was sitting in a pitcher all day, but I noticed that it had weird flakes in the glass and tasted worse than tap water. Other than that, the food was pretty good. Definitely recommend the chicken gizzards with picked pepper!",

  "text": "Came here on a nice Sunday morning. Parked across street easily in a loading zone. Ordered two breakfast sammies and 2 rainbow bagels to go for the week. As well as a matcha latte. I won't say it was cheap but it was what you'd expect. It all cost about $30. The matcha latte was a treat, perfectly sweet and very very good and had oat milk. Loved it (I make my own at home but this was a special treat for me to pair with my rainbow bagel). I got my sandwich on a rainbow bagel as wel and loved it. So glad there's a place in philly that's From NYC that serves rainbow bagels. Wooo!! We didn't think the bagels and sammies were 10/10 but they were definitely very good and exciting to get. I liked this place more for a plain bagel with cream cheese honestly. But the Sammy was also fine just perhaps not worth the $8 plus tax. I loved their variety of spreads available. I'll be back for more rainbow bagels - which the cafe is currently donating $1 each of sales to philly  ASIAN queer org. I'm an Asian woman and really really love this and am very impressed bc everyone seems to forget that we are also people of color and a minority who deserve equality and respect. So that was also a plus. Thanks for the GREAT service and lovely food.",

For under $15, I could have a salad, bread, huge serving of pasta and a dessert to top it off. I recently learned that they don't take reservations, which could be a blessing or a curse. In my most recent case, a friend and I wanted to go to dinner on Valentine's Day and we knew - for a fact - that most restaurants would be packed. Thankfully we were able to get into the Spaghetti Factory immediately. We chose to sit in the bar area upstairs, which turned out to be equally as nice as the regular seating below. \n\nI actually told me family today that this would be a great place for us to go - considering we're a family of six and no matter what, going out to eat is pricey. This way, we can have a good meal downtown and not feel like we broke the bank. \n\nMy only downfall was the service. Everyone was super nice - so that's great. The issue was that they really didn't seem on top of their game. Some forgetfulness was observed, but hey - everyone's human. All in all, I really enjoy this place and let's be honest - who doesn't love pasta?",

I found the Columbia Restaurant in Ybor city and insisted that we go for dinner. \n\nI love to cook and eat Latin food, so I really looked forward to trying it their way. They have in fact been open since 1905, with the recipes influenced by Cuban, Spanish, European, etc. I loved the stories behind the dishes in the menu. \n\nThe Sangia is a must, the only question is which one to get. We went with the suggestion by our bartender and ordered the Red Sangria made from Imported wine, fruit and brandy. It's got a kick to it, but smooth enough to keep drinking. \n\nI was told by several people and saw in several reviews to try the 1905 salad. We ordered a side salad and split it. It was pretty big. The salad is pretty damn good and left us thinking why was it so damn good, was it the dressing or the olives, the cheese? I need the recipe. \n\nWe ordered a Cubano to split, which was HUGE. It was very good and served with plantain chips. The bread was sweet, yet toasted and it was very filling.\n\nWe also ordered the Gambas Al Ajo which were these huge shrimp sautéed in garlic and chiles and served in a clay dish. This was served with fresh hot Cuban bread and butter. \n\nAlthough we only ordered a small salad, one sandwich and a tapa plate, we were stuffed. I loved the restaurant, the food, the service and would most definitely come back. \n\nPlaces like this need to stay around, so that newer generations can appreciate the Original, Local and Authentic food and establishments  that built Ybor City and Tampa Bay.",

I appreciate a falafel place with few choices, and the sandwiches come fully loaded unless you say otherwise -- when I don't feel like doing my own toppings combo, this is perfect.\n\nAs you probably figured out, Goldie is from the same people as Zahav, with great falafel/everything as a result. When you're ordering, there are only a few choices (plus a couple on an \"off-menu\" board, for a change of pace) -- for falafel sandwich, you choose the flavor of falafel (plain, harissa, amba, or shug, I tend to get harissa because I forget what the others are). Fries are a cool $3 but super tasty ... you can probably share an order (small bag) with someone if you're like me, but I can also clear a bag myself pretty easily.\n\nTahini shakes are so great but I have to have room for it -- so rich! In general though, I love that they're on the limited menu, and I love that coming to Goldie is uncomplicated. There're places to sit down and eat in (with a pretty nice atmosphere for a sandwich shop), and in the warmer season, it's great to pick up and walk to Rittenhouse with your food.

The fried artichokes were abundant and the burrata was soft and delicious. For the entree we got the fish of the day which was sword fish and I got the braised beef short rib.

For dessert we got tiramisu and the flourless brownie. I loved the tiramisu, it was delicious and it came with a small biscotti with pistachios in it. The flourless brownie was more fudge like and if you like that kind of thing the  brownie was for you. Also it came with espresso gelato and it was very coffee tasting.

I have been a long and fiercely loyal member of that 'other' coffee spot...and I kept hearing about this place on Yelp, so I came by with my husband and not only did we LOVE our bagel breakfast sandwiches...more about those later...but, the iced coffee???? I thought I'd died and gone to Nicaraguan coffee bean field heaven. \n\nI started making up reasons to drive to that area, which, to be totally honest, I have ALWAYS avoided before because of the weird strip center in and out and the lack of parking. Well...let me tell you, I found a work around!  and it's a secret...so, SHHHH!!!! Go Kennedy to Lois, south one block to Cleveland and turn left, follow it ALMOST to the dreaded Dale Mabry but turn left on Roland and it's at the end of the road RIGHT BEFORE KENNEDY! There's a strip center on the right that has room to turn around and go back the same way, then you never have to deal with the Kennedy/Dale Mabry intersection! \n\nLike I said, it's a secret. Oh! And there's parking for Original Brooklyn Bagel back there, TOO!! \n\nNow...back to the coffee...yes, they have hot coffee, but the iced coffee is where it's at! They have COFFEE ICE CUBES!! Then, about 12 flavor pumps, then 3 types of iced coffee from flavored to medium to dark, THEN several flavors of cream!! Seriously. It's heaven. \n\nAnd the bagels are made as you watch. All different flavors and I'm typically an everything girl, but I've gotten hooked on-get this, Maple brown sugar!? Who'da thunk it?? \n\nThe sandwiches are huge and super yummy!!! Gotta go-but, leave the back parking for me!!",

  "text": "I love this little Metairie, Louisiana pizza joint.  \n\nI'm in town for a couple months on business, got some cold/stale Pizza Hut, some cold/stale Domino's, decided I'd branch out and gamble with a local spot, tried a few, nobody would deliver to me, found these people and haven't gone anywhere else since.  I've probably ordered from them a half-dozen times in three weeks.  \n\nThe pizza is good.  Like, really good in my opinion.  Damn tasty!  My girlfriend came to visit, we ordered it, and she loved it too.  I mean, we've had some of the best pizza in the country and I'm not saying it's on par with Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix or Giordano's or any of the other Chicago joints or anything like that but, for this area, yeah . . . solid pizza.\n\nAnd the delivery guy is FAST and very friendly.  Where Pizza Hut and Domino's took over an hour and brought me cold/stale pizza, this guy always brings it by super fast and the pizza is always hot.  \n\nOh, and they must appreciate the frequency in which I order because my last pizza came with some free cheesecake bites that were absolutely delicious.  (Or maybe there was a language barrier since they are Asian with thick accents and charged me for that dessert -- or maybe they just screwed up the order -- at any rate, I'm gonna assume it was a gift for being a repeat customer).  \n\nI dig this place.  A solid four stars from me but I'll bump it to a 5 on this review to help raise their score.",

The food was excellent - but to be quite honest, by the time we were seated, my palate was probably not as \"refined\".  I know I gobbled everything up.  The little round bread ball things are also very good.  \n\nService was good except they were over-attentive as in they kept trying to take my plate (politely, of course).  We were too stuffed for dessert  and I thanked my lucky stars for not tumbling, post-sangria, down the flight of stairs.",

I mean what other bar out there lets you pick up a happy meal that includes 2 hot dogs, a PBR pounder, and a toy for 5 bucks?\n\nThe PBR and shot specials flow endlessly throughout this chill spot that lies under the El. But they also have a rotating Beer of the Month specials and a variety of drinks that go well above the average dive. \n\nBut the best part of the El Bar is the eclectic offerings that you'll come across on any given night. Its small stage showcases plenty of random punk rock shows throughout the night. Foo Truck has started showing up on special nightly occasions giving you a chance to enjoy delicious yet healthy wraps and veggie offerings. With a table top Mrs. Pac Man, random arcade games, and ample -PINBALL ALERT- it provides some good drunken video game moments. And you'll find plenty of subtle perks like a decent happy hour, and a cool outdoor courtyard.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, El Bar is clearly a dive that gives you more to love!",

They have a pretty extensive menu, but Mother's for me is a po' boy spot. They are huge and fantastic. Their signature sandwiches are the ones with the \"debris\" which I think is that ity bity porky goodness. I can't remember which one, but the BF got one with ham, a couple other meats and the debris. It was lip smackin'! I almost always get a shrimp or oyster and shrimp po'boy, and this time was no exception. There's something about Mother's po'boy that just tastes better than any of the others I've had.  They have a host of sides, one of which is a boiled cabbage...it might not it sound it but I love it! I get it every time! \nThe set-up of the restaurant is interesting because you wait in line, place your food and drink order- kind of like at a hospital cafeteria- but then you go sit down and waitresses bring you your food and refill your drinks. Because of this, they have a no tipping policy, which lets you choose if you want to tip or not. It's really kind of weird, but it's not a high paying job, so...please tip:)!",

  "text": "I only been in here once, and this was my first time!  From what I can tell, the restaurant has got to be something good, the patrons did not mind waiting for minutes to get a seat, not one of them that came to the door said forget it.  They all said I will wait, at least from my observation.\n\nWe had a bit of a wait as they only have 6 tables, but they do have two bars one being very small.  It is a small dining room also, but it almost makes you think of home.  The prices are right, the food is good.  \n\nDon't be surprised if the people you sit next to decides to have a conversation with you.  There is a nice laid back older crowd that patronizes here, which is what I love!  The only thing about it is, they have limited space, so there is a need to get you serviced, fed and out the door as they have people waiting to come in.  If you could come in and eat and take your time socializing, you would never go home probably as you would want to stay and talk to all the interesting people.  I felt like you could get to know someone here, and make some friends.\n\nI ordered the Farmers omelet, it looked great, nice appeal.  In addition to that I swapped out the toast for the pancake, they give you 1 pancake instead of the toast if you want it swapped.  The pancake looked nice, good appeal lightly golden, it was one of those soft buttermilk type pancakes a bit doughy to me but thin and good, not great!  I had hash browns...oh boy did those hash brown ever have eye appeal,  they looked just like the one I would want my hash browns to look always.  The only problem is, no tabasco sauce...I cannot do hash browns right without tabasco sauce.  They have hot sauce but you know that has more of a sour taste than a spicy hot taste, not what I am looking for on my hash browns.  I also had a cup of coffee, well I drink Starbucks it was not as strong as theirs but tasted good.\n\nThe Farmers omelet had a fresh, clean delicious flavor to it.  You could actually enjoy the eggs and taste the different components of the omelet.  No one thing simply overwhelmed the other, they all married together to make it a delicious omelet almost made me think it was healthy.  It was not a greasy omelet like most diners may serve, this had some love on it.\n\nThe hash browns taste were the same way, clean, fresh, delicious not greasy or artery clogging.  They were quite good, but could have been awesome...lol...with tabasco sauce!\n\nThe coffee was good, however, it was weak but good.  I am saying that because I drink my coffee on the strong side, with cream and sugar.  If you like it black this may be perfect for you!  \n\nI enjoyed my breakfast overall and I plan to go back there for lunch and more.  This is a clean establishment and they take care of this place; it is small, however, that may be what makes it so special.",

We usually come here when the wait for Frenchy's is too long .No visit for my family and I is complete without their mouth watering fish spread. It's so good that since trying it so many years ago for the first time, every fish spread I've ever had since then as been compared to Frenchy's. They have a full menu complete with chicken dishes and burgers for the non-seafood lovers but the seafood is really where it's at. My personal favorite is their original grouper sandwich, I can't even begin to describe how delicious it is. They also have daily specials on weekdays. Drinks here are really reasonable and made really well.  No trip to Clearwater Beach is complete without a visit to Frenchy's or one of their  other three restaurants on Clearwater Beach. Dont miss it, believe me, you'll thank me!",

  "text": "Today, I went to Love & Honey around 2:00pm. When we got there, all but 4 of the seats were taken, but everyone was eating. I ordered the chicken tenders with buttermilk ranch. My boyfriend ordered the half chicken with potato salad, as well as a slice of the lemon cream pie. After I sat down, I found out he also ordered the OG chicken sandwich to try. While we waited for our food, everyone else cleared out. Two women were leaving and asked if we wanted their side of pickles because they didn't eat them. We gladly took them, and tried those as well. The pickles were delicious! Sweet and sour at the same time.\n\nOur food came out after about 10 minutes, and everything smelled delicious. The chicken was drizzled with honey, which I didn't realize would happen. The taste was amazing. Also, the buttermilk rank was so good. I ended up buying a side of the honey mustard as well, which is a little more mustardy than I prefer, but it was also yummy. We tried the OG sandwich, and it had a spicy slaw, which I wasn't expecting. I preferred the chicken tenders to the sandwich, but I think that's because the chicken is so good on its own! The potato salad was also delicious. It has a pickle relish in it, and it doesn't have onions (that we could taste), which was perfect for my boyfriend who doesn't like onions. The woman taking our order let us try to potato salad before ordering it, which was very helpful! We saved the half chicken to take home and eat for dinner, but we did eat the cornbread that came with it. It was dangerously good. The honey butter that came with it wasn't too sweet, so it had a perfect balance. Finally, the lemon cream pie was very good. The graham crust was crumbly, but held the pie together. \n\nWe can't wait to go back in the future!",

So, when we got to Asheville for vacation we vowed \"no mexican food.\" But...after a few drinks at Burial Brewing, tacos were exactly what we wanted, so we broke our vow for Bartaco. I am so glad we did.\n\nI loved that everything was small and you needed to order multiple things to make a meal. I am one of those people who wants to try everything on the menu, so this makes me happy. \n\nThe food was excellent. We had guac, tuna poke, a tuna taco, a fish taco, and spicy cucumber salad. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. I loved that you could sub out lettuce for the taco shell. I have no doubt that this place would survive here, even in an oversaturated taco market such as Austin, TX.\n\nAlso, the prices were so dang reasonable. We were fatigued from paying $50 a meal in downtown Asheville and got away for under $40 for more/better food. The atmosphere was great - we loved dining on the patio.\n\nI wish we would have come earlier in our trip, because we definitely wanted to go back. You have something special, Bartaco!",

Usually, leftover wings tend to get soggy and kind of unappetizing. Not these! They were just as good the next day! \nI also tried the spicy pork bulgogi this time around. Spicy at about a level 3, which is good. Not so spicy that you can't taste anything but heat, but not too mild, either. Delicious. It was basically a home run, as is everything that I've had here. \nThe appetizers that they put out are delicious, too. The kimchi in this place is so good that we bought a half-pint container to take home with us.\nI don't know if I mentioned it before, but the staff in this place is great. Friendly, attentive, and patient.\nDolsot House is a hidden gem. Try it, trust me!",

  "text": "For all you faithful Yelp friends who read my reviews, you know that I am a lover of high quality stationery, paper, pen and ink shops like this.  So like a moth to a flame, I was drawn into this beautiful shop in downtown New Orleans which also happens to be on one of my favorite streets in the French Quarter.\n\nLet me start by saying that the owners are wonderful people.  This becomes almost immediately apparent upon entering.\nThey are welcoming, helpful and kind. \nTheir store is irresistable and so lovely with eye-catching items everywhere you look.  There are beautiful writing implements, inks and ink wells, exquisite European stationery, wrapping papers, calligraphy sets, gorgeously bound journals and the like.\n\nAs I browsed around, I suddenly espied the sealing wax and seals.  Oh my.  Years ago when I was in junior high and high school in NYC, the ancient practice of affixing one's seal into a pool of colored wax on the outside of envelopes had been resurrected.\nSeals and sealing wax were readily found in shops everywhere.\n \nI still have my original initial seal that I used back then.  Nary an envelope left my hand for years without my seal across the flap.\n\nThe use of seals on letters and documents can be traced back to the Old Testament and I've always thought it a lovely way to close an envelope with a personal logo, totem or initial. \n\nHere, I found an array of Italian-made seals along with an assortment of richly colored waxes.  I fell hard once again.   \nAll things considered, given the things that I love and that interest me, I should have been born a few hundred years ago. \n\nBoth the owners showed me some new sealing techniques which include using both wax and ink stamps.  I walked out with two new seals, an assortment of inks and quality wax sticks and I'm all set now to emblazon the envelopes on my soon to be written out Christmas cards and envelopes.   \n\nIf you're into beautiful pens and good inks as my husband is, this too is your place.\nThere is a wide variety from which to choose of both.\nThere are many things here that would make wonderful and unique gifts.\n\nIf you can't get to Royal Street in New Orleans any time soon, check out the website.\nThis is a small, local shop and any questions you might have I'm certain would be readily answered via phone call as well.\n\nStopping in this pretty shop can't help but remind us of the art and beauty of writing by hand and creating something lovely with quality materials.",

This place is beautiful, the people working here are so sweet, and the exhibits are lovely.  What's not to love?!\n\nI went here for the Chihuly glass exhibit in 2010 and have gone the past two years for the Scarecrow exhibits.  Local groups (middle school classes, non-profits, etc) make fun scarecrows and I make it my mission to find them all.  I missed the treehouse exhibit (to my eternal shame, really) but the Walden house was still up and it was so perfectly done that it made me madder that I missed the whole exhibit.  I saw their trains exhibit (more for the kiddies but they had to-scale landmarks from around Nashville around the tracks which were amaing in themselves).  The fall, to me, is the best time to come here, with the changes leaves, the mums, and the scarecrows.  It's fun to find them all, scattered around the gardens.  You can have a picnic here if you want, or enjoy their Pineapple Room.  This is a GREAT place to spend a Saturday taking pictures and walking around with friends.  Dress appropriately, because there are lots of hills (welcome to Nashville!) and it can get warm or cool depending on the day in October.  Spring is another good time to come, but fall is my favorite.\n\nWeat comfy boots, bring your camera and a picnic basket, and explore this beautiful place.  And give it 5 starts because, come on, this place more than deserves all the accolades it gets!!  It's pure magic, an oasis of unspoiled beauty and art, and a real Nashville treasure.",

  "text": "I'm not gonna lie; after reading all of the other (mostly bad) reviews about Poptions, I wasn't looking forward to my visit. Bad service? Mediocre popcorn? Did I mention that I'm not a huge popcorn fan to begin with? Gahh!!\n\nBut I had a Groupon that was about to expire, so I headed up on a Sunday afternoon to see what it was all about.\n\nI walked in and was immediately greeted by a super friendly girl working the counter. Hmm, not bad. I took some time to study the menu and see what they had to offer. \n\nWow -- they had a TON of varieties of popcorn! It was actually a bit overwhelming. The girl told me I could sample as much as I wanted. Nice. Not wanting to be greedy, I just asked for a sample of the gooey butter cake popcorn. It was deliciously sweet and really did taste like gooey butter cake! Yum. \n\nI went with the Over the Top popcorn (caramel popcorn topped with dark and white chocolate) and the specialty flavor of the day, which was some sort of praline popcorn (caramel popcorn mixed with sweet pralines and some other goodies that I don't remember!)\n\nTwo small-ish bags of the stuff came to about $15. Yeah. Not cheap at all. Thank God for my Groupon! :)\n\nI paid for my order and received a 'frequent flyers' punch card; buy 10 bags of popcorn, get one free. Cool. I also received a coupon for a free scoop of Serendipity ice cream (yes, they serve that here as well!) with a $10 order. Next time! \n\nAnyway, I walked back to the car with my goodies and immediately opened the bags to sample my purchases. \n\nOH. MY. GOSH. This popcorn was absolutely amazing. And this is coming from someone who really isn't crazy about popcorn. The Over the Top popcorn was SO good. Like, eyes rolling in the back of your head good. I haven't felt that sort of ecstasy since...well, we won't get into that. But it was GOOD. And the praline popcorn was just as delicious. \n\nSo after a few bites of each flavor, I knew I had to go back for more. Now. I rushed back into the store and ordered two more bags; this time, a bag of caramel and a bag of caramel cheddar mix. Both were amazing. \n\nAnd then I drove all the way to my grandmother's house to drop off all four bags of popcorn. Because if there's one person who knows their popcorn, it's her! \n\nShe loved it. LOVED it. And she's now the proud owner of four decadent bags of specialty popcorn. Because there's NO WAY I would be able to control myself around that crack...err...popcorn. \n\nBOTTOM LINE -- This popcorn is amazing. The service was fine while I was there. Yes, it's expensive, but you shouldn't be eating this popcorn everyday, anyway. It's well worth the price, in my opinion. This is one of those 'once a year' treats. \n\nGo here. GO GO GO GO GO.",

My old gym (Weston Fitness, see review update) had lost it's luster and began charging extra for my favourite class, so we parted ways after 2 years of having a really good thing going. It felt serious.\n\nAnyways, I never think about Weston anymore because Unite has totally swept me off my feet. The class format keeps things moving and helps you challenge yourself in manageable increments. I'm still sore after every class and constantly looking for more time in my schedule where I can squeeze in another class here and there. I can't get enough. I've done classes with Bill and Juliet and they are both incredible. I always end up dripping sweat and I'm not much of a sweaty person so that really takes a lot of effort for me. They are positive and motivational and great teachers.\n\nCan't speak to the locker facilities much because I always go home beforehand to change and then go back home afterward, but they have lockers available with locks so I don't have to schlep my padlock anymore. Love that.",

  "text": "alright, let me give it to you this way... i LOVE steak! i LOVE meat, in general. so i was totally looking forward to bob's steak house as it is known as one of the best steak joints in tucson. my personal opinion, it's definitely not the best steak i have ever had in my life. my hubby and i still talk about how disappointed we are. we paid the same as other high end steak houses yet left feeling just not satisfied. \n\noverall, staff were nice. very courteous! food came out at a great pace. would i come back? no, as i have personally had better flavorful steak in my lifetime. i am however very thankful that they allowed us to bring our daughter with us. they also allowed us to be seated earlier than our reservation.\n\nordered:\n*Lobster tail-tasted a bit fishy to me. Definitely had an after taste after every bite. \n*Cream corn- not very sweet. There really wasn't much flavor to it. I felt like I needed to add something to it to give it that omph factor. \n*Sautéed mushrooms- huge mushroom pieces. \n*Kids chicken tenders- came with a drink a side. Which we got fruits. \n*crab cakes- fell apart very easily. Not the typical crab cake I've had in the past. This was the best tasting item I've tried here. \n*cote de beouf bone in 22oz-$55 made perfectly medium. Lacked in flavor. I ended up dipping it in ketchup to make it go down. a good piece of seasoned meat should not need me to add any additional flavoring to it.\n\nFree bread- holy cow us this thing humongous! It's like where do I even begin! Now eating it would result in one of the following: it won't look cool anymore, guilt as I ate way too much bread, guilt I didn't finish it and now they're gonna toss it and I am being wasteful. Either way a lose lose situation for me. \n\nbob, you are definitely a solid 3 stars. thanks for your hospitality! \n\nTips:\n* free self parking. \n*reservations accepted. \n*cash and credit card accepted \n*they have high chairs. \n*they have kids menu.\n*restroom is available.\n*dimmed lighting.\n*full bar is available. \n*located on the golf course.",

I really didnt like the texture of those* their vibe alive salad *minus the dressing I will sub that for something else.. since I really hate sweet dressings\n\nWraps: Their taco wrap is delicious and so are their rainbow wraps. \n\nDesserts: Their brownies are baked w/ applesauce.. super moist and delicious. Not traditionally sweet.. so they are my top favorite baked goods here. Their lemon bar w/ strawberry sauce was good although it was just a little too \"flour-y\" for me.. of course their coconut/mango/papaya pudding... my favorite\n\nSmoothies/and drinks Their vanilly willy smoothie is my top favorite.. I substitute protein powder w/ dates though, and their vegan 8 is super delicious although sadly I finish that drink off way to quickly... \n\nFunky Munkey sub coconut milk w/ coffee = hyper monkey = =D =D =D \n\nSpecials that vary: Their specials are what keep me on my toes, today their lentil loaf w/ spicy kale + brown rice pilaf was exceptional.. and so was their mango carrot chai smoothie .... sooo delicious and so filling, but in a good way. I can seriously eat bucketfuls of their sauteed spicy kale. I also liked the lasagna they offered sometime last week... \n\nI never ever feel weighed down after eating lunch from Urban Fresh. \nThanks to Kathy and the staff here for always being so friendly, flexible and helping me make great healthy food choices in such a delicious easy way!",

My mom doesn't eat meat and my grandmother has an aversion to salty foods, and our waiter spent a couple minutes with each of them as he went over the menu and tried to find something that would fit their needs. Superb service! The food was also delicious. We started with some shareable items (think Olives and other small dishes) and they were well portioned and tasty. I'd also note that The Dandelion has a great drink menu and some worthwhile cocktails.\n\nFor meals, we varied from fish to steak to burgers. Everyone was satisfied with their food and my typically picky grandmother (who admittedly did send her first dish back) found something that she really enjoyed. After trying everything my family ordered, I'm convinced that you can't go wrong with any dish here. So my suggestion would be to chat with your waiter or waitress and work to figure out exactly what you're in the mood for. I'm sure you'll love what they bring out for you.",

A long strip of delicate, thinly-sliced duck was served alongside house-made hay butter, a raw, farm-fresh egg still in its shell, and a hot skillet.  Our server cracked the egg into the skillet tableside and told us to begin eating when we thought the egg was done.  Inventive and fun, +1 M.  The problem was, the skillet wasn't hot enough to cook the egg whites all the way through, and we were starving... so after about a minute of staring longingly at our appetizer, we just dipped our prosciutto into raw egg.  It was still flavorful, but probably not as good as it would have been if our egg had actually been cooked. \n\nOur main courses, the barramundi and short rib, were also plated beautifully, and were better executed than the appetizer and really enjoyable.  The short rib was the clear favorite - it was flavorful and rich without being fatty.  The barramundi was a little dry, but was helped tremendously by its accompaniments.\n\nIn terms of ambiance, head to M on a nice night and sit in the garden.  It was rainy the day we visited so we sat inside.  It was still nice, but a walk through the garden told us M has the potential to be something special.",

Interesting sight to behold for agnostics like me that don't subscribe to one Bible of fitness.  My only issues are the overall cleanliness and the lack of space.  Again, this is a very affordable gym, but just remember, you get what you pay for.",

It's hard to gauge a place when you don't have a lot of say so I'm your selection but I really do like what I've had here so far. \nThe atmosphere is hip and lively and they have private rooms for parties. The parking is a little confusing but after hours you can just park on the lot because the gate is left up . \n\nIt's very similar to Ruth's Chris so if you like that you will love it here \n\nService is top notch and for a large group efficient. \nI would like to try it as a private diner",

  "text": "Been here for dinner twice with my boyfriend. Once in September and another thanksgiving weekend. Very  Impressed especially since it is a newly opened restaurant . I believe it opened August 2020, a month after COVID reopenings. Has a large covered  outdoors picnic style lunch benches area attached to restaurant.  There are also several side walk tables . The bar area is small and very limited indoor seating. They do not take reservations last I went in November.  The first time we went , put our names down on the waiting list and about 45 mins to 1 hr wait on a Saturday around 7:30.  \n\nDRINKS:\n A big fan of their margarita cocktails, \"mezcalita\" and the seasonal cranberry one we had over Thanksgiving weekend. I don't like mezcal but you can sub tequila same price.  Their \"mezcalita\" is essentially a  mezcal spicy margarita - fresh lime, agave , fresh pineapple, jalapeño,  cilantro, tajin (10 dollars). I tried the \" jungle cat\"  because I saw a lot of people ordering it and loving it. It was well made but too sweet for me. I like cocktails more on the tart or sour side.  Our server no problem subbed it out for another mezcalita when I expressed I didn't like the sweetness. \n\nSTARTERS:\nSo sad they no longer had street corn on the menu when we visited in November. Corn, a summer vegetable, so that's probably why it was no longer offered because there is nooo way that was not a  crowd favorite.  My boyfriend and I looove street corn and this was done just the way we love it--1. on the cobb, 2. charrrred, 3. Lots of mayo/ aoili  and cotija cheese!   Being that it's fall, crispy brussels probably took its place. Brussels  were really good because they were charrrred and  all crispy.  We almost always order the  brussels if it's on a menu. Nice to see a  crispy brussels dish without the the usual cheese and  cripy bacon/ pork toppings. I loved the acidity of the accoutrements of jicama, pickle red onions , apple and touch of sweetness with the agave. Fritto misto (15 dollars)- aka fried vegetables and shrimp. What a smart way to get someone to eat their vegetables! Fried avocado yum! But  as a starter for two for us , just a little heavy since we planned on getting another starter along  with our own mains.  2nd  visit  we ordered the Jerk octopus and it didn't come til after we mentioned to  our server we were still waiting for it. It came out  after  the Brussels and we were  staring our entrees . We could tell it was rushed/ forgotten. The jerk seasoning gave it a lot of flavor but it was a little fishy and not crispy enough. What looks like char in the pictures is  the jerk marinade.  This is the third time we attempted to order octopus at a restaurant  and made us realized maybe octopus is not for us.\n \nMAINS:\nOur two mains we both loved were whole fried snapper fish and the snapper a la plancha filet with saffron rice. The whole snapper fish fried to perfection without being greasy.  Had it back in September when they made it with charred corn. Has some different accompaniments now.  Love the portion size of the fish in both dishes. The 2nd time  we went the snapper a la plancha dish was  somewhat different . I added both pictures below. There was no ginger scallion sauce, which after trying it the 2nd time without sauce, we unanimously agreed it  was what made the dish wow!   We loved the first version much better, although this version is also good, a sauce is needed since everything is so \"dry\" -not in a bad way dry. It's just that crispy skin fish, fried rice with chorizo needs some more moisture than  the drops of  romesco verde sauce can give to these components. This time it also had no mint, or summer squash. Our sever explained that they used seasonal ingredients and the menu items sometimes will have variations based on season for sourcing ingredients. Which I can appreciate.  I was just so excited from the first time we got it I didn't even bother reading description to notice it had changed. One kink I usually find with newly opened restaurants is customer service. But Wild Child both occasions  exceeds my customer service expectations. Because I expressed that the dish was different than last time I ordered and didn't realize it was different this time around, my server offered us a complimentary desert.  On our November visit I tried the pan seared  scallop (32 dollars) which was an asian flavor profile. We both loved it, because we tend to also order seared  scallops often and we can't recall having it with Asian flavors.  This version had bok choy, roasted Japanese sweet potatoes, oyster mushrooms, pickled shiitake relish, sweet potatoe apple purree. Scallops were big and juicy,  browned and seared to perfection.\n\nAll in all I'm excited to come back and I have been raving about it since my first visit. Two amazing dining experiences solidifies this  as a 5 star restaurant for me!",

  "text": "This retro art themed lodge is truly an oasis in the desert! It was just happenstance that I was lucky enough to find this hotel as I was driving back to Vegas. This old motel lodge turned retro artsy chique, is surly a treat if your an art lover and have an appreciation for independent local artists. \n\nSo, I found this gem off Expedia because I was looking for a spur-of-the-moment overnight stay as I was not looking forward to pulling into an uncomfortable rest area on my way back home. As you know they offer bargain deals on such sites, and indeed it was! Even so, their usual rates are pretty low due to the fact that the establishment is still a baby and just opened last October. So, if you're in the area take advantage of the low rates, now!\n\nWhen I pulled in, I was surprised because this place matched my vibe! I really didn't want to leave even though I was there for only a few hours, lol. Murals are all around on the outside and when walking in you're greeted with an art gallery full of local art. I also did not expect to be treated so nicely because it was 3 AM--and yet, I certainly was :) The gentleman at the front desk (didn't catch his name) was friendly, attentive, informative of the amenities, and made sure to let me know when the FREE breakfast would be served! Inside it's set up like art gallery to which all the art on display is also for sale and supports the local arts community. It has a retro trendy vibe with a super-cute bar top where they serve craft local beer and wine. They don't have any food service as of yet, however, they offer a free complimentary oatmeal bar with all the healthy toppings your happy heart desires, to kickstart your day :)) There's also a quaint, little gift shop which offers trendy logo T's, blankets, coffee,  and some gorgeous, artsy goodies made by local artists such as poetry, coloring books and children's books. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor areas to socialize, play games, relax at the pool, and enjoy life! Your stay also includes a very clean, retro-chique room with a big flat-screen, natural, glorious-smelling body products from Pharmacopia, an extremely comfy bed and overall very pleasant atmosphere. It's also very quiet even though you're right by the freeway. The best part of it all, it's pet friendly-complete with doggie areas outside which you can use while you admire the 20+ murals painted throughout the property. And believe me, it's also so tidy you won't even notice the doggie zones until you see dogs walking around lol.\n\nAs for the service, from the management to the staff--it's absolutely excellent! They also give you a token for a free beverage at the bar, so I used mine and had a nice chat with the lovely Jesse, who's also a local artist with her art on display! Hotel tidbit: I asked her how the old renovated lodge received its name, and she informed me that it's named after a mountain range in California (I think). The service is great and on top of that, they seem happy to work there :D It certainly shows--I'd love to work there too! It's a happy, welcoming atmosphere and surely I'll be back...next time it'll just be to chill and enjoy a longer stay!",

Sometimes this restaurant can get extremely crowded, so make a reservation or go for a late lunch! The service is always excellent and the waiters are knowledgeable on the menu. This time that I went, our waitress Sam was very attentive and made our dining experience pleasurable! The sushi always tastes fresh and unique. My favorite roll so far here is the Havana roll!! If you're not a sushi fan, I recommend the basil chicken or Mongolian beef! The only drawback to this restaurant is that it's extremely loud inside once it starts to fill up!",

At lunch time on a Tuesday I managed to find a meter just on the next block. \n\nUpon entering I discovered that you place your order at the counter and they call your number when it comes out. There were only a few people in front of me, so the pressure was on to figure out what I needed to try. Luckily the guy at the counter was super helpful. In the end I went for a Burnt Cheeseburger with a Duck Patty and added bacon and a side of half Sweet Tots half Waffle Fries. \n\nBurger - Going with the Duck Patty was a solid choice! It definitely had that rich, buttery flavor that duck should. And I thought the burnt cheese was unique and had a deliciously sharp flavor. The bacon was thick cut and the pickles were obviously house made and fresh. Honestly, I'd probably just get this burger again on my next visit!\n\nTots and Fries - The tots had a mild sweetness, but you really do need a dipping sauce for them. The waffle fries had the perfect crunch and would be great on their own, but I loved dipping them in ranch. \n\nI also appreciated that this place doesn't up-charge you for everything. No extra charge for the fancy patty and no extra charge for any sauces. This place is great!!",

You could convince me to come here almost any day of the year, except for St. Patrick's Day when all the bar amateurs come out in force. \n\nDuring happy hour they have free popcorn for snacking, really awesome trivia on Thursdays, and live music on Fridays and Saturdays with no cover. It's just generally a nice place to kick back with friendly folks while sipping on a frosty beverage (or one of their many whiskys).\n\nIf you're not ordering an Irish brew, I'd taste it first. I think because it doesn't turn around as fast as some of the others they sometimes get a little off-flavor (I'm look at you, Great Basin Icky). \n\nBartenders are always nice and I've even seen a dog or two in here when it's slow.",

  "text": "Ok, I took off a star because it is so darned expensive! Fortunately they have a deal where you can get an appetizer/soup/salad, an entree, and a glass of wine for $35 which isn't bad for the quality of food and service.\n\nIt's a small restaurant with a bar on the right as you enter, fine linens with fresh flowers and an open kitchen which is quite rare in fine dining joints. Our server Valerie was attentive but not overbearing.  I dined with three friends and we all got the special. First we had the hot sourdough rolls which were yummy and I love real butter! Then I ordered the crab cakes (which were yummy crab without breading-see my picture) and fried mirliton-delicious! One friend ordered the chargrilled oysters which I tasted and it was yummy, and another friend ordered the scallops which she enjoyed. For my main dish I ordered the tenderloin which had blue cheese on top and had shredded beef underneath. It came with snow pea pods (I think) and a potato side.it was tasty! My friends ordered the flounder and they enjoyed it. But dessert was the best with a creamy creme brûlée with whipped cream and fresh strawberries on the side-amazing! And we so had the flourless chocolate cake with strawberries and cream on the side which was good. I don't remember what kind of red wine my friends ordered but they all enjoyed it. And I liked the Pinot Grigio that I ordered as well.\n\nIt was a lovely experience and we closed the place out where they had to turn on the lights to kick us out! Hehe\n\nHappy Dining!",

You can either shop a la carte for meals or buy a pre-selected assortment for a lower price.    \n\nOur only minor quibble is that most of the beef entree contain a lot of baby carrots that do not freeze and cook well.   Very weird texture.   Otherwise absolutely no complaints.  The loaded soup was insanely good.   Sausages and peppers were delicious.

  "text": "Winnie's. This is our go-to brunch/lunch spot in the Manayunk area. The crowds are always huge, but the lines go quickly. The food has been delicious every time we've gone. I think we've visited about 3-4 times already and everything has been spot on. \n\nHuevos Rancheros: I ordered the Huevos Rancheros without the cheese and sour cream (since I'm dairy-free). There were no issues when it arrived. It came out on a layer of corn tortillas, eggs, homemade and delicious salsa, as well as guacamole and scallions. The flavors really blended well together. The salsa was fresh, not overly spicy. I'm not sure why I never think about putting guacamole on eggs when I make them at home. It could be put on everything.\n\nThe \"Cure\": If this doesn't cure your hangover, you're doing it wrong. Holy smokes, it looked glorious. It would also have given me the worst stomach ache from all the deliciousness but I'm sure it would be worth it. Included in the dish was ham, bacon, peppers, onions, home fries, Swiss cheese, scrambled eggs topped with biscuits and turkey chorizo gravy. This just looked like comfort. I didn't take a picture, but damn it looked it. There were a ton of fresh veggies in the dish that seemed to brighten it up. He also mentioned that the gravy wasn't super heavy.\n\nThe atmosphere: The décor at Winnie's makes it seem like it's been around forever. I loved the wooden beams and skylights that really brightened the place up. I also really enjoyed that we were seated very quickly. It was prime time for brunch on Sunday, in addition to being the Kentucky Derby AND Cinco de Mayo. All personnel was really kind and courteous, and hustling their tails off.\n\nHomemade drinks and biscuits:  You can really tell that the chefs really care about every little detail. We ordered a Bloody Maries and it was definitely made fresh. It had a good amount of heat (lots of horseradish) and blended well. It came with a bacon garnish too. In addition to the homemade Bloody Mary, the table was served a mini basket of pieces of bread. The cornbread is by far the best, and I would love an entire basket full of it. The basket also included French baguette pieces and raisin bread.\n\nWith any wait staff, our waitress wasn't super attentive to our table. Although it was super crowded (Cinco de Mayo, Kentucky Derby, AND Sunday brunch), she didn't ask us how our food was. It was delicious. I had an empty glass of water for quite some time. It would have been nice to be refilled.",

Tonight my girlfriend and I ordered clam chowder, fried oysters  & a power burrito with fries. Everything was simple and well executed! The fried oysters retained their flavor through a nice crispy batter & the \"awesome sauce\" complemented spectacularly.

What I don't like is that you find something you love and when you go back they no longer carry it. I also feel that the prices have gone up on the food items over time. Buying at a warehouse and in bulk should be cheaper, but it's not. Many things in meat and produce is cheaper at Meijer and at Kroger. I know many people rant and rave about Costco, but now that I've come to my senses and see It as a store to get my money and not a huge overwhelming place, reality has struck. We all pay a yearly fee to shop and really I don't save anything. Today for the first time, and I have been a plus member for years, I had a very rude cashier.

  "text": "You really do get what you pay for.  This was one of my 1-3 times a year \"dip into my savings/swipe my credit card\" splurge on food.  It really is as good as everyone makes it out to be.  \n\nPlan ahead: make reservations and you must be properly dressed, otherwise you can only eat in the lounge.  They start with a tour of the kitchen and the wine cellar (impressive), in small groups at a time.  After that, they seat you.  \n\nWe started with the tuna tartar.  I know what you're thinking...why order raw fish at a steak house?  You do not understand, I actually cannot help it.  I absolutely LOVE tuna tartar.  So, whenever I see it on the menu I must always order it.  I was skeptical and wondering \"what did I get myself into?\"  As soon as I saw the dish, I knew that I had nothing to worry about.  The fish was fresh, the presentation/plating was nice, and most importantly it was really good.  \n\nThey also tossed the salad for use tableside before the steak came out.  I can't remember which cut of steak I ordered and their website is down right now, so I can't access their menu.  It was similar to a Filet Mignon; I think it was the Chateaubriand.  We each had a different cut of steak and wine to pair, based on the waiter's recommendation.  My steak was perfectly cooked (I like it medium), tender, and nicely seasoned.  They were also attentive the entire time.\n\nAfter we finished our meal, we were led to the dessert room, which is located upstairs.  A new server came over and took care of us.  Dessert was also yummy; we had bread pudding and the special of the day, a seasonal dessert.  However, I was more impressed by dinner; although I loved the decor and ambience of the dessert room better.  Semi-private booths (wood planks that extended from floor to ceiling, against an exposed brick wall and formed somewhat of a half-circle) filled the dessert room floor.  There was also an old telephone device mounted to the wall of each booth. We were able to change the music and switch between 6 \"stations/channels.\"  There was also a button to call for your server.  The room was more dimly lit than downstairs.  I uploaded a few pictures so you can see.  \n\nAll in all, great experience, but I can't afford to dine like this very often.",

  "text": "Definitely a refreshing take on Indian food for Indy, and lunch buffet with unlimited chai is a steal at $6.99. Temperature of buffet items should have been a bit hotter, spice levels for many foods could have been increased, and amount of fried items seemed exorbitant... But nonetheless we enjoyed our lunch a lot!\n\nSpice Nation specializes in South Indian vegetarian foods, mostly featuring Tamilian foods. (The cooks are from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu). Foods we sampled in the lunch buffet and also brought to table upon request included oothappam, chapatti, idly, dosa, rice, dal tadka, rasam, sambhar, eggplant curry, kidney bean and chickpea curry, vada, pickles, various chutneys, curd, mushroom manchurian, vegetable korma, bitter gourd curry, vegetable fried rice, and naan. The server said the lunch buffet changes daily. \n\nSome vegetarian items I would have loved to see included on the buffet: papads, more dosas, samosas, parotas, poori, a paneer dish or 2, a bhindi/okra curry, mango lassi. \n\nAlso, I'd love to see some Indian foods from other southern regions!! Keralan vegetarian options, Goan vegetarian foods and some Chettinad vegetarian choices  would be tasty. Spice Nation you can do it!!\n\nThe server told us that the Friday night dinner buffet has more South Indian foods, Saturday night they do Indo-Chinese foods (gobi and mushroom manchurian, etc), and Sunday they feature chaats (snacks) like bhel puri, panni puri, etc.\n\nService was great - we asked if we could skip naan and get chapati instead and the server went to check. Recommend SN for those who seek vegetarian and vegan Indian food not generally found in Indy's India Garden/Shalimar type restaurants.",

My favorite part of Perkins is their dessert. I always look forward to it! They have a lot of new flavors like birthday cake and a chocolate peanut butter muffin (they used to have a peanut butter muffin that was delicious but they got rid of it and now they have a similar chocolate version) . The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. It is always a little dark in the restaurant which makes is not very pleasant when dining in. However I love getting bakes goods to go and also have never had a problem while eating in. Overall a decent Perkins restaurant! \nI will update my review when I eat in again!",

We started with bread and prociotto which was delicious and got us started with the wine we brought. My spouse and I each had appetizers for our meals (the burrata toast and panzanella salad) and we were not disappointed with the size of our meals, which left enough room for desert. \n\nOur friends got two pasta dishes that they really loved. They were smart and couldn't decide what to get so they split and shared the sausage and broccoli rab Campanella and the pyramid pasta. \n\nWe finished the meal with the blueberry cheesecake and the pistachio cannoli. The cannoli was outstanding. Im a bit of a NY cheesecake purist and Mercato's had a little lemon in it so that one was a little bit of a miss for me flavorwise. Check out the pictures because everything looked amazing!!\n\n5/5 stars will definitely be back for date night!",

The goat was very tender and the gravy was savory. The yucca was perfect for sopping up the gravy. Husband had the Parillada Mexicana and loved it. Grilled shrimp, Mexican sausage, chicken and beef sautéed with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms and peppers. They kicked it up a notch for him and added jalapeños. They also had a live singer who was honestly, supremely talented. We were surprised at his pipes.

  "text": "Impressive. We went to the Taste of Seminole Heights walking tour this past weekend, and it began here. We've never been before, so we stopped inside to utilize our tickets for two beers. However after we ordered two beers the bartender advised us that the sample size beers or outside and then we would have to pay for our beers. We took one sip and we were fine with that deal. We found some other people that we knew and gave them our sample beer tickets. I had a Funky Kolsch Medina, and loved it. Light, crisp and perfect for a warm day filled with walking. Sitting at the bar it took me a little while to figure out what was actually going on inside of this shop, I guess I'm just a little slow sometimes. There were all of these blue bins and I thought that it was just some of the supplies that they were using to brew their beer. To me it was interesting that they would just sort of be out in the open. After I got about halfway through my beer, I realized that this wasn't just a brewery, it was a place that sold supplies for people who make homebrew and wine. I know absolutely nothing about brewing beer or making wine but that didn't stop me from walking around and taking a look at the wares. I've got to tell you that I wasn't really sure about what half of the stuff was, but it looked pretty cool. There were cheese cloths, corks, tubing, live yeast, dry yeast and hops for days. There was a guy in there with a buscarte and long list of supplies that he needed, and it was cool to see him stocking up. Like I said, I don't know anything about making beer, but what I can tell you is that I've never actually seen a place that offers supplies for people who want to brew. For me, that makes this place very unique.\n\nAfter we completed the Taste of Seminole Heights tour, we came back into Southern Brewing and had two more beers before heading home.\n\nLoved the place, loved the staff and will definitely be back.",

  "text": "I've lived in the Tampa Bay area for about 1.5 years now and have heard many great things about the Columbia Restaurant and it's rich history.  It's definitely somewhere that I wanted to try and we finally got the chance.  \nWe called around 6 pm on a Sunday evening and made a reservation for 8pm.  We were seated just a few minutes after we arrived.  \n\nThe artwork and decor is beautiful and shows so much history. I'd love to tour the restaurant and hear all the history of it. \nThe service was slow - they were quick to bring us bread, but took forever to get our initial water and refills. Drink refills were just as slow.  Our bread was pretty much gone before the waiter came back to take our orders. He just wasn't too attentive.\nThe menu's are OVERWHELMING!!!  There is a wine menu that looks like a textbook, it even has a table of contents. I would've loved to have time to read through it and pick something out, but wow ---overwhelming! As I skimmed,  I did see a bottle for $1400.  I like my wine, but am just not that much of a connoisseur! There was also a \"wine tour\" menu, which listed about 8 wines specifically being sold this month.  \nAnd the actual menu...not overly huge, but the descriptions are so lengthy and detailed, it was just a lot to take in. There were definitely a lot of options.  We ordered the beef tenderloins and the stuffed grouper, both were very good. My wife asked for the asparagus as her side instead of the mixed veggies and was told it would be a charge for an additional side, okay, no problem. She just didn't want the mushrooms that came with the mixed veggies.  When the food came out, she got mixed veggies (mushrooms and all) but no asparagus. Fortunately we weren't charged for them either. Everyone else in our party ordered some type of sea food dish, which they all seemed to enjoy.  We also had the deviled crab appetizer that I'd heard so much about. I wasn't a fan but everyone else in our party enjoyed them. As for drinks, the guys ordered Mojitos and the girls ordered wine. By the end of the night, we all were drinking Mojitos. They were probably some of the best Mojitos we've ever had, not too minty and not too sweet.  \n\nA nice touch to our meal was that in the month of September, Columbia donates 5% of each bill to the local charity organization of your choice.  \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our dinner and drinks. This is the type of place you have to try once, or maybe take visitors to for the cultural history.  I just don't see it being somewhere I would go to regularly.   \nFor an appetizer, dinner and drinks for two people you can expect your bill to be close to $100 - give or take $20 both ways.",

  "text": "Visited last night because I NEEDED mussels. I've been craving them for a very long time and I have tried multiple places around Indy and have not been satisfied. \nWe had to wait a short time, which is totally understandable. They had some seating in the main entrance so we made ourselves comfortable. The seating is very close quarters. If you have anxiety about being in a small, louder space, I would recommend sitting outside. The service was amazing! One of the things that will turn me off of a place immediately is poor service. Our server Joe was very polite and quick, and moved efficiently. I didn't know what flavor of mussels to choose and he gave great suggestions and didn't rush us. \n  \nI ordered the Provencal Moules Frites, which is 2 lbs. of Prince Edward Island mussels and a cone of pommes frites (or, to simplify, the best fries you've ever had), and a large slice of French bread. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Confit Mitraillette, which is a large French bread sandwich that is BURIED in the decadent pommes frites. I was full for the rest of the night. I was very pleased the portions, I often order mussels and wish there were more, but with this meal I was full at the end and struggled a little to finish! My boyfriend loved the duck, it was perfectly cooked and he loved it so much he opened the sandwich and ate it by itself! My boyfriend is a very critical individual with a chef for a father, so this speaks volumes of how well the duck is prepared here. You get sauces with your fries and I loved the mustard and aoili. Overall loved the restaurant. We will definitely be back!",

Compared to the chains it actually costs you less for their bog standard burger with fries than it will for a combo meal at one of the \"big chains\". \n\nThey're also a friendly choice for the smaller members of the family.

My girlfriend and I came here because we wanted to try something different. Not having any idea what to order or expect we asked our awesome server for advice. \n\nHere is the break down of what we got:\n\n10 piece wings- 2 flavors, honey sesame and Diablo. Both so incredibly delicious and flavorful. \nwings were crispy yet juicy- it seemed as though it had a breading to them that was fried perfectly.\n\nChicken Bulgogi Dolsot (chicken rice bowl)- we ordered the spicy chicken but you can order BBQ. Interestingly, it comes out in a clay bowl?! (no idea if its clay but its a cool looking bowl) and its super hot and it continues to cook once it comes out so be careful you don't burn the rice- burnt rice is something I love so I let it get crispy. Loaded with veggies and flavor this was amazing!!! So good in so many ways. Full of flavor, meat, and veggies. Spice level 3 but I would go higher next time, maybe a 4 or even a 5.\n\nL.A Kalbi (beef short ribs) SOOOOOO good! Perfectly grilled, juicy, and flavorful but not dry or anything. Thin pieces and lots of them. I loved this dish.\n\nOver all- this was a great experience and exceeded any expectations I had for this place. \nI am beyond happy that we tried DH; I cant wait to come back. \nENJOY!!

  "text": "I booked a private party at this studio as a birthday celebration and it was so much fun. Beverly, the studio manager, helped me to coordinate an afrobeat/hip dance class as the theme for the evening, and everything turned out great! Lehla, one of their dance instructors, taught the class and incorporated some zumba moves as well as some African popular and traditional dance steps. Plus, the music was poppin! They were able to incorporate my song requests too! \n\nIt was a workout (and pretty much nonstop), but it looked like my friends enjoyed themselves, and of course, I loved it! The moves were a good balance of challenging and basic, and I really felt liked I burned calories. It was quite a lot for over an hour of class, and we got there a little late (parking, ugh), which wound up cutting off about 15 minutes of dance instruction. Even still, it was a full, high-intensity class. That said, my dance theme was customized. I don't know if anyone else is as crazy as me to do the same kind of dance for a party, but just a word of warning, if you do, that it was intense. It wasn't a situation where breaks weren't allowed though and the atmosphere was relaxed.\n\nA tip to be sure to bring water. I unfortunately did not bring enough for me and my friends, and there was no access to any there. Also, the studio is one floor, and this location wasn't very large. We had about 8 people and it was a good amount of space for us to spread out, but I'm sure it'd be a wee bit tight for larger groups. We also brought a little spread of fruit, cheeses and drinks (you can bring wine or champagne). It worked out great. I would just make sure if you bring snacks for a party that they are compact, since there isn't much space. We used the studio close to closing time, which meant we had to pack all the food up quickly.",

We also indulged in cocktails because it was our first visit and why not. Usually I don't order cocktails at 3pm, but the uniquely crafted menu was too tempting to turn down. I loved the side salad with the house vinaigrette. We tried the fries, too. Not my favorite. They were more potato-y than crispy. \n\nThe drinks were not very big, and cost $9+. Not sure I'll get one again, but it was fun to try. My friend got the $13 Red Velvet Elvis milkshake complete with vanilla vodka. Man. It is a meal in itself and is not for the faint of heart. I gave it a try, and it was delicious. I was satisfied with a regular ol' (giant) Red Velvet Elvis cupcake. I do have to say, I was disappointed the desserts were limited to the cupcakes, larger cake versions, and only 2 lemon bar options. I was expecting more. \n\nThere's street parking, which can get tight during busy weekends in Zionsville, but we didn't have any trouble mid-afternoon. There's a giant patio when it's warm for additional seating and garage doors that open up to the outside. There is also a bigger room behind the dessert counter that I imagine would accommodate groups.",

  "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BAKERY. I had an extreme urge for some gourmet cupcakes at 5 pm after a long day at work and of course everywhere around me was closed. That's when I stumbled upon this bakery that happened to be open til 8 and I couldn't be more thankful that the places around me closed early. \n\nI couldn't decide which cupcake to choose so I decided to try 3? I figured that made sense. I also decided to give a mini cheesecake a try because it all looked so good! \n\nMy rating for every sweet I stuffed my face with would be 11/10. The chocolate on chocolate was perfect! Satisfied my chocolatey craving and was super moist. I enjoyed every bite! The carrot cake was very sweet and had the perfect consistency. Not to mention that the icing was the perfect amount of sweet. My favorite cupcake was the red velvet. I'm a sucker for a moist cupcake with some quality cream cheese icing. \n\nI didn't expect to like the cheesecake all that much because I'm not exactly a huge fan but I was pleasantly surprised. The best part was the crust. IT WAS CRUNCHY AND CHOCOLATEY AND HAD CHOCOLATE CHIPS INSIDE!! I took one bite and knew I was doomed to never enjoy cheesecake from anywhere else ever again.",

I ordered via phone and requested the foyager sandwich which is eggs, kale, oyster mushrooms, cheese on a bun.  I asked for them to cut it in half and add ketchup since they didn't have any packets to go.  I got there and decided to get a latte while I waited.  I loved the interior of this restaurant.  Not a lot of seating but very quaint.  I loved that the kitchen was right there where we can see everything they're doing.  They cut the sandwich in half but no ketchup however I wasn't disappointed.  The sandwich was packed with flavor.  I absolutely loved the added touch of the oyster mushrooms!",

However, every single time I'm there, without fail, I will stand at the desk for 10-15 minutes before being waited on while approximately four employees mill about behind the desk and ignore. No \"give me a second.\" no \"we'll be right with you.\" They aren't all putting out emergency fires. We're just ignored. When they get around to acknowledging you, they are polite and nice. But you will wait. And with three dogs, and my mother's fluctuating strength due to various health concerns, this is irritating. Their next check-up is in August, so she can't even take the pups to the car before waiting her required 15 Minutes of Being Ignored after the visit is over.

We tried this restaurant today and we were mildly happy.\n\nThere was only one other person in the restaurant when we arrived, which I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing... The waiters were attentive enough, but not the best servers. The food was pretty good.\n\nI had egg drop soup, which was really delicious--the best egg drop I've had in a while. The crab Rangoon was really good, too, although their duck sauce was kind of weird and red, rather than the usual orange I'm used to. I was super excited to try the cheesesteak egg roll, but it was gross--the meat was gray and it had no cheese and no good flavor. I had the drunken noodles with chicken and it was pretty good and flavorful--the noodles were cooked well. The serving was huge and I took most of it home. My wife had sushi and said she enjoyed it.\n\nThe place could've put the air conditioner on some more, though! It wasn't a particularly hot day, but it was really warm in the restaurant, which made it pretty uncomfortable. \n\nAll in all, we would eat their food again, but probably would get take out.

  "text": "We were sidetracked here and it was a pleasant dinner.\n\nHere's the thing.. I don't think (..and usually not at all but with that I digress *ba dum ching*) higher end restaurants should over power you with any odor.   An over powering smell of fish greeted me at the door and stayed for the whole meal.  \nMy husband says \"But it's a steak and seafood restaurant.\"  Then why doesn't Red Lobster(hush you) stink of fish?  I know fast food joints usually smell like a fried vat of whatever they cook but for nice seating and the pretty view I expected more. I hope it was just bad ventilation for the night.\n\nThe food was good.\n\nAppetizer:\nWe had calamari appetizer, big shock there, and it was good. The first time I think my husband enjoyed it more then I did.\nWine:\nGlass of the  \"Cabernet Sauvignon ~ Mike Shannon Private Label 2006 Napa\" of which was very tasty.  \n\nMain Course & Sides:\nI had a 8 oz fillet, of which I enjoyed very much!\nWe split a side mushrooms and a side of macaroni and cheese.\nBoth were good.\nMy husband had the strip and loved it.\n\nDessert:\nThe desert was the yummy \"Chocolate Dome.\"  \n\n\nThey are priced as an upscale steakhouse should be but I think that the price doesn't equate to the quality expected for what is spent.  Certainly worth giving it try but I would not expect it to be better then other steakhouses within the downtown area.\nI really love the seating with the huge windows that do not leave you feeling exposed but rather opens up the dining experience.  Smartly built.\n\nTLDR: You can not go wrong with the steak.  Overall it was good but nothing that will floor you.  \nIf strong odors bother you, maybe have a glass of wine at the bar to test the mettle of the place before you head to the dining area.",

Now, I am not going to mark it down any stars but I noted my suggestions.\n\nThe Audio tour is off and outdated. They should update the program and also consider automatic chip reading headsets.\n\nDocent tours need a microphone or a boom box voice. I could not hear one thing our tour guy said.\n\nThe cafe was a disaster today. Nowhere to sit because it was raining. Did they not get the memo that this museum is in Florida? There was an extremely rude worker giving dirty looks to customers. I was shocked especially since all of the other workers in the museum were fantastic. I will admit the food is very good though if you can wait out the horrendous service.The food I got was not what I thought it would be from visiting Spain.I had the Pan Con Tomato but it was delicious.The Cafe Con leche is very good too.However, If you know you might have 2,000 guests visiting your Museum why do you only have 3 people working the very small Cafe? It was a 30 to 40 minute wait just to order. I'd consider eating someplace else if this is typical and not just an off day. There are lots of places nearby to eat after your tour. \n\nI might add the admission Price is on the high end of museums but worth it for sure. 2 dollar teacher discount.",

So if it wasn't for the amazing food and drinks I would not go back to this place. I have been here a few time and the last two times I have gone in, the wait staff has not been very good with customer service. One visit my friend ordered a pizza, she took one piece and realized the bottom was really burnt. So we called the waitress over and told her about it. The waitress lifts up the pizza, rolls her eyes, and takes the pizza away, without a single word said. Then Saturday myself and another friend go there. It's an hour wait at 8:00 at night, no big deal we wait, because the food and drinks are amazing. Well we asked for first seating and it's outside. Again, that's fine, it was a cold night, but we had jeans and sweaters on so it's fine. We get our food and our drinks. The waitress ask if we need anything else. I said no just go ahead and bring the check so we can pay and leave when we are done. Again, it's cold outside and we didn't want to wait for the check. The waitress astually laughs and says \" Yeah, I'll bringing in a  little while\" Umm what, excuse me. I want the check on my terms not yours. We never eat all the food and didn't want any more to drink so there was not reason not to bring the check when we asked. We are the customers!!! I will give Ella's another chance only because of the food and drinks. However, if the service it still as bad as it has been I will go to another place. There is plenty more placed popping up on Florida Ave a street over, and even on Nebraska Ave that is similar to Ella's. The things is I have raved about this place and introduce much of my friends and co-workers to Ella's. However, again if the service does not improve I will no longer mention Ella's.",

  "text": "This is a tough review to write, but it's necessary. \n\nI LOVE the food at Han Dynasty, and I'm usually dining at the Old City location, so when we were wandering through Manayunk looking for a lunch spot and saw Han Dynasty it was a no brainer.\n\nWe knew that we wanted dan dan noodles, and some Taiwanese sausage. My fiance and I wanted to split the order of dan dan  as an appetizer and my friend wanted her own as her entree. \n\nSince we were splitting the dan dan we finished our bowl and my friend didn't finish hers (it is a huge portion for one person). The waitress comes over and comments how I finished the entire bowl by saying, \"oh wow. you finished all of that?\" and I explained that we split it, but followed up with, \"But it would be okay if I did finish the entire bowl\" - because, it's not her business how much I eat, and you'd think that a business would be thrilled that a patron loved the meal that much. Anyway- it took me aback a bit.\n\nMy fiance and I get our entrees and we realized that we ordered WAY too much. The waitress comes over and says, \"Oh wow. You finished?\" So if we eat all of it, she says something...we don't eat enough (according to her) she says something. So we get the massive plate of food wrapped up to go along with a few other things and they arrive at the table in a tied plastic bag. We don't think anything of it and head back to center city. The next day we go to dig into our leftovers and the restaurant only gave us 1/4 pint of food- when we literally had a HUGE plate of lo mein that we took 2 bites of. So they must have been upset with us for not finishing it, or thought we didn't need all of our leftovers- whatever the reason- we were sent home with a VERY small amount of food compared to what we wanted wrapped up. Essentially they stole from us. We paid for the full amount and only received a small fraction of it to take home. \n\nLuckily we don't frequent Manayunk, so we won't be back to this location to deal with the judgmental service and spotty doggie bags.",

After the strange/disappointing experience last year it took us while to give them another try, but we finally did, and they seem to have their act together now! Yay! (and the website typos are gone!)\n\nWe called ahead for a tour, showed up and there was an actual tour! Good start! We had a beer in the taproom while we waited, and were encouraged to bring the rest with us once everyone was ready.  Our tour guide wasn't some college kid or retired person who had memorized a script like some other distillery/brewery tours I've been on (ahem, Budweiser).  He was just having a conversation with us and telling us what we wanted to know about his beloved business.  We got some dirt on local competitors and some behind the scenes info on new creations, failed creations and things in the works.  Once the actual tour was over we moved to the tasting room where we got to sample way more booze than I've ever had on a tour, especially for the low price!  We also each got to choose a glass to take home. \n\nThe place is still not marked on the outside of the building, so you have to know where you're going to find it, but overall a 100% improvement from the first unorganized experience!",

If you are looking for cutting edge trendy minimalist food, you may want to go somewhere else.\n\nWe had dinner here the other night before going to a concert at Pioneer Center. What a wonderful experience it was. We created very cordially by the lovely young hostess and as it was earning in the evening, were given a choice of seats - by the bar, by the fire, by the kitchen. We chose by the kitchen in close proximity to the fire. \n\nThe space is warm and inviting with brick walls and comfy chairs and benches. The \"divided light\" windows across the front of the building add to the charm and beauty of the space.\n\nWe decided not to go with the Feast. It was more food then we felt we could eat, but is a good deal since the $75 includes a full five course meal with drinks. \n\nWe ordered off the menu. I started with the amazing Pumpkin Bisque soup. It was spicy and peppery and lusciously smooth and creamy. It was sprinkled with cinnamon which also provided a wonderful aroma to the dish.\n\nFor my main course, I had salmon over risotto with a dill caper pan sauce. It was perfection on a plate. The Salmon was moist and flaky with a clean mild taste (really fresh). The risotto was just the way I like it - smooth and tender and rich. There was a side of broccolini with a nice touch of crunch, butter and garlic. \n\nWe passed on dessert as we were quite full. \n\nKen, the owner, took some time to visit with us. We felt like royalty. Our waitress was amazing and made sure that every part of our meal was to our liking. \n\nI am looking forward to returning and trying some of their other amazing offerings.

When this dish arrived at our table, we couldn't wait to dive in. We dove in and the dish was gone in no time, I highly recommend this as an appetizer.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the shrimp Monserrate. this dish comes with a generous amount of shrimp in a garlic butter sauce. The meal comes with 2 sides, I chose the rice with pigeon peas and sweet plantains. I loved my meal, I found it to be very tasty and thought it was a great value.\n\nMy wife had the breaded steak, she happen to order the same sides as me. She said the steak was good but mentioned the oil used to fry the breading was either too hot or possibly needed to be changed. Otherwise, she found the dish and sides to be very good.\n\nIf we are in the area again we would definitely stop back in.",

  "text": "I consider myself to be a lover of all things brunch related and after hearing about the brunch buffet at Lana's, I couldn't have been more excited to try it out. I was expecting to be rolled out of there full and satisfied, too bad we left extremely underwhelmed and still hungry. Appearance alone, everything looked pre-packaged and picked over. As we walked down the buffet line, the options became less and less appetizing and most disappointingly everything -even the COFFEE, was cold. Soggy, flavorless \"wild berry\" waffles and nauseating sweet onion chicken were the stars of the show. Having to ask for everything from a spoon and sugar AND cream, to more napkins, to a new cup of coffee 15 minutes later after they'd promised to replace the old one, was annoying to say the least. To top it off, one of the 6 waiters we had dropped our card/receipt off at another table. Was expecting more from this place, considering it was Easter Sunday and they weren't packed. Should've taken that as a sign in itself. But if you like underwhelming, store bought, bland flavors, cold and picked over, definitely recommend.",

  "text": "I don't give out 5 stars normally but I really did not have anything to complain about this restaurant. I think you have to know what you want to order and go beyond the standard menu choices. It helps that I am Chinese-American and grew up in a Chinese restaurant family. My rule of thumb is, don't order what you would normally order at a Chinese take-out place. \n\nWe made a reservation for Chinese New Year which was a smart idea since it was packed when we got there! We usually go to the original Yummy House location on Waters but we wanted to make sure we got a table so we decided to go with this location which is fancier and more modern than the original. \n\nEven though it was new years, luckily we got seated really quick (due to aforementioned reservation). We originally were going to have 5 people so they gave us a huge table meant for 8. But 1 person couldn't make it so we moved to a table for 4 but it would have been too small for all our food so we finally got a round table meant for 6 which was roomy enough for all of our dishes. \n\nThe server was running around a little hectically but we got our drinks and orders in. I wish she would have slowed down a little bit though because she would run off right after we make one order. Overall service was good though. \n\nWe started off with a order of their famous Salt & Pepper Calamari (must order!). Guaranteed, this dish is on almost every table in the restaurant! The spices and seasoning is so flavorful that I eat the extra seasoning with my rice! We also ordered pot stickers since that was the only dumpling dish on the menu. I got it purely for good luck for new years. Nothing special- just standard pot stickers with sauce. We also ordered their Salt & Pepper chicken wings which has the same seasoning as the calamari. The wings were extra crispy and had a hint of sweetness like maybe there was sugar caramelized on them. \n\nEntrees: Hong Kong style pan fried noodles- the best I've had in Tampa! The noodles were perfectly crispy and kept their texture even with the sauce and toppings. There was a lot of meat (chicken, roast pork) and seafood (calamari, shrimp, scallops), and vegetables (bok choy, mushrooms, carrots) . My Hong Kong mother would approve!\n\nHoney walnut shrimp- this dish was done very well. The sauce was sweet and savory and the walnuts were good enough to eat by themselves. The shrimp was served on top of a bed of greens. Not too sticky of a sauce that some places make. Sometimes this dish can be a little too rich but their version was just right. We ate this dish up real quick. \n\nMandarin Pork Chops- good sized pieces of pork chop in a red, sweet and sour-ish sticky sauce with onions. Standard but always good.\n\nSteamed Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce- the broccoli pieces were huge! Although I did think it was a little expensive ($9.95) for greens. The server actually brought out the wrong dish (Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce) at first but quickly realized the mistake. We might actually get the garlic sauce version next time since it looked good!\n\nHouse Fried Rice- this is not your average fried rice! It had a nice smoky-bbq flavor and it was really well balanced. I love fried rice and this was one of the better ones I've had. \n\nOverall: food was exceptional and authentic (for Tampa anyways). The portion sizes are generous. We ended up with 3 boxes of food to take home for the 4 of us. Prices were decent. Total for everything (8 dishes and 4 teas) was under $90.  Service was good. Ambiance and cleanliness was one point. Parking wasn't hard to find. It was a very nice evening. The owners of the Yummy House empire has done a nice job with this more upscale version. While I still personally prefer the old school Yummy House on waters, I can see myself coming here when I want a nicer atmosphere. I would take my mom here (and that means a lot since she is really picky when it comes to Chinese food).",

I will say, however, bring a jacket. In the winter time, the main hall gets freezing and there are no heaters to be found! On the bright side, they have great food trucks posted outside that pair perfectly with your beer! I love the fact that the air hockey was free and holy nostalgia! they have the Simpsons arcade game!

  "text": "As we drove up to this establishment, my first thought was to just keep on truckin'.  The curb appeal was less then appealing and the surroundings were as exciting as a dirty old strip mall can be.  Regardless, my wife said we should go for it.  I don't know if the owners like this description, but Kenner Seafood is the quintessential \"hole in the wall\" joint.  Awesome food, friendly service, and affordable prices.  'Nuff said, but I'll keep going....  \n\nWe loved it from the second we walked in.  We were first met by what appeared to be a small seafood market.  The restaurant and bar were just visible in the back.  This place was busy with the lunch rush, but we were lucky enough to find a decent sized booth.  So down we sat, the wife, baby and me.  \n\nFirst and foremost, they have diet root beer here.  Oh yea, it's one of my favorites (next to real beer of course).  I started off with a half dozen chargrilled oysters.  I found them to be perfect in every way.  Size, seasoning and flavor.  These beat Dragos hands down.  \n\nMy wife and I decided to go the traditional route for lunch.  I went with the 9\" fried shrimp po boy and she went with the fried catfish.  This is not to belittle their otherwise awesome menu.  They have an ample menu that I would love to pick through upon future visits, but my thoughts are if the can't make the most basic of NOLA fare, then they aren't worth another visit.  \n\nThe po boy was LOADED with fried shrimp that could've been considered a meal by themselves.  For $9, it was worth every penny.  The fried catfish was very good too, but my wife wasn't as jazzed about it as I was.  Great flavor, but not as crisp as she likes.  We finished off with their bread pudding.  Again, it was eye closing, lean back in your seat, delicious.  \n\nI'll be going back for sure.",

  "text": "This is my second time visiting the Gulch Nail Bar. The first time I just got a regular old plain nail polish manicure...it lasted about 1 day before I chipped them. This time around I went with a dip nail polish manicure, as I've heart people rave about them! We went with the Nail Bar because there was no wait, everywhere else in town that we called was PACKED full, and you needed a reservation...so it was definitely nice to just walk in and receive the services right away.\n\nThey turned out looking very nice, I was quite happy with the quality of them. On to the price of them, it was $50 for just the manicure part (no massage fluff stuff), an extra $5 if you need a removal process before hand, and then of course tip. It's a bit steep in my opinion, but I also don't regularly get my nails done so I'm not sure of the comparison to other nail places.\n\nOn a customer service stand point, the nail technician was fairly nice, but the receptionist was a bit impatient with me when I was trying to pick out a color. If i'm going to spend $70+ on my nails...I want it to be a color that I love, soooo I need my time, lol. But overall, it was a pleasant business and I got a pretty long lasting manicure.",

  "text": "Repeat Guest - this Review Update is for my 6th & 7th Stays, in 2014\n\nA well-deserved 5 stars! I am a repeat guest at this hotel -- I stayed here numerous times in 2013 and 2014 for stays averaging 10 days each, and some as long as 2 weeks each. This curent review is for my last two stays, each in 2014. As always, I am giving this hotel 5 stars for these most recent stays.\n\nI love this hotel, and that is why I have kept returning here since my first stay in 2013. It is alwys my first choice for my stays in the French Quarter.\n\nAs I've related before in my earlier review, I find the staffers to be friendly, helpful and competent, the management to be very responsive and responsible, and willing and able to be held accountable (which is rare in business nowadays!), and I find the hotel property itself, including the lobby, the elevators and stairwells, the hallways on each floor, and the rooms, and bathrooms, to be extremely good for a hotel in the Quarter in this price range.\n\nBetter yet, each of the rooms in which I have stayed across my multiple stays has been very large and spacious, and I have found all parts of the property to be very well-maintained and clean, and yet the property still bears a very large degree of Old World comfort, charm and ambiance, which I enjoy very much.\n\nBTW, the WiFi, which is free, seems to work great in all parts of the hotel; I have never had any WiFi problems at all across my stays in numerous different rooms loacated across the span of the hotel property, and the bandwidth and speed are also very good.\n\nI also find the housekeeping staff to be very cooperative and helpful, and respectful. I prefer a very green approach to all of my hotel stays, and thus I do NOT want my room cleaned every day, nor do I want my bedsheets and bathroom towels changed every day, for I find such practices to be very wasteful. I also have no need for someone to make my bed (i.e., tidy my bedsheets). Thus, for each of my 7 stays so far at this hotel I have advised the front desk and housekeeping of my preferences, and I have asked for no daily visits to the room by the housekeeper, and I assure them that if and when I DO want a housekeeper to visit my room (and even then, primarily to empty the trash cans), then I will, when such a day arrives, remove the DO NOT DISTURB sign from the outer doorknob on my room. So far, to date, the housekeeping staff has honored this request/agreement religiously, and NOT ONCE has a housekeeping staffer ever knocked on my door in violation of the DO NOT DISTURB sign. I am quite impressed with this almost fanatical ability to respect my request for near-zero housekeeping visits!\n\nI normally NEVER mention the names of particular staffers in my reviews of hotels, restaurants and pubs, but I am about to make an exception, one which I also made when I wrote a review for this hotel last year, wherein I wish to again mention two staffers in particular (although ALL of the staffers here have earned my undying appreciation):\n\nThe first staffer whom I wish to mention is Todd Theriot, the Guest Services Manager, whom I have contacted (sometimes by phone, usually via email) prior to each of my earlier stays to ask for an early check-in and a refrigerator in my room, and also for other favors at times (e.g., to stitch together into one contiguous stay in the same room three separate contiguous reservations), and he has always been very helpful and he and his staff have always come through flawlessly in terms of fulfilling those requests. I am amazed at his helpfulness, and that of his staff.\n\nThe second staffer whom I wish to mention is Robert, who is a bellman/doorman at this property (he has been working at this property for a great many years). He is unfailingly cheerful, helpful and gracious, and manages to greet me every time that I enter or leave the hotel during his shift. And, he is very helpful and generous in other ways: I normally eat very healthfully, but during a late 2013 stay here, I developed a craving for jelly donuts (I get such a craving about twice a year. ....), and I had happened to mention to Robert that I was unable to find jelly donuts anywhere in or near the French Quarter. Well, the next morning, as I returned from my early-AM walk, Robert stopped me and handed me a bag containing jelly donuts -- he had stopped at a well-known donut shop in another part of the city on his way to work, just to buy me the jelly donuts that I had been craving, which he presented to me as a gift! I was quite awed by this gesture, and very grateful! He has since done this for me, each time entirely unsolicited, during each of my 2014 stays as well.\n\nBefore ending this review, I wish to extend my sincere and heartfelt thanks to all of the staff and management at this hotel for all their fine efforts and care during all of my past stays (there were 7 or 8 of them)! Thank you!",

  "text": "*Please note, I was sampling root alcohol when I was inside of here.And that alone is capable of construing and greatly affecting my feeling for this place. especially when there's a DJ spinning good music in the background, and an art wall to go along with the theme of the booze.*\n\nBut with the above thrown into consideration, hot damn is this place awesome. I've been checking it out since around the time of it's beginning. But it took me a while to find it on here just because of the fact that I affectionately call it Compass just because of what it logo and sign remind me of (I guess I'm a dork too - http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/WI/223/1538/PreviewComp/SuperStock_1538R-47673.jpg).\n\nOverall the store is an interesting treasure trove to walk through. It's filled to the brim with interesting books, cool shoes, soap. nice looking bags, addicting T Shirts, and other cool trends of fashion. But to be honest the main flaw to a lot of the items on the whole can be the price tag. While I love and am sold on the idea of owning a Chewbacca and Moustache Logo T Shirt, I'm not necessarily sold on the idea of owning them for $34 a shirt. And that's just the basics.\n\nBut at least that price tag does go to a valuable message statement. And here's only part of it -\n\n\"Our story begins in Philadelphia, a city of Brotherly Love, do-it-yourself initiatives, and collectives of inspired artmakers. Since 2006, Art In The Age of Mechanical Reproduction has existed as a vehicle through which modern thinkers marry reverence for enlightened ideals with the mandate to reach more minds in an ever-fickle urban scene. Our community of free thinkers and artistic innovators delivers inspiration and aspiration back to The People.\"\n\nAnd that's the exact idea that runs rampant inside of it. It gives local artists a shot and supports free thought on every given occasion. And it does it ten fold during First Friday since it's in Old City. You'll enjoy a fine beverage such as root alcohol and check out a DJ just like I did. And there's worthy theme of art or history (or both on the wall), and plenty of interesting fashion to take in. And it is Idea's like all of the above that are worth supporting in the long haul.",

  "text": "I hate to do this, but it has to happen. We still come to the deli every few weeks for lunch meat, and the store is now pretty well stocked with local goodies. The products continue to be great. The lunch meat prices are great, and the other goods range from moderate to pricey. We still haven't had sandwiches, but we've earned a free one with our Flock card so I'm sure we'll cash in soon.\n\nThe reason that I have to drop a star is the service :( Efficiency and urgency are sorely lacking. The last two times I've been in, I've timed how long it takes to cut the meat, and it's been 13 minutes and over 20 minutes. I just don't have that much time to dedicate to lunch meat, and I could get Boar's Head so much more quickly from the grocery store. In the spirit of the family business, some of the kids are employees, but I struggle with this, too. I think the kids are perfectly nice and normal for their ages, but I'm not sure that having them behind the counter is the best choice in terms of professionalism. I'll leave it at that.\n\nWe'll still make regular trips (a 3 star review is A-OK, after all), but I would love to see things improve in the customer service department. This isn't enough to keep me away, but it might be for some people.",

I'm happy to get up and get my shopping done, and the excellent customer service is a nice compliment to my morning crankiness.  However, seriously work on the parking issue!  Sure you're paying a bit more for some items but I will gladly fork over more funds for quality food.  So if you are new to TJs, remember: shop at odd times, be prepared to vulture for parking, and you will pay more than kroger.  However, the experience is totally worth it.",

  "text": "We were looking to eat brunch and all the places we chose were either closed on Sunday or stopped serving food before we got there. We came across this place by accident because we got tired of searching and I love oysters, so we gave it a go.\n\nTo cut the the chase, it's just okay. For a city known for its food and drinks, the bar is pretty high when it comes to expectations and I can't say I was very impressed with the oysters and cocktails. I did appreciate that they had happy hour specials and the saints game playing though. \n\nI got the oyster trio (a three oyster sampler of their Rockefeller, Cajun and charbroiled oyster). I got it as a happy hour special to taste them and see which one I wanted to order a dozen of. I decided against it because they just weren't that good. All 3 were very watery and rubbery and just....okay. \n\nThe crab cakes, red beans and rice and the gumbo were delicious. The crab cakes were so good that we kept ordering them. Definitely try them if you go! \n\nMy Pimms cup cocktail was good but not anything is order again, just a bit too much cucumber for my liking. The hurricane was decent as well, but they went a little too heavy on the grapefruit juice (at least that's what it tasted like). \n\nOverall, I think it was pretty decent but not a strong contender in a city full of amazing food.",

  "text": "WB Pizza \n\nA friend told me the WB Pizza offered a ton of vegan options! \n\nLocated close to the broad ripple area, I finically had a chance to try their pizza. \n\nFrom the outside you may be a little skeptical in which it is located in a small strip mall near a liquor store and not much else. \n\nWB pizza is a local business and has been around for a good amount of time, since 1999. It's always great to support locally run businesses. It is a small restaurant, but has plenty of tables to accommodate big groups if needed. \n\nTheir menu has so many options, including vegan cheese and newly added vegan \"meats\". They also have a large selection of beer for all of the beer lovers out there. \n\nWe ordered the breadsticks with some of their garlic butter which is vegan and cheese (non vegan) for the others at the table. \n\nThe breadsticks were to die for. Honestly they were my favorite, even compared to the pizza. They were warm, small in size, with a slight crisp, and baked just right. \n(See pictured below).\n\nThe pizza we had was \"the vegan\" with no cheese. However they do offer vegan cheese for an upcharge. We also ordered another speciality pizza that had meat and cheese, which I can't speak of since I don't eat those things. \n\nI was impressed with the pizza and the amount of veggies on top but I wish the actual base of the pizza would have been cooked more because it was a very flimsy pizza. I would have preferred a little more spice of some sort. I liked the taste, but was disappointed when the check came out...\n\nTwo pizzas (12'') and breadsticks, a piece of vegan chocolate cake for almost 80 dollars, not including a tip. Now that is ridiculous!! \n\nI do have to admit that the vegan chocolate cake really made up for the cost because the cake was AMAZING! I mean it too! It was moist, light, and the frosting was delicious. This came close to being my favorite over the breadsticks. \n\nThe trick is to make your own pizza and add few toppings that you want because the speciality pizzas DON'T state their price on the menu and have a lot of toppings on them which are totaled to the same price as a custom pizza. I get that the ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade, but pizza ingredients aren't that expensive and I know this because I have made my own many times at home. \n\nIf you want to support a local business and want fresh cooked pizza at a high price, visit WB Pizza. \n\nI am unsure if I will return due to the shock I was in with the cost of the pizza mainly due to the fact that the menu is very misleading. I would definitely return for vegan desserts and breadsticks though!!!",

The weird newly upholstered floral booths are taking a stab at \"family resturaunt\", the bar and selection says \"dive,\" the constant Sinatra soundtrack the night I was in, and the older female bartender wearing two different earrings (one a pearl, one a long, dangly feather) scream South Philly, and my wine was skunked. \n\nI'm all about different types, different strokes for different folks, but for the love of God, decide what you are and do it right.

That's not me, and that's okay because Planet Fitness has members of all shapes and sizes and fitness levels. My favorite part is that there isn't that weird, musky gym smell. The place is clean, and super organized. There's tons of thread mills, and ellipticals, and strange machines I have no idea how to use. Not to mention tanning booths. \n\nI joined while they had their promo going which only cost me $1 to join and the monthly fee is $10. If you're home visiting from college or are even here for a couple weeks it's totally worth joining since it's considerably cheaper than most gym's guest passes. If you live you're life on a crazy schedule, this place is for you. It's open 24/7 Monday-Friday and has decent hours on the weekends. \n\nThere's a strict no grunting policy which I love. I just don't understand how grunting \"rawwrwww\" or \"uuuhhhhg\" will help anyone lift more weight but what do I know, I hate going to the gym! The best part is the lunk alarm. Every so often someone drops a weight which in itself can be embarrassing. At Planet Fitness an alarm sounds. So if you find yourself dropping a weight, just take a bow because you'll have a whole audience gawking at you.",

But I can tell you that as soon as you step out of your parked car you can smell the amazing food. Once you enter it's easy to forget you are connected to a gas station. The decor is beautiful. The dining space itself is a little small so make sure you get there early or else you WILL end up in a line outside the door. The buffet has plenty of options for the meat eater, the vegetarian, and the vegan alike. The lunch buffet also includes 2 dessert options and a section where fresh bread is being prepared and given to each table. The staff were friendly and attentive to our needs. Food in the buffet was constantly being replenished. This place is a must try for Indian food lovers and we will definitely be returning.",

The brisket was slightly dry but when I added the housemade chipotle BBQ sauce it tasted good! The half chicken fell off the bone and went really well with the house made honey BBQ sauce. The ribs had nice flavor to them and also fell of the bone. For the sides I had mac and cheese which was good but not my preference for mac n cheese. I just prefer baked mac and cheese but I know other people like a more saucy mac. I loved Butcher's collard greens because I make mine pretty damn close to how they make theirs. They're clearly cooked in pork of some sort (a must), have a little kick and a hint of vinegar. They cook theirs down more (which is a total preference thing) but had a great balance of flavor. Butcher's sauces definetly have more vinegar in them so if you like Carolina BBQ...this place is for you. \n\nOur service was great and the staff was so friendly! Took the time to answer any question. In terms of the price and quantity of food, you can't beat it! Split the 3 meat and 2 sides platter with one other person and we still had so much leftover.

  "text": "Being a beer geek, I needed to find at least one brewery while in Florida.  The problem is, I had heard very little that was positive about Florida's micro brews.  I found a good one here though!\n\nThe atmosphere is typical of a good brewery.  \n-Their tanks, which come from the Bass brewery, are visible to the whole restaurant.  \n-There is an old world feel inside.  \n-The outside of the building is complete with their beer logos.\n-Their Great American Beer Festival medals are visible behind the bar.  -The pictures on the wall show some local history and are fun to peruse while you wait. \n-I love the dart area!  I think breweries need to have non-electronic dart boards.  This one even was decorated with grain bags that completed the brewery feel - almost like you were actually in the work area.  \n-The patio was wonderful!  It looks over an old neighborhood (at least I think by the looks of it).  Being from Minnesota, I really enjoyed the misting fans they had located on the patio.  It cooled down a HOT July evening!\n\nWe started out with a beer sampler, that came complete with 8 of their 10 beers (the others were currently out) and their root beer and cherry cream soda.  The root beer was one of the best I have ever tasted!  Their Old Elephant Foot IPA had good hop flavor at 80 ibu's and was easy to drink.  The Iron Rat Stout was awesome!  It was hoppy and had the right bite to accompany the dark, smooth deliciousness.  The Wild Warthog Weizen was good as well.  Just the right banana flavor, but not overwhelming (good patio beer).  One Night Stand Pale Ale is a hoppy, yet light (yellow) American Pale Ale.  It was great for the hot Tampa weather - light without sacrificing the great flavor of hops!  Unfortunately they were out of the Red Eye which seems to be the most popular beer there.\n\nOn to food.  We had a delicious pizza that came complete with 4 cheeses and a HOP pesto!!!!!  Great flavor, and even left that hop bitterness on your palate after you were finished.  We had bread pudding for desert.  It was good, but not like the midwest.  The highlight of this desert was the porter-soaked raisins!\n\nService was great!  Our server was busy, but never hesitated to help.  He even filled root beer growlers for us before we left.  I forgot his name now, but props to you awesome Tampa Bay Brewing Company guy!\n\nUnfortunately, they were out of the T-shirt I wanted to take home, and the silly Florida liquor laws don't allow them to sell beer in a growler.  However, this is not their fault.\n\nGreat place to stop if you need good beer in Tampa!  I will be back if I am ever in Tampa again!",

Nice hop smell and bitterness coming through from the hops.  \n\nSours - I am new to them but try their sampler 9$ for any 4 - good pours allow you to taste multiple.  I loved the sour orange peel - definite pucker and great orange tangy taste. \n\nMilk stout. -  Mmm their peanut butter ms was great - awesome taste, also enjoyed the coffee stout which had balanced coffee nose and taste.  \n\nAtmosphere is great - big fans keep it feeling cool, lots of games, a few TVs, good music in background.   They have a lounge attached to main bar with tables and a few couches.  Believe it or not wifey and I come here to study and the background noise (and beers) help us focus :)\n\nThe staff is very good - friendly, lots of beer knowledge and always a smile. \n\nThey have an outside area out back you can bring dogs to and do have movies playing out back on a big screen on certain nights.  Pizza, wings served inside but we have not tried those yet.  Tours avail - check group on for deals.  \n\nAll in all this is worth the drive to spend a few hours at tailgate !!!!",

  "text": "I had been to Fette Sau for drinks before, but decided to get a full meal here on Valentine's weekend. My logic was that you should only eat messy BBQ with someone who really loves you, right? We got nearly a pound of smoked brisket with mac and cheese and delicious baked beans. A side of soft biscuits was tossed in, and there were several different pre-made sauces on each table. The meat was really great, and the sides were soo savory, heavy, and just what you would expect from a place like this.\n\nMy recommendation is to get a little bit less food than you think you need, because it is going to be very filling. They also have happy hour food specials - a great deal if you want something on the small side.\n\nAgain, the place is super casual, but a great spot to go to with friends. The picnic table seating and good beer selection are a perfect setting for a night out. The entrance to Fette Sau is especially beautiful - as it looks like you are walking into the front door of someone's country home.",

  "text": "Frankie's on Fairview, sometimes I just want to scream with frustration over you.  How do I rank \"almost\"?  Seriously, this is making me crazy.\n\nDinner started a few months ago, and since then the Reverend, I and sometimes others have visited three evenings.  Since it's a new offering, I wanted to give time for the restaurant to settle and even out.  Except it hasn't.\n\nFirst visit:  Gnocchi and the milanese pork chop.  Gnocchi was definitely freshly made and had a nice texture.  Pork chop was great....except no applesauce which is the Reverend's favorite pork chop topping.  The gnocchi were swimming in an orange-ish sauce and rooted in a bed of melted cheese.  The sauce was...odd.  Was it a vodka rose, perhaps?  No, marinara we were told.  Marinara is red and robust, not orange and...odd.  Service was great.\n\nSecond visit:  Went with the chicken parmesan and again, the Rev wanted the pork chop. This time he had grieved the loss of applesauce and moved on. Both entrees were solid.  Yay! No weird orange sauce. Perhaps it was just an off night.  I ordered the wedge salad with my meal. It promised lots of Maytag bleu cheese.  What came out was...odd. There was a huge slice of iceberg, bacon crumbles, tomato, and crumbles of bleu cheese. No dressing.  The problem is that the iceberg (lack of? bland?) flavor overcame everything else, so it tasted just like eating plain lettuce.  Again, service was great, and this time they took my salad back, added some mayonnaise to the bleu cheese to form a basic dressing. Good save.  With that base added the bleu cheese flavor came through beautifully.  \n\nThird visit: Calamari, bacon mac & cheese, herbed chicken breasts, guess who got the pork chop (he is a man who knows what he likes) and lastly the linguine bolognese.  Calamari had a berry glaze drizzled on it which was ...odd.  Bacon mac & cheese was fine, it was a small ramekin as it's an appetizer.  Chicken earned rave reviews, tender, flavorful.   Pork chop again was consistently very good.  \n\nNow for the linguine.  Everyone, please repeat after me:\n\n\"Sauce with meat is not the same as Bolognese\".  \n\nThank you.  Also, the return of the strange orange sauce, this time with meat and carrots, which made the orange multi-dimensional.   \n\nThis time service was WAY off. Clearly no front of house management or line management.  No, they were not busy, there were 4 total tables and 2 servers.  Meals took a very long time to come out. First time we asked, we were told they were coming. Second time we asked, we were told the pork chops took longer to cook.  Wait staff: Never blame the food ordered for the delay.  Then our waiter disappeared.  Our glasses became empty. Bread was gone. Tummies growled.  Hurrah! Food arrives.  Drinks are refilled! We are back in the land of the living!  Except, no.  After that we were left to our own devices.  *sigh* Finally we were checked in on, got to-go boxes for what we didn't eat.  \n\nMade the mistake of ordering a dessert, because hey, how long could that take to come out?  I can tell you: 12.5 very long minutes with dirty dishes covering our table.  No sign of our waiter.  When dessert did come out, it came with the check, which never got picked up.  Seriously.  Oh, and the dirty dishes weren't cleared when dessert arrived, so we had to stack it and eat around them.  Finally we went up and handed a random person our check with payment. We were asked how it was.  We replied \"very long and we sat with dirty dishes for a good part of that\".  \"Sorry!\"  Yah.  $100 check and \"Sorry!\" Hm.\n\nSee here's the thing: Some things they do very well. Pork chop is consistently solid,even without the applesauce.  Chicken dishes were great. Then there is the stuff that is just ... odd.  Some I get are creative choices, but then there's orange marinara and salad without dressing.  The thing is: It's not a cheap meal. They're clearly shooting for a higher end experience. They just don't execute well often enough to give us pause. We MAY be back for dinner.  It's definitely not top-of-list anymore, though. \n\nBreakfast, by the way, still rocks the house.  Very good, and usually well managed service.  \n\nFrankie's, we want to love you, really.  We are going to have to settle though for just \"A-OK\".  We like you, we just think you're a little odd and off.",

My usual go tos are the cafe mocha or the cappuccino while my husband usually gets an espresso. I knew I liked this place, but after being in Paris for a week and falling in love with the cafe lifestyle, the last drop had a whole new meaning for me. While it's definitely not a Parisian cafe, they have a few seats outside where I tend to sit when I bring my dog for the walk over, and have yummy croissants, bagels and sandwiches if you're looking for more than just coffee. As another reviewer noted, the baristas are not as friendly as say, Starbucks, but I'd rather not have someone in my face while I'm waiting for my coffee to be made. I'll probably be back this Saturday for a cafe mocha...",

We started with a hurricane each and crawfish hush puppies. These guys were FILLED with crawfish. Just wish the order was larger! My sister, who isn't crazy about oysters, ordered a half dozen of the chargrilled oysters just because of the reviews she had heard about them. Turned out they were her favorite meal of our whole vacation. She loved these! She also had the soup of the day - corn and shrimp bisque. She said it was good but not great. My mom got the crab cake platter - lots of crab with little filler. My dad got a combo with grilled sausage, sausage gumbo, jambalaya and red beans and rice. He enjoyed everything but his favorite was the grilled sausage! For me, the seafood gumbo. It was delicious. Great flavor without being overly salty and had huge chunks of seafood. \n\nThe only reason it's not 5 stars - the drink prices. My hurricane was more than my entree! It's not that the Hurricanes were necessarily expensive at $7 but that price is not in proportion with the food prices.",

I should have known better than to order anything but steak at a steakhouse. The pan fried catfish was good but had too much going on for my taste. I would have preferred it alone and the toppings on the side. I did have some of my brother's Prime Rib cooked medium well and it was delicious- tender and juicy. The Brenden Bread Pudding was absolutely delicious especially if you love pecans. \n\nOur server Anthony was friendly and attended to our table as needed. We ended dinner with singing Happy Birthday and indulging in her custom made Blue Dog birthday cake. The chef was gracious enough to slice the cake as many of us were full and took it to go. \n\nOverall for the price I have had better food but it was a good experience to try at least once. \n\nSupport local business!

This is some real back in time stuff here.  \n\nA la carte or platter prices are listed up on the old school Coca Cola menu board. Polish specialties are served cafeteria style from warming trays, but not by stereotypical lunch ladies by any means; beautiful stylish Polish ladies have been behind the counter at our every visit. There lies the only real evidence that we're not grubbin in '77 or so...\n\nMaybe prices have gone up a bit since the 70's, but damn do we get a tray full of good eatin' for the both of us together for under fifteen dollas. I'm sayin, we have made animals outta ourselves splitting: the golabki, kielbasy, bigos, mashed beets, an order of pierogi, and two drinks...all for fourteen seventy somethin? Good deally.\n\nIf you want your order of pierogi fried (they're cooked after you order), you'll have to order them that way with onions and sour cream, if you wannem. I forgot to order them fried, so I was initially a little disappointed when I realized my omission and the potato and cheese dumplings were served only boiled and buttery, but when getting down to eating them, I didn't really miss the crisp.  In this state they went so well with the buttery, sweet and earthy mashed beets. I'm repeating the word, \"buttery,\" cause there's a lot of this happenin here. We've repeatedly ordered that buttery buttery combo again. \n\nThe porky sauerkrauty hunter's stew that is bigos was pretty good, not my most favorite bigos ever, but obviously went well with the kielbasy, it did. Definitely dug the giant golabki- tender cabbage leaves stuffed with rice and beef... tasty, tasty stuff in tangy tomato sauce. I loves golabki, and that's a good one. \n\nOn subsequent visits we've enjoyed mushroom soup and some potato pancakes (tasty but greasy), too. \n\nAll in all, I'd say that Syrenka's is A-OK all the way: Tasty, hearty food for good prices is the key. I dig this time capsule of a Polish cafeteria. \nButt-buuh-butttery time capsule, time capsule!",

I regret not stopping sooner. \n\nFor a recent dinner we had a lengua taco (not bad), a shrimp taco (delicious sauce and homemade slaw), a pork belly taco (not bad, but it was tender cubes of pork. I  was expecting a slab.) and I simply had to try the pork rind taco (yum!).\n\nMy companion had the asada burrito and loved it. The sauce, cheese, rice, and perfectly marinated steak combined with the homemade tortilla was a winner.\n\nWe will be going back without a doubt.",

  "text": "Soho Juice has the best acai bowls I've ever had. I live in a bigger city than St. Pete and thought I'd find a better place there, but I haven't. So I make sure to stop by Soho Juice when I'm in St. Pete. \n\nI think the Cloud 9 bowl is particularly good and unique, although I have enjoyed all the ones I've tried. You may think the price is a little high for the large size, but it's a large serving, you can eat half and put the rest in the freezer for another time. \n\nI'm glad they also serve toast to provide a little variety. Also love that it's easy to get vegan food here!",

I have been several times and loved everything I purchased. I even had them add some patches to one slick denim vest I got as a gift (that also purchased here) and they did a great job at a fair price. \n\nIt is a cool shop to wonder through even if not buying right away. I have also seen one of the owners, Beau, offering plenty of good local advice on places to go and eat to interested visitors. Great business and SB ambassadors!! We will be back for sure.",

The menu is simple and straight to the point. I love the fact that even though it seems like the menu has few items, the number of yummy Gluten Free options in which I can chose from. This Chipotle also has three adult beverages, beer, patron, and some sort of margarita. \n\nAll and all, the staff was friendly, the food was good, and I can eat here.

  "text": "I have a problem.\n\nI have been thinking about the vegetable samosas from Desi Chaat House a lot.  It is causing a serious interruption in my daily functioning.\n\nSometimes I will be in the middle of a conversation and I will pretend to get a call so that I can go outside, hail a cab, and go to Desi Chaat house for the samosas.  I return, sometimes an hour later, and attempt to continue the conversation as if nothing had happened.  My friends think I'm on drugs and my girlfriend is accusing me of having an affair but they don't know how much I love these samosas.\n\nBut Brad, why not introduce these people to Desi Chaat house?  \n\nThe answer is simple, hypothetical question-asker...it is because I am a man who's mind is rife with delusional paranoia.  I fear that my friends and loved ones, knowing my weakness, will buy out the samosas before I am able to get to the restaurant and they will sell them to me at ridiculous markups.  Like a hopeless addict, I will be enslaved to the wills of those I once trusted. \n\nIllogical? yes.  Impossible?  Nope.\n\n...ok back to reviewing.\n\nWhen you order them, they will offer to pour chickpeas over them.  Let them do this.  \n\nThe best way I could describe the chaat is...wacky.  It is a peculiar mix of sweet, spicy, creamy, and aromatics.  I've had the vegetable samosa and mumbai chaat and both are good.\n\nThe chicken roll and lamb roll make an excellent lunch.  The meat is tender and seasoned extremely well.  I highly recommend these items.  For a very vegetarian-leaning culture, India sure makes some excellent meat dishes.\n\nOn top of it all, the staff is ridiculously friendly and always asking for feedback on how they can improve.  It is tasty, inexpensive, unique, and has the best veggie samosas in Philadelphia.\n\nNote: I like veggie samosas a lot more than most people so bear that in mind when you consider this review.",

  "text": "Folks, how many of you are tired of the same mass-produced sausages and deli meats from the big supermarkets? \n\nI was searching for an authentic alternative to the fake-smoked selections of sausages I normally have to settle for, and found this small gold mine in Berry Hill that's tucked back in a little plaza on Thompson Lane across from Guitar Center. This place is really small, but the unique selections of ethnic deli meats and sausages makes this place a monster of the midway!\n\nThe sausages at Aleksey's are genuinely smoked, and you'll find several European and Russian meat products to choose from. They take pride in their especially large deli selection, and I guarantee you won't find familiar name brand products in this meat case. I've had to ask what many of these meats are, and these folks are very friendly and willing to assist and educate you.\n\nToday I asked for salami and tried a recommended spicy selection, and it was outstanding! I would love to try one of everything just to educate my palette! They carry a nice selection of canned goods and other non-perishables that you would expect to find in international markets, and they do it in a pretty small space. I want to reiterate that it's the ethnic meat selection that's the star of the show!\n\nMarkets like this are what you would normally find in multinational communities like NYC, and we're very fortunate to have a place like Aleksey's in the Nashville area. Please stop by and give these folks the opportunity to introduce you to a whole new world of ethnic flavors!",

  "text": "\"You HAVE family in Santa Barbara that I don't know about?!\"\n\nMy husband was shocked. \n\nThat's how you keep it interesting and fresh! who says you stop discovering things about each other once you're married? ;-)\n\nTo be honest, I've been a bad cousin. No matter how many times we've gone down to SoCal, I've never really made it a point to connect with my long lost cousin. (it's been a decade!) \n\nFast forward to last weekend when he recommended Los Agaves. We arrived first with my parents and were welcomed with a very PACKED and noisy Saturday night atmosphere. It was self explanatory: fall in line, order at the counter, grab your utensils and sit yourself at a free table. We needed assistance since there were 6 of us.\n\nWe only waited a short while until they showed up and it was quite the reunion! We kept ourselves busy while waiting for our food, stuffing our faces with the fresh made chips and varieties of salsa. You're a spice wuss? good luck. Even the most \"mild\" salsa has a pretty good kick to it. I'm def a wuss (wah, wah) but the green avocado salsa was thick and had a nice flavor to it, that I couldn't stop at just one chip!\n\nSoon after, the real party came: massive steak burrito mojado ($10.95), several tacos del mar ($13.50) and grilled chicken fajitas ($16.25). I really loved the sweet mangoes that topped my fish tacos and that chipotle sauce worked its magic! All plates come with a nice heaping of Mexican rice and side salad. My mom and husband enjoyed their margaritas, but declared that the blood orange margarita had a better taste than the regular one. I was just jealous, since I couldn't partake because of lent :(\n\nLos Agaves gave us a pleasant experience and definitely lived up to its reputation as an upscale Mexican restaurant. I love the generous portions too! I'm curious to try one of their Molcajetes next time I'm in Santa Barbara and I wouldn't let another 10 years pass by before I see my cousin again.",

  "text": "Overall I really like this Whole Foods Market. It is not as large as some of their other stores, such as the amazing mega WFM in Oxnard, but also not as tiny as the store in Hillcrest for my SD friends out there. \n\nI love going to the Buzz Hive, an intimate bar with great beer and wine selections, food made to order and large TVs that play most of the popular sporting events. \n\nWhole Foods is one of my go to markets for vitamin & herbal supplements and natural, organic beauty products. For my curly-haired guys and gals, they carry the incomparable, Kinky Curly line of hair products that will make even the tightest and most unruly of curls look defined, soft and amazing. \n\nI also enjoy ordering fish from the Seafood Dept and having them prepare it for me on my lunch or dinner breaks. They have some wonderful seasoning options. I recommend Tilapia (Blackened) and Shrimp (Grilled w/ Garlic Butter), mmm! On Fridays, fresh Oysters are only a $1 per piece and they'll shuck them for you. I love to order a dozen and take them over to the Buzz Hive to enjoy with a glass of white wine. \n\nThe cheese shop is incredible. So many great frommages to choose from. Don't be shy about asking the staff for recommendations and/or samples. They are pros and generally are happy to oblige. Here's a pro tip: Look for the little basket in the cheese section for the ends and pieces of cheese. You can find some fabulous high end cheeses at perfect portions for one or two people that are very reasonably priced. I like to buy a few and take them on a picnic or to the Buzz Hive to enjoy with a big, bold red. \n\nI could go on and on but I don't want to spoil the fun of you discovering all the cool things about this location. \n\nWhy not four stars? Sometimes customer service can be a miss. There have been less than cordial staff at the juice bar and in the meat dept, who strangely I haven't seen working there in a while so perhaps the problem has resolved itself, who really put a damper on the shopping experience. Also, I have heard that Whole Foods has a stellar return policy, however, the one time that I sought to use it to seek an exchange and/or refund for being given an entirely different pizza than we ordered with an ingredient that I am allergic to (Hubs didn't check the inside of the box before he got home. We called and the pizza dept said to let the manager know the next time that we were there) - we did and the manager at the front desk refused to honor it. Bummer. We've never ordered pizza from WF since and that was over two years ago. \n\nOther than that, it's a great market and we shop there regularly. If anyone at corporate is reading, a second location on the Eastside would thrive! With customers coming from Montecito, the Riviera, Downtown, the Funk Zone and the Eastside - I think it would be a hit! Check out the space where Fresh Market used to be on Milpas Street.",

  "text": "I love trying out new spots.  I've been here twice, once for drinks, once for dinner.  There's a lot of good beer here, some with prices from reasonable to outrageous.  Still, the selection gives you options no matter what your goal is, from sipping at heavy stout to drinking cheap pounders.  I really liked that they give you a pint glass even when you order can beer.  \n\nThere is a nice, long wooden bar which is the best spot at The Blind Pig.  They have a few TVs, and this is a good place to catch the Phillies.  There's also outdoor seating, which is fantastic if the weather cooperates.  \n\nThe food menu is standard; average.  There is nothing that jumps out, although lots of people rave about the Thanksgiving balls: deep fried turkey and mash potatoes served with gravy.  \n\nThere was one special that I was intrigued by: Alligator sausage.  It was a 70-30 blend made with pork, and the meat was delicious and flavorful, like a more gamey chorizo.  It was served on a small white roll with a salad on the side.  The bread was terrible.  Is it too much to ask for Amaroso or Sarcone in Philadelphia?  The salad was okay; forgettable.  \n\nEmily ordered a beat salad and wasn't thrilled either.  The menu, overall, just seems to have little or no effort.  The service was ok, but not on par with other spots I usually visit.\n\nBottom Line: I like the can beer selection, even if some are overpriced.  The draft list offers good options, but the food is nothing special.  The Blind Pig needs to find it's niche to survive, because right now, there is not much going on.  Nothing bad either, but that's usually not enough.",

First of all, I can't believe it took me this long to discover it. Even though I've only eaten here twice, it was twice in one day, so take that for what it's worth. \n\nTo say the menu is extensive is an understatement - everyone in my party, both times I went, was able to find something to eat and enjoy (some after a great deal of debate), including a 10-year-old.  The bánh mì was exceedingly fresh; the sushi was excellent, hard to beat at its 2 for $10.95 price, and the presentation was lovely (try the Valentine roll to see what I mean).\n\nI did learn that I can't eat in regularly for lunch as the service is slow for lunch standards, but they do offer takeout. Subway is right next door, but with a sandwich like their bánh mì, I don't foresee any further need for Subway on my quick lunches.",

It's a bit small, but I've been back twice and lucked out with a barstool every time.\n\nWe started off with the whiskey flights, there's three options, we went with the Rickhouse and were quite satisfied. I've had the Village Burger, and it's a good burger, but it won't rewrite your universe. What might, are the duck-fat fries. I live in a different city also known for fantastic food, and as much as I've scoured, we do not have fries cooked in duck-fat. I should open a food truck and serve them, because they are amazing!\n\nFinally, there's a huge menu of whiskies. Try the Redbreast if you need a place to start. Any time I've ordered it, the bartender has always been impressed. \n\nNext time I'm in Philly, I'm definitely headed back to Village Whiskey.",

The mix of flavors in that wonderfully made soup keeps us coming back for more.  We also love their Ginger Beef; forget the rice (which you can order) we just want the beef.  The Deep Fried Squid is also awesome.  The best thing to do is oder many different items and share them with friends and family; the portions are pretty big and you'll have trouble finishing it off by yourself.  We even have trouble finishing off our soup bowls, which happen to be the size of our heads.  It's a great place to get together with the people you care about and catch up over lots of good food.  The menu is pretty big and that can be a little overwhelming only because everything sounds so good.  Curtis and I were waiting for our soup one day and we were looking at the take-out menu; listing off all the different dishes we haven't tried yet made us so hungry.  Oh and if you want to order any appetizers the spring rolls, green onion cakes and the deep fried shrimp rolls are super good.  If you want to come to La Pagode I suggest you not eat for days so that you can eat a lot of really good food when your at the restaurant, or come with a large party and try a bit of everyones food.",

It was our favorite spot from the time it first came to Cherry Hill until we broke up, about 6 years ago. Tried to go there with other people and recapture the magic... but it just wasn't there. (Could have been the company I was with... I don't know!) LOL Anyway, The place had fallen off CONSIDERABLY, and was mediocre at best.\n\nFast forward to 2010... well, my bf and I have reconciled. Decided to go back to the Silver Diner and see if things had improved any. Sadly, no. It's as if they just stopped caring. \n\nThey still have their Crabcake melts which are actually SCRUMPTIOUS. Their fries are pretty good, and I never had a bad coke there yet. I think the place just feels LAZY to me, like everyone in there is in need of a nap or is just waking from one. It's just a nonchalant, half-assed effort.. none of the energy of the first few years after it opened.\n\nGranted, it could be ME. My tastes have changed a lot over the years. I'll be fair and give them a 3. If you had asked me about 6 years ago, I would have said a 4 or possibly a 5.\n\nStill an ok place to go while  you're waiting for your movie to start at Loews.",

  "text": "Great deli, ordered the tongue special. Loaded with thin slices of tender tongue, slaw, cheese and thousand island dressing on rye bread. They offer either seeded or unseeded rye which is nice since I love rye but not caraway. I stopped by on a weekday at lunch time so was able to snag a spot in their shared lot and the line wasn't too bad. \n\nThey do carry a lot of cool and tasty specialty groceries. In the back they also  have a great selection of craft beers. Not the biggest selection but a very well thought out one.",

  "text": "Originally built in 1929, the restored historic Lovett Barn is now home to a trattoria that caters to homemade Italian cuisine. http://www.lastallarestaurant.com/menus/lastalla_dinner_menu.pdf\n\nThe pasta's and sauces are homemade, the prices are a little on the high side.  The dinner menu priced for two, can be split in half for one and add $3.00.  The clams casino are very good and seasoned perfectly with red pepper, onion and bacon.  \n\nThe Marsala dishes are exceptional, with your choice of chicken or veal.  They offer a large list of ways to have your chicken or veal, like Francese, parmigiano, saltimbocca and so on.\n\nThe choices of pasta entrees could drive you insane, you name it, they make it.  The choices for both lunch and dinner is a wide selection from the appetizers to the salads and the great variety of entrees.  The antipasto choices are more than most Italian restaurants offer.\n\nCheck them out at and while visiting their site, check out their calendar for discounts and half price bottle of wine nights.  They serve a Sunday buffet which is a great and tasty value.",

  "text": "We had an excellent experience at this location! \n\nI'm particularly found of the downtown location, so I never thought to look to see if there were other locations near me. Turns out, there is! This is a fairly new location, opened December of 14' I believe. \n\nSame menu as downtown with all your favs like The Shewman (Peanut butter on your burger? Yes. It's awesome.) I was a little crestfallen to see that the beer selection was, in my opinion, a little limited in brew house standards, but we each found a beer to love and pair with our burgers. \n\nThe restaurant itself was very clean. A decent sized parking lot is also a huge plus. It's a little tucked away behind some other businesses, so unless you knew it was there you might not see it. \n\nI'm grateful to have this gem on the Southside and look forward to meeting many a friends here!",

Nice little town. The inn overlooks the river which you can enjoy. Nice outside seating, live music outside. We didn't know they had outdoor seating so we sat in the tavern and ordered a late lunch. Everyone here was friendly and I honestly didn't expect the food to be as fresh and delicious as it was! We ordered the fish and chips - fish was tender and fresh, perfectly crusted and fried with no oily residue, the portobello mushroom sandwich - had hummus, goat cheese and baby arugula on ciabatta bread -delicious! And the BLT salad - I am a bacon lover and it has sufficient bacon sprinkled all over the edge salad, succulent blue cheese and a homemade blue cheese dressing. Enjoyed every bite annnd tried everyone else's order - we all enjoyed lunch and would definitely be back! Highly recommend!",

This is a hidden gem!\n\nI got ten wings (spicy teriyaki and spicy Italian), and a huge order of fried rice.  Everything was excellent.\n\nSomething I love about the wings is that they're meaty, but not too fatty.  Some wings places (Buffalo WW - I'm looking at you) have really fatty wings.  These are just right and perfectly cooked.  The sauces were a bit bland, so I'll try other flavors next time.\n\nThey also have cheesesteak sandwiches and egg rolls!  Lots more to try out, but I'll definitely be back for the wings.",

  "text": "I should state that I do try to buy local, a lot. I love Summit Hut. I also love REI. Both are different. Both offer me the things I need. I make huge purchases at SH and I also buy from REI. I love both. \n\nI am a co-op member of REI and like to purchase things especially with their very cool 20% off coupons and outlet store discounts. I've even attended some REI bike and GPS free. classes. I enjoy browsing REI even if I don't always buy because they have so many goodies. I am an avid outdoors person and the gadgets and trinkets they offer make me want to set up a survival camp in the wild and live off the land- REI can make that possible. They can also just get your water bottles for a day hike or nice clothing for anytime of the season. They have a bike repair service. And REI has an amazing return policy. \n\n\"REI = Return Everything Indeed.\" Well no, it doesn't mean that. But if you attend one of the REI yard sales they have, you'll see that they do take back everything and often can turn around and sell it. I bought an REI tent once, was unhappy with the condensation it produced (akin to a sweat bath) and they offered ideas to make it work until I just had it returned, full refund. \n\nI find the prices high but manageable if you have a coupon. And the co-op membership means a yearly dividend.. As my outdoor needs increase, I am so glad for so much outdoorsy shops in Tucson to help me with my passion.",

I've been here several more times now and it is actually very good. The bread is soft and a little crusty on the outside, the meat portions are nice, and the flavors are great. My only gripe is that you get charged extra for peppers, mushrooms, etc. Kind of a small issue really but it adds up quickly on your bill. They do have pepperoncinis and sweet peppers at the table though which I personally love. Service is always friendly and reasonably fast.",

And they even have the classic Le Bec Fin cheese cart which was a gift to them tfrom Chef Perrier! For us it delivered grand offerings like St. Angel, Scharfer Max, Selles Sur Cher, and Bonne Bouche. But between the extensive knowledge of both Michael and Alex, you're bound to be treated to something impressive.\n\nadd in a plentiful assortment of classic and new school cocktails, a solid selection of wines, and a solid list of bottled and draft beers that are noteworthy even if they are a touch overpriced, and you have a Rittenhouse Square hot spot that's worthy of a visit!",

  "text": "I recently discovered Halo Farms a few weeks back during one of our weekend trips on the way back from Hoagie Haven. My buddy, Joe was a long time fan telling me about the halo pub (Still haven't gone yet.) and noted it was on the way back- suffice to say we stopped by and I absolutely loaded up. Since my first, I've been back 2-3 times and have slowly made my way through most of their drink offerings, and a number of their pints as well.\n\nLet me start by saying, i absolutely love just about everything I've had from Halo, some things ive had better of, but some, there's no comparison- (Two words: Chocolate milk, if you've had better, you'd best DM me the details so i can go try some for myself- because my first experience with it was orgasmic- I was a blind man seeing for the first time.) But even the most \"meh\" drink, cant be argued with, fact of the matter is halo is damn good for what it is, and is ridiculously cheap, while also being far healthier putting equivalent offerings (Especially in its price bracket.)\n\nAs stated above, the chocolate milk is to die for, literally, the look on my face after we were driving away me tearing into it for the first time had Joe busting a gut, its a miracle we didn't crash- me sitting there like an 8 year old with a school carton just absorbing a quarter gallon of milk going \"JOSEPH WHY HAVE YOU BEEN HOLDING OUT ON ME\" its less than 2.50 per half gallon and is in earnest the best chocolate milk I've ever had.\n\nFor their normal milk, i opted for their 4% which was extremely creamy, a bit healthier than equivalent milk, but no life-changing experience- still good, and a decent price for what it is.\n\nTheir Apple Cider is better than their juice, and both are priced roughly the same, apple juice is still quite good, and packed with a decent amount of nutrition, great good cheap stuff as per usual.\n\nOrange juice was okay, same deal, nothing to write home about, but really decent, and cheap to boot.\n\nAides had some low points- Fruit punch is fantastic, orangeaide was quite good. Easyaide, which was also orange, was underwhelming- like a more watery version of the regular orange. Grape was middle of the road, okay but if def had better. and Lemonaide really depends on your preference, this is some hardcore fresh squeeze tasting stuff, very tart- perfect if your into that, me personally? Im a giant sourpuss when it comes to sweet vs tart- but its still quite good even if not my preference and i still finished it the day of.\n\nTheir iced tea is decent as well- and competitively priced the same as the aide's 89 cents, its very similar to icy tea, which is a little bit more expensive- couldn't say which I prefer.|\n\nThe Ice Creams were a weird experience for me, ive tried Butter Pecan, Cookies and Cream, Normal Vanilla (Which is really Bourbon), Taihetian Vanilla, Choco-Peanutbutter, and Peanutbutter (Vanilla + peanutbutter). I question myself saying this right now, but i honestly feel like the toppings or twists on these take away from the ice cream themselves, the original vanilla was the best of the bunch. Not a fan of the peanut butter used in both variants, rest was middling.\n\nAll in all Halo Farms is a fantastic cheap alternative for drink options, while also providing higher nutritional value compared to alternatives, the one downside of this is the lack of preservatives- meaning there's a lot more urgency in getting items to the fridge than usual.\n\nFlavor & Presentation 4.5/5   |   Service & Speed 4/5   |   Price & Proportion  5/5\n\nOverall 4.5/5",

Today I didn't and the only other brunch items were biscuits or waffles.  The Hummus appetizer caught my eye, partially because of the kalamata olives and I love hummus.  The hubby went for their Eggs Your Way with seasoned potatoes and an English muffin, for just $5!  \n\nOur service was great and the food came out fast.  The hubby's plate looked just like I expected, he enjoyed it.  Mine was a generous portion of fresh made hummus, so much better than anything you could ever buy in the store, topped with feta, kalamata olives and red onions served with curry crackers and flatbread pita.  The hummus was very good, a little salty but good.  The flatbread was awesome!  So soft and warm and went together great with their hummus.  I wasn't too keen on the curry crackers.\n\nI need to go back for beer soon, the Perry Cider sounded good and they have their seasonal Raspberry Hefeweizen on tap too!",

Their bathrooms have been dirty every time if have ever been.  Always go to the potty before going to the restaurant.  Also, their pop machine is right near the bathroom entrance and there is never a caution wet sign, my little guy busted his bottom there.  Just be very cautious around the pop machines.

  "text": "The wine? Good. The tasting room? Chaotic and small with the feel of my grandmothers home.\n\nSaturday busy with kids and dogs running amuck. The dogs I can handle but the kids were throwing corks, playing between the bar our legs and making more noise than the bachelorettes. Cute and quirky little place that looks as if it was put together with stuff from my garage. The music is a iTouch playing Pandora (nothing wrong with any of that) and played through a Bose SoundDock. The place is very noisy so maybe the music does not matter but it looks cheap and lowbrow. A lounge are with love seat and chair is the only sitting area with some high tops and the bar to stand around. It's cramped in here. There is a private tasting room with large, dining room table but it was closed off. Would be great to have a sofa in there too for overflow and there were less than 20 of us in there.\n\nThe wine is worth trying. I enjoyed the Pinot only, Purist Flight for $15. After the kids (and parents hopefully) were sent to bed and I could hear myself think, I asked the two staffers behind the bar, \"What makes Drake special?\" and \"Why should I like it?\". With so many Santa Barbara County wines to taste in the Funk Zone, I wanted to know more about Drake. The extremely friendly and knowledgeable explained the wine maker, Mark, had worked on some large Pinot projects for other, area companies and that this was a family company with a love of wine. Their story went on and made me fell like I was part of something different. This little winery produces some good stuff. \n\nWhile the wine definitely deserve a repet visit, I'll hold off all week until Fried Chicken and Waffles with Pinot Fridays. Yep. Apparently it's a real thing on the first and third Fridays through the summer and I'll be back to eat my fill. And for that, the review of the tasting room bumped up a notch.\n\nThe wine is good but I'm not a huge fan of the room. Perhaps it will grow on me. Just keep your kids at home please.\nCheers Drake",

  "text": "It's huge, it's awesome, it's open! South Philadelphia has been my usual wine and spirits stomping ground, but now my liver is really in for it with this gem open in the neighborhood.  The wine selection is amazing, as is pretty much the entire selection of every liquor.  The first day they were open I bought a bottle of St. Germain, a handle of Bacardi select, and a bottle of wine, for under $65, so the prices are pretty lovely as well.  The staff was super helpful and knowledgeable of the product and store layout. \n\nThis is more than a step up, this is a whole escalator up from the liquor store we used to have to deal with in Northern Liberties.  Mad Dog varieties have been replaced with fine wines and spirits.  There's short-term parking on a Girard, and a parking lot behind the store.  It's like they actually care about their customers!",

  "text": "I am going to dream of these beignets and marmalade. Oh, that marmalade. They were definitely the star of the show for me, but let's get to the nitty gritty.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is wedged in a strip mall in the far reaches of the north side. I am a downtown girl, so getting me to the north side takes a lot of convincing. I have to say, this was worth it. The decor is bright and airy and the food is fantastic. \n\nWe started with the beignets (have I mentioned how great these were?) and then I moved on to Simply Salmon. The salmon tasted fresh and it had a great seasoning rub on it. It was laid on a bed of greens, garlic, mushrooms, and asparagus. So good. Whenever I can have an excuse to pretty much eat a few whole cloves of garlic, it's a good day. My plate priced out around $13 and it was well worth the asking price. You could go in here for a simple breakfast and spend under $10, or get a little fancy and push it to $20-25. I feel like it would be a great experience either way.",

The room was huge with a big bathroom complete with tub and shower, kitchen, living room and bedroom. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. All of the staff we dealt with was very friendly and helpful. Based on previous reviews, we didn't waste our time with the breakfast so I can't speak to that, but we did enjoy the cookies the couple of nights we were there which were very fresh and delicious. Also, the location is close enough to all the action of center city but also in a quiet neighborhood which is a nice balance. I definitely will be returning to the Morris House.",

  "text": "I am not an expert on Fishtown or beer gardens, so I have no idea whether Frankford Hall is a good fit for the neighborhood, and I couldn't tell you whether Stephen Starr executed the \"authentic German beer garden\" concept with fidelity. \n\nI can tell you that there are certain things that go along with the Stephen Starr territory. For example, prices. Everything costs about a dollar more than you think it should cost. But you're paying for the experience of being In A Stephen Starr Restaurant, and you have sort of agreed implicitly to do that by, well, walking into a Stephen Starr restaurant. If that's not your thing, then don't go to Stephen Starr restaurants, dude.\n\nAnyway, I like the beer garden concept. I like being in the open air a lot. It was nice and breezy! I also liked the \"pay as you go\" concept of going to the counter to order beers and food myself. The vegetarian fare was delicious- I loved my sausage and the red cabbage that comes on the side and the potato pancakes, while quite different from the latkes I make at home, were flavorful and generously topped with sour cream and chives. \n\nBut the beer and pretzels is what really did it for me. I started with a Franziskaner Hefeweizen and then moved on to Bitburger, which suited the food much better. I also tried the My Antonia which was great! Eight bucks for a pretzel is steep, but they are enormous, and wow, THAT MUSTARD!!! \n\nWhen we left around 10, there was a line out the door and it was definitely more of a bridge-and-tunnel Old City crowd. So if you want to avoid that, just go there earlier in the night like we did. We arrived around 7:30 and had no trouble getting a table. \n\nThis isn't a place I will go to frequently- it's on the other side of town and it's expensive. But for a change of pace, we definitely made a good choice to visit Frankford Hall.",

The main reason I like it is because of the views of the water. I love to fish, and nothing gets me amped for my trip like driving over this bridge. I dunno, it kinda sets the mood or something? Anyway, the traffic does suck, and unfortunately I have been caught in that a few times. The view of downtown and the city coming back is pretty cool. There is also some nice scenery in spots on the way to St Pete as well. People do speed down this thing at night, so be careful/keep right.",

  "text": "I would rate Taqueria Feliz a 3.5. I've now been here twice now. The first visit was a bit subpar and lackluster, but the second time definitely made up for it. \n\nWhat we ordered:\nFlight of tacos: The tacos were pre-created but it was everything I wanted for being the indecisive person I am. Three tacos came in one order and included a steak, fish, and shrimp. I think the best of all of them was the shrimp, but they were all really tasty. I love when tacos have a lot of veggies on top and fruit salsa. Mango salsa is my favorite especially when it's atop something spicy.\n\nCeviche: This ceviche is unlike any kind I've had before. I only had a bite.  I feel like most ceviche is mostly \"cooked\" with lime juice and is essentially raw seafood. This version was different- it was tomato based. The base of the ceviche was shrimp but instead of tasting very citrusy, it was topped with a cocktail sauce. The horseradish gave the seafood a nice kick and some flavor, without it being overbearing.\n\nMy friend had the brussel sprout tacos, but I didn't try them. She says she has dreams about them so I imagine they are delicious. I'm hit or miss with Brussels so I probably wouldn't order them, but if you love them. ORDER THEM IMMEDIATELY.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nThe salsa: It's not that I didn't like it; I just didn't care for it. I'm just not a fan of the heavy chipotle flavored salsa. I like it more tomato and mild. It wasn't overly spicy.\n\nAll in all, I would go back to Taqueria Feliz. The tacos were great, the portions are about average and the atmosphere is fun. If you're in the heart of downtown Manayunk and in the food for Mexican, head to Taqueria Feliz (just don't get the sangria, you might be disappointed).",

We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and gave me such amazing news when I told her I was celiac...They had gluten-free pizza!!!!  It was forever ago I had good pizza.  Celiac pretty much destroyed my ability to love all things pizza.  Not only was it free of gluten, but the crust was good, the sauce was good, the cheese was good, the pepperoni was good... it was damn good!  My wife got a slice of the NY pizza and that looked impressive.  She said it was spot on.  They also had gluten-free beer!!!  Going to church with Grandma paid off!  It was like I went back in time to when I was ignorant to how wheat was destroying my insides, but without destroying my insides.

I find the staff to be attentive, professional and accomodating when possible. \n\nThis location is very close to the Causeway bridge. Essentially you can be headed on the Northshore if you miss your turn for the building. The hotel is located inside of an office building. I find this to be a positive for several reasons. Other patrons are primarily adults, some are business travelers and the rooms are not as worn as mainstream properties. In addition to this, the property is pretty quiet, which I prefer. The beds are very comfortable and the tvs are flat screens. Rooms have a city view or lake view and corner rooms have plenty of windows which I love. \n\nThis location is about a 15 - 20 minute drive to downtown New Orleans and it is 5-10 minutes from many area restaurants. PF Changs, Bravos, Le Madeleine, Drago's, Crazy Johnnie's, Phil's Grill, Red Lobster, Andrea's, Shogun and Acme Oyster House are very close. Ito is also down the street from Lakeside Shopping Mall which is one the major shopping malls in the metropolitan area. \n\nI would recommend this to anyone with the exception that by doing so, I am letting the cat out of the bag.",

Everything from start to finish was top notch. Brittney, our server, was next level good. She was attentive and offered some valuable suggestions on the dishes that we ordered. The last time we had the same level of service was when we had dinner at Prime 47. We were also checked on by two managers which was a nice change of pace when compared to similar experiences we have had when visiting other restaurants of comparable caliber. We started with the Pecorino Cheese dip with clover honey; I would not be surprised if it was the best appetizers on the menu. That was followed by Shrimp+Lobster Fettuccine for me and Lobster Ravioli for my wife. If I had the opportunity to eat there seven days in a row I would ask to be seated in Brittney's section and order the Same starter and entree every day. It was that good.

My older companion was beat from the heat and needed something to eat and drink without further walking and exploring. The \"food court\" sign on the JAX building raised our hopes that we would find something appealing.\n\nWere I by myself, I would have departed and hunted around Decatur Street for someplace more intriguing, but given the situation, I guided my companion to a seat, scanned the menu at Hotsy's, and ordered half of a muffaletta sandwich, which we split, and a couple of beverages. A muffaletta is an New Orleans version of an Italian \"hoagie\" of \"sub sandwich,\" consisting of Italian meats, cheese, and a layer of chopped olive salad topping on a special loaf of white bread that is round and soft.\n\nThe sandwich turned out to be a good choice. Its size was just right for the state of our appetites (my companion LOVED it), but it seemed expensive given the restrained portion of meat, cheese and topping on the bread.\n\nThe sandwich by itself earns three stars.

  "text": "Health Mutt is a very awesome, neighborhood pet store featuring all natural pet treats and foods, along with some terrific pet toys, accessories, and grooming services for the Fido's and Fluffy's in your life. \n\nI am a huge lover of four-legged pets, but unfortunately I lost my favorite feline to degenerative kidney failure a while back. With my crazy travel and work schedule it's not fair for me to take on the responsibility of saving a new shelter pet, but then constantly be putting my little buddy into the kennel when I'm on the road. Instead I depend upon the generosity of my business partner to let me sit on the floor and play with his two dogs whenever we work from his house.\n\nSIDE BAR COMMENT:  I recently purchased a Seminole Heights Unites \"Fires Die - Community Lives\" t-shirt to support the employees of Domani Bistro and A Modern Line furniture store, following the devastating fire which destroyed the restaurant and damaged the furniture store next door. 100% of the proceeds, after the raw cost of the garment, are donated to the employees, so this is a really good cause -- http://heightsunites.bigcartel.com/product/fires-die-community-lives-t-shirt. Earlier this week I received an email saying that the t-shirts were ready for pickup at Health Mutt in Seminole Heights. Turns out that the owner of the pet store is a big supporter of Seminole Heights' businesses, and was instrumental in creating the local team to support these two businesses and their staffs. Very cool!!!\n\nOK, BACK TO OUR STORY:  Health Mutt sits just a few blocks east of Florida Avenue at the intersection of Hanna and Central Avenues, right in the heart of Seminole Heights. I parked out front, and wandered into the store to take a look around. My plan was to pick up my t-shirt, and also find some doggie treats for my business partner's two dogs, Izzi and Belle.\n\nBill likes to say that Izzi and Belle are sisters from different mothers since Izzi is a pomeranian, and Belle is a black Lab, but their personalities are like twin sisters. I'm often showered with dog love and affection the moment that I walk in his front door, and I have to play with them and give them treats before they let Bill and I get down to work.\n\nCharlie from Health Mutt was a huge help in navigating my way through the myriad of dog treat options, and I ended up buying a box of all-natural Cloud Star \"Wag more bark less\" baked applewood-smoked bacon dog treats which will keep me on the good side of Izzi and Belle for the next few weeks. I also picked up some appropriately-sized Barkworthies Bully stick chew thingies which are much better than those nasty ol' rawhide chews.\n\nWhile Charlie was getting my t-shirt from the back room, I had the chance to watch one of the staff bathing and grooming a few dogs, and was very impressed by her attention to the dogs and her gentle demeanor. \n\nThe store is packed with healthy and great quality food and treats, and there were all sorts of toys, collars, harnesses, leashes, and bedding just waiting for you to take home. Super friendly people, and you can tell that they really enjoy working with pets and their owners. Great little find in the middle of Seminole Heights.",

But I still remember how delicious it was - especially with coffee.  \n\nStaff was very friendly, happy and helpful.\n\nIndoor and outdoor seating (beautiful patio and if you get lucky, you can meet a cat, who likes to hang out there :-) and WiFi are perfect for those with laptops. \n\nWe love this place and when we are back in NOLA, this is the first stop :-)\n\nPS: Even the restroom is extraordinary :-)",

  "text": "I'm really sorry to rain on everyone's parade and go against consensus, but although Spruce Street Harbor Park is just what the area needed, I don't think it lives up to the hype.\n\nHammocks are great and all, but they are already pretty gross after the whole neighborhood has tried them out. And how can you have beer and food with no restrooms? Perhaps this is another ploy by the city to raise money through the issuance of public urination fines.\n\nI love how they repurposed the boxcars or what appears to be outdated shipping containers, but the overall layout looks like a politician designed it and tried too hard to appeal to hipsters. Again, sorry to rain on the parade, but I think people will realize that this park is average after the novelty wears off.",

So my boyfriend and I wanted to go to On Swann but they had just closed. We thought we just couldn't find the right door. So we walked around the area and came across this gem. It's such a cute date spot. He loved his Bloody Mary, and my Bellini was so good! \n\nI couldn't decide between four things and our server Kevin gave me an amazing recommendation! I got a mixed skillet of the clams and mussels and they were by far the best I've ever had! They had this amazing Smokey flavor I just can't get over!!\n\nMy boyfriend had pasta, he's Sicilian himself and said it was the best he's had at any restaurant and perfectly al dente! We'll definitely be back! I'll honestly probably get the same thing because it was so delicious. :)",

You wouldn't know it from the outside, but when you walk in you are immediately impressed by the warm decor. \n\nYou walk straight into their beautiful wine store. They also have cheeses & meats which the manager explained can be made into a charcuterie board... YUM!\n\nOnce you walk through the store they have a HUGE patio area. Upstairs is the coolest bar! This is where we chose to spend our time. The bartender was AWESOME! She explained different drinks as well as specials, food, and local info. My husband had a gin fizz which he had never had before. He loved it!\n\nThey have weekly specials as well as entertainment. I would highly suggest a visit while visiting NOLA. I'm sure glad we did!",

My girlfriend and I were there early (5ish) as we were attending a beer drinking event that evening, so we wanted to fill our bellies.  Well, one of us was pretty full of chips prior to the meal, but you get the point...\n\nI love hand pumped, cask, firkin whatever you call it beer.  It makes any beer 20% better.  So props to Kennett on this.  Doesn't even matter what was in there, but at the time it was a cask-conditioned Yards ESA and all was good in the world.\n\nAs mentioned it was early, so the dinner crowd hadn't arrived yet.  Comfortable interior with maybe one or two other tables occupied at the time.  A guy who I assume was an owner chatted with one table as he prepped for the evening.  Very welcoming and they seem to care about their business.  Having owners/employees who actually give a damn means a lot.\n\nThis translated to the food.  Had the porchetta pizza.  The pork was super, super tender.  So much so you forgot it was on the pizza after you took a bite as no effort was needed to chew the stuff.  Also because it wasn't greatly falvorful, a subtle flavor that was nice albeit could've used a little more kick.  Just my opinion.  Also tried the lamb burger which was described by my Turkish girlfriend as tasting like a Turkish kofte which is some high praise.  She ate it with a knife and fork.\n\nI will be back, that marrow on the regular burger is screaming my name.  \"Briannn...I want to be in *your* boneessss...\"",

The line is long and out the door but moves quick. They have limited options throughout the week on their menu so I'd look in advance before going. Since it is cafeteria style you feel a bit more rushed but a place like this is expected to have that feel. My friends and I ordered the chicken and dumplings, catfish, turnip greens, banana pudding, and Mac and cheese. Chicken and dumplings was good just too watery. The turnip greens were absolutely amazing! I need more of that in my life! My friends loved the desserts and said they were the best part of the course. The sides such as the mac were good but small portions for the prices you paid. We enjoyed the food and would come back again but throughout our Nashville experience we had some better food experiences for the pricing too.",

That said, they humans tend to be pretty attentive here and there were a few \"tussles\" that humans broke up (even if it wasn't their dog involved) and everyone went back to playing.

Over the years we've shared our fair amount of good versus bad experiences with this place and the staff.  We sit in the 300 section because we love the view of the entire field but the concession lines no matter where you sit are always so long and slow.  The staff or volunteers that they get to run these areas need to step it up.  What is frustrating more than anything is that they don't have specific lines at every service kiosk just for refills.  After purchasing your souvenir mug that is refillable, they should have areas where you can go just get them refilled and not have to stand in the LONG lines again just for a refill.  They did change up some of the food options and places for this football season, which is nice but they are all located on the lower level which does nothing for the upper level fans unless you want to travel down to the lower level and deal with that crowd.",

  "text": "Let me start by saying the steaks are on point. They use quality meats and know how to cook them to perfection. The other dishes and desserts on the other hand don't all match in quality. I dinned at Rococo on business with 3 other people. We got the opportunity to sample a large portion of their menu and a few fabulous wines. I like the traditional steakhouse menu with modern local dishes, it's a good combo and believe me there is NO shortage of options. In fact there may be too many options. We started with wine, the entire book of wine, there is something for EVERYONE and ANYONE, typical of a traditional steak house. After more time than I'd have preferred we settled on a universal red. Next the appetizers and salad. We went with the octopus bacon and special beet salad. The beet salad was amazing, the goat cheese mouse and Marcona Almonds were a perfect complement to the beets! Plus, we ordered two for the table and they portioned and plated the salad accordingly, which is always nice. The octopus on the other hand was prepared well but paired oddly. The capers and the puree seamed to fight the octopus. While this is typically a favorite of mine, it left me wanting more. (Or perhaps it was simply over shadowed by the beet salad.) The steaks arrived and were promptly devoured soon there after. The mushrooms were done beautifully and I liked the combination of fungi. But, the mac and cheese was nothing to write home about. It looked and tasted like a supped up box of Velveeta Shells and Cheese, not that I was looking for lobster or anything mind blowing, but a bit of texture and a bit more of a flavor profile would have been nice. We finished with two desserts, the first I cannot recall as I did not act fast enough to taste and the second a chocolate Crème Brulee, one of my all time favorites. If you are a lover of Crème Brulee you will understand my disappointment with the following sequence of events. I picked up my spoon, eager to tap the surface of the dish and watch the caramelized top crack in a most unpredictable pattern. Excited for the first bite, by far the best bite of the dish, you only finish the dish because you are hopefully that you will get a second bite as wonderful as the first, deep down knowing that was THE BITE. To my dismay, no crack! With dim lighting and since the dish is brown, I couldn't tell, did I miss the noise? Is the layer so thin it melted in my mouth? So I did what any adventurous eater does, took a bite, and another. It was cold mush. Just Crème, no Brulee. The staff sent out a new dish and was kind enough to take it off the bill, but the second did not satisfy, I still had the taste of the limp and cold first round in my mind.  I'll most likely go back, but with a little caution. They have the most important ingredient down pat and I guess that's what's most important. \n\nSide Note: Great décor and service, intimate and inviting, a surprise on this side of downtown.",

They also have the exclusive Reserve Roastery blends (only a fraction of Starbucks locations offer these) so if you really like specialty blends/ exotic beans, you can find them here. I give it three stars though, because they are so slow every time I come here. I'd say I wait on average one minute for my drink at most Starbucks locations, but every time I come here I'm consistently waiting 4 or more minutes. Doesn't seem like a lot, but it feels like an eternity when other locations (and other coffee joints) have a much quicker speed of delivery. It's puzzling that they're so slow because they always have 5 or 6 employees in there that appear to just be getting in the way of one another behind the counter.",

  "text": "La Familiga has been in operation since 1976. That's 40 years from 2016, math majors. Let me start by tipping my figurative hat to such success in a tough restaurant industry. \n\nTheir 40th anniversary rollback menu and pricing was actually what drew me in for my recent visit. I had recalled enjoying my experience about a decade ago, but this restaurant is far from hip and trendy and has likely missed its way back on to my very deep \"to-eat\" list.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a traditionally, upscale experience. The main dining room has a nostalgic antique feel. In all honesty, so did a lot of the other clientele. I say this not as a slight but as an observation. During the course of our meal, my husband and I were discussing how odd it is that an establishment of such stature only has 87 (now 88) reviews on Yelp. The older, more classically dignified demographic may be a factor. \n\nThe other reason for their staying power is that the food is damn good. Nothing else will keep you afloat like an exemplarily meal. \n\nGoing off of other Yelper's recommendations, we started by picking a bottle of wine from the holy bible of vino. We ended up with a lovely Chianti that paired perfectly with our dinner. \n\nAs millennials, we went a non-traditional approach in ordering and started with pasta dishes instead of salads. As others had mentioned the pesto gnocchi is excellent but different. I believe the difference is the potato and ricotta blend that causes the texture to be a little lighter. The pesto sauce was creamy but did not drown the dumpling blend. My husband's penne arribata was simple but exemplified what the dish should be. A little kick, some chunks of tomato and a top of fresh basil.\n\nWe decided to split two entrees: the Vitello Papa Sena (veal of the picante, mandolese and capri variety) and the Filetto all Familiga. I haven't had such tender veal cutlets in a while. Each sauce was different yet complimentary of each other. The white wine sauce paired with prosciutto and mozzarella for the mandolese was ultimately my favorite. Although the butter in picante and white wine with spinach and pepper topped with mozzarella of the capri were certainly enjoyable.  The Filetto was prepared in a wine sauce but more in a gravy styling. It put a nice Italian touch on a classic cut of steak. Of course, it was prepared to the temperature of our liking and completely on point.\n\nExpecting a traditional dessert menu, we were a little surprised when a tray of three options (that we've had previously never heard of) were presented to us. The Zuppa Inglese (an Italian dessert layering custard and sponge cake...thanks, Wiki) was the most intriguing. Consisting of a rum soaked cake with a light, fluffy yet crisp meringue-like topping, it hit the spot with a little post-dinner sweetness.\n\nFor this particular experience, the portions seemed to match the 1976 pricing, which is not necessarily a bad thing as I walked away content versus crammed. Perhaps if we ate like it was 1976, American waists would be more in line with a healthy standard, but I digress. \n\nWhile there are a million and one new restaurants in Philadelphia that are far more trendy than La Familiga, this is the spot to go if you are looking for an upscale Italian dining experience.\n\nWriter's note: after initially submitting this a 4 star review, I can't honestly give a reason that it shouldn't be a 5 star review. I don't typically give 5s out for infrequent visits or promotional menus, however there is absolutely no reason a star should be deducted due to my personal Yelp \"rules.\"",

This makes Dunders far more tolerable than it was previously, and actually a great place to have a brew and a bite!\n\nThe advantage of the bierhaus-style tables means it's great for groups as well, and you can hear multiple conversations and jump back and forth between them. Plus they have every kind of mustard on the planet, so if that's your thing you'll be able to try all of them.\n\nThe crowd is everything from USF grad students to hipsters of both variety (ironic and non-ironic). But get there earlier if you want something more than a sandwich, as they shut a bunch of the kitchen down at 10pm, thus meaning you can't get your schnitzel fix after that hour. \n\nA pretty authentic kind of place that's beloved by it's loyal customers... and now I'm a much bigger fan than I was before!",

  "text": "I came here with a friend on a busy Saturday afternoon, and we were seated almost immediately. The service was prompt and friendly, coming with ample suggestions for drinks. I went with the Bakersfield Margarita with salt and shared the queso with a friend. The margarita was quite lovely, the perfect amount of lime balanced with the smoothness of their tequila. Though I did get a massive headache afterwards, this does tell me they don't skimp on the buzz. The queso was pretty decent, though it is a bit different than the fare typically offered in quesos in the southwest. This particular appetizer is quite chunky with an ooziness that is quite delectable. I'm not quite sure it's the best combination with the margarita I got, quite a bit more oily than the two of us bargained for.\n\nAmbience was cool, with a nouveux-industrial feeling: open ceiling, concrete, and wood block bars with warm lighting. It has a great corner location and felt quite welcoming. Pretty dim, considering the mood lighting, but fitting for the atmosphere.",

I chose the bread pudding with herbs, mushroom and kale. It was wonderfully reminiscent of stuffing. Im taking one star off here are we waited about 30minutes until this dish arrived. Otherwise the tea service was fantastic. The scones were delicious, i couldn't  get enough of the clotted cream and jam. Everything is made from a scratch, including the bread for the cucumber sandwiches. Cally herself came by to recommend eating the meringue with clotted cream, it was delicious! Although I think that cream could make everything delicious. The high tea was $40, which is cheaper than other high tea options in town. I would return for the lovely atmosphere and delicious scones",

A visit to South Korea to visit relative when I was 8 just added fuel to the fire which explains why this 31 year old woman owns a Hello Kitty bathrobe. Being an adult certainly doesn't mean that you have to be mature at all times, right?\n\nHappy Japan is cute specialty store with new digs in the cozy Berry Hill neighborhood. I never visited their previous location was on Gallatin Road but from sheer neighborhood cred, this new location must be a total upgrade for them. Being nestled next to See Spot Eat and Pied Piper Creamery makes a lot of sense as kiddos are sure to drag their moms in here post snack and anyone who will purchase their pup gourmet baked goods is likely to give this place a while too. (I'm clearly one of those people) I loved the layout of the store which happens to be a little cottage and walked through the 4 rooms that comprise the retail area with ease and curiosity.\n\nIn the main area, I enjoyed sifting through the Asian candies, cookies, and other treats. The prices are fair especially because these goods had to be imported. One of the rooms featured Anime items along with a collection of stuffed animals and figures. Another room showcased gear for wanna-be Harajuku girls that included wigs, platform shoes, and dresses. Why do I want a blue wig now? Because. In the 4th room, various trinkets ranging from magnets or books to cooking utensils and paper goods were displayed. \n\nI enjoyed the store but kept thinking that there would be more? I just didn't feel inspired enough to purchase anything. I'll definitely come back to check on their inventory and for gift items.",

A few weeks after it opened, I ventured in bright-eyed, bushy-tailed. \n\nVerdict: At least they have nice staff and nice decor. \n\nHonestly I wasn't clear on the difference between Parisian crepes and Japanese-style ones but I hope what I tasted at T-swirl isn't representative of the latter. We split their lychee romantic crepe with raspberry and rose cream. Sounds lovely, right? Well, fellas, don't count on this to woo your lady friends because it was anything but romantic. Actually it was more of a sad romance gone bad. \n\nFirst, I don't know if the crepes here are supposed to be made fresh because ours definitely wasn't. It might be different if served with ice cream but this one isn't. Maybe you're saying, okay, so what? Well, read on. \n\nThe crepe came out flat with a smidgen of cream, torn bits of canned lychee sparsely spread on top, two visible raspberries and maybe one pistachio grounded to pieces (see pic). Half way through we'd already forgotten what we ordered because there was nothing left but a thin layer of cream. Was it 40% off? No, but it probably should've been because it felt like 40% of it was missing. If you're coming here, at least don't get this. For $7, my friend would've made something better - and I doubt he even cooks. \n\nOk maybe I'm being slightly dramatic (not really). Maybe we messed up and went with the only bad option on the menu. Maybe they were running out of ingredients. But as much as I'd like to think all of that, I'm just not convinced to give it another chance anytime soon.",

Each sub shop I've been to has always been the same, right down to the motto, \"subs so fast you'll freak.\" It's nothing fancy and what you see is what you get.

We had a friendly conversation with the franchise owner who gave us a brief history of Jimmy John's (as if I didn't know-I am from Illinois after all) and me, my sister and my Christian sat down for what would be my first decent lunch in Reno. It's so sad that it had to a fast food place like Jimmy John's but thank goodness it always has been reliable and good to me for the last ten years. \n\nMy sandwich was perfect to say the least. The bread was fluffy and hot, and the meat, lettuce, tomato and mayo had a consistent and even ratio. I personally like to shove jalapeno chips to my sandwiches to add a crunchy texture to my sandwiches and Jimmy John's kettle cooked chips make a perfect addition. I obsess over their sandwiches and if they had any in the Bay Area, I'd probably be their best customer in the history of Jimmy John's.",

They were extremely welcoming, accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly. \n\nUpon arriving, we were dropped off on 7th Ave. by our Uber and the entrance was nowhere to be found. After a long cross-country trip, this was a very poor first impression. The 7th Ave entrance requires a key card, which you have to check in first obviously to obtain. We ended up lugging our carryons around the entire block looking for an entrance until we stumbled across a stranger and asked if he was staying at the hotel. He then informed us that if we walked up the ramp to the parking area, main entrance would be at the end of the 2nd floor parking. Consider yourself informed. \n\nUnfortunately, the lovely people who work here are not enough to make up for the fact that this location is not in a great part of town - with the trolley line running right next to the hotel, getting woken up multiple times throughout the night to what sounded like large dumpsters rolling down the street was extremely disturbing and I was exhausted my entire trip due to the trolley noise, as well as the air conditioning system that sounded like a plane taking off every 15 minutes to maintain the temperature. The extremely thin walls did nothing to mask the very loud fellow guests that were yelling and wandering down the halls very late into the evening (past midnight) and early in the morning either. If you're a light sleeper, consider yourself warned. They do provide earplugs which is a nice gesture, but when you have to get up early for meetings, it was a risk I couldn't take of not hearing the alarm.\n\nI will definitely stay in the Hilton downtown next time I'm in town for work and avoid this place at all costs.",

I bought art and also had henna done on my hands, which I thought was pretty cool too.  I had a lovely afternoon at the Talbot Street Art Fair.  However, I do have two critiques:\n\n(01) Prior to coming, I checked their website to see if pets were allowed, but I saw nothing.  I brought my dachshund in tow, but when we arrived, there was a wishy-washy sign that discouraged you from bringing your dog, yet I saw people with their dogs all around.  I was confused: why no definite answer?  Now, my puppy did no harm at the art fair, and I didn't feel as if her presence was a big deal for the fair-goers.  In fact, many people asked to pet her, and one of the artisans even held her while I chose and purchased a piece from him.  Still, I think the organizers should make up their mind about this specific issue in order to prevent confusion.\n\n(02) Nicey Treat was there, which was awesome and refreshing on a warm, sunny day, but why not bring in some more food trucks?  It's not like Indianapolis has a shortage of them!  With an art fair that is so anticipated and popular, I would have loved to see more than Pineapple Delight and popcorn. Save that for the State Fair.  Besides, food is art.  Showcase it with some tasty stuff!\n\nWill I come back next year?  Yes.  Will I bring my Dachshund? Most likely, if the organizers can make up their minds.",

Before the evening was over well all had a better understanding and appreciation of wine.   If you are interested in joining a wine club you should check out this spot. \n\nThe atmosphere was relaxing and laid back (the wine may have had something to do with this), they provided great customer service and I would love to go back during the day to try more wine and take in the view.",

  "text": "This place is a staple in Indianapolis over in the international marketplace. Most people who have been around the city long enough and explore ethnic food have tried this joint. Now with so many other vietnamese restaurants opening all around the city, there is a lot of competition. I think that Saigon still fares pretty decently to the others in town. For one, the menu is extensive. Most vietnamese dishes that one would seek in larger more diverse metro areas are present on this menu. Secondly, the portions are very fair for the price. Taste is good imo, however, the quality of the meat is questionable. My wife is much more on the meat picky and mostly vegetarian spectrum than myself, but the way she qualifies a vietnamese cuisine is based on grilled meat quality (as she is a bún lover). I agree with her most of the time, and on saigons behalf, I agree- meat quality mediocre at best. Otherwise, definitely worth trying out.",

I had the buffet, which was very nice and clean. Tacos, burritos, tostitos, and some other thing that was rolled up and fried. You can also build a nacho platter which is what I did. They only have Pepsi products, huge downer if you are a Diet Coke fan (which I am). Our waitress was so friendly and funny, I tipped her nicely just because of her personality....",

  "text": "The hubby and I are about to become parents, and last night, after having some maternity photos taken, we stopped by Burger Republic on our way home to try it out. I love that they offer some healthier alternatives than straight ground beef (i.e. ground turkey, chicken, veggie burgers, etc.). While the husband ordered a Hawaiian burger and fries, I opted for the Burger Republic made with ground turkey and a side salad.\n\nI'm not much of a burger gal, but I've gotta say I really liked the one I had here. The service was a little slow (they seemed to be slammed with not quite enough servers on duty), but the fries were hot and fresh. (Come on! I'm pregnant, and they smelled good.) My side salad was made with spinach, which was a bonus since I kinda hate iceberg lettuce. Obviously, I can't comment on the beers, but what I saw on the menu looked good.\n\nOverall, I'm glad this joint moved into our neck of the woods, and I'm sure we'll be back one night when we have a hankering for a solid burger.",

  "text": "As much as I'm  here I figured I should write a review.\n\nThis is a pretty nice store as far as grocery stores go. I've always had great experiences with their very friendly staff, and they have good prices.  Of course, being 15 minutes walking distance from my house with self-service a gas station available definitely gives it brownie points in my book.  Their sushi station is very fun, and I know a lot of my neighbors appreciate the Starbucks.  \n\nI love that they have a wellness machine in the store.  With a family history of high blood pressure, I like checking mine every once and a while and seeing my BMI makes me stick to my exercise a bit more regularly.   I also love their online coupons.  I haven't gotten into couponing (yet, there are lots of coupon queens who come to the store and their tiny grocery bills are rather tempting), but Fry's online coupons tailored to my previous food purchases is an easy way to save some money\n\nI do have an issue with their customer service over the phone.  I've called a few times to check if they have certain items or to ask about sales and events. I seem to always get wrong answers or the staff have no idea what I'm talking about.   Better off just going on your own if you can.\n\nTheir produce selection can also be abyssal at certain days/times.  I've gone in to find them out of literally over half their produce.  Kinda frustrating, but understandable I guess on busy days. I always try to shop earlier in the day now.",

  "text": "I'm always up for checking out a new food truck, but because I'm a vegetarian, this one was not one of the trucks that I sought out intentionally.  However, Chop Shop is, and they were at City Garden with 2 Girls 4 Wheels a few days ago.  My boyfriend is a meat and potatoes kind of guy, not a sushi guy, so he decided to order from here instead.  Because I hate to be left out, even though I got my food from Chop Shop, I had to have their grilled cheese too.\n\nAll of their main offerings (pulled pork sandwich, cheesesteak, chili, brats, slinger) are under 6 dollars, and the grilled cheese, advertised as having a hint of sweet flavor, and with a dipping sauce, is only 4 dollars.  They also have chips (some weird brand with a rapper's face on them...kind of strange), gooey butter cake, and soda.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which he didn't like that much, and while I liked the grilled cheese, it was kind of basic.  What set it apart was the sweet flavor that came through every few bites, probably from the bread, and it was cooked very well.  The dipping sauce was marinara, which I found to be quite odd.  I love the concept of a dipping sauce, but who wants marinara on their grilled cheese?  I would love to see them add a pesto, aioli, garlic butter...that would definitely bring me back.  Also, how about some fries or something?  Some people don't like rap on their radios or on their potato chip bags!\n\nI'm a big food truck supporter, but overall, the experience was just ok for me.  The prices are reasonable, the grilled cheese was well cooked, and I think there is potential here.  Maybe I'm not their target clientele (I don't eat meat), but I'd love to see more vegetarian options, or at least some different dipping sauce and side options.",

  "text": "I love Panera/Bread Co! Food is really good and pretty healthy if you're looking for a fast food type of thing that's beyond just a sandwich. The bread bowls are seriously fantastic in both taste and the amount you get for the price you pay. My favorites are tomato, baked potato and chicken orzo. Not really a fan of their clam chowder.\n\nAs for the sandwiches, all the paninis are tasty and I really like the turkey on tomato basil bread. All of their salads are great too! Big fan of the Asian sesame chicken and Thai chopped chicken, really amazing taste profiles for a salad.\n\nThe breads, bagels and treats are really good too! I highly recommend the asiago bagel and the red velvet cookie. Can't complain much about anything but I have to say that this location gets pretty busy during the lunch hour. And of course since they make their stuff fresh everyday there isn't really much left to buy towards the end of the day. Sometimes their baguettes aren't as big as other locations too.\n\nService is outstanding most days but I guess they have their off days too because sometimes they can get pretty snappy. Overall though, this Bread Co is one of the best I've been to.",

  "text": "This was easily the highlight of my visit to Nashville. General admission is $17, and it's worth every penny. \n\nit's not a very big museum, but it's full of stuff. There's stations to listen to his music, and there's a back room that shows a film about Cash and features his work. \n\nThere's so many things on display. There's a ton of outfits, hats, and boots that he wore on TV or in concert. His gear from his time in the military is there, furniture from their home is there. There's hand written lyrics sheets and love letters and the awards he received. There's even a door from prison on display there. I love Johnny Cash, and it was awesome to get to see some of this stuff first hand.\n\nI also really liked that there's no guide, so you can stroll and read at your leisure. I like the no-pressure situation. \n\nOn the way out, there's also a gift shop. There's shirts, books, albums, jewelry, and all kinds of things boasting his picture or his lyrics. I ended up buying my girlfriend a bar of soap that smelled like mint called Aloe, I'm Johnny Splash, because two puns are better than one. \n\nThere's also a cafe here. We didn't get a chance to pay it a visit, but I think it's pretty cool. If I was from the area, no doubt I'd hang out there more often. \n\nIf you're a fan of Cash or of country and rock music, be sure to stop here next time you're in Nashville.",

The crust is too thick and doughy/chewy for my taste. \n\nI did used to like to come here for an appetizer that was absolutely amazing for any olive lover, it's was an olive cheese bread. But they no longer have it on the menu! So upset they got rid of my favorite thing! No clue why, it was delicious. \n\nThe mellow mushroom soup is pretty good. Last time I came here with a group I had mushroom soup and wings, cause like I said before I don't like the main attraction, the pizza lol. The wings and soup and other various sides are good. They also have a nice beer selection. Service is a hit or miss but in my experience typically it's slow.",

  "text": "Molasses bacon rimmed glasses was the highlight to my Bloody Mary.  Been to Farm and Fisherman's a handful of times. Each time we enjoyed our Meal, their Menu is creative and rotates, nice add to the area. Here's the scoop on my most recent visit: \n\nWe were seated by a large family who were gathered there for some type of celebration so we requested a table by the window and they moved us. No issue.\n\nAmbience is nice. Big and open inside. Nice layout, appeals to a great variety of age ranges, the brunch crowd was pretty mixed. \n\nTo date, I've tried lunch, dinner, and drinks at happy hour here. It's not remotely bad by any means, but it's also just not remarkable. I would venture to say it's a tad overrated. But again, happy that there's a location like F&F in this area - we needed it. \n\nPros: The food is fresh. Service is warm and friendly. Menu is creative. Love the farm to table concept.\n\nCons: Portions are small, prices do not match serving size. Food was good, combo of flavors just haven't made their mark for me.\n\nToday we came for Sunday brunch. We ordered the Chef's Breakfast which are smaller portions of breakfast/lunch items served on a wooden board with a beer and a shot of bourbon. The menu varies each week. For $22 this was the most bang for your buck here. Our board came with a southwest omelette, huevos rancheros, breakfast pizza and the turkey Rueben - all good. We also ordered a Bloody Mary (I think it was called the bloody pig because it came with bacon) I LOVE bacon so it was a bit disheartening when I discovered a thin, half slice broken into pieces in the drink. The rim was really good, bacon crumbled molasses - different, tasty.\n\nThe turkey reuben was my favorite on the board, and despite the inconsistency in texture (some parts of the meat tough & dry, some tender) it still packed the complexity in flavor the other dishes lacked.\n\nquality: food's fantastic. Cooked well and it seems like they only use the best ingredients and proteins. If on imagination and execution, however: I was satiated but not truly impressed. My food was good but lacked flavor. And for the price I am paying, I am expecting more. Just saying. \n\nBloody Marys.. nothing out of this world. One whole slice of thick bacon would have been awesome. They clearly used lots of spice, so points there, but it also overpowered the other flavors and left us with an upset tummy all day..\n\nWe finished off with the cinnamon donut holes. They were really good!\n\nThere's some genuine effort here that deserves to be commended with your dollars on behalf of the staff, and I'm at least curious to try other parts of the menu later this year.\n\nGreat concept and potential here though. Looking to revisit in a few months and update.",

  "text": "Since my initial review, I've been back here quite a bit and thus felt the need to update. \n\nInitially, I wanted to hate this place mostly due to the fact that it's insanely trendy and hipster-y...and also because the service initially wasn't the best. And the pasta didn't blow me away mostly due to it being too under-cooked at first. There are aspects of Pastaria which are still not 100% perfect but let's face it, no one is perfect. (Although Taste is damn close, lol.) But I do feel as though they've improved a lot since I first went.\n\nTook my parents here for dinner when they came into town and their minds = blown. My old man couldn't get enough of their Brussels sprouts, and he loved their bolognese pasta too. My mom ordered the pasta dish with the apples in it and couldn't get enough of the combination (I must admit, it's pretty effing good.) My sister liked their pizza too. My friend came here with me and had the pepper cheese pasta dish and asked them to go light on the pepper. Now I order that dish the way she did because before, it was wayyy too peppery. It's just right when you order it like this, unless pepper is yo thang. My dad and I enjoyed the \"Primitivo\" zinfandel wine they have here too, and my mom enjoyed their Bellini cocktail. \n\nSo why no 5th star? OK, here's my beef with them: their policies. Like how they won't take reservations, and they won't seat partial parties. I get it. They have their reasons. But there are hundreds of other restaurants that DO take reservations and DO seat partial parties. And they are successful! Until they start doing those two things, I must withhold my fifth and final star, unfortunately. But that doesn't mean I won't go there anymore. I'll just plan to go there late at night or really really early so I can definitely get a table. And I'll have to coordinate better with my friends, which can be difficult especially when we're all driving from completely different towns and are unsure of the highway traffic and road construction, etc, etc.! Just really annoying and mostly an inconvenience because when I wanted to take my family there, they told me I couldn't get a reservation even for a party of 7 people or more. Wtf. My friend wasn't there yet either as something came up with her work and she had to call her boss on the fly, so I had to ask the server (not the hostess) if I could save the seat next to me for her. He said it was OK with him, lol, so it worked out. But they gave me so much crap when I asked to hold the seat for her. It's not like she was going to be an hour late and there were already five of us there. Jeez.\nI think it would piss me off a whole lot less if they weren't so snooty about it over the phone and in person. If they said, \"I'm so sorry, but please feel free to grab a drink/appetizer at the bar, grab a seat and make yourself at home while you wait.\" That would be nice. If only they actually read this shit and took into account people's feedback. If only!\n\nBut... also glad to know there is always the option of getting fresh pasta to go and fresh sauce as well. And gelato! I mean, shit, when I feel inclined to cook and actually do my own dishes, I will make a quick stop here and grab shit and go to avoid the stress of not having a reservation.\n\nIn summation:\n\n- my friends & parents love this joint\n- amazingly delish food & wine & desserts\n- can get said food & dessert to go if needed and cook at home\n- service is improving significantly\n- free fucking parking, FUCK yea (ask them to validate your ticket when you leave)\n- their policies still suck\n- Sean still hates it here, sadly\n- I feel like a fatass afterwards...but sooo worth it!\n\nI'm planning to bring Sean's parents to Pastaria next week, and I hope they don't mind eating early-ish to avoid waiting.",

We recently stopped in for dinner before a concert since we knew it would be a solid pick.  \nOur server was friendly and seemed to be enjoying her shift.  I find that to be such a nice thing when you're dining out...it can definitely make the mood of dinner more pleasant.  \nThe salsas are all great as is the guacamole too!  And of course the queso is a must if you love melted cheese like most cool people do!  The chips are thick but fresh and except for the fact that they fill you up quicker than you might want, are solid vehicles for the dips and salsas!  Grab a kale and mushroom taco too!  You will not be disappointed.  Oh, and the potatoes, beans & rice, and chicken enchiladas are also high points in my opinion.  \nI wish this location had a better patio but due to the location it isn't feasible I guess.  None the less I am glad to see that Indianapolis now has a Nada to visit.",

While the service was phenomenal, the food was just meh compared to other places I have eaten in the city on this trip. Specially, the gumbo was strangely like mushroom gravy (did not even come with rice). The foie gras had an interesting creole twist, and the filet was prepared correctly but not too impressed with the rest of the dish. It was actually quite salty. We tried bread pudding soufflé as well but again was not the experience of food I had been thinking it would be. Love the atmosphere and I am sure this is up many people's alley.

I sadly drank water and everyone else had beer or mixed drinks. I like that the drinks were all served in mason jars. It was very fitting with the cute, vintage tables & twinkle lights. Our server was really nice and our drinks were never empty. I personally really loved the veggie burger. I've never had a veggie burger made with beets but I want more! The bun tasted great but was a little more dense than a regular bun. Still, it didn't have the weird taste of some GF breads. It was just impossible to pick up and eat without the burger squishing out onto my plate. I do wish I could have eaten this like an actual burger and not with a fork, but it was still really tasty. There were other things on the menu that were tempting and my husband's pretzels looked awesome. Trivia was really fun and we will definitely be back!",

Upon entering you are greeted with smiles, pleasant demeanors, and super helpful staff. This is a fabulous spot on the Southside of Indy worth checking out. They have such a clean and open space for meeting with loved ones, working remotely, or just enjoying some time solo. I went in today with my 9 month old and everyone was super helpful and sweet. I love being able to go out and work remotely while having my baby accompany me without having to deal with attitude from people simple because I am there with my baby. She was so sweet and didn't get fussy until I was packing us up to leave so you know this space has great energies if the baby was cool, calm, and collected!\n\n The best part about this particular coffee house is they are a for benefit coffee house. They actually provide couples counseling and addiction counseling. I was so impressed I had to support them as much as I could by purchasing an egg sandwich, chocolate muffin, latté, sticker, and a t-shirt. It's not very often I find a place that moves me such as they have. If you find yourself on the Southside of Indy please stop in to check them out!",

  "text": "I really want to like this place.  I do.  I love brewpubs, and the place is gorgeous inside.  It felt very comfortable, and I was ready to buy a pint glass (a habit if I like a place) on the way in.  We were seated in what is normally an outside area, if it's not cold as hell out.  It Iooked nice in there, and the tenting, heat lamps, and fireplace made a nice winter backup.\n\nI'll even cover the rest of what I liked, before I rip this place a new one.  The beers I had are decent, not spectacular, but still pretty good in range and flavor.  The beer battered fries are damn good, and I ate a lot, which is odd, since I don't enjoy fries that much.  The roast beef sandwich was fantastic, and everything I'd want that little slice of comfort food to be, complete with au jus that didn't taste like cheap fat on the side.\n\nNow, why would I say all that, and give it one star?  I'm pretty sure I even gave a place where I saw a cockroach two stars, out of mercy with their food being so good.  Here's why:\n\n-- Free range kids.  Now, I'm not sure why anyone would bring their young children to a brewpub for a birthday party, but that is not the restaurant's fault.  How they handle it, on the other hand, is their problem.  First, if parents aren't doing their damn job, it is up to the restaurant to make sure other customers don't have to put up with your screaming crotchfruit running around.  There's also a safety issue, because you now have servers carrying trays and glasses of beer with this going on.  On top of both of those things, if other patrons ask you to do something (which we did), you talk to the parents, not ignore paying customers.\n\nSeriously, kids should be encouraged to play around and have fun. . . at a Chuck E Cheese or similar place.  I'm sorry, but this is not a Chuck E Cheese.  Oh and, if you want your restaurant to resemble that, which it seems like you did by sitting every family in the entire place in one room, then don't sit the childless young couple there too.  There were plenty of other open rooms in the joint that I'd have been comfortable in.\n\n-- Service.  Kids aside, our waitress was totally useless.  The place wasn't that busy, but she was nowhere to be seen for most of the night.  She screwed up at least one order, and was unresponsive at best when we did find her.  At least once, we had to flag down another server, who was harried from dealing with the birthday party parents.\n\n-- The hamburger.  Now, if there's one thing I expect out of a brewpub, it's to have a decent burger.  I've never been to one that had a terrible burger, and frankly some of the best ones seem to come from brewpubs.  They jacked it up, though.  Badly.  \"Medium\" is a common way to cook a burger and does not translate to \"Please burn the outside to a crisp, but leave raw meat in the center.\"  We considered sending it back, but well, given that we barely saw the waitress, and wanted to get out from Kid-Mageddon, I shared my sandwich and fries, and we got the hell out of there.\n\nI *might* go back when I'm in the area again, but only for a beer at the bar, and only if someone else is buying.  You are dead to me, MBC. Dead.\n\n~EEE~",

This coffee shop/eatery is located in midtown in an old building on First Capitol.  The ceiling is old with exposed duct work and the walls are brick.  I love old buildings that house businesses.  My personal favorite item here is the veggie wrap and it comes with a side of fruit.  Perfect!  Not too filling.  I also like the Thai peanut wrap.  For breakfast I like the Spin Veggie Sandwich with egg, mushrooms, feta and spinach served on a croissant.  The Breakfast Quesadillas are yummy too!   I really want to try the French toast because the syrup smells really good.  Don't forget to try the baked goods as well.  The blueberry scone is all I have to say.  \n\nThe coffee is fresh and the refills are free while you dine in and use the free WiFi.   The Iced Chai Latte is my favorite drink.  Get one!  If neither of those toot you whistle then they have have a variety of tea and smoothies.  The water is served from a neat contraption that fooled me at first, but once I figured it out I was on my way to hydration.  Crooked Tree is a really a well rounded coffee shop with great food and comfy atmosphere with inside and outside seating.  Go see for yourself.",

We had just finished at Big Lots, when we noticed Pit Stop Pub. On the Northwest cornor of Hillsborough Ave.  & Hanley Road is an L shaped strip mall where the pub is located.\nPit stop is an eclectic dive that comes complete with pool tables. As we entered, there was a sign outside saying it was ladies night and beer & wine were 50 % off. The establishment is rather long, narrow & dark. It is also quite smokey, I was glad they had the front door proper open.\nThe beer selection was adequate, but what these places do to wine is beyond my comprehension. Let me just say the wine is rough.\nI had not played pool in a few years and enjoyed relaxing and playing a few games, quite enjoyable. The place was fairly deserted and as an ex - smoker,  I had, had enough of the smokey filled atmosphere.\nI love dive bars, but am not quite as impressed with most dive pubs. I am sure we will be back to enjoy a few more games of pool & I may have to drink beer, the wine, just isn't for me.\nWhat's a girl to do?  You happen upon a new dive, have a bit of time, so you check it out!",

  "text": "I forking love this place.  It's a known fact that I have to take all of my new hires to this place because a) most of them have never had Thai (I was a Thai virgin previously myself), and b) what better place to go to on the Square than this?  I mean, don't get me wrong, I love me quite a few other restaurants, but when I think of Fountain Square, I think of Siam Square first!\n\nPaid Thai, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Thom Thom Soup, Drunken Noodles.  The exploration of food opportunities is endless!  I typically never venture far from my Pad Thai, but when I do, it's always fantabulous.\n\nHints to newbies:  Don't go on a Friday during lunch- super busy, and if you do, go at 11:30 or 2:00!!  Also, they have an upstairs area.  If going with a work group- request the upstairs as the downstairs is super loud and can be hard to have a 'work meeting' (wink wink).\n\nOther than that- I would LOVE to see a bar at this place.  That would definitely kick it up a notch, but even without the bar, it's my easy go to place in FS.",

  "text": "My feelings about my experiences with Daleng are very mixed. I'm willing to chalk that up to the fact that I've only done takeout, while most of the reviews and photos (which heightened my expectations) were based on eat-in experiences. \n\nThe pros: highly flavored, completely delicious on both entrees that I've tried, specifically the Eggplant and Veggie Curry and the Cambodian Stir Fry with Tofu. The sauce on the eggplant and veggie curry is so good that I could just pour that on a plate of brown rice and happily call it a meal. The tofu in the Cambodian Stir Fry is well prepared, there's lots of lemongrass, which I love, and the the vegetables in both are so thoroughly cooked that every bite is a melt-in-your-mouth party of tender vegetables, flavorful sauce and fluffy rice.\nThe service is friendly and quick, and for eat-in it looks like they have a good drink selection with really good prices. So I definitely want to have an eat-in experience here.\n\nThe not-so-pros: In spite of other reviews claiming the contrary here, the portion sizes are not really that generous. I feel like for the price, the portions might have been what you would expect for a lunch portion from a restaurant that was less \"takeout-esque\" (borrowing Karen X's brilliant wordplay there) than Daleng. They don't really pack the takeout containers, which is understandable because there's A LOT of sauce and it was spilling out even from the 3/4 filled containers. The amount of rice was a little harder to forgive though; the cup-sized cartons were only partially filled to the top, and there were gaps at the bottom of the container (so not even packed in). Again, probably not a problem if you were to do an eat-in meal, but not great for what I'd expect from a takeout carton of rice. When similar sized takeout containers from most places provide enough for two generous meals for me, and from here the containers provide about half of that, I can't help noticing.\n \nAll that said, I will almost definitely still be doing both takeout and eat-in here. My husband tried the vegetarian banh mi and was underwhelmed, so maybe I'll just stick to their stir fries (and gotta try the spring rolls too). That eggplant and vegetable curry will definitely be a permanent favorite.",

  "text": "Love this Museum. The displays are top notch and well done. As you walk in the lobby area is large with a theater and a grand staircase. This museum tells the story of the American Revolution. If I were you I would splurge for the audio system which gives you an in depth historical explanation of the life and times of what was happening. My one suggestion is to try to follow in order so you can get a chronological explanation of what you are seeing. When we went there was a large crowd of kids and to try to avoid the congestion we went to a different portion of the museum and we were a bit lost. Overall I would suggest this place as a \"must see\" when you travel to Philadelphia.",

The Stromboli, which in my opinion is one of the best sandwiches ever. It's on this bread that is like crusty yet soft, it's just amazing. And then of course the pizza!

I seriously don't understand how they could mess up items so simple like soups, salads, and sandwiches. I used to  go here a lot, but recently I feel like the service has gotten much worse and there always seems to be an error when I go through the drive thru. Also, one of the girls who is the cashier at the drive thru has been pretty rude with her attitude and facial expressions on more than one occasion.

  "text": "Located in a tiny room next to deVine Wines and Spirits, Tzin Wine and Tapas literally has enough room for seven two-top tables (two people per table). That, plus a short bar, plus a corner kitchen area, constitutes the entire restaurant.\n\nIt's quite dark inside, with tabletop candles and Spanish music playing in the background - perfect for a first date, a hundredth date, or drinks with close friends and co-workers. Not, on the other hand, a family-friendly restaurant; I wouldn't recommend bringing any children here.\n\nThe wine list was quite extensive, as I expected it to be, and offered a variety of by-the-glass choices, and just as many by-the-bottle options. I tasted two red wines during my visit: the Ben Marco Malbec, Argentina (hints of blackcurrant and slightly acidic) and the Pasion Brava Tempranillo (Rioja), Spain (much sweeter, very smooth drinking). No matter your wine preference, Tzin has a variety of options to suit every taste, and the excellent service ensures that your wine glass is always topped up.\n\nTzin offers a typical tapas-style menu: a selection of small-ish dishes with a strong foundation in Spanish cuisine. Diners can either select several to share amongst their party, or choose one or two for themselves. Everything (and I mean everything) sounded delicious, so it was difficult to make a decision.\n\nIn the end, I decided to try the Olive Plate to start, since I love pairing marinated olives with wine. Alongside the olives, the plate boasted a selection of focaccia bread, olive tapenade, and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, all of which were delectable. The warm marinated olives were delicious and went extremely well with my glass of Ben Marco.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to order separate dishes, and opted for the Chorizo and Gnocchi Stew and the Chicken Breast Supreme. The stew, served with grilled flat bread, was absolutely heavenly and had a weighty tomato taste that complemented the manchego gnocchi and chorizo exceptionally well. The chicken breast dish was moist and tender, and was served on a bed of harissa couscous and dried apricots, with a dollop of minted yoghurt. Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili sauce, so the couscous understandably had a bit of a kick to it; if you don't like spicy foods, I'd advise you not to choose this dish. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but it'll set your mouth tingling if you eat enough of the couscous.\n\nWe had excellent service throughout our entire visit - the server was very friendly and accommodating - and enjoyed the chic décor, open-style kitchen, and gigantic wine rack (my next purchase).\n\nOne of the things I like best about Tzin is that they're all about the dining experience. This restaurant is about relaxing, enjoying a good glass of wine, and sampling delicious appetizers and tapas plates. They're a hole-in-the-wall restaurant simply for this reason; if they were to enlarge the space and cram in as many tables as possible, they'd lose much of the charm they get from the currently intimate, personal dining experience. \n\nIf you work downtown, if you enjoy wine and tapas, or, hell...if you live in Edmonton...you need to make a date to visit Tzin sometime soon. As I've said, and as their website stresses, they're a small restaurant, so please make the most of OpenTable and book yourself a place. Then all you need to do is sit back, quaff some wine, nibble on an appetizer, and simply experience.",

I called a couple places with good Yelp! reviews, and The Lotus Room was the only one to accommodate, adding a slot in their schedule at the end of the day. I was so thankful for masseuse Victoria for extending her work day for me. \n\nThe building is off 18th Ave S, in a house-office building with single room offices which are mostly hair salons. There are a lot of these houses in the area and I love the eclectic mix of entrepreneurs who occupy them. Just drive through the alley to park behind the building and walk up the stairs to the second floor.\n\nAs soon as I laid down on the table, I was overtaken with relaxation. The full body massage was the perfect amount of pressure (medium-deep) and the room smelled wonderful. The buzz of the air conditioning unit did not even disturb me and the state I was in. I was offered an eye cover when I flipped over as it was sunset and there was still a bit of light in the room and it was perfect. \n\nI most certainly did not want it to be over when my hour was up.",

  "text": "If I were rating based on service, this would probably be a 4 or 5, but overall I don't think this is a must do in New Orleans. It's definitely an institution if you want to check it off your list, but for price and time, I'd probably prefer to check out other spots instead. We got the trio of soups to start (sampler of turtle, gumbo and soup du hour which was some vegetable soup for us). I think they were ok- but nothing memorable and honestly on the salty side. We both got fish dishes for our entree. I think my boyfriend's cast iron seared gulf fish was actually quite good- probably the best dish of the night. The pecan crusted fish was good, and supposedly one of their more popular, but I don't know if I'd order again. The desserts were actually pretty decent! My friend is obsessed with their creole bread pudding soufflé and may have raised our expectations too high...it was delicious and quite good! But not like mind blowing as he noted...but definitely worth a try if you're visiting the restaurant. The strawberry shortcake was actually my favorite between the two (we got both). I'll also say the cocktails were pretty decent and not too sweet. I got the sweet potato drink, which didn't taste much like sweet potato but reminded me a bit of a White Russian. Overall lovely staff and restaurant but not in my list of must-dos.",

  "text": "Update: after reading other reviews, I wanted to point out that I was NOT asked to leave a review. Or entering part of a raffle when doing this. This is truly a review I have been drafting since I moved in. I read horrible reviews and very few positive ones prior to moving in. I truly enjoyed my time here and want to leave a review that reflects that. \n\nThis may be my longest review yet so hold on!\n\nBefore I moved in:\nsuper easy website to navigate.  Liz was very friendly and helped out.  I was looking to move a few months out,  so I had time to do my research. \n (I was looking during Covid - May/ June 2020) Liz worked with me to schedule an apartment tour. She left the door open and let me help myself to the apartment that I could tour. I mean it's a place to live,  I was just looking that we had 4 walls up.  I LOVED the closet, and decided that day that this would be my home. \n\nApplication Process: \nOnce again,  the website made everything very user friendly. I filled out the application,  submitted previous rental history and was pretty much approved.  I applied for a 1/1, one of their \"older\" (non-renovated) apartments. \n\nMove in: \nPicking up keys in the front office was simple. I got the keys and moved in!  My dog was obsessed with the dog park.  \n\nFirst month: \nDuring move in,  I filled out paper work to have maintenance fix the bathtub strip, and they were out to my place within hours.  Honestly- impressed. \nI also had issues with our front door not locking.  Apparently another delivery vendor had the wires wrong.  The maintenance team came out 2 or 3 times until it was ultimately fixed. \nI loved my neighbors!  I had great neighbors who enjoyed my dog and were helpful when I did dumb things,  like leave my keys in my door one day! \nMy apartment building was fairly quiet. \nThe bad: some neighbors have dogs that bark ALL day and at any sound of movement.  (This is out of the offices control really). Luckily,  when your doors are closed,  you can barely hear your neighbors.\nInternet through AT&T was great,  you do have to go on your own,  but with the fiberoptic cabled internet- it was amazing. \n\nThe gym:\nIt's what you expect- a fitness center in an apartment complex.  I did use it when it was snowing outside and before I got my Y membership.  I was looking for a gym to swim in all year.  Otherwise,  it has a few weight machines,  treadmills,  bikes,  and free weights.\n\nThe dog park: \nIs great for my pup! He loves to go and really just runs around.  There are hoops to jump through and a tunnel.  My dog was more interested in other dogs and playing with the ball. \nThe bad:  some people don't pick up their dogs poop, which is a bummer at the park!  The gates also had issues,  eventually the back one was fixed with a zip tie. The front 2 are still difficult to shut\n\nPets:\nThis is a dog friendly apartment complex!  And almost everyone has dogs.  I like that they have poop bags available throughout the complex in case you forget yours.  The only two problems are the few people who do not pick up their poop & the dog owners who let their dogs off leash.\n\nParking:  easy,  always parking available. \nThe bad:  there is no security in place at all.  I had my catalytic converter cut out in the parking lot  I was also NOT the only one.  There were at least two other cars disabled for a couple months because of this.  I also heard of it happening to other people,  but didn't see their car disabled for long.  \nIt is not gated,  anyone can come in,  no security cameras. \n\nNeighbors:\nThere are kids from the next neighborhood over that come over often and drink and smash bottles in the parking lot.  It sucks because you never know what they are going to get into,  and my dog walks around and can step on the glass. Once again,  no real security here.\n\nTrash, I think pick up is on Mondays and Thursdays. With it being an apt complex, many other people come here to dump their stuff,  so I recommend taking out your trash on Mondays or Thursdays after it's picked up. \n\nWinter: \nThe Great: our sidewalks were always taken care of.  There was always a place to walk and it was great.  The roads had their moments,  and I think it may be a different group that comes in for the roads. I was amazed at how clean our sidewalks were after snowing for hours.\n\nPayment:\nI opted to use their app to pay.  There are different charges based on which route you go.  I liked being able to pay online whenever I wanted to.\n\nMail/ packages: \nI never had any issues with missing mail or packages. \n\nBonus: \nThe complex plays bingo for money off rent. They also host cute contests(seasonal / pet related). And really do some cool things for their residents.  \nCheckout:  will update soon!  I move out in a couple months. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this apartment complex to any one.  I really had a great experience and never had huge issues that weren't dealt with immediately.  I worked with Liz & Erin for multiple items and only had great interactions.",

  "text": "There is no better lunch option on a Friday than the Assumption Greek Orthodox Church Lunch.  Homemade Greek food with love.  Every Friday from 11 am- 2 pm, you can be sure to enjoy true Greek hospitality.  Drive to the very back of the parking lot and enter the white doors where you see a set of small stairs and a wheelchair ramp.  If it is your first time, there are plenty of people to point you in the right direction.\n\nThe church does an amazing job of posting their whole month's menu online.  They even have a downloadable copy for offices and groups that order together.  Take Out here is a breeze.  You can call the kitchen and place your pick up order directly or wait in line to see the options.  If you choose to eat at the location there are plenty of round tables filling the entire auditorium space.  \n\nOn my last visit, I was thrilled to order Lobster Bisque ($4.00), Spanakopitia ($3.00), Greek Salad ($5.00) and Dolmathes (2 for $3.00).  I had so much left over it made a second lunch.  Over the years, I have probably ordered almost everything.  Every Week they offer a Baked Fish option.  I have gotten the Baked Fish and served it for Dinner before.  Everything is boxed nicely and holds well.  The homemade soups never disappoint.  Once a month or so they sever Lamb Shank, expect longer lines on these days.\n\nYou do not have to wait for the once a year Greek Festival for fresh and flavorful Greek food.  Plan a visit to this West County hidden treasure soon.",

Wings were  not at all hot, but we're spot on as always. Great flavor  with some garlic and soy. Also got magma fries with bacon, cheese, scallions, and a side of ranch. Pure health food. ;-)) We were there on Bike Night, which I've loved for almost 20yrs. I'm glad I got to come here while on vacation. Our server, Jenny was EXCELLENT! I felt like Forrest Gump in the joint. She's quick, has a great memory, and excellent patience to put up with my questions and picky ordering. It was busy, bit she was rocking. It doesn't hurt that she's a knockout!",

Not great, a good meal of simple traditional tapas. Especially good for the restaurant week price I paid! \n\nwe had- \n-ham croquettes (good, but were cold when brought out to the table. probably because of the restaurant week factory assembling or some process going on but still) \n-cheese with lavender truffled honey (I'm not big on cheese so can't tell, but the honey was good! I was a little disappointed I couldn't taste the lavender) \n-shrimp (this was goooood. I wished there was more than 2!!) \n-pork sandwich (without this, I would've ended the meal hungry. Perfect texture, a faint mustard type taste, greens. delicious bread.) \n-cauliflower (very Mediterranean inspired. of course it was good, because how could grilled cauliflower taste bad?) \n-goat cheese (I didn't try this)\n-egg cream (a good decadent end to the meal. I loved the foam on top!) \n\nA bit of a mixed bag, as you can see from my comments! If I craved tapas and if it's restaurant week again I'd come back. Not sure I'd pay Amada's usual prices.",

Thanks Yelp!\n\nThe wine is everything you'd expect for the region, and then some. They also feature free hors d'oeuvres that compliment the wine, and the venue is very nice as well. The staff is quite lovely and super super friendly - there was a large party off to the right so they CAN accommodate parties if that's your thing.\n\nThey also feature smoothies for those that want to indulge in something fun and different, especially on those warm Summer days!\n\nIt's a must visit and it'll be a must returned visit, for me!\n\nTHIS has been a review by Gaurav",

The progression of my taste preference with ciders has really changed over the years and the dryness of the ciders at Hale & True is perfect for my taste now. Get the flight and figure out which ones you really like. The standard and the lil sunshine are my favorites. (If you're looking for a strongbow or angry orchard like cider you won't find it here)\n\nThey're a smaller location so there's only maybe 4 or so ciders offered on draft, wish there was more at a time but that's my only complaint.\n\nAside from the great ciders, it's an nice cozy atmosphere! We love going and ordering some nomad pizza from next door to enjoy with our ciders. That being said, all of the bartenders and waitstaff we've met have all been extremely accommodating.",

I love fish and chips, and, though, this wasn't the best I've had (I prefer Cod to their Haddock), it made the top 3 or 4. The SF dive bar Edinburgh Castle is my all time favorite with delivery from a nearby shop. The fries were perfect. The thickness of the fish pieces overpowered the batter. Otherwise, everything was great. Sides of mushy peas and pickled vegetables. Tea sandwiches of cheddar and tomato. With beverages, all under 30 bux. About 20 minutes from the city, it's worth a check out. Skip the stores and take a drive by tour of the beautiful houses. \n\nThey also serve brunch. The menu was extensive. \nYou can also dine on the sidewalk. I believe that's called al fresco. \nAnd they don't serve Coca-Cola. Strictly British sodas. \nTheir logo is pretty sweet, too.",

Its history, its intimate setting, its obscure location.... all adding to the appeal. \n\nGetting tickets online is a cluster, but not getting tickets in advance is a bigger cluster, or should I say huge line with limited chance of making it inside. We had three of us, and online ticketing split us into the tables. No biggie but not ideal. \n\nWe arrived 40 minutes before the show and the staff was frazzled and not friendly. I am docking a star for that. It's intimate and they seat 75 guests for two nightly shows. Most of which are preassigned online. So why are you frazzled and short with us?\n\nWe ended up in the very back at a high top; the only seat that they don't have a waitress assigned to. Also annoying but the bar was close.\n\nNow....onto the good stuff! The place is so cute and even in the far back, it was so intimate and enjoyable to see such talent on stage. It is clear that those on stage appreciate the Bluebird. As an audience member, being able to hear their music and stories in a lovely acoustic setting is very unique. I love live music and many genres, however \"newer\" pop-country is not one of them. The band we saw was a male/female country duo called Sons of Daughters. Because it was acoustic, it felt less country-ish...and I really enjoyed them! The male lead especially! I'm always rooting on these musicians working to really make it. \n\nOverall, the music and intimacy was excellent! And that helped ensure that the unsteady service didn't sour my long awaited night at the Bluebird!",

The breading was just right--enough to add some flavor, not too much so as to be heavy. I forget what my s/o ordered, but I do remember clearly that he thought the coffee was exemplary, so another point in their book!\n\nThe only reason this place wasn't a 5-star was because we had some miscommunications with our waiter.

The server just seemed confused the whole time like as if it was her first day. \n\nI ordered the falafel appetizer for my meal with a side of rice. I specifically told the server I wanted it as my meal so that everything would hit the table along with my hubby's meal too. Hubby ordered the lamb gyro plate and he chose to have it with hummus instead of salad (came with the plate). My falafel came first and I had to wait about 7 minutes before my rice and hubby's plate came out. We had to ask for utensils. My falafel was hard on the outside but soft on the inside. The rice was very flavorful. Hubby lamb gyro... wow... was so juicy and amazing! After enjoying a couple of bites we realized that we hadn't gotten his hummus yet so we asked our server. She said hummus didn't come with the plate and she'd ask the back (?) when she herself asked at the time our order was taken if my hubby wanted hummus or salad. She disappeared, walked around the restaurant, cleaned another table and then opened a menu and read the plate section. She came back and stated that hummus did come with the plate (but we already knew this....) and we asked for it again. It was worth the wait. I LOVE their hummus.\n\nAnyhow despite the service being pretty sad, the food will still call us back another time.",

Which I often like soft pizza crusts but on a calzone the texture was weird - I expected it to be more crisp.

It should pop up via a hologram right inside the door, singing about how diners should beware instead of throwing themselves upon the rocks of terrible food. \n\nI will admit that I was a little wigged out by the reviews of my old favorite, the Midtown II. I thought, \"Maybe my beloved Midtown II has gone downhill since I lived in Philly. Maybe I shouldn't take my sweet lover to a bad restaurant.\" AH HAHAHAHAHAHA. No. In my fear of taking my lover to have a bad meal, I took him to have a bad meal. \n\nThe fact that the diner was completely empty at dinner hour should be a tip. \nSecond tip: the kitchen had the griddle turned off halfway through dinner hours. \nThird tip: the server was deep in a Russian novel, and she admitted to just starting it two hours ago. (I asked. I like Russian novels, okay?) \n\nNot to belabor this point, but Yelp, it was bad. My partner ordered the only good thing on the menu. He got the seasonal vegetable salad, which had this lovely warm dressing and fresh squash mixed in with the usual salad fixings. Even the coke was flat and a little weak. Ouch. \n\nNo point hammering on about a bad meal. I'm sad we ate here when the city has better to offer. \n\nAccessibility notes: no Braille menu or signage. Plenty of space for mobility devices.

My husband was so proud that he \"found\" this place, and I was happy to oblige in trying something new!  \n\nWe actually walked over from the Wine Cellar at Lambertville Station, it is super walkable (~7 mins). Anyways, once we walked in, we immediately knew we found our new favorite restaurant. The smells of the food were intense and super fragrant. The restaurant is a no-frills basic room, yet intimate and charming. Copper tables dotted the space in various configuration of 2's, 4's and even a party of 6.  Antique middle eastern lights hung from the ceiling in various colors, proving just enough light to see, with tea candles flickering on each table for a pinch of romanticism.  You can see into the kitchen vaguely, and get the sense that it's only a couple people back there, doing what they do best. \n\nThe menu is surprisingly large. So many options ranging from Zatter bread & babaghannough to gyros, Koshari, and Egyptian samosas - it was hard to choose! We settled on sharing 3 things, and made a deal on what we'll order the next time we dine (gyros, hummus, and Ouzi, for the record).  \n\nTo start we ordered babaghannough, which was sublime. Their menu described it as \"eggplant dip will be the best you ever had\" and, I gotta say, it was! The \"generous dose of garlic\" definitely tickled our tastebuds, but we're complete garlic lovers so it was right up our alley. Plus, the pita was served warm, always a good touch!\n\nFor our meal, we shared a salad with shrimp and kofta. Honestly the salad was \"fine\", totally good and shrimp was flavored well, but, it got lost in comparison to the kofta, that I hardly touched it.  \n\nThe kofta; omg. First of all, the meat itself was so packed with flavor that my taste buds were practically dancing! It was served with tahini and toumeaa (a garlic sauce); both of which were unlike anything I've tasted before.  They doctored up their tahini - it was bright and flavorful, almost zesty.  The toumeaa was unreal - the words \"that's money\" from a certain flame-wearing diner-visiting chef popped into my mind. It was like a kick in the pants, for my tastebuds - SO unbelievably garlicky, yet somehow I couldn't get enough.  The dish was served with yummy long grain rice, which I happily used to shovel more toumeaa into my mouth.  Let's just say, it's a good thing we both were eating the same thing - otherwise I would have had some SERIOUS garlic breath issues (I mean, I still had it - but at least we both did!)\n\nThe server was super friendly and hospitable, prompt without being pushy, but left us alone just the right amount! I legitimately cannot wait to go back and try more of this menu!!!\n\n::Heads up, no reservations unless you have a party of 6+. You can do call ahead seating! We came around 9pm on Saturday and we're seated immediately, but the place was really full.\n:: BYOB! Wahoo!",

I am saving up for a pellet bbq.  Prices look pretty reasonable.  I have also bought lamp shades, screen doors, paint, electrical fixtures and have looked at the flooring there.  You name it, they've got it.  Home Deport is my \"go to\" place when I need to spruce up the house.",

  "text": "Butcher and is definitely the best steakhouse I have been to in Philadelphia. The ambiance and the decoration is amazing. The hostesses weren't great. They didn't come to check on us and make sure our party was there when it was time for us to be seated like they did for others waiting at the bar. So I had to walk over and check with them.\n\nAfter that the the rest of the evening was pretty flawless. Me hike the restaurant week menu was limited, everything was still expertly prepared. The oysters Rockefeller and the potato leek soup were both delicious. I loved the sear on my filet. The crust was exactly what I look for in my steaks. The salmon was all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Dessert might have even been the best course. The chocolate and caramel tart an the bread pudding were flawless.\n\nI want to go back sometime soon to have the Delmonico steak with a side of stuffed hash browns and the baked Alaska for dessert. I have had many people raving to me about these items, so hopefully I can go back soon and try them out!",

  "text": "I recently went back to Rodizio Grill for a Yelp event, and I realized that I wasn't on Yelp back in 2013 when I first visited.  I did, however, blog about the experience, so I'm including that recap here, plus updates based on my visit this week (2016) below.\n\n---2013 at Nashville's Rodizio---\nOne of my boyfriend's most favorite things in the whole wide world to eat is picanha, a Brazilian rump cap beef cut rubbed in butter and sea salt and cook on a spit.  Yes, it is as phenomenal as it sounds.\n\nThat is why he loves Brazilian steakhouses with all-you-can-eat concepts.  Since we weren't spending Thanksgiving together this year, we decided our \"Couplesgiving\" meal would be at the Rodizio Grill in downtown Nashville.  A win for me with no cooking required, and a win for boyfriend and his carnivorous cravings!  We took advantage of an e-mail we got that gave us a Buy One, Get One Half Off deal on our meal.  (Just sign up for e-mails on the website!)\n\nWe've never been to Rodizio before, but we have visited similar concepts.  I think Rodizio does an excellent job!  We were surprised by the price, which was about $10 less than other churrascaria chains we've been to.  We were seated right away, and we had very attentive service.  The only thing not included in your meal price is drinks and dessert.\n\nThey start you with a few appetizers, like tasty fried bananas and even polenta.  The \"salad bar\" (which is way more than just salad) was well-stocked, and enormous!  Everything from rice and soups to quail eggs and mozzarella salad.  I think a vegetarian could go to town on the variety offered.  They had four full sides of options on that buffet.\n\nWe put the \"green\" signal up when we were ready, and then we went to town.  The picanha guy knew that was our absolute favorite, so he gave us as much as we wanted whenever he came by.  We were pitched sausage, ham, brisket, lamb, fish, chicken, turkey, and even a DELICIOUS grilled pineapple.  Yum.\n\nWhen you need the meat to stop coming, you just put the red signal up and they leave you alone.  But then you spot something juicy coming by and you're like, GREEN!  Let's just say we ate our fill.\n\n---2016 at Nashville's Rodizio---\nNow that boyfriend is my husband!  And he went back with me for a Yelp event and we loved it even more.   The picanha and grilled pineapple are still amazing, but I've noticed that they've added even MORE to the mix.  \n\nThere are some new additions to the buffet, which now boasts more than four sides with an additional line of food on the side.  There's an incredible macaroni and cheese and new meats (ribs!) that bring Tennessee flavors into the mix.  We learned the word \"Rodizio\" isn't synonymous with a churrascaria, but is more about eating in the round.  Brazilian food incorporates many cultures in its fusion and influence, so I think it's only fitting that Tennessee flavors (including local cheesecake) sneak their way into this place on 2nd Ave spot.\n\nWe also had a chance to start the meal with a Pinga con Mel shot (that honey rim is great!) and sample the caipirinhas.  We finished the meal with a deliciously smooth Amarula shot, which I recommend.  I had two.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our time at the restaurant, including the hospitality of the staff and gauchos.  Loved it.  We will be back to feast again.\n\nP.S.  There's an event space in the back, that I think would be great for corporate meetings, receptions, etc.  Love the exposed brick, private bar, etc.",

  "text": "Mahalo, Honu! What an incredible lunch we had with you on a September Saturday in 2021! We sat out back in the peaceful and relaxing tiki bar area. With the lush vegetation, vintage Polynesian-inspired decor, the tropical menu and the staff's warm and friendly vibe, it truly felt like we were far away on vacation... and that was before we started sampling the inventive craft cocktails. \n\nOpened in 2016, the restaurant is in a little green house, in downtown Dunedin, with a patio out front and the tiki bar out back. Inside, there's a lobby/front room area with a deep mid-century Polynesian vibe and a 20-seat private dining room. \n\nOut back, there's a large bar area, separate long counter seating and several tables with umbrellas. We were seated right away... and the four-legged member of our party was happily fawned over. They brought water to our good boy several times and there's even a dog menu! The rest of us ordered chicken sliders, a burger, one of the stacks and the coconut lime soup. Everyone loved everything! We also thoroughly enjoyed tropical drinks and a couple of champagne flights. They didn't mind us lingering three hours at the table. What a fun, chill and unique afternoon! I can't wait to go back and keep working my way through both the food and extensive drink menus... and take in some live music. \n (there's a little stage in the tiki bar area)\n\nThere's parking available along nearby streets plus a small lot. Service was warm, friendly and easy-going and everything was just so comfy. It's good for head, heart and tummy. See you there!",

We were happy to see a location was opening in The Grove which is very convenient for us. We called in our order which was taken promptly over the phone by a very friendly girl. My husband went to pick it up 20 minutes later and the restaurant was pretty busy. He was frustrated that there wasn't a designated pick up area since there was a long line at the register and the bar area was full as well. He waited in line to pick up our food which was ready for us and delicious! We had the Five-O and the Roasty Toasty with added feta. Just need a designated area for pick up to make it more efficient.",

  "text": "My childhood is filled with memories of enjoying the annual Philadelphia Flower Show and then walking to Vietnam for some lunch/dinner with my family.  This has happened more times than I can count, and each time its been wonderful.  It may not be the typical family tradition, but it's mine and I love it.  \n\nEven now that I live in CO, any opportunity I have to come back to Vietnam is an exciting day indeed.\n\nI've been to Vietnam more times than I can count and two things are guaranteed, my Mom and I order the Flaming Volcano for two, and the table shares the BBQ Platter.  If this is all you eat and drink at Vietnam you'll be in heaven.\n\nThe Flaming Volcano for two includes rum, vodka, gin, brandy, grenadine, Bacardi 151 and fruit juice.  This is a boozy beverage and will leave two people feeling the buzz as they suck down every drop.  And don't let them take the drink too soon, as the ice melts and mixes with the remaining booze and juice you can have a \"second drink\".  Don't forgot to blow out the flame and drink the rum from the center, it's a warm burn as it makes it's way slowly down your throat.  \n\nThe BBQ Platter includes, crispy spring rolls, beef stuffed grape leaves, char-grilled chicken, grilled meat balls, rice vermicelli, lettuce, and rice paper sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  They say this serves two people but I think this easily serves four to five people, especially if you're ordering entrees.  The crispy spring rolls are those addicting spring rolls that you dream about.  If I was on a desert island and could only have three things, I would want these spring rolls to be one of the three items.  In addition to the spring rolls, the grilled meatballs are delicious and I love taking the lettuce or the rice paper and making a wrap with the rice vermicelli, char-grilled chicken, pickled vegetables and topping the whole thing with some peanut sauce.  The BBQ Platter will feed the table and people will fight over the last bites.\n\nI've tried multiple entree items and they have all been good, but nothing has the variety that the BBQ Platter offers.  The BBQ Platter gives you multiple items and a mixture of tastes that a single entree cannot offer.  Take my word for it, order the BBQ Platter!  And if you're feeling a bit crazy, the Flaming Volcano for two is the perfect accompaniment.",

The food is reasonable and the quality is good. They have TVs and a big bar for people to sit and watch the games/news/whatever is on. \n\nI had the burger, and it was good. Sometimes, a simple burger and fries is all that is needed to make your world happy again. My friend had seafood something, since she only sticks with fish. She also loved her food. I would definitely return here; it is to me somewhat of a hidden gem. I can definitely understand some reviews about rude / rushing bartenders, tho. She was curt but somewhat friendly when we ordered. Maybe that is just their brand? Not sure. I was just friendly and smiled and she seemed fine with me.",

No matter the crowd, the line you'll encounter upon entering always moves fairly quickly, and the staff is helpful, efficient and friendly. It's like they hired die-hard Saints fans to staff the place and they're as excited as the Saints are in the house as we are. Visiting Champions Square pre-game can be fun.\n\nMy one criticism about our Dome is that the food quality doesn't really represent New Orleans. I don't expect to get the best of what we have to offer in a sports arena, but they could do better. I've noticed this season they got on board with Ochsners's Get Fit NOLA program, although I haven't tried the menu, so can't comment on the quality, and you can get top shelf mixed drinks at kiosks on the 200 level; it'll cost you, but if you're looking for a good hand made margarita, Bloody Mary or Old Fashioned, they got that. The club level food is sub par for our city, and, since we have so many visitors here every year, I wish they'd think about really bringing it. I usually go out for brunch ahead of the game and avoid the food altogether. \n\nBring some extra green for the Team Fan Shop on level 100; this store will not disappoint. And when we get a little loud and chant \"Who Dat!?!\" In your faces, you'll forgive us, right?",

She was so worn out the rest of the day. But next time we go, it will be when it's not so windy and the waves are smaller.

It was earthy, so I would say cumin.\n\nMy girlfriend's porto fries were Portobello mushrooms cut like steak fries, breaded and deep-fried.

  "text": "I am absolutely loving Rebar Coffee. Matt Christianson, the brain behind Union Ale and American Ale, has hit it out of the park with this adorable cafe. \n\nRebar serves delicious drip coffee, lattes, and cold brew. They have an assortment of bottled, cold beverages, as well as, local beer and wine. They also offer fresh squeezed orange and tomato juices. \n\nOn a hot day, I usually opt for the cold brew. It is rich, bold and tasty! When I'm looking to warm up, I tend to order an Almond Milk Latte - sooo good! Or an Almond Milk Vanilla Latte, made with a touch of their house made Vanilla Bean Syrup. I am so delighted that they make their syrups in house rather than using the ordinary Torani brand syrups. \n\nRebar offers breakfast daily, fresh baked pastries and lunch items including massive, gourmet burgers with fries, pizzas and salads. \n\nI've had the Sticky Bun multiple times and it is the dessert sweet dreams are made of! Imagine a cinnamon bun but better, doughy on the inside, crispy, perfectly caramelized crust on the outside, topped with candied nuts and a sauce that trickles down the outside ridges of the crust, mmmm good! \n\nI also highly recommend the Ricotta toast which consists of an extra thick slice of fresh baked bread, topped with a generous slather of hand pulled ricotta cheese and finished off with a layer of jam of your choice (Blueberry Strawberry, Strawberry Rhubarb, Peach or Honey). I had it with Strawberry Rhubarb and it was fantastic! Not too sweet and very filling. It could be a light meal on it's own or order one to share as a little amuse bouche for your table. \n\nThe Avocado Bacon & Egg Sandwich is definitely worth a mention as well. House made Brioche bun, baked to golden perfection, sandwiching a fried egg over medium, several slices of thick, smokey bacon, smashed fresh avocado and topped with diced chives. The sandwich comes with a Chipotle Ketchup that I've heard is wonderful, however, I love a combination of sweet and savory for breakfast so I substitute the ketchup for house made jam, usually Strawberry Rhubarb. It's heavenly! If you've ever had the breakfast sandwich at Renaud's, this is reminiscent of that (only slightly different ingredients), and served with a much better bread in my opinion, because the brioche does not tear up my gums like the bread at Renaud's does. Just try it, it's worth it!\n\nIt would not be a complete review without mentioning the ambiance, decor, location and music. Rebar feels like a respite from the hustle and bustle of State Street, even though it's located right on it. Walking into Rebar is like stepping back in time to the Prohibition-Era. Natural wood, metal and steel accents, the greatest jazz humming through unseen speakers and beautiful large windows to people watch. \n\nThere is also a huge, dog friendly outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables. They'll even bring a water bowl for your pooch(es). I know because I've brought my two loves. ;) \n\nThe staff is warm and friendly. They all seem very well-trained. There is free wifi, password: 214union. \n\nParking is easy in their lot adjacent to Rebar, or if necessary, you can park across the street in the Amtrak lot where the first 75 mins are free.\n\nThe only note I have of constructive feedback is regarding the bathrooms, which are located next to the patio and across from the kitchen doors. They are often dirty and need regular attention. I suggest having an hourly or bi-hourly schedule for the staff to check the bathrooms and do any clean up necessary. It is very off putting when a bathroom is in disgusting condition at a restaurant because it gives off a vibe of uncleanliness. Something I would not associated with my restaurant if I owned one. Other than that, I'd say Rebar is close to perfect for a little cafe.",

  "text": "I really wanted to love this place.  The place is the former Warsaw Cafe location and is super cute on the inside and out.  The service was a bit slow, but the owner/waiter/food runner was extremely friendly.  The restaurant was relatively full but they only had 1 waitress and the owner who functioned as a waiter/food runner.  I heard the owner telling someone that his wife makes all the food and she only makes one dish at a time...which doesn't seem like the best idea.  This may also explain why the food didn't come out piping hot.\n\nAppetizers: Fried tofu- good, but could have been crispier.  Thai papaya salad was pretty good as were the thai basil meatlballs, but I felt like it could have used some kind of dipping sauce or something since they were a bit dry.\n\nEntrees: Pad Thai- super super al dente.  Some of the noodles were basically uncooked and the pad thai was a bit dry.  My friend got the panaeng curry with duck which was actually delicious.  \n\nI will probably give this place another try.  It is relatively new so perhaps they need some time to work out some things.",

Did I mention the fact that the espresso was literally ON FIRE hot? oh I didn't? well it was. and that made me quite sad. I have always been curious about the good karma up on 22nd, passing it constantly when driving over to see the West Philly folks. I've never had reason to stop because I was always headed somewhere, however, when this one opening up so close to my house, it was clear I could take it in for consideration. \n\nI stopped by on a walk with my dog and bf. They let me bring the dog in- massive props. The space is really lovely. It's got great high ceilings, lots of sitting room, (but all tables and chairs like a cafeteria, no cushy seating) They are open late, which is nice, but still, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. If I leave my house and walk south instead of north, I end up at Chapterhouse, and while GK is certainly nice, I also need my beverage to be on par with the aesthetics of the place, and at least at my first visit, it was not. It burnt my mouth and was 3/4 foam and 1/4 espresso and not a latte in any form of the word. \n\nI'm sure we'll try it again and at that point, I'll give it a second chance and second review, but for right now it would be my last choice for a coffee fix. Sorry guys.",

The Thanksgiving weekend caused for it to be a not so packed evening - great for our benefit, our party of four was easily able to find a table.\n\nLoved the woody atmosphere, the great attitude of all the employees, and most importantly the menu! Rincon carries a variety of their house beers, as well as guest beers or Coors Light (lol). I had the IPA and LOVED it. Different than the Sonoma County IPAs I've been used to lately, but so fresh and delicious.\n\nThe table shared pretzel bites with a beer jalapeño cheese dip.... YUM. The only bad thing about it was there wasn't enough! I could've eaten it all on my own and I had to share... ugh! Luckily we also had the sriracha hot wings, enough for each of us to have 3, and so good and perfectly spicy!!\n\nI can't wait to go back to Carp to not only visit my friends, but to go back here!

I grew up going to shoprite in jersey and I was pleasantly surprised to find out this was the closest supermarket to my new home. This location is pretty clean and well maintained. Prices here are generally good and they offer decent perks to card holders, like a free ham or turkey for $400 spent during the 6 weeks before Thanksgiving. After getting all my deli meats at BJ's the past 4 years, I can't say I love these prices, but it's comparable to most supermarkets deli prices. Not the biggest store but a good selection.

  "text": "I know FOR A FACT that I will be eating at this place way more than I \"should.\" \n\nI just moved in a mere block away from this excellent spot, and discovered it's epic happy hour last week. \n\nBlown-away isn't even the right terminology. I just moved back to Saint Louis from California, land of top-notch fresh fish BUT inflated pricing. Cafe Mochi didn't fail to disappoint in any way - taste or otherwise. (Granted, I was there for happy hour, but whatever...they have it from 4:30-6:30 Tuesday-Friday and that's AWESOME in my book.) The two of us ate VERY well and walked away with full bellies on five rolls. Our total pre-tip was around $16. That is crazy-fantastic!\n\nAs far as the rolls we divulged in: we immediately chose the Bagel Roll because it sounded all kinds of deliciously unhealthy. I don't really remember what was in it, but it was one of those fried rolls that also has cream cheese in it. It was good, but very....creamy and filling. We also got a tempura asparagus roll (because we're primarily veggies and had to see what this place had to offer the full-blown sect) that was very good. The Futomaki roll tasted \"healthy,\"  but it was a great balance to the fried goodness of everything else. I think we may have also gotten a fried shrimp roll, though by this point I can't remember if it was fried or not. I do know one of the rolls had avocado and it was -awesome-. Our favorite was the Spicy Octopus roll. Seriously, words cannot describe the tasty tango happening in my mouth. Chewy, but zingy - loved it!\n\nWe didn't get anything to drink, but we were being cheap and that's how it goes. I don't know how  \"all about it\" I'd be if I were paying full price, but the happy hour option is always available. \n\nWhen we first got there, service seemed a bit lackluster, but I don't remember getting angry about lack of water or anything at all throughout the meal. The decor is cute, but a little weird, considering they have lawn furniture inside for some of the tables. I like the pink, though. Pink is fun. The spray-painted chandeliers are a nice bonus. \n\nI know we'll come here way more than we expected when we first walked in. This isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but I've had a lot of sushi all over the world and I wouldn't expect St. Louis to fulfill all of that. However, this place is great and I didn't question the quality of the fish that we ordered at all. I have no idea how they manage to support the business with such a killer deal, but I will attend this fantastic mess until the end of my tenure on South Grand or they stop offering it - whichever comes first.",

  "text": "I really wanted to love Hillbilly BBQ, I don't want to say I didn't like it but, I'm not sure it was love at first bite either.  I'd give it THREE &  HALF STARS if I could.\n\nTo do the fair review I felt like I bought the joint out.  I ordered a combo (beef & pork with two sides) along with a couple of ribs and a couple more sides.\n\nFirst, the staff was very friendly and helpful.  When torn between the traditional BBQ sauce & sweet sauce he put two pieces of beef on a slice of wax paper and handed me both bottles of sauce.  Both were good (and I took both).  On a side note, he did tell me they are moving to Hickory and I think there might be a temporary move between where they are now and Hickory...so if you are going to try this place CALL AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED!\n\nOn to the food.  The beef was good...maybe a little on the dry side.  The pork I thought was better than the beef, the ribs (the dry type) were ok, not a ton of meat on the one I ate and it did have a good bit of fat on it.  I thought the meat was very smokey.  I like smokey but, I like to actually taste the meat too.  If I had to rank the meats I tried I'd say the pork was best, followed by the beef and then the ribs.\n\nThe sides I ordered were corn salad, potato salad, baked beans & slaw.  The corn salad wasn't what I was expecting...I was thinking more along the lines of the corn stuff from Voodoo BBQ (which I love!) and this was a cold corn salad with tomatoes and a little kick...it was good.  The potato salad really had some kick...it was good.  The beans were ok.  The slaw was not creamy like most places but, I think it was a vinegar based...good stuff.  I think those were their four normal sides.  \n\nOne thing I have to stay about everything was it all had a lot of Cajuny (I'm making up words now) kick to it.  Sometimes I think places can go a little too far with the Cajun seasoning...this might be the case here.  I don't own any Tony Chachere's and it's really not something I want to taste when I'm going out.  Just my personal taste here.\n\nOverall, I'd try it again.  I wanted this to be my \"go to\" BBQ place and it isn't it.  I know a lot of people don't like Voodoo BBQ but, I do it because it isn't overly smoked and always solid (I thought The Joint was a little too smokey too).  I think Hillbilly BBQ was good and I'd try it again but it's not my #1 BBQ place.  \n\nI'd give it THREE AND A HALF STARS if I could.",

  "text": "I had the lucky opportunity to try Marrow out for the first time the other day during our NYE progressive dinner in Fountain Square. I had heard nothing but lovely things about Marrow and it had been bookmarked for quite awhile. So, I had high hopes! And I was not disappointed.\n\nWe started with drinks and I opted for their Miso Mule, which was filled with mogul vodka, coconut-miso reduction, lime, ginger syrup and soda. I've always been a fan of Moscow Mules, so I knew I was in for a treat with this one. Delightful. They also had several great beers on tap which several of the people at my table took advantage of and they all seemed very pleased. We then moved on to the food - which, to be honest, I at first found a little daunting because a lot of the options were brand new to me and my taste buds. I view this place as a restaurant for those that are open to trying new things - I mean, this food was quality food. Just new to me. \n\nBecause it was NYE, it seemed appropriate to take a shot! So we landed on their Oyster Shooters - oysters and champagne migonette. We were all pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed it. It was hard to not order another round - my recommendation is to just go ahead and order that other round. ha \n\nOne of my favorite dishes we decided on was their Gnocchi - butternut squash, oyster mushrooms, brussels sprouts, sage brown butter, truffled parsnip puree and parm. I couldn't get enough of it! \n\nIt was fun to experience these new dishes with this particular group as each and every one of us were down to try something new. I was fortunate that I was sitting with others that had been there before - so they could give their own personal recommendations before ordering. \n\nThis is definitely a nice addition to Fountain Square and I'm VERY glad I finally was able to check it out.",

I remember driving up and seeing an old, strange looking building with \"Babe's\" written on the outside of it.  Um, just exactly where are we going?  Once I had a bite of this pizza I was a believer.  The double decker pizza is unlike any other pizza I've ever had.  Imagine a pizza on top of a pizza with gooey, delicious cheese and sauce crammed into most of the crust.  We order ours with extra sauce to make it even better!  You'll be surprised at how few slices it takes to make you really full!  While you're eating your pizza you can watch the model train that circles the entire length of the dining room.  I love supporting local businesses like this.  Babe's make it easy because the owners/workers are SO nice and the pizza is SO good.  If you're coming here on a Friday or Saturday night I would suggest arriving early because this place gets packed on the weekends.\n\nProtip: Babe's has a very small parking lot.  They are located behind an Einstein Bagel.  You are allowed to park in the Einstein parking lot.  Einstein is only open during the day and Babe's is only open at night.

She loved her crab; said it was fantastic and full of flavor.\nHer thoughts on the service was the same as my opinion. We both had been checked on 6 times before our food even came out, (which was 40 minutes). It was not busy at all, and it was way to many times to check on us before our food was even there. \n\nI had the crab cakes with cole slaw. The cole slaw was better than the crab cakes. The cakes lacked flavor. I tried putting lemon on them to spruce them up, but it didn't really work. I was very hungry so I just ate the crab cakes and ordered a brownie after wards. The ice cream on the brownie was nice and creamy.\nSo apart from the over-bearing service and the mediocre crab cakes, I will return to try the scallop dinner, and so my girlfriend can have the awesome snow crab dinner again!",

They have the biggest variety of toppings out of all the frozen yogurt shop I tried in Indy, and it's usually pretty fresh.  \n\nMy only complaint about this place is the original flavor, sometimes it's very bland and sour.  I love the tart original flavor but at Yogokiss it's just straight up sour sometimes.  I usually have to ask for a sample to see if they got their original flavor right that day.  They have a really great thing going on here and deserve a visit from all you fro-yo lovers out there.  The texture of their yogurt is just wonderful...creamy and perfectly frozen.  A great treat even on a cold winter day!",

  "text": "I had a great experience here! Yes, the space is tiny, but the atmosphere, service, and food were awesome!\n\nWe went before a Pacers game during Devour Downtown, and their deal was incredible! It was 2 people for $30, which included an appetizer, massive entree, and dessert. The drinks were also reasonably priced. \n\nWe started off with this chorizo/queso appetizer dip that was very tasty. I am a big chorizo fan and I love dips, so this was the perfect combination. \n\nWe didn't have an option for the entree, they just brought this massive tray out with 4 kinds of meats, and any type of taco ingredient that we could have wanted. I enjoyed the customizable aspect of it. Churros were the dessert, and they were good. \n\nThis small preview made me want to come back and try other things! they had college basketball on the tvs and you could probably get a max group of 6-8. I also saw that the owners also own BBQ and bourbon which i will have to try out soon.",

  "text": "I've been dying to try this place for a couple of years now.  My family loves biscuits and gravy and biscuit sandwiches, so this place was bound to have something for everyone in our family and it did!\nWe ordered online to go since we're a big group and it's a small place, but there were a few booths that could have accommodated our family of 7.  There was a decent amount of outdoor seating as well.\n2 of my kids got the Reggie and it was great - awesome biscuits, flavorful chicken, great gravy.  My daughter who had the Chatfield felt the apple butter was too sweet for the sandwich, but liked the rest of the sandwich.  My wife really liked her club sandwich.\nOne of my all-time favorite dishes is shrimp and grits, so I had to get that (knowing my kids wouldn't finish their biscuit sandwiches and I'd be able to try theirs too!).  The grits were creamy without being too heavy and I really enjoyed the shrimp, bacon, and onion mixture on the top - good flavor to go with the creamy grits!\nWe tried the beignets for dessert and liked the caramel sauce, but prefer a lighter beignet dough rather than the biscuit dough.\nDefinitely would come again for brunch in the future - especially on a nice day when we could eat outside!",

  "text": "Agno is a great addition to the Rittenhouse lunch options (although, they've been around about a year now, so the secret should be out!). It's so fast, so it's worth the walk from my building, because I'd rather spend my time outside and eating than waiting in line.\n\nThis is fast-casual eatery, meaning it's a build-a-x (bowl, wrap, or salad) place. It's completely gluten-free, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it, and I think everything is tasty, and the vegan options are well marked.\n\nMy go-to is generally a rice bowl with falafel (it tastes a little healthy, but otherwise pretty good) and the toppings are great -- love the carrots, beets, cabbage ... well, all of the vegan ones for sure.\n\nThere's also plenty of seating, so it's fine to bring a couple of friends along for lunch, no competition over just a couple tables like other Rittenhouse lunch spots!",

We've had a membership since they've opened and love the convenience and cost of the service. We use to bath our dogs on a weekly basis ourselves which took about 30-45 mins with each dog (wash and dry) and now we've gained that time back in our lives for a minimal cost. BarkSuds is a Godsend and not sure how we survived without it. Also, the cost of the cuts are very affordable as comparison with other local rates. We are definitely happy customers!!!",

  "text": "This is really a 3.5 review but no halfsies and I mulled over it a while but just couldn't go with 4. \n\nThat being said I really really wanted to love this place, it's close, it's brunch, new, ample parking. So you walk in they are pretty friendly, they have a \"bar\" but no drinks... Tea, coffee, it's cute but lacking. Note this is not a byob either.  What is also nice in the waiting area they have self serve coffee/tea while you wait. It is extremely bright inside, which is a bit much. The staff is pretty nice from the front desk to the servers.  I didn't like the fact that they were swiffer-vacuuming while I was eating.   \n \nOn to food, to I ordered the NY pastrami omelette, it was good, but I probably did the place an injustice by doing so since there is a near by diner that has one that I am in love with.  It didn't measure up.  I will say the food was very fresh, kind of a silver diner feel.  But I didn't really see any real brunch options, nothing that wowed me.  I also had one of their hot chocolate specials that I was sure was going to be a slam dunk, I went with my servers recommendation, I got the smore's , the concept was great, the first few sips were amazing, but no way I could finish it, I was on sugar overload.  Nothing was bad, it was just ok at best good.  I will likely try them again, I mean they are so close and more importantly right next door to the massage spot.  Hopefully I can update to a 4 star review, but as for now it is what it is.",

We were greeted warmly and shown our table. Our server Sara was delightful, knowledgeable, and not afraid to share her real opinions on their food and wine. The salad of the day was fresh (they grow their own vegetables in a hot house around the corner on another of their properties). The food was inventive and delicious! We had Grilled Salmon on a bed of garbanzo, sun dried tomatoes, jalapenos, mint, and creme fraiche. My wife doesn't usually like salmon and loved it. And we had the Wild Boar Ravioli which was fantastic. It's in a tomato vodka cream sauce which paired perfectly with the boar. Over all an excellent experience. On the way out we had a helpful conversation with the manager. \n\nGARBANZO BEANS, SUN-DRIED TOMATOES, JALAPENOS,",

Our waitress was inattentive and just bad.\nLovely seating outside, but can be quite dark. We got seated and it took a while to get our menus. Slowly, we got a free appetizer bite (delicious fig on Rosemary shortbread), though no silverware or napkins. Eventually, after a long time we were able to order. \nWe all did the tasting menu.\nThe sweet bread special was cooked very well and was tasty. Octopus was a salad, which I hadn't realized beforehand. It was just okay. Shrimp appetizer was okay (one shrimp).\nThe gnocchi was excellent- wow probably the best dish. Fluffy gnocchi with mint on top, which was a great layer. Squid ink with calamari was just okay. The lamb ragu special was good, but forgettable.\nThe ribeye was very heavy, but very delicious. Loved the egg on top. Cooked well. Buttery.\nThe salmon special was cooked well and was very delicate and flakey.\nThe magi stew was just okay.\nChocolate tort was thick and delicious. Panna cotta was well executed. Very smooth. The tiramisu was not my fav- they had a fruity take on it.\nOverall, the food was great and we got tons of food. We were stuffed. Service was seriously off. Insanely slow start. We were there 2.5 with the first 45 minutes just ordering and getting our table set. They also accidentally threw out two of our leftovers!",

  "text": "Wow... just wow. I'm speechless right now so let me gather my thoughts. I'm moving to Philly so I'm out here visiting the city finding a place to live. Met up with some college friends and this was their recommendation. It can be a bit difficult to find since the main entrance is down a side alley. Walking in, I've never been to Morocco, but I feel like they probably did a good job with the resemblance with the decor. You're seated on couches around a metal table. They begin with everyone's hands out over a basin and rinse them with rose water. Towels in everyone's lap, which was nice since it can get a little messy. The courses are all set and the serving size was based on the number of people. First course was probably my favorite. It came with a large platter of cucumber/tomato salad, roasted vs braised eggplant, and cooled/marinated carrots. It comes with unlimited pita. I love loved loved the cucumber/tomato. Great texture. The flavor of the eggplant was amazing, as well. The next was this crispy pastry shell stuffed with almonds, eggs, and some other spices covered with powdered sugar I think. Great mix of sweet and savory. There was a lemon chicken dish next. I'm not sure if it was baked or made in a tajine. Regardless, it was ridiculously tender. There was a lamb or beef course next...we chose lamb and it was ridiculously tender, as well. The couscous course was amazing, as well. It was like eating pillows with a roasted carrot, potato, and grapes topping. A bowl of fruit came next...more just to cool everything down. The baklava was amazing at the end...seemed like it was made with rosewater and honey. \n\nIt is cash only. Apparently, we asked them, and they had a large party a few years back that gave them fake credit cards and they lost out on several hundred dollars. Don't worry though. If you forget, there's an ATM down the down the street. I'm moving down in July, and this is definitely somewhere I'd take friends and family.",

It is common to have 2 brides at a time which, would have been totally fine with me but if you'd like it solo maybe ask if that can be accommodated.  She was very respectful of my price point and pulled dresses that really flattered my shape.  I didn't feel rushed at all.

I'm so glad I did because it really added to the day of pictures!\n\nSusan did my alterations and she was a rockstar.

Also, side note, she let me in on some amazing advice that saved the day... BRING A MAGIC ERASER!!

He's like a grown up kid.. he's a doctor but wears vans.. my kind of dude. Dr Bryan is so nice and patient I would tell everyone and their mother to go visit him. You can tell he loves what he does (as he is the co-owner of the store if I'm not mistaken) and it's expressed in every aspect of the shop. Everyone who works here is super nice and patient. I went in on a saturday afternoon when I could bring a friend to help me pick out a new pair of glasses. The woman working with us, Beth, couldn't have been nicer. She made me feel like she was another one of my friends just having fun trying on glasses. I never felt like I was keeping her from something more important or that I was being silly for wanting to try on.. \"just one more...\". I picked out a pair of glasses and couldn't be happier with them. Also a big shout-out to John who helped me on the actual day that I bought the glasses who encouraged me to try on \"just one more..\" to make sure I was 100% sure I wanted the ones I was going to buy. I think that modern eye might be a little pricier than your four-eyes or america's best but you're getting designer glasses - it's worth it! I don't think you over pay for what you're getting, they have quality stuff here. Also they couldn't have been better about getting me every discount with my vision insurance - which I appreciate to the max! If you need glasses or contacts get your butt down here quick!

Ah college!\n\nAfter moving away for 11 years and getting a little above the age of the usual suspects down on 2nd Ave I could barely believe it when I heard that they were still open.  A friend decided to get togther at BB this weekend and I was pleased to \"party like its '95\" again!  \n\nThisplace has changed considerably from the old days but not in a bad way.  Downstairs is now a Dick's Last Resort so gone is the huge room full of pool tables and cute boys.  Upstairs where the Havana Lounge was is now the entirety of Buffalo Billiards.  Don't worry though, it is still a pretty sizeable bar!  The huge round bar still exists and these great big Samsung HDTVs are all around the bar.  (Bonus - they had the one in front of me on the NASCAR race!!)  Tables are also available on the left side of the bar.  In the back is another bar and two rooms with pool tables.  Note that you can reserve one or both of these two rooms for private parties (as I have for my December birthday)!  \n\nThey had good 90s rock playing (Soundgarden! Pearl Jam!  Alice in Chains!) which will take you back ,again, in a good way.  The vibe is chill and you can actually hear each other talk.  Drinks were strong - they were not playing around with these.  And all the bartender/bartendress staff I saw were good lookin, so you can have some eye candy with your drink.  Also noticed a dart board in the back too so you can challenge your friends to a duo of bar games (maybe a trio if you play quarters or something?  No?  But it's 1995 man!)\n\nSo yeah, I loved the vibe and the whole feel of this place and am glad I have it reserved for my birthday in a few months.  Give it a try if you are downtown and want to get away from crazy tourist traps and Irish-pub-dance-club places!",

  "text": "There's no question that this place is a little sketchy sketch on the outside...and while the interior is no gem either and little to no English is spoken here, and the kitchen is separated with a curtain, and both times I've been our server has been a minor and placing an order here is like picking a number out of a hat, and the most descriptive words on the menu are \"three shredded stuff,\"  I'm intrigued. This is not your typical Americanized joint. Is it fast? Yes, but that's as American as it gets. Portions are definitely generous and you won't find sweet and sour chicken on this menu...unless I read it wrong. Yelpers in the know of the legit Chinese food directed me CPH. I wouldn't have made it through my first experience without their guidance! 30 shrimp/pork dumplings, 1 pork bun, and 1 order or fried rice later, I got a good taste of MSG free Chinese Cuisine. While China Pasta House literally is a noodle house with most dishes resembling Pho or Udon dishes you can also enjoy Century Eggs, Gruel, rice dishes, Hot Pot and more. The noodle dishes are really soups and portions are huge and spicy here mean spicy, like a level ten spicy. While fellow yelpers broke a sweat over their noodle dishes I peacefully enjoyed my fried rice and Pork Bun. I'd never seen anything like it! So if you love spicy food then this place is for you. You're bound to run into Chinese students and families at this spot. For sure check out the the specials as they feature several soups that are on the regular menu and it's a good way to taste something new and not commit to full-sized entree.  \n-If you're not super familiar with Chinese food, it's ok! I'm not either....read the Yelp reviews first!",

I love their Lo Mein. For apps I always get the vegetable Gyoza , vegetable spring rolls and for my meal i get the vegetable Lo mein.   Their sushi is awesome too. My girlfriend got the California roll, spicy tuna, and she got pork dumplings which is the only spot she eats them from. I prefer sitting down and eating here it's a nice feel and their waitresses are great. Def a great place for a cheap satisfying date or to take a big family.",

  "text": "A 2013 update is in order.  \n\nBasically, everything I've said in my last review of this place has held true.  I come here 2 or 3 times a year just to see how they are doing.  I love Indian food, but I tend to go to their competition up the street far more often for various reasons.  \n\nI do think they've improved since my last review.  They've renovated the place.  It's much nicer now.  They still have the best naan I've had in the area which comes straight out of the oven perfectly buttered in a basket to your table.  I still think their dishes can be hit or miss, but lately they've hit more often than they've missed for me.  Still some great Tandoori Chicken they're serving here.  \n\nI will knock them on one thing.  I'm noticing that some places try to do this.  They charge you the weekend buffet price, which is two dollars more, on Friday.  Now, I know of one Indian place not too far that puts out a bigger spread for that extra money.  This place does not seem to do that.  Or if they do, I sure don't notice it.  Because I went two days ago on Friday, and it was similar to what I always see here.  \n\nEvery time I want to like them more, they do something that irks me.  And again, this is why I only come here a couple of times a year as opposed to weekly to their competition up the street.",

  "text": "I go to Fleming's about once a year.  I know that while it will be expensive, all the food will be good, the service will be friendly, and the atmosphere will be clean and comfortable.\n\nMy friend and I sat in the bar - first at the bar for cocktails, and then moving into a bar booth for dinner.  Our server was efficient, although a little slammed with all the tables she had going.  Great deals for happy hour from 5-7 - they offer 5-$6 drinks, and 5-$5 appetizers.  \n\nTaking advantage of the discounts, we shared the pork belly and tenderloin carpaccio to start with.  The pork belly was just okay - the best part of that plate was actually the creamy goat cheese grits that accompanied it - yum!  The sweet onion chutney was just not enough of a contrast with the rest of the plate.\n\nThe carpaccio was excellent.   It was a generous portion, sliced extremely thin, with capers and a creole mustard sauce on top,  with cheesy crackers to put it on.  My one wish would have been more 'bite' to the sauce.\n\nFor dinner I had the French Onion soup and the small plate of New Bedford Scallops.  This was one of the best French Onion soups I have ever had.  It was baked with both gruyère and parmesan cheeses, with a nice crispness to the bread inside.  The cheese topping was incredible, and the broth was flavorful without being too salty.\n\nI liked the scallops, but didn't love them.  The sauce had flavor, but the scallops didn't really seem to.  I  know, I know, only eat steak in a steakhouse, but I'm a seafood girl!\n\nFor dessert  we split the carrot cake.  Since I am a carrot cake connoisseur, I will rate this one 6/10.  Very moist which I love, it did not have even close to enough frosting on it/in it.  I guess that's why they serve it with a side of homemade whip cream - there needs to be some sweetness to contrast the non-sweet flavor of the cake part.  More than just a tiny drizzle of dark rum caramel on the side was needed, too.\n\nFinal thought - GET WIFI!  Sheesh - close to the airport, close to many businesses - enter this century and make the upgrade - thanks!",

  "text": "Recently took the hubs to his first ever pro football game, Tampa Bucs versus the Philadelphia Eagles.  It was quite the game (Eagles won in the LAST TWO SECONDS of the game) and very exciting for someones first game.\n\nThe reason I gave the stadium three stars?  \n\nIt needs a facelift desperately.  It's an utter bummer that most of the games are blacked out in the Tampa Bay area due to the almighty dollar.  Even with the games being blacked out, the seats are not full to capacity for the Bucs games which I think was their plan.  Hmmm...if we black out the games, it would force fans to COME to the games.\n\nBut this is definitely a case of, \"if you build it, they will come.\"\n\nThe experience of watching a game live is a tough one if you are only used to seeing them on television.  There are no commentators to guide you through the action on the field.  But, in other arenas I have been to (shout out to Giant's stadium in New Jersey -- Go Big Blue!) there is an ENORMOUS teleprompter that you can rely on for replays of the games action.  \n\nNot the case in Raymond James.  The teleprompters/jumbotrons are decades old and in desperate need of renovation.  While the overhaul of the new stadium lends itself well to new food courts, the game atmosphere itself was not well thought out.\n\nThere is nowhere near enough parking.  We found ourselves having to head over to Hillsborough Community College to park in their lots and walking nearly six blocks to get back over to the stadium (buy a parking pass if you frequent the stadium often).  On the ground themselves, there is a lot of well tended grassy areas, so if you get there early enough to tailgate, there is plenty of room to spread out and have a picnic or even barbecue on the grounds (they allow that so long as you adhere by some of their policies -- see the website for guidelines of what you can and cannot bring onto the stadium grounds).\n\nThe new stadium though is lovely compared to the old one.  My daughter used to work in the food court of the old one and it was definitely dilapidated and run down compared to this one.  Expect to pay upwards of $7.00 for a beer and $4.00 for a small bottle of water.  \n\nOverall, its a great place to go and cheer on your team, watch a concert or attend a soccer game.  Really not a bad seat in the house as the field is very visible from any angle in the stadium.",

  "text": "The 1 page menu is made up of several courses with the third course being the main course. You can select the $85 tasting menu, or order a la carte. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the experience, but I think that I prefer high end meals at other Philadelphia restaurants such as Tinto, and Bibou more. For the price I think I should have been blown away by more than one dish. However I decided to rate Laurel at 5 stars because my preference is based largely on my love of rich flavors rather than the skill of the chef.\n\nThe chef is a master of texture. It was interesting to have cauliflower that was puréed and more granular on the same plate. The gnocchi was the best of my life, and the hands down best dish that we had. Even without the pancetta it would have been amazing because the gnocchi could not have been lighter. I had the skate wing, but liked my sisters duck much better. The texture of the skate wing was perfect, but I didn't enjoy the way the flavors blended together because I felt that it was boring. If you appreciate light flavors that are seamlessly blended to create something new, you will enjoy the skate wing.\n\nService was top notch. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and personable. There was never a moment where we wanted for anything.\n\nThe atmosphere was intimate, and felt like we were dining in someone's elegant, and tasteful home.",

Seasoned by angels and cooked with such perfection that I will absolutely crave this for the rest of my life! THIS, my dear Yelp people, is EXACTLY what I mean by \"flavorful\" seasoning.

Even the Strawberry Banana Smoothie ($6) is excellent!\n\nTito's is currently located in an empty lot next to the Citgo Gas Station on the corner of North Jones Ave and West Waters Street, but this is also the location of their soon to be brick & mortar restaurant.

We both had French toast which was very good, the energy bowl, and tomato soup. I'm excited to come back another time and try their veggie burger. I appreciate when a restaurant has vegan/vegetarian options. \n\nThe only thing I'd really like to see is a non-dairy creamer or milk for coffee. Soy, almond, coconut, something to splash in my coffee would be lovely even though I've learned through experiences like this to enjoy black coffee...\n\nGood experience. My friend and I agreed we'd come here again.",

The delivery man was nice and the pizza came on time. \n\nI ordered a plain pizza which came hot and thin crusted and a cheeseburger hoagie because I haven't ever seen that on a menu up here in Philadelphia. The pizza was yummy and so was the cheeseburger hoagie. The pizza dough seemed lighter with a thinner crust than from Joe's (we both love thin crust pizza). Frankly we all enjoyed both items and I recommend you try this place because everything came hot, fresh and on time!",

  "text": "The crepe gods have answered my calls!!! \n\nThe owners have years of experience and they're passionate and very particular about their ingredients.  You can just taste it.\n\nI absolutely love their transparency... The fact that you can watch Yanna, the owner, work her magic at the crepe station behind glass is a great statement that they have nothing to hide. \n\nYesterday, I sought out a hearty meal to refuel from holiday shopping and a hearty meal was exactly what I got at @kaffe_crepe , a restaurant on my list of favorite places to eat in Reno.  \n\nI was drawn to their seasonal Reno Wonderland Breakfast Crepe- Cheddar cheese, smoked ham, bacon, scrambled eggs, roasted red potatoes, green onions, and sour cream.\n\nMy crepe was so satisfying and comforting.  \n\nWhat made my crepe amazing:\n*potatoes perfectly roasted\n*eggs cooked fresh with perfect doneness and full of flavor\n*Perfect amount of cheese\n*Plenty of meat\n*Green onions complimented and made other flavors pop\n*Sour cream brought richness and tied everything together\n*Cholula hot sauce (optional) for kick and spice\n*Quality ingredients you can taste\n*Perfect Crepe\n\nKaffe Crepe offers both savory and sweet crepes with seasonal specials so you'll never run out of options.  There's also room for endless customizations. \n\nTheir sweet crepes are amazing as well, with many combinations offered.  A base of Nutella,  Biscoff, cream, and custard along with fresh fruits will cater to anyone's taste and make anyone happy.  \n\nIt gets really interesting when their sweet specials come along, including mouthwatering ingredients and flavor combinations like lemon curd and chocolate truffles with raspberries and condensed milk.  I remember a year when they offered apple pie crepes with cinnamon and whipped cream. \n\nThey offer ice cream so if that's your jam, they've got you covered. \n\nKaffe Crepe has thought of every aspect of the meal and offers a wide variety of drinks-  artisan coffees, teas, seasonal drinks, specialty drinks, and other bottled drinks.\n\nCurrently, their list of holiday drinks is the longest I've seen of any local business that I've visited this year. Nutty White Mocha, Cranberry Lemonade, or Almond Roca anyone?\n\nThe chef is passionate about her creations and sources the freshest local ingredients she can find.  \n\nShe's made a special restaurant with the perfect atmosphere, food, and drinks and I'm forever thankful that she chose our city to share her special talent with. \n\nP.S. gift cards available for the perfect gift",

I've never expected to find something here that I haven't. Equally, they occasionally surprise me by what they do carry.\n\nI love that Philadelphia has a bookstore across from its best park, and what that says. I never liked B&N growing up until I started frequenting this location.\n\nThe only thing I wish they'd do to improve is extend the magazine sections a bit... Tower always had the best, and somebody needs to compete.\n\nYes, Philadelphia has MANY great indie bookstores, and I can't underplay that, but this place deserves credit/recognition for its easy-to-find familiarity, great service, and extensive inventory.",

This place was pretty busy when we first walked in most of the tables were already full but luckily I booked ahead and made a reservation for the six of us and I was glad that I did, we were seated right away and our waitress came over and took our drink order unfortunately she got a few of the drinks mixed up but that's okay we quickly got them all fixed the waitress was very friendly and very attentive in fact all of the staff were nice. for my personal thoughts on the buffet I felt they were a little lacking I was expecting a little bit more barbecue the only thing they had on the buffet was some pulled pork which is my favorite but I would have like to try it or at least sample of some of the other meat items. They did have a homemade Belgian waffle station where I was told that a famous baseball players brother is the one that actually made the waffles for us he was very funny . They had lots of toppings to choose from as far as syrups chocolate chips except they're missing peanut butter I love peanut butter on waffles but that's my personal preference. overall it wasn't that bad of a place to try I will certainly be back to try some of their regular meals and maybe not on a Sunday during a particularly busy lunch rush, overall I give it 2 thumbs up!",

I felt very carefree and happy just as a result of being up there. Our server, Charles, was very charismatic and fun. I like that he introduced himself and shook hands with everyone at all of his tables, and remembered mine and Devin's names throughout the meal. \"Christine, my love, how are you doing?\" Charming as hell. Loved it. The entire team of servers worked together seamlessly to clear plates in a timely manner and keep our water glasses full. Charles also put together a really adorable birthday card for me and had a bunch of staff members sign it. Awesome!\n\nThe food was pretty good. Not stellar, but definitely good. I liked the escargot but felt the puff pastry was kind of stale. The soup was not my style, but it was really my fault for ordering something when I didn't know what it was. Tip for the French cuisine-ignorant: vichyssoise is served cold. It would have been MUCH better hot. Like clam chowder, except smoked salmon. But I didn't really like it cold. The pork chop was good but didn't blow me out of the water. Devin got the monkfish special which was MUCH better. The star of my meal was the creme brulee! It was truly perfect.\n\nI did the prix fixe menu which was reasonable at $38.99 for 4 courses, and they were full size - not tiny tasting plates - so it was a really great deal. \n\nI would be willing to try other things off the menu again, but I definitely want to come back to enjoy some of their delicious drinks (the cocktails were superb - I recommend the Summer Fashion - like an Old Fashioned with a peachy twist) and desserts on that lovely patio.",

  "text": "As much as I love the food at Pats, I can no longer continue to come here during normal business hours. Let me preface by saying, the food is exceptional. From pizza to cheesesteaks, anything you get is mind blowingly stellar. However, my issue is with how busy they are and how it affects service.\nMy job is a mile down the road and I usually order delivery. It takes no less than 45 minutes to arrive. So long! The other day, I decided to sit-in for lunch thinking it would be quicker. I was sadly mistaken! I came at 12 o'clock (typical lunch break time) and waited 35 minutes to get my food! What did I order you might wonder? A cheesesteak! That's it! I don't understand what took so long because when I came in, they're only three patrons seated in the whole restaurant. The phones were not ringing off the hook, either. When my food finally came I had to take it to go-to because so much time had passed. While I waited, the servers gave a half-hearted apology.. as though it was the norm. When I went to leave, there was a line almost to the door of people waiting to order.\nFor my cheesesteak and fountain soda I paid just under $16. Not worth it, too expensive and too long of a wait, I'll go elsewhere. \nAlso, one time when I got delivery to my job, the delivery driver asked me, \"why do you eat this junk?\" Not cool. If you don't love your job, quit.",

  "text": "I am not a fan of Buffets for several reasons.  Number one is feeling like you are in a contest to fill your plate with massive amounts of assorted foods out of huge vats.  One chomps down all on your plate with thoughts of picking the next quantitive amounts to fill a plate again.  I peer around to other tables amassed with hungry people doing the same thing we are.  Eating fast and then hurrying down to get to the vats of food that awaits them.  You eat faster than usual for some reason.  Number two is that eating this way is like a chore that must be done in an orderly fashion and not relaxing as a leisurely meal should be. This is just my opinion and means nothing to the variety, cleanliness of the place. Now, to the food itself.  There are several choices of soups and I mean several. I scooped out some won-ton soup.  I might add, very good.  There were staples, like lo-mein, orange chicken, pineapple sticky rice out of a real pineapple. Nice touch, beef with broccoli, fried rice.  They had a salad bar, filled with lobster salads, edomame, mussels in shells, crab salads and on and on.  I had some mussels and they were wonderful.  Then there is the Sushi bar which was loaded with very typical sushi.  I had a few pieces and they were OK.  Then comes the Hibachi bar, which as you know you pick the veggies and the meats and the chef cooks it up for you with a sauce of your choice.  I didn't try it because I was tired from running to get tastes of the food in the vats and eating so fast.  Also, I don't have the patience to pick veggies, meats and sauces and wait for the chef to mix this feast all together so I opted out of it.  Now, for the extensive dessert bar.  Hop on your roller skates to grab some culinary delights.  I had the coffee, carmelly little moist pastry which was so good.  There were so many to choose from all looking good and beautifully displayed.  And the best part, was the giant tubs of ice cream with about 6 choices.  I chose the very olive green ice cream which reminded me of Hawaii's azuki bean ice cream.  I loved it there and it was good here.   Of course, there was a section with all fruits, jellos,  I went to this place mostly because I found a 30% off coupon in the Az. Star newspaper.  I'm a coupon, groupon, living social consumer, so when I see a deal, I act on it.  $15.00 bucks for the two of us.  Now, that's a ganga in anyones book.  Another plus is the place is huge ( Once housed Factory-to-U ) on Speedway and Swan.  It is beautifully decorated and clean.  So far anyhow, it has recently just opened.  So you can ignore my being not a fan of buffets and give them a try.",

I honestly don't know how authentic this bakery is, but there is a mix of Korean bakery items, more \"Americanized items, and other random Asian desserts. But nonetheless, it's cute and delicious. \n\nFirst and foremost, I LOVE the creme puffs from here. They are not as sweet as what you thing a creme puff is in bite sizes. You can get a package of 10 and bring it to the Korean restaurants! They have mocha cakes, lots of sponge cakes in a variety of flavors, and general cakes. And if you want to get someone a gift who loves playing pokemon go, this is where you get your pokemon theme cookies. They also have Hello-Kitty cakes. \n\nGreat place to just stop in and they open late for a bakery until 8pm. There are also a few tables for you to sit and enjoy your desserts too!",

  "text": "Ugh, I used to love White Castle. Their restaurant serves cheap food. But beware: their belly bombers meet up to their name. One night when I ate White Castle, I had the worst stomach ache known to man and I ended up staying in bed for three days. True story.\nEnough about that event, I won't be reviewing the food this time, just the service. Not too long ago, I took my mom through the drive through at this location. Usually, the service is a quick in and out. But this time we had the worst experience, ever. \nFor one, we had to wait over 30 minutes in queue in the drive through. (Why are my worst experiences with fast food are almost all in a drive through?) My mother ordered ten jalapeno sliders, an order of onion rings, and a large chocolate shake. Don't ask me how she eats all that, but that is what she ordered.\nAgain, we waited for a long period of time. Once we got to the drive through window, a teenager read my order completely wrong and we had to remind him what we did order. \nMy mom was very upset and asked for this order to be free. The manager, who was extremely abrupt and rude beyond belief marched up to the register and pushed our food out the window. What was the worst part of the problem, my mother didn't get what we ordered. The manager forgot to give us our onion rings, in addition to not charging anything on her debit card.\nImmediately, I dialed the customer service line and filed a complaint with the corporate office. In addition, I will not be visiting White Castle ever again, ever!",

My hubby got distracted by the samples up front. He tried the regular ghost pepper salsa and said it wasn't that bad. The guy behind the counter said, \"Well, I got one for ya!\" He challenged him to the real ghost pepper salsa, the one where you have to sign a waiver beforehand....\n\nSo he signed it. Tried the salsa, then didn't drink anything for a minute (part of the challenge). He got his pic on the Wall of Flame...but he was struggling with the heat, haha. Would love to shop around next time we're in NOLA...I'd buy all the chipotle products!!",

We got some drinks and ordered the filet mignon and chicken milanese which also came with some complimentary bread. Our mushroom soup appetizer had a rich and earthy taste. The steak was cooked to perfection and my friend enjoyed her meal. \n\nI heard rumors that they make the best key lime pie in TOWN. Now, we aren't huge key lime pie lovers, but we had to give it a try. It is definitely worth it if you don't hate key lime. The crust is made from scratch which makes everything come together and you can taste the delicious pecans mixed into it. \n\nA quick shout out to our waiter (Justin) and the manager here who made the end of a stressful day turn out great. Justin was very attentive, knew the menu well, and offered great recommendations. I even learned about their rewards program through their app on his recommendation too. If you make an account via facebook, you get a free 100 points! I am definitely coming back and I really enjoyed dining here. Huge thanks to all the staff for a great experience :)\n\nTips: Happy hour daily 4pm-7pm, Wednesday 4pm-Close (on drinks and small plates).\nThe porcini-crusted rib-eye is powder (not actual porcini mushrooms) just fyi.\nMade from scratch key lime pie with home-made crust.",

There is actually plenty of space in the back (the parking garage is deceptively large) - so it'd be very helpful if cars can keep moving instead of waiting of people to pull out!\n\nI'm going to be honest - I usually don't buy groceries from whole foods because it is just too expensive for my budget, but I love coming to this location to indulge in Dizengoff with a good beer or two. Whole Foods bar prices are very reasonable, and I've gotten a chance to try beer on tap that I've never had elsewhere before! While I don't usually end up buying much in terms of groceries, I love wandering around and admiring how beautiful all the produce looks. Trader Joe's will still be my place for much more affordable groceries, but I love love hanging out at this Whole Foods location.\n\nThe downstairs coffee bar is a must for a coffee lover for me. I tried their nitro cold brew, and it was absolutely perfect. This whole foods location is a major improvement from their previous location just down the street.",

My favorite dishes to order are the char siu bau (BBQ pork bun), har gow (shrimp dumpling), shumai (pork dumpling with mushroom and shrimp inside), bean curd (pork dumplings wrapped with bean curd skin), and the beef wrapped with rice noodles. They add cilantro to the beef wrapped rice noodles which really gives it a pop of freshness. The egg tarts for dessert are also really good. We typically spend about 10 dollars a person. It's better to go with a group of people because you get to try more things :) The only annoying part about this place which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that sometimes the carts stop coming around or it takes a really long time for the cart to come back your way.",

On my visit this week our service was so poor I felt it was time to review.  One server came over, brought menus, took our drink order and let us know he would not be our server but our server Jordan would be with us soon.  Our drinks took a good 15 minute to arrive.  All we ordered was beer and wine.  We then waited another 15 minutes for her to come back and take our food orders.  The food actually came quickly which is not typical for Boca.  Then she asked if she could bring our checks while one of the people at our table was still eating.  This is a major pet peeve of mine.  We did not mention that we were in a hurry and no one was concerned about our time when we were waiting on our drinks or waiting to order.   She quickly brought our checks but never came to pick them up.  We waited at least 10 minutes for her to pick up our checks until we just went inside and brought them to her.  Not once during the entire experience did she apologize for taking so long to provide service.",

  "text": "Wow! I am super impressed with this experience. I've been wanting to try hot pot for a while, but honestly I was a bit intimidated because I didn't know HOW to eat hot pot.\n\nAfter reading some online articles and watching \"how to hot pot\" videos, I invited my family to celebrate my birthday this past weekend at Nine Spices (which has fantastic reviews).\n\nFirst of all, the place was packed at 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon, so you know it's a popular place. I was a tad bit concerned due to COVID, but the booths are set up so that you are only facing your party (and we are all vaccinated).\n\nWe were sat at a six person booth next to the conveyor belt which continually circles with ingredients you can throw into your hot pot.\n\nThere were great options on broth choices. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn't able to explain them too thoroughly, but enough for my dad to figure out which one wasn't chicken, beef or pork based (Chinese herbal, in case you want to know).\n\nWe got the traditional, kimchee, spicy and Chinese herbal between the five of us. Then it came to ordering all of the goodies to put in your pot.\n\nWe mainly focused on seafood, dumplings and veggies. (Note: the baby octopus are truly small intact baby octopus. My mother-in-law was a little shaken by this.) Everything was super fresh!\n\nThe only meats we ordered were beef and pork dumplings. They gave us an exorbitant amount of beef. I think that must be a popular choice. Half of our table doesn't eat beef, though, so my husband really had to chow down.\n\nThe pork dumplings were amazing. I love the variety of mushrooms and greens to add. It was also fun to grab something off the conveyor and drop it into your little boiling pot.\n\nDon't forget the sauces and sides bar which was stocked with approximately 20+ sauce choices and about 10 different sides (the squid salad is the bomb!). It also had add-ins for your soup like hot peppers, cilantro and green onions.\n\nBy the time we were done hot potting, we were all amazed at how fantastic the remaining broth was. Threw in some noodles and finished it off as a soup.\n\nThey have hand-dipped ice cream included for dessert as well. (Although we were too stuffed to indulge)\n\nEverything was clean and the food was top quality. As another reviewer mentioned, some of the food may be out of your \"comfort zone\". However, that is not a reason to discount this fantastic spot. You choose what you want at your table. So, if baby octopus and pig's blood aren't your thing, you don't have to have them!\n\nWe didn't try the BBQ, but it seemed to be quite popular for most of the tables.\n\nIf you haven't tried hot pot before, I recommend looking up some tips before you go to make the experience more comfortable, because you don't get much guidance for first timers while you are there.\n\nSet aside two hours to truly dine and enjoy with family and friends!",

This cold cake was nothing like what I had just experienced.  So I went home with the cake in bag sitting on the driver seat waiting to throw it out and I was upset. So I get home and right before I throw it out, I take a bite of the cake and it had warmed up and was just as good. So if you don't like cold cakes just let it sit and all those flavors will marinate into awesomeness. Oh and the uptown location has the best cakes.",

We love Athens on Fourth, but that entails a full meal, wine, etc. First of all, Greek House is stringently clean. They play charming Greek music and it's decorated in Greek fashion. The employees are very courteous and know their menu. We ordered Gyros (no fries) and a Greek salad to go. I was thrilled to see the Gyro meat roasting before our eyes and being freshly carved. I despise ordering a Gyro and being served pre-formed patties. The meat was perfectly carved and seasoned to perfection. The pita was wonderful, and the tomatoes were fresh and sweet. It was one of the best Gyros I've ever had. The Greek salad was huge! Enough for two people, easily. They serve a creamy feta dressing with it that is simply fantastic. We are used to a vinaigrette with a Greek salad, but this dressing puts them all in the shade. The olives were pitted, the tomatoes, onions and cucumbers fresh and the lettuce crispy. We are thrilled to find such a wonderful Greek restaurant so close to home. I must thank my fellow Yelpers, your reviews led us to try this gem!",

Whatever is in season is always on the big projector screens that gives good views regardless of where you sit. \n\nThey've recently come under new management (owned by Rusty Nail peeps) so a few changes have been made. They've replaced the long string of tables close to the bar with high boys but the booths and the string of tables close to the big tvs are still there (great for large groups). They've added a number of dishes to their food menu. I can't remember if the oyster specials have always been there but oysters are half off from 10pm-close. I think there is a trivia and wings special on Wednesday. As always, their beer selection is phenomenal. \n\nWe ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and the pizza fries. The sandwich was good, not the best I've had, but it had to have been the most obtuse shaped chicken cutlet. Definitely would not recommend anyone to eat that if they're on a first date.The pizza fries were a heart attack on a plate; I love pepperoni but the pepperoni sticks are a strange consistency and make me think that's what beef jerky for dogs must taste like. When I placed the order, I was told it would be 30 minutes and it was a full 30 minutes--it takes restaurants less time to serve food and it wasn't even a crazy packed night! Just be aware of the wait time in case you suffer from chronic hangriness. \n\nDon't forget your ID unless you're 100!",

However, there are only 3 skewers to an order, so to really fill up he ended up ordering two.\n\nThe parking is kind of hit or miss.  Sometimes it is valet and there are not too many spots.  Luckily, at 6 p.m. on a Tuesday it is not valet and there was enough parking.  I honestly hate parking on SoHo, because I never know where people actually tow.  You can park all the way down in Hyde Park at the free parking garage and the walk is not terrible, if you want to put your mind at ease.",

  "text": "while i will say that overall the food was pretty decent, le cheri was a bit of a letdown after our whirlwind tour of philly's finest french bistros and restaurants these past couple of months.\n\npluses: the space is a nice mix of old world european flair (with its outdoor garden seating) and upscale fine dining. presentation is fabulous and portions are large. the bread basket and butter are melt-in-your-mouth amazing.\n\nthat being said..\n\nmixed feelings: we shared all of our dishes, including duck terrine and the specials of the day-- stuffed quail and arctic char. the terrine was incredibly delicious at first, but with any sort of pate, there's a limit to how much you can eat before the taste becomes too saturating for your palate. this is where large portions works against them.\n\nthe same can be said of our entrees. the quail and fish were both equally good at the beginning, but were so over-flavored/seasoned that about 75% of the way through our respective half-portions, our taste buds gave out. imagine if you had to finish a single serving by yourself. for that reason, i didn't love the food.\n\nalso, the service (while nice) was a bit of a mismatch in my opinion. at an \"upscale\" french restaurant in rittenhouse, i expect white tablecloth standard of the upmost courteous and professional service. i do not expect someone to joke around with me or make almost quippy remarks about my dining experience. i felt like i was at a chain restaurant. maybe some people like that sort of casual service experience at a fine dining establishment. but personally, it's not my style. call me bougie?",

OK.......we should of known better.\n\nI had a small fried shrimp Po Boy for $14.50.  The roll that the sandwich was served on  was like Jimmy Johns white bread.  There were some (not a lot!) of fried unseasoned shrimp on there with just a bit of slaw.  HUH !!!!!\n\nI love to visit the local dive restaurants.  We ordered at the counter and someone brought our food to the table.  They luckily had several hot sauces on the table for us to use.  Otherwise the sandwich honestly wouldn't of had any taste.\n\nI did love the area where this restaurant if located.  FAR from the hectic Bourbon St crowd.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing ???   Maybe you should try something else ?  Just don't get a \nPo Boy.",

  "text": "I have withheld a review on Cafe Poca Cosa for quite some time.  Quite simply, I don't know what to say.  I am simultaneously impressed and disappointed.  Let me state that my husband loves the place.  This is a restaurant that divides tastes and desires.\n\nFirst, you must remove any preconception of Mexican food when you dine here.  Reviews that compare Cafe Poca Cosa to standard bearer Sonoron restaurants are missing the point.  You will not find burritos and tacos here.  That the menu is in Spanish is irrelevant.\n\nLet's talk about the famous chalk board menu.  My husband likes it.  I find it slightly burdensome.  Some servers take it slowly and really describe the meals while others rush through.  A timid diner loses out. \n\nLet's get to the food.  Most of the dishes are a stew style, which is slowly cooked meats in a complex Mexican-inspired sauce.  They are rich in texture and some of them very much remind me of chicken cacciatore.  Most versions of meat have been flavorful, but some are better than others.  Cafe Poca Cosa is known for their mole sauce, but again it isn't directly comparable to the neighborhood Sonoran place down the street.  The tamale pie is always on the menu.  This is what my husband always orders.  It is sweet and the sauces rotate.  He loves the yellow bell pepper one.  It is not a tamale, however.\n\nThe salad on the plate is ridiculous.  I've only seen one person eat it.  Depending on the contents, my husband and I pick.  It is dominating and in my opinion silly.  There is a salad dressing on the table that is okay, but literally no server has ever explained it to us and it took me two or three visits to even notice it.  \n\nThe meal comes with tortillas and rice and beans.  I like them.  My husband does not.  They also give complementary chips and salsa.  He likes the salsa and the vinegary bite.  I do not.  One thing that REALLY upsets me is that they charge for refills of soft drinks.  When you're charging $15-$25 per plate, I expect you give me a refill of Coke for free.  Period.  So it goes with Cafe Poca Cosa.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an iconic restaurant that should be tried.  It is pricey, so lunch might be a better introduction.  If you go, however, you must do so with an open mind and remember it is not Sonoran Mexican food and isn't intended to be.  I would give it 3.5 stars if Yelp allowed it.",

  "text": "I needed a haircut BADLY, and since I was new to Broad Ripple, I took to Yelp to find a new salon.  A Sign of the Tymes popped up, and I figured I'd give them a try.  I called around noon, and they were able to get me in later that day: that is service!  I scheduled with Randi.  Due to work and traffic, I ended up showing about 20 minutes late (I called ahead and let them know), and Randi was really gracious about it.  NOTE: This place does not accept credit cards, only cash or check.  I wish I would have known about this!  Bring your checkbook!\n\nThe salon is in a really cute building, which looked like it used to be a house.  The salon was really clean and inviting.  They had a good selection of magazine, which I appreciate since so many salons only have hair magazines.  I didn't get a chance to look at them since Randi took me back so quickly.\n\nHer booth was in what looked like it used to be a bedroom, so it was private and really spacious.  I explained to Randi what I wanted (trim off the dead ends, give me some bangs) and she gave me exactly what I wanted.  She even suggested she cut my hair a bit shorter to make it look healthier and fuller.  I was really happy with the cut I got.  She also styled it well which I liked, because I often don't leave the salon liking the style.  I have to re-style it when I get home, but I didn't have to with Randi.\n\nRandi also does color, which made me happy since I was also looking for a new colorist.  She talked with me about different color options, and even offered to order the brand of color I prefer since a Sign of the Tymes didn't carry it.  That seems to me like going above and beyond, since I might have gone to another salon just to get the brand of color I love.\n\nThey had a check-in deal through Yelp where I got $10 off when I checked in.  It was a great deal, since my service ended up being $32 for a shampoo/cut/style.  Pretty reasonable for the service they provided.  I booked my next appointment with Randi because she told me she is moving to working only Tuesdays and I wanted to make sure I got in with her.  \n\nAll in all: cute salon, great service,fair prices.  You can't beat that!  Book with Randi!",

  "text": "The Arlington is more than just a venue where you can catch a flick.  The theater itself has character and charm, and I'd go out of my way to watch a movie here over a more convenient place with less of the above.\n\nI watched Avatar in 3D at the Arlington and it was a very pleasant experience.  Because the theater is old, it only has one screen and a whole lot of seating, including a balcony, and this set-up gives the place a wide-open opulent feel.  The inside walls are built to mimic a quaint village and the ceiling is painted with stars.  The result, instead of being cheesy, is really just pretty.  The screen isn't the largest and the seats aren't the most comfortable around, but nothing is substandard and the loveliness of the place more than makes up for anything lost in the way of modern convenience.\n\nThe lobby and exterior are beautiful as well, with cute hand-painted signs, a courtyard, and a free-standing ticket booth.  If you're strolling through downtown Santa Barbara without the time to stop for a movie, the theater is still worth a peek.  It's a wonderful place, gorgeous and unique, and I'd love to come back and catch another movie under the stars.",

It is tucked into a corner of a strip mall and the sign is very small with lots of other stores also listed, the Pizza Hut is written in black and white, no graphics.

  "text": "I love this place.  Great environment.  Lots of activity.  It's definitely not a quiet place but it is extremely comforting. I mentioned to the bartender that the entire \"vibe\" of the restaurant would be lost if it wasn't for the 50+ real candles in place around the bar and restaurant.  He said that was their SIGNATURE detail. Add in a classic round gas fireplace (with seating area) and you've got a homey, classy inviting environment that just makes you happy.  \n\nThe bartenders and servers are always awesome and because of that, this place has always been busy when I've visited.  \n\nThere are only 2 bartenders on any busy night at the large bar (Our bartender said they tried to have 3 there but they just ran over each other.)  The bartenders also act as a bar backs and as food servers so although our bartender was awesome I can see how there could be frustration at the bar or slow service at times.   I observed a few people getting frustrated when the bartender left to retrieve more salsa and chips. \n \nMost food has been overwhelming excellent and memorable on all visits.  However, on my last visit, the New York strip fajitas left me puzzled.   The steak had absolutely no flavor.....I mean ZERO flavor.   It didn't taste like steak, like pork, like chicken, like nothing... It had no flavor.  I let my friend try it and he said the exact same thing.  I mentioned it to the bartender and he said that the London Broil is marinated but that the NY Strip is not. \n\nI'm going to chalk this up to a one time thing and not judge Matador on just one meal.  The Fajita dish as a whole was excellent. They just need to figure out the missing flavor issue on the New York strip.  \n\nFour stars, still respectable, with an opportunity to improve on their steaks and bar service.  Matador is still one of my favorite places in Boise and I look forward to them returning to 5 stars soon",

  "text": "I get a mean craving for Vietnamese every once in a while, and I immediately thought of Pho Grand when the craving hit last because I always drive by it but never go. One of my favorite things to do on a weekend rainy day is pick up something delicious to go and bring it home while watching all of my shows on DVR... pure heaven. Pho Grand was a great addition to that equation.\n\nI called Pho Grand and placed an order for pick up and the guy on the phone was really nice, and he gave me a wait time of about 15 minutes. I got there about ten minutes later and scored a parking spot right out front, walked in, and my order was already ready! Also, $13 for an appetizer and an entree? I'm definitely okay with that. \n\nWhen I got home I found that they packaged the food in a great way to where everything was still hot and nothing was running all over other things... that's a common problem when I get things to go! For an appetizer I got the veggie spring rolls, and wow. I know for sure that I'm going to be craving those again sometime this week. They were so fresh, so full of veggies and rice, and if you're a cilantro lover like me you'll be very happy with these. The sweet and sour sauce was pretty standard but a nice compliment, and the lady who gave me my food made it a point to tell me to use the s&s on both the rolls and my entree. For the main course I had the Ga Xao Xa Ot (stir-friend chicken with hot chiles and lemongrass) and it was just alright to me. It was kind of sweet which I didn't really like, and I wasn't crazy about the taste of the chicken. Luckily, the two huge spring rolls filled me up plenty.\n\nI like this place quite a bit! Next time I'll try and dine in to see what else they have to offer. If you're craving a good spring roll or want Vietnamese with really fast service, Pho Grand is your place.",

We only waited in line for about 30 minutes (roughly 20 groups ahead of us, so not too bad!)\nInterestingly, I think they priced their menu in a way so that when tax is added, it becomes a complete number. An order of beignets (3 in total) cost $2.73, and the cafe au lait was also $2.73, so in total (plus tax), it came to an even $6!\n\nTBH, I had never tried beignets before, and I had expected a different texture/taste/experience.

  "text": "\"Did you lick it?\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhh no I forgot!\"\n\nA couple of things I did not know about the St Louis Arch was that \n(1) It is huge!\n(2) You can go inside it!\n\nI was in town for a wedding and had decided to come a day early so I could see some of the sights. Boy, was it hot. One of the main things was to see the Gateway Arch. Most major cities have their iconic landmark - Paris has the Eiffel Tower, NY has.. a bunch of things, Seattle has the Space Needle, and St Louis has the Arch. The Arch is situated right next to the Mississippi River within an absolutely gorgeous park with broad walkways, benches, little lakes, and fields. \n\nInside the Arch is the Museum of Westward Expansion, complete with animatronics. Historical figures move about and speak to certain historical events with a personal flair. \n\nA ticket to the top of the Arch can be paired with a Riverboat Cruise, a IMAX movie, or a documentary, but the main event is, of course, the Arch. \n\nKeep in mind, the Arch was built in 1965. What I'm trying to say is that elevator technology wasn't at it's peak.. If you're into science fiction, you'll love the starship escape pod 'feel' of the tram. The lurches and rumbling simply add to the realism. Otherwise, you're in for one claustrophobic experience. \n\nOnce at the top, .. that's about it. Nothing too amazing about it. There are several slots of windows for visitors to peer down onto the city and the river. You can definitely feel the curvature of the peak of the arch and the sometimes swaying with a strong gust. It's also packed with other tourists, so finding someone to take your picture is a breeze. (haha). \n\nThe Arch is one of those things you have to do if you're in St Louis, but not something to revisit again and again.",

  "text": "My wife and I went here because we had driven by it many times and have heard great things about it.  We were very excited because we have not found great bbq in the area since moving here 3 years ago.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and walked in.  They were not that busy, but it took us between 5 and 10 minutes to realize that we should seat ourselves because there are no signs anywhere (not that we could see anyways) and the employees just kept walking by us like we weren't there.  We sat down, looked over the menu, decided what we wanted, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  10 minutes later, a guy comes over and says \"Have you been helped yet?\" We told him no and he took our drink order as well as our food.  Soon after, another lady comes over and says \"Have you been helped yet?\" My wife ordered the 3 Little Pigs (3 pulled pork sliders) and I had the Brisket plate. \n\nThe pork was bland and dry, but the worst part was that when she bit into it, there was a huge hard piece, either gristle or bone, in the first bite.  We decided it must have been an accident and she took a bite from another of the sliders.  AGAIN! As for the brisket, I am not sure if it is because I am from Oklahoma where the BBQ style is different, but I hated it.  It had good flavor, but had tons of liquid and more than half of the substance served was inedible fat (I've heard of marbling, but this was fat marbled with some brisket).  The mashed potatoes I ordered were just that, potatoes.  No gravy, no salt.  Just potatoes with a hint of garlic.  The beans were the only thing that we both enjoyed from our meals.  The BBQ beans were very good, some of the best I have had in a long time. \n\nWe stood up to pay, waited at the cash register for about 5 minutes with not so much as an \"I'll be right with you\" or \"One moment please\". When someone finally came over, he asked how everything was and I said \"To be completely honest with you, it wasn't good.  The pork had gristle and the brisket had so much fat that it was hard to eat.\" His response? \"Yeah we have that problem with our brisket.  that'll be $18.50.\" Honestly? You have that problem with your brisket? Then don't serve it!\n\nWe really wanted to like this place.  We wanted to love it.  Slow seating? Fine. Slow service? Fine. A little gristle in some pulled pork? It happens. The thing is, if the food was good other than these things, we would probably still love it. But, the quality of food was not to par, and we both felt sick a few hours after eating there. So, the search for good BBQ continues.",

I spent an hour just taking it all in without a specific list of books I wanted but found some goodies that I couldn't leave without. If you love books and love to browse for books this is the place to be! \n\nIt's very organized and everything is categorized well (especially for a used bookstore) so my OCD was happy, too. If you can think it, they have it.   \n\nThey also have games, old vinyl records and toys. I didn't have any interest in those as I was here for the books, but it all looked organized as well. \n\nLove, love, love the book exchange program and you can bet if I lived in Nashville this is where I would be 90% of the time!",

  "text": "Gather 'round, friends. I'd like to tell you the secret to finding decent Mexican food in Indianapolis. It all starts with finding a restaurant with a name that has nothing to do with anything remotely Mexican. Find a restaurant with a gringo name, and you might find someone in the kitchen making good Mexican food (i.e. Biscuits Cafe, Chris's Ice Cream). \n\nBut let's focus on Biscuits Cafe. Does that sound like a good Mexican place to you? Of course not -- why would it? Mexicans don't eat biscuits. It's just not a thing. However, they make really good Mexican food at Biscuits Cafe, so you should visit to partake of their Mexican food. \n\n(Although, I've heard they make awesome biscuits and gravy, too, so you should come for that if you feel in the mood. They serve breakfast all day!)\n\nWe got the chicken tacos al pastor and fajita platter, and both were really good. To me, the sign of a good Mexican place is whether they have good rice and beans. Rice and beans are the backbone to any Mexican meal, so if they are good, then that sets the tone for the rest of the meal. Fortunately, they have excellent refried beans (covered with yellow cheese, as they should) and Mexican rice. The rice doesn't have peas and carrots in it, by the way. My chicken tacos were served with diced onions and cilantro, and I was given two huge bottles of house-made red and green salsa to use at my discretion. The green salsa was mild, and the red salsa had a chipotle bite to it and was a little more spicy. Both were really good and went well with the tacos. \n\nThe fajitas platter comes out sizzling, so be careful when touching the plate! My husband said his fajitas were really good. \n\nMy kids got pancakes and bacon. (I know, right? I mean, we're at a Mexican restaurant ... but what are you gonna do. Kids, dude.) They loved their pancakes! The pancakes come three to an order, but they are kid-sized and come with your choice of meat (bacon or sausage) and fruit. They even provide you with warm syrup to drizzle over your pancakes. My kids ate most of their meal, which is unusual because they usually leave at least 2/3 of it on their plate! Wasteful kids! (Heaven love them.)\n\nLike most Mexican restaurants, Biscuits Cafe gives you complimentary chips and salsa when you sit down. Both are excellent and addicting, as chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant should be.",

They have a beautiful deck to enjoy in the summer and fall. During the winter months there's a fireplace inside to make it cozy! The food is good, but expect higher prices than in the valley. There's a cost to do business on the mountain, increased delivery charges and labor. Most employees have to commute, so please keep this in mind while tipping. The weekends are crazy but if you can get away during the week it's a delight. I really enjoy the Friday Fish Fry! Service is sporadic depending upon the staff. We have seen indifference to the amazing Josie. That girl could give lessons. She wasn't our server this visit but it was a joy to watch her non stop smile and her attention to details.",

  "text": "I so badly want to love this place. Convenient downtown location, beautiful open loft space, online scheduling, never loud or crowded, very friendly staff -- all great attributes in a salon. Getting a blowout in such a chic space just makes you feel fabulous. But I just cannot get any of the stylists to LISTEN to me. I know my hair, and I know that if a stylist uses too much product, my hair falls flat and greasy after a few hours. I might have a shot in hell at making a blowout last to the 2nd day if there is VERY little product in it. A simple blowdry is all I need.\n\nI've gotten maybe 6 blowouts here at Wip, and each and every time, I've requested that the stylist use as little product as possible, explaining how my hair reacts. They always say yes and make me think they understand, yet they always add more more more. They promise to use \"just one thing,\" then that one thing becomes root spray, shine serum, volumizer, straightening cream, hairspray, whatever. An hour later, and I have six different things in my hair, and it looks great, but I know I'll get only 6 hours out of it. So, $35 for one afternoon of fabulous hair. I'm not sure how else to communicate what I want, and I keep trying this place over and over with the same result, so I'll probably just stop trying.",

  "text": "Excited to try out the new restaurant in Broad Ripple. We found parking easily and were greeted right away. We were a little disappointed in the limited menu- 4-5 soup/salads, 4-5 flatbreads and 4-5 sandwiches plus some apps and desserts. That being said, I'd rather have a small menu where attention is paid and the items were done well than a many mediocre dishes. We chose the pepperoni flatbread, which had an amazing crust. The lemon ricotta cheese was a little different, but the bread was a hit. We had the fried fish sandwich, the best and the lobster roll- all particularly well-done. We were especially appreciative of the attention given to accommodate food allergies.\n\nOnly two real drawbacks- we aren't beer drinkers and while this is an offshoot of Sun King Brewery, we were disappointed that they only carried one Ash and Elm cider. That being said/ they had many other drink options, both with and without alcohol. The only dish that was a disappointment was the whooping pie. Lovely playing, made in house, but it was bland and dry. It wasn't made today, and it was just out of place with the excellence and care shown in the rest of the meal.",

  "text": "I love Oreganos, but I hate the wait! Maybe now that a second location is opening, yes a second one, finally!!!!, we won't have to wait 30-45 minutes to stuff our faces with their amazing cheese bread or delicious pasta. The Alfredo the Dark is an old favorite, however, the sauce has been reformulated and it is lighter and it makes for a lighter dish, but definitely takes away from the flavor of the dish.   The cheese bread is awesome on every level and huge, just like all of their portion sizes, so if you like to share, this is the place to do it!  My husband is a fan of the baked ziti and the meatballs, he thinks it is seasoned perfectly, the bread bowl is delicious (but dry at times) and the meatballs taste like the have been cooked for days, in a good way.  \n\nTheir chicken (the side) is huge and awesome, the seasoning makes it the perfect addition to any salad, especially the off the menu, old school salad.  Their ranch dressing is almost as good as Eegees and they also have a roasted red pepper Italian that is awesome!\n\n\n\n***** Location two opens in March on Oracle and Orange Grove, where El Charro used to be.",

We arrived at 6:30 (seemed SO early for us on a Saturday) and told 30-45 min wait. No prob, we hit up a nearby happy hour and waited for a text. After 45 mins, we decided to go back and check in. Apparently our table was \"running late,\" but we could be seated at the oyster bar for a drink. Unfortunately a couple had sat down without \"clearing\" it with the host (note: you need to clear with the host before sitting), and the hostess awkwardly had to bump them out and seat us. If I hadn't have had one glass of wine before hand I would have really been cringing at this awkwardness. An hour and a half after we arrived, we were seated at a table next to said oyster bar. However a group of wine-o-phile suburban soccer moms sat at the bar directly in front of us and were LOUDDDD. Like stomping, shouting, obviously having a damn good time. So our dinner was distracting to say the least.\n\nAll of the food was excellent.\nSaffron rice balls - satisfying and warm. \nIsraeli cous cous- light! \nMoroccan ribs- they fell right off the bone. They were my favorite.\nLasagna- Loved the juxtaposition of the crispy burnt edges and soft cheesy filling.  \n\nMy 1/2 glasses of wine were definitely overpoured and I did not mind one bit. \nI would give 5 stars if they had taken reservations, estimated our wait time more appropriately, and not sat us next to the ladies who clearly don't get out much. \nFood, wine, and decor are worthy of 5 stars!

Even if you don't traditionally go nuts over baklava, you owe it to your tongue to try this one.\n\nHalf price appetizers when we were there (late afternoon), so we loaded up with hummus, tzatziki, tyropita and spanakopita ... each was right at the \"very good, order again\" level. Tyropita was possibly the favorite of the bunch.\n\nSpecialty gyro was dang tasty but know that it's knife and fork, you're definitely not picking this monster up to eat it. Flavors were deliciously familiar yet also a bit different & distinctive. I'd be totally happy to get it again although I might save the extra dollar and just get the classic version next time.\n\nOwners, if you're listening - please add a hummus and tzatziki combo appetizer plate to your menu. I'd happily pay in genuine United Statesian currency for it. I love tzatziki but having to get a giant portion of it all by itself (or as part of a $15 plate) was a bit of a bummer.",

I HAVE THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE  LESS THAN A WEEK AND YOU ARE DOING ME A FAVOR BY WARRANTING IT?\n\nThen, she says : I CAN SEE YOU ARE ANGRY?\n\nME: Angry? Moi? \n\nOF COUSE NOT!\n\nI just love spending $119 on a defective piece of crap that hasn't worked even a week. I love a company like Primal that doesn't give a rats behind ONCE the customer has bought a product but seemed so damn interested BEFORE the purchase was made.I LOVE a company that doen't stand up for it's customers AND I love a full dish of bad attitude and smugness served on top of it.\n\nShe handed me a new battery and cord LIKE THATS A BIG DEAL but then tells me next problem is on me to address with the company! And she adds, what do you expect, its from China!!!!\n\nTOUNGE HELD!\n\nSee ya Primal!\n\nYou might have a great store but as long as THIS is the way you treat customers, I will find someplace else that appreciates my business!",

The $10 happy hour is a great deal, but by the time I manage to get my bracelet and stand in line at the bar for a drink I am lucky to get 2 drinks. Not to mention the happy hour rum & cokes taste like rubbing alcohol!  My suggestion is to skip the bracelet line and just order a beer. \n\nMacDintons is a great scene for the poor college student, but I have outgrown this crowd. There are so many better bars in South Tampa for young professionals.",

  "text": "I LOVE Time Market. For So. Many. Reasons. This place is truly excellent and quickly becoming one of my favorite places to spend time. Yesterday I enjoyed a glass of white wine (\"planeta,\" a chardonnay blend featuring tasting notes of papaya and peaches; delicious) with their daily special of steak focaccia while sitting in the patio, enjoying the Tucson sunset. The afternoon/early evening vibe was the perfect way to end a slow Monday. The steak (I don't recall the cut, but I would guess skirt steak) was cooked to perfection, with each bite not overly chewy or fibrinous. Steak with chimichurri sauce can sometimes be a played out combination, but when executed this well, it's hard to complain. The focaccia was freshly baked, soft, warm... the perfect vessel for umptious protein.  \n\nIn general however, Time Market is great for so many other things. Obviously, they feature a variety of fresh organically grown produce, in addition to other artisan products (think cheeses, meats, etc.). Their pantry selection features nice arrangement of all sorts of goods, from different hot sauces, to spices used in any global cuisine you could think of. They also have an excellent wine selection, and is one of my go-to locales to purchase natural wine in Tucson (DM if you want to have a conversation about natural wine). \n\nTime Market is a gem in Tucson, serving as a great place to share a coffee and catch up with friends, do your weekly grocery shopping, or enjoying a nice meal on the patio. It has it all.",

  "text": "I recently left a Yelp review that voiced my disappointment in Chinese food here in the Old Pueblo (I believe I compared all Tucson Chinese food to Panda Express) and several Yelpers came to my aid and suggested some places I might try. A few nights ago, I tried one of them (thanks for the tip, Toni M.!) and I'm happy to report that I now stand corrected. Tucson does have delicious, authentic Chinese food, and it can be found at China Szechwan. \n\nThere are two menus - one, which looks like the typical fare you'd find at many other Chinese restaurants, and a smaller menu full of magical items - like water boiled fish.Don't let the name of this dish fool you - the \"water\" that the fish is cooked in is anything but bland.  I like spicy food and have a pretty high tolerance for heat, but I'll admit the first bite of the water boiled fish caught me off guard. This dish was spicy! But once I got used to the heat, the other flavors easily came through - and boy, there were a lot of flavors. Garlic, cilantro, cloves, ginger, green onion, and plenty of smoky chile. I'm not sure what kind of fish was used (some variety of mild white fish) but it was delicious and soaked up the flavors of the broth along with the cabbage. The portion was enormous, easily three meals - and at $9.95 it was a bargain. I also ordered the green onion pancake, which was fresh, hot, crispy, and did not disappoint. I fully intend on revisiting this place and working my way through their enticing menu. \n\nThe restaurant itself is clean and functional, but nothing fancy, so if you're looking for over-the-top Asian ambiance you won't find it here. What you will find is yummy food, huge portions, great prices, and friendly service. I highly recommend!",

So when my parents moved away from Brandon and to Town n Country, I was glad to have this South Tampa location also.\n\nJust as I (probably) said in my Brandon location review, Green Island boba is THE BEST and my favorite! I always compare other places to Green Island, and rarely do the others ever win. They just know how to cook the tapioca just right and make the drinks with the correct flavors.\n\nThe only thing is that this location does not have frozen yogurt like Brandon. So you don't get to add some fro yo to your smoothie to make it creamier. They also have separate rewards cards, so you can't use the Brandon punch card at the Tampa store and vice versa.\n\nI feel bad for the girl who is all alone on her shift when I come in because I always roll in with friends and family aka almost 10 people. So she gets bombarded with our orders. Poor girl needs help! We always have to wait, so it's nice to have the games to entertain us.",

I remember coming in with her before the salon area had been added. I'd always been intrigued over the unique variety of merchandise along with how clean and orderly the place was. These both still hold true to this day. \n\nSkin Deep may appear to be a ladies' only place to shop, but the reality is that they do have a selection of mens' skincare items along with a good variety of unisex items. I love their Jack Black line and feel that this place has the best selection of their merchandise in town. They also offer an impressive selection of candles - I'm a fan of the Voluspa brand and you can find many of their scents here. \n\nI was in here not too long ago to make an exchange and felt that the customer service was unparalleled. The woman whom had assisted me was friendly and knowledgeable, and really made the process a smooth one. Skin Deep is open during Covid but is taking extra measures such as providing a credit card sanitizing machine which I felt was a smart idea. \n\nI'll be back!",

A bison patty covered in melted cheddar cheese, smoky bacon and BBQ sauce. It came with a side of fries and lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion to dress the patty.\n\nTed's has a number of different burger combinations, from the simple Naked burger to the Avalon, a burger with melted Gruyère with a hint of Bleu cheese, crumbled bacon and sweet caramelized onions, roasted garlic aioli and baby arugula.

Here's why:\n\nThe staff are great, and friendly, and pay attention that your beer glass is never empty, and are helpful with welcoming new additions to your table (always nice- they were accommodating on two occasions recently and I really appreciate that).\n\nThe beer list is extensive and has lots of local brews (Yards, Stoudts, Victory, Flying Fish, and Troegs seem to be the usual suspects so far), and it gets switched up enough to keep it interesting. A wine-drinking friend approved of their wine list , though I haven't examined it in detail myself.\n\nThe bar snacks are tasty (spinach dip on Yards pumpernickel bread? yes please! and fried pickles! oh my), and the full menu has a great variety (try the Mediterranean chopped salad- delicious and big enough to share), including a dish or two with ingredients from that morning's farmers' market... I love that!\n\nPlenty of tv screens to keep an eye on the Phillies (or the Flyers or whoever else, I suppose), so it's a great place to watch a game... though I can't recommend sitting at the bar unless you're off in the corner, it gets crowded and people shout in your ear as they try to order drinks.\n\nSwift Half gets two thumbs up!",

It was very light and flavorful for it being a risotto and honestly I was very impressed. \n\nThe only dish we were not impressed by was the millionaire tart dessert which was very heavy in the chocolate department.

All of the other components were top notch as well, and it was big enough that I had a couple slices remaining to bring home and snack on later.

  "text": "Summary: Beautiful space with friendly, attentive staff and deliciously flavored meals. A great concept for a restaurant in this generation--no tipping required. I love the idea that the owners are giving their staff a living wage and benefits to boot. (Tip anyway! Everything is great!)\n\nI visited with a party of three others on Girard's second night open--11/22/14. The entire place was running like a well-oiled machine, which can be suprising for a place that just opened. \n\nThe only hiccup of our visit was that there seemed to be some kind of misunderstanding for my friends order with the waitress... But I have to chalk it up to it being the restaurants second day.\n\nI ordered a prixe fix meal because it was a great deal-- App, meal, dessert for fair price. I had celery soup to start--the flavor was amazing and not what I was expecting. It tasted like amazing thanksgiving day stuffing somehow. There was not a drop left in my bowl. I had the roast beef as my main--very tender--and the horseradish sauce was amazing. For dessert I had the chocolate tart. It was very good! But if you're not a huge fan of chocolate, I would either share it or get a different dessert as its one of those chocolate desserts that leaves you full after a few spoonfuls.\n\nThe rest of my party savored and  enjoyed their food as well. We all tried  a little of each other's. The avocado toast was sooo good! The flavors are so tasty--it was even a little spicy. The burger was amazing and the potatoes are so so good! I've been craving the burger and potatoes since we've been there. The philly muffin the burger comes on is so nice and crusty. I also tried my wife's pumpkin creme brûlée and it was amazing. It was smooth and light. We all also shared a charcuterie plate--amazing!!\n\nI can't wait to return to try their breakfast foods--they're served all day! \n\nThe atmosphere was lovely: the decor is modern--I like the yellow and black color palette. The space is cozy, but you don't feel like you're sitting on top of other diners--which I hate. The vibe is chill, but fancy. The staff is knowledgable, friendly, and attentive. The owners and lovely--the chef comes up with the best flavor combos! \n\nMAKE YOUR RESERVATION!",

Without a doubt, my favorite lunch place in Santa Barbara and maybe the world. \n\nThe menu may seem limited, but trust me, it's got everything it needs. The chicken crack bowl is so addicting once you try it, it probably is like crack. I assume that's why they named it that? The only issue I take with it is that the quinoa to kale ratio is a little off. No one needs that much quinoa, especially not in one sitting.  Also, the kale has been a little too salty lately, hopefully they will fix that. \n\n\nTheir prosciutto open faced sandwich with goat cheese and arugula and onions and other amazing flavors is also a favorite. Also the avocado meets toast is absolutely incredible! Ahh I love this place, I miss it so much when I'm not in Santa Barbara. Everything here is good, I really want to try their chia dessert. I want to try it all. If you're in SB/Carpinteria area, you absolutely have to go to food liaison.

I was here with a group on Friday afternoon at 4 pm and it was crowded, which is great I love when this place is packed because the energy is amazing. However, at the bars, there are always lines at the service stations. I understand that you can walk up to anywhere at the bar to get a drink but when there is only one bartender serving guests and the bar back is just prepping fruit the service timing is still the same. Just as someone who has worked in bars my entire life I remember getting in two hours prior to service in order to prep for the night that way all my attention can be given to the guests and I can make the most possible tips I can while I'm there. Also, the lack of servers on the floor at 4 pm when it's a Friday afternoon is not beneficial to the common goal of the bar making money and people wanting to drink after a long week of working. \n\nSo this is just a long way of saying, that they need more staff and bartenders be a little quicker.",

This time I ordered the regular Cuban and a side of Tostones (smashed green plantains lightly fried). Cuban was good and loved the Tostones - never had them before but found these crunchy discs dipped in their Havana sauce (similar to ranch) totally addictive. BF also got a regular Cuban and fries - fries were the skinny shoestring type fried to a perfect crisp and seasoned with Lowrys - num!\n\nPlanning on trying a platter next visit (Arroz con Pollo or Lechon Asado have caught my eye). \n\nSame great waitress and great value for the price ($5.50 for Cuban + 1 side lunch special).",

  "text": "The greatest spa ever! I went here with somebody else. Walked past the Salon but I just used the Spa services. \n\nLocated downstairs it is a beautiful place. Once you get out of your clothes and get into a robe you wait in the lobby area with comfy couches and a star lit ceiling. There is a big ball with water flowing out of the top of it in the middle of the lobby area. All of this is very relaxing. As you wait they offer you homemade Ginger cookies, water (with either cucumber, orange, or lemon slices in it), wine, and other refreshments as you wait. \n\nThe first thing I got was a facial. It was very soothing and relaxing. Once the lady specialist was finished she wrote down on a card everything she used on my face and gave it to me. I had the option to buy them later when I left. \n\nNext I had a relaxing soak. It was a 20 minute soak and the water was very warm/almost hot. Very  soothing. The water smelled of lavender and other soothing fragrances. After that was over I finished with an hour Swedish massage. They really concentrated on spots that I wanted them to focus in on and they asked many questions before to make sure everything was okay. \n\nOnce that was over I returned to the lobby and they told me to drink plenty of water. I felt so relaxed and I slept like a baby that night. This is the spot to be. This is where you will forget about everything and just relax. If you don't like their music just bring your iPod and you will be just fine.\n\nThese are just the things I received on my . They have many other massages, facials, scrubs, soaks, manicures, pedicures, and other things they can do to pamper your body. I would tell anyone to go here. If you want to go alone, with a buddy, someone you love, girls night, or for the bridal party this is perfect for anyone!",

It took me back to middle school when I would go to the \"all nighters\" at the local skating rink ( you know what I am talking about Britt S). The smell of sweaty feet and popcorn. We were lucky enough to go on a night when they had  \"Winter Wonderland\" skating- lights off and a few Christmas trees scattered on the edges. Its about $10 per person and you can skate for as long as \"free skate\" is available. The actual rink was much colder than I expected and I wished I would have brought gloves. My date and I went around a few times and then called it quits. I think we were there for a total of 30 mins. Overall it was a good time and I am glad we can mark it off our winter to do list.",

Don't expect anything fancy,, but the space is large, clean, bright, and comfortable. Cash only is a bummer, but there is an ATM on site.\n\nFor the pho, you can choose Med or Large bowl. In other words, are you hungry or super duper hungry? The difference is only a $1! Luckily, I ordered the medium bowl ($6.75) because that large bowl was HUGE! Today, I felt like eye-round, brisket, and flank! At our table, we also ordered the house special pad thai (small portion, but good!), and a few orders of the spring and summer rolls. Our pho came out before the appetizer rolls, but I'm not complaining. I was excited for my hot bowl of pho! The pho was average at best, but the summer rolls were very good!\n\nDecent place for pho, especially in this area.",

You can enjoy being in the thick of the action without the tourists and the smells. The vibe of the lofts where some of the galleries are is so unique and fun.\n\n2. It's free: yes, free! Also a free shuttle to take you from gallery to gallery.\n\n3. Food/drink: some of the galleries have snacks and wine out for guests strolling through. \n\n4. Art: the art itself is so diverse, you can go to this event 4 Saturday's in the same month and see completely different things each time. It's not mundane or repetitive, it's new and fresh each time. Some of the art is available for purchase if you are in the market for a different style piece for your home or apartment. Some crazy expensive, but some absolutely affordable!\n\n5. Culture: there are so many people who come out to the event, it's a great way to meet people who might not normally cross your path. \n\nAll in all, a unique event and a lovely way to spend a Saturday night in the city.  Wear your walking shoes!",

  "text": "Why come here?\n\n1) $16 dollars a month ($10 to start IRC)\nMost gyms have monthly plans from $40-60. Other than an extra fee a few months into it, this is the most economical gym membership you can get. Technically, the USF gym is cheaper but I m not enrolling in class again there just for the gym lol.\n\nI''ll be honest. I've tried other gyms close by like the old Gold Gym in City Plaza or Lifestyle Gym on Amberly (That one changes identities more than most folks change clothes. IIRC it's Captain Crunch now?). The problem with those places was lack of cardiovascular  machines. A lot of people would socialize there and hog the machines. Lame. (Also my wallet was stolen there many years ago and they were very apathetic and unhelpful in retrieving it)\n\n2) Youfit has a boatload of treadmills,stationary bikes,ellipticals, and steppers. It's rare that one would ever have to wait for one. \nAs you enter , there are cardiovascular machines on the left , weight machines in the middle, and \"free weights\" on the right. There is a group exercise room towards the left side that has been added in the time that I've joined(I haven't taken any classes there so I cant comment on them. Melony R's review goes into detail)\n\n3) Another thing I like is that there are multiple hand towels/sanitizer stations around. I've only used the bathrooms a handful of times but they were mostly clean when I did. \n\n4) This is purely subjective, but as a comic book fan, I love the purple/green motif inside. Joker, Green Goblin, and Devastator would LOVE it here!\n5) They are open during many national holidays (at reduced hours) \n\nSince this branch is close to USF, its mostly populated by a diverse crowd. . Regular or bigger folks attend without worry about feeling out of place with stylish soccer moms like those aforementioned gyms. \n\nThe only negatives would probably be the parking lot. It is shared with a Hertz rental place and MD oriental market. I have had a hubcap stolen while working out once (Jokes on them. It was a plastic Walmart one)\nWhile its not dangerous, I would use caution at night.\n\nOverall, whether youre hardcore or softcore, its a great place to work out.",

I placed the order around 11:30am for pick up at 1:15pm and the food was just going into the containers as we were walking in.  I really liked that it was ready as close to the pick up time as possible to be as fresh as possible.  \n\nI ordered the Classic Gyro with feta and fries; man-oh-man, it was BOMB.  The meat was tender and flavorful with the right balance of feta, lettuce and onion.  The pita was warm and pliable though I had to grab a fork about 3-4 bites in because of it's size.  The fries were pretty good considering they were in a styrofoam container for 15-20 mins.  I was a little upset that we didn't have ketchup at the office, but OPA saved the day by including some in my tray.  The Tzatziki was amazing.  So flavorful and lots of it.  Get some extra pita to go along with the order, they give you so much sauce.  The hummus was good too; very garlicky and I love that.  Over all I really want to have a dine in experience very soon.  Especially before 4:30pm because they have lots of lunch specials.",

  "text": "All hail Iron Chef Jose Garces!  I made a same day reservation - dinner for 2 at 9:30 on a Saturday night.  Top notch atmosphere, seemingly effortless service and bold food.  If you read nothing else, know that they are selling autographed copies of Garces' book Latin Evolution for $35 (what a steal!!).\n\nWe sat in the front dining room - cool yet dark in its color scheme, with shutter-lined walls for added perceptual depth and large high metal ceiling fans spinning slowly overhead.  I love the contrast between this room and the warm reddish-orange glow of the back dining room (mostly for larger parties). \n\nFrancesco was one of the best waiters we've had in a long time!  At once his friendly disposition and knowledge of the menu made us feel at ease in his capable hands.  He informed me of special vegetarian options (tofu buns & red curry without crab) and made excellent drink recommendations (white sangria with heavy orange flavors for my date).  \n\nOf the many dishes we ordered, the Red Curry Del General and Arroz Con Pato were our favorites.  Both portions were fairly large.  Only the Chupe was disappointing.  It had a slow poached egg inside which gave the dish a runny consistency - something that my boyfriend didn't enjoy.  The Yuca fries would make a great bar food, just be sure to stir up the dipping sauce in the bottom of the cup.\n\nIn general the dishes were mildly spicy, surprisingly sweet, less salty than Tinto and larger portions than Amada.",

I've had it a million times but wasn't sure what to expect here!\n\nIt's kind of like Chipotle or Port of Subs in that you choose a couple items and they mix it up for you. There are several base selections like rice or mixed greens (I went with mixed greens to stay a little healthy). Then you choose your protein like salmon, tuna, tofu, yellowtail, shrimp, etc. (I chose salmon). Then you choose your sauce like shoyu sesame, spicy mayo, and there's a couple others (I chose shoyu). Then you get to add toppings from a big list. The crab salad was stupid good, I could have eaten a bowl of just that. There's little veggies, seasonings, ginger, and so much more.\n\nI loved almost everything about this. Service was speedy and super friendly, price was very reasonable, fish was fresh, toppings and mixed greens were fresh and tasty! My main complaint is the counter for guests to eat at was a little dirty but they were crazy busy with only two employees so I can't really fault them there. The food was picturesque, I had a hard time mixing it because my bowl was so full (YAY). My only other comment is just that I prefer when my fish has more time to marinate in the sauce which is more of a personal preference and isn't feasible in this set up.\n\nOther than being super busy and a personal preference issue, I loved this! GET CRAB SALAD ON TOP ITS AMAZING! (Honestly, I'm on a diet and I think I was just all about the mayo)",

  "text": "Very disappointing.. I think my expectations were way too high! We sought this place out because it was on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives. Of course, Guy Fieri loved it. I, on the contrary, was very displeased. \nYou walk in, and the atmosphere is fun and casual. There's bright colors, signs all over the walls, long picnic tables, and smaller tables for seating. You order at the counter. If you get a soda, or any other non-alcoholic beverage, they give it you right there and you're welcome to grab a table. If you order a beer, you have to walk to the next counter. There, you have to wait for someone over the age of 18 to serve your beer. It took several minutes. We stood there going, 'are we at the right counter? I see the beer. There's just nobody around to get it for us.' Finally, someone came and asked, \"what did you have?\" They entered the order into an iPad. Everything is in your system, and yet you have no idea what beers to give us. \nWhen your order is ready, they call your number. Most people walked up to the counter and grabbed their tray. We assumed our food would be delivered to our table, so when they called our number, we stayed seated, and they brought it to us. \nI ordered the Kid Brother Sampler: 4oz pulled pork, 4oz brisket and choice of 2 sides. I liked the pulled pork. That's the best I can say. The brisket was only 3 slices, with a 1/2 inch strip of fat running through the middle. By the time I trimmed the fat, I was left with very little meat. I chose hushpuppies and corncake for my sides. Both were terrible. The hushpuppies were very dark brown in color, and they tasted dry and overcooked. The corncake was different than what I expected. It was a pancake made of cornbread batter. Had it been executed properly, it probably could've been pretty good. It was not! It, too, was burnt, overcooked and dry. \nI will not be be giving this place a second chance.",

  "text": "Ah, I see I have been beaten to this review by the other fellow Yelpers that I had my meal with, Alan L. and Joy W, but here's my two-cent anyway!\n\nDecor: Small, intimate cafe-style.I went for dinner and I could see how this could have been some lively spot for lunch and then they immediately transform it to something a bit more intimate for dinner. Seating is limited to that one room and for that Wednesday night, most tables were filled.\n\nService: Our waiter was nice and accommodating. But I have to emphasize how LONG we waited for the food- one hour plus?! Not okay. If you had better food, you would have (maybe) been forgiven by my taste buds, but my stomach and brain did not like the wait at all! And there were tables who got there later than we did and got served first (though they still had to wait a substantial amount of time.) Not a fair policy at all.\n\nFood: \n- I got the beef linguine special, which I found nothing special at all. The pasta, I could tell, was homemade because of the nice chewy texture, but the beef, sauce and the toppings were very so-so. The goat cheese was also overpowering- goat cheese, being such a pungent cheese, needs only a small amount or else it would overpower all the other ingredients. And since the pasta had no taste and the beef didn't have a flavourful sauce, the goat cheese drowned it all (I had to push it all aside). \n- Wine was only $3! Granted, it wasn't great wine, so don't get all your hopes up, lol. I wonder if the wine was (relatively) local too...?\n\nOverall: I'm so disheartened by this place, because I love supporting locally-owned places that, even better, serve locally grown food. But Local Harvest, oh, how you disappointed me so!",

  "text": "So I had it again with fresh onions.\n\nCompared to Tony Luke's roast pork (my favorite), \n1. it's juicier\n2. it's bigger (more meat)\n3. it has much better bread (sesame-crusted and crustier)\n4. the wait is much less painful than Tony Luke's which can take about 20 minutes to get you the sandwich on a crowded day (really not sure why it takes so freakin long).\n\nBut I prefer the Tony Luke's roast pork taste. John's Roast pork sandwich has very heavy pork smell to it; not sure if they use less spices to kill the smell...but I guess to some folks who love the porky smell, they'd like this aspect of the sandwich. Be sure to get rabe and fresh cut onions which helps to cut the smell down a bit.",

  "text": "This truly was one of the best dining experiences of my little life so far. The turtle soup is as good as everyone says, the pecan encrusted fish was dreamy, and the souffle was puffy and chewysweetspicy and I could eat it every day. The champagne and wine recommendations were crazy good. \n\nMost outstanding and noticeable of all is the quality of service at Commander's Palace. Nothing compares. Everyone who wants to work in service should train here. Every single person we walked by who works here in any capacity gave us an incredibly warm welcome like we were dear old friends and beloved regulars. Every person at our table of 10 received personalized recommendations and considerate, focused, attentive care. The way each course is served, with synchronized, balletic precision, is breathtaking but then the moment your plate is placed in front of you, your waiter checks in with you to make sure you have what you need in this distinctly Southern, friendly, unpretentious way that makes the choreographed moment so much sweeter. \n\nThe design of the original dining room took my breath away, and the garden room was lovely too. I'd love to eat at the table in the wine bunker someday, but since the president sat in the garden room I can't imagine who this even-more-exclusive room is reserved for... Beyoncé probably. I can dream.",

That's a statement, so we had to check it out for ourselves, especially since we recently committed to a vegetarian diet. \n\nI concur that their lentil walnut burger is the best vegan burger I have ever eaten (and I've had a fair share!). They truly make it \"gourmet.\" The innovativeness of beet ketchup, coconut cheese, and chickpea mayo blew me away. Even their bun was tasty and didn't feel like a cheap filler. It satisfied me to the depth of a real burger. \n\nService was a little blasè, and I was disappointed their kombucha flavor was coffee based when I was craving something more fruity and refreshing. Luckily their burger is good enough to keep me coming back, and I love that vegan ice cream is the next shop down!",

The Vinh Special has oxtail, meatballs, and thin slices of beef.  It's very flavorful!  My go to appetizer is the Shrimp sliders! It has fresh, pickled veggies.  The shrimp is flat topped grilled.  I love having jalapeños on this!  The creamy Cajun aoli gives the slider a touch of spice.  I liked the lemongrass wings but I didn't love it!

  "text": "Chef Bye has crafted something incredible with Ampersand 27--a stylish and unique concept that feeds off a family dining experience, variations in texture, and edgy menu items that offer just the right amount of daring. I came, I ate, and I was charmed.\n\nThere's nothing quite like walking into a stunningly decorated restaurant and being presented with two plentiful charcuterie boards: wooden platters overflowing with an abundance of Ampersand 27's specialties. Cheddars, bleus, chevres paired with mounds of your favourite salumi: chorizo, prosciutto, genoa--accompanied by pickles, mustards, grains, and the most decadently creamy duck and chicken liver pate you'll ever taste.\n\nAs part of their media event, I was subject to a flurry of tastings from their menu, as per below.\n\nBeet Texture: A dainty salad of roasted, gelled, and crisp beets, served with sous vide and goat cheese ganache. Beautifully different for those who don't usually eat beets, or who generally think all beets are served pickled. I thoroughly enjoyed the sweet and savoury flavours of this dish.\n\nConfit Parsnip: Sliced parsnip served with gremolata, pine nut, red pepper dust, and jam. A creamier take on the average parsnip and one that combined flavours together that were completely new to me. A nice dish, although I did prefer the Beet Texture.\n\nThe Living Salad: Ah, The Living Salad. Order this and you'll be presented with a mini tree trunk hosting a plant pot of local micro greens and a jar of cold pressed canola emulsion. And scissors, so that you can harvest your own salad. It's a really cute concept, especially for those who think the novelty of cutting your own salad at dinner is exciting. For $15, though, it's a fairly pricey novelty--especially for just a handful of micro greens.\n\nMaple Butter Pork Belly: It's pretty difficult to screw up pork belly. Add some maple butter and Chef Bye's inimitable talent, though, and you've got a winner of a dish. A true homage to the south, the pork belly was served with southwestern mesquite corn, baked beans, green peas, and fritters. Lovely and savoury.\n\nPastrami Pork Cheeks: I feel like this dish is Chef Bye's sharing menu's understated pièce de résistance. Coming out under a glass dome (reminiscent of the one covering the rose in Beauty and the Beast), the pastrami pork cheeks are unveiled amidst a heady, charcoal-scented haze of smoke--the smell of which will incite memories of barbeques, smoked meats, and everything good and smoky and tender. Served with braised red cabbage, rye spaetzle, and sauerkraut creme, this dish is delicious and exciting. I strongly recommend giving it a try.\n\nSeared Albacore Tuna: Almost every restaurant in Edmonton has a version of seared tuna or tuna tataki at the moment. It's become a popular dish, particularly for those who aren't quite ready for sashimi but want the flavour and texture of not-quite-cooked tuna. Ampersand 27's version takes the seafood aspect a little more seriously than most, serving the tuna with pickled hearts of palm, citrus, seaweed, and cashew puree. The result is a seared tuna dish that's a little more fishy than I'm used to, but that combines some interesting textures and flavours together that will surprise even the most veteran of seared tuna-goers.\n\nThe Seashore: This dish offered scallops, prawns, smoked trout brandade, and sea asparagus. A lovely option for seafood-lovers, The Seashore combined some of my favourite under-the-sea items and made them taste spectacular. Scallops. I'm always for the scallops.\n\nRocky Road: For dessert, we were treated to a taste of Ampersand 27's Rocky Road, a selection of \"rocks\" that have a hard shell and liquid interior and are served on edible \"moss and sand.\" In continuation of the restaurant's attention to textures, this dessert is unique and delicious with a beautiful presentation. The \"rocks\" come in chocolate, mint, mango, and lychee flavours.\n\nNeaveau Misu: The restaurant's most popular dessert is a modern take on tiramisu--a toffee pudding served with coffee caramel, amaretto, hazelnut, and brown butter, topped off with a side of macaron and ice cream. Bring me any kind of toffee pudding and I'm satisfied, but this one was exceptional. This was my favourite dessert of the evening.\n\nCitron Bleu: The Citron Bleu is a light, delicate serving of lemon buttermilk mousse alongside a portion of blueberries, earl grey gel and milk crisps. Lovely and sweet, this dessert is a must-try for those who like fruity and tart flavours.\n\nI was very impressed by Ampersand 27. I strongly recommend this restaurant with one small word of warning: it isn't cheap. A single charcuterie with two meats, two cheeses, and a few accompaniments can easily shoot past the $20 price range into the $30s and $40s, depending on what you order. Sharing plates range from $11 to $19 and the full meals start at $23. It's not overpriced, by any means, but be wary of those charcuterie boards if you're on a budget.",

  "text": "I waited a good 5-10 minute wait for someone to notice me at the counter. This is so pricey for the portion of food. I ordered a soy sauce ramen with no vegetables with teriyaki chicken on the side and karaage chicken. Also a sprite which was like $3 for a clear party cup filled with ice. In all, my total came to be $20.52 including tax. \n\nThe karaage chicken is worth it to be a meal of its own since they give you a giant portion for $7 along with a kind of vinegary soy sauce. Very crispy and not good if you keep it for leftovers later. \nThe soy sauce ramen was probably the saddest ramen I've seen. Even my instant noodles had more noodles and soup than that bowl. The noodles looked exactly like instant noodles, but at least the broth was flavorful and light enough to drink. \nThe teriyaki chicken was so good! So tasty! It was somewhat sweet and vinegary and the chicken was tender. I loved it!\nWhen I had leftovers, I tried so hard to chase them down for a bag, I really thought they were avoiding me as I walked towards them!!",

  "text": "I have nothing but praise for Joe Strauss my sales associate. He was very knowledgeable and polite. I looked at a 2015 mustang for my wife. The price was substantially below retail and still under warranty from the factory. I brought my wife to to look at it and she liked it but didn't think it was right for her. I emailed Joe and let him know we wouldn't be doing the deal. Two days later he says the car is ready for pickup. I tell him we weren't doing the deal. He was good with it. My wife decides she wants the car because we can take it back if she doesn't love it. We get the car and two days later she doesn't want it, so I call Joe to,let him know we're bringing it back. He's fine with that. Anyway, I decide on the way back, that I'll give them my car and keep the mustang. Joe is, of course, good with that too. I go back on Monday and they had to do all the paperwork over again but they did it and Joe even came into work early just to make sure everything was good. He is absolutely one of the best salespeople I have very dealt with. \n\nNow, about that missing star. When you advertise a car as looking like new, it should look like new. New cars don't have wheels that aren't spotless. New cars don't have door cards that haven't been at least wiped down to remove marks. New cars don't have dirty rear windows, dust on the tops of the back seats and a rear view mirror that was so dirty, I thought it was condensation. These things might be acceptable at the local $5 car wash. Not at a place that says the car will look like new. \n\nStep up your game, just a bit. OK?",

  "text": "Great new healthy food concept, decided to give it a try while visiting family in the area.  Decor is bright and inviting.  Menus available as you walk in.  Ordering was pretty straight forward if you choose one of the suggested menu items, they asked if we wanted everything that was designed to come with it, much appreciated.   The ingredients on display looked fresh and appealing.  I loved the creamy tomato soup made with pureed cauliflower, really rich without the heaviness of a traditional cream soup.   My salad was mixed thoroughly so that the dressing coated all ingredients.   Hard to see the menu beverage board, I think this is just how the building was designed, but not good from a selling standpoint.   Overall it was a really positive experience.  I think to make it better, more attention needs to be paid to the dining room area, there was several tables that had not been cleaned up and debris on the floor.  Also, as a new concept, it would be nice to be greeted and asked if we had been there before, it is an opportunity to better explain how the menu and ordering work.",

  "text": "United Cab has restored my faith in mankind and cabbies everywhere!!! This review is about TWO experiences. My boyfriend and I were in New Orleans for Mardi Gras 2014. We were having a great time partying, foodie adventuring, spending time with old friends & seeing the sights (it was his first time in the 504). It was Lundi Gras, we were determinedly weathering the brutal 30 degree winds coming from the Mississippi River while enjoying downtown festivities. I had only consumed 2 beverages and somehow managed to lose not only my photo ID, but later that evening upon arriving back to our friends home, my boyfriend reluctantly informs me that he doesn't have his phone. (his iPhone 5 with a life-proof case and all the photos we had taken the whole weekend- he is not tech savvy and up until recently did not have his iCloud enabled, which means 'find my phone' feature was also disabled). Ughhhhh. Talk about frustration. He told me he had it in the cab. So it must've fallen while exiting.  \nLet me rewind a bit and preface our frustration by saying that in all the rush that comes with parades, it took us nearly two hours to find a cab, and when we finally did we were so excited and exhausted that we literally didn't notice the cab company, drivers name or car number. Yikes! Picture me on my phone at 2am frantically calling every NOLA cab company I could find on yelp. All I could remember: male driver & black/white striped minivan. The dispatch operator assured me she'd send my info to any drivers on duty that night. And even gave me a lost & found number to call the next day. Well come that morning (Mardi Gras morning), I still hadn't heard anything. And my call to lost and found proved fruitless since pretty much EVERYTHING Is closed on Mardi Gras day. I forgot that it's a friggin national holiday in these parts. Feeling defeated and irritated about losing so many memories AND having to spend another $500 on a phone, we decided to just stay in. Avoid the cold rain. Straight up drown our sorrows. As we're sitting on our friends sofa, catching up on 'The Walking Dead season 4, we hear a knock at their front door. I was hesitant about answering since we don't live there but my boyfriend's curiosity got the best of him. He answered and I turned to see him walking out the door to follow this man. This peaked MY curiosity so I got up, ran to the door, and what do I see???  The cab we rode in the night before sitting in the driveway. THE CABBIE BROUGHT OUR PHONE BACK. Apparently he had our address in the GPS and said another passenger found it and gave it to him. WHATTTTTTTT!???? I have never heard of anyone ever ever ever having an iPhone returned to them, especially while on vacation.  Thank God for the cold rain that day, thank God we decided to stay in!!!\nIT WAS OUR MARDI GRAS MIRACLE!!! We tipped him generously, but again, forgot to get his name. Wahh Wahh. \n\nOur second experience was on our way to the airport heading home. Our driver's name (we were sure to get it this time) was Nancy. She's been with the company for like 20yrs. She was lovely and chatty and so personable. She even gave me her cell number to call her next time we're in town. I definitely will! Thank you Nancy and all of United Cab! Amazing service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nPS I never did find my ID, but replaced it soon after. About time I invested in a Florida ID anyway. ;-)",

  "text": "ZolliKoffee is a great and welcomed addition to the Jackaloupe Brewing company.  I love the opportunity to have a different brew under the same roof.  Plus, whenever the food trucks are posted in front of the brewery, you are guaranteed for some exceptional cafe fare.\n\nFirst off, the iced coffee is my favorite.  They use Klatch coffee which is amazing.  The coffee is cold brewed and is not acidic to the taste.  My second favorite is the Chai Lattes.  They make their own blend so it is very unique.  I like a Chai that does not overpower the taste buds.\n\nAll the pastry treats are homemade.  I love the rice krispy treats with chunks of chocolate and the chocolate muffins they have on hand as well.  When I am not binging on chocolate, the sandwiches are also a favorite of mine.  I love the Turkey, Cheese and Habenero Pineapple Sammy.\n\nThis is a great place to go if you want to entertain guests that like both beer and coffee.  It is literally the best of both worlds.\n\nAlso, I belive there is a $4 credit min on cards.  Bring cash if you just want a cup of joe.",

  "text": "I've been to the 12 South location several times and have loved it. So when I heard they had a second location, I had to go. The new location is on Charlotte so it's much calmer than 12 South. I recognized the building right away because it very much resembles the 12 South building. The best thing is they have a big parking lot! You should have no problem finding a spot. \n\nWhen walking in, it's about the same setup as the other location. You grab a menu, walk up to the register, and order your food/drinks. You order individual tacos so you can try several different types. They take your name and then you sit wherever you like. I love the interior of this place. Very clean and simple but beautiful. I especially love the patio area. It's heated in the winter and it looks like in the warmer weather they can open the windows. \n\nWithin 5 minutes of sitting down our chips and queso came. My favorite part. Their queso is soooooooooooooo good. I dream about their queso. 2 minutes later, our tacos arrived. I always get the brisket tacos. So juicy and delicious. My boyfriend got the Memphis taco and an enchilada. The enchilada is smothered in a red sauce and cheese. Yum. Everything was so good and it's all at a great price. The staff is always really friendly and the owner has greeted us at both locations. I love love love this place and will for sure be a regular.",

I had a great time and even got called on stage to 'twerk it'. Free shot too!\n\n#winning",

  "text": "Out of all the restaurants I visited in Clearwater, Columbia was definitely one of my favorites! We had a group of 12, so a friend called ahead to make a reservation. Fortunately, it wasn't too busy and we didn't have to worry about not having a table. I do wish we had been seated on the porch next to the water because the views were so beautiful! \n\nWe had one server at our table and she was outstanding. Our group started off with two different sangrias. I LOVED the white wine sangria. You can order a pitcher that has enough for 4-5 glasses. It was the perfect mix of sweetness and I love that our server mixed it in front of us at the table. It definitely had tons of alcohol, but you could barely notice it.\n\nThe menu was had a variety of options. The first few pages had tapas, then moved to entrees. I am a huge fan of croquettes, so I got the special lobster and crab croquettes. They were absolutely delicious. The inside was warm and the outside was very crispy. It was a huge hit at our table. Someone ordered an appetizer of tomatoes and I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of the dish. There were a few other tapas plates that I tried that I can't remember off the top of my head, but I don't think you will be disappointed with any option.\n\nEveryone who tried the paella raved about it, so I chose the seafood one. I'm not a huge fan of paella, but I actually liked it. WARNING: this dish is huge and probably good to share between 3-4 people. Unfortunately, I was so full after the tapas that I felt like I barely touched this plate! My friend had one of the fish dishes, and I loved that the fish was soft and easy to break off with a fork.\n\nDefinitely a must try in Clearwater if you're looking for a fancier dinner!",

The setting was intimate, making this one of the best concerts I've ever attended! I was definitely not expecting to be standing so close to a band that I absolutely love. \n\nThey had outdoor bars set up, so drinks were easily accessible albeit expensive.  The restrooms were inside but unfortunately, they were leaking this night, so the floors were sopping wet with ladies in there trying to mop it all up, making for an overly crowded mess. Despite that, the place has a lot of character inside and it was so nice to enjoy good music al fresco. I will be excited to attend another concert at this venue in the future.",

Our 2 - bedroom with a kitchenette for 2 adults and 3 kids under 11 was definitely worth it's weight in gold.  \nThe views from our second floor room overlooking the golf course and surrounding areas were astounding. The workout gym was decent and the pool /hot tub was even better. They even have a machine for people with body movement issues available for lowering in the water. \n\n   Everyone from the cleaning staff to the security guard at the front gate seemed friendly and in good spirits. \n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bugs. I understand; it's near the mountains, nature and all of that.\nIt wasn't anything too bad, just a few spiders and some ladybug-sized critters. The room provided bug spray and we took advantage of that.\n- Streetlights, or the lack of them. I also get it's an exclusive club; maybe streetlights bother some, but at night especially out there, it would've been nice. The parking lot also, but that gets a pass because  they provided lit walkways.\n\nWhat I loved:\nThe digital thermostat; high tech, just like on TV and the movies!! (Sorry, I geek - out at the littlest things!).\n\nOverall, we had a great time here. Highly recommended.",

  "text": "I know I shouldn't judge a place for something they're not known for, but I'm about to do it. My boyfriend and I went to Lafayette Square for a house tour yesterday and wanted to get brunch beforehand. Square One's brunch menu sounded really good, so I made an OpenTable reservation the night before. We were seated quickly, and the service was generally stellar throughout the experience. Unfortunately, the food was not. We ordered a Belgian waffle to share which was okay, but not outstanding. I don't know if it needed more butter in the batter or what, but it is not often that I am dissatisfied by a waffle. The real trouble came with my main dish. I ordered the Irish Skillet (I think that's what it was called) which was supposed to be corned beef hash with eggs. I am a CBH aficionado, so I was very much looking forward to it. Upon taking my first bite, my excitement dwindled. I kid you not...the hash was so spicy my nose was running after two or three bites. I have no idea why it was so spicy because the menu mentioned nothing about heat in the dish. Granted, I absolutely LOVE spicy food and the idea of hot corned beef hash is kind of intriguing, but this was so spicy that it was painful. It was the kind of spicy that you regret, and I did. I asked our waitress what made it so hot, and she said it normally wasn't and they must have over-seasoned it. Even before we got up to leave, I knew that heat would haunt me during our house tour, and it did. I had heartburn and indigestion for most of the day which really sucked. I have rarely in my life wasted food, but I didn't even take my leftovers as it was just too hot and my stomach was already upset. Generally, if I order really spicy food, I know there is a possibility I will suffer for it. What sucks is I didn't order spicy food, at least according to the menu. I will be back in the future to try the beer, but I will most certainly be skeptical if I'm ever ordering food again.",

He finds a beautiful tantalum ring in his size and looks great on him.

The girls who were working, (I am completely blanking on their names but the date was 10/15/19) were amazing. They showed us his ring and I got to pick my band, another from the Disney Collection. One of the associates persuaded us to sign up for a Zales account. I was approved so I was able to purchase both rings with warranties and no hassle. The girls showed us the Marilyn collection, which is stunning by the way! They had so much info and answered all of our questions. Thanks for your help!",

  "text": "TruFusion is the gym I've been looking for! I love premium group training classes and heated yoga but struggled to find a gym that provided both variety in classes and affordability. I've practiced Bikram yoga for several years and was heartbroken when my gym closed this past year. I wasn't thrilled with the other Bikram studios in town and they were far more expensive than what I had been paying so it just wasn't a good fit for me. I also enjoyed boot camp type training at places like Shred415 but again, the price point was just too high to justify going often or buying a membership. \n\nI read about TruFusion and asked my friends about it but they had never heard of it before. After researching the website it seemed to be too legit to not have hidden costs somewhere but I committed before the gym even opened hoping it would be everything it seemed. The gym just opened on Thursday and I've been to two classes so far. It's everything I had hoped it would be! Don't judge them by the nondescript exterior that it shares with Wine and Cheese Place in Clayton. As soon as you walk through the door you feel like you've entered a big city premium gym. Everything is stylish, clean, high tech, and looks like they spared no expense. The locker rooms have great lighting, showers, hair dryers, etc that help you fit working out into your busy work life. The soul hot yoga studio has energetic lighting, great music, and fantastic instructors. I had never tried a yin class before but I left today feeling great and looking towards when I can be back in the gym. And to really seal the deal all of this is offered for $95/month UNLIMITED which is far better than other premium class based gyms in town. They also reward fire responders, nurses, and nonprofit workers with a discount to $72 which as a nurse I'm really grateful for!\n\nSide note, if you love Revel Kitchen they are opening their second location right inside the gym! You can have a great workout and stay on your diet all in one place. I heard they will have an ordering system you can use before your class and your food/smoothie will be waiting for you when you're done. How awesome is that?!",

  "text": "I may have found love in the form of frozen yogurt. And endless choices of frozen yogurt flavors and toppings. While I'm a grown woman, I couldn't help but feel like an 8 year old on Christmas morning when making my creation. \n\nThe business model/gimmick is genius: tons of flavors, tons of toppings, charge by the ounce. Give people huge cups, and, just like the salad bar syndrome, they will unwittingly fill their cups with so much fro-yo and toppings that it ends up being an $8-9 dessert. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it's just how it is (and brilliant business on the part of Yogo). \n\nSo if you want to maximize the bang for your buck, stick with toppings that don't weigh as much. Fruit? $$$. Sprinkles or Reese's Puffs? $. It's all in the weight, people. \n\nThat being said, I don't mind dropping dough on an indulgence once in a while, given how delicious it can be.\n\nPS~Come to Chicago and I will be a happy woman.",

I admire that R Bistro maintains their own little garden on a patch of land next to the restaurant.  Which of course was covered in snow last night :)\n\nI agree with the other reviewers who have written about the warmth and beauty of the space.  We were seated around a large round table in the cozy-yet-spacious back corner of the restaurant.\n\nWe were served some delicious warm rolls with soft butter.  \n\nI had a bowl of butternut squash soup (flavorful yet surprising in its lack of sweetness), a pear/pomegranate/blue cheese salad (wonderful), and shared the vegetarian spinach, goat cheese and mushroom frittata (beautifully presented, though a little on the bland side).  And then a slice from the gorgeous red velvet birthday cake they had brought in for the occasion.\n\nThe service was friendly, accommodating, and attentive.  Regina stopped by to say hello and check in on us.\n\nOverall it was a lovely experience and I have warm memories of last night.\n\nIt should be noted that the prices are steep.  My frittata was $18.75, which is in line with the the other entrees (non-veg entrees were in the $20-$26 range).  When compared to Recess, which charges $50 per dinner, maybe it is reasonable for the fine dining experience.",

I saw Siojo on group on offering a brown tint and shaping for 9.00. of course I yelped and saw the not so positive reviews about hair services. I didn't see any for facial waxing so i decided to take a chance and blow the 9.00.\nI arrived to a small salon that smelled amazing. There really is no where to sit or waiting area  so know this upon coming in if your a walk or have an apt and you arrive early. I explained to the receptionist/owner that i wanted to do the brown tint and waxing. She advised it would be about a 10 min wait and offered me a seat near the pedicure area. In less than 5 min i was greeted by Tasha who led me back to the waxing area. Its clean , sterile but very small. Tasha asked me about how i wear my brows, if i have ever been tinted and what look i wanted to achieve(pretty much every question someone who's a professional should ask) Since i had never been tinted she explained that each step and about the tint itself. After applying the tint she left me for about 15 min (thats how long it has to sit for ). She came back in exactly 15 min shaped my brows and discussed some of the other services they offer. Apparently there is a downstairs to this beauty boutique and they offer a full service spa in addition tho the salon. \nTasha gave me a brochure and a 20% of coupon for my next visit. I saw some of the ladies getting blowouts and was very impressed.\nI would definitely return to have the brow tint/ shaping done and maybe some additional services.",

  "text": "2.5 Stars\n\nDecent Thai food with some good items, and some fails.\n\nFried tofu to start with was marginal - it was very bland with almost no flavor, and didn't have the silky interior that I love. However, the Larb Gai appetizer, chicken mixed with chili powder, scallions, mint leaves, Thai herbs and lime juice served with sliced cabbage, was outstanding, with a fabulous, fresh flavor.\n\nFor my entrée I had the Amazing, which was anything but.  Served cool, with a cloying, sweet brown sauce on top, it was almost inedible.  I sent it back to be warmed up, but that just made it even worse. My boyfriend had their special fried rice which he liked, but they must have gotten their 'heat level' confused, because his ordered medium was extra fiery.\n\nService was just okay. They had two waiters in the restaurant, and while they were attentive at first, that dropped off as more tables arrived.  It's been ten or so years since I tried this place, and it will probably be that long before I go back.",

  "text": "California girl searching for delicious tacos in the Midwest!  I definitely found it at Bakersfield Mass Ave.  My boyfriend and I were there on a Tuesday evening.  It wasn't too crowded, but the tables were packed.  Luckily, we walked in at the right time and a belly bar table opened up.  \n\nI really liked the ambience.  It's noisy, but not so bad that you have to yell at each other across the table.  It's everything I expect a hip whiskey/tequila drinking institution to be.  Couple that with delicious street style tacos, BAM I'm sold! \n\nService was excellent.  Our waitress was very sweet and offered lots of great suggestions.  Between the two of us, we got a couple drinks, Chips and Queso, and a few tacos each.\n\nThe Chips and Queso were yummy, but it got a little too heavy towards the end for me.  My boyfriend loved every last bite of it.  The chips were really addicting.\n\nAs for the tacos, we got Fish, Hongos, Pollo Rojo, Pork Belly Pastor, and Short Rib.  It's great that they make their corn tortillas in-house.  I loved loved loved the pork belly.  It was flavorful, slightly crispy, and cooked to perfection.  The short rib taco was delicious as well.  Highly recommended!  \n\nI also ordered the sangria which was made with rose and a moscato.  It was refreshing, but a  little too sweet for my taste (should've known with the moscato).  \n\nOther details:\n\nNot a huge restaurant, but they can accommodate larger groups if you plan in advance. \n\nClean bathrooms. \n\nPaid street parking.  Plentiful on a Tuesday evening, but may be a little difficult on weekends.\n\nLocated near tons of other shops, restaurants, and boutiques.\n\nOverall, I had a positive experience.",

  "text": "Initially, I was very excited to check out the Japanese Festival at the Missouri Botanical Gardens, especially to take a tour of the Teahouse Island, which is only open once a year during this festival. Maybe I built it up too much in my head, but my experience there was okay. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't too bad. \n\nThe parking gets pretty crazy, so you may want to try to get there early so you don't have to walk as far. The gardens itself is large, though, so just know that you'll be doing a fair amount as walking regardless. \n\nRight near the entrance, there were food vendors set up (I'd say between 5-10), some of which are more authentic than others (as my husband also mentioned). However, the Japanese green tea and red bean shaved ice was super awesome! It reminded me of Taiwanese shaved ice. :] It was sweet and cold and a perfectly refreshing treat on a hot day! \n\nThere seemed to be a lot of performances and demonstrations on the schedule, but none of them had the wow factor I was looking for. Maybe I'm just too spoiled because I grew up in Orlando and I'm used to productions at Disney and Universal Studios. :P Anyway, these are the things we ended up doing: \n- Sumo demonstration: It was entertaining and funny because they took several volunteers from the crowd to participate in a few matches. \n- Cooking demo where they were making sushi: The ladies were so sweet, but their accents were on the heavy side, making it difficult to understand their instructions. Plus, I didn't really learn anything new. \n- Bonsai exhibit: I love tiny things and I love trees, so this was awesome! \n- Teahouse Island tour: It was cool to see the island and to hear a little about the history of teahouse culture, but there were questions our tour guide couldn't answer because her familiarity with the teahouse was limited (as they only give these tours once a year). \n- Ice sculpture demo: The location they picked could be improved, since so many people were crowding around making it difficult to see. It was kind of cool to see a chainsaw being used to shape the ice, but it got boring after a while. \n\nAll in all, I would go back next year, but I would do it with slightly lowered expectations. And make sure you bring a water bottle! They have water bottle filling stations throughout the park!",

My server was very nice and helpful. \n\nI love dim sum so I was really excited to try some items on their vast menu. The tripe was okay, not really my favorite and wasn't spicy in my opinion. The rolled rice noodles were a bit too firm for my liking but the shrimp filling was good. I always get the steam spare ribs and they met my expectations, pretty good. The chicken feet was okay as well, not much flavor and it was broken up and soft. The pan fried shrimp dumplings were pretty good. My friend liked the tong chow chicken lunch plate. Over all not too bad but I think I would stick to panda king for dim sum.",

The ambiance is like NYC meets NOLA with large communal table tops inside and picnic seating outside. I get a toasted bagel with avo, lettuce, tomato, and capers! Sandwiches come with delicious pickles. My friend got the Rachel sandwich and loved it.  We had a bit of a wait but the service was great! They totally made up for it by offering my friend a free drink on account of his wait. Great deli!! Highly recommend Stein's for locals and tourists alike.",

They have a great selection of furniture for most homes from current trends through traditional. Every inch of the store has furniture, home accessories and accent pieces to compliment each room from ceiling to floor. \n\nWe were immediately greeted as we entered the store. The saleswoman was friendly and asked if we were looking for anything in particular. We weren't at the time but I love browsing furniture and home decor stores. I love getting decorating ideas and adding a few pieces to update my own space.\n\nUnfortunately when I did have a couple questions the salesteam was busy with others. I could have waited longer but they weren't life or death questions requiring answers that very minute. If I were purchasing I would have made a point to wait.\n\nPrices varied from average prices to overpriced. There was a nice sale going on when we were there. I'm going to be in the market for new sofas soon so I'm going to begin following their sales. The eclectic selection made browsing fun for me and I look forward to returning in the future.",

It certainly helped that I was with Boon, Grace, Fernelly and Rachel who are always entertaining..\n\nNate was friendly and helpful and I started off with a few samples. Didn't love the pomegranate (not pomegrantey enough) but the cookies and cream, coffee, yellow cake, and birthday cake were all good. The original tart wasn't the best I've had, maybe on the sweet side? but it was fine. The watermelon is SUPER interesting and fun. \n\nThe toppings are also very playful. lots of sweets like gummies, chocolate covered gummies, licorice strands, sour strips as well as fruit. The price seemed quite reasonable for what I got. The place was pretty busy even late and it's nice that it was open late enough for us to enjoy. Seating was comfortable and the decor is nice. Well lit. People were friendly. \n\nIf they had mochi and the blackberries were a lil better looking I would give it five stars. No WiFi also a lil disappointing. And I like fresh mango and kiwi toppings. Makes me believe I am being healthy.. But otherwise it's definitely a super fun place with a lot of variety, taste and fun.

  "text": "After attending many a movie in Germany at movies with assigned seating I was quite trepidatious. After just a few moments inside the spacious lobby we found the kiosk. I had an insider tip to skip the standard line and head straight to the kiosk. We chose our seats, printed our tickets and headed to the concession line. Concessions were standard price for a theatre visit. The addition of higher quality food and drink options was a nice touch - beer and an italian sausage while enjoying the movie was great!\n\nWe grabbed our snacks and hit the theatre. We were ushered to our seats, the policies of the theatre were explained and we sat down.\n\nThen magic happened - I found the button to adjust the seat into full recliner mode. Instantly I was transported to my own couch just with a much larger screen. \n\nInstantly in love.\n\nI've now been here every few weeks since opening and it is always my first choice for a theatre. I now find myself disappointed when I have to visit other theatres because this one is not offering the movie I want to see.\n\nI'll be curious to see how well maintained this theatre will remain. It's brand new and shiny right now, but where will it be a in a few years. If it stays at a quality this high, I will stay a loyal patron. I shudder to think of returning to a theatre without fully reclining seats. Oh the dread... I need to patronize this, and only this, theatre forever.",

They recently updated some of their food stands (I think that's what they're called) and they are DELICIOUS. I think my fav item is the mashed potato bowl at the Chicken stand - oh my YUM. Bridgestone is massive so it's easy to get lost in but wherever you sit in the venue, you've got a great view. Love the atmosphere when a crowd is packed in there. Unfortunately, parking downtown sucks. I can never find somewhere close to park for less than $15-$20 bucks. Of course there are cheaper spots to park further away from the venue but if I'm meeting friends, and walking alone at night, I prefer to be closer to Bridgestone for safety reasons. \n\nIf you haven't been to an event here, come.

  "text": "The spinners at the counter are wobbly, and there is a photo of the marriage of JKF and Jackie O. on the wall, but Kitty's Luncheonette is as real as it gets for traditional breakfasts and lunches in this part of Philadelphia. They don't know from brunch, and they close before happy hour; so don't bookmark it for your weekend morning meal, nor try to stop in after work.  This is a 7 to 3:30 corner grill that had a few dozen thick scrapple slices frying to a dark brown while I drank their Ellis Coffee and awaited my first taste of their french toast.  \n\nThe house has about a dozen tables in two rooms and eight spinning stools along the counter that overlooks the chef workspace.  It was about half full of neighborhood personalities who seemed to know each other as they were greeted by name.  The server, a lovely young woman who is Kitty's niece, took care of me, and filled me in on the history of the institution, open since 1952! \n\nYes. It looks its age, with family photos on the walls, and original floors, walls and stools.  Either you get the deeply rubbed in culture here, or you don't. With its gritty charm and surprisingly good food, it is easy to develop a crush on Kitty, and want to visit her often. She is as authentic as the day is long.  My three slices of thick egged toast were very good.  A little sweet from the vanilla and sugar in the mix, and a little crispy on the edges where the hot steel melted that sugar and left its hardened residue.  They know how to do FT here. $5.50 was a happy price. The java was strong and a little rough (bitter), but nothing to complain about. Again, her Joe is straight up Bunn-O-Matic.  No expresso options with Kitty. \n\nKitty's is very close to I-95, and an easy on/off if you want to stop before reaching Center City from the north. Not sure she could handle becoming a hit on the breakfast bookmark circuit, especially on weekends, so if you want to check her out, come on a weekday morning when the regular crowd is thinner.  \n\nBut, if you like hard stop traditional breakfast without any frills, give this old girl a go.",

I can get a 'naked' Burrito, called an Ear Muffs - how clever, and get rice, no beans, 1/2 chicken, 1/2 steak, cucumbers, mushrooms, tomatoes, guac, cilantro, and salsa vinaigrette. Hubby gets the Joey burrito with about the same thing.\n\nService: At first the boys who worked here were very short and quick to make our order in the very beginning but now know who we are and know what we order every week!\n\nOverall: We only come here on Mondays, of course, but the food is great at a good price so you can't ask for more than that!",

  "text": "This park is beautiful! I came here while on a 3-hour bus tour of the entire city, so my time here was limited to only 30 minutes. Because of that, I feel like I didn't get enough time to really explore and see every landmark and highlight of City Park. I will say, though that I loved everything that I did get to see while here. I'm a sucker for a few things in a park: Architecture/ruins, unique pavilions, foliage, a place for a snack or beverage to break away from the heat, sculpture/artwork, and water. City Park has all of those things! I'm a sucker for Spanish Moss and Magnolia Trees, neither of which are common in my hometown of St. Louis, so just being able to be near an abundance of those things was a dream come true.\n\nThe sculpture garden here was a treat, and the Morning Call restaurant seems like a lovely place for lunch, ice cream, or a nice beverage.\n\nI loved seeing that this park has many large oak trees with the branches low to the ground. Don't let the 4-star rating fool you, I really enjoyed my time being here, and hopefully on my next visit to NOLA (because I will definitely be back!), I will make plans to spend more time here and take in a lot more of it than 30 minutes. Upon which time, I have no doubt that an extra star will follow.",

  "text": "Unless you're living under a rock, you've heard of The Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant very well known for its encyclopedic menu, but what about the food itself? I can't imagine being the chef/cook in that kitchen, as the responsibility of trying to replicate that many items day in and day out on a consistent basis must be daunting. Well, on a somewhat boring Friday night, I decided to see for myself (once again of course) how well they could do on my particular order. \n     Thinking Friday night, didn't feel like waiting an hour as this particular location is inside of the very popular local mall, so I used the online ordering site. Was easy to use, and let me check out as a guest instead of making me enter my life's story of information, so far so good. I ordered the club sandwich and fries (asked for extra crispy, which they delivered on, A+ on that), and the kids got a hamburger (the Original) with fries, and the Buffalo Wings appetizer (asked for all drumsticks but didn't get, as well as extra crispy fries fo both that also weren't). What I also really liked is that I ordered curbside pickup, and because this was in a mall, they actually have their own parking spots reserved for the restaurant (which is awesome because the mall is always a nightmare for parking), and you just call them and the employee comes right out, ingenious!\n     I have to say, I was quite impressed. All of the food was delicious, kids really loved theirs and my sandwich was on point, really good. But I do have a gripe, and this is starting to become a theme for me lately. Maybe I'm just getting old, or maybe, just maybe, I'm exactly right (I'm thinking the latter of course), but for what I just ordered, what would you expect to pay? $30-$35? $40? How about $47.63 (throw in $5 for the tip), and we're at nearly $53 for what is really glorified diner fare. Does that sound sustainable to you? It must be standard for their business model, and it's obviously working as they've been around for quite a long time, but this isn't a place I can visit consistently without getting a raise at work. And yes, everything else on the menu is priced very aggressively, so buyer be ware. I really want to be a frequent guest of \"The Factory\", but I just can't justify the cost. If your wallet is fat, this is your place, otherwise it's just a once or twice a year \"treat\" for the rest of us (deplorables).",

If you are familiar with Zachary's Pizza in Berkeley/Oakland, CA, then you will love Pi.  I believe Zachary's was inspirational in the creation of the Pi pizza style, hence the Bay Area references on the menu.  Pi definitely provides unique, quality vegetable and meat options for pizza, tasty salads, as well as interesting garlic bread served with actual whole roasted garlic cloves.  Plus, with the domestic draught and bottled microbrewery beer options and fun/hip ambiance, I feel like Pi is a complete win win dining situation.  A must eat/see in St. Louis in my mind.  Also, the establishment is smoke-free and advocates substainability.  Beautiful.",

Money well spent! \n\nWe all pondered how many lights there were total wrapped around tree trunks and branches and lights clinging to wrought iron fences. Has to be in the millions, easily.\n\nThe choreographed lights in front of Lilly House was a delight to watch. However I wished they had mixed up the music a bit, straying from the Nutcracker Suite (which I think they only played 'Waltz of the Flowers' over and over again). I think some more upbeat music every now and again would have added energy to the event.\n\nI like the small details that went into creating this experience. One would be the warming stations that weren't generic gas lamps, but rather real stoves fueled by wood. Very nice touch and right next to the treat stand. Eat and be warm. Good combo.\n\nThe kissing arbor was a big hit! There was a volunteer standing by to assist with photos. How often does someone offer to take your pic!! \n\nMy absolute favorite part was Snowflake Bridge, the first sight you see walking into the display. It was so angelic and lots of dimension. I wanted to stand there forever and look up at the trees. \n\nIF YOUR EYES HURT BY LOOKING AT BLUE LIGHTS, YOU HAVE AN OCULAR DISEASE... WARNING!!\nThere is a section near the big tree made of children's toys that is alllllllll blue lights. I literally couldn't even walk through that area. \n\nI could say about 20 more great things about the evening we spent at Winterlights, but I will leave some for your surprise and delight. Enjoy!",

The booth on my side of the table felt like the cushion was gone in the middle and my chin was on the table.

There were all sorts of different colors and specks on it. I wish I took a picture but I did not.  The remainder of the restaurant looked clean but the booths along the side of the restaurant should be ripped out and replaced. \n\nThe server brought us menus and took our drink orders. We were familiar with the menu since we have been to their other location. I chose the enchiladas lunch special and my wife likes their chimichangas so she ordered that. \n\nOur food arrived in a timely manner and looked yummy and the server was attentive.

The DJ booth sits high and pretty above the dance floor which is small, yet the perfect size.

Maybe I'm just the weird girl that does that, but this dance floor is definitely very inviting.  Also, the back patio is a great size and reminds me of a Mediterranean villa.  There's a lovely fireplace and sometimes they have a DJ spinning out there too. \n\nThe crowd is a bit older compared to some other downtown places and I've seen some fairly eclectic attire (love it).  Go here when you don't feel like dealing with sloppy sorority sisters falling all over the place and screaming, \"WOOOOO!\"  That's not to say I haven't had my share of attitude-filled sass coming from bimbos waiting in the lady's room line.\n\nOh, and no there isn't just one bathroom.

A pair of lovers finding reasons to show far too much PDA a few tables over, a guy going crazy at the air outside, and one really annoying person smoking outside.

It was a nice room, and I thought it was cool to get to see the warehouse.

The food was all refilled as soon as it got low.  The BBQ dishes were all tasty.  But my favorite part of the meal was the berry cobbler.   I love blueberry pie, but I am frequented extremely disappointed if the pie has canned filling.  But I was not at all disappointed with this cobbler.  The filling was fresh, and had a light lemon flavor to it.  Even though I was really full, I still had seconds of the cobbler.

They would pour you some beer after you paid for a tour, as they couldn't sell beer and most certainly did not have a taproom.  \n\nThree weeks ago, Saint Somewhere finally moved to their new location, inside a historic home right in downtown Tarpon Springs.  It's a lovely blue building, with a small front courtyard and a two rooms for enjoying your beer.  Unlike most breweries, and befitting their historic building status, they keep the interior homely and reminiscent of an earlier age, with fading photos (apparently some are of their ancestors.)  Upstairs will be guest rooms, as a new form of B&B - Beer and Bed.  Isn't it how things were hundreds of years ago?  \n\nWhen we visited today, their beers are still fermenting after the move and won't be available for another week or two. They therefore offer several Belgian ales on tap, as well as some of their own brews, plus cider, non-alcoholic tonic water etc. in bottles and cans.  When fully operational, there will be 10 drafts.\n\nIt's great to grab a beer and sit inside by the big window for people watching.  Or sit outside by in their little yard.  Right next door is KC Cue, a great bbq place for grabbing some award winning ribs or pulled pork.  \n\nThey don't do flights, so the beers come in a full pour at around $6-8. They are nice enough to let you sample their beers, in the cutest miniature beer glasses though.",

  "text": "For months I have been craving some Chinese food. I began to research the area and after reading reviews I had to try this place! \n\nI drove out to the location and noticed the area it was in was actually an area I was familiar with! I entered the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the cashier! She was friendly and helpful. My \"go to\" dish at any Chinese restaurant is the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice; and so I didn't have to think about what I wanted to order. What I really enjoyed about this place was that instead of the egg roll as the traditional side, I could choose crab rangoon instead! I LOVE crab rangoon and had actually thought about ordering a side of them; but since they were included in the meal I had to get them. They were to die for! Creamy and delicious! The sweet and sour chicken was phenomenal and just the way I love it! Some places use chicken that I find to be too chewy, but this was tender and juicy! Just thinking about it is making me hungry again. \n\nI will be making another visit and have another dish I plan to try! I will let you know how that goes!",

The exhibits are so fun and interactive, and they're chock full of information that caters to all levels. So bring your kids, come on a date, or take your parents! There's something for everyone. I came here with my bestie, and some of the displays sparked a big discussion for us about the integration of history in science and how it influences the context of what was discovered. As you can see, this place just tickles my brain.\n\nThere is an area that has various exhibits that change from time to time. I visited for the Pixar exhibit, which was super cool, large, and informative, and most recently visited for the Game Master exhibit, a display containing tons of video games, both old and new! 100%, just go. Let me know what you think when you do.",

  "text": "I didn't get to eat here on my last trip so I made it a point to make it this time around. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. You walk through the kitchen into a room full of bright colors. There's a bar upfront and some outdoor seats to the side of the main dining area. It gets absolutely packed and they don't take reservations for parties under 5, so be prepared.\n\nMy favorite dish may have been the fried eggplant appetizer with an oyster cream sauce and mushrooms. I'm a sucker for any cream sauce but this was amazing. Perfectly cooked eggplant smothered in a rich seafood based sauce, amazing. \n\nMy friend ordered the eggplant perogue with shrimp, oysters, and fish in a cream sauce. She loved it but the sauce had some kind of cheese in it and I'm just not a fan of seafood and cheese.\n\nI ordered the Godzilla, a seasonal special of fried softshell crab over fried green tomatoes with remoulade and a side of slaw. I'm not usually a fan of softshell crab (I know, I know) but this was the best I've ever had. The fried green tomatoes were on the soggy side, that may have been due to the remoulade or the crab sitting on top of them, I'm not sure but I left them alone in favor of their amazing slaw! Our entrees came with two sides and a salad. Unknown to us the salad also comes with a fried oyster. Why don't all salads come this way? \n\nService was beyond fantastic, our waiter was extremely patient while we struggled to make our choices. Their Fi Na Ye and watermelon margarita drinks are delicious. Their creme brulee is also a winner. Check them out!",

  "text": "I wanted to love this little bakery by the river in middle of New Hope, but unfortunately the items I tried here were disappointing. On the plus side, service was very friendly - everyone I interacted with was genuinely nice, and they were offering some samples outside the bakery. The location by the river is also lovely, and there is a nice outside seating area. They also accept credit cards now.\n\nI tried the mango mousse and the clafoutis, which were $5.50 each. The mousse was ok, very light and not too sweet, but the sponge beneath was more like a grainy wet cookie. The custard portion of the clafoutis was ok - very eggy and barely sweet - but I didn't like the tough crust underneath or the very bright and artificial cherries. I hope these two are exceptions and that the rest of the large selection is better, but I don't think I'll be stopping by again the next time I'm in the area.",

The last couple of times I've visited Indy my family ends up here as my aunt and uncle love coming here for dinner. It's a good location and has a nice indoor/outdoor setup, but that's about all that impresses me. They have a kiddie area both indoor and outdoor, but keep the kids away from the outdoor stuff especially after rain, it looked a little gross.\n\nEvery time we've been we've had to wait 15-20 minutes for someone to come by our table and greet us/take drink orders. It's not like they've been uber busy and had a line out the door. I can't even recall there being a hostess at the front to direct us where to sit. The most recent time, we had one girl finally come up to our table and take our drink orders, but then disappear for another 10-15 minutes before another lady came to our aid. Waitress #2 was the one who took our food order and drink refills. And then more waiting until our food slowly trickled to the table - just a few salads and some of the [nothing special IMO] fish n chips. The chips are good, but the fish is... meh. The girls were really good at drink refills once we got our food, weirdly enough. And then right when we're looking to get the check, they disappear again, and more waiting had to be done to get the bill. And more waiting to get the receipts/cards back. \n\nTLDR: Service needs improvement. The food is nothing special. Thank God they serve alcohol.",

Sorry for not knowing the names well but thats what the pictures are for right?\n\nThe pineapple and ham entree was legit, really good! The salads and marinated veggies were on point. I highly suggest trying the soup with bok choy and chicken! Super good! The one with bacon and okra was also really tasty. The tandori chicken they had was also fall off the bone good! They had a really good black bean and potato entree with a nice kick to it I enjoyed.\n\nI need to take my 3 apartment friends who actually moved from Brazil to work at Wash U and Barnes on fellowships into this place to see how they rate the food on the buffet and the main menu. I love Brazilian food myself as they use spices, marinates and herbs so well to amplify the flavors of almost everything!",

It was honestly the best Indian food I have ever had. And this was like over five years ago. The only problem, Indian is not supposed to be expensive!!! I mean, the places by Penn are so much more reasonable, although they lack the luxurious ambience. \nBut anyway, Cafe Spice Express is like the best of both worlds. I can get my delicious, most favorite foods in the entire world, Vegetable Samosas, and a side of garlic Naan (mm fresh from the oven and filled with flavorful bits of garlic...) for a reasonable price.\n I haven't ever had any of the entrees from here, but I am sure they are just as tasty. My favorite part of the Express is the location. After a day of roaming around or shopping with friends we can go to the food court at Liberty and all find something we like to eat. I will always, of course, choose Cafe Spice.\n\nOH! Totally forgot-- Now Whole Foods carries Cafe Spice samosas to go! And I got some today and they were pretty tasty. Not as good as fresh from the restaurant but definitely an upgrade from the ones they were carrying before.",

  "text": "This is one of those times where I'm like, \"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place\", but honestly, I loved it so much that I'd write it over and over again if needed. I mean, who doesn't love ranch dressing? And, well, if you don't think is not the place for you.\n\nI found myself in St. Louis and had been looking all over for random places to try. A friend of mine came up with this suggestion at the advice of a friend. I said, \"how could this be bad with ranch in the title?\" \n\nThe biggest issue with dining here really was finding street parking. Well, also, the place is packed, but you can make it work like we did by sitting at the bar. Believe me, they can fit a lot of plates on that bar because we went to town on some food.\n\nAlso, I'd like to add- if you don't like French fries you're going to 1) be missing out 2) I guess order onion rings because how do you not get French fries with ranch dressing?\n\nOkay, so the main attraction in my opinion, and I have to be in the majority here is the ranch this country flight. For $13 you get a mountain of fries and 13, yes 13 different type of ranch of your choosing. They have like 30 total so believe me, it's difficult. Not a glutton like us? Well you can do the ranch this country flight for $5 which has your choice of 5 ranch flavors.\n\nSome of the flavors include: Twisted Ranch (original), Asian Zing, Avocado, Carter's Smoke (Smoke Paprika), Buttermilk Basil, Greek, Jack the Ripper (Pepper Jack), It Takes 2 to \"Mango\", Pesto, Red Billy Goat (Red Peppers & Goat Cheese), Roasted Garlic, Southwest, Ruffalo (Roasted Garlic & Buffalo), and Smoke Tomato Basil just to list off some of the choices.  The flight comes on essentially a lazy Susan that spins around delightful ranch dressing. The amount of fries is almost absurd. But the fries and every ranch dressing were delicious.\n\nBeing me, I got even more fries with my patty melt style burger which was cooked exactly how I wanted it to be, but again, you almost don't come here to eat anything other than ranch, but please do because the food was quality even if it is under the shadow of that ranch dressing which we were told was made in house.\n\nThe service was great. The staff behind the bar were super friendly and chatted with us a lot while we ate. It was a great experience. Something I didn't know I needed in my life and a place I have to get back to. It's one of those places you'd travel there just to go to, well, at least if you love ranch dressing as much as I do. And the prices are so unbelievably cheap too. It's definitely a win.",

Beautiful presentation. \n\nOur birthday boy loved his cake and my co-workers who had never experienced, The Cakery were totally impressed. They loved the rich flavor and how moist the cake was.

They always have an array of pies, all with different toppings, for you to grab slices from - and plenty of vegetarian (and even a vegan option or two), as well!\n\nThe menu has so much more than pizza, such as burgers, salads, strombolis/calzones, and more.  I've only eaten a few slices, but they can custom-make any type of pizza you're looking for and the other items on the menu sound great too.  Given their initial cafe, I know the quality of the ingredients are going to be top-notch and the food will taste great.\n\nWill be back a lot!  And they're BYOB!",

  "text": "Until today, I don' think I really knew what mediocre sushi tasted like. I went with a friend for a late lunch, about 2 pm but still within their lunch special window (11-3). For $10 I got two classic rolls and a salad. The rolls were about on par with grocery store sushi. My friend got one of the stirfrys and a roll and felt similarly lukewarm.\n\nOur server was very attentive and friendly, and both the interior and patio were lovely. I would give both of these elements 4 stars, but with just meh sushi, I can't bring myself to muster an overall three stars. If I go back, I'll probably choose fried over \"fresh.\"",

  "text": "I am a Sephora fan.  I LOVE Sephora as a store/brand.  I just do not like this particular Sephora location.  They have poor customer service.  One thing that attracted me to the Sephora stores years ago when I started using Sephora was the customer service.  Someone was always eager to help and excited to show me new products.  It was a great business tactic on their part because I may have gone in for mascara but I'd end up leaving with 4 things!  And I loved it because I love makeup!  \n\nSince I moved to St. Louis and began coming to this Sephora location, I just haven't had that same positive experience.  They still have the product I want, so I shop here regularly, but their employees (and therefore, probably management) stinks!  Instead of being welcomed into the store, their employees can be found chatting amongst themselves.  I have to interrupt them when I have a question.  They are not usually eager to help me try on new products and find things that fit me.  \n\nDuring my most recent experience the employee had no knowledge of the products I was asking about and barely helped me at all.  Each of the samples was worn down or dried out and I kept mentioning to this employee that this was the case.  She just offered a \"yeah\" but didn't do anything to get a fresh product sample.  \n\nWhen I went to check out they were out of the 500 point rewards and had nothing to replace them.  \n\nHonestly, what used to be my favorite store is now losing its appeal to me.  I feel like going to department stores instead of Sephora for my makeup.",

  "text": "Philadelphia has many of these cozy speakeasy concept bars popping up, some deserve the hype and others that fall painfully short. I also, as a Philadelphian, resent loving a Stephen Starr restaurant as much as I love Ranstead Room.\n\nWhomever designed this concept for Starr left no detail to chance. It's warm, intimate, sexy and romantic. Soft portraits of beautiful women from yesteryear bring what I imagine to be the feel of an old gentlemen's lounge. The black damask wall paper leaves a dramatic impression in the small room and pulls together the elegant vintage aesthetic. Dim lighting and flickering candles tie together the room, perfect for sharing drinks and secrets with your companions.\n\nOf course we don't go to these bars to get seduced by the decor, let's get down to cocktails. Vodka is a dirty word, if you want it go elsewhere. The mixologists working the bar here have the talent to turn the toughest spirits into tongue pleasing treats. If you don't know what you want or see it on the menu do yourself a favor and trust the talent here. Tell them the notes and flavors you enjoy most and they will deliver something you may have never even believed you would like. Be open minded and most of all be patient. True art takes time.\n\nThe service here is unmatched. I have enjoyed return trips to sit at the bar and watch Tang open up his little handwritten black book of drinks, dreaming of the treasures within. Alicia is a sweet gem whose personality makes it impossible to not to feel like you are welcome to stay the night and chit chat over drinks. Do yourself a favor and bring a date or your paying parents here. The staff will make you comfortable and make sure you're well attended while providing the best classic cocktail selection in the city.",

  "text": "My heart says 5; my logic tells me 4.\n\nWhy 5?:\nThis is my absolute FAVORITE place to get breakfast on the weekends!  It is so reasonably priced and the food is outstanding!  My routine meal has grown to consist of a cup of coffee and the \"Sunrise\", which is a half order of biscuits & gravy, 2 eggs (any style) & 2 bacon strips or sausage links.  I just love it...not to mention it's easy on the bank; my entire meal typically stays right around $10, including a tip. \nThere is absolutely something for everyone on the menu; they serve lunch and breakfast, and you really can't go wrong with either!\n\nSo, why a 4?:\nFlap Jacks Pancake House is only open until 3pm.  This sounds okay at first, but I feel that they are busy enough to entertain crowds a little longer, especially on the weekends.  Furthermore, there have been multiple times when I wanted Flap Jacks on a Sunday afternoon, but it was too close to closing time for that to be a realistic option. \nAnother reason for my 4 rating is because there are times when the service is sort of slow.  They absolutely do their best to provide great service, but they are always so busy!  I whole-heartedly believe that the slow service is due to how overwhelmingly busy they can be at times. \nLastly, the place can feel a little crowded when there are a lot of people dining.  The tables are situated rather close to each other, and there is very limited standing space when waiting to be seated.\n\nAs a whole, I would recommend Flap Jacks to anyone!  In fact, it is typically my \"go-to\" recommendation when people ask about places to eat breakfast/brunch in the area.  It's really a \"must try\"!",

I've eaten at their Mt Rose store when I've been in the area but have asked them time and time again to branch out closer to my side of Reno.  My favorite bagel is the rock salt bagel which should be eaten fresh as the next day it becomes a bit wet.  I guess it picks up some of the humidity in the air.  Chemistry anyone?  Still, I'll eat it.  They also serve sandwiches and drinks along with smears but the two times I've been there I've only picked up bagels by the dozen and pleasantly, they serve a baker's dozen!  They took over the old Starbucks building at the base of California Avenue and Virginia Street.  The only suggestion I have for them would be that I'd love to see egg bagels.  I haven't seen them anywhere since I left Hawaii so there must be something difficult about making them.  Please make them.  I will buy them... Regularly!  The bagels are priced at less than a dollar each.  Well worth it.",

I have been 3 times since finding it, and can't wait to go back. It came highly recommended by one of the Mexican employees with whom I work, and I would make the same recommendation! The service is excellent, the food is absolutely delicious, and the ambience is very nice. I can't think of anything that I don't really like about El Maguey. It is located in a relatively un-amazing strip mall on 38th street (though, how many places in Indianapolis aren't located in a crappy strip mall?) next to the Little Caesars and hiding behind the Steak and Shake. You'd never know that inside of the unassuming Mexican restaurant front is some seriously great food and great service.\n\nA huge part of my Mexican restaurant experience is the chips and salsa served before the meal. Call me whatever you want, I love that stuff! The chips and salsa at El Maguey are the best I've had in town. I also keep ordering the huevos rancheros ($5 for the lunch plate... but it's enough food to feed 2!!) and it always makes me smile. You've gotta try this place!",

I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised! \n\nThis little shop is reminiscent of a taco truck, with a permanent location. As with many local taco trucks, it serves up excellent tacos with high quality meat and flavors. I was very happy with the lunch special of two carne asada tacos and a quesadilla. The salsa options were great, as I love pouring on a few different kinds. I have to say that the tacos surpassed the quesadilla in taste, as the meat was fabulous but the tortillas may have been cooked a bit too long.\n\nMy one grievance may be that the menu is a bit limited, their tacos and quesadillas are great but that's all there is. They are definitely more of a lunch place, and probably not great for a group who may want something other than just tacos and quesadillas. Even so, I'll probably stop in again one day soon.",

We had a few other cake tastings before this and while the cake was delicious, I couldn't handle the frosting. Dawn was so sweet and helpful. Our first visit we got to try a good amount of flavors of cake and filling. Dawn gave suggestions of different cake flavors and fillings that go well together. We left feeling great about Shake Sugary. A few weeks later...we forgot what exact flavors fiance and I had liked best. So, Dawn let us come back in to try our top two again (berry chantilly and strawberry cake with passion fruit filling). She even put these into cupcake form with filling and all...which made us MORE excited and happy with our decision! Our guest count was also larger than we thought, so Dawn gave us a cost efficient idea to add two dozen cupcakes to our two tier cake instead of adding another layer (which was more pricey). This helped out a lot! \n\nThey worked with our planners on getting the cake to the venue, have cake stands if you need, and ideas on decorating cakes with fresh flowers. I wanted a semi-naked cake with fresh flowers and it came out exactly like the photos. Loved it. Working with them was easy. Emails and online or in person payments. \n\nI also got to try their biscuits and gravy once for brunch during another visit. I got the maple bacon biscuit. AMAZING.

  "text": "Great restaurant in the CBD! While I have only been for happy hour, I keep coming back for the delicious pizzas and drinks (both half price from 2-5 for happy hour EVERYDAY), the cauliflower with whipped feta, and the upscale atmosphere. I love going during happy hour because you get the feel of being at a fancy restaurant without paying fancy restaurant prices. \n\nThe pizzas are thin crust and delicious! My absolute favorite is the clam pizza and everyone I introduce it to loves it as well. This past weekend I also shared the margherita pizza and the zucca pizza with a group and I liked them both but wasn't as obsessed with them.. The clam pizza was the clear winner! The cauliflower is also amazing! The whipped feta it comes with really makes it incredible but it is definitely pricey at $20 for the dish. The salads I've had from Domenica have also been very yummy! The best part is that you leave the restaurant full (and usually with leftovers) and for much less than you would pay at other restaurants! Also, the little cookies they give you with the check (I refer to them as ugly cookies) are a delicious treat to end the meal! My only real problem with Domenica is that it can get really loud, which makes it difficult to hear the people you're eating with. \n\nFood -- 5 stars\nPrice -- 5 stars (for happy hour)\nService -- 4 stars\nAtmosphere -- 4.5 stars",

  "text": "I've been here twice and I really like this place. It's like an upscale sports bar and you have to take it for what it is. The decor is nice and they have TVs all over the place. I haven't had too much of their food but I've tried their seared tuna and tacos and they were both pretty good. They do have the TN fries and those are lovely and you must try them. They come with jalapeno ketchup. Good place to go when you want to catch a game and don't feel like going to a dive. Oh yeah, and the people that were there on both nights were beautiful. So good eye candy.",

  "text": "I've been shying away from this place for a while now because of all the mixed reviews. However, whenever I do get a hankering for some take out close to my work place for lunch, there are only fast food restaurants around, which I actively avoid (when I can). A co-worker changed my mind about going to Phat Bites - claiming they have the best hummus. Being a pescatarian/vegetarian, I do love my hummus (especially trying out different, homemade ones). So, since the first visit, I've been here at least three times - and all three times, I loved it. I tried their Tuna wrap, their caprese sandwich, and their selection of hummus - my most recent ones being chipotle and pumpkin (not together - separate hummus). The chipotle was delicious and the pumpkin was surprisingly yummy. It shouldn't work - but it does. It doesn't even taste like hummus - it tastes like pumpkin pie filling. They give you sugared pita chips to go with it - it's like having dessert in the form of protein for lunch. I'm hungry just thinking about it. The tuna was good - but it wasn't AMAZING. I loved the caprese sandwich though - that added balsamic touch puts it over the top.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty funky. It's a converted garage with graffiti and creative canvasses of art displayed everywhere. There is a small stage for live music (which, I'm assuming, happens at night because I never see anyone perform). Best of all, they play underground, \"indie\" music. Just yesterday, I heard them playing a song from Under the Influence of Giants - a band that dissolved but still remains a favorite of mine to this day.\n\nService is always served with a smile. There has been a couple of times where they forget to bring you something that you ordered but as long as you remind them, there shouldn't be any issues.",

  "text": "Royal India is home to the tastiest Indian food in Reno! To me, it feels like I am walking into someone's kitchen when I arrive. The staff are so friendly and welcoming and the service is awesome. As soon as we sit down someone is there to greet us. I love that! \n\nI typically will go with one or two others for their lunch buffet. What I love about the lunch buffet is that they are always switching out the dishes, but they also always have the same top picks for returning customers. They have the thali trays so you can try many different types of curries and sauces. The food at the buffet has been fresh and hot every time I have come in, and I have arrived at varying times of the day. \n\nMy favorite dish they have at the buffet is the Chicken tiki masala. It is so flavorful, creamy, and the chicken is moist. The naan is served fresh and the chai tea is a perfect cap for a delicious meal. \n\nThank you, Royal India! You have filled many Sunday afternoons with great memories for my family and I!",

  "text": "I've always been a fan of Steak 'n Shake and was glad to see Reno had a location.  I was quickly greeted, seated and brought a glass of water while I perused the menu.  I ordered the Bacon Double Cheese Burger with fries and a mocha shake. The food made it to the table in under 10 minutes and the server checked up on me about 3 times.  Their burgers are classic east coast diner style burgers, meaning they are very thin (as they should be for this style).  So to the customer this means a double is more like a single at other fast food restaurants like Wendy's or Burger King.  If you want a more traditional \"double\" you need to order a 3 patty burger.  I already knew this, but I see several reviews talking about how thin the patty's were.  Overall good location and still love seeing the 50's retro style decor' and my meal came out to be around $13 with tip.  They do not offer a military discount, but I was glad to see that they removed the \"No guns allowed\" sign to allow concealed carry customers to exercise their rights again at this location.",

I got a double cheeseburger with onions with a medium fry. Hope you like fries, they give you a ton of them. Just my order of fries would have been enough for my wife and i with leftovers. I know the new thing is to make fresh homemade fries, but to me they usually taste slightly burnt or over cooked. The burger was really good, i loved it. Lots of flavor and very juicy. I got a milkshake to go, it was really good, very thick and taste great. The tea was weird, not sure if it was brewed or like that nestea crap. All the workers were nice and quick, they cleared our table as soon as we finished.",

  "text": "So much to love about Brasserie Saint James. The building has great seating options, both inside and outside, and I love the hanging \"carnival\" lights. The menu is varied and all five people in my party found several things they wanted to try. I had the Blue Lemon Jefferson cocktail (so good!) and we all split the poutine appetizer and the crab and artichoke skillet. My entree was the arugula and gruyere flat bread. Everything we ate tasted fresh and yummy!  I really appreciate the eco-friendly straws. Save the turtles!\nI will say I was disappointed that we were not able to enjoy their rooftop seating. We asked but were told they didn't have enough servers to support that area. A little surprising for lunch on a Saturday but sometimes things like that just happen. If I could change some things about this experience Brasserie Saint James, it would be to let your customer enjoy their appetizers for a few minutes before bringing out the entree, and fill the water glasses to the same level. Petty? Maybe. But five already-filled glasses were brought to us each had varying levels of water in them. One was overflowing, one looked 1/2 full, one had no ice, one was almost all ice, and, well, you get the picture. \nWill you also publish your menu on your website?  Is it there and just really well hidden? Pictures of food draw the eye but it's odd to not find the menu. Knowing the owner's and investing partners biographies is thrilling, but what can we eat?!?",

  "text": "Last time I was in the Pure Fare restaurant, I mentioned to the cashier that I wished the place was closer to my office in University City. She let me know that they were opening a food truck, hopefully in September. I got the news last week, from the U City facebook feed, that they were indeed opening on Wednesday. \n\nI made it out here on Friday at 12 just before a bit of a rush of people. They serve the same salads and sandwiches, pre-made and ready to go. I liked that the salad dressing was on the side, because I was picking up two salads to share for dinner later that night.\n\nThe salad with zucchini \"noodles\", edamame, bell peppers and grape tomatoes was delightful. I think it was the salad dressing, a fresh tasting light lemony dressing, was what made it really special. The second salad was a bed of arugula with fresh beets, goat cheese and red onions. I had buyer's remorse at first when I brought that one home, because I usually can't hang with the peppery arugula. I was surprised that I loved this salad as well. Again, the dressing was what made the arugula bearable. The goat cheese was a little bland, but perhaps it is a lower fat version than what I'm used to.\n\nI'd love to give them five stars, but I think they're still working out some food truck basics. If you're going to sell from a food truck, please charge an amount that is divisible by a quarter. My total bill came to $15.12 and I had to dig for change at the bottom of my purse! \n\nI will be back. Probably twice a week because it's a 5 minute walk away, hooray!",

I've been three times and the service and quality of food and beverage has been excellent every time! Their Oyster Bed Roast is easily my favorite oyster dish I've ever had. In addition, both the Bombay Shrimp and Tamarind Shrimp are delicious! The Bombay Shrimp come with a great dipping sauce on the side and the Tamarind Shrimp have a lot of onions (delicious for onion lovers) and are incredibly good. We also never skip the Truffle Naan! For those of you who may not love truffle, never fear! They have garlic and plain as well! From the main plates I've had the Khyber Lamb Chops, the Lotus Root Kofta and the Chicken Biriyani. There is no bad choice but my favorite would have to go to the Chicken Biriyani, served in a small cast iron pot...delicious!!

I kid you not, so frickin' good.\nI ordered the hogfish sandwich and I was extremely disappointed. It was really dry.

I wouldn't make a priority to come back... then again, that pineapple bread and coconut butter may make me do it.",

I've tried the high-end salons in Clayton, Creve Coeur, Town and Country and Frontenac. Celeslie's can rival any of them.\n\nI've had several stylists color and/or cut my hair over the years, but Jamie is my favorite! She really listens to me, never pushes anything on me and seems to intuitively know when to encourage me to try something new and when to leave me be in my comfort zone. I've come to trust her without question and for me, that's priceless. Additionally, I really like Jen for dying my eye lashes, facials and microderms. I also had my first massage here! For me, this was a BIG deal. I was never comfortable with the idea of a massage, but I finally gave in and now I'm hooked! So much so, that for our first wedding anniversary, I booked a Couples' Massage for my husband and me. It was awesome! We arrived, were taken to the spa area, had some wine, changed in to lovely, soft robes and sat in the dry sauna for a bit. Then we headed to a quiet, dimly lit room with soft music for an hour of heaven. My husband even fell asleep during his! Afterward, we had private time in the rain forest shower. It was a wonderful afternoon and we will definitely do it again.\n\nLastly, I want to comment on Jamie's skill and knowledge. I have a medical condition that has caused my hair to thin and for the texture to change. She has guided me through the maze of products to find the perfect Aveda ones for me. My hair is regrowing and has regained its soft feel and is stronger and healthier than it's been in years. The transformation is hard to believe! She also gave me a lot of guidance on how to communicate what I wanted with the stylists at the resort where we were married. I was worried they would overdo my make-up and hair and she walked me through what I wanted and instructed me on how to communicate it with them. It worked our perfectly! The next best thing to having Jamie do it herself.\n\nI'm a total fan of Jamie's and Celeslie's. I will continue to go there for all of my salon needs.",

  "text": "I'll say this first: I never crave Italian food. Call me crazy but it's the cheap as dirt Mexican food that holds a special place in my heart. But alas, my beau is Italian... so, uh... when in Rome?\n\nI digress.\n\nAs a nice gesture to my boyfriend, I caught the special on Sharing Spree - $15 for $30 at Vito's and surprised him with 5:30pm reservations on a Saturday night. From the outside, it looks like a casual pizza joint. We walked through their patio area thinking we'd split a pie and toss back a few beers.\n\nNot the case! They have pizzas, yes... but they have much, much more.\n\nAfter finding out that they were out of vermouth (no manhattans for us) and several of their wine selections, I had the waitress go down the list to tell me what they did have. We settled on a bottle of cabernet and ordered caprese (so good!) to start.\n\nFor entrees: Chicken Florentine with risotto for me and Gulf Prawns Fra Diavolo for him. I probably wouldn't order the florentine again; WAY too much cream sauce for my taste, but the prawns? Out of control good. A little spicy with vegetables in a tomato sauce... LEGIT. \n\n\nThe verdict? Tutto bene! Mi amore gave it a stamp of approval by saying he'd love to return and bring his family. So, if you go on anyone's word here, go on his.",

  "text": "My husband and I have been here twice so far and both visits have been good. The first time was the best visit. The first time I got the spinach fettucine alfredo and so far that is our favorite. When we went the first time the service was perfect and our waiter even boxed up our food for us before we even asked for a box. Like everyone has said the bread is very good. I got the minestrone soup which I thought was good but not the best I have ever had. My husband got the caesar which we didn't love because it has the thinner dressing, not the nice creamy caesar dressing we like. \n\nThe second time we went was a little later in the evening. When we got there it wasn't too busy but by the time we left people were waiting for tables. Understandably the service was slower this time. We split the appetizer sampler and the sampler with the chicken parmesan.  The food was pretty good but not as good as the fettucine alfredo. We did really like the stuffed ravioli, I loved that it was stuffed with cheese. We really wanted to try the bananas foster but unfortunately they were out, so we'll have to try it some other time. \n\nOverall I really like this place. I definitely want to try the crab ravioli next time.",

  "text": "My friends and I were looking for a spot to get po'boys that wasn't too far from our hotel. NOLA Poboys' location on Bourbon Street is what initially caught our eye.\n\nWhen we walked in, it was pretty busy but the line moved quickly. If you have at least one other person with you, I suggest grabbing a seat first. The main entrance has booth seating and stools near the door. There is more seating in the back but that was reserved for tours that come by. The man at the register was very friendly and patient as my friends and I figured out what we wanted to order. \n\nBetween the three of us, we had the fried oyster, fried crawfish and fried catfish po'boys. We also split an order of the fried okra. All three were had perfectly crispy, fried seafood with a great spice. I'm not great with spicy food but I didn't find the heat on the fried seafood to be overwhelming. My friend ordered her po'boy Yankee-style, just to be safe. I didn't love the fried okra. It definitely could've used a dipping suace.\n\nWhat NOLA Poboys lacks in frills, it more than makes up for in traditional po'boys. This meal hit the spot and is a great place to grab a po'boy if you're on Bourbon Street.",

No idea what happened.\n  Concept seems great - Upscale farm to table style traditional Mexican Food with extensive tequila list.\n  Food was good, but not blow your mind away food as I was expecting or for what the prices are! But also keep in mind that I am not a gourmet or connnoisseur of Mexican cuisine.  \n  We all liked the Chips and 3 dips that came with it!  \n  One diner in our party loved the seared salmon mole - thought it was excellent!  Another got the Shrimp & Avocado Salad and didn't like the pickled vegetables at all (felt it overpowered the salad).  Two of us got the Carne Asada Tacos.  They were okay, but at $16 for just 2 tacos, man that was way overpriced and honestly seemed crazy when I can go to Surf Shack & get their Filet Mignon Tacos for half that price.\n  Perhaps they are having opening issues still, perhaps the Chef Todd being gone is an issue - but for what we paid for 4 people to eat was way way more than it was worth in my opinion.",

Instead of tasting like tiny air pillows they were dense - I am hopeful it was just an off night.  The other dish we had was the cannelloni - if you love cheese and sauce this is your dish.  The bread was a foccacia style and simply ok, they could have warmed it in the oven at least.  \n\nThey have a varied wine list and a good selection of beers, no liquor.  \n\nBecause I've always enjoyed it in the past I will go again and fingers crossed they are back on track that night.",

Pretty awesome. \n\nBut, then, one fateful day, I tried to go to NM. The story goes like this: I finally convinced a friend (the lovely Jill F.) to try it with me, and as we're standing, within the columns of their porch, reading their menu, a pigeon hits us! This pigeon must have eaten the worst food (and I assume some cruel kids had fed it laxatives). In one go, it hit my head and arm and my friend's arm! It was the mother-load of pigeon poo!  So we used their bathrooms to rinse of the green gooeyness and went home.\n\nA month or two later, I hosted an Unofficial Yelp Event here (with the lovely George R.). We came without warning the establishment because we had no idea how many people to expect. The servers and managers were extremely helpful and friendly. The manager even came over and talked to me about Yelp and also told me that they put up pigeon guards since I was last there.   Then, the management gave all of the people in our party a shot on the house. Pretty awesome. \n\nHaving been back several times now, I can say with confidence that the servers and bartenders are great, here. \n\nThe food is tasty and really reasonably priced.\n\nI just wish they were open for lunch on the weekends. \n\nAnd one more time for luck: Pretty awesome. \n\nSnag a seat.

  "text": "I've been to Nodding Head twice now, once taking a business partner for a couple brews and a debrief after a massacre of a client meeting, and then last night for late night drunk food with fellow Yelper Michelle C. and her sister after the event at Helium, where I had like 6 Bud Lights.  Nodding Head is pretty well-known as a local microbrewery staple, lauded by self-described true brew heads as a destination for heavy and unique tasting oat soda.\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS:\nI've been there when I was in the only table in the place, and I've been there when there's a full crowd at night, but both were on weekdays, so I can't speak to Nodding Head as a weekend spot.  It's gives just the kind of first impression you'd expect from a microbrewery, if not a little more earthly than most.  The clientelle and staff appear to be the kind of people who know their beer and come to Nodding Head for a reason, and that you wouldn't catch many of them dead in a chic martini lounge or wine & cheese bar...regardless, the mood feels jovial and welcoming.  Nodding Head can be a little inconspicuous if it's your first (or in my case, second) time, as it's accessed via a single door leading upstairs.  There is usually a sign there, but I completely missed it.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE/SERVICE:\nDark, very dark and warm, with all-wood furnishings, floors, etc., accented by the tall stainless steel brewing equipment.  The bathrooms are located in the center where the main brewery is implanted right in the center of the rear seating area, giving you the feeling that you really are drinking their beer in the middle of their brewery (a la Sam Adams commercials).  As I said, the clientelle appear to be pretty friendly, our waiter was able to accommodate us as relative brew newbs, so we all felt pretty comfortable.  I've been to other breweries where the staff was condescending and didn't do much to help us decide what to try, but in the case of Nodding Head, I feel they were just the opposite in both visits.\n\nTHE DRINKS/FOOD:\nAs mentioned earlier, most of Nodding Head's brews are pretty heavy, Grog and Monkey Knife Fight being the lightest, and Oatmeal Stout being on the heavier side.  Additionally, the menu gave no indication of their carrying other brews, which leads me to believe that they don't; even though I remember seeing a bar, I couldn't see if it was stocked with anything.  I got the Grog the first time, which was pretty good, a little heavy for my tastes, and the Monkey Knife Fight the second time.  Monkey Knife Fight is a bit clearer in my memory-- it is relatively light, with a heavy ginger flavor...definitely NOT the choice to compliment spicy foods, which is mostly what we had ordered, but it was still tasteful and enjoyable to me before we got our food.  The food was very good, although we only had appetizers-- the Pita w/ spicy hummus, a sampler platter, and their pub fries.  While the hummus didn't taste very home made, it wasn't bad, and the sampler and the fries were excellent-- I loved the texture and taste of the fries, with that spicy mayonnaise concoction they have for dipping (which I got to keep all to myself).  It was a little on the pricey side for some of the food, but I guess it was worth it.  Portions were very generous, and we all left feeling satiated.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\nA cozy little microbrewery that is as tried-and-true to beer vets as it is accessible to brew newbies, they have good food and good heavy beer (if heavy beer is your thing), don't go there expecting to taste something you could try somewhere else, the flavors are unique and should be enjoyed and judged according to your palette and not your past experiences at other breweries.  Worth checking out for sure if you're curious!",

I had the ribeye with steamed veggies and a salad. The ribeye was just a tad fatty but had a great flavor. The burgers looked good (one was carried to the table behind us). If you want to get some steps in after dinner, the location just outside is fantastic to window shop. Also, very close to the Katy Trail for the bikers out there. Would definitely go again!",

  "text": "On my recent trip to Philly, I loved Frieda so much I came here three times. That is something I never do ever, as I usually try to experience as many spots in a city as humanly possible while traveling. But I was so smitten with Frieda that I genuinely looked forward to returning.\n\nMISSION: Frieda is an intergenerational restaurant, community center, art gallery, bakery, and coffee shop. Its primary identity may be a restaurant, but they often flip the space for workshops, readings, and other cool classes. They sell amazing local goods by local makers, and I love their statement about their artists, bakers and employees: \"And while you're here, know that any money you spend at FRIEDA helps us create fair-wage jobs for people of all generations - many of them retired, but still needing to work to make ends meet - as well as support our Outreach Community Program.\"\n\nFOOD + DRINK: Reasonably priced and crave-worthy. The salmon avocado toast was beautifully presented, had delicious flavor and was very generous. As for bakery, my Mom and I both agreed their croissant was the best we've ever had. Thick but still flaky and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate. The London Fog and other coffee drinks we had were always well-made and satisfying.\n\nSERVICE + VIBE: Nahir is amazing. I actually hugged him on my final visit! We had so many great chats about Frieda's programs, the menu, and just Philly in general. He went above and beyond. The vibe here is very white and minimal, but open and airy. You get a great feeling just sitting there and existing.\n\nI wish this spot was in Cleveland because I'm obsessed with its multi-faceted approach to community and its inclusiveness. I can't recommend it enough! It is such a pleasant surprise that you can feel good about supporting.",

You can select ALL of the toppings you want at no additional cost. I think I might overdue it a bit, but I love veggies .:shrugs:.\n\nThey offer two size options - a 6 inch and an 11 inch. I get the 11 inch and eat the entire thing between lunch and dinner, and it's only about $9. Worth every penny.",

  "text": "Loved Salvos!!! This place has a bomb seafood boil, it's spicy just the way we like it ! I didn't know, I could eat this much until this place. It's very very casual, not fancy at all, so it makes you feel more at home and comfortable to stuff your face !\n\nThey bring out hot, steamy Blue crabs, Shrimps, Crab legs , Jonah Crab Claws, Crawfish, Sausages, Potatoes and Corn!!! \n\nThe service can be a little slow at times because of how crazy busy they are. They do Table orders, not the get it yourself style. \n\nWe had the Friday Buffet which is the best one! It has everything, they offer buffet during the week but it's always different and changes , there is tons of items on the menu to try for fried foods as well, but we were too busy taking advantage of the AYCE!!! \n\nI would totally recommend this place to anyone visiting. It isn't exactly downtown but well worth the drive for 10-15 minutes for this hole in the wall. \n\nBe careful when you drive in though , instead of rocks or pavement on their parking lot, they put rocks and Oyster shells ! Haha",

  "text": "Hugo's slogan is \"We build sandwiches\" well based on my recent visit they did not pass code with me!  I had such high hopes for this place as a 4 star rated deli and a ton of Elite yelper's giving it 5 stars. I have to fail them because or FOOD SAFETY 101 come on!! \n\n**Cleanliness- FAIL \n  Being in the food industry alooong time I go straight for looking at cleanliness of where I'm going to eat.  I notice the place is fairly dirty, floors, tables, and then I check the bathrooms.  As pictured the sink was gross and I dared not take a pic of the toilet, how is this possible though? They just had opened ... I was one of the first people in which must mean people are not trained in cleaning or just neglected it.  \n\n**Food/Service 1 Star \n  I was helped quickly and navigated through the maze of confusing menu boards and price signs.  I opted for the French dip with no onion, it was made fairly quickly and served warm w Au jus. The sandwich it self was nothing special and the aujus had a tangy pickly taste that overpowered it.  My guess is too much peppercinni juice or left them in to long when cooking the sauce.   My service was good but I noticed many of the girls just standing and talking to each other and laughing, even with 6 girls when it came to lunch rush they seem to not be very efficient.  They share a 3 foot sandwich board and customers had to just stand while room was made for their sandwich to begin \"construction\".  \n  \n** FOOD SAFETY FAILS\n   I did witness many hand washings and changing of gloves as required, sadly that all is voided by the fan blowing near the slicer and sandwich table.  (As pictured) \n\n   What was worse is the bacon tub filled with bacon sitting out, keep in mind I was there for an hour or more.  No way was that bacon temping hot or cold enough to fight bacteria, that is just gross and will get someone sick.  I ran into the same thing with a cream cheese tub that sat out at room temp the whole time.",
