  "text": "We went there yesterday afternoon and naturally it was a rather unique experience.  There's lots of interesting material posted on the walls at frequent intervals and there are self-guided audio tours (there are also guided tours at 2:00 p.m., but we were there later).  Irrespective of the reasons for the inmates having been imprisoned, there were two rather poignant things:  a tiny synagogue (one of the very few prison synagogues) which was built & maintained by volunteers in Philadelphia, and a framed prison newsletter article beautifully written by an inmate about the long-time prison doctor (who was originally there for many years on a voluntary basis).",

  "text": "This store is definitely a store for high schoolers who need books off their book list for the semester. (They also have a used book section that is quite limited - more mystery and romance books than straight up lit.) The books are organized just like the bookstore I used to grab books at when I was a high school student. I still would have bought a book anyway (some books that high school students are assigned are great books! Amerika by Kafka? Never read it. Should read it.), BUT they are cash only! At a book store!! Where a typical purchase is probably more than $10! But cash only. So I put my books back, apologized for not having cash, and walked out (probably never to return). If you're a high school student near Franklin or a parent of such a student, this store is probably great (so long as you have cash on you), but for regular readers/book lovers, it's not a great store. B&N in Cool Springs or Landmark Booksellers are probably better options.",

  "text": "Great diner-esque food with a huge pastry bakery case up front. My friend and I were getting hungry and I've seen signs all over for Ponzio's and thought it would be a great time to check it out.\n\nOur first server was a little..odd. But she had to leave half-way through and the next server was ok, but she was semi staring at us once in awhile. This was about 5pm on a Saturday and it was packed. \n\nTo start out, the green bean fries were tasty and the philly cheesesteak spring rolls were super hot, crispy and flavorful. Being as hungry as I was, and knowing I can't actually eat that much I wanted something I could easily heat up the next day as well. Answer- chicken parm with a side of angel hair pasta. Huge portion! Everything was cooked perfectly with a really nice tomato sauce. My friend got a Reuben and loved every bite.  \n\nThe menu was large with a copious amount of options. I was deciding between shrimp scampi, strip steak, blackened chicken wrap.. I was on the point of being hangry, but the chicken parm hit the spot.",

I know this is seafood in Nashville but it was literally the best food experience I had while visiting. \n\nMy friend and I arrived from a long flight from NY and had a couple cocktails at Skull's Raimnbow Room before heading over. Yet, Maci our waitress, sold me on this gin, blueberry, egg white cocktail, called Negative Space. Mind Blowing! It's like this girl could read my mind. I am a sucker for gin and egg white cocktail. I could not have been happier. \n\nThe restaurant itself felt modern, clean and spacious. I like to not be elbow to elbow when I am splurging on a meal. \n\nWe started with a dozen oysters. The oyster menu was perfect. It explained the flavor notes for each, of course some of the obscure ones were sold out. Our dinner was pretty late. I would say come as early as you can for the full menu. Also remember to check the boxes for mignonettesauce, horseradish, cocktail sauce and lemon. This was the best way to start the meal. \n\nThey suggested 4-5 plates to share. We ordered 4 after the oysters and it was a lot. But happy we got to try so many of the dishes. \n\nPoppy's Caviar - was a delicious and light dish \nOctopus salad - So good with the grapes, avocado and crunchy pepitas\nCrab Dip -  A really meaty one of the dishes, rich and comforting. Loved the cast iron skillet it was served in\nSmoked Trout - a lovely layering of flavors. With the potatoes it became a lot heavier too\n\nWe ended up taking some of the crab dip and smoked trout home and it made for the perfect morning chilled breakfast. \n\nThanks to our lovely waitress for helping us through the menu and making our experience so enjoyable. I have been singing your praises Henrietta Red, until we meet again!",

I guess to be more expeditious while filling orders, the staff has pre-bagged those items.  Not a bad Idea, I guess, but for me I like to have my pig feet, turkey necks and corn sitting in the juicy juices, yeahhhhhh baby!!!!!! \n\nThis day in particular, this Cajun's restaurant's crawfish were about .50 cent cheaper that one of the others that I frequent & the line wasn't too long either.  As at other Cajun restaurants there's a line for cooked seafood & a line for the food that has to be prepared.\n\nAll in all this place was there for me in a time of crawfish-feining, I got my fix & i was good!!!!",

  "text": "Schenk's Family Bakery on Veree Avenue in the Fox Chase neighborhood of Philadelphia, has been in the flour, water and yeast business since the early twentieth century when their first generation started baking in Germany before immigrating to Germantown  and opening their shop in 1938. Both the family and the bakery have moved around, but always remained Philly centric. Their recipes travelled well.\n\nToday, their storefront is small and lined with glass display cases and shelved walls, all full of their classic cookies, doughnuts, cupcakes, custom iced cakes and amazing pound cake. My small sample of half dozen doughnuts (glazed, vanilla iced, cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar) were all fresh, lightly yeasty and full of sweet flavor. They were perfect for accompaniment with hot coffee. \n\nThe vanilla pound cake was dense, moist and was solidly superior to any commercial effort I have eaten. Better even than Starbucks, which has been on my pedestal for a long while. It would have been great heated with a scoop of ice cream, but stood unapologetically on its own. Why they loaded it up on three sides with copious amounts of white icing is a mystery. It was truly an amazing sugar coating, but unnecessary given the quality of what it covered. Diabetic overkill. \n\nThat shelf of large Eagles playoff cakes looked great and gave comfort that they would be the hit of any party or cold afternoon tailgate at the Linc. Unfortunately, the sweetness would not be enough to change the outcome of the game to come.",

  "text": "There's something about thrifting and finding treasures that gives me goosebumps! The thrill of finding the hidden treasure is hard to explain unless you yourself are avid thrifter, a dumpster diver and a price checker! \n\nI had bookmarked my stops before traveling to Northern Liberties. And Once Worn was definitely in the to do list. As I walked up I could see a SALE rack! Those discounted racks can be the quick fix for sure. It  was my lucky day. I saw it hidden...it was a ..Catherine Malandrino dress!!! Wow! And in black! I tried to contain my glee for the true test. \n\nThen....dun dun dun...dressing room! The place that is the true decisions maker in my book.  I closed the curtain and the clerk remarked the Velcro that connects the curtain to the wall. Brilliant! I hate it when there's a little gap and people can see in. And then when I slipped the dress on..it was easily a Va-Va-Voom dress!! Fit like a glove! And I have to wear black at work some days. It was also work appropriate, flattering and feminine. There was black on black leopard pattern in the front section down. Gorgeous. \n\nI felt the need to pay and try to not tempt myself to buy the whole store. The clerk and I chatted for like 15 minutes! She was a total sweetheart! \n\nI had so much fun I told my friend who's into vintage to check it out! And from what I hear she made out like a bandit! Lulu Guinness was amongst the loot. Another one of my faves! This place is on my list for all future visits!! And I almost wanted to not review and keep it alllllll to myself but I'm too nice! Enjoy and find some treasures!",

  "text": "In spite of many hipster references on Yelp to this business, I ventured to it late on a weekend night on a simple quest for good pizza.\n\nThat actually reminds me of one of my favorite hipster jokes: Why did the hipster burn his tongue on the slice of pizza? Because he wanted to eat it before it was cool.\n\nLee's pizza is tasty, made with care and the toppings you order on a custom pie are plentiful. And from what I saw while waiting for my pizza, the wings looked good as well. Those came out to a small group sitting near me at the bar that included a man who clearly needed some food in his stomach.\n\nIn my opinion, two people can easily fill themselves on this small size pizza while enjoying a drink or two to wash it down. \n\nThere are plenty of beer options, most of which are available in coolers appropriate for a small and older grocery store. There are a handful of craft beers on draft as well and apparently they do pour some wine too...or those wine bottles are just to hold big fake roses and throw people off.\n\nUnfortunately for people like me who drink \"crap on tap,\" as Mr. Dunderbak calls it, Lee's has none of that. Not even \"crappy crap\" in cans or bottles like PBR or The Champagne of Beers. Which is fine, I get it. They kindly offer Coke products for us old souls who do like French toast, but want the actual breakfast and not a huge brown bottle at an 8.8% ABV.\n\nObviously, they keep it real simple here: Pizza, wings, craft beer. Seems like they know what they're doing and the employees openly appreciate their customers.\n\nAs I finish this review, the Yelp survey questions below include \"Good for Dancing: Yes, No, Not Sure.\" I marked \"No\" because the only folks dancing here have had way too much of that French toast beer or ABV equivalent and not enough of their quality pizza.",

  "text": "Do you ever feel like sometimes you were born inside The Matrix? While everyone one else's brain is receiving signals that say the food is juicy and delicious, all you taste is 'a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals... everything the body needs' but taste buds don't desire.\n\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nI read the reviews and came here with the highest of expectations. Immediately this place began to sweet talk me. I saw the meat smoker, which was a huge turn on! The sides were open exposing delicious pink meats being slow cooked right in front of my eyes like a sexy dance! I also saw the real wood stacked out back below a large tree with branches full of REAL LIVE chickens... yes I said chickens! (BTW the way, did anyone else know chickens climb trees or am I still inside the Matrix?) As a final act of foreplay, the interior decor was just right, like candles burning around a hot bubble bath. It had that seductive gritty down home feeling I like when enjoying BBQ. The only thing missing from this BBQ romance was blues music playing live!\n\nThe chef allowed me to sample several items since I just couldn't decide what I wanted my sides to be. They'd run out of mac n' cheese, which would have been my first preference, however, the collard greens and chicken n' rice were amazing! This took my BBQ expectations even higher as I anticipated a foodgasm once I got my hands on the pork ribs I ordered. Unfortunately, this romance was not meant to be.\n\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nThe ribs were smoked to the point of tasting like cigarette ashes. I've learned since being  an active yelper than many people crave this type of smoky flavor, but it was just too much for my extremely picky BBQ palette. I would much rather have well seasoned meat with just a kiss of smoke than eat meat that should probably have a surgeon general warning label!\n\nI also don't care for BBQ sauce. If the meat is well seasoned, to me sauce is unnecessary. Yet I found myself drowning these ribs in sauce to hopefully compensate for the ashy flavor. I emptied an entire table bottle on my order, and still with little desire to eat them, I threw away my leftovers later that evening. Other items to my disliking include the potato salad and baked beans. Growing up my mother used brown sugar to sweeten her beans and that is the flavor I'm used to, but these beans tasted of syrup or molasses, which I did not enjoy. They were also practically as thick as peanut butter.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI'm not sure why people find this place to be worthy of 5 stars, but I most definitely do not. This brief encounter felt very much like being in a relationship where everyone tells you how great the person is before you meet them. When you finally do meet them, they are presentable, attractive and say all the right things. However, in the end, they just don't perform!\n\nI'm breaking up with you Al's Finger Licking Good Bar-B-Que I didn't lick my fingers, not even once.\n\n\nSIDE NOTE - This review should really be a 2.5, but I really liked the staff. They were accommodating, hospitable and kind. Not to mention the chicken n' yellow rice was simply amazing! So I have chosen to round up instead of down.\n\n\n2016/4",

  "text": "When I tell people in Philadelphia that I'm Greek-American, invariably one of the first questions I'll get is \"What's your favorite Greek restaurant in Philly?\" which is quickly followed by \"What do you think of South Street Souvlaki?\" I have always been at a loss to answer either because I don't eat out often, and when I do it's almost never at a Greek restaurant. Also, as a vegetarian, I just wouldn't go to a restaurant whose name celebrates meat. \n\nSo when my friend Brad mentioned that he'd heard about a new Greek restaurant and would I check it out with him, I was immediately interested. From the initial reviews it sounded legit, more like the food I'd grown up eating at home rather than Greek food catering to American tastes (the many complaints about the lack of lettuce in the Greek salad were a good sign). The menu does still lean more towards the preferences of meat-eaters (gotta give the market what it wants) but there are several vegetarian options. No fish entrees, which seemed like a pretty major omission for a Greek restaurant, but the garidomakaronada sounds like the shrimp Santorini I used to love, which isn't something you find often. \n\nBut anyway, for my first visit the seafood test was the xtopodi (grilled octopus). Because if a Greek restaurant can't do THAT well, it'll never be great. The verdict? It has potential, but I have to admit it's not the way I'm used to having Greek-style octopus. Usually it's cut into pieces (thus more thoroughly cooked), and here the tentacles were served pretty much intact. The flavors were right though, and maybe this is the way it's actually served in Greece? It's tasty so still worth getting, but it's a huge portion so you probably want to have at least 4 people in your party who love octopus if you're going to order this.\n\nI chose the spanakopita as an entree, and that was definitely excellent. The pita was clearly house-made (not ready-made phyllo-dough) and delicious, and the spinach filling was really well done. This definitely stacked up against plenty of the better homemade spanakopita I've had. Brad got the meat-eater's version, the kreatopita (which had chicken, pork and lamb). I've never seen that in a Greek home or restaurant before, so I'm guessing this was made, again, for American tastes. But it must work, because he liked it. Both dishes came with the horiatiki salad - yes, this is what Greek salad is supposed to be like!\n\nMoving beyond the menu, the decor reminded me a lot of the more minimalist Greek tavernas I've been to, though still with a good dose of Greek art and elements (wall tiles, prints, statuettes, etc.) I could heard traditional Greek music over the loudspeaker but the noise level mostly obscured it - the restaurant was PACKED. Lots of big parties, families, etc. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and the hosts and servers ran around frantically to make sure that was the case.\n\nSo I'm happy to now know a great Greek restaurant in Philly! Well, close enough - a Philly suburb. Since most of the Greeks I know seem to prefer the suburbs anyway, this actually makes sense. In the meantime, I still need to find a good Greek restaurant in the city itself (eventually).",

Originally this statue was placed at the top of the stairs of Philadelphia Art Museum for the movie and then left there as a gift from Sylvester Stallone. However the museum did not consider this to be art and more of a \"prop\" from the movie and refused to allow the statue to be kept here. So eventually this statue was placed at the bottom of the stairs, to the right of the museum, where it lays now. \n\nWith both arms raised, this statue gives that feeling of hope since Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa was that underdog who took on the boxing champion of the world and went all 15 rounds in Rocky I. What a movie!\n\nJust as other fellow Yelp members had mentioned, there will most likely be a line to get a photo with this free attraction, any time of the day (even if the weather is not the most desired). But the line does move kind of quickly. Although you do see some people over do it and take more than a few photos with the statue, which will hold up the line. We saw several people doing that, which was a little annoying. \n\nBut anyways, definitely a nice keepsake photo for your travels.\n\nPlease note that if you decide to come here, there is limited street parking. Right at the bottom of the museum are loading zones only so just be sure to be aware of the signs so you don't get a ticket.",

I wish there was more seating inside because this restaurant is so popular.   Prices are decent for the food, we ordered a 3 piece, every order comes with a fresh donut!! We also ordered 2 of their flavored donuts. \n\nWe chose the ranch powder flavoring, and got some extra spicy sauce on the side. Sometimes when you order fried chicken, you end up with a soggy mess because of the sauce. Not here!! The chicken is crispy and super tender inside. I could have used more ranch powder though. I wasn't a huge fan of the donuts because  I only like yeast donuts. These cake donuts are super fresh though, since they are made to order!!\n\nThis restaurant is a must go in Philly!!",

I am a germaphobe when it comes to wearing bowling shoes and using balls that everyone and their brother has touched. \n\nIt was not my night to pick out our outing, so I was told we were going to Splitsville. After cursing myself for not overriding the decision, I armed myself with Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer and mentally prepared myself to go. \n\nThe business has disintegrated so much in Channelside that Splitsville is only open on Thursdays through Sundays. After psyching myself up to go bowling for the first time in years, I must admit I was a bit disappointed tonight that Splitsville was closed. \n\nI cannot blame Splitsville for only being open on select nights. After all, these Channelside businesses need to make some sort of profit. I only pray Jeff Vinik's bid gets approved by the end of this week so that there is some sort of revitalization of Channelside. \n\nWe plan on returning soon so I will need to stock up on my Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer and start mentally preparing myself again. I will update my review upon our next visit!",

  "text": "I highly recommend going kayaking in the swamps! It's a nice and quiet getaway from all the drinking and music on Bourbon Street. \n\nThere are 2 swamp tours to choose from:\n1. Manchac Mystic ($59 not including tax)\n2. Honey Island ($65 not including tax)\n- Use promo code ONLINE to get a discount\n\nN.O. Kayak Swamp Tour provides the option of getting picked up in the French Quarter for an additional $20 per person but my group of friends decided to rent a car for the day to partake in other adventures. Super cheap option by the way! If you are driving, make sure to have someone navigate how to get there. There isn't an exact address but the instructions they send you are accurate so you won't have a problem. \n\nThe kayak tour starts with a brief introduction and tips on kayaking. My friend and I were lucky to be the only ones that got the single person kayak and the rest were double riders. Some of my friends struggled with coordination so it's probably a good idea to let the staff know beforehand that you want a single rider. The swamp (Manchac Mystic) was beautiful! We learned a ton about alligators and other wildlife. We were lucky enough to go on a semi sunny day so we were able to see at least 4 alligators. I have to admit I was a bit scared at first but our tour guide advised us that 'gators are actually pretty dormant and since they're cold blooded, they try to conserve as much energy as possible. Also, the ones we saw were adolescents so they weren't too big. \n\nThe tour altogether was 2 1/2 hours and it was a great arm/shoulder workout but it won't completely burn you out. Make sure to take water, mosquito repellent, sun block, and cash for tip. I'd definitely try this again at Honey Island!",

  "text": "Although Mike's made my list of Nashville must-trys on a recent trip, we accidentally stumbled upon this place on a walk of Broadway on a recent trip--and boy, are we glad we did! Mike's is a small ice cream parlor, one that barely fits the patrons and its popularity. There is some effort that went into decorating this place like an old school ice cream parlor, with it's small tables and chairs, counter tops, and unique wall décor. \n\nMike serves a wide selection of handmade ice cream in a variety of different ways and they are extremely generous on their scoops. Between the two of us, we shared a single scoop of pralines and cream on a waffle cone and it was almost too much--and we're both like our ice cream! The ice cream is very creamy and incredibly delicious. In this particular flavor, there were generous amounts of praline--a few in every bite, and lots of caramel swirls. Our ice cream was truly divine and it seems like everyone else's ice cream was also delicious as no one could make it to the register without first taking a bite! \n\nAlthough we didn't venture this way, I noticed a few cool things that could spice up your ice cream treat here, such as a cookie cone or a Nutella sundae...but who needs spicing to this already delicious treat? Definitely a must try and completely worth the calories!!!",

I've been to the food court at West Edmonton Mall many times, and never really gave this place a thought in the world until one day when I was craving a snack that would keep me full for a few hours. I noticed this place while the rest of my family members were fixated on Subway and thought, eh, why not?\n\nPros:\n- In the food court near Galaxyland so it's definitely that spot for dessert or even a savory snack.\n- Serves both savory and sweet crepes, with their creations nicely presented as plastic representations at the front for you to see. Each crepe has its own name and pricing available.\n- Accepts cash and card.\n\nCons:\n- Overpriced for dwindling quality.\n- Crepes do NOT look as nice as their plastic menu shows them to be. They're lackluster and skimpy in terms of the filling. \n- Workers do not greet you, and they look like they don't even want to be there.\n\nI ordered #11 I believe which is whipped cream, strawberries. and chocolate drizzle. What I got was loads of crepe that had no filling, and probably a few strawberry slices with heaps of whipped cream and barely any chocolate. Prolly wouldn't come back if ever I'm back in Canada.",

I think I was meant to be Spanish. \n\nYelp celebrity Gerardo L took me here today for a little look at what Guatemalan food is all about. After one visit, I am completely sold. Everything I ate was amazing. The tamale was the best I've ever had. The bread was amazing. My meal was a uniquely seasoned pork dish called Cafe Adobada. \n\nIt was 50% familiar, and 50% unique... which I realize sounds weird. So allow me to explain. The taste was similar to other great Latin dishes that I've had, but at the same time, it also had a one-of-a-kind feel to it. It also had this really buttery sour cream that accompanied it... that was almost worth the price of the meal alone!\n\nFor dessert, I had a concoction of warm corn milk. Sounds gross, right? Well, it was not. It was actually pretty great. Definitely not your typical dessert, but I liked it.\n\nThe bottom line - this place absolutely rocks... and you should absolutely check it out soon!",

So we're here and we're going to smash.\n\nLet's begin shall we.\n\nWaffles:     I really enjoyed the texture, soft and crispy that's not painful to consume. The syrup was perfect accompaniment to the whole dish.\n\nMac & Cheese:     This side is fire yo, I adore the depth and meaty flavors. This dish definitely came to slay.\n\nGreens:     I can't believe I'm eating greens from a chain and it's actually phenomenal. We definitely enjoyed every bit of this dish.\n\nChicken Quarter (HOT):     WEAK, I was expecting my mouth to be on fire but it didn't. I feel as if an amateur spicy food eater can handle this level of heat. Plus the flavor was a bit lacking.\n\n3 stars, just because the opening acts should never EVER out do the main event. This spot definitely scored high marks on the side show category. High enough to forgive that excruciating wait to be seated. Anyways, it's whatever. I gave my score because I was not impressed by whatever food you're known for. People will still flock to you. Your marketing is definitely on point.\n\nThank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!",

Which speaks well of the food, and the adage of being early.\n\nI had gotten into St. Pete that day and while hanging with friends, was debating on what to eat. We ended up talking for a while and debating food spots. All I really wanted was something I can't get good back in California - barbecue! This had great reviews, a huge menu, and a parking lot. Works for me.\n\nWe arrived, and from the menu in the door there were already items crossed off. When we got to the host, he mentioned they had closed off sections already and for the quickest service would be the bar. My friend and I didn't have a problem with that, but still a weird thing to say.\n\nAs we were checking out the menu, we asked the bartender for his recommendations. He gave us a bunch, but then it turned into a sad state of \"Uh oh, we're out of that.\"\n\nStick ribs? Sold out.\nMac & Cheese? Sold out.\nPork Belly? Sold out.\nSt. Louis Ribs? Sold out.\n\nWith what options were available, we went with the following:\n\nWhat's Caulilini - Fried cauliflower in a light oil. I know, not what you would expect to order, but with a big dinner, figured something light and roughage would be solid. And these are tasty!\n\nMy friend and I each got a Texas Two Step. Mine came with Sliced Brisket, Pork Brisket, Sandi's Bacon Blue Cheese Slaw, and Fries. The sliced brisket is excellent, really enjoyed that. The pork brisket was okay. The fattier pieces were more enjoyable, but required a lot of chewing. The slaw and fries were both great. \n\nMy friend got the Burnt Ends, aka Meat Candy. GET THOSE! So tasty.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely come back to Dr. BBQ, just at an earlier hour so I could get everything I wanted. Definitely those burnt ends.",

Sunny weather not required to crave this stuff.\n\nIf you ever go in and see a tall, boyishly good looking 40-something man with tousled dark hair and one blue, one brown eye who looks like he just stepped off his surf board at Zuma Beach then you've met the owner, Mike.  And he makes this ice cream in house every single day.\n\nTo say Glazee Artisan Ice Creams is incredible would not be giving it full credit.  It is more than that.\n\nIt is truly a very sweet ice cream which for me means that I can only eat a small amount.  Those who are more experienced ice cream eaters can handle the bigger cups.  The base for his ice creams is brown sugar and this is most effectively tasted in his masterpiece Banana's Foster.  You need Banana Foster.  In fact, what you really might need is to mix your cup with both Banana Foster and the Cinnamon vanilla.  Yes, I believe this will do the trick.\n\nFear not because Mike will let you sample his creations free of charge.  Sometimes he does a buy one get one free.  Most importantly is that you come here immediately and partake in this Nashville treasure.  And tell all your friends to do the same.",

First time coming here and have to say it won't be my last!\n\nThe place is absolutely massive - they have a separate section for banquets/parties/events and then the main dining section (by the buffet). So back to the food.  Best part - dinner buffet is only $14.95! So cheap. Food is actually really tasty and hot. There are a few salad/fruit selections but I was saving my appetite for the main dishes.\n\nThere were 12 dishes (8 vegetable and 4 meat):\n\n- Rice\n* Lemon rice (yummy)\n- Palak paneer\n* Aloo gobi (delicious cauliflower, potatoes and interestingly this one came with slices of tomatoes and cilantro)\n- Vegetable pakora\n- Chickpeas\n- Lentils\n- Guferati (green beans)\n\n- Lightly battered fried fish\n* Goat curry (perfectly tender)\n* Butter chicken (nice and creamy and perfect sauce to complete my naan) \n- Mysore chicken\n\nNote: * means you should eat these dishes for sure.\n\nReally like the wide selection of choices and how there are lots of vegetable dishes to choose from.  Service is super friendly - staff take your dishes and fill your water/tea constantly.  \n\nNaan is made fresh to order and was delicious.  Nice, fluffy and warm with perfect crunch to it.  Music is hilarious - top 40 DJ remixes but it is in the background and isin't too intrusive.  Just not what I would expect at an Indian restaurant.\n\nStuffed as always from buffet but we were able to get a few bites in for dessert. They had gulab jabun (mini honey soaked donuts), mango custard (EAT this - nice and light) and kheer (rice pudding).\n\nAll in all, really good quality and tasty Indian buffet! Go and check it out.",

  "text": "La Tour has moved to the funk zone and their space is leaps and bounds bigger than the old space. Even the restroom alone is bigger than their old space.\n\nAlso, expanded open times! Now it's 6 days a week, 11 am - 2 am (closed Monday). Liquid lunch, afternoon break, the \"happy hour\", night cap...covered.\n\nThey are sharing 222-4 Helena with The Pub, and the interior is sleek and industrial, and a little rock and roll. La Tour's side still serves up European wines by tasting flight (5 for $10), glass, or bottle, and now they also have charcuterie plates. Big yums. \nThe cured meats are made locally by another chef, and the afternoon I stopped by my selection was duck prosciutto and duck rillettes. \nThe cheeses came from C'est Cheese, another local shop, and my selection was Brillat-Savarin, and Epoisse. They'll change the cheese depending on mood, request, or what you're drinking.\nMy plate also came with housemade mustard and pickles. And little toasts and wafers. It cost $12 and was excellent, complemented by La Tour's wines.\n\nWith the increased space, they now have two certified sommeliers on staff, and I'm told there is no other business in town that has this. These guys are serious about knowing their wine and making recommendations for you. Yet, they are super friendly and approachable. They are both local boys, too.\n\nMy girlfriend went with a glass of Burgundy, recommended by the staff to complement our cheese selection. I was in a celebratory mood and started with a tasting, but didn't get past the first sip of a fresh bubbly prosecco and ended up with a glass of that, which was fitting for not only their opening weekend, but the weekend Fiestas. Viva!\n\nOn another visit, a Saturday night, the shared space was hopping busy. This makes La Tour better for being a social wine bar. If you want a quieter time for serious tasting with an eye to buy, it's better to go during the daytime.\n\nIn joining the Funk Zone, they're just a hop away from many other spots along the Urban Wine Trail, and bars like Reds, and a, uh, juice bar like the Spearment Rhino. This could make for interesting evenings indeed, and parking will probably get tight. Then again, maybe you shouldn't be driving.",

  "text": "I love historical buildings, and the old world charm associated with them, so when my friend said he actually found an affordable bed & breakfast that is more like a hotel (and supposedly haunted!), I was really stoked. We'd have the best of both worlds: a concierge available for questions and issues like you would have in a hotel, and the coziness of a B&B, both working side by side. They call these types of places boutique hotels for their small size, and their independent character.  We had no idea that they would operate in such an odd manner, though -- nothing like a traditional hotel.  For starters, there is a check-in time, and if you are unable to meet it, they send you this rather terse email with instructions as to where to find your room key, and you're not really told much about the parking.  \n\nWe had no choice but to arrive late, considering St. Petersburg is 5 hours away and we were coming on a Friday night, which means, we had to wait until the workday was over to head on the road.  Sure, I feel bad about checking in late, but I had never had it become an issue anywhere, because I normally stay in hotels or motels, and there is someone on-site 24-7.  It was also something out of my control, living all the way in Miami Beach.  My friend and I parked in the lot next door, and we suddenly realized you had to pay to park.  By the way, parking in that lot is not guaranteed, if it's full, find somewhere else to park along the street and lug your bags.  We had never experienced this, ever.  There wasn't even valet parking.  We could not pay for parking any later than 6 a.m. because that was the limit on the machine, and the lot had a tow-away sign, leaving my friend with no option but to set his alarm to 5:30 a.m. and go out to speak to staff and resolve the parking situation...except there was no staff yet at that time, so he was stuck paying by the hour once again.  Eventually, we did sort the parking issue when staff arrived later in the morning, but $10 a day for parking seems steep.  We were also told the minute we checked out, the car had to be removed.  We could not stay parked in the lot for a single minute or we'd get towed.  \n\nThe hotel itself is very cute and charming.  There is jazz music playing outside on the porch, so you can sit on the rocking chairs and relax.  The dining room is pretty, and classy, though small, but it is a small hotel after all, so it is meant to be cozy.  Breakfast is included and it is decent: muffins, cereals, tea, milk, orange juice, and other goodies. Don't expect omelettes, bacon, sausage, or a full carving meat station though.  The place is clean, and well-decorated.  We excitedly pushed into our room to check it out, and it was extremely cozy and homey, unlike the typical hotel.  You felt like you were staying in someone's guestroom.  The transom windows and doorknobs were from a time past, and they successfully integrated modern touches like the chandelier decal behind the bed and the flat screen TV.  \n\nThe bathroom was my favorite part.  I find it interesting how many people complain about the bathroom being \"small\", but I did not find it small at all.  Maybe that is because I am not a fan of large bathrooms in the first place, as that means a smaller bedroom, and I don't know about you, but I spend more time in the bedroom than the bathroom, so what is the point of a large bathroom and tiny bedroom? I had no issue with the bathroom, and in fact, was grinning ear to ear when I saw the clawfoot tub because I knew I would enjoy it later.  In fact, the next day I ran out to CVS and bought bubble bath and took a luxurious bath, to the sounds of Ella Fitzgerald on Pandora.  Very classy! All that was missing was the champagne! By the way, if you do want to use the tub, you will need to ask the concierge for a plug for it, but the plug doesn't quite seem to fit the tub.  Also, our cold, moist towels were never replaced and we had to reuse them, so there is definitely room for improvement.\n\nThe bed was comfortable, as were the pillows and sheets, but there was this loud \"drip drip\" sound.  I found the noise was coming from the window unit a/c (the cheap way to provide air conditioning, rather than central air).  I tried to make it colder, change the temperature, the speed, nothing.  I put in earplugs, and I could still hear it, to give you an idea of the loudness.  To say this was irritating is an understatement.  The next morning when I mentioned it to the concierge, he said it was the water dripping from the unit above our room.  When I asked what the solution was, he said none, unless I make him stand outside our window all night long holding a cup.  I understand they underwent an extensive renovation, but they forgot the most important detail a hotel should have: no noise while sleeping.  That is, after all the purpose of a hotel, is it not? It would behoove them to also get central air conditioning in there, to prevent the pesky dripping sounds.",

  "text": "Have you seen the movie Tampopo?\n\nIt's an old Japanese movie from 1986 and the main theme is about making good Ramen. Everything starts with the broth, and you can tell a broth is good is by watching whether if a customer finishes the whole bowl or not. In Japanese society, it's also very polite to slurp your noodles as this is another sign that the Ramen is good. \n\nHowever, in the west, it's very impolite to slurp your noodles as I caught myself doing after receiving my bowl of Ramen. \n\nBefore getting to the good stuff, let's rewind a little bit. \n\nFound this gem of a place thru Yelp (surprise) as Wifey was searching for a place to eat. Since we were in downtown Reno and we already drove past Sparks, I quickly bookmarked the place to try the next day. That was this Sunday, and we went here on Monday during Memorial Day. Glad they were open since their secondary location was closed. I called them first just to make sure they were open.\n\nLocated a couple of miles North of John Ascuaga's Nugget, it was easy to find. It's tucked in a corner of an unassuming strip mall that hasn't been updated since the 70's. It's not much to look at from the outside, but you never judge a book by it's cover...you already know that. \n\nOnce you set foot inside, everything just lightens up as you get whisked away in some part of Japan. The walls are decorated with bamboo panels and the tables and chairs are in perfect harmony with one another. From the decors to the paintings on the wall and even the fine chopsticks that are arranged in a bamboo holder on every table. They even have a section of traditional Japanese tables on a tatami mat where you have to remove your shoes to eat at. The place had a Zen-like vibe to it, and I was digging the tranquility.\n\nOur server, Jackie, was superb as she was warm, friendly, efficient and fast. We had a party of four (Me, Wifey, Son and Mother-in-Law) as we got seated and checked out the menu. I noticed a note on the menu describing the place was established by Chef Yoshi from Japan, who has also worked in China and France perfecting his craft as he wanted to bring the first authentic Ramen experience to Reno. \n\nBoy has he succeeded. \n\nWe ordered three bowls of Tonkatsu ($7.75) with extra Chasu/Pork ($2.50) and one bowl of vegetarian ($7.75). I also ordered a bowl of Chasu Salad for starters. The broth is described as white, light and creamy extracted from bone marrows that are slowly simmered. (Did your mouth just water?)\n\nSalad was a mixed green with chopped pork, corn, bamboo shoots, soy beans balanced together by a sesame sauce. It was light, tasty and a nice starter course. \n\nThen came the Ramen. The extra Chasu comes in separate bowl and I quickly realized that all sides comes in their own separate bowls, which made for a nice visual reference. You can also control the portions of how much you want to add. \n\nFast forward to me slurping like a slobbering pig.\n\nThe broth was light yet tasty. For me, it was an excellent broth since it wasn't too salty unlike some other Ramen places where they sodium content is thru the roof. It was a perfect balance of richness, creaminess and deliciousness, and you can always add some soy sauce or chili powder to your liking. I choose not to add any condiments as I was enjoying the flavor as it was meant to be. The pork was also superb as it was tender and meaty with all the porky goodness that a Bacon-lover would approve of. \n\nThe only negative thing on the Ramen would have to be the noodles itself - some were clumpy and chunky. Ramen noodles are supposed to separate easily and not get stuck together. However, it was a minor detail that I was willing to overlook as I was thoroughly immersed from the broth with my head down slurping like a Nihonjin. \n\nLike the movie Tampopo, I finished the broth as well as my wife's bowl.",

  "text": "My recent date-night at Irwin's was everything I wished it to be and more! It was definitely worth the wait! \n\nFun fact: Irwin's is named for the architect, Irwin T. Catharine, who designed for The School District of Philadelphia from 1920 - 1937. He is responsible for over 80 school buildings in Philly including Masterman, Palumbo, Overbrook, and this stunning art deco inspired building, BOK!\n\nThis space located inside the (somewhat) newly repurposed BOK school is so eclectic. They left graffiti on the walls, kept some other original features and mixed it with mid-century modern pieces, lots of candles, greenery and a breathtaking, dramatic crystal chandelier at the entrance. I TOTALLY dig the vibes! Excellent design details! It's absolutely a place for a romantic evening out and an awesome addition to ever flourishing South Philly. \n\nWe actually wound up switching our reservations to an earlier time to catch a movie afterwards and walked into the space just as an electric sunset was taking place. That unexpected bit of magic set the tone for the rest our our evening here. (Try to come for sunset! Between the outdoor space and all of the large open windows, you'll have an awesome, impressive view!)  \n\nWe were seated at a quiet, corner, candlelit table by large windows. It was perfect for cozying up and sharing these delectable small plates that are inspired by the cuisines of Turkey, The Mediterranean and the Middle East. The dishes that brought my tastebuds right back to some of my recent trips around the world were memorable...the sea bass, the lentil rice cake, the baked haloumi with dukkah, the sweet potato hummus topped with sweet pomegranates, even the simple the seeded crackers and perfect grilled pita. Everything was so flavorful and complex...except the baba ganoush. It just wasn't as smoky and garlicky as I'm used to or how I make it. Definitely not bad by any means, it just didn't have that punch I crave in the classic eggplant dish. Other than that, I would absolutely order all of the plates again. They were excellent. (They say 2-3 per person is recommended and I would say that's accurate. We left satisfied but not stuffed, which on a sexy date night, I feel is key!) \n\nThe drink list is impressive. Unique beers, solid wines and cocktails ranging from classics to innovative. The cocktails we had were stellar! Their namesake, 'The Irwin', was strong and sexy. It was a deep with the walnut bitters and garnished with a thin slice of orange peel and a soaked dark cherry at the bottom of the highball glass. The pink 'Aviation' was a sweeter, lighter, more \"girly\" drink, shall I say. Both good. Very different. \n\nOur server was very welcoming and super attentive throughout the evening, and the hostess was kind and was gracious, snapping a few photos of us in the super cool space. \n\nIt's really a special place, one I enjoyed immensely. It's reservations only and it felt very exclusive with the check-in at ground level and the guided elevator ride up to the top floor. \n\nOff season, just as they opened was a neat way to experience Irwin's (especially for the very first time) and when we could have the place basically to ourselves. I cannot wait to return. I would definitely like to come in warmer weather and sit outside, although popping out there on a chilly night was still spectacular as I believe this is the best views of the city. I would die if they started opening for Sunday brunch (Hint, hint if anyone capable of making that happen is out there reading this!). \n\nIrwin's is not for everyone as the portions are on the smaller side and priced higher according to effort, but it's certainly for us. I cannot praise Irwin's design team, staff and chef enough! \n\nExcellent date choice! \n\n*The parking lot directly in front of front door belongs to Irwin's and is free to use for patrons.",

The second half of the hike is a lot more challenging, but so worth the effort. It's s extremely well maintained trail.

  "text": "When you talk about hidden gems, Goleta Red Distilling Company immediately comes to mind. It's hidden inside a Goleta industrial business park off Castilian and Cortona Drives. Often the owner Michael will put out a sign at this intersection mentioning tastings that are happening. You'll find a door next to a window with an awning, enter there, then follow the guided signs to their tiny tasting room connected to a massive distillery. \n\nI originally found out about Goleta Red at a past Official Yelp Event thrown by my predecessor Stephanie W (https://www.yelp.com/biz/oye-sips-samples-and-sweaters-goleta-red-distilling-company-goleta?hrid=a6i2sWY0wVSZElPv8pX4og&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)). Since then, Michael has been active at local festivals, on social media (Instagram and Facebook) and even offers a deal on Axxess card for 2 x 1 spirits! The minute you enter the door, rosy-cheeked Michael befriends you with his wonderful energy and one man show. While this happens to be his business, it is more of his hobby and passion. He provides tastings of all his liquors: Sterling Silver Rum, Solid Gold Rum, Cacao-flavored Rum, Orange Java Overproof Rum, Fiesta Agave Spirit \"Tequila,\" and Goodland Gin. I'm normally not a fan of gin, but the Goodland Gin possesses a beautiful botanical/herbal flavor profile that stands out in any drink. You can even find it at some bars around town! Once you have tasted a pour of each, then Michael offers one of his creative boozy concoctions made with his own spirits.\n\nThis past Halloween, my partner and I came in here while he was open for pre-Trick-Or-Treating. We wanted to make that custom a bit more tolerable with the hoards of kids. Michael mixed up a Ghostly Pumpkin and Corpse Reviver 2. Both were super unique and went down easily by being well-balanced. Michael is fun to chat with and is extremely knowledgeable about distilling given that he loves to educate himself and explore novel techniques--whether or not he succeeds or fails. If you haven't already checked this place out, be sure to!",

  "text": "All things considered, I enjoyed the food at Capri as well as the customer service. I stayed at the adjacent Budget motel that for two nights while on business in Boise (that's another story) and tried Capri for breakfast during BSU's graduation weekend this year. This location is quite festive in the morning, given its proximity to the motel and other businesses on Fairview Avenue. \n\nStarting with the food, I would rate it 8/10. It was pretty good (slightly greasy), yet palatable. I was so hungry that I really didn't want to waste time eating fast food anywhere on Fairview Ave, so I chose the meat lover's omelette along with a side of hashbrowns and a cup of coffee. I think that I paid a total of $11 before the tip. Very filling, which served its purpose in not keeping me hungry for several hours.\n\nThe seating is not bad at all. There is a bar area (where I sat at), as well as side tables on the far left of the dinner wall as well as within the front and toward the right of the venue. The bar area had some very \"interesting\" conversation from travelers and locals alike, which actually lightened up the mood. The servers were attentive and very sweet, and made sensible recommendations on the food items listed within the menu. \n\nIf the decision came to choose fast food versus this location, I'll take the latter for $500, Alex.",

At the time of our arrival, there wasn't any General Tso slices available to pop in the oven and serve. Despite the fact that our group didn't want to buy an entire pie, they happily made one up and let us buy individual slices. \n\nSo the General Tso slice is unique and combines two of my loves: pizza and Chinese food.

  "text": "I was torn between rating PF Changs 3 or 4 stars.  The food is good, but it's a far cry from real Chinese food. The service varies depending on the server... We've had great service, horrible service, and a lot in-between. The cocktails are horribly overpriced so my husband and I normally just order a pot of hot tea, which is incredible. Since we live close by we typically grab our food to-go in the curbside pick up area.\n\nThis P.F. Changs is located at the Westshore mall so it's always packed. I'd highly recommend making dinner reservations on Friday and Saturday nights because it can be at least a 30 to 45 minute wait after 7pm. The bathroom is poorly located next to the bar so you have to fight a crowd every time you want to go to the bathroom.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the food is tasty; just not authentic. The lettuce wraps and dumplings are two of my favorite appetizers on the menu. There are many mild and spicy dishes on the menu depending on your spice preferences. We enjoy a lot of spice so we usually order the spicy green beans and the Cho's Spicy Chicken. The honey glazed chicken and the wonton soup are also quite good.\n\nI have never ordered dessert here, but I have tried a handful of the cocktails and they are usually too sweet and fruity for my taste. Be cautious of ordering cocktails that aren't listed on the menu. The bartenders have disappointed me on numerous occasions with poorly made Dirty Martinis and Cosmos.\n\nAll in all PF Changs is nothing special, but the food is consistent so you are guaranteed a decent meal.",

  "text": "Another awesome find in Chester County! The owner is so nice and very knowledgeable about the wines they have. My mom and I came here with a friend and we each did a wine flight. You can mix types of wine and you get 4 total, which equals about a glass and a half of wine. My favorite that I tried was the pinot grigio. We ended up getting a bottle of it and a bottle of the Reserve Cab Sav (which is not available in flights). I loved the Cab Sav too! \n\nThe owner gave us some free samples of their wine slushie and OMG were they amazing! They were the perfect treat and not too sweet. I definitely want to come back and get them again.\n\nOverall, this is a super fun and cozy winery! They do different events on the weekends, so be sure to check out their website!",

  "text": "While North is no longer owned by Fox Restaurant Concepts, they've maintained their formula/consistency, which is what I always appreciated  about  FRC restaurants. Knowing what to expect is nice, even for takeout the food is a-ok. I still have not dined inside of a restaurant but continue to support with takeout. We ordered online on a Saturday evening, the wait was about 35 minutes. They did not offer curbside pickup but I am sure it they would gladly accommodate the request. Our order included the calamari, meatballs, braised  short rib with polenta and the branzino. The meatballs and braised short rib are always good. The branzino was a touch overcooked but still good. And the calamar I think it best enjoyed at the establishment since it's fried. \n\nIf you are comfortable with dining in, North is open for both indoor and outdoor dining. \n\nThey are adhering to the Pima County guidelines regarding COVID19.",

  "text": "I'm going to be upfront about my dislike of the parking situation in Down Town Tampa.  So when I got to the location, finding parking was hard! I ended up across the street at the parking structure for the Glazer Children's Museum, which was charging a singular priced parking due to Phantom Of the Opera going on at the Straz. \n\nThe walk to Anise wasn't bad, the lights were in my favor, and the scenery was nice with all the Christmas lights glowing in the early evening.  What I found distasteful, was the host- a young man in his early 20's, with light brown hair- wasn't paying attention to the door, he was head down over his phone, likely texting or checking Facebook. I had to speak up to get his attention. Only then did he let me know where my party was.  \n\nMy party was that, a company Christmas party, about 25 people in attendance, drinks and appetizers provided by the venue. I have to admit, though I was a bit concerned over the offerings, I was actually quite happy with the flavours! We had curried chicken wings, curried deviled wings with lobster and vegitarian paninin.  All were delicious! I -LOVED- the deviled eggs, there was just something about them, they were TOTALLY off the chart. \n\nThe decor is amazing! I loved the bookcases in the bar area, the hydropinic greens in the lobby and the light fixtures that hung down from the high ceilings. This place has character! I can't wait to visit again, and am hoping that Anna will be my guide next time because I have a feeling I'd be out of my league!\n\nHats off to the Tender with the amazing dreads, Jarod(?) Sorry if I got the name wrong. He was really warm and friendly, totally LOVED his attitude!",

We purposely picked a table that a server had briefly cleaned so that she can see that we have sat down. \n\nAfter waiting more than 15 minutes and trying to get a server's attention, we decided to leave.

  "text": "You can find Il Bel Lago at 11631 Olive Blvd, St Louis, MO 63141 in a suburb called Creve Coeur almost due West of St Louis as the crow flies. The restaurant is in a protruding part of a shopping center almost hidden by lit trees (not sure if it's due to the holidays or if they're always lit). Entrance is to the right as you go around the corner and parking is in the lot out front. The interior is upscale with an elegance usually reserved for fine dining, but the atmosphere had a younger, frenetic feel that I found quite refreshing. Apparently the restaurant's original name was Bellagio but there was some dispute with the owner's of the hotel that ended in a name change - lucky for me the food retained it's very good quality.\n\nThis is perhaps the best meal I've had throughout several visits to St Louis on business the last few years. Sue T (a friend and coworker) and  her husband Carl graciously took me to Il Bel Lago and introduced me to the chef, Frank Giovanni. Afterwards we were sent a nice \"combo\" style appetizer that featured a delicious lobster ravioli and a  veal tortellini with shitake mushrooms and peas. The flavors were both unusual and offered great contrast to each other.\n\nAs I always do, I tried some of the local craft brews rather than going with wine - in this case the Schlafly's Pale Ale won the lottery as my initial try - honestly I didn't care for it much, preferring the hoppy bitterness of an IPA - this was a bit too lagerish to me with a bit of an oily mouth-feel that didn't work for me. I also ordered a Caesar salad that had an anchovy nicely sandwiched in parmesan crustini. For my second brew I switched to a standby Ranger IPA.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Spaghetti Gamberi, Cozze & Vongole - homemade spaghetti (almost an angel hair) with gulf shrimp, fresh mussels and clams in a white wine light san marzano sauce. This was quite delicious with a good amount of fresh garlic that provided little bursts of flavors as you eat the pasta and sauce. Also, the shrimp were quite large and filling - absolutely love this dish.\n\nWe forwent the dessert but ended up with these little chocolate and creme (with some type of booze) parfaits that were quite good. Not on the menu, I think they called them chocolate cows or something similar?\n\nService at Il Bel Lago is quite exceptional - our server was knowledgeable, courteous and quick to deliver. We couldn't have asked for or expected better. Thank you Sue and Carl for introducing me to this place - I hope to be back!",

  "text": "People know me for my high heels and penchant for expensive cookies. I like being just so fresh, so clean, and generally take my sangria on a Southern California patio with my ladies in maxi dresses and wedges. Don't hate. It's just how I work hard to roll. \n\nBut, I grew up in the mountains and camping with my family. I can build a fire, I can build a fort, I can shoot a gun, and I'll bet I could chop some wood if I absolutely had to. If the apocalypse was upon us, you'd want my tasty cast iron pan skills all up in your shelter making mean ass cowboy stew. Just sayin. \n\nThe girlfriends and I decide that we should take a break from our status quo and start a new tradition: Gourmet Camping once a year- and so, the 2014 crew of myself, The Polish Princess of P.O.P., The Master Chef Selary and The Sexy School Teacher took a trip up North for a couple days. We packed the car all by ourselves too. (Keep reading for actual campsite info-hey, story telling is a camping tradition right?) \n\nThe menu? Gourmet indeed. From fire kissed meatballs wrapped in onions over bacon cheese hash followed by marshmallows stuffed with rolos toasted into cookie smores to crepes with blueberries and paninis with mozzarella and spinach: WE dines like the queens of the forest. We made campfire pie oven biscuits and corn on the cob with roasted tri tip stew and mini apple pies. \n\nOur tent was a virtual nest-we made micheladas and sangria and played card games by lantern light. We checked in Saturday and stayed till Monday AM. \n\nIt all sounds lovely, and it was-except for a few things: \n\nThe drought: Not the campsites fault at all-but it was dry as a bone out there. The allure of the creeks and rivers caused us to make a reservation there-but they were at least a 5 mile drive to find, a disappointing turn of events. The campsite this dry is very dirty and dusty. Any other time and with more moisture it would have been perfect because of the big oak trees and shade and greenery-but California just isn't surviving this situation very well. \n\nExpensive ass firewood. 6 dollars for a small bundle. They don't want you bringing in outside wood-so its a racket. \n\nThere was a water pump, but no showers, bathrooms were okay. We could smell them though so EW.  About 20 miles inland from Santa Barbara so it was in the 80's and pretty humid-I dont suggest it at all for summer months. \n\nOn the weekends it's full of peeps, but spaced out. Sunday night caused the grounds to empty and left us alone with just a few other campers. You can still have fires here as of July 2014-but I expect them to ban them shorty with how dry and crispy it is out there. \n\nSite # 25 is a good location that's mostly shaded and near the water, but downwind from the bathrooms. This campground is the 3rd one along Paradise Road and more spacious than the others. \n\n#gourcamping2014 ended up being just ok, kinda like this campground. Next year we might just pitch a tent next to the patio here in SD and call it good-but who knows? The adventure bug might bite me again. Just like the mosquitoes from this weekend. \n\nPS: those who know me IRL, ask me about the harrowing night #2 titled \"Almost Dying In The Forest\"",

They were very friendly and surprisingly not busy. Why didn't I get 2 dozen???",

They had a bit of a line so we walked around and came back when the line had diminished. As a result, we had our food within about four minutes of ordering.\n\nI am glad that we gave them a shot! We both had asiago bagels with cream cheese. This is a New York style bagel food truck so the bagels were steamed instead of toasted. The results of steaming instead of toasting a bagel is that you wind up with a bit more chewy and flavorful delivery. The cheese on top does not scorch at all and remains in place. The cream cheese almost liquefies from the heat and seems to melt into the bagel a bit. End result...a great snack!",

  "text": "Why 4 stars?  Because this gym is awesome!!\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nPowerhouse was already a pretty good sized gym when I started there, but after its recent expansion, it is now ENORMOUS!  \n\nI had no complaints about Powerhouse, but I did recently leave the gym after over 2 years of being a member.  I went to Harbour Island Athletic Club because of a group discount program that I was offered.  I have a feeling I will return to Powerhouse one day though, because I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.\n\nAll of the equipment is in great shape and mostly kept up nicely.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  There is a kitchen/smoothie shop inside to make it impossible to avoid eating healthy.  There is a giant staircase in the middle of the gym, representing the famous Santa Monica stairs in California.  There are many other features that you can check out on their website, but I never did the group workouts or classes so I can't say much about them.\n\nJeff Trager aka The Knot Doctor has an office located in the back of the gym, which a huge bonus for me because I have been going to him for years now.  Jeff is the man for any kind of injury that could possibly require a standard or deep tissue massage.  He is ART (Active Release Technique) certified and is the team therapist for the Yankees when they are in town for spring training or playing the Rays.  I recommend him to everyone that has any physical ailment, because he has fixed several problems for me over the years.\n\nIf you live or work in the Downtown/Channelside/Ybor/South Tampa area, I highly recommend Powerhouse Gym.",

  "text": "Tucson, AZ (Rita Ranch): fantastic!\n\nAwesome service and delicious food. We were seated immediately, arriving just before HH ended. When my House Margarita arrived in blended form instead of \"over the rocks\", the serving staff apologized, removed the erroneous drink, and promptly returned with my proper order, a simple but well composed drink where I could taste the tequila not in slushy form. Complimentary, house made chips, light and crispy, and salsa with a bit of kick, made for a great  start to our meal.\n\nFOOD\nGreen Chili Pork Burrito w/rice & beans\nShredded Chicken Taco w/ rice & beans\nOff menu Chorizo con Huevo \nShredded Beef Chimichanga w/rice & beans\n\nI was surprised at seeing just a 3.5 star rating. This was our friends' favorite Mexican restaurant. We had to agree it was good. The rice was savory and moist. The refried beans were creamy and topped with melted cheese. Hubby thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast for dinner, his chorizo con huevo (sausage with eggs). My chimichanga shell was crispy and the generous shredded beef filling very tender and flavorful. Both our friends' taco and burrito did not disappoint. Our server stopped by at least three times after our food arrived to see how we were doing, and even brought out a second bowl of chips. The water glasses and iced tea were continually refilled.There is a bar and Happy Hour (2-5pm every day) is also served in the dining room. Two separate non-gender specific restrooms. Excellent service, delicious food, located in a strip mall with a small lot, accessed from southbound Houghton, south of Rita. Would love to come back to try more of their menu.",

  "text": "In a few words: community staple, affordable, fresh, and healthy.\n\nLovely outdoor produce market in Webster Groves. We live in the city and therefore go pretty far out of our way to shop here. We typically go at the beginning of every week, either Monday or Tuesday, and it's never busy! Better yet, they are open 7 days a week and all year round. I imagine it's a little more crowded on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nTheir produce is local whenever possible. So, when you buy here, you're supporting big and small local farms... who wouldn't want to be a part of that? They are across the street from Webster University, so they provide affordable and healthy options for students, staff, and visitors. \n\nNot only do they have fresh produce, but depending on the season, they have different plants, flowers, and herbs. During the holiday season they have live trees you can take home to adorn your living room!\n\nOn top of all of these offerings and availability, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They always know where their food comes from and are readily willing to share that information. Rogers has been open for 40 years and counting. They have the perfect thing going to keep their regulars and grow their business.",

  "text": "Why O why do I do this to myself? My visits to Coyote Ugly (now numbering 3) make me th butt of some cosmic joke. Usually, I enter due to some weather-related event.  My first visit to a CU was in Atlanta. It was 95 degrees with 70 percent humidity. I would've entered a lava flow to cool off at that point. My second visit, I was walking through the streets of Chicago with an old friend navigating a near blizzard. We noted the flashing beer sign and took heed. It wasn't until we saw the questionable body shots that we'd realized we'd entered a CU. That brings me to the Fourth of July and the monsoon of 2009. As attractive as the fireworks were, looking up into a downpour, well, there's an old legend that turkeys are so dumb that they stare into the sky during a storm and die drowning.  Gobble, gobble.\n\nSo, in a move that still doesn't demonstrate we're much smarter than commercial livestock, we headed for the nearest bar.  That bar? Coyote Ugly. I should've known what to expect.  I'd forgotten what to expect.\n\nIn short, you get a long bar that tries desperately to capture the vibe of the movie. Does it manage to do so?  Not quite. It truly is hard to manufacture a party, even if you've got all the beer in there world.  You might get a party; you might get a bunch of angry drunks. Crap shoot really. That night, it was a bunch of sad, wet, drunken refugees seeking escape from the rain. The bar girls did their bar dance as per the movie only to be met with angry, rain-soaked eyes. As the rain subsided and the beer sank in, revelers tried their level best to catch Hepatitis by attempting body shots to the sound of frat boys yelling \"Woooo!,\" but it all seemed so \"The Accused\" to me that I drew my wife closer and warily steered clear of any pinball machines. Finally, the rain slowed to a drizzle and we took our opportunity to leave. Yes, I'm old. Yes, I'm a hipster douchebag. Yes, I'm not their target demographic. And sadly, yes, most likely due to global climate change, I'll probably find myself in a Coyote Ugly some time in the forseeable future.\n\nTwo stars.",

During this strange time, booze has played an important role in preserving sanity. I didn't do a lot of drinking, but I kept on collecting, and Craft made that incredibly efficient and easy with the great updates to their online store. On any given day you could visit the site and see most of the current inventory, add it to your cart, check out and then head to the store for pickup. Initially it seemed they did it simply because they weren't allowing the public inside, but they kept it up and it has remained current and a great way to shop here.\n\nThis is no small feat. Keeping an e-commerce site up is a lot of work, but Craft did it to keep us all hydrated.\n\nDuring these strange times they have also been incredibly helpful with special requests. I've recently been interested in Irish whiskey and really wanted a bottle of the new Redbreast small batch cask strength, and Ty was able to get it and make sure I had a chance to get one. \n\nLastly, the non alcoholic options are also fantastic. Picking up dinner nearby and needed some soda, so I figured I'd pop in, check out the whiskey selection and grab em! We picked up some great booch, cane sugar cola, and a sparkling martinelli's!\n\nAll perfect. Grateful for this store!",

But one cannot judge a restaurant on its decorations alone!  \n\nI couldn't decide on what to order, so I opted for the combination meatballs and ravioli with spaghetti ($15).

The Nashville musician cousin recommended \"Crema,\" out of many local coffee destinations.  \n\n\"Crema\" is located near the Ascend Amphitheater, where the Tennessee Titans play.  When our group arrived at the Sunday morning at around 10am, this place was PACKED.  \"Crema\" has its own parking lot, beautifully-decorated outdoor patio, and comfortable indoor seating.  I was truly impressed by this wonderful piece of real estate and definitely looking forward to trying the coffee made by their in-house roasted beans.  \n\nSince hubby and I were planning on getting back to Chicago as early as we could, we had our drinks to-go.  The staff seemed to know how to deal with the crowd; the team worked quite efficiently together.  One of the baristas was exclusively responsible for making the pour-over, while others shared other tasks to ensure all the orders were fulfilled in a timely fashion.  \n\nBy the way, they have an extensive pour-over menu.  Unfortunately I didn't think I had much time to wait for the coffee (10-15 min).  \n\nI, therefore, opted for the iced Cuban, latte with sweetened condensed milk.  Unless you absolutely reject anything sweetened in a beverage, give this one a try because the sweetness was very subtle and sophisticated.  \n\nHubby, on the other hand, had the \"coffee soda.\"  It essentially is carbonated coffee, mixed with Demerara sugar, and topped with orange peel.  I wouldn't say it was particularly tasty; it was rather interesting since it had an unexplainable \"bitterness\" when I had the first sip.  It was similar to drinking iced black coffee with a \"punch.\"  \n\nI could easily see why \"Crema\" is a popular hangout joint for the locals and visitors.  I also gave this place a high praise and hopefully will make it back at some point.",

Need silence, They have a sound proof working booth with a stool and laptop shelf if you need to hop on the phone. I wanted to try it, but it was occupied during my visit. \n\nThe parking here is awesome! There's a huge garage    right behind the venue with a ton of free parking with an on duty security guard.",

  "text": "I could eat one of these salads every few days. Crushed Red makes me want to make better salads at home.  The salads are the shining star at Crushed Red.  Flatbreads could be better.  \n\nOrdering at Crushed Red takes work.  First flatbread orders are taken if you are getting one. After you place a flatbread order you walk to the salad station.  The mini salad is a lot more filling than it looks.  If you are getting a flatbread, appetizer, or soup...only get a mini salad.  If you are eating the salad as your meal, go for the regular.  The salad choppers will build you a salad of your dreams...just tell them what you want.  I always ask for my dressing on the side.  I love ordering the Create Your Own Salad which comes with four toppings.    \n\nThen you go sit down...Parmsean Cheese?  Roasted Garlic?  Red Pepper Flakes?  Jump up and walk towards the front door.  You will see a small station with these items and small cups.\n\nSuper fast, ultra-casual.  Quality ingredients.  On-line ordering now available.",

We experimented with 3 delicious drinks; Elite Status (in honor of the Elites) which was a lightly sweet, citrusy mix consisting of Gin & Moscato.  Second we concocted The Kentucky Hug (my fav) and I'm not even a Bourbon fan but this was superb!  I love Merlot mixing fresh Cherries, Simle Syrup and Bourbon made this drink similar to an adult Capri Sun (less sugary though) .  Lastly, we sipped a traditional Sangria.  Delicious but more of a heavy taste with Dry Red Wine, Ginger Ale and Brandy.\n\nThis was a great afternoon lesson; can't wait to get Goosed again.",

They were drunken and loud.  Awkward.\n\nBecause of the noise from the bar, we opted for a seat in the small side room.  The restaurants decor and food are old school.  Dark rooms, white table cloths, a couple of big dusty metal knights and an empty fireplace were the primary features in our dining area.\n\nThe menu is old school, pricey, rich, and meat heavy.  I don't mind paying $25+ for food if it is special, but  it wasn't. \n\nWe split a number of items.  The shrimp scampi was basically two shrimp on pasta with bland cream sauce. Not a traditional scampi presentation.  The crab cakes were decent, but also served on the pasta with the boring, rich cream sauce.  \n\nWe ordered the meat flight special ($30).  It was decent, but rich and overpriced.  The twice baked potato was old and nasty.  We finished with the recommended bread pudding, which was apple and peach soup with a few soggy bread chunks floating in the middle.  Overall, the experience wasn't good.  The food was rich and overpriced, the bar noise was obnoxious, and I left feeling sick from something I ate.  \n\nPositives were that the entrees include salad/soup and sides and our waitress was very nice and split the food for us without charging or being asked to.  \n\nSoulards needs a menu and restaurant makeover and they need to put the bar in its own room if they plan to keep the band of merry men around.",

I was quite happy to be reunited with the Ghost of Mary, one of my favorite spin-offs of a Bloody Mary that I had long missed since the closing of Swift Half. After several of those, our table decided it was time to share the Mummer's Punch. The serving suggestion is for 4-6 people, and we had three with two latecomers. There was more than enough for everyone. \n\nTwo people at our table were at The Industry long enough for brunch and dinner. I heard good things about brunch but can only report on dinner. The burger with bacon was good, not great. I'm not going out of my way for it, but it is a decent option. The pickle mayo (which I asked for on the side) provided a nice dipper for the fries. A lot of the menu consists of items for the more adventurous palate (sweetbreads, pig ears, bone marrow, lamb neck, etc.). I am most definitely not in that category but there were still plenty of things to choose from. I'm interested in trying the porchetta sandwich and the fried green tomatoes.\n\nOur servers were great and very attentive throughout our long stay. The music selection was awesome (although the Internet jukebox provided for some say in the matter - not complaining at all, just an observation). I'm looking forward to my next visit.",

We were bummed, but accepting of the fact that we would be able to receive free tickets to attend at a later date. Since we were in the area anyway, we decided to walk over just to see if anything had changed from the earlier reports. Luckily, we picked the right time because we were able to get in only a half hour after our original appointment time. While we waited, a glass of wine and some live jazz helped pass the time. \n\nOnce inside the collection, it was clear that we wouldn't be able to take everything in during the designated hour. But what we did see was absolutely incredible. And I'm pretty sure my buzz from the wine (and okay, the beers we had at a bar nearby before that) added to our enjoyment. We'll definitely return once the initial excitement wears off so that we can enjoy the works with less of a crowd. But in the meantime, a walk around the gorgeous grounds (that are actually still in-process) isn't out of the question.",

I did try the Johnny roll and wish I had ordered that over the cornbread. \n\nButttttt I gotta stay true to my stomach. If you are truly looking for good jerk chicken that's spicy and full of flavor, bomb dot comb cabbage, and amazing cornbread---next time you are in GEORGIA try visiting Kelly's Jamaican Foods.

I had read once that this was one of Anthony Bourdain's favorite NOLA restaurants, and from there decided to research further. Chef Nathanial Zimet previously started out with a truck he called The Que Crawl. And just like some of our most ambitious and creative young chefs/restaurateurs here in Southern California, he worked his way to a unique brick and mortar place of his own where he could better assemble a team to help with his vision and passion.\n\nUnlike SoCal, Boucherie, like many other great NOLA restos is housed, well, in an actual house and not some random strip mall. Not only was the ambiance warm and inviting, so was the host and our waitress, and every other staff member that we encountered. \n\nBoudin Balls were mentioned in several other reviews, so after the refreshing amuse-bouche we requested an order. Loved the contrast in textures, with the fried crispy outer and soft slightly spicy inner of the mixture of pork and rice. They came with a tasty homemade garlic aioli sauce on the side for dipping. \n\nMy entrée of choice was what was called Jerk Chicken. I have been to Jamaica twice and have had it several times here in the Lower 50, and this did not taste as though it had any traditional jerk seasoning. Semantics schemantics! Once my brain got over the fact that what I was tasting was unlike what I had before, twas a non-issue. Whatever seasoning that was used resulted in possibly the best chicken recipe in memory. Not only tantalizing to my taste buds, but so juicy and mouth watering. Will remember this for a long long time. Included alongside was a 'cheesy arepa, plantains, & wilted greens.'\n\nWe shared some wonderful collard greens that had grit fries resting atop, that we agreed were the best greens also in memory. \n\nDefinitely worth the drive, or Uber fare, if you are staying in The Quarter, can't recommend highly enough. Now added to my NOLA must hit list for future trips to this incredible culinary city.",

They use a very cheap grade of meat and when they cook it, they chop it up so fine that it becomes pulverised till it's like the consistency of baby food. It's chopped and grilled to death! Pagno's gives you a lot of meat-which is what the budget-minded consumer loves, hence the reputation. But again it's a cheap grade of meat so I'm definitely not feeling it. Then they use a regular Amoroso roll! And any Philly sandwich aficionado will tell you that this roll will not stand up to a lot of cheap meat. The result is a sloppy, gooey, smelly hot mess.

Gil introduced me to these delectable treats that are golden caramelized cakes on the outside and form a rich rum custard on the inside.\n \nThe brass or copper fluted pans are coated with a thin layer of organic beeswax which helps to harden the outside, sort of like the topping a creme brulee would give and allows the rich custard to form its base within the center of the cake. This magical confection dates back hundreds of years from the Bordeaux region of France.\n \nMade from milk, eggs, butter, flour, rum, homemade vanilla, rum ( did I say that again ), sugar and a bit of orange zest, the custard batter is baked in a mold, giving the canelé a caramelized crust and custard like center.\n \nThe Market Day Canele' makes them right here in Philadelphia when you can not get to Parisian patisseries or the Bordeaux region of France. They sell them at La Colombe at Rittenhouse, Pumpkin Market., sometimes Whole Foods on South Street has them, Clark Park Farmers Market, The Piazza and at Headhouse beginning in May. Folks can order them by contacting Gil@MarketDayCanele.com.   \n\nMy caneles' never made it home, but I can not wait to buy many more of these bite sized treasures to enjoy with an espresso, a cold glass of milk, a good wine or a glass of champagne. A gastronomical delight.  I want a canele' or three right now!",

The giant Bavarian pretzel was amazing. Our group unanimously agreed that the housemade beer cheese sauce was better than the stone-ground mustard sauce. Unfortunately, the wings were dry and bland and our server forgot to bring us blue cheese so the wings were cold by the time we got to enjoy them. I'd have to try a few more items from the menu before I can determine whether or not to forgo ordering food here.\n\nAmazing beer and cocktail list, but our party was disappointed to find out many items on the menu were sold out. My brother-in-law was super stoked to try out the Cask Ale, only to find out it was sold out. When my sister ordered a second Pineapple Ginger Punch she was told that the cocktail could not be made again because they just ran out of ginger beer. When she selected a beer on draft she was told that it was sold out as well. \n\nTIP: If you are waiting for a flight (the airport is only a 5 minute drive from the bar) you can watch your flight status on the flat screens at WOB.",

  "text": "I wanted something Original, Local and Authentic. I found the Columbia Restaurant in Ybor city and insisted that we go for dinner. \n\nI love to cook and eat Latin food, so I really looked forward to trying it their way. They have in fact been open since 1905, with the recipes influenced by Cuban, Spanish, European, etc. I loved the stories behind the dishes in the menu. \n\nThe Sangia is a must, the only question is which one to get. We went with the suggestion by our bartender and ordered the Red Sangria made from Imported wine, fruit and brandy. It's got a kick to it, but smooth enough to keep drinking. \n\nI was told by several people and saw in several reviews to try the 1905 salad. We ordered a side salad and split it. It was pretty big. The salad is pretty damn good and left us thinking why was it so damn good, was it the dressing or the olives, the cheese? I need the recipe. \n\nWe ordered a Cubano to split, which was HUGE. It was very good and served with plantain chips. The bread was sweet, yet toasted and it was very filling.\n\nWe also ordered the Gambas Al Ajo which were these huge shrimp sautéed in garlic and chiles and served in a clay dish. This was served with fresh hot Cuban bread and butter. \n\nAlthough we only ordered a small salad, one sandwich and a tapa plate, we were stuffed. I loved the restaurant, the food, the service and would most definitely come back. \n\nPlaces like this need to stay around, so that newer generations can appreciate the Original, Local and Authentic food and establishments  that built Ybor City and Tampa Bay.",

We used to come here way back when it used to be called VISIONS. It's been 20 years since we've moved out of Reno. Time flies! They have updated the club, and they now have a patio in the back. I didn't like gay bars when I was younger, and I still don't like them now that I am older. I just find them very depressing.",

From chicken to ribs, everything fell off the bone.  The gumbo complimented the brisket.  Your choice of sweetened iced tea, help yourself.  Being Asian, I wasn't used to the sweet tea stuff, my mama would slap me if I added sugar to her hot tea LOL!  At the same time, I was overwhelmed with all the different foods and down to earth people.  I finally experienced Southern Hospitality, and they had football playing on every TV.

If you're not as old as me you would know Rocky starred as that old main guy from the Expendables.  \n\nAnyway one of the best parts of this classic movie is when Rocky is training and he ends up running up a large set of stairs and puts his hands up while a panoramic view of the Philadelphia skyline shows in the back with this inspirational music.\n\nSo this is the place made famous by Rocky who happens to have a statue just around the corner by the way... This is the Philadelphia Museum of Art and faces towards city hall along Ben Franklin Parkway and towards Logan Square.\n\nYou will always see people coming here and taking photos with their arms in the air and in case you didn't know why, now you know.  \n\nThis place is a wonderful place to get a photo of the skyline of Philadelphia also by the way and at the other end of this road that leads towards city hall is a JFK park where the \"Love\" sign is that is also good for a photo opportunity looking towards the museum.",

They were actually happy that our night was about to be made SO much better by ordering this pie.\n\nIn short, Love & Honey is true to their name.  Delicious food served with a lot of love, and some honey.\n\nThe fried chicken was outrageously good.  Crisp, well seasoned skin, and moist on the inside.  The cornbread was superb as well.  And the pie, well I already covered that but it was gone so fast that there was no time for a picture.\n\nBest fried chicken in Philly hands down.",

No problem.  It was a 4 star day and nice to see the wide variety of products.\n\nBut TODAY I decided to order a breakfast sandwich.\n\nFAIL.\n\nFor $2.49 (You order at the counter - she writes it on a colored post-it note and then you go pay a la manual Wawa) I chose egg & cheese on a bagel.

I spent a good 2 minutes trying to pick off pieces of soggy wax paper from the bagel.\n\nThrew half out - it was unsalvageable.\n\nAte the egg and cheese insides with a kinife and fork - eggs were nuked and horrible.\n\nNEVER again for an egg sandwich - but yes for a quick stop for \"packaged\" goods - and they have an expansive cold beverage selection.\n\nCashier and counter folks were friendly - but please, take heed - NO MORE NUKING the egg sammies, OK?",

  "text": "What a name box of Cubans, sounds like it might be a cigar store. But it's not. This place is a hidden hidden hidden g e m. Best Cuban sandwich in my current memory. And with all the places I go who knows about my memory. But I'm sure this is a top-level you got to try it you got to go there Cuban sandwich. Now first in order to find this place you drive down the street and it's a little tough. It's hidden inside a convenience store behind the gas station with the little green circle I think BP kind of gas station. Sign is on the big standard out front beneath the gas station stuff and as you walk up to the convenience store there's a smaller Circle that says box of Cubans on the right. Now that you know how to find it get out there and find it and have a great meal. Now back to our meal. Cuban sandwich at all the right attributes that a pure Cuban sandwich should have, including a Cuban family making it. Apparently this running a restaurant has been a dream and a passion for this man and his wife. They are living the dream, and we can participate and be part of that dream by coming on in and having another sandwich or their black beans or my gosh the green sauce that they made to put on the pork I got a little taste of it oh my God it was great. Now I also had an empanada and I have had a lot of empanadas around the country and this one was Far and Away the best. Finally something where the pastry on the empanadas was thin and balanced with the meat, unlike some of the ones I've had with quarter inch thick pastry. This place is where you need to go for lunch in fact I would say call ahead take 10 sandwiches back for the crew at work this is the way to have a meeting and a great lunch. These people are so nice and they're cooking is so loving get on down there and have a good time I did. And I'm going back next time I'm in town. I sure hope it's soon. I can meet up when you live 2000 miles away",

  "text": "Amazing drinks without the pretentious hipster vibe. Two thumbs up.\n\nI live in Florida, because I am an old person at heart. I may be in my late 20s, but I don't like going to places where it is hip to be seen. However, I still want the offerings of a trendy bar. I want the creative drinks and the modern décor. I know, I'm a walking contradiction. Well, luckily Repeal 18 gets me. First of all, who knew that this bar existed in the heart of Westchase? A high end clothing store, or a coffee shop would make more sense (and those both exist in the same complex). You know this bar has to hold its own to survive here. There is no hopping to another bar. You come here and you stay here.\n\nThere is a lot to stay here for. As I mentioned earlier, the drinks are very creative. They have a Mexican Martini that is absolutely delicious. It has the right amount of kick. Also very good is their Pisco Sour. I don't think you can go wrong ordering off their cocktail menu. We came here at around 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday. Although that would be super early for a normal bar, it wasn't for here. There was a good amount of people already milling around. \n\nThere's a dart board and a pool table. There is also outdoor and indoor seating. \n\nI really like this place. It is definitely a keeper.",

But TLA always manages to give you rare reasons. their obscure themed racks are the perfect reason to walk around and give in to the cinema gods.\n\nI also got to give it up to the staff. They're definitely the friendliest bunch of film snobs around. Definitely appreciate them for tolerating my random film choices, and having the decency to save laughing over my absolutely horrible choices for when I walk out the door. I might not always agree with their personal choices (I don't always agree with mine either) but the majority of times their dead on and know what they're talking about.\n\nAnd if weren't for TLA things like the Philly Film Fest wouldn't be as fun. They work hard every year to bring in the most diverse selection from all over the globe, with plenty of debut directors, documentaries, and crazy horror. the end result might not always be the best. but just like the store it always celebrates the true diversity that is cinema. and this TLA is my personal favorite.",

I mean what other bar out there lets you pick up a happy meal that includes 2 hot dogs, a PBR pounder, and a toy for 5 bucks?\n\nThe PBR and shot specials flow endlessly throughout this chill spot that lies under the El. But they also have a rotating Beer of the Month specials and a variety of drinks that go well above the average dive. \n\nBut the best part of the El Bar is the eclectic offerings that you'll come across on any given night. Its small stage showcases plenty of random punk rock shows throughout the night. Foo Truck has started showing up on special nightly occasions giving you a chance to enjoy delicious yet healthy wraps and veggie offerings. With a table top Mrs. Pac Man, random arcade games, and ample -PINBALL ALERT- it provides some good drunken video game moments. And you'll find plenty of subtle perks like a decent happy hour, and a cool outdoor courtyard.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, El Bar is clearly a dive that gives you more to love!",

  "text": "I have never slept so well in my life. Ever since we had our Temp Pur Pedic - Cloud Select Queen size mattress delivered, I have experienced the most sound sleep. I think my dreams have even improved sleeping on this mattress. \n\nOur last mattress was bought only 3 1/2 years ago from one of those stores that sells closeouts, \"as is\". We thought we were getting a good deal. When actually we were taken. \nIt did not take long before the mattress felt and looked like two Sumo Wrestlers had either slept or wrestled on it regularly. We suffered as long as we could. We had to break down and get a new mattress for the one that had broken down. \n\nWe did our research and knew we wanted to go Temp Pur Pedic. It was Columbus Day weekend and the majority of the mattress stores were having their annual sale. In the mail we received a sales brochure for Mattress Firm and looked at the addresses and headed out. Our salesperson Sean was great, he listened to our wants and needs and recommended a couple different mattresses. He was not high pressure and knew when to step away so we could talk about our decision.  When he stepped back into the conversation, he let us know which ones were in stock and those that we'd have to wait for. We selected our mattress, added the protective mattress cover and applied for the 24 month same as cash. \n\nOne week later our new mattress is delivered. When the young men making the delivery arrived I jokingly said, \"Hey, you're not the guys on TV'. Without missing a beat, the spokesman replied, \"No, we're better looking\". He was right. The delivery guys were clean-cut, polite and professional. I was shocked how fast they brought the new one in, unwrapped it and had it positioned on our platform frame. We had them take our old mattress away to be recycled. They quickly wrapped the old one in the plastic wrapping from the new one with ease and went out the door. For those that are concerned, yes they put their little booties on at the door. \n\nWe spoke with the customer service department at Temp Pur Pedic before shopping to find our who they recommend as a retailer and were informed that Mattress Firm is one of their \"Elite\" retailers.  This Elite Yelper recommends this Elite Temp Pur Pedic retailer.",

  "text": "For all you faithful Yelp friends who read my reviews, you know that I am a lover of high quality stationery, paper, pen and ink shops like this.  So like a moth to a flame, I was drawn into this beautiful shop in downtown New Orleans which also happens to be on one of my favorite streets in the French Quarter.\n\nLet me start by saying that the owners are wonderful people.  This becomes almost immediately apparent upon entering.\nThey are welcoming, helpful and kind. \nTheir store is irresistable and so lovely with eye-catching items everywhere you look.  There are beautiful writing implements, inks and ink wells, exquisite European stationery, wrapping papers, calligraphy sets, gorgeously bound journals and the like.\n\nAs I browsed around, I suddenly espied the sealing wax and seals.  Oh my.  Years ago when I was in junior high and high school in NYC, the ancient practice of affixing one's seal into a pool of colored wax on the outside of envelopes had been resurrected.\nSeals and sealing wax were readily found in shops everywhere.\n \nI still have my original initial seal that I used back then.  Nary an envelope left my hand for years without my seal across the flap.\n\nThe use of seals on letters and documents can be traced back to the Old Testament and I've always thought it a lovely way to close an envelope with a personal logo, totem or initial. \n\nHere, I found an array of Italian-made seals along with an assortment of richly colored waxes.  I fell hard once again.   \nAll things considered, given the things that I love and that interest me, I should have been born a few hundred years ago. \n\nBoth the owners showed me some new sealing techniques which include using both wax and ink stamps.  I walked out with two new seals, an assortment of inks and quality wax sticks and I'm all set now to emblazon the envelopes on my soon to be written out Christmas cards and envelopes.   \n\nIf you're into beautiful pens and good inks as my husband is, this too is your place.\nThere is a wide variety from which to choose of both.\nThere are many things here that would make wonderful and unique gifts.\n\nIf you can't get to Royal Street in New Orleans any time soon, check out the website.\nThis is a small, local shop and any questions you might have I'm certain would be readily answered via phone call as well.\n\nStopping in this pretty shop can't help but remind us of the art and beauty of writing by hand and creating something lovely with quality materials.",

  "text": "I've seen a number of reviews from folks who have held events at the Artsgarden and yes, they do have some legitimate criticisms about restrooms and access to a space suspended above the intersection of Washington and Illinois Streets.\n\nBut my review is based upon the main purpose of the the Artsgarden:  To showcase the local artists through a series of public performances and visual art exhibitions.  It also serves as a \"cultural Concierge\" providing information about that arts and cultural activities in the area, making it possible for visitors to take in the events when time and money allow it.\n\nThe Artsgarden is run by the Arts Council of Indianapolis.  There is a lunchtime music series several times each week called \"Garden Jams\".  Local professional musicians are scheduled to perform for the lunch hour Noon to 1 pm for no charge to the public.  So, whether you are just passing through the facility from one building to another or have grabbed a lunch and decided to take a seat, there is frequently music/entertainment available.  The Arts Council website has a list of performance dates and talent schedule for the month.\n\nEach month, there is also a new visual exhibit, not limited to professionals, so you may find works from emerging artists, students, and  different cultural and social organizations.\n\nAnd I would be remiss if I didn't mention this amazing physical structure soaring seven stories into the downtown sky.  Lots of glass makes excellent viewing for a birds eye view of downtown.  It's one of my favorite buildings in the area.\n\nNext time you are downtown, especially for lunch, why not check out the Artsgarden for a cool place to check out the arts of Indy!\n\nReview #484",

Food was as expected for a game room. Once inconvenient aspect was having to go to the desk to purchase game cards. Other places have machines to purchase and refill cards which cuts down having to wait in line at the counter. It's okay and we'll probably be back.",

My old gym (Weston Fitness, see review update) had lost it's luster and began charging extra for my favourite class, so we parted ways after 2 years of having a really good thing going. It felt serious.\n\nAnyways, I never think about Weston anymore because Unite has totally swept me off my feet. The class format keeps things moving and helps you challenge yourself in manageable increments. I'm still sore after every class and constantly looking for more time in my schedule where I can squeeze in another class here and there. I can't get enough. I've done classes with Bill and Juliet and they are both incredible. I always end up dripping sweat and I'm not much of a sweaty person so that really takes a lot of effort for me. They are positive and motivational and great teachers.\n\nCan't speak to the locker facilities much because I always go home beforehand to change and then go back home afterward, but they have lockers available with locks so I don't have to schlep my padlock anymore. Love that.",

  "text": "alright, let me give it to you this way... i LOVE steak! i LOVE meat, in general. so i was totally looking forward to bob's steak house as it is known as one of the best steak joints in tucson. my personal opinion, it's definitely not the best steak i have ever had in my life. my hubby and i still talk about how disappointed we are. we paid the same as other high end steak houses yet left feeling just not satisfied. \n\noverall, staff were nice. very courteous! food came out at a great pace. would i come back? no, as i have personally had better flavorful steak in my lifetime. i am however very thankful that they allowed us to bring our daughter with us. they also allowed us to be seated earlier than our reservation.\n\nordered:\n*Lobster tail-tasted a bit fishy to me. Definitely had an after taste after every bite. \n*Cream corn- not very sweet. There really wasn't much flavor to it. I felt like I needed to add something to it to give it that omph factor. \n*Sautéed mushrooms- huge mushroom pieces. \n*Kids chicken tenders- came with a drink a side. Which we got fruits. \n*crab cakes- fell apart very easily. Not the typical crab cake I've had in the past. This was the best tasting item I've tried here. \n*cote de beouf bone in 22oz-$55 made perfectly medium. Lacked in flavor. I ended up dipping it in ketchup to make it go down. a good piece of seasoned meat should not need me to add any additional flavoring to it.\n\nFree bread- holy cow us this thing humongous! It's like where do I even begin! Now eating it would result in one of the following: it won't look cool anymore, guilt as I ate way too much bread, guilt I didn't finish it and now they're gonna toss it and I am being wasteful. Either way a lose lose situation for me. \n\nbob, you are definitely a solid 3 stars. thanks for your hospitality! \n\nTips:\n* free self parking. \n*reservations accepted. \n*cash and credit card accepted \n*they have high chairs. \n*they have kids menu.\n*restroom is available.\n*dimmed lighting.\n*full bar is available. \n*located on the golf course.",

Oh, and it's just so damn delicious!\n\nWe came in for Reno Restaurant Week, and it was such a treat for so many reasons! First, I got to support one of my favorite local businesses. Second, Reno Restaurabt Week have me the perfect excuse to get out of my South Reno bubble and visit. Last,the deal was tough to pas on... $9 build your own regular sized bowls. That's exactly what I order, only a few dollars cheaper, so how could I resist. Well, I didn't, so I added a scoop of protein which made it the usual $12, but I'm not complaining at all because this was exactly what I'd been craving.\n\nI could tell you all of what went into my bowl, but instead I need to make sure you know just how good their sauces are at Pola. Combining these with the fresh cut seafood is what makes these bowls next level. \n\nI usually stick to their traditional sesame shoyu, but Pola is always changing and they introduced a Yuzu Pepper sauce that was about the best thing I've had in a while. It made everything pop and it'll be my new go to every time.\n\nNext... Crispy Garlic Chili Sauce - ooo la la. This goes on their spicy tuna, which isn't that chopped up stuff you get elsewhere. The sauce is like hot oil you find at Chinese restaurants, and a little goes a long way. I would add this to the sesame shoyu for kick but always add it on top of my bowl, along with spicy mayo to finish it off!\n\nThe possibilities are endless at Pola, and just love it! No photos because I was so excited to eat it!",

At lunch time on a Tuesday I managed to find a meter just on the next block. \n\nUpon entering I discovered that you place your order at the counter and they call your number when it comes out. There were only a few people in front of me, so the pressure was on to figure out what I needed to try. Luckily the guy at the counter was super helpful. In the end I went for a Burnt Cheeseburger with a Duck Patty and added bacon and a side of half Sweet Tots half Waffle Fries. \n\nBurger - Going with the Duck Patty was a solid choice! It definitely had that rich, buttery flavor that duck should. And I thought the burnt cheese was unique and had a deliciously sharp flavor. The bacon was thick cut and the pickles were obviously house made and fresh. Honestly, I'd probably just get this burger again on my next visit!\n\nTots and Fries - The tots had a mild sweetness, but you really do need a dipping sauce for them. The waffle fries had the perfect crunch and would be great on their own, but I loved dipping them in ranch. \n\nI also appreciated that this place doesn't up-charge you for everything. No extra charge for the fancy patty and no extra charge for any sauces. This place is great!!",

But I waited for the perfect time to savor a bite from their all vegetarian menu, and after I picked up one of their vegetarian pork banh mi sandwiches I was whisked away to divine providence.\n\nFor a tiny food cart Kung Fu delivers a swift karate kick of options. from veggie pork banh mi, to ramen with tofu meatballs, and more. and they even have it nailed down to sides like dried fruits or vegetarian beef jerky. Next to the fabled tofu hoagie from Fu-Wah their veggie pork was the best vegetarian sandwich that I ever savored. their banh mi ingredients are nailed to to the vibrant and traditional, and they definitely manage to cater to your preferred level of spiciness.\n\nAnother plus is how well they travel between different areas of Philly. So whether you catch their Dragon cart across from B2 on Passyunk, find them in Clark Park during a West Philly farmers market, or other you best take note.",

Fortunately they have a deal where you can get an appetizer/soup/salad, an entree, and a glass of wine for $35 which isn't bad for the quality of food and service.\n\nIt's a small restaurant with a bar on the right as you enter, fine linens with fresh flowers and an open kitchen which is quite rare in fine dining joints. Our server Valerie was attentive but not overbearing.  I dined with three friends and we all got the special. First we had the hot sourdough rolls which were yummy and I love real butter! Then I ordered the crab cakes (which were yummy crab without breading-see my picture) and fried mirliton-delicious! One friend ordered the chargrilled oysters which I tasted and it was yummy, and another friend ordered the scallops which she enjoyed. For my main dish I ordered the tenderloin which had blue cheese on top and had shredded beef underneath. It came with snow pea pods (I think) and a potato side.it was tasty! My friends ordered the flounder and they enjoyed it. But dessert was the best with a creamy creme brûlée with whipped cream and fresh strawberries on the side-amazing! And we so had the flourless chocolate cake with strawberries and cream on the side which was good. I don't remember what kind of red wine my friends ordered but they all enjoyed it. And I liked the Pinot Grigio that I ordered as well.\n\nIt was a lovely experience and we closed the place out where they had to turn on the lights to kick us out! Hehe\n\nHappy Dining!",

There were all of these blue bins and I thought that it was just some of the supplies that they were using to brew their beer. To me it was interesting that they would just sort of be out in the open. After I got about halfway through my beer, I realized that this wasn't just a brewery, it was a place that sold supplies for people who make homebrew and wine. I know absolutely nothing about brewing beer or making wine but that didn't stop me from walking around and taking a look at the wares. I've got to tell you that I wasn't really sure about what half of the stuff was, but it looked pretty cool. There were cheese cloths, corks, tubing, live yeast, dry yeast and hops for days. There was a guy in there with a buscarte and long list of supplies that he needed, and it was cool to see him stocking up. Like I said, I don't know anything about making beer, but what I can tell you is that I've never actually seen a place that offers supplies for people who want to brew. For me, that makes this place very unique.\n\nAfter we completed the Taste of Seminole Heights tour, we came back into Southern Brewing and had two more beers before heading home.\n\nLoved the place, loved the staff and will definitely be back.",

There was nothing particularly outstanding about the food, which is a shame because the total came to about $30.  The amount of food was fine for what we were going for (just a little something to tie us over for the film) but $15 does not warrant \"snack food,\" you know?\n\nI wouldn't be against coming back, but I probably wouldn't suggest it, either.",

The weather was perfect, and almost all of the animals were out and very animated.\n\nIt was cheap too, $12.50 for adults, plus we had a coupon so we got in for $10 each.\n\nThis zoo is kept up very well, and the animals appear to be happy in their element. Very few of them are behind glass or screens/bars. It is a very open zoo, and the layout is beautiful.\n\nMy favorite parts were the gorillas, the orangutans, the swamp area and the white tigers.\n\nWe also found getting there to be very easy - we took the street car up to Audubon Park, it drops you right in front of the park entrance. You can either walk the mile through the park (no thanks) or just wait a few minutes, and somebody will come pick you up in a Jeep and take you to the zoo entrance. When you are done at the zoo, hop back in the Jeep and they take you back to the street car - all for free. How awesome is that?",

Stay dry in all the weather St. Louis can throw at you and ride the garage elevator up to the forth floor.  Picasso's has an entrance in the hallway so you never have to go outside!\n\nPicasso's Barista's make some amazing Latte's.  The Milky Way Latte is the best coffee house blend I have had to date. It is pure bliss in a warm mug.  The Milky Way is Chocolate, Vanilla, and Caramel.  The Snicker Latte comes in a close second.  The Snicker blend is Chocolate, Caramel, and Hazelnut.  The Black Forest is also very good.  The Black Forest is Chocolate, Cherry, and Almond.  You really can not go wrong with any of the above Latte's...go ahead and indulge!\n\nOnly bummer- if you order a Venti your latte will be served in a to-go cup.  We did not see any signage about this and were not told when order was placed.  I guess I can save some money and order Grande's only.  \n\nIt seems they have already outgrown the seating they have at this location.  There is plenty of floor space for them to add more seating in the future.  \n\nI look forward to trying the Nitro Cold Brew this Spring or Summer.",

HH specials include $1 oysters and clams, $3 shooters, along a discounted beer and cocktail.  Once we managed to get a seat, our service outright sucked.  I'll blame it on our waitress, who seemed more interested in gossiping with friends than taking orders and getting food.  Yet, even she couldn't push our spirits down thanks to some top quality oysters and a pair of shooters.  We enjoyed everything so much, we decided to give clams a try... ok, turns out they aren't are thing.\n\nIn the end, we'll certainly be back.  Of course, we'll be hoping for a better waitress since they ran out of chowder thanks to her slower than slow service.

I've been checking it out since around the time of it's beginning. But it took me a while to find it on here just because of the fact that I affectionately call it Compass just because of what it logo and sign remind me of (I guess I'm a dork too - http://wwwdelivery.superstock.com/WI/223/1538/PreviewComp/SuperStock_1538R-47673.jpg).\n\nOverall the store is an interesting treasure trove to walk through. It's filled to the brim with interesting books, cool shoes, soap. nice looking bags, addicting T Shirts, and other cool trends of fashion. But to be honest the main flaw to a lot of the items on the whole can be the price tag. While I love and am sold on the idea of owning a Chewbacca and Moustache Logo T Shirt, I'm not necessarily sold on the idea of owning them for $34 a shirt. And that's just the basics.\n\nBut at least that price tag does go to a valuable message statement. And here's only part of it -\n\n\"Our story begins in Philadelphia, a city of Brotherly Love, do-it-yourself initiatives, and collectives of inspired artmakers. Since 2006, Art In The Age of Mechanical Reproduction has existed as a vehicle through which modern thinkers marry reverence for enlightened ideals with the mandate to reach more minds in an ever-fickle urban scene. Our community of free thinkers and artistic innovators delivers inspiration and aspiration back to The People.\"\n\nAnd that's the exact idea that runs rampant inside of it. It gives local artists a shot and supports free thought on every given occasion. And it does it ten fold during First Friday since it's in Old City. You'll enjoy a fine beverage such as root alcohol and check out a DJ just like I did. And there's worthy theme of art or history (or both on the wall), and plenty of interesting fashion to take in. And it is Idea's like all of the above that are worth supporting in the long haul.",

I got the cucumber, cherry tomato, mango, pineapple and last with shiitake mushroom which not use by most poke place. They have the protein and mixed in combo with sauce and stir the mix before put in to the base. Good technique. \n\nThe topping selection has 4. I got crab meat, seaweed salad, octopus and masago. Considering this good topping. Food is a bit expensive but has good topping and base. I would make some changes with sesame seed, bonito flake and onion crip to free add on instead count as topping.

You can get a basket and a lock for free along with the bike.  Driving down State Street during Cinco De Mayo traffic was half fun and half risky because you just never know if some drunk college kid turns right into you.  I recommend going up through the residential area to the SB mission which is beautiful and a much easier ride especially on the way back (because its downhill).  Loved it!",

  "text": "This place is definitely a hard \"no\" for me. I went last weekend for my friend's engagement party. We did have a rather large group - not sure what my friend's experience was as far as reservations go, but our group was for 25 people.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had already eaten so we just wanted drinks. Let's just say our waitress was not too happy at the thought of that. I did try one of their little mini muffins though - it was a jalapeño cornbread style one that had no flavor. I tried their Cajun Martini which I was pretty excited about, considering how unique it sounded. It was disgusting - pretty sure they use poor quality booze in that drink because the after taste was terrible. I didn't drink it and no one else wanted it. \n\nAnyway, the overall vibe of the place threw me off. People were raving about the performances and entertainment aspect, but we sang one song and that was it (mind you, this was also a Saturday night, when one might expect the most action). To me, Palace Grill is just some dilapidated building trying to pose as a restaurant.",

I got a pretty good sweat in the weight area and am surprised to see all the amenities here: childcare, a lot of fitness class rooms, pool, lots of lockers and even a coffee station. With all they have going on and available it's an unpleasant surprise that their showers had nothing but ICE COLD water. \n\nI left soggy, cold and unwashed, definitely not something I want to be for too long after a workout.",

  "text": "I wish I had checked out yelp before deciding to come to this spot.  The Philadelphia Chinatown area has a few hand drawn noodle restaurants.  This one might not have been the best choice for me.\n\nThe noodles had good texture, but the flavor of the dish was pretty bland.  It needed more salt, and I'm the type of person that does not like food super salty...so if I'm asking for more salt, I can't imagine how it would have tasted to someone who needs their food sodium filled.\n\nThe restaurant gets three stars because the price was somewhat affordable, and they were SUPER FAST at getting the food out to me. Hopefully I'm wrong, and maybe the seafood hand drawn noodles was the wrong dish to order. I wont be in the area to try another dish, but just this is just an FYI to all you other yelpers out there....",

They are not shy at all about advertising all throughout and on the front of the store about how they are the home of the original muffuletta.\n\nI am not usually the biggest fan of this type of sandwich (cold Italian deli meats), but this is a delicious sandwich. The regular size is definitely bigger than your head, so you should just go for the half, which is still big enough to share. I shared a half size with my wife since we just had beignets and were also planning on trying a few more muffulettas afterwards for a little taste test.\n\nIt was so good it had me wishing we got the full size one. Now that I've had the rest also, I would definitely come back here to get the best if I am in the mood for a straightforward, classic version of the muffuletta.",

  "text": "I'm happy to see that Cask has really become a staple in SoHo since my last review! I met up with a few friends for Sunday brunch this past weekend and it was nicely populated. We decided to sit outside on the front deck but I probably would recommend sitting inside during summer months around here. It was really hot despite the fans that they have (if you don't mind the heat go for it because the people watching is great!).\n\nFirst and foremost - our waitress Sydney was a DOLL!!! She was so attentive, patient, kind and friendly. Not to mention accommodating when we asked about possibly taking the table next to us for friends who wanted to join. She deserves a big kudos for her service. \n\nTo start, I ordered the $5 Bloody Mary special and it was perfectly made. I also tried a Black Bubbles cocktail ($10) which was really refreshing and a nice drink for brunch. They do offer bottomless mimosas for $20 from 11-4 (there is a limit of 2 hours to drink them if you choose this). For my meal I had the Wild Mushroom Omelette ($10) which was jam packed with ingredients and they do offer egg whites if you ask for no additional charge. The brunch menu has a little something for everyone so if you have dietary needs this is probably a good place to go. \n\nValet parking is complimentary in their lot, but make sure you have a couple bucks to tip. You are welcome to make reservations ahead of time and you can bring a group. Drinks are a little on the pricey side compared to other places in the area but are well made. They are kid and dog friendly so bring the whole family! They had a DJ out on the deck which was really nice for a relaxing Sunday. I'd recommend for brunch for sure!",

It was super delicious and the plating was beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised by the price too. For such a high quality spot, my meal was $15. I will absolutely be back for their ramen, udon noodles, and if I can get enough friends together, a future sushi boat. Do yourself a favor and visit this spot.

The Brenden Bread Pudding was absolutely delicious especially if you love pecans. \n\nOur server Anthony was friendly and attended to our table as needed.

  "text": "Excellent first experience!  We stopped to see if they were open and they had us come in to try the food while they were working out the pre-grand opening kinks!  They were getting ready to stop serving for the \"lunch rush\" and start to prep for their evening \"Friends and Family\" event.  There was no line thankfully so we walked up and awkwardly ordered our meals.  I ordered Two Enchiladas (beef & chicken) and my wife ordered the mango chicken salad.   My enchiladas were good but we decided to focus our attention on the salad because it wouldn't hold up as a left over.  The salad was great with all the different types of salsa's that were available to be added to it.  It came in a tinfoil \"take out\" dish with a fresh soft heated tortilla under it.  I liked this different approach to the salad.  I personally wouldn't get it next time because the carb load was probably pretty high and it was almost impossible not to eat because it tasted sooo good.  We also were able to try the Tres Leches.\n\n\n\nI needed to give that one space.  Because that Tres Leches was worth an entire star all by itself.\n\n\nTres Leches.\n\n\nMy daughter had a kids meal and called it good!  A picky eater satisfied is always nice with a new place.   We were also able to sample the Flan.  Man this place makes some amazing desserts.  All of the food is fresh made and they don't even have a walk in freezer.  I really like/fear the fresh made tortillas at the start of the line.  The fear is that I will indulge too much and not be able to even have a bite of the wonderful desserts.  I envy those people who can put away tons of carbs.\n\nEven though they have Coke products on fountain they also are carrying \"Mexican Coke\" with real sugar.  And are planning on bringing in other flavors of real sugar Fanta.  So if you are a soda drinker this might be just the thing you are looking for.\nThey also have a few teas and at least one flavor of Horchata available.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is nice  Lots of teal and beach colors really cheers the place up.  Stone and tile and wood moves you far from the Forrmica covered places quick serve Mexican you may be used to in the area.  They even have some big windows that can be opened during the warmer months for open air eating.  \n\nThe ordering process is similar to the other places, but has much more variety on the line.\n\nI will be coming back to try the Daily Special.  A different menu item for $6.49 each day of the week and on Sunday you get \"your choice\" of any days special for $6.49.\nMenu Prices are anywhere between $5-$8.39 depending on items ordered.  I didn't take note of guacamole or sour cream costs.  The amazing desserts are $3.49 and the kids meals are $3.99.\n\nParking is private and will be plentiful even on the most busy times because of the nearby vacant building.  Looking forward to going back and trying the Key Lime Pie as well as the tacos.",

  "text": "I stayed at Silver Legacy so many times it's ridiculous. I love the rooms and the front desk staff for the most part has always been amazing. I feel safe staying here especially when going to the elevator to get to my my room as they have security The makes sure your suppose to be there. Nothing wrong with that in my book hotel should really do this to prevent seedy character from roaming around.\n\n They have many restaurants my favorite being Sterlings they have an amazing Sunday Brunch with all the delicious fixings..lol. They also have Flavor's Buffet which is just okay and another that l can't remember the name.\n\n My last stay here was quite lack luster though. I stayed here with a few friends and family. My first room I checked into the air didn't work, so I was put in another room this time the TV didn't work and the toilet didn't flush. They placed me in another room no problem. They upgraded me and everything was great until I get back to my room to go to sleep at 2:30am. Around 3:20am I hear the people next door to me fighting and I don't mean just yelling back and front like it was physical. I hear the man screaming for help and telling his ole lady to stop hitting him she was out of control the walls banging etc.. I call the front desk they send security up immediately to remove the woman. Front text comp'd my first night for the inconvenience which was nice. They following day they put me in a even a better room \" Spa Room\" which was a very kind even though I never asked to be moved, but hey! I was going to be here a few more nights.\n\n I would have given 5 stars but, after checking out and my bank calling me 2 days after I checked out of Silver Legacy they charged my card 2 extra nights after checkout. I called and they front desk manager fixed right away and apologized.",

For those of you who are, I highly recommend giving Cajun Mike's a shot. This is probably one of the coolest dives located just outside of the French quarter. Come in, get starred at and be friendly amongst the locals, that's the key to success at a place like this. Honestly, friendliness goes a long way... The brew is awesome, typical draft selections, a couple of TVs and some pretty good local pub grub. Enjoy the experience and take it all in, especially if you're a tourist.",

  "text": "I was a little afraid of this cheesesteak. Irish pub in a strip mall doesn't scream great cheesesteak.  I saw a prime rib sandwich on the menu. I thought that was the sandwich I was supposed to try.  The bartender was convincing that he liked the Cheesesteak so I stuck with a cheesesteak.  It was on a sesame seed roll but it did not present itself.  It was sloppy and the cheese wasn't completely melted.  Surprisingly it was good.  The meat was tender and had a decent flavor.  Nice roll but I do not like it when they cut roll on an angle especially when the cheese isn't completely melted.  You're already having a tough time getting roll, meat and cheese in every bite. I also didn't like the $13.17 price tag.  I think the prime rib sandwich was $14 and it came with french fries.  I don't know, it was a good cheesesteak, draft of craft beer $6 and they have plenty of TVs.  I think it was a good overall experience.",

We checked out their selection and was pleased to find cheaper prices than other vape stores in the area. The staff was very friendly and helped her as she browsed, even recommendation a different brand than the one she had set out to buy. The recommendation turned out to be better than what my cousin was used to. The store itself has lots of items for the experienced smoker and seems to have lots of inventory and variety. We had a great shopping experience and didn't feel pressured to buy or try anything that we didn't want. Excellent shopping experience at Straight Pipes & Vapes.",

The service is inconsistent and while friendly could be more attentive to details.  The food is decent and they have nice freshly made tortillas.  The prices for several items seem higher than the nearby Taqueria Guerrero.  They have a breakfast menu that could appeal to those who like indulging in that meal with a Latin flair.  Overall I would generally prefer Taqueria Guerrero except the fresh tortillas here are some of the best around.",

  "text": "I have a problem.\n\nI have been thinking about the vegetable samosas from Desi Chaat House a lot.  It is causing a serious interruption in my daily functioning.\n\nSometimes I will be in the middle of a conversation and I will pretend to get a call so that I can go outside, hail a cab, and go to Desi Chaat house for the samosas.  I return, sometimes an hour later, and attempt to continue the conversation as if nothing had happened.  My friends think I'm on drugs and my girlfriend is accusing me of having an affair but they don't know how much I love these samosas.\n\nBut Brad, why not introduce these people to Desi Chaat house?  \n\nThe answer is simple, hypothetical question-asker...it is because I am a man who's mind is rife with delusional paranoia.  I fear that my friends and loved ones, knowing my weakness, will buy out the samosas before I am able to get to the restaurant and they will sell them to me at ridiculous markups.  Like a hopeless addict, I will be enslaved to the wills of those I once trusted. \n\nIllogical? yes.  Impossible?  Nope.\n\n...ok back to reviewing.\n\nWhen you order them, they will offer to pour chickpeas over them.  Let them do this.  \n\nThe best way I could describe the chaat is...wacky.  It is a peculiar mix of sweet, spicy, creamy, and aromatics.  I've had the vegetable samosa and mumbai chaat and both are good.\n\nThe chicken roll and lamb roll make an excellent lunch.  The meat is tender and seasoned extremely well.  I highly recommend these items.  For a very vegetarian-leaning culture, India sure makes some excellent meat dishes.\n\nOn top of it all, the staff is ridiculously friendly and always asking for feedback on how they can improve.  It is tasty, inexpensive, unique, and has the best veggie samosas in Philadelphia.\n\nNote: I like veggie samosas a lot more than most people so bear that in mind when you consider this review.",

  "text": "\"You HAVE family in Santa Barbara that I don't know about?!\"\n\nMy husband was shocked. \n\nThat's how you keep it interesting and fresh! who says you stop discovering things about each other once you're married? ;-)\n\nTo be honest, I've been a bad cousin. No matter how many times we've gone down to SoCal, I've never really made it a point to connect with my long lost cousin. (it's been a decade!) \n\nFast forward to last weekend when he recommended Los Agaves. We arrived first with my parents and were welcomed with a very PACKED and noisy Saturday night atmosphere. It was self explanatory: fall in line, order at the counter, grab your utensils and sit yourself at a free table. We needed assistance since there were 6 of us.\n\nWe only waited a short while until they showed up and it was quite the reunion! We kept ourselves busy while waiting for our food, stuffing our faces with the fresh made chips and varieties of salsa. You're a spice wuss? good luck. Even the most \"mild\" salsa has a pretty good kick to it. I'm def a wuss (wah, wah) but the green avocado salsa was thick and had a nice flavor to it, that I couldn't stop at just one chip!\n\nSoon after, the real party came: massive steak burrito mojado ($10.95), several tacos del mar ($13.50) and grilled chicken fajitas ($16.25). I really loved the sweet mangoes that topped my fish tacos and that chipotle sauce worked its magic! All plates come with a nice heaping of Mexican rice and side salad. My mom and husband enjoyed their margaritas, but declared that the blood orange margarita had a better taste than the regular one. I was just jealous, since I couldn't partake because of lent :(\n\nLos Agaves gave us a pleasant experience and definitely lived up to its reputation as an upscale Mexican restaurant. I love the generous portions too! I'm curious to try one of their Molcajetes next time I'm in Santa Barbara and I wouldn't let another 10 years pass by before I see my cousin again.",

  "text": "Overall I really like this Whole Foods Market. It is not as large as some of their other stores, such as the amazing mega WFM in Oxnard, but also not as tiny as the store in Hillcrest for my SD friends out there. \n\nI love going to the Buzz Hive, an intimate bar with great beer and wine selections, food made to order and large TVs that play most of the popular sporting events. \n\nWhole Foods is one of my go to markets for vitamin & herbal supplements and natural, organic beauty products. For my curly-haired guys and gals, they carry the incomparable, Kinky Curly line of hair products that will make even the tightest and most unruly of curls look defined, soft and amazing. \n\nI also enjoy ordering fish from the Seafood Dept and having them prepare it for me on my lunch or dinner breaks. They have some wonderful seasoning options. I recommend Tilapia (Blackened) and Shrimp (Grilled w/ Garlic Butter), mmm! On Fridays, fresh Oysters are only a $1 per piece and they'll shuck them for you. I love to order a dozen and take them over to the Buzz Hive to enjoy with a glass of white wine. \n\nThe cheese shop is incredible. So many great frommages to choose from. Don't be shy about asking the staff for recommendations and/or samples. They are pros and generally are happy to oblige. Here's a pro tip: Look for the little basket in the cheese section for the ends and pieces of cheese. You can find some fabulous high end cheeses at perfect portions for one or two people that are very reasonably priced. I like to buy a few and take them on a picnic or to the Buzz Hive to enjoy with a big, bold red. \n\nI could go on and on but I don't want to spoil the fun of you discovering all the cool things about this location. \n\nWhy not four stars? Sometimes customer service can be a miss. There have been less than cordial staff at the juice bar and in the meat dept, who strangely I haven't seen working there in a while so perhaps the problem has resolved itself, who really put a damper on the shopping experience. Also, I have heard that Whole Foods has a stellar return policy, however, the one time that I sought to use it to seek an exchange and/or refund for being given an entirely different pizza than we ordered with an ingredient that I am allergic to (Hubs didn't check the inside of the box before he got home. We called and the pizza dept said to let the manager know the next time that we were there) - we did and the manager at the front desk refused to honor it. Bummer. We've never ordered pizza from WF since and that was over two years ago. \n\nOther than that, it's a great market and we shop there regularly. If anyone at corporate is reading, a second location on the Eastside would thrive! With customers coming from Montecito, the Riviera, Downtown, the Funk Zone and the Eastside - I think it would be a hit! Check out the space where Fresh Market used to be on Milpas Street.",

It's not often that you find a place where you can play ping pong and shuffleboard is usually tucked in the back of a dimly lit dive bar somewhere (not that there's anything wrong with that). So props for the concept of having both under one roof with good beer and food to boot!  \n\nI'm a fan of Conshohoken beer and like that they have a variety of styles to choose from. On my most recent visit, they were out of quite a few beers due to the Blob fest event happening in town; but I was still able to grab a nice tasting IPA while I got some action in on the ping pong table. \n\nI've had food from here a handful of times now - with my last order being buffalo wings - they were good but tasted like they could've been frozen and reminded me of wings I'd have at Buffalo Wild Wings. Not terrible but not great  either. \n\nI'd absolutely come back again for the beer and balls of fury but will save my appetite for one of the other local jawns in town.",

  "text": "After many years of fanboying over their late night fried chicken, it seems that life has been good for the Brothers biz. Their influence has resulted in rapid expansion, ballooning up to over 30 additional locations all throughout Louisiana at the time of this review. Since you never forget your first (#1), this location will forever hold a special place in my glutton heart.\n\nObviously a lot has changed over the years. The place is most definitely cleaner and brighter than it's ever been. To some degree, the food has been refined, resulting in crispier chicken and meat pies have nearly become just as popular. There was a time when the chicken inventory was slim pickins in the wee hours, but now it's plentiful throughout the entire day / night.\n\nWith success comes higher prices (#2), but compared to similar spots, Brothers is still quite affordable. A 25 piece will run one about $22 and the associates here do a good job of picking out potentially juicy ones. I always recommend a good mix of white and dark meat, but that's just me. Individual piece choices are always a nice thing, and the drum sticks are hard to beat.\n\nTo many more years of success, late nights, and tasty fried chicken!\n_____________\n(#1) Oh. It was so good.\n(#2) As well as a little something called *The Pandemic*",

  "text": "There are no rules on what time of day it is for eating ice cream when visiting the Reading Terminal Market, because food is what it is all about and there are no boundaries. \n\nSo after my slice of pepperoni pizza at by george, I had ice cream. You try to walk by once and stop to marvel at the sugar waffle cones being dipped into chocolate, some are then rolled into sprinkles, jimmies or nuts. \n\nBassetts has been in the same spot of the Terminal since they opened in 1893 and it still has the original marble counters.  Bassetts is the last remaining of the original tenants of the Market.\n\nRemember good old fashioned ice cream and how it used to be made with dense butterfat and rich all natural flavors? This it is and with mind blowing flavors, like champagne sorbet, where eight bottles of real champagne is used to make fifty gallons of sorbet. So I had a little drink in my sorbet, for breakfast, combined with a scoop of the apricot mango, it was delicious and refreshing. \n\nEven though you can have a dish of ice cream, I could not pass up one of those hand dipped cones, cake cones are also available. Sorbets, ice creams, sherbets, frozen yogurt in forty different flavors and most of them a highly unusual flavor. \n\nGadzooks is Bassetts decadent chocolate ice cream with pieces of peanut butter brownies, chocolate chunks and a rich caramel swirl. The also have heath bar crunch, which was my second choice, cinnamon, Irish coffee where they use Jameson Irish whiskey mixed with rich coffee, Moose Tracks which is a dark chocolate with broken peanut butter cups though out. \n\nAll totaled Bassetts has over one hundred different flavors, even though all are not available daily. They serve smoothies, chilled coffee drinks and more.  Vanilla is still their top seller and the French vanilla is still made with an egg yolk custard and vanilla beans.\n\nIf you have heard the name Bellissimo sorbets, ice creams and gelatos, Bassetts distributes it. Bassetts is in many ice cream parlors, restaurants and stores in Pa., De., NJ. and NY. I have since noticed that my local grocery store, Acme carries it, as well as Wawa, which is our local convenience store. \n\nThis is the oldest ice cream maker in America folks and started by a Quaker teacher and farmer in his back yard in New Jersey. He made the ice cream with a mule turned churn, in 1861. \n\nIn 1935 10 quarts of ice cream, packed in dry ice, was shipped via freighter from New York through the Panama Canal to the American Embassy in Tokyo. The voyage took several weeks, but the ice cream arrived in perfect condition. Bassetts Ice Cream is now available in China and being distributed to parlors, restaurants and stores. \n\nIn 1959 50 tubs of borscht sherbet was made exclusively for and shipped to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. \n\nFive generations later, this family owned business is growing strong and still serving some of the richest, creamiest ice cream you will ever enjoy. \n\nSo after our final big feast and gathering, everyone else in my group was ready for ice cream. I looked at the lines, giggled and said you go right ahead, I'll be sitting outside at one of the little cafe tables, listening to the music of the bongos and watching the crowds go by. I'm sure glad that I had my ice cream for breakfast.",

  "text": "The wine? Good. The tasting room? Chaotic and small with the feel of my grandmothers home.\n\nSaturday busy with kids and dogs running amuck. The dogs I can handle but the kids were throwing corks, playing between the bar our legs and making more noise than the bachelorettes. Cute and quirky little place that looks as if it was put together with stuff from my garage. The music is a iTouch playing Pandora (nothing wrong with any of that) and played through a Bose SoundDock. The place is very noisy so maybe the music does not matter but it looks cheap and lowbrow. A lounge are with love seat and chair is the only sitting area with some high tops and the bar to stand around. It's cramped in here. There is a private tasting room with large, dining room table but it was closed off. Would be great to have a sofa in there too for overflow and there were less than 20 of us in there.\n\nThe wine is worth trying. I enjoyed the Pinot only, Purist Flight for $15. After the kids (and parents hopefully) were sent to bed and I could hear myself think, I asked the two staffers behind the bar, \"What makes Drake special?\" and \"Why should I like it?\". With so many Santa Barbara County wines to taste in the Funk Zone, I wanted to know more about Drake. The extremely friendly and knowledgeable explained the wine maker, Mark, had worked on some large Pinot projects for other, area companies and that this was a family company with a love of wine. Their story went on and made me fell like I was part of something different. This little winery produces some good stuff. \n\nWhile the wine definitely deserve a repet visit, I'll hold off all week until Fried Chicken and Waffles with Pinot Fridays. Yep. Apparently it's a real thing on the first and third Fridays through the summer and I'll be back to eat my fill. And for that, the review of the tasting room bumped up a notch.\n\nThe wine is good but I'm not a huge fan of the room. Perhaps it will grow on me. Just keep your kids at home please.\nCheers Drake",

By the way it's 5-7 pm.\n\nSo the deal is half priced drinks and half priced appetizers.  Sounds kind of normal so far but it's absolutely not.  We're not talking well drinks here we are talking everything.  Feel free to have a premium martini at half price.  Want a glass of very nice wine; half price.  Ditto for the appetizers.  Everything is beautifully presented and delicious.\n\nThe other aspect of this Happy Hour that's great are the bartenders.  Kudos to the management for hiring some amazing people.   The icing on the cake is the bar itself.  It's beautiful and comfortable.\n\nThis Happy Hour is not new.  It's been around for many years and plenty of folks \"in the know\" on the mainline are tuned into it.  A quick note to folks not from the area.  If you are on Route 476 (Blue Route), it's less than two minutes off the Radnor/Route 30 exit.",

  "text": "Bubbletopia. Pickings are slim when it comes to finding a quality bubble tea in town. If you haven't been before, Bubbletopia is located on the second floor (take the elevator or stairs up) and has a laid back, relaxed atmosphere to it. They have a few board games that you can play (not a very good selection unless you like Jenga, Chinese chess, cards, etc.).\n\nThey have some snack options as food but I've yet to order anything besides bubble tea. Just BBT me up. The bubble tea options are endless: special mixes, milk tea, fresh fruit, powdered, green/black tea, milkshakes and juice. For the most part, I try to keep things simple and order fresh fruit.\n\n- Fresh fruit avocado ($5.75) - finding a fresh avocado bubble tea in Edmonton is like finding a diamond in the rough. I decided to try Bubbletopia's version and sadly, it was only so-so. I subbed in grass jelly, which they were nice enough not to charge me for ($0.75 extra normally). It's hard to find fresh, quality avocados in town which is what I blame the slightly off/weird taste to. The taste did gradually get better, the more it mingled. Guess that's why most people stick with the typical flavours.\n- Booboo ($5.50) and Fresh prince ($5.50) -the booboo is a blend of watermelon and strawberry with apple jelly pieces. The watermelon is more watery in general but I thoroughly enjoyed it. They could threw in more apple pieces. My friend ordered the Fresh prince and subbed out lychee pieces for sago. Her drink was much more slushy than mine. The sago was surprisingly decent. I believe they make them fresh everyday.\n- Matcha green tea milkshake ($5.75) and Spirit bomb ($5.50) - really enjoyed the matcha green tea. Perfect consistency and just the right amount of green tea flavour. Might be my new favourite! The Spirit bomb, pineapple and mango slush was also on point.\n\nThis place is growing on me. Whenever I'm northside, this is the first place that pops into my mind when I want a bubble tea to drink. When you order your drinks to stay and hang out, the BBT comes in tall glasses. Cool stuff. They are open till midnight Friday and Saturday night, hopefully they start changing this to every night!",

The bar was full of people, and so was the restaurant! Our group took up a longer table in the main dining area, and I have to say, our server was wonderful. So clearly happy with her job, which was refreshing to see. She took us through the specials, got our drinks out, and just did an outstanding job the entire night. \n\nI started with the dolma (grape leaves stuffed with lamb and beef, topped with a cream sauce) and they were really great. Very hearty, too, so maybe get some to share. For my entree I had the chicken piccata, and it was filling and flavorful. The vegetables on the side were a great touch, and I was too full to finish everything. Buuuuut apparently not too full for dessert... the cheesecake with raspberry sauce is divine.\n\nI would absolutely come here again if I was in the area. Great service, wonderful food, and excellent service. Spiro's knows how to do it right!",

Our group didn't ordered when we were supposed to because we were waiting on 2 other people. But we eventually got to order, and we waited, and waited, and waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive! The waitress kept us in the dark, she didn't tell us why our damn food was taking so long, but like 5 minutes before our food finally came out, she \"apologized\" for the delay because they were short staffed. Umm, you couldn't tell us that like 30 minutes ago! That way we know what's going on?! BAADD SERVICE but I guess at least she apologized? I don't know because I went in to get some bread/pastries, I didn't want to order from our table, hell no was she getting more tip then she deserved. The cashier had pretty horrible service too. She was slow, and when I got up to the line, she said \"one second i'll be back\" and briefly left for a minute. I was like \"WTF?!\" Okay, horrible service...I was angry and hungry.\n\nThen our food finally came out, I think they served everyone who sat in the restaurant first, and then the front patio, THEN the back patio (where we sat). I was soo pissed, but I finally got my food, I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. I was so pissed but then I tasted the food and I swallowed...it was DELICIOUS, my mood was totally changed right after, I wasn't pissed anymore, I was so delighted with the way it tasted, and how great the food was. The salmon was really tender and just right, the eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked, and the bread under was a lightly sweet, buttered bread. it all went well, it was really good and that's the only reason this place got 4 stars, if it weren't for the food, it would gotten a 2 or 3. \n\nDefinitely would come back, but now I know this place have horrible service, but great food.

Paints, beads, markers, crayons, and clay are just a few things you can get here.  What I really like about this store is, if you have a kid, you could take them in here and let them pick out a fun activity for them to do.  They sell things that you can paint and decorate, like wooden cutouts.  They have coloring books and crafts of all types.  If you get a child started with this kind of thing early, they will be creative for life.  It's also a good idea to pick up colors and crafts for a kids party or rainy days when a child needs something to do.\n\nMichael's also carries frames and things like that.

  "text": "Health Mutt is a very awesome, neighborhood pet store featuring all natural pet treats and foods, along with some terrific pet toys, accessories, and grooming services for the Fido's and Fluffy's in your life. \n\nI am a huge lover of four-legged pets, but unfortunately I lost my favorite feline to degenerative kidney failure a while back. With my crazy travel and work schedule it's not fair for me to take on the responsibility of saving a new shelter pet, but then constantly be putting my little buddy into the kennel when I'm on the road. Instead I depend upon the generosity of my business partner to let me sit on the floor and play with his two dogs whenever we work from his house.\n\nSIDE BAR COMMENT:  I recently purchased a Seminole Heights Unites \"Fires Die - Community Lives\" t-shirt to support the employees of Domani Bistro and A Modern Line furniture store, following the devastating fire which destroyed the restaurant and damaged the furniture store next door. 100% of the proceeds, after the raw cost of the garment, are donated to the employees, so this is a really good cause -- http://heightsunites.bigcartel.com/product/fires-die-community-lives-t-shirt. Earlier this week I received an email saying that the t-shirts were ready for pickup at Health Mutt in Seminole Heights. Turns out that the owner of the pet store is a big supporter of Seminole Heights' businesses, and was instrumental in creating the local team to support these two businesses and their staffs. Very cool!!!\n\nOK, BACK TO OUR STORY:  Health Mutt sits just a few blocks east of Florida Avenue at the intersection of Hanna and Central Avenues, right in the heart of Seminole Heights. I parked out front, and wandered into the store to take a look around. My plan was to pick up my t-shirt, and also find some doggie treats for my business partner's two dogs, Izzi and Belle.\n\nBill likes to say that Izzi and Belle are sisters from different mothers since Izzi is a pomeranian, and Belle is a black Lab, but their personalities are like twin sisters. I'm often showered with dog love and affection the moment that I walk in his front door, and I have to play with them and give them treats before they let Bill and I get down to work.\n\nCharlie from Health Mutt was a huge help in navigating my way through the myriad of dog treat options, and I ended up buying a box of all-natural Cloud Star \"Wag more bark less\" baked applewood-smoked bacon dog treats which will keep me on the good side of Izzi and Belle for the next few weeks. I also picked up some appropriately-sized Barkworthies Bully stick chew thingies which are much better than those nasty ol' rawhide chews.\n\nWhile Charlie was getting my t-shirt from the back room, I had the chance to watch one of the staff bathing and grooming a few dogs, and was very impressed by her attention to the dogs and her gentle demeanor. \n\nThe store is packed with healthy and great quality food and treats, and there were all sorts of toys, collars, harnesses, leashes, and bedding just waiting for you to take home. Super friendly people, and you can tell that they really enjoy working with pets and their owners. Great little find in the middle of Seminole Heights.",

This is one of the most important restaurants that serve up great New Orleans cuisine at it's finest. \n\nThe wood-fired oysters are a must. The chili garlic butter is out of this world. These oysters are charred to perfection and have the smokey taste from the process being grilled. The garlic butter is melted throughout the oyster and is addicting!! I swear I can just pour all that butter into all my seafood platters and it'll do the job.\n\nThe alligator bites were amazing too! These were the best gator bites I've had in N.O. The texture is much tender and is fried to perfection and not that mushy breaded texture. This is crispy and golden. The dipping sauce of the chili garlic goes great too! So make sure you get two things here: Wood-fired oysters & gator bites!",

You wouldn't know it from the outside, but when you walk in you are immediately impressed by the warm decor. \n\nYou walk straight into their beautiful wine store. They also have cheeses & meats which the manager explained can be made into a charcuterie board... YUM!\n\nOnce you walk through the store they have a HUGE patio area. Upstairs is the coolest bar! This is where we chose to spend our time. The bartender was AWESOME! She explained different drinks as well as specials, food, and local info. My husband had a gin fizz which he had never had before. He loved it!\n\nThey have weekly specials as well as entertainment. I would highly suggest a visit while visiting NOLA. I'm sure glad we did!",

Yes, it was a lot colder in Nashville than I thought it would be and I only packed t-shirts and yes I was freezing on Music Row but why not get in some ice cream, especially when it's cold? It's my version of joining the polar bear club.\n\nThe inside looks like an old school soda shop which is nice. I always wanted to see what one looked like and Mike's fits the bill, even the soda jerk mural on the wall.\n\nDecor only goes so far though, if you come to a place that says it is an ice cream fountain you better have the goods to back it up. I got the pistachio and peanut butter in a cone. My friend for nutter butter and the raspberry cheesecake. My peanut butter scoop was a little too thick, it was really like frozen peanut butter, delicious but really heavy. However, my pistachio was dead on though I thought it was flavorful but still light.\n\nI tried the butter butter and it was what I was looking for in the peanut butter flavor. After reading the reviews and finding it's one of their homemade flavors I know why it was so good. The raspberry cheesecake also stood out and was jealous of the choice she made.\n\nI would normally award three stars but something stuck out to me during my visit, at the front of the store was a gentleman who obviously hadn't bought anything in a while and was disheveled looking. It was cold out and the staff and owners had it in their hearts to let this man stay out of the cold and warm up as long as their doors were open, that should stand for something.",

Everything started off fine. The space itself is bright and attractive and the friendly staff greets you right away. My first course of Fried Quail (kruche chean) was very tasty - especially with the fresh lime.  The main course though wasn't very impressive to me at all.  That was the well-known Cambodian dish - Prahok Ktis.  I found it on the bland side with little taste of spice.  And the dipping vegetables were okay but I like more variety.  I did improvise by changing it into a rice dish and used the various condiments provided on the table to jazz it up .... but of course in Phnom Penh they don't eat it this way. If I eat here again I will def opt for a different main course ... but I prob will first go to another Cambodian restaurant up the street from I Heart Cambodia which I really like even more.",

  "text": "La Familiga has been in operation since 1976. That's 40 years from 2016, math majors. Let me start by tipping my figurative hat to such success in a tough restaurant industry. \n\nTheir 40th anniversary rollback menu and pricing was actually what drew me in for my recent visit. I had recalled enjoying my experience about a decade ago, but this restaurant is far from hip and trendy and has likely missed its way back on to my very deep \"to-eat\" list.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a traditionally, upscale experience. The main dining room has a nostalgic antique feel. In all honesty, so did a lot of the other clientele. I say this not as a slight but as an observation. During the course of our meal, my husband and I were discussing how odd it is that an establishment of such stature only has 87 (now 88) reviews on Yelp. The older, more classically dignified demographic may be a factor. \n\nThe other reason for their staying power is that the food is damn good. Nothing else will keep you afloat like an exemplarily meal. \n\nGoing off of other Yelper's recommendations, we started by picking a bottle of wine from the holy bible of vino. We ended up with a lovely Chianti that paired perfectly with our dinner. \n\nAs millennials, we went a non-traditional approach in ordering and started with pasta dishes instead of salads. As others had mentioned the pesto gnocchi is excellent but different. I believe the difference is the potato and ricotta blend that causes the texture to be a little lighter. The pesto sauce was creamy but did not drown the dumpling blend. My husband's penne arribata was simple but exemplified what the dish should be. A little kick, some chunks of tomato and a top of fresh basil.\n\nWe decided to split two entrees: the Vitello Papa Sena (veal of the picante, mandolese and capri variety) and the Filetto all Familiga. I haven't had such tender veal cutlets in a while. Each sauce was different yet complimentary of each other. The white wine sauce paired with prosciutto and mozzarella for the mandolese was ultimately my favorite. Although the butter in picante and white wine with spinach and pepper topped with mozzarella of the capri were certainly enjoyable.  The Filetto was prepared in a wine sauce but more in a gravy styling. It put a nice Italian touch on a classic cut of steak. Of course, it was prepared to the temperature of our liking and completely on point.\n\nExpecting a traditional dessert menu, we were a little surprised when a tray of three options (that we've had previously never heard of) were presented to us. The Zuppa Inglese (an Italian dessert layering custard and sponge cake...thanks, Wiki) was the most intriguing. Consisting of a rum soaked cake with a light, fluffy yet crisp meringue-like topping, it hit the spot with a little post-dinner sweetness.\n\nFor this particular experience, the portions seemed to match the 1976 pricing, which is not necessarily a bad thing as I walked away content versus crammed. Perhaps if we ate like it was 1976, American waists would be more in line with a healthy standard, but I digress. \n\nWhile there are a million and one new restaurants in Philadelphia that are far more trendy than La Familiga, this is the spot to go if you are looking for an upscale Italian dining experience.\n\nWriter's note: after initially submitting this a 4 star review, I can't honestly give a reason that it shouldn't be a 5 star review. I don't typically give 5s out for infrequent visits or promotional menus, however there is absolutely no reason a star should be deducted due to my personal Yelp \"rules.\"",

The sauce for the chow fun is rich and savor without being greasy in the slightest, which I really liked.  The crispy fried quail was flavorful with well-marinated meat and the lemongrass beef skewers were juicy and savory.  I'm not an expert on Cambodian cuisine authenticity but I am a huge fan of the banh cao here, which is a crepe stuffed with pork and veggies, and dipped into fish sauce.  It's definitely a must-try and the portion is huge!  The Khmer fish amok is another dish to get here: spicy, creamy, and tender pieces of marinated fish in a savory and indulgent coconut broth; it's basically a Cambodian curry and it is soooo delish!  We have yet to dine in but I always end up sopping up the last of the broth with a baguette from Ben City or mixing it with jasmine rice or lunch the next day.  Just try it.  Anyhow, the staff here are sweet and our food, perfectly packed with utensils, is always ready and waiting to be picked up after our shopping trip next door.  Definitely worth visiting next time you're grocery-shopping at Ben City.",

  "text": "This is probably the most affordable place to eat among all the new places that have opened on Freret St. and they have been there longer than most of the others.  They have many tasty options that are all very reasonably priced.  The only slight complaint I have about this place is along with the free chips you get some \"queso\" that tastes like the velveta cheese you get on Superdome nachos more than any real queso I've had (so they might do better just switching to salsa but it is free so you can't complain too much).  They also were having a half price drink special the last night I ate there so that was a GREAT deal for a Friday night.  \n\nTheir tacos are all around $3, depending on the meat selection, and you then get to add additional toppings of your choice.  At my last dinner I selected a chicken taco, shrimp taco, and fish taco (they use flounder for their fish tacos) and I was quite satisfied with the portion size (with the chicken being exceptionally generous on the toppings).  They also offer \"bowls\" of various combinations of taco ingredients sans tortillas and then a few additional entrees with the most enticing to me being a steak.  This is certainly not the best Mexican type food I've had (and I'm not the biggest fan of this type of food) but I would definitely go here before Superior Grill, Nacho Mama's, Taqueria Corona, Maya's, Baru, Rum House, or Felipe's.  Overall a fantastic value for some good simple food with some great drink specials.",

Their other locations are a bit more tricky with parking and the area they are in  but this one in West Nashville/Sylvan Park is perfect. I took two out of town visitors here for some food and their Tuesday night trivia. It was definitely a good spot to take people who are visiting and requesting to try barbecue. \n\nI ordered their special of the day which was a rib sandwich with fried pickles and cole slaw. I hope this is the special every single time I return because it was phenomenal. As with their other sandwich specials it comes with a choice of two sides, so I ordered the potato salad and green beans. Both of these sides are very tasty although I was eyeing the cornbread from my friend's plate. The food came out within 15-20 minutes of us ordering which was not too bad of a wait. \n\nWe ate outside on their patio, which is oh so pleasant on a warm evening. We did have to find someone to clean our table off but they took care of that quickly. If you plan to do trivia you can still hear everything very clearly over the speakers even if you are seated outside. Their patio is also very doggo friendly, so we got to pet many pups sitting out there. \n\nAlthough we came in 7th place for trivia (boo!) I would rate Edley's #1 for barbecue in Nashville. We had a great time at this location and I will definitely be coming back.",

The bread was fluffy and hot, and the meat, lettuce, tomato and mayo had a consistent and even ratio. I personally like to shove jalapeno chips to my sandwiches to add a crunchy texture to my sandwiches and Jimmy John's kettle cooked chips make a perfect addition.

  "text": "Rippy's marries 2 long bars, 2 live stages, and Barbecue without any major dysfunction. \n\nDowntown Nashville is an fantastic place for live music, but surprisingly there aren't just too many barbecue joints to pick from. Jack's has a prominent place on Broadway across the street but I left a bit appointed so I decided to dial up Rippy's a few days later to see if I couldn't find a winning 'Cue. More a concert venue than just a straight up barbecue house, Rippy's is big enough that there are actually multiple sections with separate live bands. The walls must be pretty well insulated, because I couldn't even hear the other band from my side of the restaurant. The crowd is rather wild and loud - if not just bone ass wasted - but the service was still excellent. \n\nI opted for the 1/2 Chicken Barbecue plate and what came from the kitchen was more than I bargained for as it flaunted the mentioned 1/2 Chicken that is seasoned and then slow smoked. The meat had a great smoke level, which matched perfectly with the evident smoke ring yet remained moist and juicy especially in the dark meat areas. The Curly Fries were standard issue and a bit overly salted but that did little to keep me from nibbling on them every few bites. The Chili on the other hand was flat and contained Beans - a pet peeve of mine. I would skip the Chili altogether on the next go around. \n\nNaturally the party atmosphere is what most patrons come to Rippy's for but the food isn't a slouch when you weigh in the nearby options of the genre and while Rippy's wasn't the best barbecue I've ever had, but it was certainly passable. I'd go back for the drinks and music any day, although I'd likely order a Burger instead.",

  "text": "Came here about 12:15pm on a Friday.  It was not very busy. The place has about 10 tables and some counter seating. 4 other tables were occupied. They also have a few outdoor tables. \n\nThe waitress told us to choose a table and brought us menus. There are several salad options, various sandwiches and soups. The soup of the day was broccoli cheddar today. \n\nMy wife chose the southwestern salad and I chose the southern melt. My wife really enjoyed the iced tea!!! The restaurant has a cool feel and is part of the West street market. \n\nOur food was delivered in a timely fashion and everything tasted delicious. \n\nOne downside is the acoustics. We noticed it was difficult to hear each other but we could hear everyone else's conversations. Next time we will sit outside.\n\nOverall, a great experience. We will be back.",

  "text": "3.5 Stars...here's why:\n\nI spent an entire afternoon strolling up and down Talbot Street, and I was impressed by the artists who were there as well as the variety of mediums that were for sale.  I bought art and also had henna done on my hands, which I thought was pretty cool too.  I had a lovely afternoon at the Talbot Street Art Fair.  However, I do have two critiques:\n\n(01) Prior to coming, I checked their website to see if pets were allowed, but I saw nothing.  I brought my dachshund in tow, but when we arrived, there was a wishy-washy sign that discouraged you from bringing your dog, yet I saw people with their dogs all around.  I was confused: why no definite answer?  Now, my puppy did no harm at the art fair, and I didn't feel as if her presence was a big deal for the fair-goers.  In fact, many people asked to pet her, and one of the artisans even held her while I chose and purchased a piece from him.  Still, I think the organizers should make up their mind about this specific issue in order to prevent confusion.\n\n(02) Nicey Treat was there, which was awesome and refreshing on a warm, sunny day, but why not bring in some more food trucks?  It's not like Indianapolis has a shortage of them!  With an art fair that is so anticipated and popular, I would have loved to see more than Pineapple Delight and popcorn. Save that for the State Fair.  Besides, food is art.  Showcase it with some tasty stuff!\n\nWill I come back next year?  Yes.  Will I bring my Dachshund? Most likely, if the organizers can make up their minds.",

Unfortunately I came here in the evening and was not able to take in the beautiful views but my experience was still amazing.  They were near closing so it was not very busy.  We had the shop to ourselves for most of the visit.   My party of 4 tried 3 Signature Tasting: 2 whites and 3 reds, and 1 White Tasting: 4 whites.  \n\nThe owner of the shop was very knowledgeable of his wines and the wine making process.  Before the evening was over well all had a better understanding and appreciation of wine.   If you are interested in joining a wine club you should check out this spot. \n\nThe atmosphere was relaxing and laid back (the wine may have had something to do with this), they provided great customer service and I would love to go back during the day to try more wine and take in the view.",

I would have liked it deconstructed like she had it in Trinity, but I'll ask for it that way next time.\n\nWe also tried their Brussel sprouts with bacon which was excellent.

There was about a ten minute wait that flew by as we enjoyed the scene. If you didn't already figure it out, Molly's has one of the best patios around.\n\nFor brunch I ordered their egg sandwich and home fries. It was only like $8-9 and amazing. Seriously, I could eat it every morning. Egg sandwiches are one of my top favorite things to eat for breakfast and they NAILED IT. It had fresh slices of tomato and juicy bacon slices. Pairs well with their mimosa but what doesn't?!\n\nWe even go to enjoy some live music during the meal. Not many places have live music during a Sunday brunch!

And got a fruit cup.\n\nMore than four omelette additions cost 50 cents each, with plenty of additions available.\n\nAnd there are premium additions: smoked salmon and lump jumbo crab for $2.50 each.\n\nThis was a lovely meal, and we got a chance to catch up, without any pressure to leave.\n\nShe liked her pancakes.\n\nMy omelette was PERFECT! The roasted red peppers and caramelized onions were such tasty additions. And the turkey sausage was small pieces scattered about -- which gave me a piece of turkey sausage in every bite. Great composition. And the eggs were beautifully done.\n\nMy fruit cup was ridiculously fresh: blackberry, raspberry, kiwi, grape, honeydew and pineapple. What a glorious mix of fresh fruits.\n\nI took home half of my omelette and half of my fruit cup, which served well as lunch the next day.",

The main dining area quickly filled up with regulars at dinner and the staff was terrific. The bar is comfortable for drinks, appetizers or even dinner. \n\nWe had the pleasure of Sean Baker entertaining us on the piano and several regulars taking center stage throughout the evening.  When the pianist asked for request I prompted my husband to ask for his all time favorite Charlie Brown music. Most don't take the request seriously or don't know the songs but Sean did. He played several to the pleasure of my husband and the crowd. Perfect birthday treat for him and icing on the cake. \n\nThe bacon horseradish dip was tasty with the horseradish not overpowering the bacon flavor. Served with a large basket of ripple potato chips and re-heats well for leftovers. My Hot Pot was excellent and I'll be ordering again in the future. One of the dinner specials was a Beef Manhattan with soup and dessert. Again, one of birthday boys favorite being an old fashion meat and potato guy. Plenty of tender beef accompanied by an extra large serving of mashed potatoes. The high light of dinner for me was the delicate and fluffy coconut cream pie. So much so I'm ordering a birthday pie this Friday for my sister in law. Delicious, light pie with a flaky crust perfect after a large meal or by itself.\n \nExcellent service, terrific food, fun, warm atmosphere, nice mixture of ages and personalities.

  "text": "Ban Thai. Holy jeebus, I'm pretty sure I've passed this little Thai restaurant more times than I care to count. I've always noticed the sign driving by but stopping for a bite to eat never crossed my mind until now. I guess it's because when you live in the area, you take things for granted. That or you just stay at home to cook. At least that's my train of thought.\n\nA buddy and I decided to check Ban Thai out on a Tuesday evening. We arrived at 6:30pm and the place was pretty empty. There were two other groups of five that came later while we were eating but for the most part, it wasn't too busy. That's probably good because our server, leaning towards the ancient side of things (but super nice), was a tad on the slow side. No biggie though as the slow pace goes with the relaxed vibe and interesting, eclectic décor. The walls are plastered with Thai paintings and man, the menus sure are old.\n\nSpeaking of the menus, they had a couple \"suggested combinations\" but I'm not sure why you'd order that when you can go a la carte style and the price comes out pretty much equal. Combos are supposed to be deals no?!?! They probably should take a page out of Million Thai's playbook.\n\n- Po Taek (#12) ($10.00) - spicy sour mixed seafood soup with tomatoes and mushrooms. The lemongrass was prominent and gave it a nice sourness to the broth. I didn't find it too spicy but there was some heat to it. Couple pieces of shrimp, squid and mussels were mixed in. Great way to start our meal.\n- Gaeng kiew waan (#54) ($12.50) - creamy, green coconut curry with fresh basil, red and green peppers, snow peas and for meat, we picked chicken. We were both surprised by how dark the green curry looked like when it came out. It also had an interesting aroma - smelled something along the lines of mild coffee? Maybe we were losing our minds. Or it was the lighting. Definitely blame the lighting. It didn't matter though because the green curry was spot on. Rich and creamy in a subtle way.\n- Kao mun (#27) ($4.00) - Thai rice steamed in coconut milk, aka. coconut rice. It says serves 2-3 people, but it's more to 2 people. We probably could have ordered another bowl, as we ran out of rice to finish off the green curry. It was good though, fluffy and the coconut came through loud and clear.\n- Padt Thai (#33) ($15.00) - the padt thai is their house specialty (according to the menu). Thin rice noodles fried soft with minced pork, baby shrimp, tofu, chives, egg, bean sprouts and topped with crushed roasted peanuts. We were impressed by how generous the portion was. It's always a struggle finding a place that does this dish justice but they had the perfect balance of sweetness in their sauce.\n\nBan Thai is a sweet, sort-of-not-really hidden gem on the west end. Nice to see there are a few, emphasis on few, good spot on the West end for some good eats! Another Thai place in town to add to the list. I'll be back to try a few more things now that I know they do the basics well.",

  "text": "My feelings about my experiences with Daleng are very mixed. I'm willing to chalk that up to the fact that I've only done takeout, while most of the reviews and photos (which heightened my expectations) were based on eat-in experiences. \n\nThe pros: highly flavored, completely delicious on both entrees that I've tried, specifically the Eggplant and Veggie Curry and the Cambodian Stir Fry with Tofu. The sauce on the eggplant and veggie curry is so good that I could just pour that on a plate of brown rice and happily call it a meal. The tofu in the Cambodian Stir Fry is well prepared, there's lots of lemongrass, which I love, and the the vegetables in both are so thoroughly cooked that every bite is a melt-in-your-mouth party of tender vegetables, flavorful sauce and fluffy rice.\nThe service is friendly and quick, and for eat-in it looks like they have a good drink selection with really good prices. So I definitely want to have an eat-in experience here.\n\nThe not-so-pros: In spite of other reviews claiming the contrary here, the portion sizes are not really that generous. I feel like for the price, the portions might have been what you would expect for a lunch portion from a restaurant that was less \"takeout-esque\" (borrowing Karen X's brilliant wordplay there) than Daleng. They don't really pack the takeout containers, which is understandable because there's A LOT of sauce and it was spilling out even from the 3/4 filled containers. The amount of rice was a little harder to forgive though; the cup-sized cartons were only partially filled to the top, and there were gaps at the bottom of the container (so not even packed in). Again, probably not a problem if you were to do an eat-in meal, but not great for what I'd expect from a takeout carton of rice. When similar sized takeout containers from most places provide enough for two generous meals for me, and from here the containers provide about half of that, I can't help noticing.\n \nAll that said, I will almost definitely still be doing both takeout and eat-in here. My husband tried the vegetarian banh mi and was underwhelmed, so maybe I'll just stick to their stir fries (and gotta try the spring rolls too). That eggplant and vegetable curry will definitely be a permanent favorite.",

How much my treadmill loves you for all the action it's getting.\n\nSeriously, Whisk is everything I love in a local bakery.\n\nThe staff is so sweet. I was stalking out some pumpkin snickerdoodles they posted a photo of on Facebook, and when I called and found out they were gone, I was sad. That's until the owner told me she'd pop some in the oven for me. They were out of this world.\n\nThe look of this place is so charming, comforting, colorful, and is such a great addition to Cherokee street. I can see myself spending some time working here with baked goodies and some local coffee (the only thing missing is wifi!)\n\nSwing by when you can, seriously. I haven't had something I didn't like here. Vegans, there are options for you as well.\n\nThanks for just existing, Whisk!",

I also had seen this as a new place listed earlier in the day by the Yelp team on FB so, I thought I would splurge and get a meal that wasn't quite on my diet.\n\nI ordered up the Rustler sandwich with no cheese ... and it was delicious. On first blush I think this could easily be one of the best sandwiches served in Reno.  The design is a bit more messy than other places with the bread on top.  But still the stuff they put on the sandwich was an explosion of flavor.\n\nI also got the mac salad because I am a sucker for a new mac salad.  It was pretty good.  As was the cookie that really made the meal a complete splurge.\n\nThe quick-serve style is like any other small sandwich shop.  I am not sure the location is the best for what they are doing, but if people like the food as much as I did, they will be packing in the people.",

  "text": "There is no better lunch option on a Friday than the Assumption Greek Orthodox Church Lunch.  Homemade Greek food with love.  Every Friday from 11 am- 2 pm, you can be sure to enjoy true Greek hospitality.  Drive to the very back of the parking lot and enter the white doors where you see a set of small stairs and a wheelchair ramp.  If it is your first time, there are plenty of people to point you in the right direction.\n\nThe church does an amazing job of posting their whole month's menu online.  They even have a downloadable copy for offices and groups that order together.  Take Out here is a breeze.  You can call the kitchen and place your pick up order directly or wait in line to see the options.  If you choose to eat at the location there are plenty of round tables filling the entire auditorium space.  \n\nOn my last visit, I was thrilled to order Lobster Bisque ($4.00), Spanakopitia ($3.00), Greek Salad ($5.00) and Dolmathes (2 for $3.00).  I had so much left over it made a second lunch.  Over the years, I have probably ordered almost everything.  Every Week they offer a Baked Fish option.  I have gotten the Baked Fish and served it for Dinner before.  Everything is boxed nicely and holds well.  The homemade soups never disappoint.  Once a month or so they sever Lamb Shank, expect longer lines on these days.\n\nYou do not have to wait for the once a year Greek Festival for fresh and flavorful Greek food.  Plan a visit to this West County hidden treasure soon.",

Does that mean I can give 10?\n\nFor the longest time I followed that the owner of South Philly Tap Room was going to open up a cafe that hook up delectable coffee offerings from one of my favorites, Counter Culture (http://mealticket.blogs.citypaper.net/blogs/mu/2009/05/05/first-look-at-brewultimo-coffee/). and even better was the fact that it wasn't only going to offer one of my favorite vices, it was going to offer TWO of them by doubling over as a beer store as soon as it procured a liquor license (http://ultimocoffee.wordpress.com/2009/01/23/meal-ticket-round-two-keeping-tabs-on-brewultimo-coffee/). And while one of those goals is still a work in progress, the coffee shop is very much alive and might just be one of the best in the city.\n\nas soon as I walked up one of the South Philly roads that is less traveled for me and saw my destination, I became enamored by it's outdoor seating and garage door that opened to combine the outside with the in. the incredible decor expanded with church pews and antique window fixtures hanging indoors. I also made note of the many refrigerator units that will one day hold mass quantities of delectable beer.\n\nThe iced chai that I initially order made for the perfect relaxed wake up call during a hot day. and the coffee that I ordered afterwards embodied a dark richness to it's body that was fully accentuated by the drip method that they utilize. and the lemon square that I ordered along with it was sheer perfection. \n\nOverall the staff were friendly and extremely accommodating, and the atmosphere made for the perfect environment to have our book club in. It looks like Ultimo is a place that I'll be visiting for a long while to come!",

  "text": "I'm not really a prophet of Restaurant Week or anything. I can take it or leave it. Mostly leave it, since I feel like I can have a better experience for the same price (sometimes less, sometimes more if we're all being honest here) any other night of the year. That said, I do dig RW for one thing - lunch. Because if you can score a table at one of the few gems on the list that runs like a well-oiled machine, you are all but guaranteed a fantastic meal at a price that can't be beat. Barbuzzo is one of those gems. \n\nI entered the restaurant at 12:45, my reservation time, and my lunch date and I were taken to our table right away. No waiting! If our server was unhappy to be working this shift, he certainly didn't show it. He took care of us for the duration of the meal and offered helpful suggestions when we asked for his opinion. I started with a crisp glass of white wine which went perfectly with my meal. \n\nTo start, the vegetable board, which had a piece of buttery oven-grilled bread, roasted peppers, brussels lightly scented with truffle, glazed carrots and some broccoli rabe. It wasn't rocket science but it was a healthy and satisfying start to the meal. The sheep's milk ricotta across from me was wiped clean from the plate. Next up for me was a chicken dish, with two thin cutlets topped with parmesan and a little prosciutto. This was served over some braised greens and mashed potatoes with a little bit of gravy around the bottom. It was very nice, not too heavy and packed lots of flavor. My companion had the pizza. Folks, if you haven't had Barbuzzo's pizza, get on it, because it's some of the best in the city. Last but not least, the caramel budino. I somehow managed to restrain myself to only half, which is honestly plenty for me since the flavors are so rich and sweet. \n\nSurprisingly, this was probably the quietest meal I've ever enjoyed at Barbuzzo. Everyone around us seemed to be seated on time and there were no waits at the door. I guess when a restaurant is used to having a full house on the regular, Restaurant Week is no different from any other day.",

Given the restaurant's concept, this place is as good as it gets for the paleo folks.  The front side of the menu is geared around them.  But what if you're not on Team Paleo?  What if you're vegetarian or vegan?  Good news: you have options too.  Just flip the menu around, and Nook has laid out what you can eat.\n\nI went the vegetarian/dairy-free route and ordered the Shiitake, Lemon, & Basil Cauliflower Wood Oven Pizza from the vegan menu but opted for the paleo crust (it has egg in it).  I really enjoyed the pizza, finding the highlight of the pizza was the paleo crust.  I was in disbelief of how tasty my pizza was, yet there was no food coma looming.  Feeling good, I also shared the Chocolate Avocado Mousse, topped with shredded coconut and pistachios, which turned out being another excellent choice.  Walking out sans food coma, I knew I had found the best option in Indy to eat out without consequence.\n\n(PS: big shout out to the entire staff for their attentiveness from start to finish.)",

  "text": "I can only speak about this establishment with regards to the maki rolls.\n\nA lot of Japanese places walk a fine line with their sushi. They want to preserve the humble discipline of ancient tradition while still appealing to the American sense of gluttony. This is why you see menus with a number of traditional options and then like 4 or 5 wacky maki rolls where tons of stuff are thrown in. Kabuke makes no bones about what they do - They make wacky rolls to appeal to the American who wants it all(in a roll).\n\nKabuke's special roll menu has like, 50 of these, and they look good. They pack everything from lobster to honey wasabi into their creations. Granted, a lot of these are different by way of one ingredient and some parts of the menu kinda look like this:\n\nSuper Duper Roll - Salmon, shrimp tempura, eel sauce, masago, sesame seed bun, glass, copper bullet casing.\nCrying Angel Roll - Salmon, shrimp tempura, eel sauce, masago, tuna, glass, copper bullet casing.\n(None of these are actually on the menu. Do not take these seriously)\n\n...that being said, the rolls are hefty in size, content, and quality. The spicy Mexican roll is pretty good and the Kabuke roll caught my eye for next time(It had like tuna, asparagus, shrimp tempura, caviar, sweet sauce, salted tuna, and probably other things I am forgetting). I'll be back here soon and will report on more of the wacky rolls.\n\nOn a slight negative, the regular salmon maki is a little squishy. The place still rules.\n\nFurthermore, the service is really friendly and prompt.\n\nOn the action-movie-parallel-satisfaction-scale, this place is The Terminator.",

I arrived in town late Thanksgiving night and while intrigued and somewhat excited by the multiple options on State Street that were open and serving special Thanksgiving meals I really just wanted to sink my teeth into some standard American fare like a burger or pizza. I'm always hungry for a pizza. The menu has tons of unique burger options, salads, cleaner entree options like fish, tacos, lots of interesting appetizers, tortilla wraps and a big section of pizza options. I loooooove garlic with white sauce pizzas but my man is not such a fan so typically we end up sharing marinara sauce pizzas. Since I was here sans man I went with my gut instinct, ordering the White Out Pizza and was not disappointed! Grilled chicken, mozzarella, garlic, TRUFFLE oil. Yummmmmmm. \n\nI'm still not much of a drinker anymore so I didn't sample any of the brews but some guys next to us were having a grand old time with the samplers and I saw some cool sounding beers on the menu board that I would definitely want to try if I didn't have to be careful with belly bloat before an event!\n\nService was average. Seat yourself at any table and hope that a server notices your presence. We sat a good 15 minutes before were even able to make eye contact with someone who worked there to flag them down to take our orders.",

  "text": "A beautiful hidden gem nestled in the heart of Lambertville. My husband was so proud that he \"found\" this place, and I was happy to oblige in trying something new!  \n\nWe actually walked over from the Wine Cellar at Lambertville Station, it is super walkable (~7 mins). Anyways, once we walked in, we immediately knew we found our new favorite restaurant. The smells of the food were intense and super fragrant. The restaurant is a no-frills basic room, yet intimate and charming. Copper tables dotted the space in various configuration of 2's, 4's and even a party of 6.  Antique middle eastern lights hung from the ceiling in various colors, proving just enough light to see, with tea candles flickering on each table for a pinch of romanticism.  You can see into the kitchen vaguely, and get the sense that it's only a couple people back there, doing what they do best. \n\nThe menu is surprisingly large. So many options ranging from Zatter bread & babaghannough to gyros, Koshari, and Egyptian samosas - it was hard to choose! We settled on sharing 3 things, and made a deal on what we'll order the next time we dine (gyros, hummus, and Ouzi, for the record).  \n\nTo start we ordered babaghannough, which was sublime. Their menu described it as \"eggplant dip will be the best you ever had\" and, I gotta say, it was! The \"generous dose of garlic\" definitely tickled our tastebuds, but we're complete garlic lovers so it was right up our alley. Plus, the pita was served warm, always a good touch!\n\nFor our meal, we shared a salad with shrimp and kofta. Honestly the salad was \"fine\", totally good and shrimp was flavored well, but, it got lost in comparison to the kofta, that I hardly touched it.  \n\nThe kofta; omg. First of all, the meat itself was so packed with flavor that my taste buds were practically dancing! It was served with tahini and toumeaa (a garlic sauce); both of which were unlike anything I've tasted before.  They doctored up their tahini - it was bright and flavorful, almost zesty.  The toumeaa was unreal - the words \"that's money\" from a certain flame-wearing diner-visiting chef popped into my mind. It was like a kick in the pants, for my tastebuds - SO unbelievably garlicky, yet somehow I couldn't get enough.  The dish was served with yummy long grain rice, which I happily used to shovel more toumeaa into my mouth.  Let's just say, it's a good thing we both were eating the same thing - otherwise I would have had some SERIOUS garlic breath issues (I mean, I still had it - but at least we both did!)\n\nThe server was super friendly and hospitable, prompt without being pushy, but left us alone just the right amount! I legitimately cannot wait to go back and try more of this menu!!!\n\n::Heads up, no reservations unless you have a party of 6+. You can do call ahead seating! We came around 9pm on Saturday and we're seated immediately, but the place was really full.\n:: BYOB! Wahoo!",

Once they get their website up and running, I will enjoy reading the menu on line and deciding, rather than feeling rushed in the vestibule. \n\nHubby had a coke and was handed a blue plastic cup and shown where the soda fountain was, which does allow free refills. The hostess handed us a large playing card and asked us to give it to our server, we were also asked to seat ourselves. There is only one dining area, off to the right and they are all booths, which are quite attractive for a very casual restaurant. \n\nI was most impressed with the bar and lounge area which sits directly front and center and is wide open. It is a huge horseshoe shaped bar with TV screens scattering the walls and the coolest wine bar I have ever seen in my life! Their wine list is awesome and these are from wineries around the world that can only be bought by the case. Each section has a controlled temperature and sealing to ensure freshness. You have to check it out, very sophisticated, I think this impressed me the most!\n\nSo, you place your order and pay for it before you choose your own seat, hand said server a playing card, she already knows from the hostess that I will be having a glass of wine and opens a new check and delivers. Then they have a runner, because your order was already turned into the kitchen and as it comes up, it comes out, it does not matter if you ordered a side of mac & cheese to go with your crab cakes, the mac & cheese will come out first if it is ready to run.\n\nI started with a colossal sized bleu cheese wedge and when I saw it I laughed to myself thinking of Fred Flinstone! It was a huge wedge with a large dinner fork shoved right into the top of it and a large knife to break it all down. It was not chintzy on the bleu cheese dressing or crumbles and the bacon was plentiful, alas no tomatoes and skimpy on the red onion, but they quickly brought me a few more slivers of onion... It was served on a chilled plate, very crisp, I would order this again.\n\nThe twin crab cakes said absolutely no bread fillers and I asked if they were pure lump crab meat and was told yes. The crab cakes were a bit of a disappointment, mostly shredded crab meat with a bit of lump crab mixed in, but there was no real flavor, no onions or peppers and if there was it missed my two cakes, but the whole grain mustard sauce I could have eaten with a spoon it was so good. My crab cakes came with plain steamed broccoli, which I am not a big fan of, but no substitutions of sides are permitted so I ordered a side of mac & cheese, which was in a creamy velveeta like sauce, spirals enough for two, nothing spectacular.\n\nWe are both soup lovers, but there were no soups on the menu, we did inquire and they do plan on having soups in the near future, Chow284 just opened this past Monday. \n\nHubby had a French dip which came with a side of gravy instead of au jus and a side of horseradish sauce. Layers of roast beef lined this crunchy and delicious roll and the meat was topped with Gruyere cheese, bonus points there, but he said the meat was dry and a French dip should be served with au jus, not gravy. Ah change again, I need to open my mind up to new concepts. This came with crunchy homemade potato chips. \n\nThe one thing that stood out to me, no two, no three, was our server hanging at the bar with two bartenders all text messaging when we really needed her attention, two= the runner stood outside the kitchen chewing gum worse than I have ever seen a cow chew cud and three, the owner walking around while on his laptop and even sat in the vestibule on it as we were leaving, get an office. It was kind of him to ask us if we wanted a bag for our containers on our way out, since the server never offered them.\n\nThis was not meant to be my 700th review and I have so many that I am behind on, but I felt the need to let you know Chow284 is here. I'm hoping my next visit will be much better now that I understand their format in operating. The jambalaya intriqued me enough to want to go back, hopefully it's awesome.",

  "text": "Some eighteen hours after ingesting it, I'm still amazed that the best Indian meal I ever have had was in this small, nondescript hole-in-the-wall tucked away in the middle of an off-the-beaten-path strip mall in Clearwater, Florida. Eager for a change of pace from the chow mein palaces, seafood joints, and steakhouses prevalent in the area, we made the effort to find this place despite a heavy downpour resulting in a lengthy traffic jam. Its modest outward appearance might have deterred us had it not been for the number of people within - if that many were willing to come here in a deluge, it must be good, no? And indeed it was. No, not just good . . . outstandingly superb or superbly outstanding, take your pick, both are fitting descriptions of a dinner that definitely was worth the trek in what ended up being the fourth worst storm in Tampa Bay history. I stress the weather only because on an evening when most people were content to stay home with leftovers, a Lean Cuisine, or delivery from Domino's, a few dozen had braved the elements to come here. Clearly it wasn't for the decor, which heavily suggests this was an Italian trattoria before its current incarnation. What drew them was the food, which is rich, flavorful, plentiful, and inexpensive. We decided to eat family-style, and ordered a number of dishes we shared. Given the choices of mild, medium, or spicy, we fortunately opted for medium, since it provided just enough fire without leaving us thirsting for relief the rest of the night. We started with an appetizer platter which included samosas and vegetable, cheese, and chicken pakoras, four of each, which made dividing them among us a simple task. This was followed by tandoori chicken - a hearty portion of three drumsticks and three large breasts served on a bed of sauteed onions and green peppers - creamy palak paneer, butter chicken in a thick tomato-based sauce, ginger and garlic-infused curried lamb with tomatoes and onions, peshawari naan (stuffed with coconut, almonds, cashews, raisins, and cherries), the house naan (topped with chicken, garlic, and cilantro), and fluffy, grease-free poori. Each dish had its own distinct flavor, and all were served with basmati rice. Friendly and very attentive service was provided by a sweet blue-eyed blonde teenager and a hippie-looking, college-age busboy, unexpected in an ethnic eatery, but not surprising considering its location. The total bill for four, including a couple of beers and two iced teas, tax, and tip, was an amazingly low $99 . . . and we brought home enough leftovers for a second meal. A lunch buffet, served Monday through Friday from 11:30am until 2:30pm and priced at only $7.95, will have us returning next week. Even in far more sophisticated culinary centers like New York City or San Francisco, Laziz would be a five-star gem.",

  "text": "Rare Ethnic Food 52. Ethiopian cuisine \n\nIt is close to 4.5 stars for my experience today. I kind agree some food need to tone up the spicy taste. However the spice and ingredients are there. With that said. Let me get into the experience. \n\nMitmita is actually meaning one of the Ethiopian Spice. It can be mixed and make many dish. I like the restaurant reflecting their true calling. The culture of food is use a piece of injera to pick up a bit of entree by hand and eat it. That is how it done to enjoy the different cuisine. \n\nWe have a group there can try different dishes. Injera is a crepe type sheet for pick up the food. The best dish is the Ye-doro Wat. This is a chicken dish with Ethiopian Ber-bere sauce. The sauce has so many ingredients. It is flavorful. We also order the  Kat Wat the chop beef with Ethiopian bbq sauce, Kitfo the lean beef is with the Mitmita sauce, Gored Gored the raw tenderloin beef with amaze sauce. Those are good dishes. \n\nAfterward we have Ethiopian coffee with ceremony incense to celebrate special occasions. It was a great celebration. On the appetizers, we have the chicken, veggies, and beef sambusa. Very tasty. We have good time there.",

  "text": "Pi, a place where one can get hand-tossed or Chicago-esq pizza in University City's Loop district.  This is a place my aunt had been wanting to try, so she dragged us down there to give it a whirl.  We ordered up a KIRKWOOD and subbed out the red peppers for pepperoni (slight upcharge), a Schlafly's seasonal draft, some wine and their signature drink called \"Pi Squared.\"  The pizza came our pretty quickly for being as thick as it was.  The sauce on top was nice and chunky and had a great flavor, as did the Italian meatballs, but the pizza crust just had too much corn meal for my liking.  So I ate my two slices, and avoided the crust where possible.\n\nThe service was fantastic.  Our server was energetic and on the ball, despite having a full dinning room to tend to.  I'd like to return and try their hand tossed pizza.",

  "text": "My childhood is filled with memories of enjoying the annual Philadelphia Flower Show and then walking to Vietnam for some lunch/dinner with my family.  This has happened more times than I can count, and each time its been wonderful.  It may not be the typical family tradition, but it's mine and I love it.  \n\nEven now that I live in CO, any opportunity I have to come back to Vietnam is an exciting day indeed.\n\nI've been to Vietnam more times than I can count and two things are guaranteed, my Mom and I order the Flaming Volcano for two, and the table shares the BBQ Platter.  If this is all you eat and drink at Vietnam you'll be in heaven.\n\nThe Flaming Volcano for two includes rum, vodka, gin, brandy, grenadine, Bacardi 151 and fruit juice.  This is a boozy beverage and will leave two people feeling the buzz as they suck down every drop.  And don't let them take the drink too soon, as the ice melts and mixes with the remaining booze and juice you can have a \"second drink\".  Don't forgot to blow out the flame and drink the rum from the center, it's a warm burn as it makes it's way slowly down your throat.  \n\nThe BBQ Platter includes, crispy spring rolls, beef stuffed grape leaves, char-grilled chicken, grilled meat balls, rice vermicelli, lettuce, and rice paper sprinkled with crushed peanuts.  They say this serves two people but I think this easily serves four to five people, especially if you're ordering entrees.  The crispy spring rolls are those addicting spring rolls that you dream about.  If I was on a desert island and could only have three things, I would want these spring rolls to be one of the three items.  In addition to the spring rolls, the grilled meatballs are delicious and I love taking the lettuce or the rice paper and making a wrap with the rice vermicelli, char-grilled chicken, pickled vegetables and topping the whole thing with some peanut sauce.  The BBQ Platter will feed the table and people will fight over the last bites.\n\nI've tried multiple entree items and they have all been good, but nothing has the variety that the BBQ Platter offers.  The BBQ Platter gives you multiple items and a mixture of tastes that a single entree cannot offer.  Take my word for it, order the BBQ Platter!  And if you're feeling a bit crazy, the Flaming Volcano for two is the perfect accompaniment.",

Delachaise is the perfect little bistro when you want to enjoy a night out, but you don't want to get overly fancy.\n\nMy favorites on the food menu are the gourmet grilled cheese and the cheese plate. I have tried many cheeses on the cheese plate and I've always been delighted by my choices. The gourmet grilled cheese is to die for. It's so rich that you can pretty much split it with a friend.\n\nI really like the seating area by the window, and it's always a perfect night when I am lucky enough to grab this limited spot. Sitting on the patio is perfect for early evening as the sun begins to set and the night winds down.\n\nThere is an extensive wine selection so you are sure to find something that suits your tastes.",

I got three spears, and they're just so good!!\n\nThe ribs were great, chewy, no fall off the bone here. I ate most sans sauce, but I did try the coffee sauce and the mustard sauce.\n\nThe coffee sauce was great. The mustard sauce was too totally mustardy.\n\nThe corn chowder was creamy good with snappy kernels of corn, and appropriately hot. It had a bit of a kick to it. It was earthy, so I would say cumin.\n\nMy girlfriend's porto fries were Portobello mushrooms cut like steak fries, breaded and deep-fried. They were made ON THE SPOT, exactly when she ordered them, and brought to the table.\n\nShe shared one with me, and they were fabulous.\n\nA lot of interesting sides were available this day, and I had trouble selecting just one.\n\nI took home half of the corn chowder, two ribs and three pickle spears, which made for another glorious meal.\n\nTO NOTE: There is now a BIG sign over the appropriate entrance door. The sign reads: ENTER. So, I got it right this time.\n\nEvenso, we did witness many folks entering through the exit door and making their way backwards through the cafeteria line to get to the order area.

  "text": "I am absolutely loving Rebar Coffee. Matt Christianson, the brain behind Union Ale and American Ale, has hit it out of the park with this adorable cafe. \n\nRebar serves delicious drip coffee, lattes, and cold brew. They have an assortment of bottled, cold beverages, as well as, local beer and wine. They also offer fresh squeezed orange and tomato juices. \n\nOn a hot day, I usually opt for the cold brew. It is rich, bold and tasty! When I'm looking to warm up, I tend to order an Almond Milk Latte - sooo good! Or an Almond Milk Vanilla Latte, made with a touch of their house made Vanilla Bean Syrup. I am so delighted that they make their syrups in house rather than using the ordinary Torani brand syrups. \n\nRebar offers breakfast daily, fresh baked pastries and lunch items including massive, gourmet burgers with fries, pizzas and salads. \n\nI've had the Sticky Bun multiple times and it is the dessert sweet dreams are made of! Imagine a cinnamon bun but better, doughy on the inside, crispy, perfectly caramelized crust on the outside, topped with candied nuts and a sauce that trickles down the outside ridges of the crust, mmmm good! \n\nI also highly recommend the Ricotta toast which consists of an extra thick slice of fresh baked bread, topped with a generous slather of hand pulled ricotta cheese and finished off with a layer of jam of your choice (Blueberry Strawberry, Strawberry Rhubarb, Peach or Honey). I had it with Strawberry Rhubarb and it was fantastic! Not too sweet and very filling. It could be a light meal on it's own or order one to share as a little amuse bouche for your table. \n\nThe Avocado Bacon & Egg Sandwich is definitely worth a mention as well. House made Brioche bun, baked to golden perfection, sandwiching a fried egg over medium, several slices of thick, smokey bacon, smashed fresh avocado and topped with diced chives. The sandwich comes with a Chipotle Ketchup that I've heard is wonderful, however, I love a combination of sweet and savory for breakfast so I substitute the ketchup for house made jam, usually Strawberry Rhubarb. It's heavenly! If you've ever had the breakfast sandwich at Renaud's, this is reminiscent of that (only slightly different ingredients), and served with a much better bread in my opinion, because the brioche does not tear up my gums like the bread at Renaud's does. Just try it, it's worth it!\n\nIt would not be a complete review without mentioning the ambiance, decor, location and music. Rebar feels like a respite from the hustle and bustle of State Street, even though it's located right on it. Walking into Rebar is like stepping back in time to the Prohibition-Era. Natural wood, metal and steel accents, the greatest jazz humming through unseen speakers and beautiful large windows to people watch. \n\nThere is also a huge, dog friendly outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables. They'll even bring a water bowl for your pooch(es). I know because I've brought my two loves. ;) \n\nThe staff is warm and friendly. They all seem very well-trained. There is free wifi, password: 214union. \n\nParking is easy in their lot adjacent to Rebar, or if necessary, you can park across the street in the Amtrak lot where the first 75 mins are free.\n\nThe only note I have of constructive feedback is regarding the bathrooms, which are located next to the patio and across from the kitchen doors. They are often dirty and need regular attention. I suggest having an hourly or bi-hourly schedule for the staff to check the bathrooms and do any clean up necessary. It is very off putting when a bathroom is in disgusting condition at a restaurant because it gives off a vibe of uncleanliness. Something I would not associated with my restaurant if I owned one. Other than that, I'd say Rebar is close to perfect for a little cafe.",

I feel that Liberty Lands Park is a little better when it comes to wide open space, but the area around Clark Park has so much more to offer (at least for now since the part of Northern Liberties by Liberty Lands is under a lot of construction).\nThere's also plenty of events going on inside it. Flea and Farmers's markets galore as everyone else has said. But it also has one of my favorite music fests every summer (even though it ended up not letting all the bands who were scheduled to play this year play!).

This place is not only so totally delicious that you'll find yourself gazing at your empanada whispering, where have you been all my life...but hands down the best service I've received in all of Boise.  We were greeted upon entrance by one of the owners (Monica?  I think) and when we told her that our seven-year-old had never had an empanada--she immediately showed him what one looked like (she actually had a clay/plaster empanada for this very situation) and told him the most popular fillings for children.  This was awesome and completely demystified what had a moment before been \"weird food\" to my son.  I can't say enough about the service--she was so very sweet to us.  \n\nI ordered their Fugazza empanada, which was filled sautéed onions, mozzarella, and spices.  It was heady with herbs and flavor.  My dining companion ordered the Moleh, which was chicken in sweet sauce (chocolate, peanuts, and various chilies) and was pleased, though said the flavor was a bit unusual and wouldn't be for everyone (I didn't dig it).  My seven-year-old got the Hawaiian, which was the usual pineapple, ham, and mozzarella.  He was delighted.  The prices were incredible.  $2.25 per empanada.  We each had one, which was enough for me, but my dining companion could have eaten two plus dessert. \n\nWe didn't partake in the dessert empanadas as we had already promised the little guy fro-yo.  However, we have every intention of doing so!  And, once we do, I will definitely update.",

This is a much larger restaurant than you'll typically find me, but they've done a stellar job of separating the various dining rooms to make it feel more manageable.  The decor varies in each of the dining rooms as well.  The front area feels like a Parisian sidewalk cafe, perfect for a casual lunch, glass of wine, etc.  The main dining room and bar area is more traditional, while the rear dining room has a classier upscale vibe, with some stunning artwork.  Don't miss the paintings near the restrooms.  They will put a smile on your face. \n\nI know, that's a lot to swallow before even considering the menu, which is amazing in its own right.  Let me stop here to tell you that whatever you do, do not miss the French onion soup.  If there was ever a bowl of soup worthy of a $15 price tag, this is it. Combine it with some of the best bread and butter you'll find anywhere and a glass of wine from one of the best wine lists in the city, and you've got a starter that will leave a lasting impression.  Pace yourself, because you'll want to experience more mouth-watering creations.\n\nThe only thing that matches the food and atmosphere, is the service.  Truly NOLA 5-staresque.

  "text": "There's a reason that Babe's Pizza has been in business for around 30 years.  Their pizza is amazing!  I will never forget the first time that my friends took me here.  I remember driving up and seeing an old, strange looking building with \"Babe's\" written on the outside of it.  Um, just exactly where are we going?  Once I had a bite of this pizza I was a believer.  The double decker pizza is unlike any other pizza I've ever had.  Imagine a pizza on top of a pizza with gooey, delicious cheese and sauce crammed into most of the crust.  We order ours with extra sauce to make it even better!  You'll be surprised at how few slices it takes to make you really full!  While you're eating your pizza you can watch the model train that circles the entire length of the dining room.  I love supporting local businesses like this.  Babe's make it easy because the owners/workers are SO nice and the pizza is SO good.  If you're coming here on a Friday or Saturday night I would suggest arriving early because this place gets packed on the weekends.\n\nProtip: Babe's has a very small parking lot.  They are located behind an Einstein Bagel.  You are allowed to park in the Einstein parking lot.  Einstein is only open during the day and Babe's is only open at night.  They agreed to share their parking lots.",

It is right in the middle of Jackson square which is pretty awesome, and they have a ghost table!  \n\nHere they have a pretty cool dining package you can do. For $45 you can order a appetizer, entree, and desert. Myself and a couple others at my table decided to do just this. \n\nFor my appetizer I had the seafood gumbo. This was by far the biggest disappointment for me for the night. The lack of flavor in the gumbo was noticed and it just did not have a lot of taste. The seafood was mostly just shrimps and I did not notice anything else in it.  \n\nFor my main course I got the Shrimp and Grits. This for sure was a different take on Shrimp and Grits than what I am used to but it was very good. It came in a large bowl and had about 8 gumbo golf shrimp, and a nice large portion of savory grits. It was a lot of food, and it sat very heavy. I would get it again, but not very late at night and would prob share with someone. \n\nFor desert I got the Bread Pudding. It was very good. It was my friends birthday so they gave her a complimentary King Cake which was a really nice gesture!  \n\nI would for sure go back here and I do highly recommend it!",

Still, there's much to like about this sports bar: plenty of seating, flatscreen TVs, and a spacious front area. Did I mention tons of parking?\n\nThe Saturday I was here, I was pleasantly surprised to see a DJ spinning. (He wasn't bad.) While there was a good-sized crowd, they must have had the AC on full blast - we were freezing!\n\nJordan, our helpful server, was fast and friendly.\n\nCelebrating a birthday, we knocked back shots (in classy plastic cups): chocolate cake, dirty girl scout, alien secretion (my favorite), and the time-tested Jolly Rancher. Apparently there's a three-shot maximum? (Not sure if Jordan made that up.)\n\nTheir wings were okay, a bit burnt, somewhat pricey for what we got. Additionally, they wouldn't mix wing flavors. (Don't blame them, but I was disappointed.) Try their other bar food, but your mileage may vary.",

When I finally got a chance to try Taqueria Monterrey I was a little impressed and a little disappointed. \n\nAs far as service goes, it could be better. As Tony mentions, once you order and get your drink you might never see you waiter or waitress again. Not something someone would normally worry about at the Taco Bus since normally you just get your food and eat it yourself. \n\nThey have horchata like the Taco Bus, but it wasn't as good here. I think the jug might have been sitting around because the cinnamon sweet taste was far too strong to really enjoy. The salsa bar had some interesting options, though I preferred their salsa.\n\nI had carne asada tacos, which I always order at the Taco Bus. It was tasty, but I could notice differences in the seasoning/flavoring of the meat and found myself wishing I had gone to the Taco Bus instead.\n\nTaqueria Monterrey isn't bad (and certainly better then some other Mexican options in Tampa), but it isn't really good either.",

The wall is covered with awards, so you can chose your award winning flavor, including pepper rose, prickly pear carmel, matcha sesame rice milk, and blueberry oat cardamon.

The house was built in 1859, and was the first home to be listed on the Chesterfield Historic Register.\n\nYou can figure out which room was the family room, the dining room, the sunporch and the kitchen on the first floor. Upstairs are bedrooms and a couple bathrooms that have been repurposed.\n\nOne of the bathrooms was full of children's toys, plush animals, pull-toys and the like.\n\nThis is folk art, Early American, colonial, Americana -- whatever you want to call it, but you get the idea.\n\nOfferings include scarves, candles (both artificial and real), soaps, quilts, pillows, pottery, linens, placemats, rag rugs and many other soft items.\n\nSome of the real candles had spot-on smells, like oatmeal-raisin cookie, Santa cookie crumbles, lavender, sugar cookie. The soaps smelled fabulous, too: oatmeal, lavender and numerous others.\n\nAnd they had hogwash soap, which is an all-natural stain-remover. A perfect offering, for being in Hog Hollow.\n\nLots of furniture.\n\nEarrings and other jewelry that were quite inviting.\n\nMany hand-crafted decorations. Metal works and wood works of pigs, cows and other barnyard animals. Hand-made dolls. American flags everywhere in many varieties and displayed in artwork, on dolls, framed and other permutations.\n\nMany primitive artwork framed originals, some going for upwards of $300.\n\nOn the second floor there are three large rooms, including a 10% off sale room. Here, we found Christmas ornaments and decorations (some metal, some cloth), braided rag rugs, lighted branches to create your own wonderland and many other decorative things.\n\nIn the kitchen we were generously offered a cappuccino, but we declined, since we'd just had lunch.\n\nThe kitchen held beautiful little appetizer forks and spoons; silicon lid covers in many sizes; Wind & Willow soup, dip, salsa, cheeseball and baking mixes; red pepper jelly and green pepper jelly; Texas hot rub; and a colander that works for draining as well as steaming. I was a bit intrigued by that. I believe I was silicon.\n\nA great lot of quality offerings.",

I am sure you've already looked at the pictures and know that you'll get a chance to seat on the beach while enjoying a meal. Although that's absolutely true, I'll write about an element that pictures won't describe.\n\nFun and friendly staff make the visit worthwhile. You'll get a piece of fish anywhere in St Pete, but finding such great people is hard. The bartender was managing a ridiculous influx of thirsty tourists and doing it in a friendly, efficient manner. All drinks are made from pre-made Walmart shelf mixers, so don't expect anything exquisite. Rum selection is as basic as it gets, Bacardi, Morgan or well. The place has a very typical, average American beach bar feel to it. Of course, that comes included with country music and southern middle class crowd. In other words, people who want to be country, but live in a city like Birmingham, Mobile, Augusta and the like.\n\nFood is fine. Again, standard stuff. The much recommended artichoke dip was pretty good. Seafood selections aren't phenomenal, but there. Lots of fried items as you'd expect at an American beach bar.\n\nThe establishment shines of course in one area and that's its location. Right on the beach, it's a perfect spot to watch the sunset and have a beer.",

  "text": "Just the mention of the name Buffalo Billiards takes me back to the early-mid 90s when every summer weekend night ended up with a foray down 2nd Ave.  It typically ended up at Buffalo Billiards or the upstairs Havana Lounge where the cigars smoked and the swing band played.  Ah college!\n\nAfter moving away for 11 years and getting a little above the age of the usual suspects down on 2nd Ave I could barely believe it when I heard that they were still open.  A friend decided to get togther at BB this weekend and I was pleased to \"party like its '95\" again!  \n\nThisplace has changed considerably from the old days but not in a bad way.  Downstairs is now a Dick's Last Resort so gone is the huge room full of pool tables and cute boys.  Upstairs where the Havana Lounge was is now the entirety of Buffalo Billiards.  Don't worry though, it is still a pretty sizeable bar!  The huge round bar still exists and these great big Samsung HDTVs are all around the bar.  (Bonus - they had the one in front of me on the NASCAR race!!)  Tables are also available on the left side of the bar.  In the back is another bar and two rooms with pool tables.  Note that you can reserve one or both of these two rooms for private parties (as I have for my December birthday)!  \n\nThey had good 90s rock playing (Soundgarden! Pearl Jam!  Alice in Chains!) which will take you back ,again, in a good way.  The vibe is chill and you can actually hear each other talk.  Drinks were strong - they were not playing around with these.  And all the bartender/bartendress staff I saw were good lookin, so you can have some eye candy with your drink.  Also noticed a dart board in the back too so you can challenge your friends to a duo of bar games (maybe a trio if you play quarters or something?  No?  But it's 1995 man!)\n\nSo yeah, I loved the vibe and the whole feel of this place and am glad I have it reserved for my birthday in a few months.  Give it a try if you are downtown and want to get away from crazy tourist traps and Irish-pub-dance-club places!",

This is not your typical Americanized joint. Is it fast? Yes, but that's as American as it gets. Portions are definitely generous and you won't find sweet and sour chicken on this menu...unless I read it wrong. Yelpers in the know of the legit Chinese food directed me CPH. I wouldn't have made it through my first experience without their guidance! 30 shrimp/pork dumplings, 1 pork bun, and 1 order or fried rice later, I got a good taste of MSG free Chinese Cuisine. While China Pasta House literally is a noodle house with most dishes resembling Pho or Udon dishes you can also enjoy Century Eggs, Gruel, rice dishes, Hot Pot and more. The noodle dishes are really soups and portions are huge and spicy here mean spicy, like a level ten spicy. While fellow yelpers broke a sweat over their noodle dishes I peacefully enjoyed my fried rice and Pork Bun. I'd never seen anything like it! So if you love spicy food then this place is for you. You're bound to run into Chinese students and families at this spot. For sure check out the the specials as they feature several soups that are on the regular menu and it's a good way to taste something new and not commit to full-sized entree.  \n-If you're not super familiar with Chinese food, it's ok! I'm not either....read the Yelp reviews first!",

I know that while it will be expensive, all the food will be good, the service will be friendly, and the atmosphere will be clean and comfortable.\n\nMy friend and I sat in the bar - first at the bar for cocktails, and then moving into a bar booth for dinner.  Our server was efficient, although a little slammed with all the tables she had going.  Great deals for happy hour from 5-7 - they offer 5-$6 drinks, and 5-$5 appetizers.  \n\nTaking advantage of the discounts, we shared the pork belly and tenderloin carpaccio to start with.  The pork belly was just okay - the best part of that plate was actually the creamy goat cheese grits that accompanied it - yum!  The sweet onion chutney was just not enough of a contrast with the rest of the plate.\n\nThe carpaccio was excellent.   It was a generous portion, sliced extremely thin, with capers and a creole mustard sauce on top,  with cheesy crackers to put it on.  My one wish would have been more 'bite' to the sauce.\n\nFor dinner I had the French Onion soup and the small plate of New Bedford Scallops.  This was one of the best French Onion soups I have ever had.  It was baked with both gruyère and parmesan cheeses, with a nice crispness to the bread inside.  The cheese topping was incredible, and the broth was flavorful without being too salty.\n\nI liked the scallops, but didn't love them.  The sauce had flavor, but the scallops didn't really seem to.  I  know, I know, only eat steak in a steakhouse, but I'm a seafood girl!\n\nFor dessert  we split the carrot cake.  Since I am a carrot cake connoisseur, I will rate this one 6/10.  Very moist which I love, it did not have even close to enough frosting on it/in it.  I guess that's why they serve it with a side of homemade whip cream - there needs to be some sweetness to contrast the non-sweet flavor of the cake part.  More than just a tiny drizzle of dark rum caramel on the side was needed, too.\n\nFinal thought - GET WIFI!  Sheesh - close to the airport, close to many businesses - enter this century and make the upgrade - thanks!",

  "text": "I will preface this review by admitting that we are lucky enough to have a couple five daughters bakery locations in Atlanta, where I actually left. However, I was helping my friend move to Nashville and on our morning walk, we decided to stop by L & L market. When I realized there was a Five Daughters Bakery inside of the market, I told my friend we needed to get a doughnut. I was actually not even in the mood for a doughnut, but I cannot pass by a Five Daughters Bakery without at least considering. We decided to split the pumpkin spice latte seasonal doughnut, and it was really fun to watch my friend enjoy her first five daughters bakery donut. These are just so delicious! The pumpkin spice latte donut was so good! It had a cream cheese filling and they used a bit of coffee to nod to the latte flavoring. I actually only ate about a quarter of the donut, but it really was so delicious!",

  "text": "If ever you've been confused by a review of mine where I gave a popular restaurant with high ratings a low star review... then come to Tito's and see why!!!\n\nSo far I've only tried the CHURRASCO SKIRT STEAK PLATE ($14) with yellow rice, but I honestly don't know if I will ever try anything else because it was SOOOO GOOD! Seasoned by angels and cooked with such perfection that I will absolutely crave this for the rest of my life! THIS, my dear Yelp people, is EXACTLY what I mean by \"flavorful\" seasoning. They have completely ruined skirt steak cooked by anyone else because I can't go back to anything less than this level of satisfaction! Even the Strawberry Banana Smoothie ($6) is excellent!\n\nTito's is currently located in an empty lot next to the Citgo Gas Station on the corner of North Jones Ave and West Waters Street, but this is also the location of their soon to be brick & mortar restaurant. So if you love New York style Puerto Rican cuisine, rush here as soon as possible and taste heaven on a plate!\n\n2021 / 91",

You are paying a premium for 'cool' decor that you might see in an Emma Stone movie, but the novelty of that wears off after like 15 minutes. I'm glad they kept the music volume at a level that allows you to talk. +1\n\nFood?! We had pork and chicken dumplings, which were delicious, but the Price-to-Portions ratio (PPR -- metric I invented here) not so hot. Scallops were great, too, but again PPR too high. Even though we blew three dishes, we still felt we hadn't eaten much.\n\nThe red snapper was a real bust. Overly done and dry. Not sure if it was an off-night or what, but it just didn't taste good at all. Shoshana refused to touch it, and since I don't like microwaved fish, I had to force it down just to make sure I got full value.\n\nOverall, it's just a 3 due to PPR and hype-reality issues.",

There were fresh flowers, water & condiments to set the mood. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed the coffee and atmosphere the macaroons were a total fail.

Because the menu is giant and the quality is great.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI booked this spot a while ago because it had a very strong 4.5 star rating and is close to my house. But recently, I noticed that 4.5 upticked to 5 stars overall, so I knew I had to make it a priority to stop in. We did so today and were very impressed.\n\nWe started off with wanting one sushi roll. I couldn't decide which one to go with when our server suggested an off-menu roll called the Roger Roll (named after the owner.) All I really remember from her description was crab with a bunch of other stuff that sounded good, so I was sold. It came out with a bunch of thin, fried... tentacles on top? Not sure how else you'd describe them, but they were delicious and added a nice crunch.\n\nWe tried to fatty tuna sashimi next and this was the only unfortunate miss for us. When we visited Tokyo, we loved getting fatty tuna as much as possible, but this was nothing like it. It was warmed and I guess pretty cooked? It didn't really even taste like tuna. I'd avoid this in the future.\n\nBoth of our main courses were excellent: pad thai and crispy chicken cashew nut. The pad Thai was a tad sweeter than normal. Our server said she doesn't normally like pad Thai but does like their version - I could understand why. It wasn't wildly different than normal pad Thai, but just a couple ticks tastier than usual. And the crispy chicken cashew nut was also very enjoyable. \n\nWe finished with coconut ice cream and mango with sticky rice for dessert. The mango stick rice was fine, but the coconut ice cream stole the show. Also, our 15 month old acted as if it was the best thing he'd ever had in his young life. \n\nFor the majority of the time, we were the only customers in here, but we did arrive about 2 minutes after they opened on a Sunday afternoon. I hope they have a steady rush of customers because they certainly deserve it!",

  "text": "Lettuce Lake Park is one of my favorite natural wildlife parks in the Tampa Bay area. The park is located along Fletcher Avenue, east of USF and just before you hit I-75. Lettuce Lake Park can be found on the northern edge of Tampa, and it protects 240 acres along the Hillsborough River. There's a bend in the river within the boundaries of this park, and that forms a swamp and a small natural lake which is filled with water lettuce vegetation.\n\nLettuce Lake Park provides a quiet sanctuary for hikers, bicyclists, boaters, and picnickers. There is a $2 per car cash admission into the park which certainly seems very reasonable considering how clean they keep the park and the restrooms. I saw maintenance guys emptying trash cans and mopping the floors in the restrooms while I was there.\n\nThere are large public green spaces with playgrounds for the kids, covered picnic shelters with fireplace grills, and wooded picnic tables throughout the park. If you prefer to hike / jog / bicycle then you'll find a trail, complete with a fitness course, which meanders through the park. There's also a 3500 foot elevated wooden boardwalk which winds through the hardwood swamp forest, and eventually brings you to a three-story wooden observation deck overlooking the river and the entire park. You can climb up to the top with the other Touristas Americanus Loudmouthus and try your luck yelling at the turtles and alligators.\n\nMore than half of the park's property lies in the natural floodplain of the Hillsborough River, and consists of a hardwood swamp forest (cypress and oak trees) as described above. This unique feature provides a natural storage reservoir for floodwater and it helps to improves our water quality, acting as a natural biological filter to remove excess nutrients from the water. As a result, visitors to Lettuce Lake Park will have the opportunity to observe the pine flatwoods plant communities, and a huge variety of wildlife. You'll no doubt see birds, turtles, and possibly an alligator or two from the safety of the boardwalk.\n\nThis past weekend I rented a kayak from the ranger stand at the front gate - $25 for 4 hours - and drove back to the river access area where I was handed a personal flotation jacket, and given a brief safety overview and navigation tour of the waterway. After that I was off, and peacefully paddling along the river, and then just drifting along as I took some photos. I was able to explore the lake area just north of the observation tower, and saw some 3 - 4 foot gators happily swimming along or laying up on the banks. There were turtles galore in the water, and all sorts of fish munching on the water lettuce. Plenty of egrets and herons had already flown south and made the park their winter home.\n\nWhat a glorious afternoon, and I highly recommend just getting outdoors and enjoying some of the Florida sunshine at one of our awesome natural parks. Hope to see you here!",

I mean I guess it's an oasis on Bourbon street? \n\nWe were desperate and the only place that was open for food was Mambos. \n\nOyster Rockefeller: ok 3/5. Served warm, greasy, looks amazing in photos but really wasn't very substantial not even for an appetizer. Quite expensive considering that. \n\nCajun pasta: 3/5... I could make it better at home. \n\nBread pudding: 5/5 pretty darn delicious. \n\nSeasonal cocktail: 3.5/5 while it was delicious it was LOADED WITH SUGAR ickkkk.

The ordering is very quick but then you often have a very long wait to get your order as many people are ordering for MANY people and get a big box full of snowballs.  Overall its a good snowball at a value price for the larger sizes they offer along with a good flavor selection.",

  "text": "I do not give out five starts lightly. As I thought about this review though, I could not think of any significant reasons to give a lower rating. The hotel reached out to me over a week before our arrival to help us plan our trip. After a quick few emails we had a great trip all handled. They took care of everything.\n\nWe opted for the valet, but there is self parking available. From the moment we arrived the entire staff was fantastic. Check in was quick and painless. We always carry out own bags so we chose to do so here. Lesson learned, when we went to leave we used the bell desk. This property is on a hill and large. I recommend utilizing the bell desk staff for your bags.\n\nOur room was large and well appointed. The bed was comfortable. There was a large patio. It had a separate shower and tub, both of which were large and luxurious. There was a nice gas fireplace in the room too. We had it on quite a bit because it was cooler in the evenings.\n\nWe arrived late in the evening so we could not really see everything that night. The next morning we took a walk through out the property to check everything out. The buildings are all beautiful. The landscaping team is clearly on top of their game too. The pool area has a great retro feel and has a lot of cabanas.\n\nEach day we took advantage of the hiking trails on the property. They are well maintained and easy for everyone. The scenery is great. It is also easy to take a walk on the beach. The sand is well packed so it was easy even with shoes on.\n\nThere are multiple restaurants on site and the bar in the lobby is nice too. There is also a coffee shop. They did have coffee set up in the lobby for free though each morning, so we took advantage of that.\n\nThe spa was nice. We did not do any treatments, but we took advantage of the amenities. We both really enjoyed the eucalyptus steam rooms. My skin felt amazing after a few minutes in them. It is also very peaceful. There were hot tubs and saunas as well.\n\nOverall it was a great experience. We may have found our new go to for our trips to Santa Barbara. It is not affordable, but the experience is well worth it.",

  "text": "During Labor Day weekend we went jet skiing at Woody's and decided to stop next door at The Hut Bar and Grill for lunch.\n\nMy sister and I ordered the shrimp tacos and my brother-in-law ordered the monster fish sandwich. My brother-in-law's sandwich looked like a huge fish stick and the texture of the fish led us to believe the fish was frozen, not fresh. The shrimp tacos were inedible and may have been the foulest tasting dish I have ever ordered at a restaurant.  I ordered grilled shrimp on my tacos, but there were no grill marks on the shrimp and the shrimp was undercooked.  The soft taco shells smelled really weird... after one bite I could not continue and tried to eat the center of the taco to avoid the shell. My sour cream had yellow liquid in the plastic cup so I skipped using it in fear that the sour cream was spoiled.\n\nIt's a shame the food was not better. The music and water view gave the bar a really cool vibe. I really appreciated the misting fans on the deck and all of the waitresses were super friendly. Maybe I would come back here for a beer, but I would skip ordering food here.",

I honestly don't know how authentic this bakery is, but there is a mix of Korean bakery items, more \"Americanized items, and other random Asian desserts. But nonetheless, it's cute and delicious. \n\nFirst and foremost, I LOVE the creme puffs from here. They are not as sweet as what you thing a creme puff is in bite sizes. You can get a package of 10 and bring it to the Korean restaurants! They have mocha cakes, lots of sponge cakes in a variety of flavors, and general cakes. And if you want to get someone a gift who loves playing pokemon go, this is where you get your pokemon theme cookies. They also have Hello-Kitty cakes. \n\nGreat place to just stop in and they open late for a bakery until 8pm. There are also a few tables for you to sit and enjoy your desserts too!",

And seriously, everyone in Nashville that I've met in my life was there! \n\nThey have a ton of tents with plenty of beer to pass around. There was also a couple wine cooler type tents as well as a whiskey one if I'm not mistaken. They had some great food options, the stir fry noodle tent was a huge hit with a very long line in front of it for a good portion of the night. You also can't go wrong with Mafioza's pizza either! \n\nI really enjoyed that they had a live band playing and a grassy area in the middle to bring chairs to lounge. \n\nMy biggest disappointment was that it rained heavily the last 30 minutes or so and they kicked us out of the tents at 10:00 while it was still pouring. That's not very friendly people! \n\nOtherwise, I had an excellent time!",

But if you come here, I encourage you to try a craft beer. It's well-worth it.\n\nEveryone here is so friendly and welcoming. Even if you're \"new\" to the 'hood, they still make you feel like you belong and will add you to their conversation. The beer prices are also very very good.

  "text": "My friends and I decided to go camping in Fort De Soto Park on Easter weekend.\nWe made a reservation on one of their 236 campsites on their website.\nI think I made a reservation about a month before the weekend, however almost all the good sites were taken by then.  \n\nThe way to the park is absolutely beautiful!  You see the ocean driving on the bridge, and  you see all the nice houses and condos in the area dreaming if you could ever afford something like that oneday in your life.\n\nEvery single campsite comes with a grill, a picnic table, faucet and 50amp electricity.\nThey have nicely maintained bathrooms with showers throughout the sites.  \nThey have trails all along the shore and there is a place you can rent kayaks and bicycles.  But remember those rentals close at 4:30, so as soon as you check in (the check-in time is 1:00pm) you want to get inquires if you are interested in those activities.  We actually could not do any of the stuff since we stayed only one night and did not get there early enough.  You can fish from the shore.  There are lots of fish called \"Panfish\".  There are birds just walking around, ducks, and of course racoons!  Actually we got some of our foods eated by squirrles tho.  \n\nThe only downside is the price.  We did pay close to $50 dollars: $45 for the campsite including county tax, seasonal tax, waterfront charge etc, $1.5 for the toll boothes for 2 cars,  and $3 for a fire pit.   However you do not have to pay for the $5 parking for park visitors.  Thank God!      \n\nAlthough the waterfront costs more (prob like $5 or less), you really want to book a waterfront site in Area 3.  Area 3 is no pet and all campers including RVs.  Even if you have tents,not RVs, you still want to book a waterfront in Area 3.  Why?  Because Area 1(only tents) does not really have waterfront sites, even tho they say they do.  Area 1 waterfront sites are far from the shore and they have trails between the shore and campsites.  They also have trees on the shore so you cannot see any water from the campsites.  On area 3 waterfront campsites, you have an immediate access to the water.  Do not worry!   Even tho the sites for RVs, you won't be surrounded by them because there are trees between each campsite.  \n\nP.S.  There are mosquitos somewhat in April.  Even tho I was the only one who got bit by mosquitos, there were at least 5 bites on my legs.  I did spray bug repellent but I was wearing shorts.",

The theater itself has character and charm, and I'd go out of my way to watch a movie here over a more convenient place with less of the above.\n\nI watched Avatar in 3D at the Arlington and it was a very pleasant experience.  Because the theater is old, it only has one screen and a whole lot of seating, including a balcony, and this set-up gives the place a wide-open opulent feel.  The inside walls are built to mimic a quaint village and the ceiling is painted with stars.  The result, instead of being cheesy, is really just pretty.  The screen isn't the largest and the seats aren't the most comfortable around, but nothing is substandard and the loveliness of the place more than makes up for anything lost in the way of modern convenience.\n\nThe lobby and exterior are beautiful as well, with cute hand-painted signs, a courtyard, and a free-standing ticket booth.  If you're strolling through downtown Santa Barbara without the time to stop for a movie, the theater is still worth a peek.

As classic as Santa Barbara gets, we happened to show up during the Summer Solstice Celebration, without even realizing it was even a thing.\n\nThe obvious cue was how congested the place was when we got there. It wasn't even 11 AM on a Saturday and many streets were closed off, at least the ones around the center of the city where the celebration is held.\n\nParked in a place that offered free parking for the first 75 minutes, and walked on over to the area for the celebration. Lots of beer present, but as I was driving, I could not partake in that aspect. But I could see the abundance of performers, and the throngs of people finding a way to move along as the performers went ahead in a slightly muggy but otherwise cool weather day.\n\nFinally the celebration ended around early afternoon at least from what I could see. \n\nAs this seems to be an annual event, I can't exactly suggest to Yelpers to check this celebration out next week let alone next month, but I'm sure this event repeats annually. Check Google and Yelp around next summer!",

Because it's the perfect time to for some preventative medicine at Golden Flower! \n\nGrab a table and get ready to fight off that hangover with a banging bowl of pho, some delicious imperial egg rolls, or one of their cold noodle dishes! On this last visit I'd had enough liquid courage to allow me to order the most daunting dish on the menu, Bun Bo Hue, a spicy noodle soup made with a rich, complex, and meaty broth, packed full of all the best animal tidbits like well-done flank, rare beef, tendon, and oh yes, blood cake! The version here does tendon right! It cooks for hours in the broth until extremely tender, all the while absorbing the rich flavors of the stock. Andrew Zimmern would describe it as meat jelly, and I'd concur. If it eats like that, you know it's good! The blood cake is harder to describe, but it turns out it was way more a textural thing than a flavor. Kind of thought it would be a little different, but eating it is worth the shock value! I'll be back for more of this soon! \n\nBut slide a big bowl of that up right next to a big plate of the chicken wings they have on their late night menu, and that is a match made in heaven!

You can also purchase tea accessories for that caffeine lover in your life.\n\nBubble tea is probably the most popular thing.  They have the oversized straws that you put in your tea cup that allows you to suck up the globby gooey flavored tea bubbles.  If you have glooby things you should stay away from bubble tea.\n\nThe prices are really affordable for the quality.  The staff is very knowledgeable so if you have tea questions don't hesitate to ask.",

  "text": "I get a mean craving for Vietnamese every once in a while, and I immediately thought of Pho Grand when the craving hit last because I always drive by it but never go. One of my favorite things to do on a weekend rainy day is pick up something delicious to go and bring it home while watching all of my shows on DVR... pure heaven. Pho Grand was a great addition to that equation.\n\nI called Pho Grand and placed an order for pick up and the guy on the phone was really nice, and he gave me a wait time of about 15 minutes. I got there about ten minutes later and scored a parking spot right out front, walked in, and my order was already ready! Also, $13 for an appetizer and an entree? I'm definitely okay with that. \n\nWhen I got home I found that they packaged the food in a great way to where everything was still hot and nothing was running all over other things... that's a common problem when I get things to go! For an appetizer I got the veggie spring rolls, and wow. I know for sure that I'm going to be craving those again sometime this week. They were so fresh, so full of veggies and rice, and if you're a cilantro lover like me you'll be very happy with these. The sweet and sour sauce was pretty standard but a nice compliment, and the lady who gave me my food made it a point to tell me to use the s&s on both the rolls and my entree. For the main course I had the Ga Xao Xa Ot (stir-friend chicken with hot chiles and lemongrass) and it was just alright to me. It was kind of sweet which I didn't really like, and I wasn't crazy about the taste of the chicken. Luckily, the two huge spring rolls filled me up plenty.\n\nI like this place quite a bit! Next time I'll try and dine in to see what else they have to offer. If you're craving a good spring roll or want Vietnamese with really fast service, Pho Grand is your place.",

Really down to earth restaurant with delicious food (although be prepared to wait). It's all about quality over quantity, err'day.\n\nAnyways, we went for lunch on a Tuesday and all three of us decided to get the lunch omakase ($20/person). So instead my usual ramblings and excess overwriting, I'll let the pictures do the talking (everything was top notch).\n\nAs you can see, there was a variety of items to devour :\n\n- Miso soup to start - not too salty. Perfect way to start our meal off on a cold September day.\n- Rice and seaweed salad - I could eat this seaweed salad all day\n- Chicken karage - crunchy, perfectly fried and tender/moist in the inside\n- Salmon and tuna sashimi - nice edible sizes. Tasted very fresh.\n- Oysters - not sure exactly what kind they were but they were slightly on the sweeter side.\n- Salmon collar - cooked perfectly and very tender\n- Tuna tataki - came with with roasted garlic pieces and red onions\n- Seafood ceviche - pieces of octopus, shrimp and fish. Couple of chips to eat the ceviche with. Om nom nom.\n\nJaponais Bistro is a solid, solid spot just west off the downtown core. Definitely a great spot to check out and a classy atmosphere to boot.",

  "text": "Gather 'round, friends. I'd like to tell you the secret to finding decent Mexican food in Indianapolis. It all starts with finding a restaurant with a name that has nothing to do with anything remotely Mexican. Find a restaurant with a gringo name, and you might find someone in the kitchen making good Mexican food (i.e. Biscuits Cafe, Chris's Ice Cream). \n\nBut let's focus on Biscuits Cafe. Does that sound like a good Mexican place to you? Of course not -- why would it? Mexicans don't eat biscuits. It's just not a thing. However, they make really good Mexican food at Biscuits Cafe, so you should visit to partake of their Mexican food. \n\n(Although, I've heard they make awesome biscuits and gravy, too, so you should come for that if you feel in the mood. They serve breakfast all day!)\n\nWe got the chicken tacos al pastor and fajita platter, and both were really good. To me, the sign of a good Mexican place is whether they have good rice and beans. Rice and beans are the backbone to any Mexican meal, so if they are good, then that sets the tone for the rest of the meal. Fortunately, they have excellent refried beans (covered with yellow cheese, as they should) and Mexican rice. The rice doesn't have peas and carrots in it, by the way. My chicken tacos were served with diced onions and cilantro, and I was given two huge bottles of house-made red and green salsa to use at my discretion. The green salsa was mild, and the red salsa had a chipotle bite to it and was a little more spicy. Both were really good and went well with the tacos. \n\nThe fajitas platter comes out sizzling, so be careful when touching the plate! My husband said his fajitas were really good. \n\nMy kids got pancakes and bacon. (I know, right? I mean, we're at a Mexican restaurant ... but what are you gonna do. Kids, dude.) They loved their pancakes! The pancakes come three to an order, but they are kid-sized and come with your choice of meat (bacon or sausage) and fruit. They even provide you with warm syrup to drizzle over your pancakes. My kids ate most of their meal, which is unusual because they usually leave at least 2/3 of it on their plate! Wasteful kids! (Heaven love them.)\n\nLike most Mexican restaurants, Biscuits Cafe gives you complimentary chips and salsa when you sit down. Both are excellent and addicting, as chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant should be.",

  "text": "Giovanni's Pizza is a Italian shop on York Road in Jamison, Pa. They do a big pizza business as suggested by the wall of pizza boxes awaiting use in the entrance hall. When I asked one of the guys behind the counter how many pies they do a day, I was told anywhere from 50 to 300! Quite a range, but they were getting ready for the high end when we were there by cutting up the dough and placing them in small aluminum canisters. \n\nThe house itself has two dining rooms and can accommodate quite a crowd. It is clean, and service is prompt and friendly. We ordered a single plain slice to see how they do with their most basic commodity, an eggplant parmesan sandwich and a burger with onions and mushrooms.  Nothing stood out as exceptional, and some things need work. \n\nThe plain pizza is average in size and taste. Mine was a reheat job, well done. They got that right, and the crust was nice and firm with a mild scorch on the undercarriage. There was too much cheese for me, and not enough sauce. Really could not get the flavor of the tomatoes due to cheesy dominance. Pizza requires the right balance on top to make it stand out. This did not do it. The eggplant parm sandwich was in a large torpedo roll, again covered in copious melted mozzarella. The nightshade itself had a heavy breading that absorbed a lot of oil in the frying.  Would have been better if just sautéed in olive oil without the extra breading, but was still okay. The burger was disappointing. A frozen puck, cooked to well done when medium was requested. Dry and tasteless, despite the additional sautéed onions and mushrooms. Even the ketchup couldn't save it. \n\nThis was a late lunch, and we didn't explore the dinner and pasta options, which may be as good as the other reviewers report. Still, I can only write about my experience, which was not quite middle of the road.\n\n2.5 Stars.",

Take that, all you DC cupcake boutiques! (That means you, Sprinkles!)\n\nI lucked out by choosing a hotel near the shopping center where this cupcakery is located. Yes, cupcakes are all you're gonna get here, but don't frown; they are delicious! The best thing about the two seasonal ones I chose is that they were super moist. I'm a good daughter, and I shared both my treats with my mom. I did scrape off some of the avalanche of super sweet buttercream frosting from my diabetic mom's portion.\n\nThe Charmed cupcake was better than your average pumpkin spiced cupcake with cream cheese frosting, and the Spoiled Rotten was a delicious apple spice cake flavor with apple cider buttercream frosting. It also had a caramel topping and toasted pecans.  Once you try this one, you'll be spoiled from boring, ordinary grocery store cupcakes forever!\n\nNext time I visit Nashville, I'll make sure I make it to the 'Burbs to sample more flavors from IveyCake.",

This adorable lil' area is extremely close to the original Café Du Monde, along with several fabulous bars and shops nearby, and hosts plenty of artists throughout the week. \n\nI stopped here and sat on a bench facing the monument of Andrew Jackson, and enjoyed live music that was being played nearby by a band that was sitting in the square in front of the cathedral. It was slightly dirty around some of the benches -- however, this space is actually pretty clean considering the fact that I didn't notice anyone who looked like they were hired to keep the area clean or keep an eye out for litter. \n\nI'm sure there's so much more history to Jackson Square, but the ghost tour I took where we met here to start didn't mention too much on it, so I have a lot to learn! If you're looking for a lively stop in the French Quarter, for live music, art, or even a tarot card reading, I highly recommend stopping by Jackson Square!",

I felt like a majority of the options was the same bread just different filling. However, after seeing other pics I think they were just out of a lot. \n\nThe matcha mousse had a good matcha flavor.

  "text": "You really can't get better scenery than the serenity and beauty inside the Nevada Museum of Art. The white room with large windows has amazing amounts of natural light, and it almost feels like you're seated outside, and the high ceilings let noise carry and dissipate, giving a sense of privacy in a very open space. \n\nI find Chez Louie to be a great meeting place for all those reasons and more. The food is easy to eat and enjoy. You can be dainty and not feel weird. Ya. I said dainty. So when a wonderful new friend suggested we meet there for lunch I was excited.\n\nI've lunched at Chez Louie twice, and both visits have been enjoyable, but to be honest, I'm waiting for the WOW factor. On the first visit I enjoyed the \"Plate Lunch\", which is a beautifully presented meal featuring the soup du jour, salad, half a tartine (open faced sandwich), and a small dessert. It was good, and left me satisfied me for lunch, touching on the savory and sweet parts of the palette, but I found the price tag a bit out of reach for me on the regular. On this recent visit, I tried the Jambon Brioche, a hot black forest ham and brie sandwich, served on housemade brioche buns, with apricot jam. I had the frites as my side, served with a delicious tarragon aioli, which was honestly my favorite part of the meal. The sandwich was good, piled up with sliced ham, but the thin slices of brie had been over melted and the bun actually had a little bit of char to it as well. It was tasty, but when compared to other meals I've enjoyed in Reno for $13, it just didn't measure up. \n\nMaybe you pay for the atmosphere at Chez Louie, which is why I'm tempted to give it the fourth star. Sitting in the atrium and enjoying a glass or wine or beer would be nice any day of the week, but the food has left me wanting more. I've had some really amazing things prepared by Chef Shakka before, so I'm hopeful the menu will continue to evolve overtime, but I'm also prepared for the reality that maybe French bistro faire isn't going to deliver it for me though.",

People can dock their boats or pull up their kayaks or paddleboards on the sand. Urban Kai offers paddleboarding rentals here for $35 per hour and kayaks for $25 per hour. There are two bars and plenty of seating with views of the water. The bartender Kristen was very nice and attentive.

I had the hurricane and Macdill grog and they were pretty good. I have to detract a star as $9 per drink and $6 for wells is a bit pricey. I also have to detract a star for the parking lot.

  "text": "Such a great addition to the food scene and Oro Valley area! And such a fitting name too! Love it. The menu features Banh Mi (aka French influenced Vietnamese sandwiches . There are  six different options ranging from \n BBQ Pork, Grilled Chicken, Lemongrass Beef, Tofu. All Banh Mi are served with pate, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo, pickled daikon/carrots, cucumber.  You can opt out of pate and mayo to make the tofu vegan. \n\nWe ordered three to try! Not sure when we'll have time to go back! We ordered the lemongrass beef, Grilled BBQ Pork and the Tofu.\n\nOur favorite was the Grilled BBQ pork. The tofu tasted a little runny- not sure if that's the standard way of serving it. THe bread was warm and crispy and quite good. I hear it it sourced from Ghini's Le Baguette bakery...which is awesome! \n\nI enjoyed the rose milk tea for dessert. It was plenty sweet and extra floral! I have my eye on a few other boba items for my next visit. \n\nYou can order online, here on Yelp or just call it in!\n\n\n.",

  "text": "Another Labor Day Weekend = Another Rib Cook-off at the Nugget\nIt was time to roll out my \"PETA\" shirt....and practice some stomach stretching!\n\nHere's this year's breakdown of some of the obvious similarities and differences from years past:\n\nSimilarities.......\n-The competitors.....representing different parts of the country\n-PETA (People for the Eating of Tasty Animals) was out in full force!...Huge crowds as usual.\n-Bone Daddy's BBQ was a hit again....taking People's Choice this year\n-Sauces and rubs for sale.  We definitely stocked up!\n-Street vendors (probably more tents this year).  Great variety of items for sale from crafts to ShamWOW!\n-Live music on different stages while ribbin out.....and some dancin too!   \n-The fresh squeezed lemonade, fire roasted corn, Texas-style tators, humungus beer-battered onion rings, and beer were our choices of staples this time around.  I guess I didn't have enough room for the usual funnel cakes, fried zucchini, and pulled pork fries. \n\nDifferences........\n-Reigning champ Joey Chestnut lost to Pat Bertoletti in the Rib Eating Championships.\n-Armadillo Willy's became a new competitor this year (didn't place).\n-More funny t-shirts for sale that said: \"I'm a Master Baster\" and \"My Rack Is BIG.........In Japan\"\n-Only tasted ribs from about 14 different companies, instead of our usual over 20 tastings.  Ribbed out early this year!\n-I noticed that many of the ribs I tasted were dry this year....weird!?!\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMy favorite competitors this year were Awsom Aussies, Checkered Pig, and Porky n Beans.  I chose them because their ribs stood out with mouthwatering sauce, meat falling-off-the-bone tenderness, noticeable smokerings, and overall taste.  Sadly I didn't have a chance to try this year's winning rib from Desperado's.  Damn lines!!!\n\nCan't wait till next year!  I smell a Labor Day UYE trip brewing up...",

One small signature salad and one large margherita pizza came to around $25, with free delivery. \n\nThe dressing for the salad came in a side cup, which was great because there were no soggy bits. Just fresh arugula, dried cranberries, gorgonzola and pine nuts. The pie, on the other hand, was definitely soggy. Some time in the oven helped significantly, but shouldn't delivery pizza be ready to enjoy when it arrives? \n\nNonetheless, I do like Slice and I'll give some of their other pies a try the next time we order.",

So when my parents moved away from Brandon and to Town n Country, I was glad to have this South Tampa location also.\n\nJust as I (probably) said in my Brandon location review, Green Island boba is THE BEST and my favorite! I always compare other places to Green Island, and rarely do the others ever win. They just know how to cook the tapioca just right and make the drinks with the correct flavors.\n\nThe only thing is that this location does not have frozen yogurt like Brandon. So you don't get to add some fro yo to your smoothie to make it creamier. They also have separate rewards cards, so you can't use the Brandon punch card at the Tampa store and vice versa.\n\nI feel bad for the girl who is all alone on her shift when I come in because I always roll in with friends and family aka almost 10 people. So she gets bombarded with our orders. Poor girl needs help! We always have to wait, so it's nice to have the games to entertain us.",

  "text": "This shuttle service was recommended by both the website for the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown hotel and the conference I was attending, so naturally I chose it when I got to the ground transporation counter (baggage claim) at PHL. Picked up at Terminal B/C first, and stopped twice more at the other terminals before leaving the airport, total of 6 passengers took awhile for everyone, at least an hour for me. The van itself was questionable - torn/ripped seats, empty chip bag on the seat, three pine-tree air fresheners, huge crack in the windshield, and the shakiest plastic parts (e.g. cupholders below windows) ever when In motion! Also, not sure if this is typical due to the relative location of the airport and the hotels, but the passengers who needed to get to residential addresses were dropped off first, and then the hotels. This made for an interesting drive through parts of Philly I probably would not have ventured to on my trip at all:  narrow streets, evasive driving maneuvers, double parking. A little plastic stool to help get in/out the vehicle topped it all off. Then again, it did only cost $10/person to Center City/University City so you get what you pay for I guess. I paid cash, and the only receipt provided was just a blank business card with a handwritten amount. Just saying, quite misleading and not what I expected especially based on the company website and recommendations. I did not choose to use Lady Liberty on my return trip to the airport, instead caught a cab.",

I'm still in awe. \n\nThe kind woman who cut my kid's hair put on Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood (they let you pick whichever show you want from Netflix, or, if you have an older child, they can also choose to play video games), and my child shut the heck up, sat still and let the woman cut his hair. Hooray for TV! Hooray for kid-centered hair-cutting places that have TVs, too!\n\nThis Cookie Cutters has a giant slide to play on while you wait, which was awesome because trying to get young children to wait patiently is ... let's just say it's very difficult. They also have a touch-screen game to play with, and a reading area with a chalkboard table, with lots of chalk and an eraser. There were several kids books available for one's reading pleasure, although I didn't see any kids in the reading area, because hello, there's a giant slide there that needs attention. Physical play almost always beats quiet reading time when you're younger than 5 years old.\n\nWe walked out of there with two haircuts for about $27 (not including tip), which is a little steep but worth it for our particular situation. (When you have a baby who will not tolerate haircuts, you will throw money at the situation just to get it taken care of.)\n\nOne interesting thing is that they do \"mommy and daddy\" haircuts here too, so if you're in need of a trim, you can get everyone looking tidy in one shot.",

  "text": "Performance Auto Group, otherwise known as Tampa Window Tinting on Google is the top rated window Tinter on Google with a 4.9 star rating and there is no mystery why. As summer time approaches, it's been so hot I needed to tint my car to protect the interior leather and stay cooler. They quoted me $60 under another shop for ceramic Tint and had an available time slot to install the tint the same day as I called on a Saturday! Ceramic tint is amazing because it provides 92 percent infrared heat reduction versus 50 percent heat reduction with a carbon or metallic Tint. For a 2 door sports coupe the metallic tint is only $120 but can cause degradation of phone, Bluetooth, and GPS signal. For $180 you can go with carbon tint that does not cause degradation of signal and gives 50 percent heat reduction. To step it up even more you can go with the ceramic film for $245 with Ceramic 92 percent heat reduction. The owner has a infrared gun to demonstrate the difference in heat with different tints when you slide it over and the ceramic is cool as a cucumber. So you know I was sold. Performance Auto group has an air-conditioned waiting area with leather couches, car magazines, free Wi-Fi, and a Blu-ray player where you can pick your movie while you wait. Performance Auto group is located off Hillsborough near i275 across from a family dollar, Performance Auto works complete auto repair, and 1 block from Howard ave. Performance Auto group also offers alarms, stereo upgrades, wheels and tires, hid upgrade kits, and led interior lighting upgrades. Installation only took 1 hour and the wait wasn't bad with their nicely equipped waiting room. All their tints come with a lifetime warranty against fading or bubbling. I highly recommend getting Tint with Performance Auto Group! It's definitely made a big difference and kept my car a lot cooler!",

Served to the brim in about a 20 oz cup, it was filled pretty close to the trim with a thick sweet vanilla syrup, a substantial balance of strawberry syrup and a cherry on top (literally). Heck, I'd be more than willing to overlook the extra ten cents they charge for the berry. Even the chicken burger is 4, 4.5 star territory. The portion is adequate for the price, and the seasoning has a mild kick to it. They listened to my opting out of mayo, and were generous with the BBQ sauce (very important for me.)\n\nHowever, I have to take a star and half off for the fries. The portion was small for the price, and the taste too plain almost as if they had  just refried frozen supermarket fries.\n\n4 Stars in total, since they get an extra 0.5 for the cute waitress on roller skates!",

My friend and I decided to come here spontaneously on a Friday night for dinner and we were seated right away. Little did we know it was \"Live Music Friday\" and we were about to get an amazing show! We intended to just come here for a bite to eat but ended up staying from around 6:30 until 9 pm to watch the live music. Shoutout to Birdsong & Paula Chavis they were amazing! They got the crowd singing along to tunes like Marvin Gaye's \"Let's Stay Together\" and other fun tunes, which we really enjoyed.\n\nI ordered the shrimp entree ($11.99) which you can choose grilled or breaded shrimp with two entrees. I got grilled shrimp tossed in the lemon pepper sauce with a side salad and sweet potato fries. My friend got the Nashville Hot Tenders ($9.99) with fries and a side salad as well. We both enjoyed our food but I wish they had given me more shrimp! It really wasn't a very big serving. The drinks were nothing too special. I got the Tennessee Lemonade which was just a spiked lemonade. My friend said her cocktail was okay but neither one of us was crazy about it. \n\nThe only reason I did not rate Woodfire Grille higher was the service. Although our server was nice he brought us our checks without asking if we were finished, then we had to tell him we actually wanted to order some post-dinner drinks and stay to listen to the music. After that, it took forever for our drinks to come out and our server said he was bartending and serving everyone which was crazy! It was definitely not his fault but I hope management reads this and knows to schedule more employees at peak time.",

The turtle soup is as good as everyone says, the pecan encrusted fish was dreamy, and the souffle was puffy and chewysweetspicy and I could eat it every day. The champagne and wine recommendations were crazy good. \n\nMost outstanding and noticeable of all is the quality of service at Commander's Palace. Nothing compares. Everyone who wants to work in service should train here. Every single person we walked by who works here in any capacity gave us an incredibly warm welcome like we were dear old friends and beloved regulars. Every person at our table of 10 received personalized recommendations and considerate, focused, attentive care. The way each course is served, with synchronized, balletic precision, is breathtaking but then the moment your plate is placed in front of you, your waiter checks in with you to make sure you have what you need in this distinctly Southern, friendly, unpretentious way that makes the choreographed moment so much sweeter. \n\nThe design of the original dining room took my breath away, and the garden room was lovely too. I'd love to eat at the table in the wine bunker someday, but since the president sat in the garden room I can't imagine who this even-more-exclusive room is reserved for... Beyoncé probably.

Here's what I ordered:\n\n1 oatmeal with:\nDried blueberries \nGranola\nPecans\nFlax seeds\nBrown sugar\nCinnamon\nWhole milk\n\n1 toasted strawberry poptart & a toasted cherry\n\n2 Juice boxes \n\n1 tea\n\nThe parking lot is bright at night time with well-lit lamps so if someone is snooping near your vehicle you can see them fairly clearly. The spots are numbered so you may park in front of your room conveniently.",

I thought this was just because of the heavy holiday weekend traffic but it looks like it's always like that from the pictures on their Yelp page. We waited in line, half way up it, people at the front of my group start yelling to the rest of us it's cash only. Do we all have enuogh cash? No. Some had no cash at all (me). So, we leave to go to an ATM, come back, start the line over again. My \"po boy\" is $13. Whatever.\n\nFood: I got the Shrimp Po boy and I will say they loaded up the shrimp, which was good. The bread was nothing special and the lettuce was like the shredded Subway stuff. Why on earth would anyone pay $13 for this? This place is just for tourists I think. I can't imagine why anyone who lived there would frequent this place.  \n\nPS- this might just be me being a total \"tourist\" but isnt a \"po boy\" the same thing as a \"sandwich\" Lol?",

We had to sort of stand by the bar and wait for a \"How's it going\" so that we ask to be seated.  The gentleman stated we could sit where ever we liked, so we opted for the bar.  First thing I noticed was that the bar was dirty and sticky.  Then, we were handed menus that looked as if they'd never been wiped down.  Additionally, my menu had an ant running around on it.\n\nAt this point, I was very reluctant to order, but because we had a direct line of sight into the kitchen, I decided to go for it.  The kitchen looked clean and in good order.  \n\nI ordered up an old fashioned to drink, and to eat I got the hummus platter as well as the chicken skewers.  The hummus platter was pretty good.  It's served with 3 types of hummus: black bean, regular and red pepper.  The pita chips are fried, and I found that a little weird, but they weren't bad, so I pressed on.  The chicken skewers had great taste, but they were dryer than the Mohave during the summer.  Had they been juicy, we could potentially be talking about some of the best around.\n\nLa Chica ordered duck wings, of which I took a few bites and wow.  Those jokers were tasty.  No gamey after taste either.  I highly recommend those above all else I sampled here.  Maybe bring some wet naps too just in case everything needs a quick wipe down.",

The new location is on Charlotte so it's much calmer than 12 South. I recognized the building right away because it very much resembles the 12 South building. The best thing is they have a big parking lot! You should have no problem finding a spot. \n\nWhen walking in, it's about the same setup as the other location. You grab a menu, walk up to the register, and order your food/drinks. You order individual tacos so you can try several different types. They take your name and then you sit wherever you like. I love the interior of this place. Very clean and simple but beautiful. I especially love the patio area. It's heated in the winter and it looks like in the warmer weather they can open the windows. \n\nWithin 5 minutes of sitting down our chips and queso came. My favorite part. Their queso is soooooooooooooo good. I dream about their queso. 2 minutes later, our tacos arrived. I always get the brisket tacos. So juicy and delicious. My boyfriend got the Memphis taco and an enchilada. The enchilada is smothered in a red sauce and cheese. Yum. Everything was so good and it's all at a great price. The staff is always really friendly and the owner has greeted us at both locations. I love love love this place and will for sure be a regular.",

Since I frequently find myself in need of gas and a bathroom when I'm in The East, I often come here. \n\nGas \n\nThis Shell branded station has a boatload of pumps. Don't let that make you think getting gas will always be easy, because it won't. Unless you come really early you're likely to find every pump occupied. I've also noticed a trend of folks getting gas and then abandoning their car while they go inside. This means I skip the station when it's full. Waiting for someone to return to their car is an exercise in frustration. \n\nBathroom\n\nThe bathroom here is awful. I'm not sure if it's lack of cleaning or just so many people using it. But it stinks and is never clean. Making matters worse is the lack of hand towels. All there is to dry your hands is an old hardly working hand dryer. Most of the time I wipe my hands on my pants. \n\nStaff\n\nThere are more workers here than almost any station in the city. They just sell their entire inventory daily as they're always restoring something. It's like an obstacle course to get a water or to pee. \n\nShould you go?\n\nIf you need gas and it's not packed, yes you should. If it's packed or you need to deuce it up, hell no you shouldn't.",

  "text": "I checked out Steam Boys for lunch yesterday, and I thought it was a decent lunch. I do think the menu is really limited: bao, dumplings, and soup. That seems like a lot of options maybe, but for bao, there's vegan and there's pork. And that's it. (They do offer steamed or fried bao.) They have a few lunch specials; I ordered the bao sampler lunch combo, which  is described as \"any two steamed bao and any seared bao\" for ($12.00). I was brought four bao (1 steamed vegan, 1 steamed pork, and 2 fried pork). The way I read the menu, I thought I was getting three bao, but maybe I read it wrong (or maybe I ordered paid for an extra; not exactly sure what happened). With tax and tip, it came out around $18, wasn't quite the deal I was expecting for a lunch combo, but definitely not a terrible price for lunch in Nashville. Of the bao I tried, the steamed pork bao was easily my favorite. The steamed vegan bao was pretty good - big chunky pieces of vegetables (napa cabbage, shiitake mushrooms) that were pretty flavorful. I definitely preferred the steamed to the fried, but that's just my preference generally (I like the texture of steamed bao better). It was an a-okay lunch: nice, casual eatery with plenty of seating, pretty quick service (you order at the iPad at the counter), and pretty good food. I liked it, and I'll probably come back with vegan friends and family (since I'm always on the hunt for vegan eats for them in Nashville), but I wasn't blown away by the menu or food. But there aren't a lot of places making bao in Nashville (I previously lived in Houston where bao are everywhere, it seemed), so if you're craving them, check out one of Steam Boys' locations (one in Donelson and one in Germantown).",

In it you can find demos of all Apple products, the \"genius\" bar and some of the best people watching this side of the Mississippi.\n\nProducts - If you're interested in becoming an Apple fanboy like me, you can play with all of Apple's latest devices in the store. Here is my one word review for some of teh products I played with:\n\n27\" iMac - Badass (bought one)\niPad Air - Badass (have the old pre-air, still badass)\nWatch - Dumb\niPhone 6Plus - badass (have one)\n\n\"Genius\" bar - This is where you go to get your device repaired when something goes wrong. Despite my fanboy status, I will admit that these things can, and do break. Depending on when you make an appointment (do this), your wait time will vary. I've waited as long as 45 minutes past my appointment and other times been seen right away. Appointments will usually remedy the situation and are free if it's under warranty. They are usually so efficient at fixing your device that I am considering paying for Apple care for my next device. My main issue with the \"genius\" bar is that this is the only place for miles where you can get a warranty repair done. Because of that, the place is often packed which leads me to the next part of my review.\n\nPeople watching - Oh. My. God. The Apple store attracts people from every nook and corner of society. If you like people watching like I do, just stand around towards the front of the store and enjoy. Here are a few of my favorites and the names I gave them:\n\nMoby - A man who looked remarkably like the singer sat across the packed store staring creepily at me for at least 30 minutes. Making matters worse was his legs spread as wide as humanly possible. Dude, no one wants to see your jort covered crotch.\n\nFull diaper baby - Hey lady, your kid has a diaper that is obviously filled with something. Having him crawl all over the table top is pretty gross.\n\nGutter punk - Dude, take a bath and stop wearing Capri pants. They clash with the anarchy patch on your jacket. \n\nThe end.",

  "text": "It's been ages since my last visit to Wing Chicx so I figured we'd give it a shot, especially to see how it would hold up against all the new KFC joints that have opened up lately. That and all my go to Korean places were closed Monday.\n\nL and I got there just before the rush and were able to snag a table. I don't know what Wing Chicx's deal is but either their layout is terrible or they need to train their staff better because we were asked to move once we had settled down along with another couple to make room for a larger group. Wouldn't have been an issue but the rest of service was terrible. It's a rarity that I complain about service but woooooooow, dreadful would be putting it nicely. \n\nThere were two waitresses working the front but they were running around like headless chickens. Or maybe they were hiding in the back, I have no idea. Sure, it was busy but it wasn't packed. I have no idea why/how it was so hard to take our order, re-fill our waters (that didn't happen), and to process our payment (had to ask multiple times for the bill). \n\n- Banchan - pretty standard stuff. They brought out kim chi, bean sprouts, braised potato and pickled daikon. The potato was the tastiest of the four side dishes. Good luck getting any refills.\n\n- Jap chae (#32) ($11.99) - pan stir fried sweet potato noodle with beef and assorted vegetables in their special soy sauce. My bud's never had jap chae before and I've never had Wing Chicx's take on this Korean staple so we ordered it. It was pretty average. I'm not a fan of the cabbage that they throw into the mix. Can't help but compare how much better Korean Grill's version was.\n\n- Original bulgogi beef (1D) ($16.00) - bulgogi beef with mixed vegetables marinated in Wing Chicx bulgogi soy sauce. Again, I wasn't very impressed. It was almost identical to their jap chae dish except that there was more beef and an unnecessary, excessive amount of cabbage. And seriously, what's with using the exact same vegetables? I know times are tough with increased food prices but yikes. At $16.00, our most expensive dish, I wouldn't order it again.\n\n- Chicken drumsticks ($10.99) - they were out of full chickens (we wanted to get half a chicken for $15.00) so we settled with their 6 piece drumstick option. These came out PIPING hot. You've been warned. The skin is hot, crispy and evenly battered while the inside is tender and juicy. Pretty good but you need to get a side of the sweet sauce to jazz up the flavours. We asked for extra sauce but that never came. Easily the best dish of the night and price is on point. I prefer their half chicken option as you get a variety of cuts and it just soaks up the sauce better.\n\n- Seafood pan fried pizza (8-S) ($12.99) - assorted seafood and mixed vegetables battered together and pan fried. It came without the vinegar soy sauce that usually accompanies seafood pancakes, which they didn't bring out until we were two thirds done. Of course, we weren't able to flag them down to tell them this so we gave up and ate it without. Sadly, It NEEDED sauce to save it. The pancake itself was mediocre. Lacked any crispy texture (read: kind of mushy) and the amount of seafood inside was laughable. \n\nPretty disappointing. This was one of those times where bad service really can affect your food experience. Food was above average but it's no longer on my list when I'm thinking of going out for Korean food. Too many choices these days to have to settle for mediocrity. If you go, make sure you order the dishes they're known for doing well and you should be okay.",

My boyfriend had their special fried rice which he liked, but they must have gotten their 'heat level' confused, because his ordered medium was extra fiery.\n\nService was just okay.

It wasn't too crowded, but the tables were packed.  Luckily, we walked in at the right time and a belly bar table opened up.  \n\nI really liked the ambience.  It's noisy, but not so bad that you have to yell at each other across the table.  It's everything I expect a hip whiskey/tequila drinking institution to be.  Couple that with delicious street style tacos, BAM I'm sold! \n\nService was excellent.  Our waitress was very sweet and offered lots of great suggestions.  Between the two of us, we got a couple drinks, Chips and Queso, and a few tacos each.\n\nThe Chips and Queso were yummy, but it got a little too heavy towards the end for me.  My boyfriend loved every last bite of it.  The chips were really addicting.\n\nAs for the tacos, we got Fish, Hongos, Pollo Rojo, Pork Belly Pastor, and Short Rib.  It's great that they make their corn tortillas in-house.  I loved loved loved the pork belly.  It was flavorful, slightly crispy, and cooked to perfection.  The short rib taco was delicious as well.  Highly recommended!  \n\nI also ordered the sangria which was made with rose and a moscato.  It was refreshing, but a  little too sweet for my taste (should've known with the moscato).  \n\nOther details:\n\nNot a huge restaurant, but they can accommodate larger groups if you plan in advance. \n\nClean bathrooms. \n\nPaid street parking.  Plentiful on a Tuesday evening, but may be a little difficult on weekends.\n\nLocated near tons of other shops, restaurants, and boutiques.\n\nOverall, I had a positive experience.",

  "text": "This was our first time here and I was surprised with the large, eclectic selection of furniture and home decor. They have a great selection of furniture for most homes from current trends through traditional. Every inch of the store has furniture, home accessories and accent pieces to compliment each room from ceiling to floor. \n\nWe were immediately greeted as we entered the store. The saleswoman was friendly and asked if we were looking for anything in particular. We weren't at the time but I love browsing furniture and home decor stores. I love getting decorating ideas and adding a few pieces to update my own space.\n\nUnfortunately when I did have a couple questions the salesteam was busy with others. I could have waited longer but they weren't life or death questions requiring answers that very minute. If I were purchasing I would have made a point to wait.\n\nPrices varied from average prices to overpriced. There was a nice sale going on when we were there. I'm going to be in the market for new sofas soon so I'm going to begin following their sales. The eclectic selection made browsing fun for me and I look forward to returning in the future.",

  "text": "My friends and I were visiting New Orleans for a service trip and wanted to try out a local brunch place and this came up on Yelp as very positively reviewed. We were staying in Chalmette, so the drive was a bit long but the food was well worth it. There was street parking (free and metered options) nearby, which was convenient. \n\nWhen we arrived, the restaurant was already packed, but luckily we were seated within a few minutes. In total, we ordered the pumpkin spice pancakes (one order  definitely serves 2 people), cheese grits, freshly squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice, and eggs creole, which were all scrumptious, hot, and fresh. \n\nThe service was quick despite the busyness of the restaurant, and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive.\n\nGreat place for brunch! Definitely worth a visit if you are (or even if you are not) visiting the Touro neighborhood!",

It certainly helped that I was with Boon, Grace, Fernelly and Rachel who are always entertaining..\n\nNate was friendly and helpful and I started off with a few samples. Didn't love the pomegranate (not pomegrantey enough) but the cookies and cream, coffee, yellow cake, and birthday cake were all good. The original tart wasn't the best I've had, maybe on the sweet side? but it was fine. The watermelon is SUPER interesting and fun. \n\nThe toppings are also very playful. lots of sweets like gummies, chocolate covered gummies, licorice strands, sour strips as well as fruit. The price seemed quite reasonable for what I got. The place was pretty busy even late and it's nice that it was open late enough for us to enjoy. Seating was comfortable and the decor is nice. Well lit. People were friendly. \n\nIf they had mochi and the blackberries were a lil better looking I would give it five stars. No WiFi also a lil disappointing. And I like fresh mango and kiwi toppings. Makes me believe I am being healthy.. But otherwise it's definitely a super fun place with a lot of variety, taste and fun. Definitely go with Boon, Rachel, Grace, and Fernelly if you can.",

This is my first visit to the Plainfield location which is directly in front of Mejiers on Dan Jones Road.\n\nThe hostess was pleasant with a warm greeting and I only had to wait a few minutes since I beat The lunch crowd. The restaurant has ample table and booth seating plus patio seating and first come counter seating. \n\nEverything on the menu is served all day from open to close. This is a great place for brunch whether you prefer breakfast, lunch or dinner. Friends and family can have a large omelette, creamy shrimp & grits to scrumptious chicken pot pie anytime of the day. And if you fancy a glass of wine, beer or mimosa with your meal then your in luck. I'm also happy to say they serve Coke products here.\n\nToday I ordered the Greek Omelette with feta cheese, black olives, tomatoes, spinach and I added mushrooms. They have always served generous portions of everything we've ordered and the omelette was no exception. It was stuffed with oddells of black olives, mushrooms, creamy feta cheese and fresh spinach. The serving of hash browns were the width of the plate and served with 2 slices of toast. I ended up taking half of my meal home for lunch later.\n\nThe service is always excellent from the hostess, the servers and even the bussers.\n\nIf you're looking for good comfort food in a pleasant atmosphere with good service then definitely give Metro Diner a try.",

My friend said their lobster bisque was really good too, though that one was gone from the menu as well.  \n\nWhile this doesn't look like a place for great fish and chips, without any crab shack or pub vibe, they were amazingly good. For starters they use New England cod, and the batter was light and crunchy. The fries are really delicious too. Portions are very generous.",

It's always quiet, never crowded, and therefore a convenient place to go for a quick bite. \n\nThe hummus is good, the lentil soup is pretty awesome, and they've got a miniature version of the huge store that's part of the original location on Banks Street. You can buy stuff like a pint of jordan almonds (which I can eat in a matter of days, they're awesome) and random European items like Kinder eggs (which I believe are from Germany).  \n\nLocated in the middle of the Frenchmen Street hubbub, it's easy to walk by Mona's without even realizing it's there. Once you walk in, though, it's surprisingly large and makes you feel like you've been transported to, I don't know, somewhere other than Frenchmen Street.

I regret eating the calories. \n\nThe wait staff was unfriendly too, seemed like they were too good to serve me breakfast, or take my money.

After standing there for a few more seconds and realizing she was done with me, I left. \n\nI don't want to say they were racist, but, I was definitely the only non-white patron there, and everyone else was getting chatted up. \n\nAnyway, I won't be returning.

  "text": "First, absolutely nobody calls this place the \"Improv Comedy Center.\" \n\nWhy is Tampa Improv listed this way here on Yelp? It makes it tougher for people who want to go here and see reviews to find the right page. (Perhaps the ownership or management of Tampa Improv can reach out to Yelp and tell them to change it)\n\nI have been coming here since the venue originally opened as part of Centro Ybor's redevelopment plan to change the way people in Tampa thought about Ybor City.\n\nThat plan obviously didn't work and with the exception of Tampa Improv, the movie theater and Tampa Bay Brewing Company, virtually every other business originally opened as part of Centro Ybor predictably failed. Much like the damn trolley that nobody rides either. That stupid thing should disappear so the city of Tampa can open up more lanes for people in actual cars to drive between Ybor and Amalie Arena. \n\nIt is a credit to Tampa Improv that they have survived the failed Centro Ybor concept.\n\nPersonally, I have always been able to count on Tampa Improv for a consistent experience and affordable night out with friends. My interactions with management and employees in the box office have also been nothing but positive.\n\nMy most recent visit with a group was to see Al Romas on Wednesday, June 14th. Al never disappoints and all of us laughed openly from his performance. Yes, I've seen him a few times over the years and truly appreciate how Al interacts with the crowd. He also doesn't simply use profanity as a punch line to try and get a laugh...which is such a crutch these days for comics when they don't really have a joke to tell.\n\nAl had to work even harder on this particular night because the so-called \"comedian\" that opened for him completely mailed it in and did not want to perform. This opening act  basically admitted his lack of interest as he took the stage to fill 20+ minutes and verbally condemned the smaller Wednesday crowd.\n\nSo, I guess it is our fault that we showed up and the rest of Tampa did not? Dude, if you don't want to perform, do us a favor and don't take the gig or the paycheck. I'm sure you can find someplace else in Ybor to get more high than you already are and let the rest of us get our money's worth from comedians who give a damn about doing a quality show.\n\nCustomer service at Tampa Improv is good. Sure, there are minimums per person, but that's part of attending any comedy club I've ever visited and the drink prices aren't anything that ridiculous. I pay roughly $5 for a bottle of domestic beer and that's in line with what most bars charge around the Tampa Bay Area when it isn't happy hour or a posted special. Parking in the garage two blocks south is only $1 per hour and it is an easy walk as long as you don't step on the roosters or the hobos along the way.\n\nFunny to me how people here on Yelp complain that the tables are too close to one another at Tampa Improv. These are some of the same hypocrites who wax poetic about the atmosphere at Bern's where the floorplan in the dining room is about as spacious as riding a Subway train after leaving a World Series game at Yankee Stadium.",

  "text": "A wonderful place to visit for all ages. It is a volunteer ran facility that serves as a retirement sanctuary for big wild cats and some smaller felines as well. Do not be deceived, this is not a petting farm. You cannot take photos close up with the animals nor can you touch them. These are large untrained cats that are here to rest and spend their golden years. It is a beautiful place for them to call home as many of them were abused and mistreated in their prime. The staff here is fantastic. There are different tours you can choose from, some more hands on than others.\n\nWe began our Day Tour promptly after we sat through a safety and informational video. Each guest was given a headset unit that plays each cat's story as we see them on the tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable as well.We were able to see several different lynxes, cougars, bobcats, tigers, lions and servals. Many of them were kept in circuses or bred for hybrid pet collectors. Some were declawed and had no way to go back into the wild. It was very sad to hear their stories. Fortunately, now at BCR, they are able to relax and be at one with nature. Each area for each cat is rather large. There is a fence around them to keep them separate as big cats are solo animals and do not play well with other unfamiliar big cats, however, there is plenty of space in each fenced area for them to run, jump and lounge around. In addition to that, they have special 'vacation' areas that they rotate the cats around every couple weeks so they can get a change of environment. \n\nYou end the tour back at their gift shop where you can purchase something as a form of donation to BCR. All proceeds do go back to the animals. Great place to learn and give back to the animals.",

They don't know from brunch, and they close before happy hour; so don't bookmark it for your weekend morning meal, nor try to stop in after work.  This is a 7 to 3:30 corner grill that had a few dozen thick scrapple slices frying to a dark brown while I drank their Ellis Coffee and awaited my first taste of their french toast.  \n\nThe house has about a dozen tables in two rooms and eight spinning stools along the counter that overlooks the chef workspace.  It was about half full of neighborhood personalities who seemed to know each other as they were greeted by name.  The server, a lovely young woman who is Kitty's niece, took care of me, and filled me in on the history of the institution, open since 1952! \n\nYes. It looks its age, with family photos on the walls, and original floors, walls and stools.  Either you get the deeply rubbed in culture here, or you don't. With its gritty charm and surprisingly good food, it is easy to develop a crush on Kitty, and want to visit her often. She is as authentic as the day is long.  My three slices of thick egged toast were very good.  A little sweet from the vanilla and sugar in the mix, and a little crispy on the edges where the hot steel melted that sugar and left its hardened residue.  They know how to do FT here. $5.50 was a happy price. The java was strong and a little rough (bitter), but nothing to complain about. Again, her Joe is straight up Bunn-O-Matic.  No expresso options with Kitty. \n\nKitty's is very close to I-95, and an easy on/off if you want to stop before reaching Center City from the north. Not sure she could handle becoming a hit on the breakfast bookmark circuit, especially on weekends, so if you want to check her out, come on a weekday morning when the regular crowd is thinner.  \n\nBut, if you like hard stop traditional breakfast without any frills, give this old girl a go.",

The funny thing is that the sushi chef during my recent visit was the exact same chef during my very first visit! Definitely great service from this chef. I can't recall my first visit very well but I remember being more than satisfied. During my more recent visit, the wait for dinner was about 45 minutes which was pretty long. I think they wait until the people currently sitting at the sushi bar all clear out before they seat the next set of AYCE folks in which they serve for a set of folks for one hour, wait until they clear out and then fill up the seats again so it's kinda like waves of people at the sushi bar. However despite the wait, the rolls here are pretty darn tasty and you just want to try them all! This time around, I tried:\n\nCeviche Roll: Surprisingly good! I thought this roll cold have been a hot mess of raw fish with lemon and cilantro but it was just really good. It tastes just like ceviche with rice which doesn't really sound that good but all of the fish and citrus flavor work well as a roll. \n\nMountain Roll: The crab topping is just too sweet for me. Otherwise, this would have been a great roll.  \n\nDragon Roll: A very hearty roll if you will. The combination of crystal shrimp and unagi make this roll almost meat-like as opposed to seafood like. I really liked that quality of this roll. \n\nRing Roll: A yummy roll especially with the basil sauce. \n\nKokopelli Hand Roll: Reminds me of honey walnut prawns minus the walnuts, wrapped in seaweed. It may be good to others but too creamy and heavy for me. \n\nSeaweed Salad: The salad isn't too oily and comes in a big ol' serving. \n\nBaked Mussels: Do yourself a favor and order this first thing since they take 15 minutes to be made. The mussels are excellent! The chef can make em spicy by adding a jalepeno slice and sriracha on top of each mussel which gives them a hot kick.  \n\nDessert: Green tea ice cream and Mango sorbet were the options during dinner. I went with the Mango sorbet, which the chef gives plenty of. It was a bit on the sweet side, but what the heck, it comes with the meal. \n\nThe waitresses do a good job of coming around to clear your plates and re-fill your beverages. Overall a great dining option, especially if you're craving sushi in Reno!",

Everyone should do this as much as possible. Besides that , I love browsing  in this store, and sometimes I get caught up and buy other things too. On my recent visit I bought a little monkey pipe . It had an eye on it so I knew I had to have it . Anything with an eye on it , I snatch up. Could be the Greek in me:-) I love it . It so small, cute, and gets the job done well. On my way out,  I was browsing the chronic pops, and the guy who runs the place, that let me add, is always very helpful & nice when I come in, told me to take a couple and let him know what I think . That was very nice of him. Thank you! I'll be back when in need of more Sage. Got to keep those ghosts at Bay.",

When the service department answered, I asked about Saturday times. Unless I was leaving my car with them, they didn't have anything available until 3pm. I was fine with that. \n\nWhen I arrived at 3pm, I was told that they'd get my car in as soon as possible. I'm fine with waiting a bit, I'm a patient soul.

We have always enjoyed it. \n\nIt was not too busy and we were told to have a seat where we liked. We chose a booth along the wall. The booth on my side of the table felt like the cushion was gone in the middle and my chin was on the table. I just moved a bit toward the wall, but my wife commented to me not to lean against the wall. I looked and it appeared to not have been cleaned in a while. There were all sorts of different colors and specks on it. I wish I took a picture but I did not.  The remainder of the restaurant looked clean but the booths along the side of the restaurant should be ripped out and replaced. \n\nThe server brought us menus and took our drink orders. We were familiar with the menu since we have been to their other location. I chose the enchiladas lunch special and my wife likes their chimichangas so she ordered that. \n\nOur food arrived in a timely manner and looked yummy and the server was attentive. We enjoyed our meals and appreciated the fast service since we had to get back to work. \n\nOverall a good experience but next time we will definitely not sit in the booth.",

Latkes are fluffy and a good balance for all the pastrami in the sandwich. I felt like there was too much pastrami in the sandwich.

  "text": "Years ago, before the birth of many microbreweries, Saint Somewhere used to be in a warehouse. They would pour you some beer after you paid for a tour, as they couldn't sell beer and most certainly did not have a taproom.  \n\nThree weeks ago, Saint Somewhere finally moved to their new location, inside a historic home right in downtown Tarpon Springs.  It's a lovely blue building, with a small front courtyard and a two rooms for enjoying your beer.  Unlike most breweries, and befitting their historic building status, they keep the interior homely and reminiscent of an earlier age, with fading photos (apparently some are of their ancestors.)  Upstairs will be guest rooms, as a new form of B&B - Beer and Bed.  Isn't it how things were hundreds of years ago?  \n\nWhen we visited today, their beers are still fermenting after the move and won't be available for another week or two. They therefore offer several Belgian ales on tap, as well as some of their own brews, plus cider, non-alcoholic tonic water etc. in bottles and cans.  When fully operational, there will be 10 drafts.\n\nIt's great to grab a beer and sit inside by the big window for people watching.  Or sit outside by in their little yard.  Right next door is KC Cue, a great bbq place for grabbing some award winning ribs or pulled pork.  \n\nThey don't do flights, so the beers come in a full pour at around $6-8. They are nice enough to let you sample their beers, in the cutest miniature beer glasses though.",

Therefore, this review is purely based on my takeout experiences.\n\nIf you couldn't figure from the name, they offer a wide selection of pizzas.  Like most places, you can order a few standard menu options or create your own.  Unlike most places, I think a few of their standard menu items are a bit different (in a good way).\n\nMy go to is the Capricciosa: Mozzarella, Prosciutto Cotto, Artichokes, Mushrooms, and Kalamata Olives. They don't go cheap on the toppings. The sauce is solid and the crust not too thick not too thin.  \n\nBeyond Pizza, they have an extensive menu, however, I have stuck with pizza my visits to this point.  Staff interactions have been minimal, but friendly.  Honestly, I am excited to check out their patio and enjoy more of their pizza.",

You walk through the kitchen into a room full of bright colors. There's a bar upfront and some outdoor seats to the side of the main dining area. It gets absolutely packed and they don't take reservations for parties under 5, so be prepared.\n\nMy favorite dish may have been the fried eggplant appetizer with an oyster cream sauce and mushrooms. I'm a sucker for any cream sauce but this was amazing. Perfectly cooked eggplant smothered in a rich seafood based sauce, amazing. \n\nMy friend ordered the eggplant perogue with shrimp, oysters, and fish in a cream sauce. She loved it but the sauce had some kind of cheese in it and I'm just not a fan of seafood and cheese.\n\nI ordered the Godzilla, a seasonal special of fried softshell crab over fried green tomatoes with remoulade and a side of slaw. I'm not usually a fan of softshell crab (I know, I know) but this was the best I've ever had. The fried green tomatoes were on the soggy side, that may have been due to the remoulade or the crab sitting on top of them, I'm not sure but I left them alone in favor of their amazing slaw! Our entrees came with two sides and a salad. Unknown to us the salad also comes with a fried oyster. Why don't all salads come this way? \n\nService was beyond fantastic, our waiter was extremely patient while we struggled to make our choices. Their Fi Na Ye and watermelon margarita drinks are delicious. Their creme brulee is also a winner. Check them out!",

On the plus side, service was very friendly - everyone I interacted with was genuinely nice, and they were offering some samples outside the bakery. The location by the river is also lovely, and there is a nice outside seating area. They also accept credit cards now.\n\nI tried the mango mousse and the clafoutis, which were $5.50 each. The mousse was ok, very light and not too sweet, but the sponge beneath was more like a grainy wet cookie. The custard portion of the clafoutis was ok - very eggy and barely sweet - but I didn't like the tough crust underneath or the very bright and artificial cherries. I hope these two are exceptions and that the rest of the large selection is better, but I don't think I'll be stopping by again the next time I'm in the area.",

It was such a great choice. The weather was perfect so we had the privilege of sitting outside. I went ahead and ordered their Red Sangria. It was pretty good but not really worth it. I should have just ordered something with whiskey in it. Whiskey and Tacos synergies pretty well on the palette. The Sangria was more like a \"meh\" overpriced cocktail than sangria. Who cares, let's get to the noms. \n\nNow, as I age like fine wine from the south of France I crave the presence of tacos in my diet. No joke. Young Aaron B used to say, \"Tacos, meh?\" A wiser Aaron B emerged through the flames of the Yelperverse and now craves what the hip youth might call, \"bitchin' tacos.\" \n\nI went ahead and ordered 1 Fried Tilapia, 1 Chorizo, and 1 Breakfast Taco (egg+bacon+Cheese). I saw they had street corn so, of course, I had to order it. It all came out in a timely manner along with about 7-8 other orders. Granted, we were like the only ones there on an early Wednesday evening. Any who, the tacos were great. They aren't the best tacos around but they are pretty damn good. The Fried Tilapia was pretty spot on. Not as good as Milagro or Mission taco but I could go still go ham on a bucket of them. The Breakfast Taco was also legit. I loooove breakfast tacos. The least favorite of my 3 was the chorizo but it was still good! They were all cooked perfectly, came out warm, and were the perfect size. \n\nThe street corn deserves its' own paragraph break. It was sooooo good. If you are a corn fanatic I highly recommend trying it. I don't even know how to describe it besides amazing. It comes out on a stick, roasted, with a sweet-ish-red seasoning, cheese crumbles, sour cream (?), and idk what else but just get it. It is the knees of the bees. \n \nI highly recommend checking out Atomic Cowboy. It's a great place to grab a drink and some grub. I hear they have an awesome brunch.

  "text": "This is one of those times where I'm like, \"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place\", but honestly, I loved it so much that I'd write it over and over again if needed. I mean, who doesn't love ranch dressing? And, well, if you don't think is not the place for you.\n\nI found myself in St. Louis and had been looking all over for random places to try. A friend of mine came up with this suggestion at the advice of a friend. I said, \"how could this be bad with ranch in the title?\" \n\nThe biggest issue with dining here really was finding street parking. Well, also, the place is packed, but you can make it work like we did by sitting at the bar. Believe me, they can fit a lot of plates on that bar because we went to town on some food.\n\nAlso, I'd like to add- if you don't like French fries you're going to 1) be missing out 2) I guess order onion rings because how do you not get French fries with ranch dressing?\n\nOkay, so the main attraction in my opinion, and I have to be in the majority here is the ranch this country flight. For $13 you get a mountain of fries and 13, yes 13 different type of ranch of your choosing. They have like 30 total so believe me, it's difficult. Not a glutton like us? Well you can do the ranch this country flight for $5 which has your choice of 5 ranch flavors.\n\nSome of the flavors include: Twisted Ranch (original), Asian Zing, Avocado, Carter's Smoke (Smoke Paprika), Buttermilk Basil, Greek, Jack the Ripper (Pepper Jack), It Takes 2 to \"Mango\", Pesto, Red Billy Goat (Red Peppers & Goat Cheese), Roasted Garlic, Southwest, Ruffalo (Roasted Garlic & Buffalo), and Smoke Tomato Basil just to list off some of the choices.  The flight comes on essentially a lazy Susan that spins around delightful ranch dressing. The amount of fries is almost absurd. But the fries and every ranch dressing were delicious.\n\nBeing me, I got even more fries with my patty melt style burger which was cooked exactly how I wanted it to be, but again, you almost don't come here to eat anything other than ranch, but please do because the food was quality even if it is under the shadow of that ranch dressing which we were told was made in house.\n\nThe service was great. The staff behind the bar were super friendly and chatted with us a lot while we ate. It was a great experience. Something I didn't know I needed in my life and a place I have to get back to. It's one of those places you'd travel there just to go to, well, at least if you love ranch dressing as much as I do. And the prices are so unbelievably cheap too. It's definitely a win.",

Then of course, I consulted Yelp and low and behold, Paul had a mere 2 reviews. So I decided I wanted to blaze a new trail (i.e. try spot that doesn't host 50+ reviews); they only recently opened after all. When the gays decided it was high time for a classy, self-affirming team dinner, I quickly offered up Paul. They were understandably confused since they thought I was bringing new bait (named Paul) to dinner...\n\nThe interior is bright, airy, and *gasp* not cramped (as many BYOs are known to be). Sure, it's small, but they're not forcing communal dining to accommodate more guests. The menu is inventive but accessible; I'm used to going to fancy restaurants where I'm asking the server for a translation- this isn't the case here. Halibut, chicken breast, scallops, oysters, duck...they make it sound much better, but they cover the basics and offer something for any omnivore. \n\nI had the pancetta wrapped halibut. I recently started eating fish, so my palate is still in development, but this dish left me considering dropping red meat altogether. Perfectly flavored and generously portioned! I was expecting a thin filet, but what arrived was at least 10oz! I highly recommend ordering it, or at least convincing someone at your table to order it so you can steal a bite.\n\nAfter your meal, you'll want to open another bottle, chat up Effie and your server, and close the place down. You'll instantly feel at home. As for the name, the BYOB is named after Effie's late father, Paul. It goes without saying, but he'd be pretty proud.",

  "text": "Ike's has an open, spacious and somewhat modern feel. It is comfortable and cosy, with several couches and lounge chairs and even bamboo plants. North facing on Speedway, you get a gorgeous view of the Catalinas, albeit interrupted by Speedway traffic. Still, the tall windows here are wonderful.  \n\nThe menus is pretty straightforward. The cafe sells breakfast all day, which is pretty awesome! Try the veggie scramble. Meateater or not, this is an awesome meal and a good deal. The Super BLT is meh. I was disappointed to find way too much turkey and not enough turkey bacon. But the hummus plate also is a good treat, and they also sell granola and oatmeal. \n\nI have been spending time here studying, and have found that the password-protected free WIFI can be spotty. The staff is working to fix it and, really, it was much improved this time. And I love a place that actually uses its air conditioner during the summer months. Nothing like a bead of sweat running down your back when you're focusing on your theory. \n\nBut feminists and women's studies majors be forewarned -- Ike's has a very strong firewall. So, if you are studying anything related to sexuality and fluid sexual identities, you may not be able to access the sites and resources you need. \n\nI tried a couple of times and was barred access, receiving -- instead -- an intimidating black and red full-screen banner indicating that I was barred from viewing such things. As if pointing a big, red finger saying, \"You! Yes, you! No, you are not allowed to read 'The structure of sexual orientation and its relation to masculinity, femininity, and gender diagnosticity: Different for Men and Women' on these premises! Take that somewhere else.\"",

I am now remorseful for not returning sooner. \n\nThere are about 40+ vendors offering all sorts of goodies. Ranging from clothing for women and men, to hand made soaps, posters, candies, candles and so much more. One vendor offers some very creative and tasteful stationary. I'm a sucker for note cards and thank you cards. \n\nNext time you are downtown, make it a point to stop by and shop this \"Collective\" boutique. Chances are you will find something to your liking. I did. I love my new poster/map that shows all the neighborhoods in Saint Louis. Now I know where all the Yelp Dukedoms are located.

  "text": "Being such a nice and genuinely awesome guy, I'm starting this review by looking out for you. How so? Well, if you were planning to, for example, go to Xu Hue on a Wednesday, you would be in for major disappointment (like a certain someone that tried to go during supper time). Yep, they are only open from 11am to 4pm so you've been warned!\n\nThe following week, I went to Xu Hue on a Tuesday evening for dinner with three friends and this time, they were open for business. The place is your typical Asian restaurant - hard seats, white walls, TV (U.S. Open on - win!) and random Asian decorations. I'm pretty sure if the seats are hard and uncomfortable, you know the food will be good. Just a tip I've picked up over the years.\n\nA good Viet buddy of mine recommended Xu Hue as they are known for having several local/regional dishes that are hard to find in other Edmonton Vietnamese restaurants. So, with that, we decided to order a couple appetizers to share:\n - Green onion cakes ($4.50 for two) - these were surprisingly delicious. Add some of their chili hot sauce to it (which was also awesome - definitely had some good heat to it). We devoured these like they were going out of style.\n - Banh xeo ($6.95) - apparently these pan fried Vietnamese crepes are super hard to find in town. Comes with a side of lettuce and fresh basil. It was very crunchy and the inside consisted of bean sprouts, shrimp and sliced pork. Also came with a fish sauce to dip with. I was expecting the banh xeo to be delicious but we all concluded it was very average. Not bland but just very ordinary.\n - 2x Bun bo hue (spicy) ($9.95) - two friends ordered this and it looked/smelled delicious. They both were big fans.\n - Five colour vermicelli ($10.95) - spring rolls, pork, shrimp, beef and chicken.\n - Fish sauce noodle soup (spicy) ($9.95 large) - I ordered this dish. The broth was on the sweeter side compared to other pho places. As well, the broth tasted much more subtle, almost cleaner if that makes sense. I overheard the owner saying that there is no MSG in it, which I like. I also really liked the noodles - they were different from the normal rice noodles you get. Yum.\n\nSolid pho place in Chinatown with a lot of interesting/different dishes on their menu. To quote Tom Haverford, \"Treat yo' self\".",

It's a pain in the behind, on occasion, specifically when you've only got a credit card. \n\nOtherwise, this place is your run-of-the-mill gas station in a possibly iffy neighborhood, the kind with bulletproof glass between you and the person taking your money. \n\nI've been here a couple times, for no reason other than it happened to be convenient to wherever I was when I decided that my gas light had been on for long enough, and I was forced to give in and refuel. Though I did have to go inside, I didn't bother to look around much, so didn't notice anything worth sharing with regard to their selection of candy/cold drinks/miscellaneous gas station crap, but I didn't notice the aroma of fried food, so it's not one of the gas stations where you can get fried chicken and that kind of stuff.\n\nAnd yes, I realize this is an elaborate gas station review.

  "text": "When you go in to watch the Wildcats play UCLA and you get a seat (for six) right away, I'd say that's a pretty decent start to the night. Yep, they have the bible of beers and more at this joint and quite frankly, that's way too many options than I personally care for, but that's no reason to knock off a star or two. The more beer the the merrier, right!?  We also had pretty good and attentive service. Was our server a beer connoisseur? No, but she tried and was quite nice. Plus, they have a giant beer book at each table so you can brush up on key words and definitions. We ordered some bites to keep us sober. I had pretty basic expectations of the food...and basic it was. Nothing spectacular, just your typical bar fare (hummus, pretzel, tater tots), served warm and in a timely fashion. I was under the impression that this was a great place to watch a game. I wouldn't say it was great, but there were plenty of TVs, albeit in odd locations. But best of all they played the sound! I'd almost give fourth star for that...but really, this place, while it has an insane beer list, doesn't have much of a draw for me. It feels cold and corporate inside. One staff member mentioned they may start hosting free beer classes as they do their Phoenix store, and I highly encouraged him to pass the word onto management, that they should! I think it might be a good way to engage with our local beer loving community.",

  "text": "While many of the great original businesses of channelside plaza have failed and closed, splitsville and hooters remains open since day one and still bring a good crowd of people.  We came for a company outing to splitsville in the once legendary hot spot, channelside plaza, in downtown tampa, on the water, now a much less popping area, but not quite a ghost town. Back in splitsville's hay day they had a dance floor in the back, live dj playing some great music, and the place was always the place to be on the weekend and you needed bowling reservations at least a week in advance. Now it's more of a low key, kid friendly, chill spot with pg rated music, to gather and bowl in an upscale atmosphere with a group of friends. Splitsville wasn't packed like it used to be, but it wasn't empty either. I'd say 4 out of 12 bowling lanes were open. The good thing is that you have a good chance of walking in without reservations and getting a bowling lane, although I'd definitely recommend reservations for large parties or just to be sure. If Id compare Splitsville to their experience 10 years ago, id give it 3 stars but if i compare Splitsville to other bowling alleys in Tampa, id have to say Splitsville is the most modern and upscale bowling alley in the entire tampa bay area with the best food too. \n\nWe had a large variety of surprisingly good sushi, chicken tenders, pepperoni pizza, and veggie pizza. Service was good and it was a decent atmosphere although not as lively as it had been in the years in the past. Now that Thai Thani moved out due to demolitions, splitsville is the last remaining place to get sushi. If you live downtown by channelside, I'd definitely recommend their sushi! Our food came out in under 20minutes but it was no rush since we were busy bowling. Probably the biggest negative about going anywhere in channelside is paying for parking. I was surprised to see that the bucs teams, lightning teams, Dave attel, and even Rihanna have visited and all signed bowling pins on display under glass. They've had quite a few famous people roll through! The pictures are classic 1950s post world war 2 mad men style and very nastalgic. Will add more about the sushi we got later!",

  "text": "The most amazing Caribbean food I've ever tasted hands down. Brought me back to my trip to the Caribbean and was home style all homemade foods. \nCame here after my sister found this place on Yelp. Thanks yelp! \n\nWalked up to the store front and it looked like a small take out joint- walked inside and was welcomed by a smiling face and a warm welcome. The menu had so many tasty Caribbean choices on it- I didn't know what I wanted to get. \n\nI ended up getting a jerk chicken platter/ the kind and welcoming cashier gave us a tip about the jerk chicken and said to get mild if you're not used to spice. So got the mild jerk chicken with rice, and sweet potatoes. \n\nMy sister got some other chicken with Mac n cheese and green beans. While my mom got a Cajun shrimp salad. I also got a side of mango chutney so it could sweeten up the spice. \n\nThere is some seating in the restaurant but not very many. We pushed some tables together and sat and watched the Hobbit movie that was playing on the large tv. \nThe food was done quickly and we all dug in. No one talked for about 25 mins- all I heard was ooo and yum and wow this is good... as well as some heavy breathing and panting for the fact that the mild still bad some spice to it. My mouth was on fire but I was loving it! The food was amazing and mouth watering! My mouth and lips seriously got numb but I didn't care I kept on tearing it up! \n\nThe mango chutney helped the spice a lot and the rice also did. I tried my sisters Mac n cheese and it was the cheesy and most delightful meal within itself. The portions here are hefty but do not break your pocket! \n\nI ended up having leftovers which I later devoured two days later and it tasted just as good. I ordered two sandwiches to go- 2 jerk chicken sandwiches with Mac n cheese for my brother and he was raving about how amazing it was and for the price. \nThe cashier told us that they have special bread on Saturday's so it looks like ok going back tomorrow to get my fill. \n\nI highly recommend this Caribbean place! If you want some tasty food that's made on sure from scratch with a little spice- this place is for you!",

There is plenty of outdoor seating as well as plenty of room in the dining room, the bar area, and what appeared to be a private dining room.\n\nThe service was really attentive and friendly, even holding the door for us to enter!  \n\nMy wife seemed to enjoy her Buttermilk Cobb salad which was rather large, even though she ordered the smaller version.  Lots of tasty ingredients cut down to decent sizes so that she didn't need make additional cuts.\n\nI have been hearing about the Black Bean Burger for awhile now, so I decided to give it a try and upgraded my side to Onion Rings.  The Burger had a nice flavor, somewhat less spicy than I expected from reading the ingredient list.  The \"burger\" was full sized and moist...maybe a little too moist since chunks of patty dropped out of the bun when I lifted it.  Fortunately, there was a fork handy to pick up the fallen parts.  The onion rings were lightly breaded and the onion inside was very sweet.  The house made ketchup paired well and is highly recommended.\n\nWe also decided to share the Peach White Chocolate Bread Pudding with pecans and whipped cream.  Very delicious and just the right size for sharing after a full meal.\n\nReview #385",

For my dinner, I ordered a ginger salad, tuna tataki, and a soft shell crab roll. The $5 salad came out first and consisted of lettuce with two tomatoes in a ginger dressing. Hmm, not impressed.\n\nMeanwhile, I could see the young, clearly new sushi chef struggling to make my tuna tataki.  But I don't blame him for it being so terrible, I blame the head chef, who could CLEARLY see the young man had no idea what he was doing, come over, change something, walk away for 2 minutes (to aimlessly wander the empty restaurant) then wander back and change something else.  When the final product was served, it was terrible. Not only was it NOT tuna tataki, but it had huge pieces of sea salt on it, making it inedible. Fortunately, when I returned it, it was taken off my bill.  \n\nI did like the flavor of my soft shell crab roll, but my personal preference is not to eat huge rolls cut into just five pieces; I like when the roll pieces are bite-sized, and there are more of them. I found myself taking out the soft shell crab and eating it separately, then squishing the rest of the roll together to eat it.\n\nIt was not an enjoyable meal, and I doubt I will return.",

  "text": "You know that the mall has fallen when you see Burlington Coat Factory as an anchor store.\n\nThis used to be the go-to mall in the whole Indianapolis metro area.  It had everything you could possibly want and while it was crowded, you could find your way to shop, even on Friday or Saturday night.\n\nNow, it doesn't seem there is much of a reason to keep the doors open.  West 38th Street is craptacular and you have to be more aware of your surroundings.  It's not unusual, though.  Malls all over the U.S.A. are declining, partly due to online shopping.  Anchor stores are going away, due to consolidation.\n\nIf a mall isn't owned by General Growth, Simon, or Westfield, it's not likely getting enough money to thrive and they're likely to focus on areas where people have money, and it's not this neighborhood.  People will head to Greenwood Park Mall or Keystone or even Castleton Square and you can't blame them.",

This isn't even considered chicken fried rice, it's just flavorless rice with dry chicken and peas. \n\nThe chicken vindaloo wasn't actually vindaloo, not sure what paste they used but they didn't cook the potatoes all the way through. Which is sad, because we were the only people there and our order took 40 mins to come our. \n\nThe naan was a non issue. Didn't even try it. It was cold and I'm 99% sure this is the same stuff they sell in the frozen section at Wegmans. \n\nIt's hilarious that this place is called \"Indian Restaurant\", it's anything but a Indian restaurant.",

  "text": "We came here early on a Saturday night after the place we really wanted to try was inexplicably closed. Somehow we walked in just in time to score the next to last booth. The smells were pretty enticing right from our entrance, and from all directions we saw patrons really enjoying their food.\n\nThere were a few apps that sounded interesting, in the spirit of diplomacy I agreed to sharing the ricotta fritters. They were really good too, a blend of a few different cheeses with perhaps just a bit of risotto to help bind them, the garlic aioli was perfect too. But next time the meatballs will be my choice( more on that soon)\n\nWe each decided to choose our own pies of the smaller size, hoping that the other would be open to sharing a slice. Trish selected a special of the evening, white Brussels sprout with pancetta. She asked for it to be cooked less crispy than she noticed other tables pies were. It was a solid white too, lots of meat but lacking in the sprout department. I think another sharper cheese other than mozz may have pleased me more. She really enjoyed it, and the thin crust too. This crust has a slightly sourdough taste, the bottom holds up well to toppings, at the same time the outer crust, though it may look burnt, still has a nice chew to it.\n\nThis was evident in my Carni, pepperoni, sausage and meatballs. I asked them to cook as they normally would, and I was alright with the slight burn marks. The red sauce was flavorful, and the toppings were great. In the future I would probably skip the pepperoni, not because it wasn't good, but due to its small shape, all the pieces curled up off the pie and became too crispy. I was tempted to point this out to our waitress but after a few bites I decided the rest of the pie was too good to send back. The sausage was very good, and this is an item I use to gauge many places. Better yet was the meatball, super tender and parmy. I'm usually not thrilled with meatballs on my pie, this was probably the best I've had on one.\n\nThe decor was darkish, with a lot of hardwoods used as wall coverings. But a very casual and welcoming vibe. Our waitress was very good, patient with us noobs, and receptive to our special requests. I think on a future visit I would prefer trying a large pie, it was only a few$ more than our personal size, and appeared to be much bigger and a little thicker. My only minor complaint was the cost of the meal, I think $13 or so for these tiny pizzas is steep, another place I can think of has this size with unlimited( though lesser quality) toppings for less than $10. There seems to be a few other good shops nearby, so we will most likely try them before returning here. Rounding up to 4 thanks to killer meatball Yelps",

  "text": "On my recent trip to Philly, I loved Frieda so much I came here three times. That is something I never do ever, as I usually try to experience as many spots in a city as humanly possible while traveling. But I was so smitten with Frieda that I genuinely looked forward to returning.\n\nMISSION: Frieda is an intergenerational restaurant, community center, art gallery, bakery, and coffee shop. Its primary identity may be a restaurant, but they often flip the space for workshops, readings, and other cool classes. They sell amazing local goods by local makers, and I love their statement about their artists, bakers and employees: \"And while you're here, know that any money you spend at FRIEDA helps us create fair-wage jobs for people of all generations - many of them retired, but still needing to work to make ends meet - as well as support our Outreach Community Program.\"\n\nFOOD + DRINK: Reasonably priced and crave-worthy. The salmon avocado toast was beautifully presented, had delicious flavor and was very generous. As for bakery, my Mom and I both agreed their croissant was the best we've ever had. Thick but still flaky and melt-in-your-mouth chocolate. The London Fog and other coffee drinks we had were always well-made and satisfying.\n\nSERVICE + VIBE: Nahir is amazing. I actually hugged him on my final visit! We had so many great chats about Frieda's programs, the menu, and just Philly in general. He went above and beyond. The vibe here is very white and minimal, but open and airy. You get a great feeling just sitting there and existing.\n\nI wish this spot was in Cleveland because I'm obsessed with its multi-faceted approach to community and its inclusiveness. I can't recommend it enough! It is such a pleasant surprise that you can feel good about supporting.",

  "text": "This place has no menu because they serve just one thing: pho ga (chicken). Well, they will also serve you pho bo (beef), but why in the world would you order that if the name of the place is Cafe PHO GA Thanh Thanh?\n\nIn the DMV, there are no places that specialize in pho ga, so there was definitely a novelty factor in my experience. Usually, when you order pho ga, you receive a piping bowl with slices of either white meat or dark meat. Here, you can have that AND a plate of sliced chicken (used to make that broth) on the side. I was advised to order a bowl of plain pho (no meat) and a plate of chicken on the side. For two people, small pho bowls and half a chicken are plenty. Pho was actually developed in Northern Vietnam and this place definitely served their food Hanoi-style. The sauce for the chicken was a mixture of lime juice, lime leaves, salt, pepper, and thinly sliced habanero peppers. In the South (where my family is from), it is dipped into nuoc mam gung (ginger fish sauce). After trying the Hanoi-style dip, I still have a nuoc mam gung bias. I suggest everyone try the Hanoi-style dip and judge for themselves because it might be your cup of tea. The broth of the pho is light and flavorful. The chicken platter includes offal, such as creamy liver and heart. \n\nService was decent. The establishment is on the small side and in a predominantly Vietnamese zone, but not what is considered Little Vietnam (Bella Vista). Cash only.\n\n3.5 stars, but will round up for novelty factor.",

  "text": "This was a five star experience for me all around.\n\nFirst of all, I'm shocked it was so hard to find menu pictures. I tried their website, I tried Yelp, I tried Google and came up with nada. I'm not as persistent as I was before kids when I had all the time in the world, but I would have thought there'd be one Yelper who took a picture. I posted menu pictures, albeit not the best quality because of people's heads blocking some parts, but I tried to get the most I could. Zoom in and most of the menu is legible between all four pictures. You're welcome.\n\nI've been dairy free for four (?) months when my nursing baby was diagnosed with a possible dairy intolerance. All I could think of was I never got the chance to get Shake Shack's cheese fries. (It wasn't open that long before the baby was diagnosed and I'd been waiting for the lines to die down.) Once I got cleared (well I strong armed the doctor into allowing me, but the results are the same) to eat dairy again, I knew I had to come to Shake Shack. \n\nParking: super easy. There are a ton of outdoor lots and indoor garages. It will be interesting to see the parking situation when everything opens since a lot is still under construction, but on a Monday at 11 a.m. there were a bazillion spots open.\n\nOrdering: The iPad system is really efficient. As long as the people in front of you aren't super slow (which luckily the people in front of us were not), it makes ordering a breeze and pretty foolproof that your order will be correct. There isn't that much customization that can be done (for instance if you randomly want a rare burger, which why would you at a fast food chain, but I digress, you can't get that. You can customize it to be well done though. I wanted it without the bun and with a lettuce wrap and that was an option). I won't be able to order extra cheese on my fries, but I'll live. Overall I like this system. You enter your phone number and they text when your order is ready.\n\nSeating: There's outdoor and indoor seating. Since it's pandemic time, I really appreciate the abundance of outdoor seating. We were here at 11 a.m. on a Monday so not exactly prime time, so I was happy that we pretty much got our pick of tables. Some have large umbrellas that is helpful in the sun.\n\nFood: I got the Black Truffle Burger and cheese fries. All I can say is amazing. The crispy shallots really made the burger. Also, I chose lettuce instead of a bun and the lettuce was massive. It made holding the burger a breeze. The fries didn't let me down either. More places need to embrace cheese sauce. \n\nI'm lucky this place is 25 minutes from me or else I'd gain 20 pounds. I prefer this place to a lot of restaurants in Tampa. Quick, delicious and (relatively) cheap. I'll definitely be back.",

It was as if none of the employees had been trained in how to make orders.

Oh and make sure to get ranch and bleu cheese dipping sauce!\n\nI imagine this would be perfect party or game day food as well. I'd totally throw a party just to cater fries and wings from Ale Emporium. And to have beer with them. Sounds like a plan!",

  "text": "What better way to end an eventful day that led into the evening, but with an amazing meal at Del Frisco's. As we walk in (Jason K. and I) it might have been a little past 10 pm the first thing you take notice is the decor.  Del Frisco's has 3 floors from the basement to the main floor, leading to the second floor with every floor having a tranquil state. This by far is telling you to just come in ,relax and enjoy .  \n \nA former bank converted into a steak house with still a few items left behind to remind you of its past. If you should go to the basement you'll see the vault, this GIANT vault door leading you into another room. This  is where they would host private parties, with  the cases and cases of wine to be admired as you enjoy the atmosphere.  \n \nThe bar is another great view, with flat screens along with ample seating lining around this place of homage to the libation gods. Then you take notice to the tower of wine bottles leading up to the ceiling . There is more, Del Frisco's also has a fantastic assortment of liquors and drafts to follow. Del Frisco's basically covered the aficionado in you. I feel the libation gods would highly approve of this marvel.   \n \n                                   *The feast that was had* \n \nAppetizers- \n \nSteak Tartar~ This came with toasted bread so we could spread the Tartar over it. A nice subtle taste to it, somewhat pasty. Now would I go with again? I would try something else in my opinion. \n \nFried Oysters~ (2x) This is something we had to order again being it stole the show in the appetizer realm. This came with 2 dipping sauces, I believe one was their homemade tarter and a mild cocktail sauce. Nice sized pieces of oysters that covered the plate.      \n \nMain Course with sides- \n \nDel Frisco's Double Eagle Steak ~   A carnivores paradise down to the bone. This was 22 ounces of deliciousness with a peppered crust rubbed into it. Cooked to a medium rare with every cut that just melted in your mouth with every bite. Made me say \"Oh my Lord, I'm in heaven\"  chew some more and then unleash a moan of satisfaction. I could not finish this masterpiece, this work of art, Michelangelo himself would have been jealous.  This was my lunch for the following day , still held that amazing taste.   \n \nKing Crab Gnocchi along with the Lobster Mac and Cheese was shared for our sides. Yelpers .. my fellow carnivores,  these heavenly side dishes were the perfect compliment to our steaks.  It was doing a double hit, entering a state of bliss, a euphoria one might say , making your taste buds go into a frenzy. This tag team duo of cheesy goodness that had chunks of crab and lobster mixed in there. This was like I've died and gone to food heaven, a food induced coma.  A MUST order , do it you'll thank me.  \n \nDessert- (shared) \n6 Layer Lemon Cake ~ Like we needed more food , but this was something I have heard about , we just had to do it. Picture 6 layers of heaven with a lemon filling separating each layer. A soft sponge type of  cake, covered in a lemon icing that would make anyone sing with a choir.  Simply put , this was Orgasmic !  \n \nThe service was on point, our waitress Sasha was with us for every step of the way , making sure everything was to our standards. The general manager was there, a great guy by the name of Carmen that I met, which Jason already knew talked with us. Joking around making sure we were as comfortable as could be. A friendly staff I feel makes your meal even more enjoyable. Even with my \"eh\" on the Steak Tartar , this is simply a 5 star rating across the board, even if it is a chain establishment.",

  "text": "This is a review of the walking path that spans the entire bridge.\n\nTo be honest, reviewing the actual drive across the bridge never crossed my mind. I primarily use this bridge as a running/biking trail. You may find it weird that a path next to traffic is one of my favorite exercise destinations in Tampa Bay, but I challenge you to try it and not feel transported away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nA few facts that put into perspective the beauty of this walkway. It is 3,500 feet and cost more than $27 million. Let that sink in for a second - that's a lot of doughnuts. Heck, that's a lot of Bern's dinners! Do I look at the walkway and think, yes that was the best use of $27 million? Well no, because of, you know, poverty, homelessness, etc., but you can't turn back the clock, so you might as well soak in the extravagance of this bridge now that it exists.\n\nYou are able to run the entire bridge from Clearwater to Tampa. I believe it is about 11 miles total, but don't quote me on that. I do know that if you start from the middle of the bridge, right where there's a huge...bridge (seriously, there is a part of the path where the walkway separates from the driving lanes to create a bridge. It's a bridge within a bridge.), it is three miles to run to the Tampa side. Therefore, you get a nice six mile run if you run to Tampa and back (I always have to return to where I started so I can get my car) including the excruciating incline that is the bridge within a bridge. Other than that bridge within a bridge, the pathway is flat.\n\nThe palm trees that line this walk really contributes to the beauty of it. With the foliage, the beautiful water, and Tampa in the background, you can get some pretty Instagram worthy shots. It also breaks up your run if you stop every so often to take a picture to make non Floridians jealous. #yesitswinter #runninginshorts.\n\nParking along the walkway is super easy. There are tons of parking spots and I've never had a problem finding one. It's very clearly marked where you can pull off the main highway to park. I'm always coming from the Clearwater side so I park right before the bridge within the bridge. I'm a masochist and enjoy beginning and ending my run with a steep incline (although at my speed I guess you can call it \"running\").\n\nThe beauty of this walkway is not lost on the residents of Tampa Bay. There are always people out walking, running, fishing, generally enjoying nature. If you judge Tampa solely on this path, we would seem like a very fit city. \n\nI've actually forced someone from out of town to run with me on this bridge so they could experience the allure of Tampa Bay. Yes, I had to loan her workout clothes and shoes, but it had to be done. That's how much I love this trail.\n\nIf you're looking for a great new walking trail, forgo the parks and normal sidewalks and come to the Courtney Campbell Bridge.",

  "text": "A song that I love so dearly begins: \"Things we lost to the flames...\" \n\nRincon Market has shown a notable improvement since the fire of 2013. We thought the market would not rebound. It stayed closed forever and ever and ever. \n\nThe footprint is pretty much the same, though the grocery section appears to take up a bit more real estate. Here, you will find a hot deli (with an amazing asparagus soup, which appears to be on rotation), a delicatessen and an amazing salad bar. \n\nIn fact, my favorite thing to do while vising the market is to hit up the salad bar. Biggest salad bar I have experienced in life -- I am sure. You have the choice of dozens of toppings for your salad. Hard-boiled eggs, chicken, different cheeses, tofu, several different types of olives, onions, corn, dolmas, couscous, peppers, marinaded tomatoes, croutons, and a bunch of different cold salads -- and so much more. All yummy and fresh. \n\nThey also have a wonderful selection of fish and meats, including ribeye, tenderloin, porterhouse, salmon, ahi tuna, sea bass, halibut and salmon roe (ikura). Very good ikura, in fact, imported from Japan. \n\nIf you are looking for lunch on the run -- or if you have time to sit in, or out on the patio -- they do sell (often on rotation) lasagna, chimis, meatloaf, chicken Parmesan, roasted potatoes, sandwiches, mac n' cheese, steamed vegetables and a whole range of other hot dishes. Plus the desserts! People go nuts over the cookies, pies, cakes, pastries and other sweet eats. \n\nThey serve breakfast, and also have a kid's menu -- so family friendly, yes. \n\nThe only ding -- prices can be a bit steep, and no WIFI. \n\nFYI: For those of you looking for catered services, Rincon will cater all kinds of events, including weddings. And they even have a meeting space for groups and organizations.",

They also have an extended happy hour and lunch specials.\n\nThe multiple seating areas at Royal Orchid can accommodate a very large gathering but the setup maintains intimacy and comfort and isn't overwhelming at all. The main space is a large open area with a bar area and dining space with high tables and comfy booths. There is also a patio area, more secluded side dining area and banquet rooms.\n\nRoyal Orchid serves various Asian dishes and offers a lunch buffet. The Tom Yam Goong, Thai shrimp coconut lemongrass soup, was tasty. The lamb korma was excellent with a rich subtle taste. The mango lassi was rich and delicious. The naan was excellent. They will spice to the heat desired and the food tends to have some zip.\n\nDishes are served in hammered silver bowls and rice (white, brown, jasmine) that are conducive yo family style and group dining. Have as much or as little of any one dish as you like! They also split a soup no problem so two of us could share it. Serving various dishes over a rice felt traditional and everything tasted very good. \n\nWe met the chef who has more than two decades of experience internationally. Our server Kristina was super and sweet. It's a classy tasteful feeling space but also relaxed. There are even nooks with pool and Foosball for gamers.\n\nLook forward to returning. Hope people find this great space with some very tasty dishes.",

  "text": "With the Pho 75 in Chinatown closing and the bulk of the Ramen Boy reviews scaring me I found myself in serious need of finding a quick and easy noodle fix when I didn't feel like climbing aboard the Pho Train (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-xe-lua-viet-thai-philadelphia#hrid:TqIDfYjlnBN7MbrDfxqbEA/src:self). Fortunately I remembered Rachel's and Steven's reviews and was able to savor a bowl of the comforting pleasure that hand drawn noodles delivered.\n\nif my pho addiction had taught me anything its that the perfect asian soups have to be filled with a revitalizing broth, a plentiful and oftentimes odd assortment of additional ingredients, and a helping of some of the best noodles that you've ever had; all while coming at a fairly inexpensive pricetag. And for just $6 the seafood soup with shrimp, scallops, clams, and fish balls had Nan Zhou delivering on all cylinders. But the main thing I wasn't expecting was the fact that the tantalizing consistency and interesting back story of the hand drawn noodle recipe may have me giving pho and ramen a stink eyed comparison for the forseeable future.\n\nBe sure to bring cash to get your fill, but not a whole lot unless your table feels the need to split random delicacies like marinated duck, beef tendons, and spicy pig ears. And be sure to keep your vegetarian friends at a distance.",

We were on our way to the Franklin Institute and decided to grab a quick lunch since we had skipped breakfast.\n\nWhile visually nice inside the music, as mentioned by others reviewing this establishment, did leave a lot to be desired. Especially at lunch time. \n\nI really enjoyed the salsa they provided with the chips while we waited for the entree to arrive. One thing I've noticed about Mexican restaurants up north is they only give you salsa with your chips, no white sauce like they do further down south.\n\nBoth of us had meal that consisted of 3 beef taco's for lunch. It was ok, but I've had better. There was something about the way the way the ground beef was prepared that I didn't like. Maybe it was the spices. However it filled the spot. \n\nAll in all, not a bad experience but it wasn't great either. Next time I'm in town I'll be trying another Mexican restaurant.",

  "text": "My new obsession. The Crêpe Place is a newish brick & mortar for The Crêpe Cart located in the French Market. A simple name, but I'm just going to refer to it henceforth as Vegan Crêpe Paradise.\n\nAlthough crêpes lend themselves well to eating in transit, unless I'm in a rush, I prefer to sit down and eat. This airy cafe with plenty of seating is all kinds of perfection for me. I had a lunch meeting here the other day (though to be fair, I was so into my hummus crêpe, it was hard to concentrate on anything but!) \n\nThe folks behind this operation are so dang nice, too! I believe the owner was training a new crêpe maker, and both were super helpful and enthusiastic about their product. I am not used to having an entire menu of vegan options, so I was pleasantly overwhelmed. I mean... sweet *and* savory crêpes for vegans (and GF, though this is not me)? SWOON. For my first food of the day, I always go with savory and the hummus crêpe was calling my name. \n\nBut first, the perfect latte. Although I'm used to paying more along the lines of .50 for almond milk and here it's a $2 up charge, it's worth it (not sure what brand they use but it's very creamy and steams well). \n\nMy crêpe was lovingly prepared and bursting with goodness: creamy hummus, greens (basil and spinach, I believe), tomatoes. Honestly, I cannot get it out of my head and I need to go back immediately. I was encouraged to try the pesto crêpe next time and I'm counting down the days. \n\nThis is also a great dessert place. Besides the aforementioned sweet crêpes (I've never had a sweet crêpe in my life, but memories of walking past crêperies in Europe are vivid. Especially because I knew them damn crêpes would never be vegan!), there's also vegan donuts.\n\nI adore this place so hard.",

The back bar area is only opened on Wednesday - Sunday.  Our waitress wasn't the friendliest, but she got the job done.  \n\nThe menu is limited, but the offering they have is done well.  I started off with the $5 fried chick peas, but they weren't that good.  They were crunchy and slightly spiced, but I kept waiting for more flavor to kick in.  The $7 KALE SALAD was great!  The soft boiled egg was a fantastic touch.  I went with the $18 special chicken and it was delicious.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  \n\nFor dessert, I got the $5 ICE CREAM SANDWICH and it was magnificent.  It came wrapped like a giant piece of candy.  The cookie was soft and perfectly sweet and went really well with the ice cream.",

They've been on my \"must visit\" list for quite some time, and admittedly, I can be a creature of habit, even in this job. I stick to the same lunch spots when I'm on the go, mostly out of convenience and obviously familiarity. Anyhow, I chose Delectables to pick up a salad as I was on the go as usual. An order of the spinach salad with walnuts, apples, olives, and feta, subbed the chicken for grilled salmon was quite tasty and generous. The salmon was a bit over cooked and tough for my liking, but I at least it's wild salmon. I'll take over fatty farm raised salmon any day. The hostess was a pleasure and pick up was easy peasy. Their new updated bar looks super welcoming and cozy...and I did I mention their check-in offer is 50% off a bottle of wine? Dang! Aside from that, their menu is super vegetarian and health conscious friendly. It has been for many years. It's been a while since I've had the cheese plate, but that's nice too. Looking forward to a cozy happy hour or dinner in the very near future.",

Das Gebäude in der Market Street wirkt von außen wirklich beeindruckend und auch von innen wird man nicht enttäuscht.\n\nIm Eingangsbereich fühlt es sich noch fast wie ein ganz normales Kaufhaus an. Aber auch hier fallen schon die tollen Stuckdecken, die mächtigen Säulen auf und man hat eher das Gefühl in einem Florentiner Palast zu sein. Das Gebäude ist das ehemalige Wanamakers Kaufhaus, das von Macy´s in 1995 übernommen wurde und ist wirklich ein architektonisches Meisterwerk..\n\nWenn man dann weiter in das Innere des Kaufhauses vordringt stößt man auf den Grand Court, der seinen Namen aufgrund der Größe zu Recht trägt. Einfach nur überwältigend und wir haben erstmal die Köpfe nach oben kreisen lassen. Irgendwie eine Mischung aus Opernhaus und Kirche, denn an einer Wand ist die riesige Wanamakers Pfeifenorgel angebracht. \n\nDer Grand Court soll auch über eine einzigartige Akustik verfügen. Jährlich findet hier die Macys Weihnachts Light Show statt, ein einzigartiges Licht- und Tonspektakel. Untermalt wird das ganze mit einer festlichen Beleuchtung des Grand Court und einem festlich geschmückten Weihnachtsbaum.\n\nIn der Mitte des Grand Court befindet sich dann auch noch der riesige Wanamaker Eagle. Die Bronzestatue soll 2.500 Pfund wiegen und wurde wie die Orgel 1904 von der St. Louis Weltausstellung erworben. Der Adler ist natürlich ein sehr begehrtes Fotoobjekt und fast jeder Tourist lässt sich mit ihm ablichten.\n\nEingekauft haben wir nichts, da wir nur Blicke für die einzigartige Architektur hatten. Ein wirklich sehenswertes Gebäude.",

Over the years I've had many different concoctions of this sandwich and Yiro Yiro's version was pretty darn good.\nI DoorDashed them yesterday and delivery was extremely quick and I appreciated the care and the use of quality packaging they use. You would be surprised seeing how some spot use cheap containers for their food.\nI ordered the beef/lamb combo with a rice pilaf, fresh salad of diced tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant and spices, and a wonderful spicy feta dip. I finished the meal with a scrumptious baklava.\nThe meal came with triangular shaped grilled pita bread. The portions were abundant.  I grabbed a slice of the pita bread and crammed as much of the meat the bread could handle and smeared the spicy feta cheese dip over it. What a heavenly bite! The beef and lamb was tender and that spicy feta was the truth. The rice pilaf was fluffy and not dried out and I didn't know the name of the salad, but it was so fresh and crisp, a perfect accompanying item for the meal.\nThe baklava was magnificent, two large pieces encrusted with honey and pistachios with a thin layer of vanilla icing across the top of the philo dough. It was a sweet ending to a good meal. \nI would have awarded Yiro Yiro 5 stars if I would have received whole pieces of the grilled pita bread so I could make a whole gyro, the small pieces of pita ran out quickly. Next time I will ask for that in advance.",

We had two servers taking care of us -- both of whom were exceptionally (I thought) attentive to the needs of two vegetarians in our party... taking care to make recommendations, bring substitute dipping sauces and make sure no fish sauce was included in anything they ordered. \n\nI opted for a bun dish, vermicelli with pork egg roll. The helping was not as large as I'm accustomed to back home, but it was plenty for one for lunch. The nuoc cham was nothing short of magic; what do they do to make there's such a perfect balance of flavor? I doused it over my dish and added plenty of hot sauce, dipped my chopsticks through the crisp cucumber, carrot shavings down into the warm noodles. Oh yeah. \n\nDecor is more dressed up then your typical family-owned Asian restaurant. Even the bathrooms were nice! Great food and great service. Pretty large amount of menu options, but would have appreciated more lemongrass items and chicken options. Would have loved to try some pho, but it was prohibitively hot outside to tackle that!",

  "text": "*******Restaurant week Review***** I was surprised to find out that I could indulge in restaurant week in my old home town of Cherry Hill! I love this town, it's people, and especially the restaurants. \nI've been to the capital grille in Philadelphia, but never the one in CH! They opened it shortly before I moved from this area. \nEsthetically everything was perfect and very comfortable. I didn't like being sat in the bar area once we said we were there for restaurant week, but I had a meeting soon after my lunch so I didn't want to make waves. My lunch date didn't seem to mind. The bartender who was serving everyone in the area did an exceptional job and she should be commended. \nWe both ordered the salmon for an entree an appetizer and desert. I loved the flourless chocolate cake and I enjoyed my meal overall.",

  "text": "My friends really, really wanted to do this tour on our last trip to New Orleans, so as the accommodating host I am, I signed us up. Now, little bit of a disclaimer... some of my girlfriends are really into the whole Twilight/Vampire Diaries thing. I am not. But I'm not opposed to vampire lore. I've read my fair share of Ann Rice books and seen plenty of old vamp horror flicks.\n\nThe tour I pictured was something completely different. Intimate and entertaining with just a little bit of kitsch. It was none of this. First of all, at the meeting place I was expected there to be maybe 10-15 people waiting. There were so many people (75-100?) that I was confused. Who were all these people? Were we all going on the same tour? They broke us into \"smaller\" groups and away we went. Our \"small\" group had maybe 20-25 people and seemed to keep picking up more as the tour went on. You couldn't hear anything the \"host\" was saying unless you were on his heels constantly. The stories were kind of boring and dragged on. \n\nMost of us ended up bailing half way through. I hate to say it but this was kind of a waste of money.",

  "text": "Was visiting with my boyfriend for the weekend like I always do and decided to get some delivery since we can no longer go out to eat anywhere. We ended up choosing this spot because it had pretty decent reviews on Yelp and we never tried it before, so we were trying some place different. \n\nWe ended up ordering a bun, cheese wonton, crab dumplings, to share and he got the beef stick with shrimp fried rice, and I ordered the sesame chicken which came with white rice. \n\nAs far as the apps, the beef stick were the highlight of them, the flavors that the beef was seasoned with was so tasty. The bun, cheese wonton and crab dumplings werent anything spectacular and I wouldnt order those again. \n\nAs for the sesame chicken with white rice, it was so good too. The chicken pieces were huge and the glaze on top was very flavorful. \n\nI would eat here again and try some other things but maybe eat in once the virus is over with. Maybe it would taste different.",

  "text": "I was anxious about air travel with my family - that included two children under the age of three. Faced with the reality of bags, baby carriers, car seats, strollers, and the 17,000 lbs of other \"stuff\" you need while traveling with children, I really had no idea how the hell we were going to get to Florida without strapping our luggage to our backs like a bunch of pack mules. While we still (likely) looked like a rag tag bunch, Visiting Baby was absolutely clutch to deliver many of our baby and young child necessities to our week-long beach rental so we didn't have to cart them along! \n\nI'll just come out and say it - the website is dated. The ordering process was clunky and it was hard to figure out what we ordered for the week while reading through a very long confirmation email that was all in paragraph form. That being said, they totally came through with an on-time order delivery and pickup and provided great items for our week. We rented the following:\n\n-Double stroller: Baby trend side by side double stroller that definitely had some wear, but it worked very well for us. \n-High chair: Very clean and a necessity for our one year old.\n-Toy box: This was the shining star of our order. Allison (Visiting Baby owner) requested info about what our two girls like, their ages and whatnot. Our toy box was custom \"curated\" and chock full of books, toys and even dress up items that kept our girls highly entertained. \n-Music table: Again, very clean, and a hit for our little one. \n-Play mat: 25 foam squares for a more comfortable play space on top of the tile floor. \n-Pack n play: In great shape and provided a comfy mattress and fitted sheets. \n-Bed rails: Self-explanatory, clean and functional.\n\nOverall, this service is a godsend for families traveling with young kiddos, and with a handful of technological improvements like an updated ordering system, text options for delivery/time frame, Visiting Baby would be 5 stars in no time.",

  "text": "French Quarter Haunted Ghost Tour\n\nGreat tour with Clint! We had a better \"haunted\" experience this time with our tour guide, Clint (in reference to our first experience last year). We used our City Pass and booked an evening of the French Quarter Haunted Ghost Tour. We stopped by famous places like Lalaurie Mansion, Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop and the Omni Royal as Clint proceeded to tell us stories behind each landmark and, you know, ghostly sites and stuff where ghastly spirits have been documented. I found the stories fascinating.\n\nLafitte's Blacksmith Shop is actually a bar and it has a long haunted history. We were given a chance to go inside and check it out for a chance encounter with Jean Lafitte. Legend has it that he simply stands in the dark corners, staring at people until he is noticed, at which time his ghost disappears into the shadows. Not sure if his ghost would show up with all that people inside but supposedly he is always seen on the first floor, most of the time near the fireplace that's inside. Well, that was just one of his stories... there's many more where it came from. \n\nThis non-theatrical, non-costumed tour guide shared events rooted in NOLA history and feature historically accurate storytelling. Clint was a great storyteller, no sugar coating anything. The tour was about two hours long. It is a walking tour so wear comfy shoes and probably bring a bottle of water to hydrate yourself. Normal Entry Price - Adult: $25.00  \n\nReview #1500 updated",

  "text": "The last time I ate at the old Farmer Boy predates my existence on Yelp, and it looks like I've been on here since 2007. You can infer my opinion of the diner from that. But just in case: I distinctly remember my dining companion having a large hair in his butter, which he pointed out, and the returning dish simply had the hair picked out and the pat of butter flipped upside down. So...if that's what was needed to keep menu costs cheap, I don't mind paying a couple dollars more. But that's the old Farmer Boy.\n\nThe new Farmer Boy is all cleaned up, and bright and tidy! It was a Monday lunchtime and all tables were filled, with a few seats open at the counter. We had a meatloaf sandwich and the chicken and waffles, and were very pleased with both.\n\nThe chicken is fried to order, it'll take 12-15 minutes. Its coating is zippy, as is the chile-spiked syrup. It's $11 for a Brussels style Belgian waffle and two large fried wings. An additional order of the chicken is $4. \n\nThe other lunch fare is in the $10-12 range, on par with most restaurants. On my visit, the other patrons had the full range of young and older people, and I ran into family friends from the San Roque area. Everyone was friendly, the food was hot and good. I'm a fan. \n\nThe old Farmer Boy will forever be associated with Mary Birdie, and that woman really scared me. May she rest in peace, along with the old restaurant.",

  "text": "I've hit up Village Whiskey twice in the past couple of months and it's still a great spot for a bite. Both visits were on Sundays, and we've been lucky to get seated right away both times even though the restaurant is small and seating is tight. \n\nOn the first visit, three of us shared a bunch of plates: pickled cherry tomatoes, village burger, bbq pork sammy, and duck fat fries with Sly Fox cheddar sauce. Everything was delicious! I was also happy to see a couple solid non-alcoholic options as well; the lavender fields was a hit! \n\nLast Sunday, I tried the veggie burger and my sister had the bbq pork sammy. Again, we ordered the fries with cheddar sauce. I do think the cheddar sauce could have a bit more flavor, but the fries themselves are really great regardless.  \n\nHonestly, Village Whiskey is a spot I didn't think about much because I always just assumed it would be too crowded. Now that I've found the sweet spot, it's becoming part of my weekend rotation!",

  "text": "When I first started working in the suburbs, I felt fear.  I feared the commute on the fabled I-76.  I feared the loss of my individuality, as plenty of movies/paintings/songs lament over the disintegration of self that results from daily work.  I feared that this was the next step in life, which would bring me one step closer to its bitter, bitter end.\n\nBut most of all, I feared lunch.  I want to look forward to lunch every day by making it really awesome(on days where I don't pack my own food).  My coworkers had enthusiastically recommended a small independent sandwich shop called Wawa where I could get lots of different things for lunch.  Wow!  They have soups AND sandwiches AND cigarettes!(I don't smoke but maybe I will start now).  My prospects looked bleak and, like many in a state of desperation, I turned to Yelp...and Yelp delivered.\n\nI walked into Nadia Thai at lunchtime and the place was impressively packed.  This is a good sign.  I had the lunch special($8.95 for two starters and an entree) - spring roll, coconut soup, and chicken red curry.\n\nThe soup and the curry were freaking delicious(the spring roll was OK).  The service was prompt and friendly.\n\nRemember that fear that I talked about in the opening of this review?  It melted like the faces of those guys in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I had found a solution to my problem, and it came in the form of Thai food in Lansdale.  I will be returning to this establishment frequently.\n\n5 stars for currently being my favorite lunch in Montgomery County.\n\nOn the action-movie-parallel-satisfaction-scale, this place is the final fight at the end of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith BUT all of the terrible plot points and asinine dialogue and hate from everything about all of the prequels has been deleted from my brain, Eternal Sunshine style.",

  "text": "BIBOU (Part 1 of a 2-part review; click link below at bottom to read Part 2):\n\nWhat, PhillyBestBYOB, no reviews of Bibou???  And you call yourself an expert on Philly BYOBs?\n\nAlthough I enjoyed this amazing restaurant a total of 5 times in 2012 and 3 time so far in 2013, I went to the \"Bibou at Blackfish\" dinner last Monday and we are planning a Southern Rhone wine dinner for next week, for some reason I have kept putting this review off.  Perhaps I don't feel that I can really do Bibou the justice it deserves, or maybe I'm having trouble picking the ultimate of ultimate dining experiences, from among so many great meals, about which to write a truly epic ode to French bistros that will finally win me Yelp's ROTD?\n\nOr maybe I'm just procrastinating?\n\nAnyway, I'm going to pick a dinner from last year to write about, since I took photos of all the dishes and have pretty good tasting notes (although appologies to Bibou if I get some of the ingredients wrong...I love Pierre's sexy French accent, but I don't always catch everything).\n\nSince this is an ode, some accompanying music seems appropriate (you know this has to be a great restaurant if someone takes the trouble to write a rap song about it, explicit lyrics and all!):\n\n\"She said she wanted foie gra,\nAnd some escargot.\nI said I didn't care for that,\nWas tired of the snow.\nShe ordered three appetizers,\nAnd wanted one to go.\nI told her she was crazy.\nWhat she doin', I don't know.\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCneE4uC514\n\nSunday, 21 October 2012 (see photos):\n\n10 of us, 9 guys and 1 gal (Ladies, this is why you should go to our wine dinners, the guys usually outnumber the gals, so you will be totally fawned over!) met for a Champagne and Rhone wine dinner at Bibou.  An early seating at 6PM, since these dinners usually last ~4 1/2 hours, and good luck trying to get parking around Bibou at 8:30PM on a Sunday night.\n\nIn tiny Bibou, a 10-top takes up ~1/3 the room, and given how long these diners last, we are obviously being treated very well by owners Chef Pierre and Charlotte Calmels, since they could probably turn the space a couple of time (although we always order a 7-course tasting menu, so hopefully this all works out financially for them).\n\nAs usual, Chef Pierre created a tasting largely composed of dishes that were on the menu that night, but he often throws in a dish or two just for us, or fulfills a special request (like the amazing 3-fish pate from the old days at Le Bec Fin, which would be too much work to serve to everyone).  That night we enjoyed:\n\n1st course: Pheasant consommé, poured over bites of pheasant -- I'm not usually a consommé fan, preferring richer soups, but there is no question that this was an elegant start to the meal.\n\n2nd course: Venison saddle-cherizo-pistashio-foie gras terrine, with date compote, mustard greens -- Always order whatever pate or terrine is on the menu at Bibou and you will not regret it\n\n3rd course: Scallop, butternut squash, pomegrante, milk-lemon-infused verbena, purple potato puree and potato chip -- A visually striking dish (look at the photo!), with a large perfectly seared scallop that was melt in your mouth\n\n4th course: Foie gras ravioli, Pergourdine sauce (usually a veal sauce made with a sweet wine like Monbazzilac), black truffles -- In my mind, one of Pierre's signature dishes, the combination of foie, pasta, truffle is killer\n\n5th course: Beef tripe, baked in a white wine sauce of tomato, onion, garlic, chicken stock, bread crumbs -- I had this amazing dish for the first time a couple of weeks before, so we specifically requested it...it takes 6-7 hours to prepare this...nice with our Rhones, but really dying for an Italian Sangiovese (sorry Charlotte!)\n\n6th course: Venison meat pie, white chanterelles, blood-current-red wine sauce, mustard greens -- A first-time dish for me, Pierre selected this to match our wines (and everyone in the restaurant benefited), this was everyone's DOTN (Dish of the Night)...don't let the blood sauce scare you, a must order dish if you see it on the menu\n\nRegarding the above dish, I overheard the following comment: \"Stupid good!\" (Craig LaBan couldn't describe it better).\n\nClick link below for Part 2 of this review...",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I went to check this club out when we came on a road trip to Reno for my 22nd birthday. We were wanted to go to a club out here but not knowing which club was \"better\" than the rest, we sort of just picked this out of random and based on the reviews. We were staying at The Atlantis hotel so BuBinga wasn't walking distance. We drove there and we parked in the El Dorado parking lot (since this is where the club was located). The parking lot was packed and we didn't find parking until the 5th floor. When we found parking, we walked into El Dorado and tried to find BuBinga Lounge. It was a bit tricky to find but looking around and following the crowd of young college kids, we knew we were going the right way. \n\nThe wasn't much of a line, since we got there after the club open. The cover charge for the both of us was $10 each. So $20 in total. (much better considering most clubs back in CA were $20 each to get in). We got in and it was loud (as any club is) , packed with people (like any club, with drunks and non drunks). The main dance floor was really small and the VIP area was a decent size but not packed at all. The bar area was CRAZY PACKED (like any club) but literally my bf and I stood at the bar for what seemed like forever! All to order only two little tiny drinks, which was a total of $13, once Cosmo and one Rum and Coke, which were both watered down, but eh whatever. \n\nOnce we got our drinks out of the way, we enjoyed some dancing on a really sticky dance floor, which had drinks spilled all over it. People weren't too crazy, mostly young crazy college kids, some older couples and some singles lingering around. The DJ was awesome, played a little bit of everything, which is always a plus. The club was open until 4am and by 2:30am almost 3am it was starting to die down, so that is when my bf and I decided to leave. We arrived there at 11:30pm and didn't leave till 3am. I felt like it was a decent time to spend at a club.\n\nHad a good time and I will definitely be back! :D",

  "text": "Capital Tacos is a popular Tex-Mex taco shop located up in Land O' Lakes on US 41 extended. The restaurant sits in a corner of the Wisteria strip mall alongside the 2-lane road.\n\nThis is one of those spots where you need to get there well before 12 Noon, else you'll be standing in a long line and waiting for a table. There are a few booths inside the restaurant, and a couple of tables out on the covered patio. Otherwise you stand and wait; or you can phone your order in ahead of time and pick it up to go.\n\nThe place is very popular with locals, and also people willing to drive from all over the Tampa Bay area to try their Tex-Mex food. Lunch is about 20 different menu combos that can be served as tacos, burritos, salads, or bowls. You pick your ingredients from the menu, and then tell them how you'd like it prepared.\n\nFor my lunch I wanted a burrito, and I selected the 'Texas Flood' which was beef brisket, Monterey Jack & cheddar cheeses, caramelized onions, avocado, pickled jalapenos, cilantro, and chipotle BBQ sauce. This \"poodle-sized\" burrito was smothered with salsa and more cheese, and then baked in the oven till ready. My Yelp check-in earned me a free bucket of homemade chips with their salsa.\n\nI thought that the food was very good, but unfortunately with the limited seating options there were folks hanging over my table and willing me to eat faster. The next time that I'm there I'll go in the mid-afternoon or else pick it up as a carryout order.\n\nCapital Tacos is one of many locally-owned and homemade Mexican / Tex-Mex restaurants in our area, and a very solid choice if you find yourself up in Pasco County. They've just opened a second location in the Wesley Chapel area on SR 56, just east of I-75.",

  "text": "Flannel was everything I needed and more during my recent trip to Philadelphia; furthermore, they were so good that I ended up going thrre times during my week-long stay. I very rarely eat at the same restaurant more than once while on vacation so this should attest to how good the food was for me to have gone back two more times after my initial visit. \n\nBaby let's get into it about their baked mac & cheese! I ordered it thinking it was going to taste cute or whatever (like most mac & cheese at sit-down restaurants), but BABY, the chef was not playing around. He stuck his whole foot up in that macaroni because it was seriously the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had at a sit-down restaurant. I ordered it to split with my friend but told him he couldn't have any more after my first bite. It literally tasted like it came out of my grandma's kitchen, and I can't stop thinking about it as I'm typing this review. \n\nNow, Flannel deserves 5 stars from their baked macaroni & cheese alone, but I can also attest that everything else they make here is phenomenal as well.  The Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, the Chicken and Waffles, the ribs, the pancakes, and the \"Flannel Benny\" were all amazing as well, and my friends and I left here full and happy on each visit.\n\nAll in all, Flannel is South Philly's best-kept secret, and probably my favorite restaurant I've been to on Passyunk. More people need to know about this place, and I will be returning on my next visit to Philly.",

I came for a friends birthday dinner and they made us feel very welcome and were attentive to our large party. Seems like a popular date spot as many tables were filled with 2 people dressed up (and they have dim lighting in the restaurant as well...romantic atmosphere for sure). The prices were a little high, but they had a variety of creative rolls that really caught my eye. They also had several Japanese dishes as well. All the food we had was great and came out in a timely manner. Go during lunch because I have heard Origami has excellent lunch specials and try some of their sushi!",

I came here with a big group of friends for our fancy dinner of the trip and for a group of 8, we got seated in a private room which was great! The service was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant was nice and clean.\n\nMy friends and I started off with bread with duo butter tasting. It didn't come free which was unfortunate but we were desperate for carbs after a day of drinking. It came with 4 rolls and a strawberry butter and truffle butter, special for that day. Good and fresh tasting. \n\nAs for the main entrée, I got the seared duck breast which was filling. The duck was cooked very nicely. Okra was tasty. I liked the feta filo clutch because it was a good balance against the sweet pomegranate walnut sauce. We also shared a side of cauliflower which was very delicious. The truffle in the pea pesto was very truffly. The salted almonds were a nice addition, adding a good crunch to the dish.\n\nOverall, a great group dinner!",

  "text": "Acme was recommended by so many friends for my New Orleans trip, so I made it a must-try. \n\nWe came on my birthday (Friday night) in December and the wait actually wasn't too bad at 7PM. We waited maybe 20 minutes and got seated promptly. The inside is casual (no fancy) but I have no cares for ambiance if the food is on point. \n\nWe ordered (from favorite to least favorite):\n\n1. Raw oysters (5/5 stars): WOW. Have I ever tasted such plump, fresh, delicious oysters in my life? I think not. This was most definitely the best fresh tasting oysters I've had the luxury of trying. Amazing. (Raw here is better than Felix's)\n\n2. Softshell crab (5/5 stars): !!! Holy crap. First time eating crab this way - fried but the meat is so soft, so good. The outer layer of fried crust is just perfect - flavorful but not too thick.\n\n3. Chargrilled oysters (4/5 stars): Yum! The chargrilled oysters were flavored with butter, sea salt, cheese, lemon and who knows what else. I really enjoyed dipping the French bread in the sauce - perfect pairing. Still, I always prefer raw oysters to chargrilled because I like the original taste without being masked by so many other condiments. \n\n4. Boo fries (3/5 stars): Fries with roast beef gravy and cheese. Good side to have, but not the best fries in the world. I guess Acme can't be the best at everything haha.\n\n5. Jambalaya (2/5 stars): Nooooo. The rice was rather bland and dry. Not much going on here. Jambalaya is MUCH better at Felix's. \n\nOVERALL\nLOVED IT. For the price it's totally worth coming here, everyone ate to their heart's content and each person only came out to about $25 including tip. If I ever make another NOLA trip this is a must go-back-to :)",

  "text": "Redheaded Stranger is no longer a stranger to me and I am glad about that. The staff, the food, the ambiance and the concept are all great. I think over time it has the potential to be 5 stars but there are a couple of things I think could get it there.\n\nMy friend and I came for a late lunch but there was a line out the door. This is quickly becoming a popular spot! We waited in line for about 30 minutes before we were able to order at the front. The restaurant has a retro/Southwest kind of feel with cactus plants lined up along the window and the mod tables and chairs. They have an outdoor spacious patio that they had decked out with misters which in this August heat was a great idea (although umbrellas would be an even better one). They have a long bar area with seating and then an open kitchen and a place where you can see them making the flour tortillas, fresh. When we got up to order we were informed it would be a 40 minute wait for our food. Since we had already spent 30 minutes in line we were already invested so we stuck it out and waited although we were super hangry by the time the food actually came. Just a note that you will need to patient about the wait if you come here! \n\nMy friend and I both got 2 tacos each since the size looked pretty substantial. The barbacoa taco had a lot of meat in it (yay) as well as black beans, red peppers and a hot sauce. This was super tasty. I also got a vegetarian taco which had poblano peppers, hot sauce and whipped feta. This was also really good so I was happy with these. My friend had ordered queso which was advertised as coming with tortillas. I had made a comment that this was interesting that it didn't say tortilla chips and she had responded that she was sure it was a fried tortilla like a tostada. It was not. The queso came with 2 flour tortillas. Although the queso is a smaller portion, 2 tortillas is not enough to eat with the queso. Conceptually I get it that maybe they want to show off their fresh, housemade tortillas but the practicality factor is just not there. They should reconsider this and serve with housemade tortilla chips!  \n\nPersonally I am a fan but for a pretty small menu it seemed like a really long wait. I understand that this is not a fast food joint but the things we ordered should have already pretty much been prepped and ready to go so I think they could be a bit more efficient there. Otherwise, all great!",

  "text": "Our reason for being at Jub Jub's was simple.  My wife wanted to go to a performance here so we went.  One of her friends was a performer in a \"rock opera\" type of performance.  So most of our experience is with the performance space.  This show was set up in an non-traditional way so I can't put a lot of effort into reviewing the space for performance.  I can only say that it seems like it would be a killer space for a band to play at.\n\nThe bar was a bit cluttered but things moved quickly and the prices seemed to be from affordable to normal Reno prices.  I think they had some basic drinks available at the bar in the performance space and then a more extensive bar in the regular area across the hall.\n\nWe only had waters so can't really say much about the drinks other than they looked really good.  Not just a bunch of ice and a splash of alcohol.\n\nThe sound in the place was great!  The only issues I heard were more from the sound guy than from the actual space itself.\n\nParking sucks.   It's just a small amount then you have to find something on the surrounding streets.  Which is no biggie but can complicate things a bit if you are coming on a rainy or wet night.\n\nGood sized Men's bathroom.  Many bars have gross tiny restrooms this one was just basic and fine.\n\nThe worst part of the evening was the smoke.  As far as I can tell no food is served, so smoking is pretty much freely done in the bar and about the building.  The performance space didn't seem to have any smokers though.  Not sure if this was an edict from the performers or if this is normal for all performance spaces.  Either way, I will probably not go back to Jub Jub's because of the smoking issue.   Even though the smokers stayed quarantined, their  smoke still permeated the whole space.\n\nI know it's not a popular view to take, but I just don't get smokers in general.  When person \"A\" smokes every person (B-Z) around person \"A\" experiences their activity as a participant.  It's like if I went into a restaurant with a bad case of loud stinky farts.  Blammo every few seconds.  Oh I need to fart outside?  Ok I'll do that....mind if I stand RIGHT AT THE DOOR take a break and blast a few juicy ones right where everyone is coming in?  You have a problem with that?\n\nAnyway I digress and apologize to all my smoking friends.  Just frustrates me when I have to go home smelling like smoke and with a headache just because I want to see a cool show.",

  "text": "If you are going for the quintessential Santa Barbara seafood experience, you should check this place out. It is located right at the very end of the Santa Barbara pier. There are maybe, four?, small tables on the outside deck which face the ocean. Super cute and quaint. With that said, prepare for a long wait if you are coming during peak hours.\n\nI shared the following items:\n\n-Santa Barbara shrimp cocktail: seven jumbo, chilled shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemons for drizzling. They were pretty substantial in size and the shrimp themselves had a slight hint of sweetness. $12.95 for the seven shrimp.\n\n-a half dozen oysters on the half shell: they go for market price (in my case, $18 for 6) and we weren't offered a variety of oysters. I think they serve whatever is available for the day.\n\nOkay, and against my better judgement, I opted to try their popular Rock Crab special which I believe, comes with a side of soup (good, creamy clam chowder in my case) and a small salad for a reasonable price tag of $21(ish) dollars. Oh, the crab is also topped with onion rings. Mind you, my experience with eating crab doesn't go beyond dungeness crab which usually breaks into lumps of sweet, crab meat. The texture of the rock crab is nothing like that. The meat is slightly grainy and doesn't easily form into lumps, so I found myself with little strips/pieces of crab meat. The exoskeleton of the rock crab is also incredibly hard, so I really had to work for that crab meat. This was a less than desirable crab eating experience. \n\nIt is what it is. I am usually not a fan of American seafood fare, so I thought for what it was, it was good.",

  "text": "Don Day is easily one of my favourite Korean places in the city. I've been here a handful of times now since my original post (see here) and have yet to experience a bad meal. This is a quintessential hole in the wall, industrial restaurant that seems to be scattered all over Edmonton.\n\nThe moment you step through DD's doors, you're greeted with a heavenly aroma. K-pop videos play non-stop on the TV's and Korean posters plaster the wall as decor. The server/owner is super friendly and genuine. It's like your eating at your Korean friend's parents place. Wish I knew some Koreans here...:(\n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward but the dishes are categorized somewhat randomly. First page has appetizers, meats and their specialty hot pots. Flip the menu over and you're left with bi bim bap, meat and a couple other dishes. I have no idea why their jap chae is so expensive ($19.99)! Ridiculous.\n\nAt least they have some pictures of their popular dishes if you need a bit of guidance. Get a hot pot for sure - a small you can easily share between two to four people.\n\nTrip #1\n- Banchan - there's only two side dishes that you get - kim chee and a rotating dish. This one here is miyeok, a seaplant salad. Any seaweed/seaplant is good in my books. Texturally pleasant.\n- Pork bone soup (#18) ($32.99 medium) - you can't really go wrong with the pork bone soup. Hearty, tender meat, flavourful and spicy. There's chunks of potato and think you also get a side or two of rice to go with this. The meat seemed endless. I wasn't kidding when I said a small would be good enough! The medium was hugeeeee.\n- Bulgogi (#43) ($13.50) - marinated beef stew with vegetables and clear noodles. I like how they throw in noodles so it's not just bulgogi. For good measure, there's even a variety of vegetables like mushrooms, onion, carrot, green onion and cabbage.\n- Beef teriyaki noodle (#10) ($11.50) - only available during lunch. These noodles were thicker, similar to udon or Shanghai style noodles. They came out sizzling hot on a black skillet. If you want something less Koreanish, this is worth a try.\n- Hot stone chicken bi bim bap (#39) ($13.50) - mixed vegetables with rice served in a hot stone pot. Rice had a crunchy bite. I'm not sure why they fry their egg here over the traditional runny yolk. Unsurprisingly, the dolsot bi bim bap was run of the mill. Still on the search to find a solid one in town.\n\nTrip #2\n- Seafood pancake (#7) ($15.99) - for some reason, I've never tried DD's seafood pancake until now. Super crispy but just the right amount of thickness/density. This one is almost on par with Korean Grill's.\n- Spicy seafood soup (#16) ($34.99) - I've had their spicy seafood soup too many times to count now. Spicy, decent variety of seafood, slippery glass noodles, zucchini, arugula and a couple other things thrown into the mix.\n\nThis place is a gem. I'll be here again and again and again.",

It is a tiny shop in an old strip on Jacksonville Road.  Parking is limited and difficult to negotiate.  However, the Dogs are worth the effort.  You can get them as you like them, and fix 'em up with the extra relishes, peppers and table rockets full of mustard and ketchup.  They are all beef, and the rolls have good body and size to fit and hold the extra sauerkraut piled high on top.  When I was finished with my squirts and slices, I could still close the bun and bite into the creation without leakage.  That is a major plus, as there are no tables in the shop now, and I was relegated to eating in my car on this cold Saturday afternoon.  No fuss. No muss. \n\nThe only downsides are the aforementioned parking, lack of seating, and the use of styro packaging.  To save the planet, I would have been happier with a thick paper rollup, and paper towels rather than the thin napkins that require a handful to be effective. \n\nStill, this is a frankfurter lovers' haven.

  "text": "Well, this was quite the experience.\n\nAfter a failed first attempt to even find this place, I made another run at it on a Tuesday at 2:30pm.\n\nEven though it was not exactly peak time for breakfast or lunch, this place was more chaotic than that area outside the will call window just before a Lightning game.\n\nAll that tells me is how popular Brocato's really is and I found it somewhat entertaining trying to navigate around all the other customers inside...first to order and then while waiting to pick up my food.\n\nI do feel bad for the people who eat at the tables inside, because they always have random strangers hovering around or over them. If you like a little personal space while enjoying a meal, forget it.\n\nHow about how Brocato's uses the \"Honor System\" in allowing you to simply grab a bag of chips and a drink on your own away from the counter with every sandwich purchase? They clearly trust their customers and it certainly didn't look like anyone was abusing that trust...even though there's absolutely no way any employee could keep track of that with all the bodies running around in there.\n\nAfter bumping into a few random others while waiting for a large Cuban sandwich (I specified mustard only, which is how an authentic Cuban is actually made), my name and number was called and I was on my way home.\n\nHonestly, I only ordered the large because it was just $1 more than the medium and this was the largest Cuban sandwich I have ever had in front of me. Not only was it long, but it was incredibly thick with an immense amount of meat. (Besides, you avoid an additonal 99 cent charge on your order if you pay with cash)\n\nThis sounds dirty, but I cannot remember the last time I actually hurt my mouth by trying to open my jaws wide enough for a first bite of something.\n\nI've now spent the last 24 hours eating about 1/5 of this sandwich at a time and I still will have more than enough for lunch tomorrow...so Brocato's certainly offers more than your money's worth.\n\nJust be prepared for whatever term you would use as a synonym for \"chaos\" when making your visit, especially if your dining in. (The outside patio seemed very calm, but perhaps it is as hectic as the inside at peak times)",

  "text": "Awesome Indonesian food located in a mini Vietnamese square.\nMy Indonesian husband and in-laws attest the food to be authentic. They always leave with take out orders so they can savor the goodness later in the week. It's always the highlight of any trip to Philadelphia. \nThe best thing about this restaurant is the spice level. Man oh man, the spice level here is amazing. None of that babied down BS. Their sambal is legit HOT. \n\nRecs: \n(+++) Soto Betawi: beef, beef tripe, potato and tomato cooked in coconut broth. Tastes similar to laksa. Comes with a plate of rice and a small side of pickles and hot peppers. This is my favorite dish as I am a soupy kind of gal. \n\n(+++) Original nasi padang. This is the quintessential Indo dish known all around. Comes with  curry chicken, beef rendang, potato patties, spicy shrimp, curry collard green, and green chili. This is the optimal entree if you want to try a little bit of everything.  \n\n(+++) Nasi Pecel Lele: fried cat fish with sides of fried tofu, fried tempeh, anchovy, and sambal. Comes with rice. Ideal for fish lovers. The catfish is decently sized. Easily shareable between 2 people.\n\nReasonably priced, homey, authentic food experience!",

  "text": "Found out about this place using Yelp. It's very near where I used to work when I lived here. It is a small restaurant in a run down strip center on Causeway Blvd. I ordered the most expensive item which was the crawfish étouffée with a side of red beans. Out came a large plate of étouffée which was excellent. Red beans were excellent too. I am only giving 4 stars because this was my first time here but this could be a 5 star place. I will try their gumbo next time. Also their fried chicken looked really good too. My prediction is that this restaurant will quickly outgrow this location and move to a larger place. This is an up and coming restaurant. Good things are ahead for it.",

Beautiful diamonds glisten in the lights and you imagine yourself being draped in luxury while attending some fancy event at someplace interesting. They have a good deal of New Orleans themed jewelry- gators and fleur de lis in every fashion, but they also have a nice selection of vintage jewelry and charms. I loved the selection of antique charms for charm bracelets, and they had so many that I'm tempted to start my own charm collection.\n\nThe owner of the shop was very nice and offered to take anything out of a case, so that we might have a closer look. For the average shopper, many of the items here will be out of price range, but they have a few items that you might like for a special occasion.",

Well, it would be if the food was up to par, but sadly, it isn't.  The seafood gumbo lacked flavor and... seafood.  The shrimp creole was bland.

  "text": "In the unexpected location of a strip mall in Boise's north end you will find this gem, a crown jewel really, pastry café.  From sparkling and warm ambiance to the same in welcoming service to the absolutely remarkable pastries, \"c'est magnifique!\"\n\nBaking, they say, is about precision and chemistry.  I say pastries this remarkable also involve artistry, a bit of magic and passion for the process and outcome.  You can feel the love in the surroundings here and taste it in every bite.\n\nWere I a Boise resident I'd manage my calorie and financial budgets to be a frequent customer at Janjou.   As a visitor to Boise, this is on my \"do not miss it\" list.  It recharges body and soul to go to Janjou.  Highly recommended.  We wish this was in our neighborhood. \n\nTHE VIBE:  Urban cool and \"ahhhh...some\" warm all at the same time.  White walls, dark wood floors, chic white tables and chairs with chrome bases and legs, sparkling windows looking to let in lots of light, sparkling pastry cases displaying lots of artisan bakery delights. Gift bags with brown and orange tissue paper peeking out add a punch of color.  Just right café music mix set at the just right level to support conversation.  People coming and going seemed all ages and walks of life; truly a neighborhood \"all people are welcome\" place.\n\nTHE SEATING:  Seats for roughly a dozen people at six two-top tables  and maybe half a dozen more at high counters with stools at the front windows. On nice weather days there is additional seating at café tables and chairs on the front walkway outside. \n\nTHE BACKSTORY:  Patissiere and Janjou owner Moshit Mizrachi-Gabbitas moved to Boise from Israel in 2007.  She graduated from the prestigious baking school Estella kitat Oman in Israel and completed worked at Patisseries there.  In 2008 she open Janjou Pâtisserie which she named after her mother.\n\nTHE DRILL:  Choose some delights, you won't be able to stop at just one, from the case displays of pastries or quiche.  There are also little cylinders filled with cookies or chocolates which make perfect take away for yourself or as gifts.  Espresso beverages are available too.  Order at the counter, they'll deliver to your table, bus your own.\n\nTHE DELIGHTS: I kid you not when I say in learning the Patissiere was introducing the Breton pastry kougin amann to the line up beginning yesterday morning, that my husband and I made it pilgrimage to the bakery (we live in Bend Oregon six hours away) to try some.  These orbs of tender dough folded with butter and sugar are hard to find in American bakeries and these were excellent!  Worth the trip or those alone, but we also enjoyed framboise choux (puff pastry filled with raspberry cream and topped with fresh raspberries) and a bostok (think brioche toast meets frangipane) to take away.\n\nWe thought prices were very fair too.  Is I recall our choices were @$5 - $6 each.  We have our eye on quiche ($6.95) on our next stop in.  Not to mention I have a doctor to whom I owe being well enough to travel to Janjou.  I think a gift bag of cookies from Janjou will be a nice thank you. \n\nThe coffee service was also perfect.  Americanos we ordered (12 oz $3.20) were hot and bold.\n\nTHIS N THAT\n\n1) LOCATION & NEIGHBORS:  Look for the Marketplace strip mall.  Mazzah Mediterranean is a neighbor.  So is Airbrush nail salon. \n\n 2) PARKING:  Ample parking in the mall lot, there's a location advantage!\n\n 3) ACCESSIBILITY:  Accessible parking in the lot and curb ramp onto walkway.  Level in to the patisserie and throughout.  Saw a mom with a stroller inside and that means room for wheelchairs too.  Loo is accessible down a hallway.\n\n4) FUN:  In the hallway at the back of the cafe you'll find a window that looks into the bright kitchen where the pastries are made and you can watch the Patissiere and her team creating the pastries.",

So good.\n- Blueberry pie: Perfect mini size. I admittedly ate this for breakfast the next day. Shhh.\n- Blueberry macaron: Filling tasted like blueberry pie.

I know you get what you pay for, but for the short term everything I've been able to buy at Walmart for an affordable price has been truly helpful. \n\nNot my favorite place to shop for groceries but I also don't think it's the worst option to pick up a few things if you're already there (like I have done a few times). I also gotta say their rotisserie chicken is DELICIOUS!!\n\nNever had any problems with any of the cashiers or other employees that I have worked with. Everyone has been helpful and friendly, and overall I find this location clean and nice. I would recommend and have a feeling I will be back here again before the week is over...",

It's got a unique flavour all it's own, that's lent from Greek roots and a chef with good taste. \n\nToday I visited with my mom, so that we could go spend the Beall's cash I earned during Black Friday.  The service was awesome and quick. The food was delicious. I ordered a western Omelette and mom ordered a strawberry banana crepe. Both came out just as we asked and both were simply decadent. \n\nI'll find time to come back in the near future.",

The roasted potatoes were bland & required heavy black pepper & salt. The french toast was thick and lacked taste. \nThe mimosa did not disappoint, it was the perfect combination of citrus and champagne.\n\nMy first visit was with a large group:\nI was seated on the patio and the service was horrendous. It was a hot Sunday afternoon and the servers were almost non existent. Drinks took 30 minutes per refill and water glasses on the table were constantly empty. \n\nMy second visit was with my partner:\nThe service was better but the food was cold when it arrived at my table.\n\nOverall both experiences weren't positive. Glad I checked out Boca but I won't be returning.",

Mexican food was agreed upon by all of us and w decided to give La Hacienda a try.  It can be a little difficult to find since it stuck in an inner corner of a large building.  We ended up driving all the way around just to find it.  \n\nAlthough the parking lot needed some cleaning and pot holes filled, Once we pulled up to the restaurant, we found the interior to be clean and lively.  we were given our choice of booth or table and we chose a section where the music was not too loud.\n\nAll three of us ordered something from the lunch menu which was fairly large serving for the price.  Our food came with chips and salsa.  The salsa was very thin with just a hint of heat to it.  The chips were light and crisp...good  enough to munch on even without salsa.  Our entrees came with beans and rice as well, so a full meal. Service was pretty good and the wait time on the kitchen was acceptable.  My wife decided to add a frozen strawberry margarita and thought it needed more mix (not enough berry flavor.)  The waiter brought us our bill and I paid at the front counter.  Overall, a pleasant meal and experience.\n\n#Review 3966",

This place stands out as one of the best places in Saint Louis to buy, honestly, just about anything. \n\nIt's a modern general store, it truly has a pretty vast collection of supplies from fresh flowers, home goods, and clothing to camping supplies, and anything you would need for a cocktail party. Not only do they have it, but their products beam with such obvious quality and it sets them apart from just any ole' shop. \n\nThe family that runs this place is committed to display the vibrancy of Saint Louis and all that it has to offer. They are some creative folks. Just look at the store, it's such a beautiful and comfortable space. \n\nIf that weren't enough, they have a flower bar, where you can put together a bouquet of fresh flowers. They make awesome gifts for your person, friend, or hell, even for yourself. They also have cleaning products, many of which are made with natural and safe products. \n\nLastly, they make a gin called Truly Floral Blue. Right now you can buy it here or at the Frisco Barroom down the street, but soon it will be all over Saint Louis. Get your hands on it. It's fantastic. \n\nCheck them out, especially at one of their events. This place is an awesome addition to Saint Louis. It really shines.",

They have all kinds of INCREDIBLE sweets. \nI can't take it. \n\nI am a huge dessert snob and all I have for SUCRE is compliments. \nOK, perhaps I have one complaint: they need additional seating given we had to duke it out for a table. \n\nWe strolled right in and were instantly overwhelmed by the tantalizing choices. \nHow are we to choose when it all looks so great? \n\nChoose we did and we ordered the white chocolate bread pudding, the salted caramel cupcake, petit red velvet  and the turtle. The bread pudding came with a peanut butter crunch gelato. You have your gelato choice. That's all. We did not even get to have their chocolates or macaroons.  Not enough space. We also got cappuccinos because we could and because we are not in France where they will snub you for it. Booyah! \n\nI know I don't need to say it given my 5 star rating but everything was M-A-R-V-E-L-O-U-S!

  "text": "This review is one of the times that I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars. My experience was truly a A-OK+ visit. I'm sure after another visit or two I could easily be a fan. The food we had was great, what held the score back was the service. The service was just a little slow. \n\nHow we ended up at Molly's was a surprise to us both. We were driving around wanting some place new and being in Soulard - there was hardly a place we hadn't tried, so Molly's is where we ended up. \n\nWe ordered multiple appetizers to create a meal for two. As you will see, we went with a seafood theme. We started out with Tuna Summer Roll and Crab Cake. The Tuna Summer Roll was better then some I have experienced at a Sushi bar. The Crab Cake was moist and flavorful, not like one you'd get in Maryland, but good. \n\nWe also tried their BBQ Shrimp & Green Fried Tomatoes, as you can see it doesn't photograph well and the taste was similar. This dish did not impress us, Broadway Oyster Bar does something similar so much better.\n\nThe last two items I'll mention were the best by far. Molly offers, Alligator Rangoon, something I have never heard of before. I have eaten Alligator and love Crab Rangoon - so why not give it a try. It was very unique and I look forward to having it again. We also tried Baked Macaroni & Cheese which was the bomb. This m&c could be a favorite of mine easily. \n\nLook forward to revisiting and see if I can't bump them up to a 4.",

  "text": "Got the oven going up, on a Wednesday - \nGot cookies baking fresh and I'm choosy.\n\nHappy, Happy - Joy, Joy!! I became familiar with Hot Box Cookie while at law school in Columbia, MO and I must say I am thrilled they are now in the area. The Lou has never seen fresh cookie like this.\n\nCookie Types: Oatmeal and Raisin, Chocolate Chip, Chocolate Chip & Oatmeal combo, Peanut Butter, Monster, M&M's, Red Velvet and many more.  \n\nPeep the scenario: \n\nAll of the above noted cookie dough's are available to you.  You get to choose one, two, hell pick oodles of them. Then your cookies are baked fresh!!! Not made fresh that day but in your face! Nothing says lovin like a warm fresh cookie.  Then, if you thought it couldn't get better, wait, wait, wait, hold - IT ... it does!!! They deliver (but this review doesn't speak to that), have icing sandwiches (2 cookie w/ icing in the middle), ice cream sandwiches and huge cookie cakes.  They also have cookies on display that are made fresh daily for fast service.  Are you in a sugar coma yet?? For milk options they have skim, 2 percent and chocolate (no soy, almond or rice milk yet) and I think Pepsi products are coming. \n\nWhen I went, my wait was only five minutes for fresh cookies so it wasn't bad at all.  The cookies aren't huge but are a very generous size.  I went with: 2 snicker doodle cookies, 2 classic chocolate chip, 2 peanut butter chocolate chip and 2 oatmeal chocolate.  So fresh and so good.  The box was actually hot and the cookies were packaged with care and foil inside to retain the heat.\n\nAnother standout for this business is that they are open late - waaaay late (most evenings until midnight and on the weekend until 2am).  So on those nights when you're out kicking it late and your sweet tooth is on ten (that means on high) this place is ready.  That will really work in this area being so urban (in midtown), close to University, medical centers and the Cortex Innovation Community (a.k.a The District - techies like sweets too). \n\nIf you live in the area (or have lived in any trendy metro area) - you know how cool it is to walk to a bar after dinning at a cool place; you've just had good eats and a nice buzz from whatever you just drank then add in a cool breeze and cookies.  It's those nights you don't forget - those nights that feel like you're in a cool music video or a sassy Sex N the City episode (for guys, let's say How to Make it in America or Entourage).  Have one of those nights or just an awesome day/afternoon and stop by Hot Box Cookies - you'll leave with a big ole smile - I did.",

  "text": "Thanks to the incredible UYE that happened here I just had to book Avero for a good occasion in the future. And that finally came when I took my dad out to an early Father's Day dinner since we were in for an awesome wedding weekend. And overall Avero managed to deliver a lot of solid positives.\n\nSince last visit Avero added a lot of new booths, drapes, and dividers that succeeded in providing a few more intimate sitting areas to the expansive main dining hall. Add in a solid happy hour, a few chef tasting menu options, a well rounded beer and cocktail menu, and accommodating service; and they definitely have a few extra bonuses to make the visit worthwhile.\n\nThe big emphasis on Avero's menu is wood fired pizzas, handmade pasta, and locally sourced ingredients; and the trifecta definitely managed to shine throughout. While I was disappointed to see the foie gras and proscuitto wrapped asparagus that the elite event crew feasted upon off the menu, I did enjoy savoring their delicious calamari again, even if the sauce was a touch more spicier than I remembered. Since I missed out on trying the bulk of their pizzas last time a pie was in order. And the special Spring Pizza that was topped with proscuitto, asparagus, smoked mozzarella, and farmers egg delivered big time. Since I also had to sample their pasta offerings and was craving seafood I decided to go with the fettuccine frutti di mare which delivered the best of both worlds. With gulf shrimp, pei mussels, buttery scallops, and fettuccine that was hand crafted to perfection swimming in marinara sauce, it managed to deliver a perfect bite after bite by the fork full.\n\nWith offerings like that and a menu that features all kind of impressive appetizers, bistro inspired Italian fare, pizzas, and pasta, Avero has plenty of things to make it worth the visit.",

  "text": "Baology first had me at bao! But when it added in tantalizing subject matter like Taiwanese fried chicken and all those dumplings it quickly became my kind of science!\n\nAt its core Baology is modern Taiwanese food with a splash of other Asian influences served simple. Depending on what time you come, the tablet POS system up front will showcase a menu for breakfast, lunch or dinner, And depending on when you come in you might find noodle dishes, bento box style bian dangs, incredible ruen bing wraps, or a good sized helping of 3 cup chicken. But for whatever occasion you come in, you might want to wash your food down with their cold brewed hibiscus and ginger tea.\n\nFor my first visit I was craving those baos, and ordered in a trio. Making the mistake of thinking it wasn't enough food I also ordered some shrimp & pork dumplings which were a sweet and savory explosion! With 5 baos on the menu it was tricky to choose at first, but I enjoyed the following:\n\nKing oyster mushroom bao - the vegetarian bao on the menu and its incredible with its pickled mustard greens, crispy garlic, and hoisin sauce that blends impressively with the mushroom king.\n\nRoasted Berkshire pork belly bao - the fatty and tender pork belly gets accentuated by togarashi aioli, pickled daikon radish, cilantro, and crushed peanut powder!\n\nTaiwanese fried chicken bao - the perfect preview to their fried chicken reigns supreme with lemon aioli and Thai basil!\n\nAfter enjoying the bao I had to try more of that fried chicken, and it proved to be crispy saucy perfection with just a bit of spice. With two good visits under my belt its enough to have me craving more!",

  "text": "This darling, charming restaurant looks like someone's extended dining room. It's cozy, comfortable and inviting with attentive and helpful service. But it is not sizable -- seems like it could only comfortable seat about 30 or so people. \n\nInteresting: The hostess/server will reserve tables in advance and without request for the anticipated larger groups.\n\nOn the menu are items the restaurant boasts are made in house and from scratch. \n\nAmong other options, you have the choice of sour rye soup, beet soup, chicken and pork cutlets, veal schnitzel, potato pancakes, kielbasa and Reuben sandwiches, vegetable salads (with apples, carrots, eggs and potatoes), broiled salmon and desserts like cheesecake, kolaczki and crepes. Polish Cottage also cares the obligatory, all-famous pierogies with several different options for fillings. \n\nWe were first-timers, so we opted for the dinner for two which, at $34, came with two stuffed cabbage orders, two sausages, a beef stew, two buns and eight pierogies. You get two choices for the pierogies, so we asked that our dumplings be stuffed with potatoes and cheese, and also beef. For dinner, the serving size was able. A great amount of food for the both of us. \n\nIt was my first time eating pierogies and I found them to be just OK. They were served with sour cream (interestingly served in a to-go container instead of a more sustainable option), which did not enhance the flavor. Of the two, I like the one stuffed with potatoes and cheese the best. \n\nWhat I loved, loved, loved, however, were two dishes: the stuffed cabbage and the stew. \n\nThe cabbage roll is full of pork and rice, then smothered with a tomato sauce. It was quite delicious! Not rich, but certainly not flat in flavor. I loved that, despite the filling and topping, you could still distinctively taste the cabbage. And the cabbage held its form pretty well, indicating that the dish was made fresh. \n\nThe stew -- I need that recipe! It contains cabbage, beef and I don't know what else. Luscious, deep flavor! I was stuffed, yet found myself wanting another cup of stew. \n\nOn the drink menu, you will find Bulgarian and Romanian Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. There is also a Serbian Riesling and a Tsantali Blanc from Greece. There's also a dessert wine from Croatia. All reasonably priced at less than $6 per glass. There is also a selection of Polish, Slovak and Russian beers. \n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience! And having held the Polish Cottage in my bookmarks for years and years. Don't wait that long to give them a try.",

To be honest, the shopping center is a bit run down and I wasn't sure what to expect. But they definitely had some pretty stellar reviews, so I knew that I eventually had to hit them up. \n\nThere was quite the level of add activity happening in the parking lot when we visited. There were people just sitting the parking lot in chairs that you'd normally see at a tailgate. Only there was no game happening - it was just a Saturday night in a strip center. We couldn't really figure out what was happening there.\n\nBut we headed inside and ordered our food. The good news is that my gyro was delicious, but the bad news is that it strongly smelled like cleaning supplies in here while we were waiting for it to be cooked. You can actually place pick-up orders here through Yelp, so that is definitely what I'll be doing next time. \n\nAnd the loaded fries were not so loaded - more like fries with some feta cheese sprinkled on top. I added some vinegar to them when I got home to spruce them up a bit. They were still tasty, but maybe the name should change to \"feta fries.\"\n\nI'll be back next time I'm craving Greek food, especially now that Simple Greek has closed (RIP.)",

  "text": "I absolutely LOVE Santa Barbara Autowerks, Inc. and can see myself being a loyal customer for years and years to come. \n\nWith the help of my fellow Yelpers, I first called upon SBAW to do an inspection of a used BMW that I was considering purchasing. They did a thorough evaluation, provided honest feedback and helped coordinate pick up and drop off of the vehicle. I ended up purchasing a great car, for a great deal! \n\nFast forward a few months later, I call SBAW in frenzy, as I attempted to rush to a yoga class on my lunch break and couldn't get my keys out of the ignition. After troubleshooting the issue for several minutes myself, I called SBAW, and a very patient, Hector answered the phone and started by asking me kindly if the \"car is in park?\" Why no! It wasn't! A minor detail I neglected to attend to in my haste! As I proclaimed to Hector what an idiot I am and thanked him profusely, he never made me feel stupid and was quite validating. Thank you Hector! \n\nI've had a couple of other routine services since then and am incredibly satisfied with the work these gentlemen have done. Hector and Aaron are gems to work with and they deserve all the accolades bestowed upon them. They're 5-star reputation is well earned! \n\nIf you're looking for a mechanic that you can trust, look no further and call Santa Barbara Autowerks! \n\n(Don't forget to check-in on Yelp while you're there and take advantage of their 10% discount, which can go a long way when you're getting a major service. :D)",

  "text": "So I have logged more flights into and out of RNO than any other 5 people that I know. I started making monthly flights in 1981, on a number of airlines that no longer exist. That lasted for over 10 yrs. Since then I still have flown in a few times a year. I know this airport like the back of my hand for better or worse.\n\nHowever I love it here. This may be the nicest airport that I can remember going to. It is always clean. The lines are nothing like any other place that I have flown to. Reno is the biggest little city for a reason. \n\nThis airport has always had very nice folks working at it across the board, regardless of their being airport staff, an onsite vendor, or working for one of the airlines. I am not sure what has caused this disposition, but I absolutely love it. Flying in or out of here just is pleasant to me. \n\nAfter they built the new parking structures a number of years ago, it got much better here. Pick up and drop off by locals was much more easily done and allows you to enjoy a quick bite to eat or a place to relax while waiting for your flight without having to immediately go to the gate.\n\nAlso like McCarran in Vegas, you can gamble while awaiting your flight. Sadly they don't bring you any free drinks, and it's rare to see someone hit a jackpot, but it is great when someone does. They have all of the typical vendors here with a coffee joint, bar, newsstand, and some type of ever changing grub spot on each concourse.\n\nAs this is the primary destination for people flying in to go skiing/snowboarding in Lake Tahoe, they airline personnel are used to dealing with all kinds of specialty sized equipment. This also includes backpacking equipment of those going into the high country during the spring, summer, and fall.  Having that advantage is huge IMHO and makes life better for the outdoorsy types. \n\nOverall I have nothing bad to say about this place. Regardless of the season, this place is to me the epitome of how an airport should operate.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I, who both love Thai food, decided to check this place out for dinner on a Thursday night. After having read some pretty solid reviews, I couldn't help but be surprised when we left disappointed and unsatisfied with our experience. The food was underwhelming and the service was really... bizarre for a lack of better words. :(\n\nWe were both really overwhelmed when we first started browsing through the menu. They have SO many options, it was nearly impossible to make a decision. After much pondering we each decided to get the Tom Yum soup (I got chicken, she got shrimp) and the Satay Sampler to share. \n\nLet me start with the soup - I knew after just the first couple spoonfuls that I wasn't a fan. We both normally love Tom Yum soup which is why that was the easiest decision for us to make. I felt like the soup was extremely oily with really no flavor. In prior experiences, I've always thought Tom Yum has a little kick to it but this one did not at all. I also felt like there were way too many mushrooms. Such a disappointment. :(\n\nThe Satay Sampler we ordered came with 2 chicken, 2 beef, and 2 shrimp satays with a small bowl of pickled vegetables (carrots and cucumbers) and peanut sauce. While there was nothing specifically wrong with the satay, there was certainly nothing to rave about either. The meat was cooked well, but with no taste at all. The peanut sauce was just your average peanut sauce. Nothing special about that. \n\nFor our entrees, my friend and I both ordered the Green Curry with chicken. Their spice level ranges from 1-7 (I've never seem higher than 5 before?!) so  I got the 5. WHAT A MISTAKE. It was WAY too spicy for me! I don't blame this on the restaurant at all, it was just a poor decision on my part. I'd like to think I can handle spicy food pretty well, but I definitely should have gone with a 4 or maybe even a 3 at Tamarind. My friend can definitely handle very spicy food, but she also felt like a 5 here was a bit much. Just something to keep in mind when making your decision. \n\nSpice aside, the entree was about average. Although it was flavorful and had a decent amount of chicken, the vegetables weren't anything special. Didn't taste quite fresh. \n\nAs far as service goes, I was content with the pace at which our food was brought out. What I found rather strange was that we would have to ask them to remove our plates between dishes. When we were done our appetizers, out empty plates were left at the table while they tried to make room for our entrees. We actually had to request and suggest that they take away our empty, dirty plates to make room. This happened between our soup and appetizer and again between our appetizer and entree. It wasn't very eye appealing to have empty, dirty dishes on our table between orders, not to mention we had practically no room on the table!\n\nOverall, Tamarind didn't really impress me. Let my search for the best Thai restaurant in Philly continue...",

  "text": "Urban Brew and BBQ is a small barbecue joint in downtown St. Pete. The first thing I noticed about Urban Brew's barbeque is that they leave the sauce on the side of their slow cooked smoked meats so that diners can choose their favorite style of BBQ. The BBQ sauces come in a variety of sweet, spicy, smoky, and tangy flavors.\n\nBesides Urban's amazing juicy, tender and flavorful slow cooked smoked meats they offer a variety of classic and gourmet side dishes.  Good lord, these side dishes are so good!!! The Urban Mac N' Cheese and the Pork Belly are out of this world good! The macaroni dish is cooked in a miniature skillet. Genius! A nice selection of craft beers are also available and the selection changes regularly. \n\nThe atmosphere at Urban Brew is very cool and features Augusta Blocks from the streets of St. Pete, tiled penny floors in the bathrooms, a huge mural of Central Avenue and photos of downtown St. Pete from the late 1800's to 1920's. I really appreciate these little details because it adds so much character to the restaurant.\n\nI held back one star because I felt like our meal was a tad expensive for \"beer and BBQ\". I know... I'm a cheap ass. I need to get used to paying $6+ for a beer. Also I would love to see the outdoor beer garden spruced up. Some umbrellas and a few potted plants would make the area so much more inviting.",

Not to mention, they're expensive.\n\nEnter Gardens of Babylon. \nThey were still allowed to function curbside only, and eventually added an online ordering section to their website.\n\nI found it fairly easy to place and pay for my orders online. Once an order was ready (usually in 24 hours), I was asked to pick it up within a specified block of time consisting of a few days. \nThis was (mostly) helpful considering my limited availability and their limited hours of operation at that time.\n\nI ordered rosemary, basil, parsley, cilantro, herb & veggie plant food, organic potting soil, and even pots and saucers!\n\nOn each trip, I would pull up to the front of their nursery and open the back of my vehicle for them to place my order inside. All very socially distanced, all wearing masks; very easy and very safe.\n\nUnfortunately, the product availability wasn't always accurate on their site. I ordered some pots and saucers, then later received a call from the staff advising they did not have the exact items in stock as indicated. So I agreed to accept a substitution. A staff member had to call me again to advise I would have to pay more for the substitution. I reluctantly accepted the charge. I think it would have been best if they had just credited the difference considering it was only a few dollars more.\n\nI think they now permit folks to peruse their garden center since it's outdoors. (Although I'd recommend to call them first to be sure.) \n\nBased on my curbside experiences, I feel fairly confident they are operating safely regardless of restrictions or no restrictions.",

I've never ventured into the botanical gardens, but I can imagine it's a lovely place to capture some floral macro shots.  \n\nOf course there's the museum and sculpture garden as well should you deserve to be get your culture on.  Something free and fun for the kids are the duck ponds.  If you're seeking for some fitness - well maintained running and biking paths are available.  \n\nI think it's a nice place to hang out with some friends and dogs or have a picnic - weather permitting.

We were pleasantly greeted by both our waitress and one of the chefs who was busy making a pizza but stopped to say hello. Nice touch. A stone arch splits the restaurant into half (original in the front, old in the back with a few more comfy booths). The place already had a few occupied tables when we arrived around 6:15pm but the front half was completely full by the time we left.\n\nThe menu is split into appetizers, pizza, pasta and grill. Wanted to try their famous Soprano bread but seeing as there were only two of us, we opted to go big with two 16\" inch pizzas instead. Maybe next time as several tables ordered it!\n\n17 pizzas to choose from. Way too many choices and sadly, I asked the waitress after our meal and they don't let you do half flavours. Bummer. Three sizes to choose from (12\", 14\" and 16\") and price ranges from $15-$30. Prices are on the higher spectrum but this is pretty much on par with Tony's. \n\nNot sure about their pastas - saw a large group of old grannies order a couple different dishes and they looked pretty ordinary. Sometimes you have to stick with what a restaurant does best and here, it's their thin crust pizza.\n\n- Davide's inferno ($25.00 for 16\") - marinated tomatoes, Italian sausage, casalingo salami, mixed blend of cheese and spices. FYI - this one has a four spice level rating. FOUR spice. No big deal right? Well, that's what we thought because normally these things aren't accurate. Well, you've been warned - we both took our first bites and were greeted with a delicious wave of hot chili flakes and spices. Oh and these pizzas come out straight from the oven - maybe wait a minute or two before you start devouring them. I may have slightly burned the top of my mouth - totally worth it. Flavours were great with the variety of meats, sweet tomatoes and spice level. Get it.\n\n- Pizza con spinaci ($25.00 for 16\") - spinach, black olives, a blend of Parmesan, mozzarella and feta cheese. Our only complaint was that the centre turned out a bit soggy. The rest was good as you could taste each ingredient on it's own accord. First time for me having spinach on a pizza - I think I like arugula more so as spinach doesn't have much flavour while arugula has that slight punch of anise. L liked how they used a subtle, neutral tomato sauce to keep things classic. \n\n- Caffe latte ($3.75) - a typical after dinner drink my bud always gets. Smelled great. Add tons of sugar, mix and enjoy. Think of at like a dessert drink.\n\nSimple, homemade and unpretentious fare. Stick with the pizzas and you can't go wrong. Maybe there is hope for pizza in town after all...",

  "text": "When John mentioned that Jennifer from Top Chef used to work here, I got super excited. Google showed me that it wasn't the contestant I'd been thinking of, but I was still curious enough to want to try the place. The wait was close to 45 minutes as estimated, and we eventually got a small table by the window. For lack of supply our table wasn't equipped with the same set of hot sauces as the neighboring tables. Margarita flavors of the day were strawberry or mango, and a pitcher of the latter pleasantly sloshed us by the end of dinner.\n\nI was sad to see that their menu online hadn't been updated with the recent changes. While I understand that it's a pain to keep stock for a vegetarian ingredient that isn't present in any other dishes, I'd been really looking forward to the cactus and sweet potato burrito. Which reminds me, I haven't seen a neighborhood so vegetarian-friendly in a long time. John was gung-ho about what appetizers we were going to get, so I let him take charge of those while I picked out our entrees. Given the amount of food we were about to indulge in, we opted to pass on the endless chips and salsa. As strongly as his roommate recommended the barbecue, I was pretty realistic about our consumption of food and chalked the pork belly off for a later visit.\n\nI've never seen fried pickle chips cut so thick (a hefty quarter-inch), and the texture was right on the border between cuke and pickle. The spicy chili mayo it came with was an okay pairing, nothing special. Of everything on our table it was the least spectacular, and as a result it was the only thing we left unfinished.\n\nThe single order of veggie wings with ranch sauce arrived at the same time as the other app. Celery and carrot sticks were acceptably fresh, though the celery was the lower quality of the two. The seitan was sliced thin and fried to crisps before tossed in buffalo wing sauce. An interesting plate that I was content to eat, but definitely takes an open-minded palate to appreciate. Not sure that I'd get this again, but I'd be tempted to make this at home if I went herbivore.\n\nSince the shrimp and chorizo burritos each came as a pair, we traded our spares to share the entree experience. The radish slices were nice to have, but I was unimpressed by the jicama cabbage slaw. I think my main criticism is that the tortillas tasted straight out of the package. I would've enjoyed each bite more had an attempt been made to lightly grill the wrappers. The chorizo was my favorite of the two; instead of pineapple, it's now served with roasted red potatoes that give it a fantastic rustic flavor. The wedge lime lightened the heaviness of the burrito, and I could totally picture this as an amazing breakfast burrito if scrambled egg were included. The shrimp burrito tasted of very fresh ingredients, but citrus wasn't present enough to make the seafood really pop. Sadly, this made the room-temperature tortilla overwhelm the light flavor of the shrimp.\n\nService was friendly enough to come by to top off our glasses for us despite the packed crowd and the pitcher being right there for our own dispensation. Two bathrooms behind the ATM/cigarette machines, surprisingly clean and tagged with random graffiti that actually fits right in with the feel of the place. The art on the windows made me smile, and the hubbub was too noisy for me to make out the TVs by the bar. I'd be interested in coming back at least one more time for food, and I'd definitely come back for boozing.",

This is a good thing - everything was being freshly prepared in the kitchen!\n\nMy lentil soup was very good, but was NOT like the traditional version that I was expecting, and, it was . . . GREEN!

Vegetable dumplings in a cashew sauce.  It was sooooo good!  (I dipped some of my Naan in).\n\nSpeaking of which, the Naan was good but I wish they had offered one with spinach and cheese (my favorite, at the now closed :(, Inde Blue).  \n\nI'm not sure if Dinner Bell has desserts.

  "text": "Having gone from trying a slice to ordering a whole pie, I must say I could hardly have hoped for better. The specials list here rotates daily, and I ended up with a close to perfect (albeit very salty) pizza, topped with something sweet and flavorful called a \"peppadew\" and a lot of arugula, which created a wonderfully balanced flavor and made me feel better about ordering garlic knots instead of a salad. The garlic knots were pretty rad.\n\nIt took close to forty minutes to get my pizza on a midweek evening. It was worth it, but I would caution anyone that this place is busy and takes time. I would also check the special of the day, as it rotates and there's always a vegan pie; which as much as I like their regular pizza I may try some day.",

  "text": "They had me right off the bat: as soon as I walked in I was offered spiced tea or champagne. *This* is how you make a good impression. Properly besotted with my beverage of choice, there was no way I was leaving without making a purchase. Business owners take note: a small investment yielded a ten-fold (at least) return. If I was offered drinks each time I entered a boutique, I would spend a lot more money. Not only am I relaxed at that point, it's rather rude to not spend money after being given a gift. We *are* in the south. Manners matter.\n\nSo, I'd never heard of Color before. Score one for Yelp. This stretch of road in Green Hills is, typically, my cut through to get to the mall so I don't have to wait for the bottleneck on Hillsboro. I never thought to look left and notice that there were/are businesses as I race past at breakneck speed.* Color is one of those fantastic holiday-ready catch-alls: home goods, gifts, jewelry... you name it (in those categories) and Color has it. The store isn't huge but for its size and in those categories, there's a nice selection from which to choose/shop. The aesthetic is feminine and southern so if you're buying for a southern lady, you've got it made in the shade. I saw runners, glasses, pillows, mirrors, and tableware that would have all been big hits. As it was, I found a unique statement bracelet and a charming wreath that were, both, big hits on Christmas morning.\n\nThe demographic may be specific but if you're buying for someone in that demo, you're home free. You're sure to find *something* that she'd enjoy. Plus, you live in Nashville. Odds are there is a southern woman in your life. Shop for her home/wrist/neck/fingers/ears here. Guaranteed she'll like whatever you find. And, lastly: kudos to Color for being the consummate hosts and offering refreshments just for walking through the door. That made a big impression on me and that service carried forward as I shopped. As a man who eschews shopping unless it's avoidable, Color made something painful enjoyable and earned a return customer for its efforts.\n\n*Just kidding. I always go the speed limit.",

It's a suburban size supermarket smack in the city. I should probably hold off on this review until I go back a few more times, but I feel like I haven't shut up about it in real life so I may as well go ahead and blab about it in Yelp life. \n\nSo I knew they were getting a beer bar, but I had no idea they were getting a bottle shop too. The selection was pretty decent and the prices were fair market value in PA. Goose Island Juliet at $24...I'm coming back for you dear...\n\nI've yet to try any of the little restaurant areas, but how could being able to get Dizengoff's in the heart of Fairmount be a bad thing? \n\nThe salad bar was on steroids in comparison to their former location. Although, they didn't have hardboiled egg on a Sunday morning; that's a fail. \n\nSame with the soup bar. There were far more fresh soups than were previously offered.\n\nIn general, all the hot food and made-to-order foods looked bigger, brighter and are hopefully better. \n\nAnd this is my whole view from just the first section of the store. I'm sure I'll write an update once the dust settles. And yes, there was dust flying around the area for months...I suffered through it. For now, I'm smitten with the bright, shiny and new.",

  "text": "If you can stand the wait on a Sunday for brunch on a sun shiny day without wanting to dabble in cannibalism (eating off someone's limb out of sheer hanger), then Boathouse is a nice retreat from the more populated area of SB. \n\nTo help curb your insatiable appetite while waiting for a table, get yourself a Bloody Mary (the one with the fatty meets crispy bacon strip and shrimp). It's the perfect way to tide you over for an hour and if you can snag a seat at either side of the bar, then you'll be in heaven.\n\nWhen you finally do get a seat and order, be prepared for the food to come out quick. The kitchen does a phenomenal job of firing out the dishes. The Huevos Hope Ranch was a stellar dish (two fried eggs, crispy tortilla, black beans, avocado, sour cream, queso fresco & Boathouse breakfast potatoes). It was a good lookin' one, too. I also ordered the French toast as an amuse bouche, but would prob skip this next time as there wasn't anything spectacular about it.\n\nIf you opt to sit outside and the sun is a blazin' and you volunteer yourself for the shadeless seat because you think the brisk SB ocean breeze will cool you down, you will very much regret that decision about 15-30 minutes in. I was definitely feeling the heat half way through my meal and there was nothing the Blood Orange Margarita could do about it...unless I chose to pour it on my body instead of in my mouth, but that didn't seem like the classy Sunday brunch thing to do.",

Also, with Commander's location out in the Garden District it doesn't, to me at least, have that Big Easy feeling about it.\n\nI know, my review is permeated with nothing but subjectivity, but that is the way I feel about. As for food, no doubt about it, innovative as well as top quality, top notch all the way, but I could do without all the seemingly unnecessary fanciness of the place; too much akin to the swank of upper East Side New York than the understated elegance of style I think of as more traditional to New Orleans.\n\nWill I be back?

The lady behind the counter let us take our time making our selections and asked if we were local since they have a frequent diner card of some kind. The brightly colored building was well-air-conditioned (whew!) and 100% spotless.\n\nMy only complaint was the lack of salt on the homemade waffle chips as I think potatoes without NaCl is somehow wrong. Plus, chips taste a heck of a lot better with it! On the plus side, the chips were super crispy which is a good thing! It was easily solved with some salt and pepper from the shakers.\n\nI enjoyed my Cuban sandwich which was flavorful, unique, crunchy and tasty. It was worth the visit to find this well-off-the-beaten path known-only-to-locals-and-yelpers spot! My wife's bowl-based-meal was based on black beans which were also under-seasoned so she was less happy with her meal.",

  "text": "Two of my friends lost a life dear to them, so I decided to send them a plant in memory of their beloved.\n\nI researched florists in their area, and noted Scentaments has primarily good reviews. But I ultimately chose them because of their large variety of plants offered.\n\nHeartLeaf Philodendrons are one of my favorite house plants, and I was elated to find Scentaments offers them! So I chose one for my friends since it is easy to care for with a little insight, and can last many years without much fuss.\n\nA few hours after I placed the order, I received a text from my friends thanking me for the plant I sent. I was very impressed on how quickly it was delivered!\n\nUnfortunately, I later learned they had received a Peace Lily instead of a HeartLeaf Philodendron. While the Peace Lily is the same price, and it looks absolutely beautiful from the picture I was shown, it is still NOT what I ordered for them. In fact, there was another florist I had been eying and their prices are lower, but they do not sell HeartLeaf Philodendrons. If I had known Scentaments was going to send whatever, I would've used the other florist and saved myself about $7.\n\nLook, I have nothing against Peace Lilies -- in fact, I really like them a lot. But what if one of my friends is allergic to them? Or what if one of them had expressed to me long ago that they don't like Peace Lilies? \n\nMy point is this...when you order something like a dish garden, it's a crap-shoot, right? You're not sure what you're going to get. But when you order something specific that not every florist in town has - like a HeartLeaf Philodendron - that's what you expect. At least, that's what I expect.\n\nScentaments isn't the first to do this, and sadly I know they won't be the last. It's just really disappointing in the forever gamble of Middle Tennessee florists. \n\nMaybe next time I'll buy my plant from a local nursery and have Uber deliver it for me. It will cost about the same in the end.",

Many moons ago, Gap switched their house credit card over to a Gap Visa where you earn gift rewards for shopping in the store. The card has a good percentage rate, so I held on to it for large purchases. I recently got a rewards certificate to go Gap shopping. \n\nMy recent shopping experience was some what disappointing. I found nothing in the clearance/sale section, so I moved on to the short sleeve sport shirts. I could always use a colorful Madras Plaid shirt for attending a summer cookout or Yelp Event. I found a couple that I liked and was ready to go until I tried them on. \n\nI've been dieting and have lost 30 lbs., but when I went to try a large on, it was too small. What? Even when I was fatter, I did not wear an extra-large. Size is a mental game, even if I liked the shirt, there is no way was I going to buy an extra-large.  So, I was back to browsing the store. \n\nMy eyes immediately were drawn to the back corner where they had colorful socks and boxers/briefs displayed. I've been thinning out and redoing my sock inventory, so this was a win. I have to wear an uniform to work, so I love accessorizing with colorful socks. \n\nThe service today was bare bones, I did not see a sales associate until I was at the cash wrap ready to check out. Again, I remember the days when they would be assisting, suggesting and working to build that sale. \n\n* Side note - I found a shirt at Tommy Bahamas and I got to buy a MEDIUM. Why can't the fashion industry use the same sizing standards and guidelines?",

For a 45 minute wait, the pizza was ok compared to all the pizza spots in West Philly. \n\nClarksville is going for a lowkey gourmet pizza spot, but is lacking some finishing touches. The crust is good, but I didn't care for the actual texture. My daughter's pepperoni pizza was great, but I didn't care for the veggie pizza my wife ordered. It was loaded with too much of one veggie and not much variety. \n\nThe manager gave us a donut hole inspired dessert dish with a caramel dip with coconut shavings and i was fantastic.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  \nWe were in town to see a show on St. Patrick's day and decided we wanted to come here with a party of 8.  They do have call ahead seating for parties larger than 5 so after the show let out I called us in and they told me an hour an a half.  We were already set to come so I put our name on the list.   We showed up maybe 15-20 minutes later and got our buzzer and I informed the host that we'd be flexible if there would be 2 tables next to each other that we didn't all need to sit at one table if it meant getting sat sooner.  He said he'd see what he could do. Within minutes he came to us with a table ready.  All together too!  Apparently there was a large party also waiting but they found happiness in the bar and said we could have their table!  YAHOO!  \nFor such a large party too our server was great.  We did one check but she was willing to split if needed and that was nice to know.  We ordered drinks and apps and our meals and everything came out in a timely manner.  I'm always amazed at the size of this menu.  It has literally everything you can think of from Italian to regular American dishes and everything I've tried has been tasty.  They pride themselves on making things from scratch and hardly using processed ingredients which for a large menu I'd think would be hard to do and execute well.  They somehow seem to be able to do it.  I got chicken parm on this visit and it was wonderful and plentiful!  They have really yummy bread too and I ordered some crinkle fries because I saw them being enjoyed at another table and I wanted to enjoy them too.  I know it doesn't go but they are shareable and they were so worth it!  On this visit we also got dessert.  I tried the canollis and they were fab!  Ron's is a must stop when in the area.

I highly suggest getting the 100% maple syrup for an additional 1.25 cause it's WORTH IT. It comes in a tiny resealable bottle if you have any leftover syrup to take home. \n\nBelgian waffle is indeed airy and fluffy as it's titled on the menu! Ask for it with the trifecta and it'll hit the spot. Don't be afraid to ask your eggs done how you like because they will cook it exactly as you want!

  "text": "Clang, clang, clang went the trolley!  Oh wait, that was in St. Louis.  Here on the St. Charles Ave streetcar line, it's more like \"Screech, screech, screech\"as the car navigates turns or a sort of buzzer-like \"EEEHHHH\" when someone signals for a stop.  And the second car I was on had a peculiar whirring noise which made me think I was sitting on top an alien power source.\n\nNoise issues aside (and who am I to judge, as anyone who's heard my stomach after I've had Tibetan food will tell you), this isn't a bad mode of transport.\n\nIf you're a tourist, it's a great deal for $1.25 a ride or $3 for a day pass.  Going through the Garden District and by the Zoo and Loyola, you get to see many beautiful buildings and homes.  The leisurely pace will calm you and help you jump out of the rat race, if only for a moment.\n\nOverall, the times I rode it (admittedly prior to a Saints game) it was very crowded, although people were friendly, even as they stuck their asses in your face.  As others have said, sometimes you have to wait for a few to go by until you can squeeze on one.\n\nI'd advise you to take a ride on this streetcar.",

They have plenty of your favorite dishes to choose from.. roast pork, stew chicken and beef, tripe, chicarrones, ribs, epanadillas, stew goat, puplo salad.. the selections are great..They also serve fresh fruit drinks, and have decent desserts.... I stopped in today with my son, had a meal and he left with coconut cake... \nThe appearance looks more like a corner store, you'll see people from all walks of life coming through to buy meals, and parking there is a challenge.. But the food is well worth it..\nFriendly service and they do serve drinks in the restaurant... I'll go as far as calling this place a local gem since you can't find any Puerto Rican food outside of the Camden/Philly city limits....",

  "text": "If you are one of my Yelp friends you can see that everytime I go to Lakeside Mall I always park at Macy's.  And most likely in the same spot because I'm getting old and a creature of habit so I park in the same spot every single time no matter what store I need to go to.  It works for me, don't judge!\n\nAnywho, the parking is plentiful which is great because this is the busiest mall in the greater NOLA area in my opinion.  Plus I get to walk through my favorite part of the department store, the purses and shoes!  Now I'm not really a department store shopping kind of gal.  If I know what I\"m looking for then I refuse to pay retain unless there is a sale and will hunt something down at TJ Maxx, Marshall's, Stein Mart etc.  But if I get a gift card at Macy's then I will be more than happy to use it!  In fact for Christmas I received two gift cards here and treated myself to a rose gold Fossil watch with a large face.  The sales lady was kind enough take out the links so it fit my tiny wrist.  I have a penchant for huge watches which can be annoying bc I have such a small wrist. They have great customer service as well!  When I had to return something for store credit I had one sales lady who walked me from her spot all the way upstairs to where I needed to be.  I told her manager how awesome she was!\n\nAnother bonus is that over the Christmas holiday when stores were open ridiculously late, I found that Macy's was open later than any store in the mall which was awesome because this is where I park!  I have this fear of being trapped in the mall store and having to exit the store and circumvent the entire mall to get to my car walking aimlessly with my poor sense of direction in the dark! hehe...fortunately this never happens since I park at Macy's at the same spot and they're open late!\n\nOk, enough about Macy's.  Btw, I have been to the original Macy's in NYC and it is pretty mind boggling.  I consider myself quite versed in malls and stores and have been to the Mall of America in Minnesota and even the Mall in Asia (largest mall in asia) but trust me when I say the Macy's in NYC is in a class of it's own!  Makes me wish that Marshall Field's still existed in Chicago. *sigh*\n\nHappy shopping!",

The staff was quick to great me when I came in , and quick to take my order when I was ready! Excellent and friendly customer service!                 I ordered the super nachos to eat there and a large burrito to go.  The nachos were very good, the asked if I wanted everything on them. I did . They came on an oval plate , arranged to cover the plate. The ingredents were fairly evenly spread over the entire plate.The chips and all of the other ingredients seemed to be pretty fresh! I wish that the meat was just a little bit spicer! They were better than many more costly super nachos that I have had elsewhere!  ( Note to self, eat the center first , as it gets a bit soggy if you eat it last! )                                                                                  Now for the Burrito.  Large is HUGE ! I ate off of it three times! They asked if I wanted beans,rice,onion,etc. on it and I did. I like the way they make the burrito , because the ingredents are mixed and not in clumps , so that you get a little bit of everything in every bite!

The suit worked out great and they let you leave it at your hotel (if in the area) for them to pick up.

Lots of good seasoning and very crispy.  As for the pizza, we tried the White Hibiscus pizza. WOW. This is how I want a white pizza served.

It's sushi roll burritos though with the stuff you usually get in a sushi roll.  I got the spicy yellowtail and it was so good and spicy but I think eating just half of it made me sleepy but I also had the miso soup.  It literally is a burrito in replacement with rice.  It was so good though and a variety of fish options as well as chicken.  I'm wondering if you can order it without the rice and just the sushi paper- that would be ideal.   It appears that you can make it however you want it, I went with  the spicy yellowtail option they had.  \n\nParking is easy and it's away from the crowded part of State Street in fact it's way up there.

We know how to have a party and yet we know the importance of spirituality (and repentance).  Whenever I'm in the area, I stop in for a moment or two and offer a prayer to my two very Roman Catholic grandmothers and light candles in their honor.  My Granny was convinced that a candle at the cathedral carried more weight than a candle from another church.\n\nThe church is a beautiful example of early architecture and it definitely deserves a tour and a donation!  But remember it is still a functioning church, so if you are visiting be respectful of those who are there to pray.  Check out the gift shop while you're there.",

Would definitely recommend if you need a comfortable place to get some work done.",

We shared the pork belly buns (um, like ribs chopped and stuffed into plain bao) and peruvian ceviche (this was the highlight of the meal - perfectly fresh, creamy, and accented with sweet potato) for the appetizer course.  I got the parihuela, which I suppose is the Latin version of bouilliabaise (w/saffron,, of course).  It was decent but a tad on the bland side.  I sampled the smoked sirloin, which was better, with a delicious miso butter.  It was also generously sized.  The lychee sangria added a nice touch to the meal.  Overall, a decent experience but nothing spectacular.",

The main reason for why we didn't was because it is a smaller menu - makes sense now.\n\nInstead, we had seen some amazing photos of bread pudding so we thought we'd get that after dining elsewhere. The host was very gracious in letting us know upon our arrival that they did not have bread pudding at this time but handed us a their current dessert menu to browse.\n\nIt was late, almost close to closing time so we thought we'd just get the Dark Chocolate Truffle Cookies to go. They asked us a couple of times if we were sure and offered to set up a table for us, but we declined. I'll say that the cookies were absolutely delicious & if they're anything like the rest of the food, we would've really enjoyed our meals!\n\nI'm going to keep this on my list so we can try it out in the future when we return!",

  "text": "I liked this place a lot and I don't even like Korean food. Expensive AF tho. \n\nVisited on 8-14-18 at 5:30PM. This place is kinda hidden behind the new Verizon store on Brandon Blvd between Lakeview and Kings. It looks like they're trying really hard to make it look nice but just dont have much of a budget. They've painted the interior black but have cheaply re-upholstered brown chairs, twinkle lights, Ikea fixtures... cheaply done but they're trying. \n\n Service from Randy was friendly, efficient, and knowledgable. $55.70 got us one bottle of beer, one sushi roll, and two entrees. My husband wanted to get the AYCE bbq but everybody at the table has to do it (boo!).\n\nThe banchan here is off the hook yummy. We were brought fish cakes, kimchi, cucumbers, radish, bean sprouts, and spinach. I could have happily ordered another of each one because they were fresh and tasty. \n\nWe started out with the $6.95 yaki mandoo which was advertised as fried vegetable dumplings. The dumplings were very large and perfectly fried. The filling looked like cabbage, carrots, and some sort of meat. I'm not a strict vegetarian so it didn't bother me but if you are, beware of the sneaky meat. \n\nI had the $14.95 japchae noodles. It was sweet potato starch noodles (clear glass noodles) stir fried with veggies. It had small bits of meat, onions, carrots, bok choy, spinach, and sesame seeds. The dish was an enormous portion and served piping hot. All the ingredients tasted light and fresh. The noodles were slightly sweet and cooked perfectly. I enjoyed it a lot and had enough leftovers for two more meals. \n\nNot a bad meal but for the price I wouldn't go back.",

The place is covered in Dr. Bob's artwork, service was laid back and extremely friendly- Robert was our waiter and he was great. He even gave us some extra shrimp to go with our fried green tomatoes because we had more people than we did shrimp- and they were big, fresh suckers. This place does decadence right.\n\nFor a table of five we ordered one of every lunch appetizer and double praline bacon. I have no words for how amazing the bacon is. Sweet and salty and perfect. Put a strip in your bloody mary. Boudin balls and fried green tomatoes were both winners. I tried fried chicken livers for the first time and while they haven't won me over yet, the pepper jelly they came with was great. The only real miss were the fried oysters with blue cheese; the oysters themselves were perfect but I don't think the cheese went well with them.\n\nThe fried catfish was so tender that is practically fell apart before even making it to your mouth. I ordered a special consisting of fried eggplant topped with poached eggs that was delicious. But the star of the show was the french toast burrito. I NEED this in NY, it's just not fair. They take a tortilla, dip it in the french toast egg wash, cover with cinnamon, fry it up, and stuff it with eggs, sausage, and that life changing praline bacon. Cover the enormous thing with maple syrup and powdered sugar. I'm not religious but I felt blessed just to have tasted it.",

  "text": "[Preface] \nAnyone who has been watching the whole Yelp photos conversation will appreciate the fact that I made the decision to go to Santa Fe this evening because it was the first business I found in the mobile app that didn't have a photo uploaded. John L will appreciate the fact that I uploaded two dark, blurry, almost useless photos. \n\n[Background]\nOver the course of the last several years, the building that now exists as Santa Fe was a succession of different restaurants -- it was [insert name I'm forgetting], then Nonna Mia's (I think), then Santa Fe. My memory fails me with regard to the details (clearly), but the point is there were a bunch of different businesses in this location, and Santa Fe was the only one that stuck since I've been paying attention. \n\n[Rumors/Hearsay]\nIn any event, the first feedback I heard from other people who'd been to Santa Fe was entirely negative. (I won't repeat some of the more colorful statements, entertaining as they may have been; suffice it to say that the food was allegedly not good.) Therefore, I fully expected to see another restaurant take its place rather quickly, and was puzzled when this did not happen. Eventually, I came up with the theory that they *must* have kickass margaritas, because if the food is as bad as I'd heard it was, then people keep going back because they have an awesome time, love the margaritas, and drink so many they either don't care or can't remember whether or not the food was any good. \n\n[Personal Experience]\nWell, I finally had a chance to experience Santa Fe firsthand, and here is what I have to report: \n\n-It's a bustling place, and can get kind of loud if you sit inside, because people clearly come here and have fun (again, I suspect it's the margaritas). \n\n-In all the times I've been to this building in its various incarnations, I've never seen it so crowded and noisy (in a good way). \n\n-There's an amazing, huge, gorgeous outdoor seating area with ceiling fans, tiki torches and (tonight, at least) live music. There was a wait to get a table outside. \n\n-The food is pretty standard Mexican fare. I had nachos, which were pretty much indistinguishable from nachos I've had elsewhere. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food, so whatever people were complaining about years ago is no longer valid (if, of course, it ever was).\n\n-The service was very friendly and helpful, but a tad slow. (They were busy, though, and everybody was running around doing stuff. It's understandable.)\n\n-We were greeted by a woman who, I suspect, is one of the owners.

It's a nice touch.\n\n-They probably have excellent margaritas, but I can't say for sure because I (unfortunately) didn't have one. \n\n[Conclusion]\nOverall, it's a great place, and the only reason I'm giving three stars instead of four is because I need to go back and confirm they do indeed have incredible margaritas, at which point I'll update my review accordingly. \n\n[Next Steps]\nI'm going back soon for a pitcher (or two) of Margaritas.\n\n[Recommendation]\nMy advice: Go. Soon. Before it gets too cold to enjoy eating and drinking outside. \n\n[Post-Script]\nThis place totally should've been included in the \"Yelping Alfresco\" edition of the New Orleans Weekly Yelp. It shall appear in round two, should there ever be a round two.",

They have their bins of specific stuff all in the same area. You go through the clothes and some are really good prices, some are really pricey. You just have to know which ones to pick, and what price you want to spend. I notice they have orange and yellow tags on that day that are 1/2 off. That's an added price saver there. I would definitely be back if I am in the area.",

Your about to cash in and you don't have a care in the world about your eating plan and you got a plenty of Peppermil comp dollars and your ready to stuff your faces with no regrets!  \n\nThis NY Style \"sports deli\" has got you covered with plenty of big portions and big meatballs.  I hadn't eaten a meatball sandwich in a hot minute so we ordered......\n\nThe Wiseguy Meatball Sandwich with your choice of bread all baked in-house.  No GF options were available in case you request that.  I highly recommend asking for extra in house made marinara sauce for this sandwich.  It needs it!  The jalapeño cheese roll is an OK choice but when you stack it up with those big meatballs the regular white roll holds up much better!  We tried both rolls.  \n\nThe cheesytastic pepperoni baguette pizza has that delicious marinara sauce.  It's the sauce.  Definitely not a traditional NY Style pie but you'll be full for at least a couple hours.  \n\nSave room in your gut for later!  Plenty of sweets as well like their \"personal size\" pecan or banana cream pies.  They both sell out quick so you can request the friendly staff to set aside something for you to buy when your ready to bail. \n\nA 4 star deli for your belly for anyone looking to drown their sorrows or savor their victories!  Do it now and ask for forgiveness later.  Warning be aware of those hangry salty customers on the weekend.",

I knew that I must visit the Castle! I exited I-74 into a small town named \"Brownsburg.\"\n\nIt was just after 3:00 pm when I walked in - a couple of other folks were in line in front of me.

I was expecting something hotter and fresher tasting. The Onion chips were fresh and hot - and nice and crisp. The Coke was icy and refreshing.\n\nSomewhat disappointing given that I don't get to experience White Castle that often - when I do - I want it to be a phenomenal fast food experience!",

The guy I went out with had dined there several times and the owner and staff welcomed him with open arms.  In fact, they showed us to the \"engagement table,\" where they claimed many first dates occurred in which the couple later got engaged.  Mmm-hmm.  Probably one of the more awkward moments of the date...\n\nLuckily, the food (and wine that I was now guzzling at warp-speed) made up for any weirdness.  My date asked if I liked mushrooms, and when I said no, he insisted on ordering the mushroom appetizer anyway and promised I would like it.  Ooohkay.  \n\nI had to hand it to the guy, the \"crepe con funghi\" was good.  Points.  He also recommended the homemade gnocchi, which I believe is a special and made from cheese instead of potatoes.  Of course, being the stubborn girl that I am, I went for the ravioli instead.  Which were good, but not as good as the gnocchi, which I stole from my dining companion's plate at every opportunity.    \n\nThe tiramisu that was given to us \"on the house\" was to-die.  \n\nThere was a love connection made that night, only it wasn't with my date.  But I will be forever grateful to him for introducing me to this charming little Italian BYO.  Swoon.",

  "text": "Man. It's been a LONG time since I have been to PM! So when my friend and I needed a stop for our Friday night Restaurant Week adventure, we decided to enjoy the 3 course meal for $20.13 offered here!\n\nWe were able to grab a table a little after 6pm and ordered the white and red sangria. YUM. Very tasty and a healthy portion for sure! Great start. We decided to have the shrimp spring rolls and moo shu quesadilla to start and wow, they did not disappoint! I loved the sauces on the side and we knew we were off to a solid start! \n\nFor entrees we decided on the green curry with chicken and the salmon teriyaki with veggies. I ordered my green curry spicy, and it was even though the heat kinda floated to the bottom of the bowl. I have to admit I didn't love the broth, it seemed a bit watered down (maybe from all the restaurant week orders?) and I was let down. The salmon was good, and I definitely grabbed more than one bite from my friend's plate.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the tempura brownie bite with caramel and my friend the coconut sticky rice with mango. Both were good but not great.  Probably wouldn't order it off the menu again. \n\nI always say that your appetizers shouldn't outshine the main course. I feel it should be a delicious and amazing build up to the grand finale that is your main dish. In this case, I was wishing I could have done a re-do of the appetizers.  \n\nWhat brought it down to 3 stars is that they rushed us out the door. I HATE when I'm still working on a course and the next one is brought out to me. Give me a minute or two please! And they weren't completely slammed or anything when we were here. \n\nOverall, not bad. I'd like to come back and have a refresher on the sushi!",

Rickety looking old wooden buildings, ivy taking over in spots, large logs for seating outside, some picnic type tables, and benches too; tables and stools inside.  Dusty during summer, damp in the winter.\n\nWe had first passed by during a wine tour.  After the tour, we immediately made our way back to indulge in this experience.  The bar/tavern is adjacent to the restaurant.  We had just had lunch on the wine tour; our time was spent at the tavern.  The smell from the bbq wofted throughout. Live music outside and a line at the bar(s) inside.  Cold beer, happy people, all walks of life.  People all about with people leaving and arriving at a steady pace.  This is a place to return when in the area again. \n\nIt's not hard to find, just awkward.  Expect windy roads and a grand curve and at the apex is Cold Spring Tavern.  Parking sucks, let's be honest.  If arriving by car, you'll need to find off pavement parking along the road; no sidewalk; precarious walking up the road with traffic both directions.  On motorcycle, no problem, pull right in, usually.  \n\nAs soon as I find my pics, I'll post.",

  "text": "My husband and I were in Reno last weekend celebrating our wedding anniversary and we originally planned on booking massages at our hotel spa -- that is, until we saw the prices.  So we looked around for alternatives and came up with Healing Wizdom.  For the same price as a half hour massage at our hotel spa, we got a full hour here.  Plus 5% off for booking together  :)\n\nIt was a little hard to find, but the GPS got us there and after a bit of poking around, we found it inside the little \"mall\".\n\nThe receptionist is very friendly and the place is a little on the hippie side but still cozy and inviting.  We didn't have to wait around before being brought in to our treatment rooms.  My masseuse was Matt and he did a terrific job.  He was very courteous, attentive, and thorough.  Probably one of the best massages I've ever gotten, actually.  He also integrated some hot stones into the routine which I've never had before -- it was a very nice touch.  \n\nThe treatment rooms are relaxing, although not very soundproof -- I could hear people in the front office talking the whole time.  But it wasn't really bothersome.\n\nAfter the massage, we were given some really good herbal tea that tasted like apples & cinnamon.  After a weekend of breathing smoky casino air, it was pretty soothing on my poor throat.\n\nThe only thing I found the place lacking was a shower facility -- after a massage, the last thing you want to do is put your clothes back on when you're all greasy!  Ha ha I know, I know....first world problems, right?  So yeah.  They still get 5 stars.  Next time we're in Reno, we will definitely make another appointment.",

As soon as I got as taste of the deliciousness that is The Big Cheezy, I knew that this would have to be my 1100th review.\n\nIt took me forever to get here and when I finally did it was on a Thursday at about 7. I was thrilled that there was no one else here, so we were able to order quickly with zero wait. I had looked over the menu before I came, so I knew exactly what I wanted. The Flying Dutchman was in my future. With ingredients like gouda, turkey and bacon, it seemed like a no brainer. My dining companion wasn't so sure, but after a few minutes he decided to get the Crazy Old Goat, which was packed with goat cheese, monterey jack, bacon, grilled peppers and red pepper jelly. That sounded pretty amazing as well. We also got some waffle fries to munch on the side.\n\nBecause we are smart, we decided that we would split our sandwiches so we both got to taste both. We sat down and we didn't have to wait long at all because there was literally no one else in the place. As soon as the sandwiches came out I was SO excited. Gooey cheese was oozing our of the sides of both of these sandwiches. I could tell that the bread had been buttered (the only way to do it) and the sandwiches looked simple but delicious.\n\nFirst I bit into my Flying Dutchman. There was so much cheese on this thing and it was melted perfectly. The cheese mixed with the turkey and the bacon to create and amazing and delectable experience. After I finished my half, I couldn't wait to switch. The Crazy Old Goat was so different! I loved how the cheese and the bacon made for a savory experience, the peppers added a little kick and the red pepper jelly added a bit of spicy sweetness. There was a lot happening on this thing and I loved every bit of it.\n\nBoth sandwiches that I tried were incredible and I can't wait to go back and try some more of The Big Cheezy menu. I would definitely suggest going later in the day, if you are like me and have no time for a line.",

I ordered sea salt oolong tea with mango bubbles.  They have about a dozen different bubbles, jellies, puddings to choose from.  The flavored popping bubbles encased fruit juice and weren't like the usual chewy tapioca balls.  The sea salt tea is their specialty and I have not seen it else where.  The tea is topped with fresh whipped cream that is slightly salty to contrast to the lightly sweetened tea and garnished with a dash of matcha.  I will go lighter on the cream next time.  There is no cloyingly sweet syrup saturated with bright colors here, which is why their menu seems limited.",

There is a large porch that you climb a few steps to from the free street parking out front.  Once inside, you see the room where they have cookie doughs for visitors to buy.  To the right is a prep room where the guy who waited on us was busy but stopped what he was doing to help us.  A third room around the corner contained a counter with baked cookies that was what we were looking for.  \n\nI really liked that they had bite sized samples of several cookie types available.  My wife selected a thick and softer chocolate chip cookie.  I picked a peanut butter cookie and a combo raisin/cranberry cookie that were also very good.\n\nThe young man who worked there was friendly and helpful and I appreciate that he was able to attend to us promptly without making us feel rushed.\n\nI think if my wife and I liked eating cookie dough, this place might even get a higher rating, but since we only like our cookies fully baked, we will settle on a 4-star rating with only the limit on the number of options keeping it from being a 5-star.\n\nReview #2641",

  "text": "I've heard some good things from a few co-workers about Co Do Hu so  I finally went with a friend for lunch on a Wednesday. Place was pretty busy but we were seated right away.\n\nWe each knew what we wanted and ordered:\n\n- Pho ga ($10) - comes with your usual bean sprout/basil side dish. My bowl had a massive amount of noodles in it (not that I'm complaining). Broth was tasty but a bit on the salty side.  Good broth but not the best in Edmonton.\n- Won ton soup ($10) - My friend had this and she liked it. Came with a bunch of won tons and some mystery type meats. The kicker was she didn't know how hot those chili side bowls are and she put in 4-5 scoops! Oh man, rookie mistake. She managed to eat it though (trooper!) and took the rest for leftovers for another day.\n\nAnyways, place is your typical Vietnamese restaurant. Fast service, good prices and good food. Will definitely be back to try more things as it is close to my work. Beats everything else in the area.",

  "text": "It has been over 20 years since I have been to Santa Barbara but when I had a week with Pismo Beach as my home base, it was the perfect chance to go for a day trip.  Unfortunately that day happened to be during a heat wave limiting how much time we were going to spend outdoors.  \n\nThe fusion aspect of Blue Owl was what intrigued me but found out that my first choice of the red curry tofu and shrimp sandwich was medium on the spice level because of the red curry sauce.  Since I only tolerate mild, sweating more from spicy food was not a good idea eating outside when it was going to reach 100.  Womp, womp.   Although not fusion as I wanted, I did inhale a delicious eggplant sandwich with a Thai Ice Tea and had a bite of a just as delicious pork banh mi.  \n\nWhat really impressed me was our server noticed me trying to fish out a flower that fell into my Thai Ice Tea from the tree I was sitting under and he actually offered to bring me a new one.  Since I was already halfway done, I did say half would be sufficient.  Now that is attentive service.",

  "text": "Walking in here yesterday took me back to my childhood.  A time when I gleefully said \"Yes\" when mom asked if I wanted to go with her to K-Mart.  I knew my reward for accompanying her would be, at best, a G.I. Joe figure, or a delicious Slush Puppy icee at the very least.  Prices didn't register with me since I was just a wee lad and momski was picking up the tab.  I can only assume the prices were decent because we drove over the Gandy Bridge into Pinellas to hit K-Mart, totally whizzing right by the Zayre which closer to home.  I suppose Zayre and K-Mart then is much like Target vs. Walmart today.  Pros and cons to each.\n\nLiterally, the last time I stepped into a K-Mart was 1996.  I was doing some price comparison on household items between K-Mart and the new-to-the-area Wal-Mart.  What I found was that Wal-Mart had much better prices, and a much larger selection.  So why did I stop in this location yesterday?  Convenience.  I was at Lowe's next door and figured it couldn't hurt to look for a few items I needed since it was right there.  Big mistake.  The store had a strong mothball aroma, the aisles were poorly stocked, selections were severely limited and the prices were far from a bargain.  I walked out almost as quickly as I arrived.\n\nIf they're still around in another 20 years, I might stop in to see if anything has changed.",

  "text": "I haven't eaten here again since Gorden Ramsay did his makeover but I ate here several times before then.  Nothing here was outstanding but nothing was terrible.  This is an unassuming typical Metairie strip mall type of place with pretty mediocre food.  The seafood dishes often seemed to be lacking and I generally opted for their other options which were alright but not quite worth the price.  The only thing I really liked about this place is the servers were generally very friendly and authentic NOLA Yat-tastic.  I might check it out again to see if Gorden was able to make any lasting improvements in the joint but my prior experiences left me very unimpressed.",

  "text": "I've been sitting on this one for awhile now...how much do I give to ambiance and a lakeside view?  Does it trump over an average meal?  \n\nRick's is the only place in Indy where you have a pseudo-feeling that you're dining in a lake town.  It's a pretty awesome sight to take in, and I wish the food reflected that.  I settled on the Spicy Plum Glazed Jumbo Shrimp, which was served with coconut rice.  It was pleasant-tasting, but there wasn't anything in particular that had the foodie in me spazzing out.  Perhaps the plum sauce needs an extra kick.\n\nAlso, with all of the ingredients and variety of dishes, I'm curious as to where Rick's gets their stuff from.  I know they claim it's fresh, but I'm the type of consumer that wants to know where my food is coming from.\n\nI'm undecided if I would come back or bring friends here.  With all of the terrific options in Indianapolis, a view simply does not trump over flavor.",

  "text": "I had hoped to walk here from my hotel - a nice 2 mile stroll.  Exercise, sightseeing, and art; perfect right?  Except for the rain that foiled my one woman parade.  Instead I got a quick cab ride with a blink and you'll miss it view of the Rocky steps (you know I was going to run up them and do big champion arms at the top, right?), some streaks of green lawn, and a few fearing for my life \"Philly drivers are insane\" moments.\nThe museum was well worth it.  The lobby reminded me of the one at the Met, while the museum itself could've easily been one of the dozens I visited in Europe.\nI agree with Heather wholeheartedly on her advice for the special exhibits - although I'll warn that weekdays are no better.  The exhibits should really be limited to  a certain number of people at a time rather than a flow, and I think if they changed the way they sold tickets they could manage that.  Say, only 30 people can buy tickets for the 1pm slot, and they have, oh 20 - 30 minutes to go through, and then the next group can go at 1:30 and so on. . . . life would be grand.  Shoving past people once you'd like to move on while they look at you like you're the rudest thing they've ever seen (as they shove back to try to take the space your body left open before someone else can) is not my idea of fun.  I love Frida's work and it is so detailed sometimes that I really want to get up close.  Plus, I'm not a huge fan of crowds.  That said, the exhibit was great, and I even bought a bunch of souvenirs at the end which I don't typically do. \nThe rest of the museum was lovely, although I only had about 15 minutes to kill before it was my turn to line up for the special exhibit so I didn't get to see as much as I would've liked.  \n** aside - Thanks to David for noticing (as always) that this is review #500.  Thanks to the museum and its kick ass Frida exhibit for making such a happy review memory.  I'd also like to thank my mom and dad, without whom none of this would've been possible.  Thank you to my . . . * music swells and drowns out typing . . *",

  "text": "This place is a find and a steal.\n\nWho knew that there is a fully functioning restaurant in HCC's Dale Mabry Campus? Only tell your really good friends, because seating is limited and I want to always be able to get a table.\n\nThere are very narrow windows when this \"restaurant\" is open. It makes sense, because these are students getting experience, not workers making a living. Look on their website for the hours. We went on a Thursday and it was open from 7 - 8 p.m. That meant that by 8 p.m. everyone was done and getting out of there (though that could be because we were all there at 7 p.m. On the website it says they seat people at 7:45 p.m.) I thought this might end up feeling rushed, but since it is a set menu, food is out quickly so you don't feel rushed at all!\n\nYou can go to their website to see past menus and upcoming ones (for the upcoming dishes, they usually only post the next one). All their menus are themed by country. We were there for Moroccan night. This included Moroccan Farro & Lentil Soup and Feggous & Watermelon salad with Pistachio, Chicken Tagine served over Moroccan Couscous, and Milk Bastilla. Obviously, I just looked at the menu because there is no way I would have remembered all that. The highlights for me included the watermelon salad, which was wonderfully sprinkled with feta. I also enjoyed the Milk Bastilla. It wasn't overly sweet. There are no substitutions so make sure if you have allergies you check the menu ahead of time.\n\nOur waitress was a hoot and a holler. She was super friendly and if she wasn't going to be a chef (which I'm just assuming based on what she is studying), I would suggest she choose a job where she interacts with people on a regular basis.\n\nYou get all of this for only $7! That is insane to me. Bring a $10 bill (they only accept cash or check), leave the change as tip, because honestly, you know it is worth it, and pat yourself on the back for finding this place. You won't regret it.",

  "text": "Soy & Pepper is the latest Korean place to open, although this was a few months ago. Right along trendy Jasper Avenue, I'm pretty curious to see how they will fare with the likes of Joey's, Earls and Cactus Club Cafe chains surrounding them.\n\nThe inside is warm and inviting with clean, modern white walls and comfy seats. Loving the Casa and Soju bottles lined up atop their bar/kitchen.\n\nThe menu is small but I like the logo and play with the salt & pepper shakes. Clever. Lunch specials (11:00am to 2:00pm daily) seem to be the best way to go at S&P. Not sure why but their menu seems overpriced to me.\n\nInteresting that they charge you for banchan if it's not part of one of the dishes you ordered. Can't say I've seen that on a Korean menu before. Dessert! Ooo, another place in town that does pot-bingsoo. And hoddeok is one of my favourite Korean snacks! Must try it next time.\n\n- Banchan - beans was one banchan. The other was kimchi. Stingy portions kind of defeats the purpose of banchan.\n\n- Kabocha squash jeon ($12.00) - shredded kabocha squash, onions, green onions, soy sauce and vinegar dipping sauce. Lightly pan fried, nicely crisp, can't say I've ever had kabocha before. A nice change up from the typical seafood pancake but we wanted more kabocha-like flavour.\n\n- Bulgogi ($16.00) - thin slices of marinated beef, green onions, onions and cabbage. Tasty, well marinated bulgogi. The sauce was excellent. Perfect to soak up in your rice. Only issue we had with this dish was that the small portion size, given the $16.00 price point.\n\n- Roasted bossam ($22.00) - slow roasted marinated pork belly and pork shoulder, ssamjang (gochujang and doenjang) sauce with daikon wraps. Both cuts of meat were tender but the daikon wraps just weren't doing it for me. The traditional method with lettuce wraps is much more satisfying. The dish was beautifully presented but that seriously affected the quantity of meat that you get. $22.00 for that much? You've got to be kidding me.\n\nIt's nice that there's finally a spot downtown to get Korean food if you don't feel like heading all the way to the south side. That being said, you're paying for the prime location and portions are not what you would call sharing size. We shared all three dishes and was nowhere near being full. Probably not my first choice when I think of Korean but the food was better than I expected.",

  "text": "I'm not a bar person.  Even casually, I don't remember the last time I was in a bar.\n\nI was doing some business with Roberts Camera across the street and was looking around the downtown area, taking some photos, and thought about getting a snack to hold me until I could stop for a real meal.\n\nI had returned from Monument Circle and Circle City Mall, etc. and remembered something about Union Station being a big deal.  Forgive me, but I was out of state for 22 years.  Things change, right?  I walked past many doors that seemed to be forever closed.  At the end, the door worked and I entered.\n\nI didn't see much but a large restaurant/bar.  I talked to the person out front of the place.  He told me that everything else had closed a long, long time ago.  He also told me that they had appetizers for half price, $1.00 beer, and they were not busy.  It seemed perfect.  (Not that I like beer, but everyone made it out like I should be happy, so I smiled.)\n\nJason brought me a menu, introduced himself, and as I looked over the appetizers, I ordered an iced tea and the mini fish tacos.  I was in the San Fran Bay Area in August and didn't get fish tacos but every other kind.  I was in Philly/New Jersey in June and got some fish tacos that made me sick so I was interested to see what this restaurant had.\n\nThe iced tea wasn't bad--typical of what you get in most of the states.  It could have been from Kroger or Marsh.\n\nWhen the fish tacos arrived, I was psyched.  If you haven't tried Rubio's in Southern California or Beto's in Orlando, Florida, you don't know what you're missing.  They may not even be the best.  The fish tacos here were really good.  They didn't seem to have the mayonnaise/chipotle sauce that some places have but they had a cup of red salsa on the side.\n\nNow, if I was paying full price, I might be more critical, and with the tip, it ended up being priced like a meal at a cheap chain restaurant but it really was good and I would certainly return.",

I had to try the Pho because of a number of other people recommended it on Yelp.\n\nBanh Xeo was an 8 on my wifes scale.  It was a little less \"homemade\" taste but was still very good and crispy.  Additionally it didn't have what she expected in pork inside.  It had the BBQ pork instead.  But still very good.  My daughter had the Sweet and Sour pork.  It was ok.. a little overdone.  My son devoured his Orange Chicken.  The sauce was good.  But if you go to a Vietnamese place for Chinese.  You really shouldn't complain about it not being perfect.  My rare beef pho was good.  But it was lacking in flavor a bit.  Sure I still hit it with the pre-requisite fish sauce, hoi-sin, rooster sauces.  But the broth was just a little light for my tastes.  Also they have GREAT Cha Gio (vietnamese egg rolls).

We walked in and the place was really quiet, with a couple of people.  We sat at the bar, and started to look over the menu, but couldn't find any of their beers on the list.  And when we looked at the taps, they all were all beers from different breweries.  When I asked the bartender what Jackson Brewery beers were on tap, he said that the Brewery stopped making beers years ago and it no longer exists, only the building is left for other businesses.  Instead, they serve local craft beers from all around Louisiana.  Having never had beer from Louisiana I did a flight, which came with four samples.  I tried the three IPAs that were available and a coffee porter.  Unfortunately, all of the IPAs were really weak and not that hoppy, which was disappointing since IPA is my favorite kind of beer.  When I asked the bartender about what are some popular IPAs from the state are, he told me that not a lot of people like IPAs; but more breweries are starting up around the area, and they always carry an IPA just to have one.  Okay... Maybe I am too Pacific Northwest, but it was still disappointing to learn of the beer scene in Louisiana.  The bartender was friendly though hence the two stars.",

Sticky floors, and hard to clean when they rush people in and out of the theater.\n\nRecently someone was shot here (someone complained at someone else for being noisy, ironically, during a movie).",

  "text": "As a coffee shop, it's not terribly warm and cozy.  But there are lots of tables, which is a good thing in a college neighborhood.  I've always been able to find a place to sit.  (I do agree, though, that coffee shops shouldn't be study hall.  Coffeehouse owners are trying to make money, and you don't have a right to sit for hours, use their electricity to run your laptop, and create a trip hazard with your cords because you bought one cup of coffee.)\n\nThe coffee is not bad.  I don't go out of my way for it, but it's a nice alternative to Starbucks.  Green Line is a better option just up the road, but if you are in a hurry and need caffeine this will do.  The pastries weren't very good.",

  "text": "Who would have thought that one of the best tasting meals I've ever gotten from Santa Barbara would be from this local deli? With so many positive reviews, Pickles & Swiss had to be one heck of a meal - and it was! \n\nPickles & Swiss is pretty tiny. There are a few tables and chairs located outside the restaurant, and a big communal table and some window seating inside. Order at the front and they'll hand you your order when it's ready. They have a good number of sandwiches on their menu - from paninis, to P & S Favorites, to cold and hot sandwiches, whatever you crave, they probably have it! They also have soups, sides, salads, and wraps. We ended up ordering a tuna melt sandwich and a roasted chicken and walnut pesto panini with a side of chicken orzo soup. \n\nTuna Melt: $9.95 My sister said this was the best tuna melt she'd ever had in her life. It was that good. The sandwich came with cheddar, tomato, bell peppers, and mayonnaise on wheat bread. Even though the sandwich sounded quite simple, the taste was powerful and super satisfying. If you're a fan of tuna, you need to try P&S's tuna melt. The side of pickle was the perfect compliment to the sandwich. \n\nRoasted Chicken and Walnut Pesto Panini: A bit pricey at $10.75, but it was worth the money! The sandwich came with housemade roasted chicken, provolone cheese, roasted peppers, and fresh walnut pesto on brioche bread. Amazing right? It really was. My sister, who isn't a fan of trying new things, found herself really enjoying this sandwich. That nutty pesto and juicy chicken had such amazing flavor that worked so well together! And having it in a pressed panini with the pickle - really, really good. I personally would order this sandwich again. \n\nSmall side of chicken orzo soup: $3.95 the soup was really tasty as well! My parents both found themselves really liking the rice in the soup. Flavor was spot on, and there was a good amount of ingredients inside the soup. \n\nAnd that dill pickle popcorn dispenser allows you to get a handful of dill pickle popcorn to try while you're waiting in line. And if you happen to like it that much, you can even buy a bag to take home! \n\nThe workers here were super friendly; I think we even got to talk with the owner himself as he made sure everything was going well and the food was good. \n\ntl;dr - Definitely a must try if you're visiting Santa Barbara and looking for a good place to eat. The sandwiches here are solid (from what we tried). Love the friendly atmosphere - the fact that the restaurant always had a line (and offered complimentary water) was awesome. Will be back to try more when I am in the area!",

Just about the time I start taking for granted the tiny little art on my money, and figuring it was created by some laser machine, I'm introduced to the machines that made it possible in the 19th century.  It finally dawns on me we didn't have those micro machines with laser cutting and yet those tiny little pictures were still extraordinary.  It was a very labor intensive task made obsolete by modern technology.  \n\nThe upper floors of this museum are filled with memorabilia about Preservation Hall.  The small gift shop on the first floor has some souvenirs to remind you of one of those things that makes New Orleans so memorable.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no souvenirs of coins from the NO mint, but there are plenty on display as you walk in the front entrance.\n\nYou'll never look at your money the same way again.

Buckwheat batter is an option for .95 cents additional cost.  \n\nI tried the lemon curb with fresh blueberry crepe....jaw dropping delicious.  Hands down best crepe I've had in the St. Louis Metropolitan area.  The whip cream was hand made; I can tell by the texture this didn't come out of a can.  My dark roast black coffee complimented the sweet (not too sweet) crepe.\n\nFree Wi-Fi, beautiful enclosed patio for window seating and people watching make this place a winner.

  "text": "We were a little reluctant bringing kids to a restaurant on a Friday night, but it worked out well.  We never order off kids menu and just let them eat the same thing as adults.  Pace doesn't have a printed kid's menu, but they can accommodate requests for kids meal.  The kids behaved really well, maybe they were mesmerized by the live cello and guitar performance or maybe because the food was to their liking.  My three year old kept requesting more prime rib and my 1.5 year old was dipping her finger into the sweet chili sauce after she ran out of calamari to dip.  \n\nService was warm without being overly attentive.  Most importantly, the food was delicious.  Calamari fries was crispy on the outside and surprisingly tender on the inside.  The strips of calamari had a good marinate to tenderize the meat before being coated with panko and dunked in hot oil.  The sauce on the side tasted like a thick spicy nuoc mam.  The prime rib was seasoned perfectly and cooked to the right temperature, although the dish was old school and not at all inventive.  Its understandable that a new restaurant in a small city can't afford to push the boundaries like in LA or NYC.  \n\nThe pork tenderloin was perhaps the best dish of the night.  Thick medallions of pork and 3 large shrimps were pan seared and topped with a sweet sake sauce flavored with thin slices of shitake mushrooms and pickled gingers.  The sauce was savory and sweet, but not cloyingly sweet.  This dish fused well executed western technique with eastern flavors.  Both dishes were served with sauteed asparagus tips and mashed skin on potato.  Again, very standard sides, but executed well that the asparagus tips were slightly crisp and the mashed potato was creamy and perfectly seasoned.                       \n\nThe restaurant was about 2/3 full during dinner time on Friday night and started to wind down around 9:30.  Its evident that good words have gotten out, but a restaurant located on State could do much better than this.  Come on people, what are you waiting for?  Give Pace a try and you will not be disappointed.",

I love that in the deli department there are so many delicious, unique and varied options of pre-made salads, etc. The cheese selection is excellent. I love all the super yummy gourmet sauces, crackers, oils, vinegars and other culinary treats that are found up and down the isles. And unlike large grocery stores you can can find everything you are looking for (and more) very quickly and easily because the store is small, filled only with quality foods, no processed, sugar filled U.S. boxed items that are chemically engineered and utterly lacking in nutrients. \n\nSunterra is easily accessible from the Whytmud, with lots of parking and going \"green\" seems to be quite important to them. They also source quite a lot from local farms and ranchers. There is a little cafe in the market so you can pop in and buy something from the deli and have lunch or dinner. The only thing that I find can be somewhat of a problem is that sometimes they have inexperienced people working in the deli. So, you have to be patient and wait.",

  "text": "I stopped by for a tour and a wine tasting on a Saturday.  I was able to grab a parking space in one of the nearby lots and hopped on one of the tours.  The business is a production facility for the wines as well as a showroom, so tours are only conducted on weekends for safety reasons.  The tours are free and only take between 15 and 30 minutes, depending upon the number of questions people ask along the way.  During the tour, you see the machines used from receiving the grapes, through processing and fermentation, to storage and bottling.  It's pretty interesting, but lacks a \"wow\" factor since they aren't running the machines during the tour.\n\nI also tried the \"tasting\" of seven wines for $5.  I had to sign up for the tasting and wait for the appointed time.  Fortunately, since there are three counters running at a time, tastings start every 15 minutes.  I liked that they gave me a checklist that describes the options in each  \"barrel\" (round) and I was able to pick from either of the columns.  The guy behind the counter was friendly and seemed pretty knowledgeable of the wines, giving even more information about each of the choices before serving.  The tasting started off with some dry options and moved through semi-sweets and sweets, ending with the most popular \"Reggae\" line of wines.\n\nIf you are interested in picking up bottles of wine you enjoyed during the tasting, they sell both chilled and at room temperature.  For those not wanting to wait, a patio with umbrellas is just outside the entrance and makes a nice place to enjoy your purchase.  I am not sure about the arrangement for glasses and if any food is available to munch on while sipping.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed most of the wines that I tried during the tasting.  I think for its size, it is a nice business, one of Indiana's oldest wineries.  \n\nReview #268",

That tells you how amazing they are! \n\nStop in for a treat or look for them around town. You will not be sorry you did!",

You go to the back to find a very large outdoor patio with live music (an actual stage). The lightening, the seating and the whole makeup was so appealing to the eyes. I went on a Monday night around 9pm and it was PACKED!

When this occurs, you must resist the urge to turn and run.  Trust the Yelp.\n\nAt 7:15 pm in the dark, I drove right past what appeared to be just another gas station on the corner of nowhere on the outskirts of Tucson.  Where was Papa Loco's - all I saw was a Conoco?  We pulled a U-turn and drove by again.  I still didn't see anything but my wife thought she spotted a sign for Papa's.  We pulled into the parking lot and drove up to a small restaurant taking up about 1/3 of the gas station convenience store.  I was initially concerned that this was not the type of place I was seeking.  Then a soothing voice whispered in my ear, \"Trust the Yelp.\"\n\nYou've already read too many words that have nothing to do with the food, so I'll simply say this - fresh, homemade, authentic, fun, and delicious.  I have no idea if Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives has ever featured this little restaurant, but it's exactly the type of place that warrants that type of recognition.  The prices are right, the salsa bar has a ton of variety, the restaurant is clean, there is a nice patio that wraps around the little restaurant, and after the closing time the kitchen crew sings loudly in Spanish to the radio - not in an annoying way, but in a \"we really enjoy working here and we all like our coworkers\" kind of way.\n\nIf you're driving through Tucson, put this place on your itinerary.  It's definitely on mine when I return.",

We went a bit of a different route --\n\nVeggie Fritters - These were a little bland on our end. Not sure if we just got a weird batch? They did have some visibly delicious veg within, but the flavors were a bit flat. The dipping sauce was interesting, too. A different take on honey mustard. Not my favorite. \n\nVeggie Mu Shu - Where the veggies were pretty good, the crepes, which are typically softer, chewier, and a bit more structured, were pretty bad. They fell apart and had a really bad texture altogether. I forewent them and just ate the veggies, which again, were fantastic. \n\nVeggie Lo Mein - Holy sesame oil, Batman! That's really all I can say. It was so overwhelmingly sesame-laden that it was a bit hard to eat bite after bite. My wife only ate about 1/3 of it. \n\nThe setting of this place is just awesome, though. Killer place for a drink on the patio or even at the bar. I'd definitely recommend the sushi and veggie burger, but the items we had are a little less-than passable. Either way, still a huge fan of PM!",

We tend to order cauliflower if it's offered as an appetizer and we have yet to be disappointed and 47 Scott's was no exceptions. The batter was crispy and the buffalo sauce was light yet flavorful. The bistro steak was cooked precisely as I ordered it and was seasoned perfectly as were the truffle fries. The broccolini was slightly over done for my liking but not a deal breaker. \n\nThe service was swift and our server was polite and inviting. The only recommendation I would make is to tidy up the back patio. Where we sat it, there were stacks of chairs, heating lamps, and a fan that just isn't eye appealing. Even leaving the heating lamps as is by the tables would be more appealing so that they could tidy up that space and add more greenery because the patio area is, for the most part, very nice.",

That former self... is really proud of my current self where each time I need to buy a toy as a gift I've been heading to this place. \n\nToday a random Saturday afternoon I dipped in thinking I'd be out in 5. I was out in 15. It was worth it. I found a safe for 7 year old fake archery set. Yeah, archery. Then I walked the 3 foot box of archery down Mass Ave like a proud champion of the marketplace. And, I kept it under my $20 limit for the gift (sorry $4 gift wrapping I wasn't giving into exceeding my limit). \n\nIf you look close enough... say in the map section... there are things here for adults. \n\nWhen it comes to design, intrigue, assortment, vibe, lay out & flow, I don't know if there's a better store to keep us there just long enough it doesn't bother or beguile us but instead we stay there just long enough we've found *just* the gift in *just* the right store.",

  "text": "Well, I have to admit that this was a two-three star experience. We visited during Dining Out for Life which one expects to be busier than norm but it appeared that Lockerbie Pub opted not to prepare and staff up at all given how few people were working. Then in turn, said staff appeared to be stretched and not the friendliest in their resulting customer service. I was most impressed by the Damien volunteer who was not only hustling to help but offering up the friendliest vibes there.\n\nI was digging the dive bar vibes and love this neighborhood bar's location within the Lockerbie Square and Mass Ave neighborhoods. Be prepared for a hazy hint of cigarette smoke smell from bygone years that is probably etched into the walls. It fits the overall vibe though. \n\nOn the food and drinks front, we ordered an assortment of cocktails and craft beer. I was especially impressed that my ginger and Jameson was only $4.50- two! We ordered a plethora of dive bar eats like breaded tenderloins, patty melt, BLT, mozzarella sticks and a fiesta taco salad. I was really amped up for the fried pickle chips I've heard about but alas, they were out during our visit. Our waitress was gruff and hard to flag down for orders and the check and set the tone for the less than hot experience. I'll probably return one day for pickle chips and a mixed drink but won't be running back.",

Taking a 3 year old to the game means lots of up and down from the seats and I was so thankful for the great waking track that runs around the field and offers great views of the game from wherever you choose to stop. \n\nI was also super thankful for the outfield kids play zone complete with an Archie bounce house, an epic inflatable slide, play structure and pitching game! After a few innings my dude was itching to burn up the dippin dots he downed and this was just what the doctor ordered. \n\nThe games themselves are fun to watch abd there really isn't a bad seat in the house. Big Shout out to Chris Payne the amazing voice of the Aces for several seasons running! His commentary in between play really brings the fun to the game and adds so much!\n\nI'm grateful to live in Reno and have the Aces here as another fun highlight to the summer!",

We went to El Tapatio for a late breakfast/early lunch. I had Huevos a la Mexicana - eggs scrambled with tomatoes, jalapeno, and onion. It came with a side of rice, beans, and guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce. And FOUR tortillas (choice of corn or flour, not made in house). The food was pretty good, but not as good as some other places on Nolensville, so I don't think we'll head to El Tapatio too often. The coffee was instant (yuck), but the service was great. All in all, it was an okay, but not great Mexican spot on Nolensville, but it has so much competition!",

This is where I take my guests who are here for the first time and they want a little taste of nature without dying due to altitude issues. There are hikes galore in this area, from the very simple and accessible mile-long loop (perfect for after dinner exercise) or the more strenuous trails that lead to ridge tops with fantastic views of the valleys and lake. During the summer, come early to avoid crowds. During winter, snow shoes are a fun activity. Very dog friendly. Oh, and let's not forget Chickadee Ridge where if you come with some bird seed, those chirpy little buggers will come and sit on your hand.",

  "text": "Small neighborhood bar with decent food, cheap drinks and new owner and chef. Pool table, juke box and nothing fancy just folks enjoying themselves. All starters, soup, salads and sandwiches are under $10.00. Dinners range from $9.50 - $20.00.\n\nLunch not as rowdy or loud as evening. Bartender was friendly and prompt with our orders. Fried Pickle Chips were great...not greasy and large basket  for $4.50. \n\nNow for one of the Flag favorites. If you're looking for a heart attack on a bun or starving, or just need two meals, try \"The Big Pig Sandwich\" which is pulled pork, on top of smoked ham, on top of Bacon on a bun. BBQ sauce tasty! OH and it  comes with fries. All for $8.00. Takes 3 hands to eat even cut in 1/2.\n\n\"Rajun Cajun Chicken Sandwich\", also a Flag favorite, is huge as well. Spicy blackened chicken breast topped with pepper jack cheese and cajun ranch sauce. LARGE, thick, tender chicken breast. Sandwich with french fries $7.50. I personally prefer withouth the ranch sauce only because it takes 10 paper towels to get through. I enjoy spice and blackend so I prefer just a bit more blackened which they will do if you ask. Either way, still a good sandwich.\n\nFood is good and for those wanting healthier options try one of their salads. BBQ Pork Salad, Southwest Chicken Salad, Chef Salad or Chicken Caesar Salad.\n\nThe only problem I can see, and has always been a problem, is parking. The front (maybe 10 spaces) is for motorcycle parking and only few spaces on both sides of building for vehicles. It is what it is!!! but you can park in local business next door after their business hours.\n\nBe sure to ask what Chef has prepared for the day. Food and drink specials daily. Fish Fry every Friday. Alaskan Walleye w/fries and coleslaw for $6.00 very popular.\n\nCheck the Calendar of Events times for Monday poker, Wednesday karaoke and Friday dart tournament.",

It wasn't and since then it has been the same litany of lousy follow up by TVC management as Karen W reports for her project too.  We are still waiting on some of the work to be completed.  And these guys were not our choice.  New to the area we knew nothing about them and they were part of the custom home build contract as the closet sub contractor used by the general contractor.  \n\n The owner of TVC seems a nice enough guy, actually, and has himself been on site a couple of times always with the excuse that things went south on this project because \"we are just so busy\".  Which makes me scratch my head that anyone would use them now that I know better.   But since Karen W and I both know better, the question is why didn't the builder of this home. And as P.S. here I'll offer up that our experience with the General Contractor, Tradewinds, was chock full of lousy management examples...maybe water seeks its' own level in Tradewinds choosing sub-contractors like Treasure Valley Closets.",

If you do nothing else, make sure you order this. Ask for extra bread to soak up all the extra sauce. It's a small portion but it's 100% worth it. \n\nI also really liked the Lobster Mac & Cheese.

The only upside of this dish was the generous serving size, other than that, the herbage was sparse, just shreds of lettuce and a few specks of cilantro with a huge mound of rice noodles.  The cha gio was ok, but was also tiny.  The pork should have being grilled until the sweet marinade caramelizes and the fat drips onto the fire and perfumes the meat with a light smokiness.  Here, the pork was instead fried ahead of time, so the meat was bland, dry, and shockingly bad.  Perhaps, they have better dishes, but do not get the bun thit nuong or you will regret it.",

Ok, that may be a bit rough, but seriously the pho doesn't compare to what you'd get on Washington Ave. Of course, as they say in the real estate biz, location location location.  \n\nLet's start with location.  Old city has its share of bars, restaurants, and clubs.  However, Pho has been absent from the mix.  If you don't have a car or don't feel like giving up your spot, MTQ would probably do the trick.\n\nNow on value.  The all-in Pho is $10 while other varieties are offered for $9.  However, the bowl size is about the same as a regular pho on Washington Ave ($6-7).  The fixings (bean sprouts, lime, etc) were fresh.  No tripe in the Pho which disappointed me a bit (to be clear, their menu does not list tripe, I'm just used to Pho having tripe).\n\nService was good.  The ability to sit indoor or out was nice.

Duffy's has a whopping 81 TV's for watching all the games and football helmets everywhere including a Gators and Bucs helmet! Duffy's has a 2 for 1 happy hour all day everyday on everything except for shots and jai lai. Duffy's house sauza blue margaritas go for $6, so with the 2 for 1 deal, it's only $3 per margarita! For an additional $3 you can make any of the margaritas into a Corona-rita with the addition of an upside down Corona bottle in your drink with a holder to keep it in place! Calling the menu \"the playback\" is a pretty nice touch for a sports bar that I've nver seen before! Duffy's also serves a deluxe patron margarita and a strawberry margarita with fresh island oasis mix. I got the Korean beef taco trio for the appetizer and the blackened grilled Mahi Mahi w corn and black beans and rice for the entree. Both were quite tasty. The Mahi Mahi came out a little salty but I was still able to eat it without any problems. In my picture the Mahi Mahi dish doesn't look the most appetizing. Something as little as a garnish on the fish or sauce put on in an artistic manner would definitely dress up these dishes since they're trying to be an \"upscale sports bar\". The sides that Duffy's offers were a little disappointing- No macaroni and cheese, no au grautin potatoes, or no asparagus like Grill Smith offers. Terry said their mushroom bacon burger, baby back ribs, and shrimp scampi pasta are also pretty popular at their other locations. On my second visit to Duffy's, I had their full rack of baby back ribs with a loaded baked potato and the ribs were fall-off the bone tender, with the right amount of BBQ, and quite delicious!  The decor of Duffy's is upscale with dark woods, 81 TV's, football helmets, and sports memorabilia all over the walls. They have a frequent visitor program so for every $100 you spend you get $10 off and you get a Free appetizer for signing up for emails so you know I signed up! We sat at the bar and got too meet bartenders Terry, Lexi, and Desiree and they were really nice and cool. Service couldn't have been better. I rarely give out 5 stars so really there's no knocks against this place at this point. I could go to a 5 star after another couple visits maybe. Highly recommend! Duffy's is located right off S Dale Mabry next to the interstate exit in the big shopping plaza with the Target, Rooms to Go, DSW shoe warehouse, Alfred Angelo Bridal, Total Wine, Whole Foods, PetSmart, Home Depot, Nordstrom Rack, and HomeGoods. There is a large parking lot on site with plenty of parking available. Sometimes it can take over 20 minutes to get out of this Plaza. It would be awesome if this Plaza could get another exit. I Look forward to coming back again soon to try their ribs!",

Now, I totally get it. The pizza at Pizzeoli, it truly top notch and worthy of a spot on my Yelp List - Pizza with Pizzazz. \n\nWhen it was announced that the April gathering of ISC (International Supper Club) was going to meet at Pizzeoli, I rolled my eyes. I love my group of ISC diners, so I put my diet aside and my distaste for vegetarian pizza. Besides, Ian had them on his STL 100 and said i \"must order\" the Bianca. \n\nMy Bianca was a wonderful choice. It has no tomato sauce, instead it is Béchamel Sauce with extra virgin olive oil, fresh mozzarella, garlic, rosemary and parmesan. With it being wood fired it had the perfect amount of char on the outer crust. I never knew a pizza without meat could taste so good. \n\nThe surprise and most popular pizza of the night was the nightly special - Brussel Sprouts. We all wanted to try it, but were hesitant to try it as our only pizza. So Sarah S. treated us all to one & we got to experience a slice. Once I tried it - I wish I had ordered one entire pizza for myself. It too was, Béchamel Sauce, mozzarella, garlic and then roasted brussel sprouts on top. It was pure heaven! As we were leaving we told the owner - he had to add it to the regular menu. If it's on the menu when you visit, order it - I guarantee you'll love it. \n\nOur server, Kevin was a real trooper. Taking care of 9 diners all with separate checks is no easy task and he did it like a champion. \n\nI'll be back, hopefully for another Brussel Sprouts pizza. \n\nWhen: April 14, 2016\nWhy: International Supper Club",

To our delight, the place was pretty empty and only a few tables were seated. We were lead to a table in the back and given menus. We ordered our drinks and our appetizers and both came out fairly quickly. I ordered a cup of the crab bisque and I really enjoyed it. After finishing the soup we were ready to order entrees, and the waitress was no where to be found. Actually, she was on the other side of the room helping everyone but us.\n\nLet me be clear here: I don't blame the waitress for being slow to take our order. I think the blame here lies in the kitchen. I am more than positive that the kitchen told the waitress to only send back one or two orders at a time. After waiting a while, the waitress came back over, apologized for the wait and took our order.\n\nI was really in the mood for a cheeseburger and fries, so that's what I got. The burger was HUGE, thick and cooked perfectly. It's not the best burger I've had in my life, but it was good and I had leftovers, so I was happy. \n\nThe yummy burger and the nice waitress are why I rounded up on the star rating. Maybe it was just a bad night and they were understaffed. Everyone I encountered was super sweet and helpful. The restaurant itself is very nice and makes for a perfect date spot.",

When the clerk said that our meal number was 71, the counter girl announced, \"Number 40!\" And, unfortunately, they moved in order. Slowly. Around the counter, a herd of hungry humans hovered, staring her down (myself included, admittedly). I respect her for not melting down under the pressure. I probably would! Drinks and silverware are also self-serve.\n\nAfter nearly an hour of waiting at the counter, standing, shuffling, etc., my number was finally called. The food was really good, and I really enjoyed BBQ sauce number 5, but the chicken was a tad cold, which was confusing to me. Still, the flavor redeemed it.\n\nThe meal also came with chips, a side salad and a dinner roll. Good deal! I also bought a brownie, mainly because, really, who can pass up on a brownie when it's sitting right in front of you as you pay?\n\nWhole Hog has an interesting, communal concept, and is vastly different from most places you'll find in the Cherry Hill area. The diverse clientele proved as much. Still, unless I'm in absolutely no rush at all and am not dying of hunger, I would probably order take out from this place in the future! Mainly since I lack patience and what-not.",

A friend decided we should head here after some Cinco de Mayo margaritas and I was excited to check it out. \n\nSo I guess it is really a biker bar of sorts. When you walk in head straight across to the bar and grab a seat. Or maybe you prefer a table - grab one of those. Got some dollar bills? Hit up the jukebox and play your jams. Out back there's also a patio so I hear. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. Ladies bathroom had shower curtains for doors but they were pink and had fun girly patterns so that's fun.\n\nClientele were all over the board. Some bikers and just regular people like us too. The bartender lady was the best! Friendly, chatty, and fun. Plus she informed me that there's karaoke every other Friday. Oh how I love a dive with karaoke! \n\nI loved it too much I had way more than just one beer and may have stayed out way past my bedtime but it. Was. Totally. WORTH. IT. I will be back!!",

  "text": "The Hyatt Regency at the Arch is a standard Hyatt.  Hyatt is my favorite hotel chain, though I can rarely afford to stay at them.  This hotel was no different.  The beds were very comfortable, the pillows were nice.  The shower was fine, and the room was a fine size for a city.  I was disappointed to overlook the city and not the Arch like my colleagues, but we cannot win everything.  The front desk texted me when my room was ready early, and the bag check people were lovely and easy.  The fruit water as you walked in the door was always delicious.  If I had just stayed in the hotel, it would have been an easy 5 stars.\n\nThe conference spaces were nice but freezing beyond the point of acceptable.  Everyone I talked to was complaining about the cold temperature.  It happened to be a cool summer week in St Louis (High in the 70s and low 80s), and it was air-conditioned like it was 100 degrees outside.  It was miserable.  This wasn't a deal-breaker, but it was not five star quality.\n\nThe Brewhouse Restaurant was convenient and very reasonably priced so I did spend a good amount of time here.  I was shocked by the massive portion of the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla ($10), and it easily lasted two meals.  The service was painfully slow and poor, but the food I ordered and tried was good.\n\nMy largest objection with this hotel is that the Brewhouse bar over-served a man pretty severely.  I was having a drink with a friend around midnight, and a very drunk and large man came up and stood directly next to me in a creepy way.  The bartender noticed but kept trying to look away.  The man eventually tried to pick up three drinks off of the bar, tripped, and sent them everywhere.  One ended up on me, one across the whole side of the bar, and another broke on a chair and all over the floor.  It was a mess, and every server and bartender kept walking past it and did not ask the man to leave or even clean up.  It was completely absurd.  The other hotel staff was great, but this was just unimpressive.\n\nI'd come back to this hotel, but I would not pay top dollar after seeing that bar incident.",

  "text": "I was looking for a place to watch the Super Bowl so I headed out a few days prior for my own personal \"pub crawl\" that included 8 or so bars along State Street.  Sandbar was highly recommended as my criteria was that they needed plenty of TV's, Coors Light and the ability to sit outside.\n\nWell, two out of three isn't too bad, I guess!  First of all, no Coors Light (I learned it is hard to come by in this town).  Secondly, while there is outside seating (I would like to go back when I am only looking to eat and drink and not watch TV) there is no way to watch the TV's from the outdoor seating.  So if it is a game you want to watch- you will be indoors.  But once inside- there are plenty of places to catch your favorite game!\n\nAt the bar- the clientele is a little collegiate for my taste, but the bartender was friendly and a couple of the locals took pity on me and gave me a better list of places to check out, than that which I had gotten from my hotel.\n\nAnd know that if you stay later into the evening- Sandbar becomes the place to \"see and be seen\" as it transitions from a bar/restaurant to Santa Barbara's version of a nightclub.  What was a causal place earlier in the night draws an interesting crowd as the shadows lengthen.\n\nService was spot on and any place I can sit outside in February gets at least a couple of  more stars from me.  My advice?  If you go . . . .go early (at least if you are older than 25!)",

  "text": "We were staying at the Ace Hotel just a couple of minutes down the street and were starving past midnight on a Friday. We thought Seaworthy looked like a nice little spot to duck in, though it was obviously a cocktail bar and we weren't sure if they were still serving food. Lucky for us, they had a late night food menu available from 11pm-1am.\n\nWe actually didn't order any drinks, and instead got a half a dozen raw oysters and split the burger. The oysters were very fresh from the east, west, and gulf coasts, and average about $3 each, which I found to be higher than what's typically charged at home. The burger was 8oz of half brisket, half beef chuck, which I asked for mid-rare. It was cooked perfectly and had fontal cheese, roasted ham, and garlic aioli in a brioche bun, with a side of seaweed seasoned fries and spicy pickles. It was absolutely delicious, and the fries were crispy, well-seasoned, and actually ended up being a larger portion than we thought. We asked for some garlic aioli on the side for dipping for fries, and it made our meal all the more droolworthy.\n\nUnexpectedly fantastic meal, friendly service, vibe is trendy, and extra points for the late-night mood lighting.",

Other than highlights and a haircut every 7-8 weeks I do not  indulge in any salon services so it was such a treat to have my hair washed and styled by someone else. I love that Bubbles & Blowouts offers a childcare area if I cannot get my husband to watch our toddlers.\n\nAfter an exhausting Thanksgiving I decided that I could use a little pampering and treated myself to a blowout before our family Christmas pictures. I had heard great things about Bubbles & Blowouts from the Moms of South Tampa so I checked out the website and to see their hours and discovered I could book an appointment online. I really liked that I could book an appointment online instead of calling because I rarely get a minute to pick up the phone with my clingy one year old. Not only was I able to book my reservation quickly and quietly after I put my toddlers to bed, but I was also able to score a morning appointment before nap time!\n\nThe location on South Dale Mabry is super convenient to my house and there was plenty of parking spots available. Loved the fun and modern decor and music. Did I mention the awesome childcare area?! The owner obviously gets that busy moms want to get pampered, but do not always have access to a babysitter. My stylist Dali was so sweet and friendly and did an amazing job with my hair! I decided to pay a little extra and added beach waves to my blowout. The result was so pretty and she added enough hairspray so that my hair still looked fabulous five hours later at our photoshoot!",

My two favorite things are biking and eating and the culinary tour combined both of those loves into one beautiful afternoon. \n\nI would highly recommend to do this on your 1st full day in NOLA. We signed up ahead of time easily by email. The tour met at 1230 and it was an easy walk from the french q.  The afternoon was a little overcast and chilly but our tour guide  Victor was great about seeing where the storm was heading and we barely got sprinkled on in the 4 hr trip. \n\nVictor was a great guide and a NOLA native. He started the tour talking about himself and credentials and he really knew his NOLA food history. It was very enlightening. Some other tour guides may approach food history in an irreverent way, but not Victor!\n\nThe tour changes every time and we ate a ton of good food amongst 4 spots. All food was shared amongst the group we had 6 total. We ate : plantains with yummy red sauce , ginger spiced spinach, fried oysters in a blue cheese sauce, fried green tomatoes,  praline crusted bacon, Boudin, Boudin balls, cheese curds, cracklins, king cake and bourbon bread pudding!  I'm sure I forgot something but all the bites we had were amazing.\n\nBiking gave us a great perspective of the city and naturally you can cover more ground. Also you feel a bit better about stuffing your face but as their motto says \"it's not even close to exercise\".\n\nThanks CoC and Victor for a great afternoon! When in nola I will be back to try out another tour.",

  "text": "Thai in name and while serving Thai food options in the main, this is one of the many Treasure Valley Thai restaurants that also squeeze Chinese and Vietnamese items onto their menu.  Service is friendly and sometimes, as in our most recent visit, even splendidly so but better organized at some times than others.  Knowing that going in to set patience expectations in advance may make the dining experience more enjoyable.\n\nOwners are the same who own Pad Thai House in Boise and while we have had really poor experience for food and service and facility there, we have had good ones here for the same.  During the 2014 - 2015 years we ate here scores of times but it fell off our radar after that until recently given the discovery of better Thai food elsewhere in the Boise area.  I note the review I posted back then is missing, although the photos posted with it survive.  Having recently reacquainted ourselves with Thai Basil, it seemed worthwhile to review it again.  Falling between 3 and 4 stars based on umpteen visits were it not for the fact they denied access to the bathroom for two women in our recent dining party, we might have rounded up. \n \nVIBE:   Located in one of Meridian's woeful strip malls, the interior is welcoming with Asian décor, including a fish tank at the door, faux bamboo plant accents, dark red walls and interesting lights.  There are comfy seating options at all standard height tables with chairs.  And here I add \"yahoo\" while noting 70% of Zagat surveyed diners said in the 2018 released summary that they were \"so over\" high stool seating and yet so many Treasure Valley eateries rely on them.  Hooray too that there is for the most part ample space between tables to not feel as if one is in a sardine can, as is the case in many other local eateries.  And we appreciate every time we've dined here, even at full house, noise is contained at a level that makes conversation possible.\n\nMENU & FOOD: This is a pretty safe bet for anyone across ages and experience with Asian food, from people whose frame of reference is Americanized Chinese food Sweet and Sour dishes or egg rolls...they have 'em...to people who want a bowl of spicy Thai Green Curry or the stand by dishes like Pad Thai.  There are better options in Boise for Thai food (Thai Cuisine as the leader and Siam Orchid as worthy contender) but this will do for good eats if you know what to order. We like to stay in the Thai lane, but also appreciate the Chinese lacquered duck served here.  Hard to find that cut up with bones in it delight.  Nearly all their Thai dishes are things we'd happily order again.\n\nThere are specials at lunch time, if that's your thing, for under $9 or you can order off of the standard menu then too.  Menu prices run about $6 to $20ish.\n\nSERVICE:  Our most recent visit included people across three generations, some of whom knew nothing about Thai food and little about Chinese food.  The server was a model of grace for explanation and assistance.  Well done.  At peak times, like lunch hour rush, the only couple of cooks in the relatively small kitchen can lag behind and being prepared for delays then is a good idea.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  It is more than disappointing, it is actually illegal, that they have put barriers in the way of equal access to the women's loo by people who use wheelchairs and walkers.  The ADA has been law since 1990 and this restaurant launched around 2014.  They should know better.  They need to remove the chairs stored in the hall outside the ladies' loo door that make the entry too narrow and also remove the piece of changing table furniture in the loo itself.  It is not optional to provide equal access to bathrooms for all people.  It is Civil Rights law. This is the business owner's failure.  The structure of the building is right.  Impediments  added by the restaurant owner are in the way.\n\nPARKING:  Private lot parking is a big advantage here.  But the ADA parking is not laid out for either design nor for the minimum numbers required by both law and Idaho building code.  This is the strip mall owner's failure not the restaurant owner's.\n\nHOURS:  Open Lunch and Dinner but NOT straight through.  Note they are closed from 3:00 - 5:00.  This seems pretty common practice for smaller, owner operated ethnic restaurants as it gives time for \"family meal\"' and for the kitchen to refresh for dinner service.",

After a couple years of bliss with the four cheese pizza, Treno up and decided that the recipe wasn't working. Not only for the four cheese (which they re-branded), but for several other pizzas. They changed the menu entirely and, for that matter, increased prices. The margarita pizza went up in price as well and became greasier and lost flavor. Pizzas are now separated as \"brick fired\" and \"wood fired.\"\n\nBut... to go back to the new quatro fromage pizza -- up in price by $2 to compensate for the new dough-style. The cheese on it? It's bland. It used to have this beautiful, distinctive flavor that brought me back again and again. It was to the point that I couldn't wait for the leftovers because I knew that the flavor would still hold. Now it's all just boring and plain and nothing to write home about. I don't know what happened or why, but it's a huge bummer and it makes me extremely sad. \n\nI raved about this place for so long and loved introducing friends to this spot.

  "text": "I have no idea how it took me so long to get to Felix's. I stopped by for lunch not knowing what to expect, and walked out with a huge smile on my face. This place is so ridiculously cozy and comfortable, and while I'm sure it's a blast at night, I'm going to keep it on my list of places to eat lunch. Before I go any further, I didn't try the pizza. Please do not throw rocks at this review while you're reading it...\n\nI called to see if they were open for lunch (had to correct the hours on Yelp!) and the guy who answered the phone was SO nice and told me to come right in for \"amazing pizza, wings, and more.\" Sweet! We grabbed a cute little spot in the front room that was stationed right in front of the TVs so we could watch the Cardinals game. There was hardly anyone in there and it just felt so casual and relaxing. Their coffee machine was broken which made me a little sad, but I was alright with my water with lemon. We ordered the hummus and vegetables and the veggie grinder for lunch... The hummus came out and the only vegetables there were green peppers and tomatoes, and on the menu it listed broccoli, celery, and more, so that was kind of a bummer. The veggie grinder was SO good! It was spicy and full of cheese and veggies, and was served with Billy Goat chips. \n\nAfter our lunch was over I was tempted to go get my computer out of the car and work at the table with a glass of wine (they have free wi-fi!) but I decided that wine during a workday wasn't the best idea I've ever had. I seriously could've sat there all day though. They have Golden Tee & Big Buck Hunter for those of you who like games, and I seriously can't wait to go back for a relaxing night out and some New York Style pizza!",

Personally, I'm just not a frequent ice cream eater. This location has a good selection of seasonal ice creams (and some of Jeni's staples that stick around year-round), but it's in the Nashville Farmer's Market, which means it's tight. The line kind of wraps and you block people trying to get to other food stands. But it was HOT last weekend, and I was showing some friends around Nashville; we were in the Farmer's Market and I NEEDED something cold. Jeni's frose sorbet hit the spot.",

In particular, they offer Magic Hat #9 which I thoroughly enjoy.\n\nThe bar is extensively decorated with Elvis memorabilia. I found it very hard to not think about the King, or plan a new trip to Graceland while sitting around drinking. For anyone who has not plotted a road trip while sitting in a bar, you're missing out.\n\nThe bar was really dark. In fact, it may have been too dark especially when you consider that I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read something on the bar. Despite the lack of light, I did really like the bar. \n\nI hope to come back soon and drink some more Magic Hat in absolute darkness.",

I enjoyed it so much that it was just a couple weeks after my first visit that I found myself back for another sushi dinner!\n\nThe restaurant is very open, clean and spacious. The floor to ceiling windows bring in so much light. I've been seated at tables right near the windows during both of my visits but I can't imagine any table not having that same bright light. \n\nI've tried a few of their speciality rolls so far and all of them have been delicious. Although every roll I ordered was made with rice, I really appreciated that the seafood was definitely the main component rather than the rice. I hate when restaurants go heavy on the rice. In my opinion, the fish should always be the stand out in the roll!\n\nService was great when I was there and the servers were quiet, but friendly. Prices are reasonable considering the portion sizes and the amount of fish that goes into the rolls. I'm also a huge fan of the presentation!\n\nHappy to make Kumo my sushi restaurant of choice when in Collegeville. I'll be rollin' in frequently with my bottle of wine -- did I mention it's BYO?! :)",

I ordered the beef and meatball pho and it was a great amount of meat to noodle ratio. It was super tasty. \n\nI also ordered the bbq Pork banh mi. It had tons of flavor with it and the bread was a nice texture, not too hard and still nicely toasted.\n\nLastly, I ordered the Vietnamese wings with fries. The flavor is good for the wings and the fries were okay, they are the skinny ones. That was my husband's order.\n\nWhen I ordered it online I received an update through text of when it would be finished and I drove across the street to get it. So super simple and convenient. \n\nI'm super happy to have their leftovers tomorrow!! So so good.\n\nThanks for coming out to the area! So nice not to go far and leave the neighborhood!",

  "text": "In search for a quick coffee while picking up items on Magazine street, I finally had the opportunity to come by the younger sibling of District Donuts Sliders Brew. \n\nA little bigger than a food truck with only outdoor seating; this is a great spot for a grab 'n' go coffee and bite to eat. The interior was nice and toasty while I waited, and has cute references to pi (as in 3.14). I grabbed my usual, a mocha, and their Kung Pao Chicken hand pie. The jury is still out if I think the hand pie was worth $5, but it is damn delicious in my opinion. Hand pies start with the breading, and they're nailing it. Perfectly flaky, warm, and not stale in the least bit. I like the kick to the chicken, and they give you a little side of cabbage/green onion to enjoy with it. I only needed a bite, and this was great to hold me over for the day when I usually eat a bagel. \n\nTheir mocha...I had to go back to make sure it wasn't a fluke. I really really enjoy their mochas. Like dangerously so. They're not syrupy in the least bit. I think they make them with chocolate milk, but not the heavy whole milk kind, but like a perfectly blended chocolate milk. It wasn't overly sweet, and I could still taste hints of the espresso. I may be hooked because I know I'm going back today for another one. \n\nThe seating outside is cute, but more intimate so I wouldn't necessarily meet here for an interview or meeting with someone you wouldn't know. They also have a really cute dog watering hole as well. \n\nDon't think I'm crazy, District Hand Pies, I'm coming back in today for the third day in a row...",

  "text": "Many folx don't know this, by St. Louis has the second largest Mardi Gras celebration in the United States. New Orleans obviously takes the king cake for the number one celebration, and after touring Mardi Gras World, it's clear why this city has the best parades! \n\nMardi Gras World is a truly unique experience in New Orleans that I cannot suggest enough. Located in the Warehouse District, you get the opportunity to get a taste of the Mardi Gras season no matter when you're visiting the Big Easy. Mardi Gras World was created as a tourist attraction to provide visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the work of Blaine Kern, one of the most popular float studios in the city. The experience of Mardi Gras World is top notch! You begin your tour with an informative video about the history of Mardi Gras and also the history of Blaine Kern. It gives a great starting point to understand what you're going to see inside their workshop. (Side note, you also get a slice of king cake to nibble on while you're watching the movie. While you may feel weird taking it... DO IT BECAUSE IT'S TASTY!)\n\nOnce the movie is over you get to take a self guided tour through the facility. I cannot tell you how cool it was! There were artists stations where you could watch floats being sculpted and painted. It was amazing to watch these skilled craftspeople create beautiful pieces that will adorn floats in future Mardi Gras parades. The warehouse is also home to old elements of Mardi Gras floats that can be repurposed on new floats. My boyfriend and I loved being able to snap selfies with the outrageous pieces throughout the tour. They had everything from Disney characters to creepy creatures to Egyptian gods and goddesses. If you could dream it up, they probably had it sitting there. Initially I thought we would be done with the experience very quickly but because there was just so much to view, we spent about 45 minutes looking through Mardi Gras World. \n\nOther things to note about the Mardi Gras World experience... Firstly, they have a free shuttle to the venue! This was a really nice perk as we were staying in the Central Business District and walking would have taken a pretty long time. The process of booking the shuttle was a little confusing as you had to call Mardi Gras World and identify the nearest shuttle stop to your location. We waited about 15 minutes for the shuttle to get to us. The other thing of note is the warehouse is hot and humid (depending on the time of year you visit I suppose.) I was slightly uncomfortable at times because I was slightly overheated. But you're in a warehouse. If you go into the experience knowing it's going to be warm, you won't be upset!",

Both are made with a cream sauce and the pasta is incredibly tender and the toppings ratio just right.  The speck was flavorful and crispy and perfectly balanced by a sprinkling of fresh peas.  The crab linguine was solid but the cream-based pastas were definitely the highlights.  The bread presentation with an individual plating of EVOO, pepper, and Parmesan was also great - plus the panne was incredibly soft and fresh with a flavorful crust.  Of course, the desserts were amazing.  Try the banana bread pudding with fior de latte gelato - the pudding is tender with a crispy crust and a great combination with the creamy gelato.  Service was fantastic and among the best in Phila.  Definitely a must-visit!",

Yes, we have our share of malls in Southern California.  But, none of them can compare to the size of the WEM.  At 3.8 million sq ft, the WEM mall easily beats South Coast Plaza and their measly 2.7 million square feet.  \n\nYou want shopping?  They got it!  They have all sorts of shops from high end retailers to stores like Dollarama.  Restaurants?  They have restaurants from fast food, to sit down fancy restaurants.  You can even be like me and bring your stash from Dollarama into the Halley's Club without getting a snarky attitude from the staff.  You need entertainment?  This mall has an ice skating rink, a replica of the ship, the Santa Maria, an amusement park, movie theaters and a water park.  If you need something more adult, they have a casino and casino related restaurants for you.  Let's not forget your Asian groceries from T&T Market. It's Dynomite!  My parents and in-laws definitely would stop at T&T, but, you would never find me in there as long as I am on vacation. They even have the Fantasyland Hotel here if you don't want to drive back home or to your hotel. \n\nEdmonton people are so nice!  My daughter left her brand new iPhone in the bathroom stall of the Hudson Bay Department Store.  What was she doing with the phone in the stall, I don't know.  But someone found the phone and gave it to lost and found.  If she left the phone in a bathroom stall in California, the phone would never be returned.  \n\nIt's ginormous, and is larger than any other mall I've been to.  Even though we went there twice, I know there are places that we missed.  Why do I have to go shopping while on vacation?",

  "text": "I feel like I have to update my review after having gone through a one-month intro membership with the Hot Room.\n\nSimply put: I loved it. The instructors are amazing, which is the reason why I loved it the most. They're personal, there for YOU and your health, and put a smile on my face every time I attended. \n\nOutside of the Hot Room, I usually tend to go to vinyasa yoga as Bikram usually isn't my style. However, I would say that I completely switch my go-to at the Hot Room. The vinyasa is very challenging in my opinion and the sweat dripping from your personal bits into your face is never a good feeling as you're in downward dog. \n\nI LOVED bikram mostly because it's the same thing every time so you're able to 1) see your progress being made and your growth; and 2) you can make it a meditative state. \n\nI went 20 times in my first month (short because it was February) and I loved it. I felt great, but towards the end of my month, I could tell that going that often was not good for my body. I could feel exhaustion at all times of the day and towards the end, I felt that my body needed like 24 hours of solid sleep, so the intro month was a perfect amount for me.\n\nMy reason for the lower stars: the price. It's insanely expensive and not accessible at all to me at my current income/expenses, which is unfortunate. That being said, don't like that deter you from trying it. Buy the intro month and check it out for yourself. I believe that if you sign onto a membership after your first month, you can get the 2nd month for $59 (or $69?) and then the 3rd month for $89 and then it jumps to the normal $99 a month. \n\nAfter the intro month, I could see and feel changes in my body, so I knew it was working. \n\nNotes/tips/comments: \n- take your shoes off before you head back to the locker rooms\n- try out the intro month (or there's currently a Groupon)\n- download the app - it made booking and cancelling classes insanely easy\n- consume electrolytes basically 24/7. Even with that, my body still didn't feel back to its normal self\n- check out their social media pages: they have lots of free community classes throughout the month\n- be ready to do lots and lots (and then some) laundry\n\nOverall, a great experience and I LOVED doing it during February when the winter gets me down the most. But sadly, the price is just not worth it. Maybe for $50 less a month, I'd consider it, but at $99 a month, it's just not feasible.",

There is a lounge area where you can get coffee or food, there is a gym shop in the front, they let you use nice fluffy towels as soon as you walk in, there is a HUGE weight/cardio room, a nice size indoor pool, the women's locker room is posh with lockers made of wood, showering facilities.  It's frigging amazing!  \nIf I had a family I would definitely sign up for this gym because there is so much for the kids to do.  \n\nAs for the zumba class, it was awesome!  We went on a Wednesday night and the instructor was on a platform so it was easy to see her.  Plus there were other instructors in the front on both sides so you could follow them as well.  It was an awesome workout and the people in the class were very nice in helping us pick up the steps for the routine!\n\nHappy Working Out!",

And it's not fake old bacon bits, it's real bacon. I use the complimentary bread and basically eat the entire thing by bread dip instead of with a spoon. \n\nThis La Madeleine is small and parking can be a little bit of a stink, but I don't mind coming here by myself to enjoy lunch. I also do to-go often from here, though the salad isn't a quarter as good as when they make it in the restaurant. \n\nI've considered buying the dressing to take home, but again, I fear it will lose it's Caesar dressing luster if I try to recreate what I love so much. \n\nThe staff is always pretty sweet too, even when I order take out 10 minutes before they close. ;)",

I got the Dynasty Seafood lunch special, which was decent, with a quarter of a lobster tail, 2 jumbo shrimp, and 2 jumbo scallops, along with celery, snow peas, corn, bamboo, water chestnuts, and shitake mushrooms in a light sauce.  The sauce had a bit too much starch in it, though, as some of the vegetables were coated unevenly.  The dry pot style fish fillet was decent although it is no Han Dynasty.  The stir-fried kidneys was also okay, but nothing too special.  Both were only mildly spicy.  Service was just barely passable, as our waiter pretty much scowled the entire time, not just at us, but at everyone.  The other servers appeared to be much more pleasant.  \n\nIt has been well over a year since I have last been here, and it's not the Lai Lai that I remembered.

  "text": "I went to Green Lemon this past Taco Tuesday with a couple of Yelpers and some new friends. I have been here before but I don't think I have ever visited on Taco Tuesday due to the long wait times and hectic environment. Our party of five had a 45 minute wait for a table. While I would have loved to have a drink while waiting, the bar is nearly impossible to access since there is seating there as well. Since it was hot, humid and about to rain out we opted to stand inside near the doorway and dodge the passersby. We were seated at a table for 4 and pulled up a 5th seat from a neighboring table to make it work. \n\nI must give kudos to our server, Dustin, who was working many tables and got our orders completely accurate. He was attentive and friendly despite the chaos of Taco Tuesday. He was also responsible for fulfilling our secret request to give the birthday girl a sweet surprise. It's those little things that go a long way.\n\nFOOD: On Tuesdays, all Street Tacos are $2 all day. The selections have recently been updated, but there are still plenty of choices. Chicken, pork, beef, mahi mahi, tuna, and even cauliflower as a vegetarian option are available. I opted for a Grilled Mahi Mahi and a Kung Fu'd Tuna wrapped in Bibb lettuce instead of a tortilla (you can choose hard or soft if you want more of a shell). I must say that they are very well stuffed with fresh and flavorful ingredients! Probably the best $2 Taco Tuesday deal I've had in a long time!! Someone at our table was also celebrating a birthday and the waiter brought out Churros with ice cream for dessert. They were warm and crispy...I'm not a sweets person but they were delicious! In the past I've had the nachos during Happy Hour which are $5 and they are also very plentiful and delicious. The food here is very good. \n\nDRINKS: Taco Tuesday offers up $3 Coronas, $8 Skinny Margaritas, and $20 massive margaritas. Drinks are made well and as expected. The other drink prices are comparable to the area. I'd say an average of $8-$12 for cocktails. \n\nParking during high volume times can be very frustrating. There is a designated lot across the street which fills up fast and is hard to access due to tight spaces. Side streets also offer limited parallel parking due to recent building of apartments nearby. Prepare to circle or walk from another location. \n\nOverall, Green Lemon is a great little trendy Mexican place on South Howard. While I wouldn't consider it true Mexican cuisine, they do a great job of satisfying the locale with a trendy menu and a party environment. Prices are good and it's a nice place to check out. If you are fine with large crowds, tons of noise and are patient...give Taco Tuesday a try! It's a great deal and your hunger will be satisfied.",

I enjoyed a ham and cheese croissant which was flaky, buttery deliciousness. \n\nI read something on their website about how tables can be reserved for $10/hour. Since I was meeting with one of my team members I decided to reserve a table for two hours. When I arrived on that weekday morning, the coffee shop was empty save for one or two other people. So, I most likely wouldn't formally reserve a table again unless I was going at a peak time - seemed like kind of a waste of money. Although, your reservation does get you a 20% discount on all food and drink orders. And I suppose if you really needed to guarantee a table for a work meeting, it's good to know that Rally offers this, since I can't think of a single other place that does. So there's pros and cons to that. \n\nI am looking forward to returning!",

After our food was served my guest and I observed this woman (owner) berate another staff person right in front of us. She yelled at the employee, \"this isn't your job.

Weekends are usually the best to get parking. \n\nAside from that this place is a must try if you're craving authentic Mexican food! They offer burritos, tacos, sopes, alambres, etc...\n\nMy fave has to be the chicken Tinga sopes which is shredded marinated chicken and the gorditas! The sope and gorditas are both handmade with masa. What I love about them is the thickness is made just right and not too much. I can actually finish them without being overly stuffed. \n\nI've also had the chicken taquitos plate which was a good deal under $10! Very yummy and satisfying. \n\nThe carne asada burrito was good but the amount of meat was lacking yet again! Another restaurant that skimps on the main feature. \n\nOverall this place is legit and I look forward to trying more items on the menu.",

I'm not sure if I would have liked a full butterscotch or full marshmallow shake even more, but the blend of the two was great. \n\nMy wife ordered a sundae and it was pretty much your average sundae.

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because you'll pay for it, but it's hard to imagine the quality being better with any other fence company.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nWe bought our house a few years ago and one of the first things we planned on doing was upgrading the existing fence. Unfortunately, we spent our money elsewhere and found ourselves making due with a pretty beaten down fence since we moved in. But after about the 15th time where some boards just fell down, we decided that it was finally time.\n\nI walk my dog a lot through the nearby neighborhoods and every time I see a super nice fence that really stands out, it's always a Redman Fence. And I've had Redman bookmarked on Yelp for years because of the great ratings. So maybe this wasn't the smartest decision, but we had Redman come out to give us a quote and the next day and quickly opted to put down a deposit without getting a quote elsewhere.\n\nWhen I've mentioned to people how much our fence cost, the reaction is usually that we paid a bit more. That may be so, but I think it was worth it for three reasons:\n\n1) The quality of the product is top notch.\n\n2) Reliability of the installers - they actually showed up when they said they would every day, which is a rarity in this industry, sadly.\n\n3) They offered financing for a low fee.\n\nI'll nitpick here and mention a few things I didn't love, just to give the full spectrum of our experience:\n\n1) We were told by the owner that it would only be one day that our fence would be down before the new one would be up enough to keep pets in. That ended up not being true at all - the project started on a Monday and by the end of the day on Thursday, the perimeter with the other houses was secure enough for pets, but our gate was the last thing to be put up, which did not happen until the following Monday. Now that I've seen a fence install from start to finish, the owner quoting us \"one day\" was very unrealistic.\n\n2) The guys cleaned up a bit, but also definitely let some trash scattered around. They also left some yard debris and it would have been nice for them to either take it or at least offer to put everything in our yard trash can that was sitting empty in the backyard.\n\nThat's really about it, though. Overall, the product turned out great. The installers were here every day but Sunday and they'd work from around 10:30a-5:30p, seemingly without a break. It was about one month from the time we put down a deposit until the install began. \n\nThe quality of their work is top notch and I'm really happy that I will not even have to think about my fence for the rest of the time we live in this house.",

He was a super cool cat and remembered me the next time I came through!\n\nAnyway, I was starving on my first visit, so I ordered snails for the appetizer and a whole branzini.

But I have no qualms about eating the whole fish, and I basically ate it down to the bone!  Since I was at an establishment, I didn't get down and dirty with the fish head, if I was in the comfort of my own home, it's a different story...\n\nThe second time I came around, I ordered the lamb shank.  It was falling off the bone, and simply divine!

  "text": "It's really hard for me to give a spot a 1 star rating, I reserve that for a truly awful experience. Cosi was bad. \nI was on my way to see a movie at the Ritz Bourse (a very entertaining movie called \"Kill The Irishman\") and I was early so I walked across the street to Cosi for a quick bite. Well it wasn't quick and I miss a couple of minutes of the flick. \nThere was only I guy in line, but I still had to wait 10 minutes to order my meal. I chose the Buffalo Bleu sandwich, a bowl of Tomato Basil Soup and a cup of Coffee. It took awhile to order because the cashier was busy doing everything else but taking orders. She repeated \"I'll be with you in a moment 3 times. They give you a numbered place card that you have to display on a wired cardholder so one of the server can locate your table. \nThe restaurant wasn't crowded at all (hint, hint) and I could of sat anywhere, I was going to sit in one of those odd shaped booths, but they looked dirtier that the backseat of a Bronx Taxicab on a Saturday midnight run, so I sat in one of the small table for two feeling like I was sitting at a third grader sized school desk & chair. \nThe food came and it was so bland-how can you call something Buffalo Chicken with absolutely zero spice? And the bread was some fake rustic, gummy square that was totally tasteless. The soup was OK and the coffee was average at best. And to top it off, I really had to go to the bathroom and my teeth were floating, but the way to the men's room was like a freakin maze! I counted 5 turns till you reach the toilet, bloody hell!!",

  "text": "I love my Marriotts! Let's start with my seamless check-in. Rhia was so sweet. She was able to quickly find my mobile check-in. She even walked around the corner to give me my keys. \n\nOur room was on the 28th floor. Loved the view of the Mississippi view. Our room was giant, but the bathroom was pretty small. The light in the bathroom was bright! I called the lighting \"the hangover fixer\". It's soooo bright.\n\nFor you platinum elite and higher Marriott rewards peeps, the M lounge is great! Breakfast includes made-to-order omelettes and fresh made beignets. There was a huge spread, including exotic fruit. Loved the papaya and dragonfruit.\n\nThe location of the hotel was great. We were literally 2 blocks from Bourbon Street. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton and the Saint in NOLA, by far this Marriott is the best location for easy access to the French Quarters. \n\nNOLA was a success and would definitely stay at this Marriott again!",

  "text": "Santa's Naughty Little Yelpers decided to meet up for an Unofficial Yelp Event at The Shops at Wiregrass in Wesley Chapel to enjoy the spectacular Christmas lights. But first, we elected to stop for dinner at 900 degree Wood-Fired Pizza at the mall.\n\nUnfortunately many of our naughty little elves were home sick, nursing colds and assorted ickies, but Erin P, Robbie C, Joel H and I forced ourselves to party like rockstars and enjoy some outstanding pizza and great laughs.\n\nThe temps were a bit chilly that night, but we were able to sit outside on their covered patio right next to a big ol' propane gas heater. The patio was enclosed on three sides with heavy canvas siding, and the heaters were pumping out the BTU's all evening, so we were quite toasty.\n\n900 Degree Wood-Fired Pizza is family owned pizzeria restaurant that serves both Neapolitan-style wood-fired pizza and the traditional thin-crust NY-Style pizza. I read about the two different styles of pizzas and opted to try one of the smaller Neapolitan pizzas. These are made with Antico Caputo \"00\" flour imported from Italy, and the sauce is made from crushed San Marzano DOP tomatoes with basil. Nothing else. I read on the menu that the cheese is fresh, imported mozzarella and all of their toppings are cooked and prepared from scratch. YUM!!!!\n\nI started with their Mista salad which was mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, and homemade Italian dressing, and followed that with a 12 \" Capricciosa wood-fired pizza that had the San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella slices, artichoke hearts, ham, mushrooms, Kalamata olives and fresh basil. Seriously amazing!\n\nThe menu has a wide variety of suggested specialty pizzas, or you can choose to build your own, and add whatever toppings you like. They also serve salads, calzones, pasta dishes, and dessert pizzas made with Nutella and other yummy stuff.\n\nThe four of us had a great time enjoying our food and socializing next to the space heaters. We declared the restaurant a big success, and I'll gladly make the haul from Carrollwood up to Wesley Chapel to try another one of their pizzas.\n\nBy the way, the lights on the Christmas tree at the mall are synched to Trans-Siberian Orchestra's music, which made for a great show. They also had two vocal groups who were belting out the Holiday hits and Christmas standards. We thoroughly enjoyed our informal get-together of excellent pizza and Christmas cheer with good friends.",

  "text": "I think I'm hooked. I've been itching to go to one of Ballet Idaho's shows for years, and I am thrilled that my first experience was with the Christmas classic, The Nutcracker. \n\nThere were so many components of this performance that won me over--the combination of professional dancers performing with children from Ballet Idaho's Academy, the live music played by the Boise Philarmonic, and the contrast of beautiful dancing paired with humorous bits that got the whole audience chuckling. \n\nIn my opinion, the first act is mostly storytelling, whereas the second act features the more complex dance pieces. I enjoyed both parts equally and thought that they combined to make for a dreamy entertainment experience--one that was both intelligent and humorous.\n\nThe entire show had me pulled in with the same wide-eyed wonder my friend's three-year-old daughter had. I think that is perhaps my favorite part of this whole experience, the feel in the building is so child-like. Before and after the show and during intermission, the lobby of the Morrison Center was buzzing with people of all ages. And during intermission, the top balcony overlooking the lobby outside of the auditorium had a group of grade-school kids singing Christmas carols. \n\nTo put the cherry on top of an already amazing evening, as soon as we stepped out of the building, we experienced our first Boise snowfall of the year. Talk about magical, eh?\n\nPro Tip: If you are parking in the garage right outside of the Morrison Center, try to get there a little early and get a space on the first floor. We parked on the second floor and it took us about half an hour to get out. Eeeeeep.",

They have some sweet deals on food if you're hungry...I can't remember the exact price, but I'm pretty sure it was under $5 maybe even under $4? The roast duck looked really good. It is so clean it reminds me of a Publix actually and they even have these little stands with recipes so you can find what you're looking for or maybe decide what to buy with their help. The workers are were friendly and the selection of things to buy was great as well. I found all my favorite Asian snacks. So happy to have this in town :)",

  "text": "As an avid lover of books, I'll admit that I've been spending some of my recent driving time in the community checking on the welfare of our local, indie bookstores and doing what I can do to support them as they work to survive what has been a challenging pandemic for even the sturdiest of businesses. \n\nBooks on Sale is a little gem that has, I think much to the surprise of many, survived several years now since it first opened in 2008 in its nondescript corner of Southern Plaza across a rear parking lot from the AMC Showplace 17. \n\nBooks on Sale is a sister store to Red Dog Books. It looks and feels like a non-corporate Half-Price Books because that's essentially what it is. Books on Sale offers a Buy 3 Get 2 Free deal and it's hard to imagine visiting here and not finding 5 books, or many more, that you would want. \n\nBooks on Sale offers new, used, and remainder items. They nearly always have sale tables. I would note that they are \"disorganized\" in the sense that they do not electronically catalogue their books and they do not have a logged inventory according to their website. They do have some awareness of what they offer, but this is a used bookstore at its heart and you're going to have to do some scavenging. Personally? I enjoy that. \n\nBooks on Sale offers books, CDs, DVDs, journals, vinyl, audio books, and they have an entire room at 50% off. This place is surprisingly huge. \n\nWhile Books on Sale is relatively disorganized, it's also surprisingly well kept and neat. As a wheelchair user, I had little difficulty with most of the aisles and there's accessible parking and easy curbs at Southern Plaza. Southern Plaza went through a renovation a few years back and has a weird vibe that is both contemporary and retro. \n\nVinyl prices start at $1.98. All single DVDs and CDs are $1.98. They have collections of TV series marked at $3.98. I mean, seriously. Their prices are easily better than chains and some of these prices are better than what you'd find at a garage sale. \n\nEmployees are always friendly, though you should probably not expect them to know the exact location of that 13th copy of Twilight that you need. Generally, they can point you in the right direction and you'll need to do some searching. \n\nI love bookstores like Books on Sale. It's cozy, warm, has a bookstore feeling, and is locally owned and operated. Prices are fair and they have a little bit of everything. This is one of Indy's true gems and I was so relieved to return last evening while at a promo screening across the street and see that Books on Sale continues to survive and thrive in its corner as a beacon for indie bookstores here in Indy.",

  "text": "A beautiful independently owned studio in the heart of Ewing!  Empower Yoga is a breath of fresh air, just like the owner, Keri, is herself!  \n\nWalking into the studio, you can tell it was a labor of love - every detail had been pre-planned and thoughtfully implemented; from the colorful organization/storage for guests' belongings, to the aromatherapy diffuser, multiple benches, and even the bathrooms with a shower (yes, a SHOWER) stocked with soaps and amenities for those who need to shower before work/leaving yoga.  Everytime I walk in, I'm welcomed with a smile and a genuine conversation from either the owner herself, or one of her amazing staff members.\n\nI've taken a variety of classes from different instructors, and each one is better than the last - some of my favorites include Hip Hop Yoga (get ready to sweat your booty off in this one!) and any class that Keri teaches (she's going to challenge you).  Most classes are intense Core Power Yoga, and the owner is an amazing yogi/marathoner/crossfit coach/ironman champion - she's usually found before class happily chatting with her students discussing safety while working out or ways to make adjustments in order to avoid triggering injuries if you're struggling with something.  It's very comforting to know that she's conscious about this, and looking out for her students! \n\nThe studio is a feature in the relatively new Campus Town at TCNJ - there (at this point) is usually available parking outside the studio doors, or around the corner.  Parking is free (bonus!)  There is one studio room, but it's very large (with super high ceilings).  There are 2 doors into/out of the room, which adds to great air flow and helps rapidly cool the room from the ~93 degrees in which we practice.  \n\nOne thing to note, the studio does hot yoga, which I've never experienced but I am now a total convert.  The studio is complete with a humidifier to maintain a healthy heat for the yogis.  Despite everyone dripping sweat by the end (or to be realistic, within 3 minutes of class starting), the studio smells clean and fresh - there is a lot of attention to keeping the studio clean and smell free, which is greatly appreciated!  The scents are never overpowering or artificial - despite it being a yoga studio, it feels a little bit like walking into a spa.  Each class is finished with an eucalyptus-scented cold damp towel, which is provided during savasana - a blissful way to end an amazing workout! \n\nEmpower Yoga is committed to being part of the community, and often has multiple community events going on - from community fundraising classes, to trainings, and even promotions.  This month (October 2018) she's running a challenge for her students, anyone who comes 3/week for the entire month is entered into a raffle to win prizes, gift certificates, or experiences from other local Campus Town businesses.  Work out more to win prizes - sounds like a win-win!\n\nPrices are pretty competitive for the area - and discounts are offered the more often you attend.  Currently there's a $40 unlimited for 4 weeks pass offered to new guests only.  Regular drop-in classes are $12, but class packs are offered at an even lower rate: 5 class pack- $55, 10 class pack- $100, and 20 class packs- $180.  Online lists discounts for student/military/seniors and monthly/annual auto-enroll as well.  \n\nCome check it out - you probably won't want to leave!",

Every participant followed the rules and the time guidelines, and the event moved along seamlessly, with a short but necessary break for intermission. \n\nIf you haven't yet seen or participated in a Story Slam, they take place about once a month and they provide a fun, different kind of night out.",

I was able to park easily and quickly get inside. I can see on a busy day how this might not be the case. They do offer valet. I went on a Wednesday and entry was free. On other days it is a few dollars. The facility had a dirty rundown feel to it, to me. I have not been around so many people who smoke in probably 20 years. Smoke happens to really bother me so I had issues being comfortable breathing!! Lol. You may stand outside along the track to watch the horses race. We sat in the box seating area. This was not any nicer other than the fact it was covered and you had a seat. Visually I could see just fine. Drinks were cheap. Thank goodness they had alcohol to ease my discomfort  in being here! They do have a limited menu, however I only got popcorn. Food prices were inexpensive. I understand they do have lots of activities on weekends that are family friendly. In one review, I read that they will open up a gate where you can picnic and bring lawn chairs. I might like to try this so I can soak up the sun. I found the experience to be underwhelming. Years ago I went to a track in New Jersey that was much nicer than what I observed here.",

A good restaurant all in all. \n\nI need to try the desserts the next time I'm there!",

  "text": "One of the more popular spots in St. Petersburg (obviously) since it took us quite a long time to get a table. We were able to enjoy some drinks at the outside bar while we waited for a table indoors. They have a nice outdoor patio but on this particular evening, it was a touch too chilly to eat outdoors. The sangria was okay.\n\nWe were a fairly low-maintenance 6-top but since our server would disappear for semi-long periods of time, when she would reappear, we'd have a lot of requests. Like trying to get 6 drink refills or order a single basket of chips and salsa. Which by the way- the chips and salsa you have to pay for. Hm okay. Most places at least give you the first basket for free but that is not the case here.\n\nI had the duck torta with yucca fries. Pretty delicious actually though I kind of wished I had gotten the duck tacos instead. The insanely strong (but awesome) strawberry and pineapple caipirinha was also great. Everyone else seemed pretty happy with their food options. We were just very unimpressed with the service.",

  "text": "ISC met June 29. Thanks, Sarah S., for your continual spot-on restaurant selection.\n\nEl Agave is in Watson Plaza, a large, C-shaped shopping center, with Kohl's at the top (facing west), Shop 'n Save facing Watson and El Agave at the bottom (facing east). Just turn in when you see Kohl's.\n\nThis may be the largest Mexican restaurant I've ever patronized. There's a lovely separate bar and numerous smallish dining areas.\n\nOur server was pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu. I asked him for a recommendation, and that's what I got. But I don't know its name. The menu is sporting a picture of it. Nopales are involved.\n\nAnd this massive, wonderful dish was served in a huge black \"pottery\" footed bowl lined with foil. Besides nopales, there was chicken, shrimp, pico, sour cream and vegetables . . . no doubt other things.\n\nThis was the first time in my life I've had a Mexican dish that didn't include tortillas. And that includes Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and all villages down the road from Cancun to Tulum and up the road from Mexico City to Taxco.\n\nAnd I was more than ecstatic with that.\n\nDang-bang it, was that good and continued to be fabulous with the abundance in my to-go vessel.\n\nIt was a fun evening with fellow Yelpers. Service was just right. Water was replenished in a timely fashion. And it seemed like everyone was pleased with their selections.",

  "text": "THIS IS MY FAVORITE TARGET IN THE COUNTRY! Ok, I apologize for the shouting but I needed to express my pure, unadulterated love for this Target! Now I grew up in NOLA ya'll but have lived in Chicago, Long Beach and L.A. and have sought out the nearest Target in all of these places. I have also been to The original Target store in Minnesota (no, I'm nuts, my ex was from Minnesota and it happened to be their neighborhood store) so I consider myself a Tar-jayyyy expert (fancy pronunciation for Target! Hehe).\n\nI remember my first experience at Target in Burbank, CA when my older cousin brought my Mom and I there to pick up some stuff while we were on vacay. I had no idea that this store would be so clean, pretty, and relatively inexpensive. I was a kid back then. It that experience stayed with me forever.\n\nThen I remember when BatonRouge got their first Target and my friends were telling me how they would drive just to go to Target. I understood what they meant. I kinda feel that way about Trader Joe's too but don't get me started.\n\nAnywho, Target is better than Wal-Mart hands down in terms of shopping experience. But Wal-Mart does seem cheaper and they are my go to for cheap meds and are closer to me). This particular Target has two floors and is bigger than the one on the wank. It has parking in the front and multi-level covered parking in the back (hint, there is parking that is connected to the second floor which is convenient if you want to shop there then watch a movie afterwards in Clearview).\n\nThere is a full size food section although not as much variety as Rouse's. I am happy they have a decent wine selection as well.  \n\nKeep in mind that I can literally go up and down each aisle and just meander around and have a good time. I love how the store is well kept, well-lit, and aisles are big and spacious (unlike Wal-Mart where I try to get in and out ASAP). I also appreciate that Target has big-name designers (read Michael Kors and even Neiman Marcus Wow!) come in and do a Target line. Isaac Mizrahi did great stuff, Mossimo is standard, etc.\n\nI also love the cheap bins up front where I find cute little gifts for my nieces which I spoil bc every time I see them I have a little cheapie gift for them (yes I spoil them. It  what favorite aunties do when they co-babysit!)! They love Hello Kitry, Disney and princess's stuff so it's a win-win situation!\n\nPlus they are open later for holiday hours. Keep in mind I love Target so much I can also bring my recycling there (only place to my knowledge where I can recycle glass). I have also been known to close down the store and go to the same Target two days in a row (don't judge dammit!).\n\nIt was dangerous when I had a Target card so had to get rid of that! Hehe...plus Target donates to local schools. And they great their employees better than Wal-Mart treats their employees.\n\nHappy shopping ya'll'",

  "text": "Trattoria Il Mulino is an upscale Italian restaurant on the first floor of the Hilton in downtown Nashville. The restaurant has locations in New York, Atlantic City and Orlando in addition to this Nashville location. My friend and I chose to come here because we were going to a concert at the Ryman and this is right down the street from the venue. We got lucky and managed to grab 2 seats at the bar since we did not have a reservation. \n\nAmbiance: 4/5\n\nThe restaurant is dimly lit and the feel is modern and elegant. The main dining room of the restaurant has a huge wine cellar that is backlit which makes for quite a sight as there are hundreds of bottles. Even being seated at the bar, all the places were set and wine glasses were set out as well. \n\nService: 4/5\n\nOur server was pretty attentive even for a busy Friday night. I did have to ask for the check since she was busy mixing drinks and running around but she brought it within 5 minutes after I asked so that was good. Other servers are walking around with the bread and looking to take dishes away as well. \n\nFood/Drink: 4/5\n\nWe kicked off our meal with a couple of cocktails. I got one called the Casino which has gin, orange bitters, simple syrup and lemon. It also had a skewer with 2 maraschino cherries on it. The drink was strong but slightly sweet which I really enjoyed. I would absolutely come back just for drinks as the cocktails are great.\n\nThey bring out a complementary appetizer which is a soft eggplant dish with breadcrumbs and salami circling the outside. Surprisingly this was my favorite thing I tried--the appetizer was so delicious! Throughout the meal a server will come by and offer you your choice of bread from a large basket--they have Italian, ciabatta, mini garlic bread and multigrain. I tried one of each and they were all excellent! The bread was soft and fresh and was a really nice touch. For an appetizer my friend got the Caesar salad which we split. The homemade dressing was super good and this was a nice and simple dish to get our meal started.\n\nFor the main entree we both got pasta. The server came around and grated some fresh cheese for the top which I love about Italian restaurants because I could have a mountain of cheese on there before I stop them. I got the gnocchi which comes in a bolognese sauce. This was a huge dish and I could not finish it. It came out piping hot so I had to wait a few minutes but this was a really delicious dish. My friend got the ravioli which are filled with arugula and goat cheese and topped off with a vodka sauce. The portion isn't a lot because it is a rich dish but the flavor and quality of the dish are there. \n\nThe overall experience was great (4/5) although on the pricey side. Just a matter of personal preference that I'm more of a dive bar/ comfortable feel sort of place. This is definitely a great choice for dining downtown for the convenience and we had a good experience.",

Although the Tampa Bay area has seen an EXPLOSION in the number of breweries ever since a millionaire owner of gentlemen's clubs started injecting money into the craft beer industry...this area is still a relative beer desert.\n\nThere weren't any foodcarts when I was here, but I love that setup!

  "text": "Wow, it feels like ages since I visited this Hard Rock Café at Tampa International Airport on opening day, but that's what happens when you live your life out of a suitcase, and don't have enough time to sit down and write reviews.\n\nThe Hard Rock Café is a welcome addition to the restaurant options at the airport. You'll find the HRC in the east wing of Tampa International Airport's main terminal, between the shuttles to terminals C and A on the third (main) floor. The HRC Airport Café is the first time that the famed Hard Rock chain has opened a location inside of an airport. The restaurant / bar has 4,500 square feet of space, complete with a sound stage, roadie cases, and sound trusses; and they have seating for 120 guests. As with all HRC's, the restaurant has musical memorabilia located in display cases all around the dining room.\n\nIf you have time to sit down and enjoy your meal, the restaurant has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the airfield at Tampa International Airport, and it's easy to lose track of time as you watch the planes and ground crews scurrying around. Be sure to tell your server your \"drop dead\" time so they make sure that you receive your food, and get your check in plenty of time to catch your flight.\n\nRight behind the hostess counter is the Hard Rock store, so if you want a collector's pin, or a t-shirt, or any of their other merchandise, you can stop here before dashing to your flight. The bar area is to the right of the hostess stand, and there are several high-top tables as well as the main bar in this section of the restaurant. The wall behind the bar is a huge video screen, overlooking a sound stage, and then the bar itself.\n\nThe restaurant menu will look familiar to frequent visitors of the Hard Rock chain, with the traditional appetizers, salads, burgers, sammies, smokehouse specials, and entrée specials. If you're in a hurry, grab a burger, or a wrap, or a salad; but if you have more time then sit back and order an entrée special as you enjoy the sights.\n\nThe food is good, and the servers were still learning the system on the day that I was there. I'm quite sure that they have this machine humming along by now, and would recommend that you give them a try on your next flight out of Tampa.",

It's a dim lit and cozy place but very noisy.  The other customers are nice and it's not at all a stuffy atmosphere. I think it's because the staff is friendly.\n\nThey serve a small portion of bread which was fine; the main courses are huge. I couldn't finish my chicken cutlet with prosciutto, buffalo moz, arugula and tomatoes ( i asked them to hold the prosciutto and they accommodated my request). Everyone is nice, they know their menu and everything was very well prepared. I liked my aunt's dish - the seasoning and flavors were complex but I'm not a braised meat person and wasn't in the mood for pasta or fish. The chicken cutlet was delicious and juicy; I think it either had a light sauce or the chicken breast was marinated - either way it was special. \n\nMy aunt ordered a single scoop of salted caramel gelato (off menu item) for dessert and decaf earl grey tea - it was Stash's! She really enjoyed everything! I enjoyed mine too but I agree with her - if you like braised meats order the Oasobuco it's a perfect cold weather dish!\n\nIt's BYOB and they take credit cards, what more could you want?",

The place is modest, decorated like a miniature diner.\n\nHot dog snobs may turn up their noses at their dogs, but I'm no snob. Don't expect their dogs to be authentic copies of your regional favorites, and you'll be fine.\n\nTheir dogs aren't the biggest, which means you'll need to order more than one. On the bright side, that lets you try different varieties. The Boston style with baked beans isn't bad. The Texas Ranger with barbecue sauce and fried onions is tasty, as is their zesty Tijuana dog, with jalapenos, sport peppers, chopped onions, and a light hot sauce, one that only the weaksauce will find spicy. Their Chicago style dog is their weakest offering, sadly, as it doesn't use a proper bun.\n\nPrices are such that you won't be eating here everyday. Besides, that's unhealthy.\n\nGet fries and onion rings with your meal, and try their soft serve vanilla ice cream for dessert - with cones! Days they're open past 4:30 PM, you can even get a FREE BEER with your order. Try them yourself!",

  "text": "Time warp. I guess I'm just accustomed to the contemporary. Upon entering the gate, you need your credit card or room key. The person that works the reception appears on a screen if you need any assistance at the gate.\n\nNow, for checking in.. The same person on screen at the gate is at the front desk still.. ON SCREEN. A large screen is at the front desk interacting with you to get you checked in. She tells you where to grab your keys and where to pick up your parking pass. Hopefully the parking pass won't be jammed in the printer and you'll get the right one. We picked up the wrong one so we thought our room was someone else's. We tried entering the room and saw other people were already in it. So, we returned to the front desk and learned our real room number.\n\nThe room had a kitchen, bathroom, and living space downstairs that led out a sliding door to a small deck. The upstairs had two bedrooms with a bathroom in between, not adjoining. It's a serious throwback. Tiny TV from the 80's, no cable. They did, however, have a DVD player. The kitchen was fully equipped with utensils, pots, plates, etc. Some of the utensils were dirty. No sponge to clean them.. just the dishwasher but who wants to run the dishwasher for a few utensils? \n\nThis place needs to be updated BADLY. And \"resort\" should be removed from the name.",

  "text": "The Mongolian BBQ line here has become one of my favorite places to visit; it is actually somewhat of a weekend tradition now between the SO and me.\n\nI agree that you can find better Chinese entrees elsewhere, but the buffet here is actually really good compared to other offerings elsewhere. Someone I met today from San Diego said this is his favorite place to eat in town.\n\nIt's great because there is a wide variety of ingredients with lots of vegetables (bok choy!) and nine different sauces to dress up your creation. Peanuts for topping too. \n\nThe meats are frozen thin slices so I pass on all of them except the pork; unlike the others it doesn't turn out dry and tough, I'm guessing because of the higher fat content. \n\nShrimp is available too in addition to imitation crab and scallops at dinner.\n\nThe same chef (\"wizard\" as my SO calls him) has been here every visit of mine lunch and dinner except one time. I could really tell the difference that once. He does a really great job so I recommend bringing cash for his tip container. He's very nice too. \n\nThere is another line of pre-cooked foods that rotate on occasion. See my photos.\n\nTL;DR: Everyone has been friendly all my visits and the freshly cooked BBQ is the way to go. Will be back lots more.",

  "text": "This was my absolute favorite meal I ate in New Orleans, and trust me... I ate A LOT of meals. I love you, Gumbo Shop!\n\nOur Lyft driver recommended this spot to us while we drove into New Orleans from the airport during our first afternoon in town. A few days later, we finally had some free time to stop in, and I was so satisfied with our experience. \n\nWe arrived around 1:30pm, which I thought might be a good time to visit since it's a bit after the normal lunch rush, but there was still quite a long line in the foyer of the restaurant. Luckily, the line moved quickly and efficiently, and were seated in no less than 10 minutes. While we waited, I began to notice the gorgeous decor and colors inside, and that the shop features two all-gender restrooms.  There was also a specials board featuring some appetizers and a gumbo plate that wasn't on the printed menu.\n\nOnce we were seated, we had a chance to look at the menu, and our waiter reiterated the specials. Gumbo Shop offers plenty of gumbo options, of course, and at fair prices. I thought they might easily charge a good amount of money for a dish, since there are always long lines outside, but their low prices may be *why* the lines are so long. Who can resist a delicious deal? I am a big fan of seafood -- and since we're in New Orleans I trust the seafood will be amazing at most places -- so I ordered the seafood okra gumbo. My boyfriend decided on the creole combination platter. \n\nWhile we waited for our food, we each ordered a beer. Gumbo Shop features some rotating options, and on this particular day they were featuring two Abita brand pours: an amber and a blonde. My boyfriend ordered the amber, and I went with the blonde. Our waiter brought these out within a few minutes, along with some bread and butter. Who doesn't love some bread and butter to start off a hearty meal?! The answer is that everyone does. \n\nWhen our food was on its way out, I got so pumped, because this was my first time eating gumbo, EVER... and once I tasted this gumbo, I knew I'd been spoiled. I will never taste gumbo as good as the one I experienced here at Gumbo Shop. Please, please, if you visit New Orleans, you must eat here. I promise the wait is much shorter than you'll expect, because service is impressive and efficient here, and the prices are low. You'll absolutely love it. \n\nI can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!",

  "text": "First off, it's important to note that despite reports to the otherwise The Grub House is, in fact, open. \n\nI've always been curious about this restaurant at 20th and College. It looks like a comfort food joint. It's in a rather non-descript, somewhat divey building but I tend to love just this type of restaurant. \n\nMy experience, however, is with delivery as I decided to take a day off work and ended up using a delivery gift card a friend had provided. I checked out my options and was delighted to see The Grub House as one of them. \n\nIt does appear from social media that The Grub House went through a period of inactivity, however, I'm excited to report that it's back in action and the food itself was comfort food extraordinaire. \n\nI ordered a Grub Burger combo with a Sweet Tea. I was delighted that the burgers are made to order and I was even more delighted when my burger arrived medium well as I had ordered.  The burger was a decent size burger and it was awesomely prepared. \n\nI also ordered Grub Fries. These fries were absolutely delightful. They're uniquely made and perfectly seasoned. \n\nIt's not the easiest thing in the world to prepare food for delivery, however, I was pleased that my food was still warm when it arrived at my south Lawrence home. \n\nThe sweet tea definitely hit the spot, as well. \n\nI definitely don't know the full scoop behind The Grub House, but I do know that's where I had an absolutely delightful lunch today and I won't hesitate to order from them or drop by their College Avenue location again. The Grub House is a true Indy indie business with comfort food that really hits the spot.",

You can usually find one in any major city, which works when you need something in a pinch and prefer natural products. The packaging is fun and loud, and the names and descriptions are always creative. \n\nI find employees to be a bit pushy sometimes, however, I had an easy in and out experience this week when I recycled some old containers for a brand new face mask - brazened honey. I can't wait to try it! Because the products are natural, they often have a shelf life (some have to be refrigerated!), which is understandable but can be preventative when it comes to committing to a full-sized purchase. \n\nFinally, some of their bath bombs have left color behind on my tub. It's always removable, but that doesn't happen with the bombs from my local spot. Nonetheless, I'm still a fan and enjoy a lot of their products!",

  "text": "1702, aptly named for it's address along Speedway, is a pizza joint I've wanted to try for years. I set aside a special time to go, because, really, who can deny giant slices of pizza?\n\nThe inside of 1702 is a lot divey-er than I expected, however, it reminds me of a very popular pizza place in Salt Lake City, near the University, so it was almost like being back home.\n\nI had previously checked out their menu, but still spent a few minutes deciding what type of pizza to have, as well as beer. The employees... seemed especially surly. The certain beer I was interested in (Almanac's Cherry Picker) did not have a price next to it, and when I asked, I got a response that was pretty much \"It says it on the board\". I pointed out that this was not the case, and after a solid minute, I finally got a price for it. $6 for a 10oz pour (so, fairly pricey, but I really wanted to try it.)\n\nWe ordered a single slice of the Presto to share between two. We waited a while for our slice to come out, but it was definitely worth it. The pizza slice is giant. It's definitely a meal for more than just one. They bring it out on a pizza pan, with your own pizza cutter.  I was in heaven, and very happy that I was sharing. \n\nDespite the surly workers and the long wait, I really feel like 1702 is a necessity stop if you are a student at U of A - especially because it is all too close to campus. In fact, there were even some students working on computers when we stopped in. I know this is exactly what I'd be doing if I were a student in Tucson: beerin and pizza-ing myself up. YUM!",

  "text": "A solid 4 stars.  We came here last week on our anniversary jaunt to Santa Barbara.  After a long day of whale watching and wine tasting, the last thing we ended up being in the mood for was a fancy dinner.  As it turned out, the Sage and Onion was absolutely lovely.  We were served an amouse buche of some kind of yummy thick blended tomato-y soup in a cute little espresso cup.  The truffled white cheddar souffle was a delicious beginning, and surprisingly light and fluffy, it didn't weigh us down but got us excited about the main course.  Our main courses were fantastic.  Mine was steak with scalloped potatoes and rapini that were to die for.  Hers was ahi perfectly seared tuna in a coconut curry lemongrass sauce, and she LOVED it.  The owner said hello, and even gave us some unbelievable cabernet (on the house, it was a 2003 Jordan Cabernet that was the best wine of the trip).  I was so full by dessert that I only ordered sorbet, which was as sweet and refreshing as I'd hoped it would be.  It was a wonderful night, and made our anniversary not just the special night it was, but special AND tasty!  And the waiter was adorable to boot (just look for the tall, dark, and handsome guy)!  We'll happily return next time we're in SB.",

  "text": "What an incredible experience!\n\nPerfect for foodie, wannabe foodies, Top Chef lovers, and the adventurous diner!\n\nMy boyfriend surprised me with our anniversary dinner here for our 6th year after hearing it was on my Nashville bucket list. He was able to get a Wednesday night reservation with only a day notice. It may be more difficult on the weekends. \n\nThey offer complimentary valet parking here. Situated underneath The Patterson House, we arrived a few minutes early and decided to head there first to grab pre-dinner drinks before we were allowed in. Come to find out, we could bring our drinks into the restaurant as well without rushing. \n\nUpon entering the main door, you enter a tiny holding area with an elevator that actually takes you up to the main restaurant area. Very incognito spy-like feels.\n\nThe restaurant itself is an open kitchen where you immediately see all the chefs and sous chefs plating each and every delicate dish. We lucked out by having the best seat in the house, right in the center/middle of the U shaped serving area. \n\nWe were greeted by multiple chefs, sous chefs and other kitchen staff who made sure we had no needs that went unnoticed. Every course of thoroughly explained prior to being devoured by yours truly. \n\nIn total, we had 10 glorious courses, 2 of which were dessert. I will spare you the details since the menu is always evolving and you may not get the same courses. Let's just I was able to try delicious cavier, sea urchin and a melt-in-your-mouth steak. Portions are small, but after eating 10 of anything, you will leave satisfied but not feeling uncomfortably full. My normally spam-and-eggs boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed all the courses and raved about many of them. \n\nWe also opted for the wine pairing with our meal, one of which was actually sake. Since we already got drinks at Patterson House and my boyfriend doesn't care to drink wine, we opted for just one pairing to share. There were about 6 pairings with smaller than average pours. Definitely just enough to enjoy the course with but not enough to get you drunk. As a self-proclaimed lush, I was not even buzzed after all the pairings. I suppose if you're not a drinker, you may be more intoxicated. Sometimes having a high tolerance has its pros and cons. \n\nAt the end of our meal, we got a Mr. Potato Head cookie jar with in-house-made cookies to enjoy. We were also presented with our own personalized menu detailing all our courses and drink pairing. Overall, I had a fantastic experience and would recommend this to anyone who is interested in more than just your average dining experience.",

And the bread souffle was absolutely wonderful.  \n\nThe service was nice but they didn't ask if we were celebrating something which it was my sister's bday.  I never could find our waiter to tell him. \n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable meal though definitely not my favorite from our New Orleans trip.",

Oh dear, I exclaimed as I rushed to retrieve it from the concrete. But I was too late. The screen had shattered leaving jagged pieces of glass and my record of phone safety destroyed.

There were couches and magazines to occupy my time since I couldn't play on my phone like normal.

I'll eventually go to more then compare! But for a first time pedicare, this was good!",

We had a big group, so we sat outside on their front patio so we could fit everyone. I got a cucumber-gimlet-type cocktail that was delicious, albeit quite sour. We had a good time within our group, but our server was incredibly rude. We were all very taken aback, as our group was being very polite, offering to help him, tipped well, were smiling, etc. He would NOT smile at us, so much so that it was like he was trying not to. He also made several incredibly slight and sarcastic comments and might have even been the manager, as he wasn't in a server outfit. It was a frustrating experience, as I know this spot is high quality and has a good reputation, but I was just sad that it tainted my friend's birthday a bit.",

The salsa was rather unremarkable and sadly rather bland; while the bean dip was rather bean tasting.  My combo plate with a taco, burrito and enchilada all pretty much tasted interchangeably the same and uniformly bland.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that good either and just was an overall very bland meal experience.  I probably will not return as the food just lacked in the flavor department.",

But the people that work there are nice, and the mani/pedi I got (shellac manicure) was good. Solid job. \n\nCons? They didn't have some of the brands of nail polish that I'm used to seeing at nail salons now. They had A LOT of colors and brands, but it was almost too many? I kind of panicked and just picked a color! And it wasn't expensive, but it wasn't cheap either. \n\nThey did a good job on my nails - especially on the manicure! A very good job. I'd definitely go back, but next time I need to think about what colors I want first (or take my own polish with me)!",

From service to ambiance to menu, it was nothing short of exceptional, and easy to see why this place has been internationally renowned for decades. Our team was seated in a back private dining area where we were delighted and dazzled us with humor, history and experience. Lorenzo was hardly a waiter, but more of a showman. We jokingly referred to him as the \"most interesting man in the world\" the entire evening, once learning that he had lived on over 3 different continents (Africa, Europe, NA), multilingual, and was raised in Paris but is of Italian and Cajun decent. The gracious owner also was on site and took time to pop in, and share her Texas (Dallas) ties with us. \n\n\nFood- EXCELLENT. There are over 2K reviews of this place, so here's another one telling you to try the turtle soup. Sounds gross, but tastes delicious.

  "text": "I always have a love/hate relationship with zoos. While I love seeing the animals, my heart does break a tiny bit knowing that this really isn't their natural habit and they're totally stuck in the cage for my benefit only, which really is kind of a bummer. But then if I don't go and see them, then they are sitting in there for nothing, right? It's lose/lose, but I go for a bit, try not to feel badly about it, and donate to the zoo when I can.\n\nWhile in St. Louis I did stop by the zoo to check it out. The main reason? It was free. Who doesn't love a little free-ninety nine in their life? I know I do. First thing I thought was, \"wow, this place is freaking enormous\". Definitely grab a map because at first I didn't and found myself completely overwhelmed by the shear mass of this place.\n\nThe zoo host about 16,000 animals- that's a freaking lot. It's on a 90 acre lot and features over 600 species  of animals. From rare and even endangered and even my friends the sting rays. They have so much to look at! The zoo features animals like the Tasmanian Devil, yes, just like the cartoon, but without all the fun. It's got all of your favorites and more.\n\nMy one note is to be careful when the sun is out- it gets crazy hot here. Thank goodness they have those big mister fans. Think of those fans Beyoncé uses on her stage, but misting you with water. You're going to want to stand in front of one for a few seconds, or even a minute because the sun in the Lou can be a scorcher.\n\nPrices on bottled water will run you $3-$4, but when it's hot like it was when I was there, it's totally worth every penny, plus, you didn't pay admission!\n\nFor me, it's a great place to do a nice loop. See what you can see and leave. Go say hi to some animals and keep it moving.",

In addition, I was excited to finally try some pastries as well. #proudfatkid \n\nThe restaurant itself was pretty busy/active (but in a productive way as people were leaving and coming in) but the nicely shaded patio only had one occupied table. Being as we had our dog, we sat outside comfortably at a shaded table by the door. Perfect for our September evening prior to hitting the park so we could all get some exercise in ;) \n\nService was efficient and cordial and our dog was treated to a styrofoam water bowl. I appreciated that they accommodated our pooch. \n\nWe both had bowls of pho with rare meat on the side. The bowls came with a nice amount of garnish and a good presentation of meat, had a nice clean broth and were a hearty size--almost too much to eat in one sitting if you haven't eaten all day (like myself). I managed to do just fine. At $8, I feel this is a great value. I utilized some chili sauce and sriacha that were provided to me upon request. Yum! \n\nI attempted to order the special of the day that I saw on Instagram (if you're a user FOLLOW THEM to see daily specials and some serious food porn), but, wouldn't you know, and like it was suggested, they were sold out. I cried a little inside; IG rep wasn't kidding when we were encouraged to get it while it lasts. The crabmeat and shrimp toast looked divine and I'm sad that I missed it. Because I was in the mood for tofu, I got four pieces of their flavored house made tofu ($1 total) from the food bar to sample at the table. I really enjoyed the mushroom tofu and the lemongrass tofu very much; it was unlike anything I ever had and the tofu was inflected with vegetables and seasonings. \n\nOf course we had to get our favorite avocado boba to split. That was the icing on the cake.  A few pastries and treats from the food bar later and waddling away with a full belly it was a wrap. I wish I could say that I ate their dessert tofu with a delightful ginger sugar syrup but I was sooo full. I will dream about the next time I can visit.

For a review of their shakes, I refer you to the review I did prior to this update.\n\nOverall, a boring sort of burger and our lowest scoring one thus far (2.17 average star rating from participants).  Their fries did nothing to redeem this joint or their unimaginative interpretation of American fast food.  Even one of the participants who gave them higher than the average score (3 star) later notated on her scorecard \"error!  must have been in a good mood!\"  as in hindsight she felt she had been too generous.  \n\nWhat we hated:  The fries.  The freshness (or lack thereof) of ingredients.  The overall quality.\n\nWhat they have going for them:  They've been here for many years and that must account for something.  Their location is prime on the corner of 36th and State--a great location for grab and go for those returning from work to their home in the foothills or Northend.  They have a drive thru.  And, though they don't have indoor seating, they do have outdoor (limited) seating.\n\nOverall, with so many other burger places nearby, I would probably drive the extra 1/2 mile for something a little fresher and memorable.",

At the ripe ol' age of twenty five, I have finally made my first trip to Humpin' Hannah's. I remember moving to Boise seven years ago, driving past this place and thinking to myself, \"Nothing good could happen at a bar with that name.\" LOL. \n\nDon't let the name or bras hanging from the ceiling fool you, friends. This place possesses a peculiar class of it's own. Sure, its class doesn't look like a perfectly clean interior, modern design, or fancy glass-wear. But it looks like the bouncers smiling at you and telling you to have a good time when you walk in, music being played that reminds you of your childhood, and the fact the dance floor is occupied by people of all ages and from all walks of life.\n\nRight when you walk in, there is a little bar set up to the left of the front door that offers $1 shots and $2 PBRs. The shots are served in those little test tube looking things. (This made me think of that scene from Miss Congeniality, so I had no choice but to try one hehe.) The shot was yummy and tasted like liquid candy more than anything. After trying one of these, my friends and I indulged in a \"Purple Viking\". This was good-ish, but not my fave. The mix of grape and vodka made it taste like cough syrup, IMO. \n\nTowards the back of the venue, they have a dance floor with a live band playing music (see my review for Simple Ruckus). When the band took a break, music was played over the loud speakers with accompanying videos projected on the back screen of the stage. This is probably my favorite place I've gone dancing in Boise! The music is fun, and people (for the most part) keep it classy in here and respect your personal space.\n\nIn addition to a fun dance floor and fun vibe, they have pool tables and lots of places to sit, sip on a drink, and enjoy conversation.",

Right now for happy hour, they do a dollar off their house special cocktails, rail liquor, and Logboat cans. Beyond that, they have an awesome draft list and a bunch of other domestic and local beer options. \n\nThe music is always fun and on point, just like it should be at a neighborhood bar.

  "text": "While their are definitely some glaring flaws to Spruce Harbor Park during its first summer of execution, especially in the Blue Anchor pop up portion, Its pretty hard NOT to give five stars for the way that they transformed a simple Philly pier into a remarkable boardwalk wonderland filled with plenty of games, outdoor lighting effects, beer gardens, and an endless amount of hammocks.\n\nBetween Hyatt hotel and the dreadful eyesore that is the Christopher Columbus Memorial, this park resides in the area that was hands down my least favorite area of the waterfront. But in just a short amount of time Spruce Harbor has managed to become the perfect example of Philly Parklife during the summertime. After all, its not everyday that you can find outdoor games like bocce ball and shuffleboard, classic and new school videogames, and giant sets of chess and Jenga all in one park. While it can be a shit show with a long line and a burger that leaves a lot to be desired, it does speak miles that they brought in an Iron Chef like Jose Garces to set up shop on the parks first restaurant/beer garden pop up too.\n\nToss in the the many hammocks (one day I will find the opportunity to chillax and read in one), giant With Love Philly Chair, random lighting effects, and more that you may encounter in a visit, and its no wonder why this park may even succeed at being more of a people watching destination than Rittenhouse Square!",

  "text": "I don't know if I'm being stingy or if all this economy business has me paying more attention to financial matters, but lately I'm feeling like quality is declining and yet prices are crazy high!\n\nHang on.  Wait just a minute.  I think my micro and macro economics professors just got their wings!  Finally, five-plus years later, I get it!  \n\nJoking aside, 2007's Best of Philly happy hour winner leaves A LOT to be desired.  They boast $5 wines by the glass-- but that's only for two selections, one red and one white.  The Cabernet they had on special was pretty beat, and since we didn't want to take a chance on the white, my friend and I ordered a bottle of chardonnay off the regular menu that was actually really good.\n\nAfter a couple drinks, we ordered the tomato & mozzarella pizza and a wedge salad to share.  The pizza was good for sure but there was no substance.  A saltine is thicker than the crust used in this pizza, no joke.  As for the wedge salad?  I had to ask the bartender if he brought the right one-- it was a hunk of iceberg with some really random vegetables leaned up against it, and an unidentifiable gray substance on the side.  When the bartender confirmed that this was indeed the wedge salad, I asked where the Gorgonzola came in-- oh the gray stuff, of course!  The menu didn't mention that it would be presented in a baby poop-inspired way so that's probably why I didn't realize.  My bad!  \n\nRae is a cool-looking spot for sure, but I think they take advantage of the fact that they are the only real restaurant in the 30th Street Station/Cira Centre vicinity.  They miss the mark on \"creative, complex and imaginative\" because they try too hard to get overly fancy, which is just annoying and unnecessary (much like the 5 star reviews that are clearly written by Rae staff).  I can see why it's a popular spot, and the complimentary valet is definitely a bonus, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to grab a drink or bite to eat there again.",

  "text": "Wonderful ginger chocolate cookie. \n\nI feel bad when someone asks what do you suggest and then goes rogue and doesn't listen. I feel like I usually ask what do you suggest in hopes that they will suggest something I was eyeing. I had just eaten an acai bowl at The Blind Tiger next door so I wasn't looking for something big. I jumped on it when the employee suggested the ginger chocolate cookie. It sounded delicious and I wouldn't pack on a million calories. \n\nThis review is based solely on that cookie. They had a variety of other sweets and savory options - like savory stuffed croissants. As I was munching on the cookie, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I thought, well yes I like this cookie, but you can't really screw it up. Then I thought back to the many times I had that thought with something that a business had screwed up. Moral of the story is I'm not taking this cookie for granted and it's good to know they make one well. \n\nThe ginger chocolate cookie is chewy with huge chunks of chocolate. I felt like $2.50 is fair for this cookie's size. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth and you're looking for a cute bakery to appease it, swing by here. I'm a fan.",

But we did manage to get a table for eight with no problem and no wait!\n\nAfter browsing the menu, I decided to go with the McGrittl This - an enormous pancake with cheese eggs and sausage topped off with another enormous pancake. The pancakes had the perfect fluffy texture - as did the eggs! However, the eggs, cheese and sausage weren't quite as flavorful as I wanted them to be. I would mostly blame the cheese - it was American. If I'd known, I probably would've asked for pepper jack or something else instead. I'd say that this dish is an awesome idea and gets major creativity points, but the execution could be improved. And that's the main reason I'm giving a 3/5.",

The room decor looked like it came from an 1850s mining town brothel - the print and flounciness and overall blinding colors made me want to throw up.  I must not have been in a recently renovated room because everything was just outdated and tacky.\n\nThe quality of the bedcovers and sheets was all cheap, polyestery and smooth and shiny (and not the sexy, satiny kind of smooth and shiny, either).  \n\nMy parents were in a room down the hall, and even though it was a non-smoking room, it smelled stale and stuffy in there, as if someone had just sneaked a cigarette in recently.  There was a problem with the toilet not flushing correctly, and it took a loooooong time for someone to come up and fix it, despite being told someone would be up \"shortly.\"  Define shortly?  Thirty minutes?  An hour?  Try two hours.\n\nNo thanks - there are lots of different hotel options in this town (and really, I only stay in Reno hotels if I have out of town guests who have an early morning flight the next day - or if I have a morning flight myself), and I won't be back to this hotel any time soon.",

The small corner restaurant is decorated in a casual French Provencal style, with exposed wine racks, warm wood and giant Toulouse Lautrec prints.  It's not very original, aesthetically, but not too shabby for the suburbs. \n\nThe food is the thing that keeps my Media relations coming back -- brunch is especially nice, with a range of breakfast-y egg dishes, generously filled crepes, salads, even a hearty burger.  I especially liked my La Savoyarde crepe filled with raclette cheese (medium-hard Swiss cow's milk), roasted potatoes, prosciutto and reduced leek sauce. It was a bit salty -- the prosciutto, I'd wager -- but I'm into that. \n\nService is charming and attentive; the staff even remembers that my parents drink Diet Coke and club soda and serve it to them as soon as they sit down!  \n\nA lovely neighborhood restaurant that always delivers a tasty meal.",

If for some reason I had to, it would probably break my heart. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.\n\nYesterday, was St. Joseph's Day and when fellow yelper, Lindsay A and I were talking about dinner, we didn't know what we wanted but we knew we wanted dessert here. We wandered in (and there wasn't too much of a line!) and ordered mocha gelato and a blood orange ice plus we each got the special for San Giuseppe Sfinge, which was puff pastry with cannoli cream with a cherry and candied orange. So much goodness. We got to check out their altar (which is much smaller these days than I remember it in the 80s) and enjoy all the passersby.\n\nAt Jazz Fest, Brocato's has a booth at Food 1 and sells spumoni and few other items so I always try to stop by. Back when I was a little girl and fest was MUCH less crowded, I was allowed to cross the fairgrounds by myself to buy myself a wedge (for $1) and then I would gobble it up as I walked back so I wouldn't have to share it with my brothers. \n\nIn my family, the mango ice is one of the first real people foods that new babies are allowed to eat, ensuring that their taste buds are set for life. \n\nWhen they reopened after K, I cried and cried because I was so happy they were back.

Chips, which are NOT gratis, were stale, ice cold and  \"flat \". The salsa was tasteless there seemed to be absence of flavor in everything we ordered. I'd the beef el pastor burrito bowl. Meh, it was very rice centric! Pineapple Margaritas were too sweet - there was no pineapple flavor evident just sour mix. \n\nHere's the kicker our server added a 20% tip (for a party of 2)  but didn't tell us and there's no warning on the menu. When we asked him why he didn't tell us (after we left an additional 25% tip before realizing what he did) he said it was because of \"dine and dashers\". If someone is going to run out on the check they will also run out on the tip! So that's just not a cogent explanation! Frankly, i could see why you wouldnt want to tip there but dining and dashing is theft. Ironically we were the ones  left feeling ripped off for sure. Since it was my first meal out in 17 months I didn't want to deal with confronting the server but I'll never go back there again. \n\nThe overall experience was unpleasant. I have a hard time leaving less than 3 stars on any review but I won't be recommending this location. Evidently there are several in the area. \n\nSo, after all that we discovered it's a crappy chain joint to boot!",

  "text": "Dr. Sandilands is killing it, and of course, my hygienist, Soraya. They're always so pleasant! Today I went in and was told that I looked like the Princess of Spain! I mean who can resist the charm?\n\nDue to financial/coverage constraints, I wasn't really able to afford going to the Dentist for about two years. It sucks but thankfully my teeth hadn't seen too much damage from the lack of dental care. I was really excited to go today and finally care for my teeth! Now that I have a bit of financial freedom, I'm just stoked to be able to sort everything out.\n\nWhen I go there I feel well cared for. This includes the nice woman at reception, who got me in the day after I called for an appointment. \n\nI also didn't feel judged for not being able to come in for a while. This was great because I was a bit worried.\n\nThis is also a dental practice filled with badass women! That is always a plus for me. I made the change to all women health practitioners a few years ago and I'm very glad I did! If you're looking for a woman to take care of you, this is the place to go!\n\nThanks for the awesome care to everyone at Whitemud Dental.",

I tried out the Goose Island Urban Pale Ale with the short rib cheese fries (loved both!)..and then this band started to set up right behind us. Sure, you couldn't really continue any conversation at this point, but the band was awesome.\n\nAlways a fun time at the Pour House.",

  "text": "Customizable cheesesteak? Grilled onions? Where do you think you are? Burger King? In-N-Out? Starbucks? I told my cousin to not be the annoying tourist. My bad, after reading the reviews and listening to him order, apparently you can have it your way. Just tell the guy what you want. \n\nI just got a cheesesteak provolone. I'm not too keen on cheesesteaks and wanted to keep it basic. I should have added onions to mine because it was bland. We added salt and pepper to our sandwiches. The meat was chopped up this time (yay!) and not at all greasy (surprisingly). The bread was real good, soft and doughy. I liked the vibe at Jim's. It felt local as opposed to Pat's and Geno's which is like standing in line at a theme park or carnival. \n\nJim's sandwiches are far better than Pat's and Geno's but still not what I thought cheesesteaks were gonna be like. As Mari H explains, maybe I just don't 'get it' yet. I also highly doubt my tastebuds are more refined than hers. After all, I am a Steak-umm kinda gal. So with that said, perhaps the city of Philly has more refined tastebuds than me.\n\nAnd like a cheesesteak whore, I'm on to the next one. Hello Tony Luke!\n\nPS- There is plenty of seating upstairs but they don't let you loiter.",

  "text": "Short and sweet review for my short experience.\n\nOne mission: two muzzles for my two dogs that will not get along no matter how.darned.hard.we.try.  I pulled up the Yelp app to find the nearest PetSmart and voila, this location saved the day for my quick mission. I enjoyed seeing more than three dogs roaming with their owners in the store during the five minutes I was there. The space was fairly organized and parking was easy. It also doesn't hurt that they have a craft store next door. \n\nThis location also offers grooming services as well as puppy school and continued training.",

  "text": "I love this place. Trying to be healthier but not completely depriving myself, I usually order the Chinese chicken salad (with dressing on the side, of course) and my friends and I would order the lobster mac & cheese and share that.  The mac&cheese is a must for me everytime I come. The \"mac\" part is actually orzo pasta which makes it a little unique. The top also has crunchy bits (which I think are bread crumbs) that just adds a whole other textural element to the dish. \n\nRegardless of what you order, get the mac&cheese and share with your group!! You won't  be disappointed.\n\nTry to come early because the wait does get long!",

  "text": "I appreciate Reno Bites Week- it reminds you of great spots that you sometimes forget to return to.  \n\nI have hosted a Esteban HH here and have enjoyed a few special food events here over the last couple of years. I need to return more often to the downtown restaurant. \n\nDuring RBW the chef offered a three course pre fixe for $30. A full sized small chopped kale salad dressed with a bright lemony vinaigrette with roasted beets and crumbled goat cheese. A similar salad is on the regular- highly suggest you try it. The main course was a seared duck breast with cubes of roasted squash and a cornbread crumble. The overall flavors and texture of this plate shouted- \"bring on the fall weather\". I really loved the perfectly cooked squash cubes, but crunchiness of the cornbread crumble- scarecrows sang!!  Dessert was a surprise- not a slice of pie, but a small cute baby pumpkin pie on a stick. Perfect for me because I'm all about the flaky crust anyway. It was accompanied by a scoop of bourbon ice cream and a caramel drizzle. This meal included a glass of J Lohr Pinot Noir.  \n\nThey create a wonderful charcuterie and cheese plate to snack on with wine or cocktails for light dinner plans. \n\nOur service was good. Not rushed thru our meal even as the tables filled up fast. \nSitting along the full windows is a combination- there are shades to block the full afternoon sun, they will open for fresh fall air, and the walkers by can be very entertaining.  \n\nRemember to get your parking stub from across the street validated. Although I find it easier to park across the river at the courthouse parking lot for free.",
