  "text": "Got a to-go order on a very cold Sunday afternoon in March. I ordered a Hot N Sour Soup, a 4pc Crab Rangoon, and the House Special (Beef, Pork, Chicken, & Shrimp) Lo Mein. The Hot N Sour Soup and the Crab Rangoon were both adequate and typical of any strip mall carryout Chinese place. The Lo Mein was probably the worst I've ever had. The noodles were overcooked and tasteless. The beef was stringy. The pork appeared to be reddish in an alarmingly undercooked way. I took literally two bites of this and threw it away. I would never go back.",

Lol) was Drago's.  He proclaimed they had the best charbroiled oysters, and he told no lies.  The piping hot oysters arrived at the table crusted with Parmesan cheese on top, and swimming in butter.  I grabbed a piece of French bread, gave my best somersault tuck, and dove in!  So rich and flavorful, just sublime.  The spinach dip was tasty as well, but the oysters are a must.",

It's nice to eat at the restaurant (staff very friendly and very child friendly) and also good for takeout. So far I've had nothing bad on the menu (3 cup chicken, scallion pancakes and fried rice very good). Looking forward to trying a whole fish next time I dine in.",

Can't say that it tastes anything like the real thing, but who cares. I have been won over by its artificially colored and unidentified flavor.\n\nI learned my lesson last time and didn't load up with toppings which seem to be what tips the scale in the price department, especially the fruit which makes sense. My husband being the \"frugal\" person he is likes to load up on the plain tart and take it to go... once at home he adds his own toppings. \n\nAs an added bonus we took my mother-in-law on a Monday and she got a $1 off her order. They have other great specials for teachers and active duty military, police, etc. You gotta respect local businesses who take care of their locals!",

I noticed outside there are a lot of Hornets. please be careful you don't get  stung buy one. macaroni and Grill needs to get some kind of an exterminator out to get rid of them. \n\nWhen I walked in I had reservations. And was seated asap, but it was not that packed so I can only guess that maybe I really didn't need to make reservations. but it was Mother's Day so you would expect them to be packed. Better to be safe then sorry. \n\nAfter seated, was asked what we would like to drink. I got there peach iced tea. which is very good. And they brought the good bread and oil on a plate to dip the bread in for a little snack. So so good. \n\n I wound up ordering the buffalo chicken parmesan with spaghetti with blue cheese and celery mixed in the spaghetti, yes and it was good. The sauce on the chicken parm had a little kick to it. just how I like it. And got a Caesar salad on the side for an extra $2.99. but the Caesar salad was small. Could have gave me a bigger salad, it's not your typical salad. most places that's much bigger and most of the lettuce in the salad Was chunks on the bottom. \n\nOverall everything was good. except the service could have been a little bit better. especially at the time I was there it was not that busy.",

I have to give this place a thumbs up for forcing us to always buy 2 scoops and for making super creative flavors. The churro was excellent! Very strong cinnamon taste, kind of like horchata. The strawberry was pretty standard. The ice cream is just okay for me. The texture is not thick and creamy like cowabunga creamery or jp licks. The variety of flavors is nice but that's pretty much the novelty of this place.",

  "text": "OK - let me say I love El Vez, and have been a fan since they converted it over from Pasion years back. Unfortunately, this old lady is starting to show her grey hair and really needs some retooling. \n\nBlood Orange margaritas have been the sad draw here forever. Heck even Copa has like a dozen these days, how about rotating a few new flavors. Great on the new Guacamole selections, but it shouldn't have been at the expense of the salsa. Manchego still rules, but the cactus and crab is way too oily, and the citrus tuna one was unavailable last time I was in (seriously - unavailable? someone forgot to shop?) \n\nThe other downturn is with the fajitas. The old presentation sent them out to the table steaming and sputtering. A lot of show? Of course, but that smell. I'd order them and in five minutes three others would too. These day's they're tasty, but the mystique of that lovely sizzli smoke is nowhere to be found. \n\nYeah, they have lots of tequila. Yay. I'm a Negro Modela man myself, so I'm content there. Black bass taco's and Mahi-Mahi tacos shouldn't be missed - simply delicious. \n\nBut not a lot to rave about. It's the same old concept with retreaded salsa, and not a whole bunch like they used to have, with a few new guacamole's. I agree if it's broke don't fix it, but come on guys - you're a Starr joint, run some seasonal offerings through or some new specials or something. You're food's good, we're just bored with the same old dishes! \n\nAnd telling us you can't get the sizzling grills is just absurd. I can google them up on the net in about 4.3 seconds - spend some cash and get the right ones back in!",

The server was somewhat attentive for our large party, but it took forever to get our dinner. \n\nMeanwhile, A storm was starting to come in with dark clouds and the winds picked up. The staff was very aware and were ready to move us if we needed it. Fortunately, we did not have to move. We finally got our dinner. Most of us were OK with what they ordered, but were so hungry by that time. We just ate. \n\nI ordered the Seafood Trio appetizer. The plate consisted of (3) blackened scallops with a reduction sauce, a scoop of fish bread, and two shrimp with cocktail sauce. First were the shrimp .... Just OK... Not hard to mess up (2) boiled shrimp, but the cocktail sauce was prepackaged. Second, the fish bread was OK, I've definitely had better. I asked to substitute cucumbers slices, instead of crackers. Lastly, were the scallops... They were supposed to be blackened with some type of reduction sauce. The seasoning was so salty, it was not good. By that point, we had waited so long, I knew it would take forever if I sent it back. I drank a ton of water because it was so salty. No one ever asked if the food was ok. Unfortunately, would not recommend.",

One day, I ordered this as I was eating in the restaurant and I felt sad we didn't have enough for leftovers the next day, SO I WENT BACK and got another order the next day! Mind you, I live thirty minutes away. That alone should speak to the deliciousness of these Peking Style Pork Chops. \n\nOther things that I've ordered that are delicious: the house tofu, the seafood tofu claypot, the Singapore Chow Mein, the Walnut Shrimp, and the Blackened Steak. Almost all the veg options are great too- pretty standard sautéed Chinese vegetables. \n\nDishes to pass on: anything with their duck, the noodle soups, and sautéed string beans. The sautéed string beans are sometimes are miss because the string beans are old, causing the dish to be less than ideal. I'm pretty sure they don't have a legit roaster because their duck is always lacking, no matter if it's in the duck noodle soup or the plain roasted duck. Hard pass. The noodle soups are fine, but rather lackluster. If you're seriously craving, go ahead, but I hope you won't be disappointed like I was! \n\nNote that this is a Mandarin-speaking Chinese establishment, meaning that a lot of the dishes like wonton noodle soup (HK most well-known for this) will not be as tasty. That said, I always leave Little Chinatown satisfied. It's absolutely worth the thirty minute drive!",

I also really wanted drunken noodles - the wide flat noodles, in which the other establish does not have. \n\nPros:\n1) Interior is more traditional and surprisingly pretty nice inside.\n2) Won like a best STL Thai award in 2014!!\n3) Drunken noodles is spot on and not greasy\n\nCons:\n1) Tom Yum Soup. It's good, but it's has a lot of fish sauce. If you are not use to heavy fish sauce and a red Tom Yum with a more sour than sweet. This won't be for you. I prefer my Tom Yum from around the corner.\n2) Pricing is slightly (but only very slightly more expensive than the others)\n\nHowever, I am a believer that there are other amazing thai options in the area. I will def. eat in here and take advantage of the full menu next time!",

Located in Clearwater Beach at the brand new Wyndham Hotel, the restaurant is a must for any special occasion, or if you are just in a mood for great food. We came on a Saturday evening, hoping that we wouldn't need to wait that long. To our surprise, there was no wait. We were greeted by our hostess who sat us down immediately . I have to mention that every seat in this restaurant had a great view so you won't be disappointed in where you sit.  Our waitress promptly greeted us and asked us for our drink orders, she also gave us the specials. What I enjoyed was that she actually gave the price of each individual dish. \nNow, to the food. We decided to order two sushi rolls and the Chinese meatballs. We got the Yamada and Hai Roll. The Yamada had yellowfin tuna on top and in the roll it had a stone crab. The roll had lemon zest in it and it was paired off with a lemon mayo. The Hai Roll was my favorite, it was a lobster salad roll and it was topped with beef carpaccio and truffles. Yes, I said truffles. The only thing that was disappointing was that I had to share it.  The meatballs were your basic pork meatballs, kicked up a notch with a hoisin sauce and Serrano peppers. Yum! \nEverything was wonderful and I can't wait to go back and try the thai mussels and the pork tenderloin.",

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick bite around the Carmel area.  The line tends to be long but they move people very quickly as they are very efficient in creating your meal.\n\n\nThink Chipotle, Moe's or Qdoba but with Italian food.  \n\n\nPiada - Think burrito\nNoodle bowl - Think rice bowl\nSalad Bowl - Think...umm salad bowl\n\nThey have a few side items you can order as well to accent your meal such as a Piada Stick which is basically a Piada wrap covered in oil and heated up with cheese on it until it melts.  It is as delicious and unhealthy as it sounds.  I think ONE of the sicks comes in at a whopping 500 calories.  Absurd.\n\n\nYou choose your meat which are delicious but very high in calories unfortunately.  (I believe they cook things in massive oil)\n\nYou follow that up with veggies. (Soooo many choices, make sure to get pancetta)\n\nYou follow that up with a sauce or dressing (depending on salad or piada/pasta)\n\nYou then pay at the other end of the counter and off you go.  Fast Casual as it is meant to be.\n\nI can't give this place 5 stars as I reserve that for places that blow my socks off, and I am not quite happy with the calorie counts at this place but I fully like this place enough to work it into my lunch rotation.",

At this point, I won't try a spa service without a Groupon or LivingSocial deal because they are so hit or miss on spa treatments in Indy.\n\nI liked my hot stone massage, but it was different than I have been used to.  That isn't bad...just different and the jury is still out on whether or not I really liked it.  \n\nKind of an odd set up.  The massage rooms were downstairs and you can hear people walking around upstairs...not entirely restul, but that wasn't a deal breaker.  The hot stones appeared to be out in the hallway because my massage therapist kept leaving the room to get more hot stones.  \n\nAt some points, I had to ask her to go a little easy with them since I didn't want 2nd and 3rd degree burns...I have no idea how she could hold onto them!  I usually like all things hot, but these were almost too hot.  But she was careful to listen to me and adjusted the amount of exposure to my skin.\n\nThe entire hour was spent face down...which was different and no massage at all of my arms...which was odd.  Again, the jury's out on whether or not this was a good massage for me.\n\nI do plan on coming back for their one hour foot reflexology for $29...a good run for Foot Finesse's money since I refuse to go back to Foot Finesse because of their practice of ignoring appointments.\n\nI like that Pastel Spa is walkable from my home...but after an hour of hedonism...I'm not sure I want to walk home :-)\n\nI'll be back...and hope to upgrade them a star or two.",

The name of the place didn't entice me, but the outdoor seating was something that I wanted to experience so we dropped in. \n\nI ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was actually HUGE and delicious. For 10, you really can't go wrong with this beach eat. My companions had the BLT salad and she-crab soup and an order of king crab legs. I tried the crab legs and they were excellent. \n\nThe one snafu of our time at Cooter's was a visit from \"Rufus\" and a few of his friends (i.e., a large Florida roach). I get that it's outside, in Florida, after a rainstorm, but when one of these guys starts crawling up your leg it makes for a it of creepy crawly feeling for the rest of the evening. The wait staff was kind enough to help us shoo them away from our table so I am assuming that this experience is commonplace. \n\nAfter dinner we retreated to the sports bar area to have a happy hour drink. 3 drinks for under 7 dollars was perfect for us. Highly recommend the happy hour in what is surely the Pittsburgh Steelers bar of Clearwater, FL.",

I had been driving by Kansai for months since we moved to the area, but never got the opportunity to stop in. They have a well rounded menu of rolls, entrees, dinner boxes and appetizers. the prices are spot on with any other sushi place you'd go. We ordered the gyoza ($6), a Philly roll ($6), and two Godzilla rolls. ($11 each). The Godzilla roll was very good, it was filled with fresh tasting tuna, crab, avocado, deep fried, then covered in roe and spicy mayo. It came with 8 large pieces, very good rool. The Philly roll was done right, they didn't skimp on the fish which is nice. the gyoza were also good, albeit cold by the time they arrived. Next time, I may give one of tghe dinner boxes or an entree a try. Overall, solid spot for japanese/sushi in the area, and bonus they deliver!",

A = bad in the world of authentic chinese dining). something about the cantonese/mandarin chattering all around me is very comforting.\n\nin the grand scheme of dim sum restaurants, the prices here are kind of expensive. still cheap.. just.. more expensive than most. wait times during weekend lunch hours can take up to an hour, but that's pretty standard for any dim sum restaurant. if you wanna avoid the rush, go before 11am. \n\nservice is so-so, but that's also standard of most chinese restaurants. in fact, it could be much worse. at the end of the meal, you have to take your stamp card up to the cashier desk yourself and pay. kind of atypical, but much faster than waiting for shoddy service to ring up your bill and bring it to your table.",

Every company wanted to charge me an arm and a leg for the long distance move even though I did not have much to move with me. This company was the only moving company I trusted after talking to many. \n\nNate, the owner of Smooth Moving Pros, was very prompt with answering any questions I had and even offered me a discount for my move since I did not have much stuff! \n\nThey came on time and even brought along coverings for all my mattresses, mirrors, and paintings which they took the time to put on for me. Needless to say, this has been the quickest and most efficient move ever! Everything was packed into the van in less than an hour, they drove to DC quickly, and unloaded everything within less than an hour. I did not have to worry about gas, toll, etc. because everything was covered with a flat, reasonable rate for my long distance move. \n\nI paid less for my long distance move from Philly to DC than I did when I moved 5 blocks away in Philly with another moving company! Please use them, they are amazing and I HIGHLY would recommend Smooth Moving Pros to anyone looking to move. \n\nThank you again guys!",

It is causing a serious interruption in my daily functioning.\n\nSometimes I will be in the middle of a conversation and I will pretend to get a call so that I can go outside, hail a cab, and go to Desi Chaat house for the samosas.  I return, sometimes an hour later, and attempt to continue the conversation as if nothing had happened.  My friends think I'm on drugs and my girlfriend is accusing me of having an affair but they don't know how much I love these samosas.\n\nBut Brad, why not introduce these people to Desi Chaat house?  \n\nThe answer is simple, hypothetical question-asker...it is because I am a man who's mind is rife with delusional paranoia.  I fear that my friends and loved ones, knowing my weakness, will buy out the samosas before I am able to get to the restaurant and they will sell them to me at ridiculous markups.  Like a hopeless addict, I will be enslaved to the wills of those I once trusted. \n\nIllogical? yes.  Impossible?  Nope.\n\n...ok back to reviewing.\n\nWhen you order them, they will offer to pour chickpeas over them.  Let them do this.  \n\nThe best way I could describe the chaat is...wacky.  It is a peculiar mix of sweet, spicy, creamy, and aromatics.  I've had the vegetable samosa and mumbai chaat and both are good.\n\nThe chicken roll and lamb roll make an excellent lunch.  The meat is tender and seasoned extremely well.  I highly recommend these items.  For a very vegetarian-leaning culture, India sure makes some excellent meat dishes.\n\nOn top of it all, the staff is ridiculously friendly and always asking for feedback on how they can improve.  It is tasty, inexpensive, unique, and has the best veggie samosas in Philadelphia.\n\nNote: I like veggie samosas a lot more than most people so bear that in mind when you consider this review.",

The kids meal consisted of a small version of their regular burger, fries, and a small drink. The meal was a nice size. I didn't get a shake but some of the flavors really intrigued me. I may go back for a shake but not for a burger.",

  "text": "I just went here because I had coupons, and it was convenient on my route.  Well, and I admit I'm a Yelp addict, so part of the reason was to Yelp about it, and get another cool-point for being the first to review this place.\n\nCleanliness is decent, cleaner than average.   But I did go right before the lunch rush.\n\nMy Whoppers (2-fer!) were pretty good for a Whopper.  The burgers are pre-cooked, but the sandwich is assembled to order, so all the ingredients are fresh, not wilted and squished (like McDonald's often is, if you get a standard pre-made/pre-assembled sandwich that sits around for up to 15 or 30 minutes.)\n\nThe men's room was decent.  I've seen better, but it meets my expectations for a Burger King franchise.\n\nThey have free Wi-fi.  You don't have to give them your email address, but you do have to click through an \"I ACCEPT\" (terms of use) screen.   Unfortunately, the Wi-fi Internet connection was so slow as to be useless.  It was like a dial-up in terms of speed.",

  "text": "Good food very near Bourbon Street and all of that fun, but there are concerns.\n\nFirst, they don't take reservations...  Our group size was nine, and so they would not seat us until our whole group was together.  This is important to know since Bourbon Street does have some.... distractions.  Once we finally had our whole group together it was another 30 minutes as we waited to be seated, and this was a Wednesday in the middle of summer.  I can't imagine the wait during prime time.\n\nSecond, the food is good, but it is mostly fried.  If you are not into fried food, you may not want to go here.  I hadn't had a Po'Boy yet, and so I let the waiter choose one for me, and he chose the 'soft shelled crab'.  This was my first soft shelled crab and it arrived fried in a batter on the Po'Boy bun with all the fixins.  I liked it.\n\nThird, it is air conditioned, and in July this is truly a blessing.  It was 98 outside and about 90% humidity.  It was a great relief to get inside.\n\nFourth, they do sell beer by the pitcher.  They had three on tap the night we were there, and we went with the Abita Amber.  It was good, cold, and short lived.\n\nFifth, they've got some signs that pay homage to those that have eaten 15 dozen oysters, and one guy who ate 51 dozen.  As I thought about this, I was struggled to imagine how this would go.  Do you start ordering them and then get into a rhythm and just continue?  What happens if you have seven and stop?  Can you take a break at about the 12th dozen?  Is there a time limit?  Is there a Monty Python film in the foreseeable future?\n\nGood food, good location, get your group together and enjoy.  Be sure to know that you'll need to wait outside, there are no reservations, and most of the items are fried.   I'll be back.",

And their presence overall has made water ice more popular in general.  I have no major problem with Rita's. \n\nBut honestly, I can name two water ice places in short driving distance that are better quality and less corporate, also far cheaper.  That's just fact. On top of that, the last water ice I got at Rita's was just a little too slushy for my taste.  \n\nBut, if someone handed me a Rita's water ice, I certainly wouldn't say no.",

  "text": "Ditch yo' family, ditch yo' friends, grab one person and hit up those tasty oysters at Acme!\n\nLong line out the door is the norm here. But if you have a small party of 1 or 2 you can sometimes get bumped to the front of the line (especially if it's just tourist groups of 3+ in front of you). \n\nBest oysters in my short time at NOLA. Don't waste your time with the raw, go for chargrilled. Outstanding seasoning and done to perfection. I'm sure the raw is good, but seriously - you won't regret just going all in with the chargrilled.\n\nMinor demerit for the \"sorry we can't make the mojito; the bartender says we're out of mint\" (which per my bartender friends is a common lie when they don't want to make mojitos). Either take the mojitos out of your menu completely or make sure you stock enough mint. Given how established this place is, I find it hard to believe they can run out of mint so early in the evening (before 6:30 pm). But whatever. It's not like I would boycott them since they have me by their oysters and fantastic po'boys.\n\nWish I was staying in NOLA longer, would've gone here twice.",

  "text": "I came here yesterday with a group of 6 for one of our friend's birthday. We had a reservation so we had no problem getting seated. This is a new place, and the service was good! The restaurant itself is nice and roomy. I've been to other gyu-kaku locations, and this one has a lot more light and space as compared to the other one I've been to (in Cupertino, CA). We ordered the $180 combo meal for 6 people, which proved to be more than enough food for all of us. Ordered a pitcher of beer too! It came with a lot of items, but I'd say my favorites were the hot oil seared tuna, the sea bass, and the kobe beef items! the bibimbap to start off with was really good as well. Overall, this was a good dinner at a place that just recently opened. After a few tweaks here and there, this place could potentially be a really big hot spot in Philly considering there aren't many Japanese bbq places around.",

  "text": "Not a bad Mexican food joint in my opinion but I have had better closer to me. \nThe restaurant is very cute, I like the big arm chairs that you sit in at the tables. Everyone is very friendly and the glass ceiling is rather unique so overall the atmosphere is quite pleasant.\n\nWe were brought chips and salsa almost immediately and like another review said before, I was a little sad when I noticed that the chips were not hot, I like having fresh and HOT tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants too. The salsa was good but I enjoy one that is more chunky with lots of \"stuff\" in it like tomatoes and onions. This one is very smooth and it has a good flavor and a nice spice to it but I just prefer one with more substance.\nThe margaritas on the other hand were very tasty and one pitcher definitely went a long way! They had a great flavor and just the right amount of booze, I would definitely recommend getting these if you are coming to Bertha Miranda's.\n\nThe food was very good, I chose to get the \"Masterpiece\" plate which had a little bit of everything. A shredded beef enchilada, a chicken taco and a cheese chile relleno were my choices and they were all very good. The taco was by far my favorite item of the three, the shell was a freshly fried corn tortilla but it was still a little chewy and the chicken was perfectly moist and tender, very tasty. I would have liked a little more meat in the enchilada and the relleno was good but nothing to write home about.  \nThe beans and rice were also good, but not great. The rice was a little overcooked and sort of lumpy but it still had a nice flavor. The beans on the other hand were perfectly cooked yet also disappointingly bland. \nMy brother ordered a similar dish to mine but with a tamale instead of relleno. The tamale was very yummy and they say that they are handmade at the restaurant so I'm sure this is one of the better things on the menu. \nMy mom ordered the chicken mole which I think was probably one of the BEST things that any one of us ordered. It had a nice, rich sauce with a smoky yet subtly sweet flavor. The chicken was nice and moist and I was definitely having a little food envy after I tasted her dish.  \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back to this place if I was ever in the area and would recommend it to anyone that likes mole, it is very hard to find at most places and this restaurant really does a nice job with it. The tacos and tamales are also probably the best choices here, but everyone has their own tastes. \nWorth a try if you are in Reno. A very nice authentic Mexican restaurant in a rather small, unassuming building. Don't forget to check out the automotive museum right across the street too! Two great little finds that are just a stones throw from the more popular, touristy casino joints.",

  "text": "+/- THE FOOD\nThe food is just okay here and I have definitely been to better buffets in Reno. There wasn't any particular dish that stood out to me or left me wanting for more. They try to have a wide variety of foods of different cultures but it doesn't seem that legit to me. I saw in pictures that there would be a bunch of seafood but when I got there, there was only a big pile of shrimp for shrimp cocktails and small platter of crab legs (which were all empty.... no meat in them at all). The meats are okay but not impressive. I liked the bbq ribs the best and I was pretty disappointed with the prime rib. Their Asian section was a DIY noodle soup area which was not good. They have a lot of different bite-sized desserts but they all taste really weird. The only ok-tasting desserts was the sorbet. \n\n- THE WAIT\nThe wait is crazy here regardless of what day you come here. Be prepared to wait at least an hour even though this place isn't that good. They have a faster line for the members with higher reward cards.",

This makes Dunders far more tolerable than it was previously, and actually a great place to have a brew and a bite!\n\nThe advantage of the bierhaus-style tables means it's great for groups as well, and you can hear multiple conversations and jump back and forth between them. Plus they have every kind of mustard on the planet, so if that's your thing you'll be able to try all of them.\n\nThe crowd is everything from USF grad students to hipsters of both variety (ironic and non-ironic). But get there earlier if you want something more than a sandwich, as they shut a bunch of the kitchen down at 10pm, thus meaning you can't get your schnitzel fix after that hour. \n\nA pretty authentic kind of place that's beloved by it's loyal customers... and now I'm a much bigger fan than I was before!",

  "text": "The absolute best pizza in NOLA. When I'm visiting my family we usually opt for delivery for convenience. But last night we decided to dine in and enjoy the $3 happy hour. Where can you get a $3 glass of wine in any major metropolitan city?! The inside is so cozy and quaint. Pretty romantic if you ask me. No more than 10 tables but if you go early enough, right after 5pm, there is no wait. Their pies are nothing less than divine. Perfect amount of sauce to cheese ratio, great topping options and crispy crust that is perfect for dipping in sauce. Vegans can delight as there is plenty for you to eat! We went on a Wednesday so you buy a large or extra large pizza and you get one for $1. Are you kidding me? A specialty pizza for a buck! And you can dine in or carry out with this deal. It's incredibly. We normally get the chicken/ bacon ranch and meathead but because I'm not eating meat for lent we also added a Cajun shrimp. And wow, I'll never look back. I really recommend checking out the specials before you go because they vary every day and have something unique every day. I can't rave enough about everything here. I did sit right under a speaker in the corner and that would be the only thing I would do differently, otherwise PERFECT and consistent pizza! And now my new favorite dive in NOLA to dine in. Can't wait to try the pastas and wings.",

  "text": "Place was clean, and service was friendly and prompt.  We did the All You Can Eat (AYCE) menu.  You checkmark what you want on an order slip and turn it in.  You can do this multiple times until you've had your fill.  But be wary, they'll charge 15% for anything you do not eat.  This is meant to discourage you from ordering the entire menu and leaving most of it to waste.  I want to go back and 1) get more crab rangoon; 2) not get the salad (little too big for me); 3) order 1 sushi piece per person (don't assume it's a pair); 4) try some different rolls than last time other than spicy tuna (definitely getting that one again).\n\nCrab Rangoon (5/5) - Some of the better crab rangoon around; I would order more than one set of 2 pieces\nSalad (4/5) - Pretty big portion with the delicious ginger dressing - very good but a bit too much of it\nGyoza (3/5) - Texture and taste seemed same as any potsticker from a Chinese restaurant\nShumai (3/5) - Their version is done with shrimp (remember it's not quite like the Chinese dim sum shumai; the Japanese version is much smaller)\nYaki Chicken (4/5) - The chicken skewers are worth ordering\nSushi (4/5) - This is the seafood piece across the pillow of rice.  These tasted just fine but note that they are single pieces; if you want a piece for you and your date, you will need to order two of them.  At other similar AYCE sushi, marking \"1\" here means a set of 2 pieces, so make sure to clarify.\nBoston Roll (3/5) - Just OK, not outstanding in flavor but tasted fresh\nSpicy Tuna Roll (4/5) - They do a solid spicy tuna roll here\nAmerican Dream Roll (3/5) - This comes in 5 large pieces; there is some eel sauce but not a lot\nHoney Roll (3.5/5) - This is small and 6 pieces; it's ok, but I'd probably try something different next time",

However the spice and ingredients are there. With that said. Let me get into the experience. \n\nMitmita is actually meaning one of the Ethiopian Spice. It can be mixed and make many dish. I like the restaurant reflecting their true calling. The culture of food is use a piece of injera to pick up a bit of entree by hand and eat it. That is how it done to enjoy the different cuisine. \n\nWe have a group there can try different dishes. Injera is a crepe type sheet for pick up the food. The best dish is the Ye-doro Wat. This is a chicken dish with Ethiopian Ber-bere sauce. The sauce has so many ingredients. It is flavorful. We also order the  Kat Wat the chop beef with Ethiopian bbq sauce, Kitfo the lean beef is with the Mitmita sauce, Gored Gored the raw tenderloin beef with amaze sauce. Those are good dishes. \n\nAfterward we have Ethiopian coffee with ceremony incense to celebrate special occasions. It was a great celebration. On the appetizers, we have the chicken, veggies, and beef sambusa. Very tasty. We have good time there.",

Our waitress was inattentive and just bad.\nLovely seating outside, but can be quite dark. We got seated and it took a while to get our menus. Slowly, we got a free appetizer bite (delicious fig on Rosemary shortbread), though no silverware or napkins. Eventually, after a long time we were able to order. \nWe all did the tasting menu.\nThe sweet bread special was cooked very well and was tasty. Octopus was a salad, which I hadn't realized beforehand. It was just okay. Shrimp appetizer was okay (one shrimp).\nThe gnocchi was excellent- wow probably the best dish. Fluffy gnocchi with mint on top, which was a great layer. Squid ink with calamari was just okay. The lamb ragu special was good, but forgettable.\nThe ribeye was very heavy, but very delicious. Loved the egg on top. Cooked well. Buttery.\nThe salmon special was cooked well and was very delicate and flakey.\nThe magi stew was just okay.\nChocolate tort was thick and delicious. Panna cotta was well executed. Very smooth. The tiramisu was not my fav- they had a fruity take on it.\nOverall, the food was great and we got tons of food. We were stuffed. Service was seriously off. Insanely slow start. We were there 2.5 with the first 45 minutes just ordering and getting our table set. They also accidentally threw out two of our leftovers!",

  "text": "Located in a highly desirable spot, but in a very undesirable looking hotel, Bongos was a sharp contrast to it's surrounding, largely run down property. I am sure you've already looked at the pictures and know that you'll get a chance to seat on the beach while enjoying a meal. Although that's absolutely true, I'll write about an element that pictures won't describe.\n\nFun and friendly staff make the visit worthwhile. You'll get a piece of fish anywhere in St Pete, but finding such great people is hard. The bartender was managing a ridiculous influx of thirsty tourists and doing it in a friendly, efficient manner. All drinks are made from pre-made Walmart shelf mixers, so don't expect anything exquisite. Rum selection is as basic as it gets, Bacardi, Morgan or well. The place has a very typical, average American beach bar feel to it. Of course, that comes included with country music and southern middle class crowd. In other words, people who want to be country, but live in a city like Birmingham, Mobile, Augusta and the like.\n\nFood is fine. Again, standard stuff. The much recommended artichoke dip was pretty good. Seafood selections aren't phenomenal, but there. Lots of fried items as you'd expect at an American beach bar.\n\nThe establishment shines of course in one area and that's its location. Right on the beach, it's a perfect spot to watch the sunset and have a beer.",

  "text": "I go to Fleming's about once a year.  I know that while it will be expensive, all the food will be good, the service will be friendly, and the atmosphere will be clean and comfortable.\n\nMy friend and I sat in the bar - first at the bar for cocktails, and then moving into a bar booth for dinner.  Our server was efficient, although a little slammed with all the tables she had going.  Great deals for happy hour from 5-7 - they offer 5-$6 drinks, and 5-$5 appetizers.  \n\nTaking advantage of the discounts, we shared the pork belly and tenderloin carpaccio to start with.  The pork belly was just okay - the best part of that plate was actually the creamy goat cheese grits that accompanied it - yum!  The sweet onion chutney was just not enough of a contrast with the rest of the plate.\n\nThe carpaccio was excellent.   It was a generous portion, sliced extremely thin, with capers and a creole mustard sauce on top,  with cheesy crackers to put it on.  My one wish would have been more 'bite' to the sauce.\n\nFor dinner I had the French Onion soup and the small plate of New Bedford Scallops.  This was one of the best French Onion soups I have ever had.  It was baked with both gruyère and parmesan cheeses, with a nice crispness to the bread inside.  The cheese topping was incredible, and the broth was flavorful without being too salty.\n\nI liked the scallops, but didn't love them.  The sauce had flavor, but the scallops didn't really seem to.  I  know, I know, only eat steak in a steakhouse, but I'm a seafood girl!\n\nFor dessert  we split the carrot cake.  Since I am a carrot cake connoisseur, I will rate this one 6/10.  Very moist which I love, it did not have even close to enough frosting on it/in it.  I guess that's why they serve it with a side of homemade whip cream - there needs to be some sweetness to contrast the non-sweet flavor of the cake part.  More than just a tiny drizzle of dark rum caramel on the side was needed, too.\n\nFinal thought - GET WIFI!  Sheesh - close to the airport, close to many businesses - enter this century and make the upgrade - thanks!",

I felt very carefree and happy just as a result of being up there. Our server, Charles, was very charismatic and fun. I like that he introduced himself and shook hands with everyone at all of his tables, and remembered mine and Devin's names throughout the meal. \"Christine, my love, how are you doing?\" Charming as hell. Loved it. The entire team of servers worked together seamlessly to clear plates in a timely manner and keep our water glasses full. Charles also put together a really adorable birthday card for me and had a bunch of staff members sign it. Awesome!\n\nThe food was pretty good. Not stellar, but definitely good. I liked the escargot but felt the puff pastry was kind of stale. The soup was not my style, but it was really my fault for ordering something when I didn't know what it was. Tip for the French cuisine-ignorant: vichyssoise is served cold. It would have been MUCH better hot. Like clam chowder, except smoked salmon. But I didn't really like it cold. The pork chop was good but didn't blow me out of the water. Devin got the monkfish special which was MUCH better. The star of my meal was the creme brulee! It was truly perfect.\n\nI did the prix fixe menu which was reasonable at $38.99 for 4 courses, and they were full size - not tiny tasting plates - so it was a really great deal. \n\nI would be willing to try other things off the menu again, but I definitely want to come back to enjoy some of their delicious drinks (the cocktails were superb - I recommend the Summer Fashion - like an Old Fashioned with a peachy twist) and desserts on that lovely patio.",

Because it's the perfect time to for some preventative medicine at Golden Flower! \n\nGrab a table and get ready to fight off that hangover with a banging bowl of pho, some delicious imperial egg rolls, or one of their cold noodle dishes! On this last visit I'd had enough liquid courage to allow me to order the most daunting dish on the menu, Bun Bo Hue, a spicy noodle soup made with a rich, complex, and meaty broth, packed full of all the best animal tidbits like well-done flank, rare beef, tendon, and oh yes, blood cake! The version here does tendon right! It cooks for hours in the broth until extremely tender, all the while absorbing the rich flavors of the stock. Andrew Zimmern would describe it as meat jelly, and I'd concur. If it eats like that, you know it's good! The blood cake is harder to describe, but it turns out it was way more a textural thing than a flavor. Kind of thought it would be a little different, but eating it is worth the shock value! I'll be back for more of this soon! \n\nBut slide a big bowl of that up right next to a big plate of the chicken wings they have on their late night menu, and that is a match made in heaven! My fiancee, who enjoyed her night just as much as I did ;), only ate a tiny bit of soup that night before we went home. The next morning, Bun Bo Hue #FTW!

Must try, and totally worth $6.",

  "text": "Seeking a hole-in-the-wall - truly authentic- Mexican restaurant? Los Portales is the spot. I was meeting a friend for dinner and decided to go out on a whim and randomly pick a place. Random, I tell you. I saw that Los Portales had one review, but it was a good one. The restaurant itself is located in a not so attractive area, but try to look past that fact when pulling into the parking spot. I honestly debated whether or not we should stay, but we decided to give it a try.\n\nThe place, though small, was filled with lively folk.  There was a group of guys glued to the soccer game on tv while on the other side of the place sat a family chowing down on fresh chips and salsa.  While looking through the menu, we quickly noticed that everything was in Spanish. Everything. Really made me wish I would have paid more attention in my Spanish class in high school. I'm telling you, everything about this place was authentic. The food was delicious and incredibly affordable. I was able to eat two large tacos for less than $5. Our waitress, even though she had difficulty communicating with us, was very attentive and helpful. \n\nI want to reiterate that this place isn't in the most glamorous part of Indy. Please don't let this detour you away, though.  It's definitely worth the stop.",

However, the Larb Gai appetizer, chicken mixed with chili powder, scallions, mint leaves, Thai herbs and lime juice served with sliced cabbage, was outstanding, with a fabulous, fresh flavor.\n\nFor my entrée I had the Amazing, which was anything but.  Served cool, with a cloying, sweet brown sauce on top, it was almost inedible.  I sent it back to be warmed up, but that just made it even worse. My boyfriend had their special fried rice which he liked, but they must have gotten their 'heat level' confused, because his ordered medium was extra fiery.\n\nService was just okay. They had two waiters in the restaurant, and while they were attentive at first, that dropped off as more tables arrived.

It certainly helped that I was with Boon, Grace, Fernelly and Rachel who are always entertaining..\n\nNate was friendly and helpful and I started off with a few samples. Didn't love the pomegranate (not pomegrantey enough) but the cookies and cream, coffee, yellow cake, and birthday cake were all good. The original tart wasn't the best I've had, maybe on the sweet side? but it was fine. The watermelon is SUPER interesting and fun. \n\nThe toppings are also very playful. lots of sweets like gummies, chocolate covered gummies, licorice strands, sour strips as well as fruit. The price seemed quite reasonable for what I got. The place was pretty busy even late and it's nice that it was open late enough for us to enjoy. Seating was comfortable and the decor is nice. Well lit. People were friendly. \n\nIf they had mochi and the blackberries were a lil better looking I would give it five stars. No WiFi also a lil disappointing. And I like fresh mango and kiwi toppings. Makes me believe I am being healthy.. But otherwise it's definitely a super fun place with a lot of variety, taste and fun.

I entered the restaurant and was immediately greeted by the cashier! She was friendly and helpful. My \"go to\" dish at any Chinese restaurant is the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice; and so I didn't have to think about what I wanted to order. What I really enjoyed about this place was that instead of the egg roll as the traditional side, I could choose crab rangoon instead! I LOVE crab rangoon and had actually thought about ordering a side of them; but since they were included in the meal I had to get them. They were to die for! Creamy and delicious! The sweet and sour chicken was phenomenal and just the way I love it! Some places use chicken that I find to be too chewy, but this was tender and juicy! Just thinking about it is making me hungry again. \n\nI will be making another visit and have another dish I plan to try! I will let you know how that goes!",

PB crunch was mostly vanilla with chocolate covered peanuts mixed in the swirl which gave it that \"crunch\".  Brazilian was of a lighter coffee taste.  After the two scoops in a waffle, my friend decided to get a small frozen yogurt which really turned out to be a HUGE one.

Coxx, Roxx, Boxx, people who lack my moral compass and Rick Santorum bumper sticker collection tell me, as examples, are popular choices. So with this purely academic knowledge, it was surprising when I saw it was indeed Quick Fixx, with that extra sexy (sexxy?) 'x.'\n\nThe Fixx flatbread ($8) with white sauce, bacon, caramelized onions and gruyere was rich and filling. However, the richness really covered up the salty pork flavor I was hoping would counter the inherent heaviness. The caramelized onions were done right and added great flavor, managing to stand out slightly. The dish is very good, I was just hoping for a little more balance, that extra level that makes it pop. Despite the Shaq-sized palmfuls of cheese the crust held up admirably and added a nice little crunch.\n\nGnocchi ($12) was the definition of A-OK: absolutely fine, the bolognese was very tasty on its own, but nothing that I can say a lot about, other than you wouldn't be in harm's way ordering it.\n\nQF also has a snack/late night/late chance to ditch that ugo you met at closing time menu. It's an admirable step up from your typical late night eateries and includes Panzarotti poppers ($7), dubbed as mini fried dough balls filled with goat cheese, shallots and chives. They seem baked to me, though. Tagging along is an apple jam sauce that provides a kick of sweetness to the velvety goat cheese. Parmigiano-Reggiano dusted fries ($3, big enough to share) come with ketchup and toum--a Lebanese garlic sauce similar to aioli but with olive oil. Push the Heinz to the side and focus on this.\n\nThe service is top notch. Concern gushes from who I presumed to be the owner like blood from a gun shot wound. The sheer brute dedication to his business mirrors what Kenneth the Page has for 30 Rock. The prices, portions, and quality match up well. Very close to 4 stars. I'll be back.",

While I understand lunchtime is when the major rush is (and I hope they have the appropriate number of staff to accommodate it), around 5PM there were only 2 people serving the 7 people in line. It seemed to be the manager and one of the employees. This location could use a few more people to service its customers. \n\nOther than that - it's a Qdoba. You know what to do.",

The menu is like 12 pages long...the only problem, the martini glasses are really small..as for the restaurant next door, the decor is cool and it feels, yes, swanky for sure....I've never really had stellare service or food here except for one thing...the souffle desert!! OMG you have to order it at the beginning of your dinner because it takes 30 mins to cook but it is SOOOOO good...the best one I've ever had, and I will always go back just for that!",

Well the service this day was abominable. They literally threw what I ordered in a bowl in such a way that half of what they threw landed on the assembly line bar and not in my bowl. It was as if none of the employees had been trained in how to make orders. What caused me fury the most was their was a line nearing the door and I had to wait 15 minutes for the cashier to come back to her station to pay, at that point I just walked out leaving my order on the line. This place is too far a drive for me to get this bad a service thus at that point the free coupon meant nothing because I will probably never come here again.",

  "text": "Royal Orchid is a very large restaurant with multiple seating areas and an open bar area in a Ramada Hotel in Westshore. They serve up some first rate Indian cuisine and also have other Asian and continental dishes in an extensive menu to meet all tastes. They are introducing a lunch buffet for 2015. They also have an extended happy hour and lunch specials.\n\nThe multiple seating areas at Royal Orchid can accommodate a very large gathering but the setup maintains intimacy and comfort and isn't overwhelming at all. The main space is a large open area with a bar area and dining space with high tables and comfy booths. There is also a patio area, more secluded side dining area and banquet rooms.\n\nRoyal Orchid serves various Asian dishes and offers a lunch buffet. The Tom Yam Goong, Thai shrimp coconut lemongrass soup, was tasty. The lamb korma was excellent with a rich subtle taste. The mango lassi was rich and delicious. The naan was excellent. They will spice to the heat desired and the food tends to have some zip.\n\nDishes are served in hammered silver bowls and rice (white, brown, jasmine) that are conducive yo family style and group dining. Have as much or as little of any one dish as you like! They also split a soup no problem so two of us could share it. Serving various dishes over a rice felt traditional and everything tasted very good. \n\nWe met the chef who has more than two decades of experience internationally. Our server Kristina was super and sweet. It's a classy tasteful feeling space but also relaxed. There are even nooks with pool and Foosball for gamers.\n\nLook forward to returning. Hope people find this great space with some very tasty dishes.",

Fortunately I remembered Rachel's and Steven's reviews and was able to savor a bowl of the comforting pleasure that hand drawn noodles delivered.\n\nif my pho addiction had taught me anything its that the perfect asian soups have to be filled with a revitalizing broth, a plentiful and oftentimes odd assortment of additional ingredients, and a helping of some of the best noodles that you've ever had; all while coming at a fairly inexpensive pricetag. And for just $6 the seafood soup with shrimp, scallops, clams, and fish balls had Nan Zhou delivering on all cylinders. But the main thing I wasn't expecting was the fact that the tantalizing consistency and interesting back story of the hand drawn noodle recipe may have me giving pho and ramen a stink eyed comparison for the forseeable future.\n\nBe sure to bring cash to get your fill, but not a whole lot unless your table feels the need to split random delicacies like marinated duck, beef tendons, and spicy pig ears. And be sure to keep your vegetarian friends at a distance.",

The exterior and interior aesthetics scream antique candy/malt shop and it smells awesome once you step foot inside. When I walk inside, I immediately look at the giant chalkboard that list the current flavors. Note: Some flavors are subject to change. On my last visit I tried the Creole Strawberry Sundae-- Fresh strawberries served over a mound of our famous creole cream cheese ice cream topped with whipped cream, a cherry, and a wafer, which came in a huge sundae glass, topped with dips of creole cream cheese flavored ice cream, fresh strawberries and graham cracker. It looked too cute to bite into so I made sure to take a photo and upload it first. Then I took the first bite and seen rainbows. I am very dramatic but I like--well--love Creole Creamery and wish I lived down the street as a kid vs. Dairy Queen. I feel robbed. If you want, they offer samples to taste and try different unique flavors like Lavender Honey, which is also good. Next time, I am going to try either another sundae or Ice Cream Sampler--\n--4 mini scoops or  6 mini scoops--so that I can try more awesome frozen goodness. \nOh, and bring cash, this place is true to tradition, no fancy cards to swipe in this place.",

Over the years I've had many different concoctions of this sandwich and Yiro Yiro's version was pretty darn good.\nI DoorDashed them yesterday and delivery was extremely quick and I appreciated the care and the use of quality packaging they use. You would be surprised seeing how some spot use cheap containers for their food.\nI ordered the beef/lamb combo with a rice pilaf, fresh salad of diced tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant and spices, and a wonderful spicy feta dip. I finished the meal with a scrumptious baklava.\nThe meal came with triangular shaped grilled pita bread. The portions were abundant.  I grabbed a slice of the pita bread and crammed as much of the meat the bread could handle and smeared the spicy feta cheese dip over it. What a heavenly bite! The beef and lamb was tender and that spicy feta was the truth. The rice pilaf was fluffy and not dried out and I didn't know the name of the salad, but it was so fresh and crisp, a perfect accompanying item for the meal.\nThe baklava was magnificent, two large pieces encrusted with honey and pistachios with a thin layer of vanilla icing across the top of the philo dough. It was a sweet ending to a good meal. \nI would have awarded Yiro Yiro 5 stars if I would have received whole pieces of the grilled pita bread so I could make a whole gyro, the small pieces of pita ran out quickly. Next time I will ask for that in advance.",

Now, little bit of a disclaimer... some of my girlfriends are really into the whole Twilight/Vampire Diaries thing. I am not. But I'm not opposed to vampire lore. I've read my fair share of Ann Rice books and seen plenty of old vamp horror flicks.\n\nThe tour I pictured was something completely different. Intimate and entertaining with just a little bit of kitsch. It was none of this. First of all, at the meeting place I was expected there to be maybe 10-15 people waiting. There were so many people (75-100?) that I was confused. Who were all these people? Were we all going on the same tour? They broke us into \"smaller\" groups and away we went. Our \"small\" group had maybe 20-25 people and seemed to keep picking up more as the tour went on. You couldn't hear anything the \"host\" was saying unless you were on his heels constantly. The stories were kind of boring and dragged on. \n\nMost of us ended up bailing half way through. I hate to say it but this was kind of a waste of money.",

  "text": "French Quarter Haunted Ghost Tour\n\nGreat tour with Clint! We had a better \"haunted\" experience this time with our tour guide, Clint (in reference to our first experience last year). We used our City Pass and booked an evening of the French Quarter Haunted Ghost Tour. We stopped by famous places like Lalaurie Mansion, Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop and the Omni Royal as Clint proceeded to tell us stories behind each landmark and, you know, ghostly sites and stuff where ghastly spirits have been documented. I found the stories fascinating.\n\nLafitte's Blacksmith Shop is actually a bar and it has a long haunted history. We were given a chance to go inside and check it out for a chance encounter with Jean Lafitte. Legend has it that he simply stands in the dark corners, staring at people until he is noticed, at which time his ghost disappears into the shadows. Not sure if his ghost would show up with all that people inside but supposedly he is always seen on the first floor, most of the time near the fireplace that's inside. Well, that was just one of his stories... there's many more where it came from. \n\nThis non-theatrical, non-costumed tour guide shared events rooted in NOLA history and feature historically accurate storytelling. Clint was a great storyteller, no sugar coating anything. The tour was about two hours long. It is a walking tour so wear comfy shoes and probably bring a bottle of water to hydrate yourself. Normal Entry Price - Adult: $25.00  \n\nReview #1500 updated",

  "text": "Acme was recommended by so many friends for my New Orleans trip, so I made it a must-try. \n\nWe came on my birthday (Friday night) in December and the wait actually wasn't too bad at 7PM. We waited maybe 20 minutes and got seated promptly. The inside is casual (no fancy) but I have no cares for ambiance if the food is on point. \n\nWe ordered (from favorite to least favorite):\n\n1. Raw oysters (5/5 stars): WOW. Have I ever tasted such plump, fresh, delicious oysters in my life? I think not. This was most definitely the best fresh tasting oysters I've had the luxury of trying. Amazing. (Raw here is better than Felix's)\n\n2. Softshell crab (5/5 stars): !!! Holy crap. First time eating crab this way - fried but the meat is so soft, so good. The outer layer of fried crust is just perfect - flavorful but not too thick.\n\n3. Chargrilled oysters (4/5 stars): Yum! The chargrilled oysters were flavored with butter, sea salt, cheese, lemon and who knows what else. I really enjoyed dipping the French bread in the sauce - perfect pairing. Still, I always prefer raw oysters to chargrilled because I like the original taste without being masked by so many other condiments. \n\n4. Boo fries (3/5 stars): Fries with roast beef gravy and cheese. Good side to have, but not the best fries in the world. I guess Acme can't be the best at everything haha.\n\n5. Jambalaya (2/5 stars): Nooooo. The rice was rather bland and dry. Not much going on here. Jambalaya is MUCH better at Felix's. \n\nOVERALL\nLOVED IT. For the price it's totally worth coming here, everyone ate to their heart's content and each person only came out to about $25 including tip. If I ever make another NOLA trip this is a must go-back-to :)",

  "text": "Redheaded Stranger is no longer a stranger to me and I am glad about that. The staff, the food, the ambiance and the concept are all great. I think over time it has the potential to be 5 stars but there are a couple of things I think could get it there.\n\nMy friend and I came for a late lunch but there was a line out the door. This is quickly becoming a popular spot! We waited in line for about 30 minutes before we were able to order at the front. The restaurant has a retro/Southwest kind of feel with cactus plants lined up along the window and the mod tables and chairs. They have an outdoor spacious patio that they had decked out with misters which in this August heat was a great idea (although umbrellas would be an even better one). They have a long bar area with seating and then an open kitchen and a place where you can see them making the flour tortillas, fresh. When we got up to order we were informed it would be a 40 minute wait for our food. Since we had already spent 30 minutes in line we were already invested so we stuck it out and waited although we were super hangry by the time the food actually came. Just a note that you will need to patient about the wait if you come here! \n\nMy friend and I both got 2 tacos each since the size looked pretty substantial. The barbacoa taco had a lot of meat in it (yay) as well as black beans, red peppers and a hot sauce. This was super tasty. I also got a vegetarian taco which had poblano peppers, hot sauce and whipped feta. This was also really good so I was happy with these. My friend had ordered queso which was advertised as coming with tortillas. I had made a comment that this was interesting that it didn't say tortilla chips and she had responded that she was sure it was a fried tortilla like a tostada. It was not. The queso came with 2 flour tortillas. Although the queso is a smaller portion, 2 tortillas is not enough to eat with the queso. Conceptually I get it that maybe they want to show off their fresh, housemade tortillas but the practicality factor is just not there. They should reconsider this and serve with housemade tortilla chips!  \n\nPersonally I am a fan but for a pretty small menu it seemed like a really long wait. I understand that this is not a fast food joint but the things we ordered should have already pretty much been prepped and ready to go so I think they could be a bit more efficient there. Otherwise, all great!",

  "text": "They have declined so greatly since my last visit three years ago. Their new name should be Misdirection. \n\nTheir seating is right on top of other tables. Hard to be comfortable sitting with your back in someone else's back. \n\nI was mostly disenchanted by the menu changes since my last visit of 2008. I remembered that I used to be able to order any variety of mac n cheese toppings for a reasonable value that improved with quantity of toppings. Now there are only three set \"levels\" of the appetizer, more expensive and lacking the creativity of the build your own variety style mac menu. I felt like the whole reason to return to this restaurant had been compromised, but ordered mac anyway because obviously I had been looking forward to the taste. Unfortunately, our waitress discouraged my custom order by saying that the menu had always been that way, at least as long as she knew. Not only that, but having worked there for three years, she nonetheless refused to acknowledge our longer term patronage in favor of her dwindling recollection of the time they must have streamlined the menu for faster prep, instead of made to order.\n\nAnother menu anomaly was the yogurt smothered lamb burger. My friend was perplexed when his came out of the kitchen. Our waitress merely indicated that the menu description was accurate (It still claim it WASN'T... see attached menu screenshot) and that we could try to absorb the unwanted yogurt sauce with napkins. However, the item had been so smothered in white cream and could hardly enough be salvaged.\n\nAll in all, I was very disappointed with my last time in Misdemeanor, Misdirection, whatever you want to call it.",

  "text": "After visiting our eldest grandson and his new apartment on the west side, we decided to take him to lunch.  Mexican food was agreed upon by all of us and w decided to give La Hacienda a try.  It can be a little difficult to find since it stuck in an inner corner of a large building.  We ended up driving all the way around just to find it.  \n\nAlthough the parking lot needed some cleaning and pot holes filled, Once we pulled up to the restaurant, we found the interior to be clean and lively.  we were given our choice of booth or table and we chose a section where the music was not too loud.\n\nAll three of us ordered something from the lunch menu which was fairly large serving for the price.  Our food came with chips and salsa.  The salsa was very thin with just a hint of heat to it.  The chips were light and crisp...good  enough to munch on even without salsa.  Our entrees came with beans and rice as well, so a full meal. Service was pretty good and the wait time on the kitchen was acceptable.  My wife decided to add a frozen strawberry margarita and thought it needed more mix (not enough berry flavor.)  The waiter brought us our bill and I paid at the front counter.  Overall, a pleasant meal and experience.\n\n#Review 3966",

  "text": "Kind of a limited buffet, but for $5.20 (2007's price) (includes drink, but not tax) for lunch, it's a heck of a deal. No salad bar, but they did have jello, a couple different canned fruits (pineapple and fruit cocktail), and orange wedges. And the hot items that they had on the steam trays were more than acceptable; and I'd even say very good, considering the price.\n\nI got there shortly after the lunch rush, and just had the buffet, but the food wasn't old. And people kept coming in for carry-out.\n\nThe limited buffet, with it's low-low price, makes it mainly a fill-up-cheap place. But, ordering off the menu gets you more variety and quality. Their extended hours are good if you are in the neighborhood, until 10pm weeknights, and 11pm Fri/Sat.\n\nTheir red and green colored menu has a lot more items than standard walk-up Chinese restaurants. Lots of Szechuan style stuff on the menu.\n\nMonday through Thursday: 10:30 am to 10:00pm. Friday and Saturday: 10:30 am to 11:00pm. Sunday: 12:00 noon to 10:00pm.",

  "text": "A slow, boring, day afforded my friend the time to randomly search for Mexican establishments. When it came time to eat he recommended this place and off we went. \n\nLocated just a few blocks from Broad and South Streets, Quetzally is nestled into a residential neighborhood. I cannot recall seeing another establishment in the immediate area. The dining area is not very large but capable of accommodating a decent amount of patrons. When we arrived we were the only people in the restaurant.  Within minutes the place was packed. \n\nWe started our dining service with a plate of nachos. After all, that is what brought us to Quetzally. My friend chose this place because of the nachos. He is considered the nacho aficionado of the group and the nachos are what sold him on this place. While we may not agree on his nacho rankings, one cannot question his ability to seek out some of the greatest heaps of meat, cheese, salsa, and sour cream on a bed of tortilla chips and the nachos at Quetzally were just that, a heaping mound of goodness. \n\nOnce we polished off the nachos I decided to go with the Chicken Tinga burrito. I was expecting a certain level of spice due to the chicken marinating in a chipotle sauce. I didn't quite find the level of spice I was seeking, but the flavor was  present. That had to be one of the best burritos I have had in Philadelphia. \n\nThe service is cool. Even when things got a little busy for the one server she was still on top of her game. There is a $15 credit card minimum. We didn't know so when we asked to split the check the waitress tried to work with us but there was nothing she could do. The manager got a little testy. No worries",

My go-to's are the Winter Melon Milk Green Tea, Mango Slush, and Coffee Macchiato depending on the day. The menu is extensive so there's enough to suit everyone's taste. What made this location different was the fact that it offered an actual good food selection for a reasonable price. Surprisingly, the food is delicious. I did not expect that whatsoever considering it was coming from a coffee/boba shop.\n\nAs a recent college grad, this place is perfect for setting up camp to study all day. Apart from having food and drinks, they are open fairly late and there are plugs with almost every table aka a college student's DREAM.",

  "text": "The Kitchen is one of the dining establishments at the River Cree Resort & Casino, located just outside of Edmonton's city limits on the Enoch reserve.  It is a large, open space with tables and booths, excellent lighting, and unassuming decor. \n\nI won a gift certificate for the restaurant a while back, and decided to treat a couple of my friends to an evening out. We were all incredibly impressed with the buffet, which served a wide range of food with quality, style, and selection. I have never been to a buffet with such high class food. Starting with the salads, I enjoyed spring mix greens, wild rice with chicken, and an incredibly flavourful and unique turkey with pineapple salad, which was exactly as described: large chunks of turkey and pineapple brought together in a light, creamy dressing.\n\nNext, was a selection of seafood such as crab legs, mussels, and smoked whitefish. The seafood was served ice cold, and looked very fresh. Due to dietary restrictions I only sampled the whitefish, which was delicious but would have been better had it been fully thawed before serving.\n\nThere was a bread service, roasted potatoes, vegetables, pasta dishes, and a chef's station serving up stir-fries. The final part of the buffet were the main courses, which on this evening included fried chicken in a sweet chili sauce, skirt steak in peppercorn sauce, a fish dish, and a jambalaya. The steak and chicken made the meal for me - both were excellent, with the sauces adding flavour without overwhelming.\n\nThen came dessert. The desserts are in a separate area and include fresh fruit, cakes, and a hot dessert. You can accent your sweet treats with a variety of toppings such as whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and caramel. I sampled the black forest cake, brownies, strawberry shortcake, and pumpkin pie. Unlike the meager slivers served at most buffets, the pieces here were of substantial sizes. I did not care for the hot dessert, which was mincemeat, but someone else at my table enjoyed it.\n\nA trip to The Kitchen is just a short drive and worth the trip. On a Saturday evening the buffet will cost you $19.95, and on most other nights it is only around $15. There is a lunch buffet available most days. Beverages cost extra.  The coffee is excellent.  I definitely hope to head here again.",

Uhhh excuse me but the streets were clear since late last night with no snow nor rain in the forecast today. Management should have advised their staff to be there, instead we were told only kitchen staff were there and they couldn't open without someone to work the box office. Major fail management! \n\nHonestly the one in collegeville isn't much better so I guess I'll just suck it up a little longer until something better comes along to replace this disappointment.\n\nIf I MUST say something nice it would be you can pretty much always find parking and that shopping center has some pretty decent stores lol",

The trendy and very up to date look created a great ambiance. The service was friendly and prompt, but we did get the early bird special dining at 5pm with only 2 other groups in the place.\n\nThe reason it gets 2 stars is what we really came for...the sushi. We ordered 6 rolls and all greatly lacked flavor. I usually never use soy sauce when I eat sushi and I definitely needed it that night as the sushi was so bland! I could tell it was very fresh and neatly prepared, but it just tasted boring. The best tasting roll was the sweet potato roll as many other reviewers mentioned, but I still wasn't that impressed by it. The rainbow roll, tuna king roll, and kirkwood roll all tasted very bland despite how expensive and how many ingredients go in to them. The spicy shrimp roll was not spicy at all, and the lobster tempura roll was way over cooked as it was rubbery when trying to chew it.\n\nSorry to say that Sushi Bistro did not impress. They did everything else but their signature items well, and sadly if you can't win me over with the food I definitely won't be a satisfied customer.",

  "text": "Otto by Polop offered  delicious food with atmosphere it was nice enough.  I had dinner there on Sunday night with two large tables of 10 each. The \nServers handled the crowd very well. I've heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. I would say that all in all it almost lived up to the hype. The restaurant feels like an independent mom and pop shop. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of space. The Decour was mostly updated but minimal. Everyone seems to enjoy their entrées and appetizers. My Caesar salad was good but very lightly dressed to the point where I had to ask for more dressing. I noticed that another guest ordered anchovies with their salad. I guess it's better to add more dressing and salt than have something overdressed. I should've done that but it wasn't offered to me. My friend had triangles of polenta that were topped with a mushroom sauce that needed a little bit of salt to make it pop.\n    I enjoyed one of their special plates. The pasta was a little \"purses\" filled with Gorgonzola and was swimming in a  a light fresh marinara sauce. There was also shrimp that was good but nothing really to write home about. As I looked around the table, I noticed other people really liking their meals. The veal chop Milanese standed out to me and looked amazing. It was big, bold and delicious. (I had a bite) I might get something like that next time. I'm offering 4 perfectly solid shiny stars for this review. If you were looking for a refreshing 'ma and pop' Italian restaurant that serves a great consistent meal then give this place a try. It reminded me of the old Berwyn restaurant called Alfredo that, sadly, closed down during Covid. Otto by Poloa has a simular vibe. Don't forget that this is BYOB",

There are a few cushy armchairs in the \"man cave\" section.  Got a lot of friends? There's a room with a moderately sized long table, enough for a dozen people, maybe more. Just moved to town and haven't met anyone yet? There are two bars you can belly up to. If you've got a butt, it belongs somewhere in Dunderbak's.\n\nBonus for USF students: You can get off the Bull Runner C at Skipper Road, walk a block north to Bruce B. Downs, and across the Hess parking lot to Dunderbak's, then walk back the same way when you're going home. Check the shuttle hours, especially on weekends, but there's no need to worry about driving home safely when you can let the Bull Runner be the designated.",

I went during the day on a Monday and was the sole customer. \n\nThey have preset flavors and toppings. We tried the strawberry cheesecake, and it was smooth and creamy. Very good. The strawberry themed toppings were quite good too. \n\nThey also have popsicles that can be eaten as is or dipped in chocolate and toppings.

The foot massage started with a dunk of our feet in warm water then reflexology for 40 minutes for $27.  They have a flyer with the reflexology points to review.

It makes me want to hoist up the John B sails and find a wily whale to pursue, preferably in white. \n\nThe beer list would be awesome in most cities but is kind of unremarkable for Philly. Your Bells and your Dogfishes can be had here. They seem to rotate the drafts frequently, so I can count on finding something good to drink here. The beer list and cocktails change with the season (hot boozy cider right now, for example) - I wish more places would do this.\n\nIf you're looking for diet-busting bar food on a budget, this is the place for you. Vegetarian options (and they abound) include a hearty house-made veggie burger, a grilled cheese livened up with pepper relish, and fontina mac n cheese to which you can add a number of things (arugula, red pepper and roasted garlic for me, please).\n\nWith lots of TV screens with sports on them, sometimes this place is packed to the gills with polo shirt types. I have yet to discern their migration patterns - sometimes I'll be sure this place will be a dudebro no go (Friday night at 8?) and it's merely humming and pleasant, and other times the flocks will descend unexpectedly. When it's quiet, though, this is a fine place to have a beer and a cheap dinner and dream of plying the wine-dark seas...",

  "text": "[Preface] \nAnyone who has been watching the whole Yelp photos conversation will appreciate the fact that I made the decision to go to Santa Fe this evening because it was the first business I found in the mobile app that didn't have a photo uploaded. John L will appreciate the fact that I uploaded two dark, blurry, almost useless photos. \n\n[Background]\nOver the course of the last several years, the building that now exists as Santa Fe was a succession of different restaurants -- it was [insert name I'm forgetting], then Nonna Mia's (I think), then Santa Fe. My memory fails me with regard to the details (clearly), but the point is there were a bunch of different businesses in this location, and Santa Fe was the only one that stuck since I've been paying attention. \n\n[Rumors/Hearsay]\nIn any event, the first feedback I heard from other people who'd been to Santa Fe was entirely negative. (I won't repeat some of the more colorful statements, entertaining as they may have been; suffice it to say that the food was allegedly not good.) Therefore, I fully expected to see another restaurant take its place rather quickly, and was puzzled when this did not happen. Eventually, I came up with the theory that they *must* have kickass margaritas, because if the food is as bad as I'd heard it was, then people keep going back because they have an awesome time, love the margaritas, and drink so many they either don't care or can't remember whether or not the food was any good. \n\n[Personal Experience]\nWell, I finally had a chance to experience Santa Fe firsthand, and here is what I have to report: \n\n-It's a bustling place, and can get kind of loud if you sit inside, because people clearly come here and have fun (again, I suspect it's the margaritas). \n\n-In all the times I've been to this building in its various incarnations, I've never seen it so crowded and noisy (in a good way). \n\n-There's an amazing, huge, gorgeous outdoor seating area with ceiling fans, tiki torches and (tonight, at least) live music. There was a wait to get a table outside. \n\n-The food is pretty standard Mexican fare. I had nachos, which were pretty much indistinguishable from nachos I've had elsewhere. Everyone I was with enjoyed their food, so whatever people were complaining about years ago is no longer valid (if, of course, it ever was).\n\n-The service was very friendly and helpful, but a tad slow. (They were busy, though, and everybody was running around doing stuff. It's understandable.)\n\n-We were greeted by a woman who, I suspect, is one of the owners. When we left, the man who I assume is her husband bid us farewell with a sincere thank you and enthusiastic handshake. It's a nice touch.\n\n-They probably have excellent margaritas, but I can't say for sure because I (unfortunately) didn't have one. \n\n[Conclusion]\nOverall, it's a great place, and the only reason I'm giving three stars instead of four is because I need to go back and confirm they do indeed have incredible margaritas, at which point I'll update my review accordingly. \n\n[Next Steps]\nI'm going back soon for a pitcher (or two) of Margaritas.\n\n[Recommendation]\nMy advice: Go. Soon. Before it gets too cold to enjoy eating and drinking outside. \n\n[Post-Script]\nThis place totally should've been included in the \"Yelping Alfresco\" edition of the New Orleans Weekly Yelp. It shall appear in round two, should there ever be a round two.",

  "text": "Man. It's been a LONG time since I have been to PM! So when my friend and I needed a stop for our Friday night Restaurant Week adventure, we decided to enjoy the 3 course meal for $20.13 offered here!\n\nWe were able to grab a table a little after 6pm and ordered the white and red sangria. YUM. Very tasty and a healthy portion for sure! Great start. We decided to have the shrimp spring rolls and moo shu quesadilla to start and wow, they did not disappoint! I loved the sauces on the side and we knew we were off to a solid start! \n\nFor entrees we decided on the green curry with chicken and the salmon teriyaki with veggies. I ordered my green curry spicy, and it was even though the heat kinda floated to the bottom of the bowl. I have to admit I didn't love the broth, it seemed a bit watered down (maybe from all the restaurant week orders?) and I was let down. The salmon was good, and I definitely grabbed more than one bite from my friend's plate.\n\nFor dessert I ordered the tempura brownie bite with caramel and my friend the coconut sticky rice with mango. Both were good but not great.  Probably wouldn't order it off the menu again. \n\nI always say that your appetizers shouldn't outshine the main course. I feel it should be a delicious and amazing build up to the grand finale that is your main dish. In this case, I was wishing I could have done a re-do of the appetizers.  \n\nWhat brought it down to 3 stars is that they rushed us out the door. I HATE when I'm still working on a course and the next one is brought out to me. Give me a minute or two please! And they weren't completely slammed or anything when we were here. \n\nOverall, not bad. I'd like to come back and have a refresher on the sushi!",

  "text": "You know you love frozen yogurt when you specifically ask for your own frozen yogurt machine so that you can make your own homemade frozen goodness. Of course, that doesn't stop me from going out to places like Yogorino and buying myself a cup; it just means that I don't go and buy it every night of the week.\n\nOf all the froyo places in Philly (and there aren't that many of them), Yogorino has the best texture. Its smooth, creamy and really does taste just like frozen plain yogurt, with a little sweetness to it but only enough to remind you that this is technically a dessert. I would also argue that they therefore have the best plain flavor, but then again it is their only flavor. This is not a place to go to if you don't like the plain froyo craze, so don't complain if you walk in and question why there's only one flavor. \n\nThey offer many of the toppings that most places have, such as fresh fruit (they had cranberries at one visit!), chocolate chips, sprinkles, but additionally they offer six different sauces in flavors like dark chocolate hazelnut (with WHOLE nuts!), walnut, white chocolate, dulce de leche, milk chocolate...its endless, and the list tends to fluctuate slightly each night it seems. I still haven't had the pistachio sauce that I desperately want to try because they never seem to have it when I go! The only issue I have is that the prices are somewhat high considering the amount of froyo you get and it only includes ONE topping; you have to pay an additional fee for more (and I'm too cheap to do THAT). \n\nHowever, the staff is very nice and jumps at the chance to explain things to you, which you might need to do since they seem to forget to label the toppings at times. That's a problem they should fix since it only holds up the line, and late at night it can get kind of long, especially on the weekends. The cups are a little weird too. I appreciate that they're supposedly biodegradable, but they really are just...weird. Worse, if you decide to walk outside with your treat and eat slowly like I do, the warm weather melts the froyo and the cups are insufficient at containing the overflow that occurs. \n\nThey recently started a card system where you get a free small cup after purchasing several, which is an awesome thing Red Mango does (they should come to Philly!). I wish they also offered a take-away option so that I could bring some back for later, but those damn cups clearly aren't designed to accommodate that request.",

  "text": "So, if you're like me & being from Southern California, listening to all the hype in your own \"backyard\" about this 5 Guys Burgers & how much better it is than In-N-Out, is somewhat blasphemous. Right? \nFrom where we currently live (here in SoCal), there is a 5 Guys approx 25 miles to the North and another about 20 miles to the South.\nWell, while visiting my brother in Palmyra N.J. for the Thanksgiving Holidays, I just so happened to discover there was one right around the way from his house. So, it was only necessary to find out what all the jibber-jabber was all about.\nWe had no plans for dinner that night after Thanksgiving, so we all decided to go. This would be me & my wife's first time at this establishment.\nTo my surprise I found that the 5 Guys' burger is quite tasty! \nI especially like their numbering system of the special ordered burgers. Loaded or unloaded, you make it your way with the fixins that are available.\nThere were 4 of us with 4 different burgers. Each wrapped burger is numbered which corresponds to the numbered burger on the receipt. On the receipt after each number is the description of each burger & its contents. Genius! One order of fries is definitely enough for two, maybe even 3 people. Very good fries by the way.\nHowever, it is definitely hard to compare their burger to the left coast's In-N-Out burger. The freshness of the Double-Double's lettuce & tomato...and if you happen to get it with grilled onions, it's perfection. The special thousand island dressing that is dolluped upon the Double-Double is...well, special! But this isn't a review about In-N-Out & their burgers...\n5 Guys is definitely a unique experience. You're getting a nibble of that side of the country. As you walk in [at this particular 5 guys] , you'll see the bags and bags of Idaho potatoes stacked waist high upon entering & there's a humongous container of peanuts right by the \"pick-up\" line for you to munch on while you wait. \nAll in all a very good East Coast experience.\n\nNow on to the 5 Guys Burgers here in Cali.\n\nThis is a deez® public announcement & me and a couple other peeps approve this review. Thanks. Eat & drink well.",

I opted to get it topped with fried oysters as well (because at this point why not lol). We also ordered sides of bacon and grits and wow we were so full and happy after that. The table side prepared bananas foster looked incredible but we were way too full to order dessert. However, they knew it was my birthday and brought me some great surprises after the meal including a sash, a Brennan's cooking apron to take home, and a giant mound of cotton candy with a candle on top which we discovered had delicious ice cream underneath.

It was prob around 5pm so there were no more than 10 guests total but by the time we left it had filled up significantly.\n\nI had the blackberry infused Jack Daniels drink and might have fallen in love, so good!  My friend and I shared the tomato basil soup, truffle mac and cheese and the BLT.  Our server was a doll and had the BLT made with the pig on the side so it wouldnt touch my half of the sandwich. It was honestly phenomenal.  I had heard so much about the mac n cheese but I thought the sandwich and my cocktail kicked its ass!\n\nThe decor, music and location of the place really make it great as well and there are seats outside (to bring your pooch) but I only saw two tables, so it was too risky to lure him there with promises of table scraps, only to not find outdoor seating!\n\nI would highly recommend returning for happy hour, the drinks were too good not to sample a few and the size of the portions are perfect for sharing a few things with friends!  Also I noticed they take reservations, so thats probably a good idea for a larger group.\n\nI def look forward to returning!",

Our visit was Monday, June 4th around 7:30pm to around 9pm.\n\nMy friend and I are in line and 2 straight couples are getting in line in front of us. When one of the males walked by me, you could smell the alcohol from him; like strong. As I watched him and his party purchase tickets and head into the event, the guys were drunk; blood shot eyes, the smell and having issues walking. I notified the staff in line (who were on their phones and only looked up when I said something) about the issue and I was told they were going to tell their manager. But I was in line for a while and never saw such action. \n\nThe biggest issue I had with this year is that, it is not a Chinese Lantern Festival without Chinese Lanterns. This year was just illuminated cloth colored animals. I mean were they going for a deep sea theme? And what was with the Game of Thrones tree? And a tarantula? And a dung beetle? The large shark was dripping some brown water from it's tail, no joke and people were walking right underneath it. I'm sorry this is not some \"light show\" in your friends backyard and that is what if felt like compared to even just last year. Please stop gentrifying (white washing and diluting) everything. It is bad enough how Chinatown is changing with all of its boutique looking generic restaurants.\n\nSecond issue, they allowed drinking everywhere. When in years past they had a \"beer garden\" area where people could drink. But this was just an awful decision on the event coordinator's part. People were noticeably drunk and even saw a staff member with full cup of beer sneaking off to behind the bathrooms. I'm not anti-alcohol but people don't know their limits so allowing them more and more events to drink at, how is that helping the situation, especially in front of their children? Events want money so allowing booze is the cheap, easy way to get it. But how many kids are left in the hands of their \"tipsy\" parent driving them home? People cant see past their own wants to understand the bigger picture. There were several females who were noticeably drunk and I was walked into at one point.\n\nThere was very little staff working this event and the staff that were there, were either at the front on their phones, or around the gates to make sure people didn't sneak in, on their phone. And at one point my friend and I smelled cannabis and he said it was one of the guards. I didn't see it so I don't know but I smelled it near them and no one else was around them.\n\nThe last thing, was the bathrooms by the beer garden (like 20ft away) smelled like fecal matter. It made me want to vomit. As we left, I spoke with the manager Wayne, who was in the ticket booth, and I told him everything I am stating here. He wanted me to identify the staff member drinking but I told him I didn't want to get involved. I did my part several times to get these people to pay attention to what was happening under their watch and no one cared to do anything. What bothers me the most is the children that were there...what if some over intoxicated person hurt one of them? It is a dark park with lots of little areas to hide. This is not a family friendly event at all.\n\nThis was definitely not like any of the other festivals from previous years and for the price we paid to deal with all of this and the staff not even caring? Yeah, I can give my money to other cause that deserves financial support. I didn't feel comfortable taking pictures of people (I don't want to show their faces) but I have uploaded a picture of 3 staff members not doing their job to add a little more credibility to my review. I don't give 1 stars out lightly if you look at my profile.",

  "text": "Stumbled into this place without even yelping (gasp!) merely because I was wandering around in Chinatown, subconsciously looking for a place worth checking out since it was my first time there. The sign caught my attention and there was a long line as I peeked in, so I made a mental note to self to come back later. When I did, the length of wait line didn't diminish much, but I went in anyway and got myself an almond milk tea.\n\nA few cultural shock points (compared to NYC bubble tea shops):\n- I ordered in Mandarin and was met with a confused slash apologetic look, so I made an awkward switch to English - awkward because I've never had to order bubble tea in English, not because I'm not fluent. So yeah, it was my first time ever ordering bubble tea in English lol. Not a bad thing at all, just different.\n- Prices were relatively cheap across the board. $3 for a medium is a pretty good deal to me as I'm used to paying at least a buck more.\n- They accept credit card!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nI also liked the layout - it's got sort of an industrial decor with its hardwood flooring, but  also a laid-back lounge feel with the high tables and, check this out - JENGA. I was there by myself (touring Philly alone) but the thought of playing Jenga while sipping on a passion fruit bubble tea sounds so quirky and fun. Like an avant-garde way of bubble tea tasting.\n\nAlso offers a variety of snacks, including onigiri rice balls(?!!). This place overall offers a refreshing, creative and fun ambience as well as decent drinks. Will definitely return the next time I come to Philly.",

The line moved quickly and they were very efficient of getting people seated as soon as possible. \n\nMy fiance ordered the shrimp and catfish platter which he liked, I had the crab cake and we both shared a dozen char-grilled oysters. I loooved the crab cake. It had so much flavor especially paired with their special corn salsa. It was our first time eating char-grilled oysters and loved that as well! I'm not sure we ate it the \"right\" way though- it came with lots and lots of bread that we just ended up discarding. Nevertheless, the oysters were cheesy, buttery and delicious. It was our mistake not ordering some raw oysters as well. We sat at the bar and could see them crack opening all the oysters in front of us- quite entertaining to watch while waiting for your meal!",

  "text": "PM was a definite regular spot for us years ago and always fit the bill when in the mood for sushi. We were in the hood for the evening and were on the lookout for something vegetarian and, of course, up pops PM on our yelpy radar. It was a pretty busy night but we were sat immediately inside at a table. There's no mistaking that most are looking for an al fresco dining experience in Nashville. It's gorgeous. \n\nI think we missed the boat a bit with our order, unfortunately. I do remember loving their sushi and especially going nuts over their veggie burger. We went a bit of a different route --\n\nVeggie Fritters - These were a little bland on our end. Not sure if we just got a weird batch? They did have some visibly delicious veg within, but the flavors were a bit flat. The dipping sauce was interesting, too. A different take on honey mustard. Not my favorite. \n\nVeggie Mu Shu - Where the veggies were pretty good, the crepes, which are typically softer, chewier, and a bit more structured, were pretty bad. They fell apart and had a really bad texture altogether. I forewent them and just ate the veggies, which again, were fantastic. \n\nVeggie Lo Mein - Holy sesame oil, Batman! That's really all I can say. It was so overwhelmingly sesame-laden that it was a bit hard to eat bite after bite. My wife only ate about 1/3 of it. \n\nThe setting of this place is just awesome, though. Killer place for a drink on the patio or even at the bar. I'd definitely recommend the sushi and veggie burger, but the items we had are a little less-than passable. Either way, still a huge fan of PM!",

The decor is modern and clean. The staff has always been attentive and helpful. \n\nMy only gripe with this place is the price. Vietnamese food is cheap. Chinese food is cheap. Indian food is non-existent in this city. Japanese food is pricy but sushi is an art and eating art ain't cheap. Anyhow... what I'm trying to say is Vietnamese/Chinese/Thai food can be very similar - especially when it's frying noodles with veggies in a sauce. I just don't understand why Thai food has to cost more? A lot more. What am I missing? \n\nSo I like the food here but I wish it were student-budget-friendly. Oh and the portion size can be bigger.

At 60% sugar level and less ice, it was still pretty sweet, so I recommend trying 30% sugar.\n\nThe colorful fruit tea was also delicious, I could taste the fruit juice and there were finely diced  tiny cubes of apples, and some passion fruit seeds. It gave the drinks a fun texture. Drinks are around $3.50 for medium or $4.50 for large.\n\nI like that this place uses real fruit, that you can taste!

  "text": "This is a pretty decent steak house, especially considering it's in a touristy beach town.  It's one of three restaurants by the same owner on St Pete Beach, the other two being Mad Fish and Snappers.  Like the other two, this one also does not have liquor, just beer and wine.\n\nThe restaurant does not take reservations and it is quite small, as is its parking lot, so chances are if you have trouble finding a parking spot, you're also going to have trouble getting a table; that's my method of determining if my wife and I will go there or not.  It's very cozy inside, perhaps 12 tables total, most being two or four tops.\n\nThis is not really a good place to bring kids, especially if they're still stroller-age, because it's nearly impossible to maneuver a stroller inside.  The only exception to that is if you're in a party of four to six.  In that case, there's a table in the front corner of the building that seats six and has room for a stroller on the end of it.  There is also no kids menu.\n\nFood-wise, everything is quite good.  I've had the ribeye, filet, chicken saltlmbocca and chicken marsala and all were excellent.  Their wedge salad is crunchy and fresh as well.  They know how to cook the steaks the way you order them, even Pittsburgh-style.  They DO have Bearnaise sauce, which is surprisingly hard to find at steak houses, and theirs is great.\n\nThe staff are generally very attentive, however, they often forget to tell you about the specials, and the specials often include items that are not on the normal menu, so make sure you ask about them if it's not mentioned as you might be missing out on something unique and great.  I had a fantastic salmon entree a few weeks ago that was not on the regular menu and would not have known had I not asked.\n\nThey have outdoor seating, but I'd probably forgo that if you're in the months of June through September because it's pretty darn warm outside.",

I imagine the company keeps on going there every year because they have some kind of connection   I cant really see any other reason\n\nFood\nStuffed mushrooms are dry and tasteless \nHow do they manage to ruin mushrooms...?\nPastas are always drowned in sauce that lacks seasoning\nSteak are always overcooked and flavorless\nService\nI never got the opportunity to get a knowledgeable waiter \n\nBartender do not know how to make a negroni nor an old fashioned!!! What!? Really? In a high end restaurant like this one says it is\n\nOn top of it, I have to agree with other reviewers, especially Pink, about the event planners. The older man does not really handle the event planning in a pleasant manner. Is almost like they are doing us a favor if you want to plan an event with them. The other ladies in the office are not attentive. First thing they said when we walked in was i hope you have an appointment. Im not sure how they do business but they are lucky they have an amazing location on the water which keeps people coming in to try it \n\nThe only thing i havent try here is brunch... So maybe they do good with eggs and waffles. \n\nIf you are looking to wow a date and have delicious food with great service you should try other Tampa places like Berns steakhoue. No panoramic views there but it is beautiful place inside and you can always take a walk on bayshore (by the bay)  after great dessert at their top floor",

  "text": "After reading many positive reviews on this Korean wonder, I knew hubby and I had to try it for ourselves!\n\nWe normally don't venture down to Temple Terrace, but were coming from an event that conveniently had us nearby!\n\nFood: Whoa. Best Korean in Tampa! I've been to Sa Ri One in Tampa, and wasn't impressed. Coming from a family of Asian background, i've had authentic Korean food and Soul of Korea is authentic! We tried the kim chi dumplings, chicken wings, sweet and sour chicken, and a steak hot pot. We totally overordered, but didn't regret the leftovers! The wings were huge and full of Korean BBQ flavor! The dumplings had the great taste of kim chi and were fried just right. The sweet and sour chicken, came with honey sauce instead of it's red imposter. The hot pot was our favorite! the mixture of Korean vegetables, fresh egg, rice, and meat was scarfed down quickly!\n\nAtmosphere: This is a little family-owned \"dive\" in Temple Terrace. Don't expect fine dining, this is more of a cafe feel type of place.  The food makes it totally worth it.\n\nService: the ladies who served our food were so friendly and sweet, they made recommendations (since we were so hungry we couldn't think straight) and they were spot-on!\n\nWe want to come back, like, yesterday. We wished it was closer to us - GO HERE if you want YUMMY Korean Food!",

Oh, and the fact that there are photos of the food emblazoned on the menu in the front--I always find that useful, but especially at places where I'm not 100% familiar with the cuisine, like authentic Sichuan noms.\n\nWe've come here a few times, and can't wait to come back. We've been trying to try something new each time we eat here, and Chengdu never disappoints. The ignite noodles were, well, Sichuan-level spicy, and they certainly did ignite all sorts of feelings. Some included tears.But it was tasty. The spicy cold chicken noodles were just as delicious, and perhaps even more peanut-y and tasty, but less intensely spicy. Perfect for a hot summer's day.\n\nThe dumplings in chili oil were some of the prettiest dumplings I've ever seen, though a bit light on the filling. I can't wait to try the dragon wontons next! The eggplant, which I'm not sure was on the menu, is breaded and covered in sweet, spicy sauce, and I think is one of my favorite ways to eat eggplant now. Their Chengdu burgers are interesting, though not necessarily what I'd come here for... that I think belongs to all the chili oil and dry pot foods.\n\nOverall, it's a great way to visit and eat through the capital of the former Shu Kingdom without a passport. I'd highly recommend for the adventurous, Scoville-loving eater in Philly!",

This one is no exception: pretty average diner with average food and average diner prices. Nothing was terrible, but nothing was outstanding either. Maybe I'm a diner snob, being from Jersey, but this one isn't particularly worth a trip out of your way. We should've saved our $25 for two people and gone to one of the Indonesian or Vietnamese places in South Philly. \n\nI will say, however, that this place is much better than the Philly diner in West Philly.

We had a mocha and a James Bond both were smooth.  I loved the mocha!  Also free smoked almonds at tables and bar.\n\nWe headed to our table, in the small circular brick room opening to the bar/kitchen.  The atmosphere was romantic and almost castle like.  Great candles!\n\nOur waiter was Clark, he was  very friendly and informative about specials and items on the menu.  We settled on the scallops, wangu burger, and a side of truffle, mushroom macaroni and cheese.\n\nWhile waiting for the food which was out in less than 10 minutes, a young lady with a basket draped in red delivered  us bacon, cheese bread. OMG, it was incredible!!  She made it back to our table just before the food hit, yes I will make room for the bread.\n\nThe scallops melted in our mouths, cooked perfectly.  They were accompanied by spinach, peas, fiddleheads, and gnocchi.  The burger was ordered medium rare and also cooked to perfection, served with thin crispy chip like fries.  The burger is out of this world.  The mac and cheese was creamy and good, but was very heavy handed with the garlic and proved to be too over powering to eat.  We did order two martinis from the bar inside a blue moon, yum like a hurricane, and a blue eyes, but it was like turpentine.  As we were leaving Clark brought another this time for Georgeann in the bar area, huge improvement.  He told us he just didn't want us to leave not enjoying ourselves. Such a class act!!\n\nWe will absolutely return.  Watch for a Groupon! Which we used in conjunction with our other Yelp check-in.",

Thanks, Sarah S., for your continual spot-on restaurant selection.\n\nEl Agave is in Watson Plaza, a large, C-shaped shopping center, with Kohl's at the top (facing west), Shop 'n Save facing Watson and El Agave at the bottom (facing east). Just turn in when you see Kohl's.\n\nThis may be the largest Mexican restaurant I've ever patronized. There's a lovely separate bar and numerous smallish dining areas.\n\nOur server was pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu. I asked him for a recommendation, and that's what I got. But I don't know its name. The menu is sporting a picture of it. Nopales are involved.\n\nAnd this massive, wonderful dish was served in a huge black \"pottery\" footed bowl lined with foil. Besides nopales, there was chicken, shrimp, pico, sour cream and vegetables . . . no doubt other things.\n\nThis was the first time in my life I've had a Mexican dish that didn't include tortillas. And that includes Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and all villages down the road from Cancun to Tulum and up the road from Mexico City to Taxco.\n\nAnd I was more than ecstatic with that.\n\nDang-bang it, was that good and continued to be fabulous with the abundance in my to-go vessel.\n\nIt was a fun evening with fellow Yelpers. Service was just right. Water was replenished in a timely fashion. And it seemed like everyone was pleased with their selections.",

Most of the people there were drinking, not eating, and now I know why. \n\nPerhaps we ordered the wrong food or were there on a bad night, but we were not at all impressed with the food. I ordered the Jagerschnitzel with spaetzl - absolutely huge portion (size of entire large plate) of schnitzel (dry, bland, and a little tough) covered in a cream sauce with mushrooms (reminded me a Campbell's cream of mushroom soup with some wine added - blech). The spaetzl was nothing special and a little rubbery. BF ordered the homemade sausages (1 pork, 1 chicken) with hot German potato salad - sausages were soooooooo dry it was hard to eat and potato salad was like boiled potatoes in pickle juice - blech. Both entrees were pricy ($16 for schnitzel, $12 for 2 sausages). \n\nServer was super friendly and interior is inviting and pleasant.",

The interior is wood booth seating, with Tiffany style lamps above each table and and lots of live plants and trees. You place your order on the Ding-a-Ling (red phone on each table) using your table #, and a server brings out your drinks and food. Our cheese bread arrived kinda lukewarm, but the pizza itself was great. I love that they put the toppings edge to edge on that wonderful thin crust. Pizza King uses crumbly sausage and thin frizzled ham rather than the bizarre \"sausage balls\" and \"ham squares\" that many large chains use. \n\nThe jukebox selection is AWFUL, unless you're a fan of bad early 90s country music.

  "text": "This was my absolute favorite meal I ate in New Orleans, and trust me... I ate A LOT of meals. I love you, Gumbo Shop!\n\nOur Lyft driver recommended this spot to us while we drove into New Orleans from the airport during our first afternoon in town. A few days later, we finally had some free time to stop in, and I was so satisfied with our experience. \n\nWe arrived around 1:30pm, which I thought might be a good time to visit since it's a bit after the normal lunch rush, but there was still quite a long line in the foyer of the restaurant. Luckily, the line moved quickly and efficiently, and were seated in no less than 10 minutes. While we waited, I began to notice the gorgeous decor and colors inside, and that the shop features two all-gender restrooms.  There was also a specials board featuring some appetizers and a gumbo plate that wasn't on the printed menu.\n\nOnce we were seated, we had a chance to look at the menu, and our waiter reiterated the specials. Gumbo Shop offers plenty of gumbo options, of course, and at fair prices. I thought they might easily charge a good amount of money for a dish, since there are always long lines outside, but their low prices may be *why* the lines are so long. Who can resist a delicious deal? I am a big fan of seafood -- and since we're in New Orleans I trust the seafood will be amazing at most places -- so I ordered the seafood okra gumbo. My boyfriend decided on the creole combination platter. \n\nWhile we waited for our food, we each ordered a beer. Gumbo Shop features some rotating options, and on this particular day they were featuring two Abita brand pours: an amber and a blonde. My boyfriend ordered the amber, and I went with the blonde. Our waiter brought these out within a few minutes, along with some bread and butter. Who doesn't love some bread and butter to start off a hearty meal?! The answer is that everyone does. \n\nWhen our food was on its way out, I got so pumped, because this was my first time eating gumbo, EVER... and once I tasted this gumbo, I knew I'd been spoiled. I will never taste gumbo as good as the one I experienced here at Gumbo Shop. Please, please, if you visit New Orleans, you must eat here. I promise the wait is much shorter than you'll expect, because service is impressive and efficient here, and the prices are low. You'll absolutely love it. \n\nI can't wait to come back next time I'm in town!",

  "text": "I am really disappointed by how they are coping with COVID.  First of all you have to download the menu on the phone.  My phone wouldn't scan the  barcode, and they didn't seem to have back up menus. Our server was short and unfriendly and not helpful at all. Luckily my friend arrived and she was able to download a much slimmer menu. Then, our \"server\" who actually didn't serve us anything,  said we needed to go get our food and pay online.  To pay online you need to open an account (?) and give out personal information.  Neither of us was comfortable with that so the server rolled her eyes and said that if we insisted we could pay at the machine.  And it was a tap. No idea why you would make your customers open an account to pay via phone when you have a tap machine.  We asked for water which we got tiny glasses of with no refills. And after we got our food,  there was no asking if we needed anything else, and we had to clean up our own dishes.  I felt like I was paying for a friggin summer camp experience.  We were both super disappointed.  Why open your restaurant to the public when you have no intention of serving them. I have been to around 20 restaurants and I have never seen such mismanaged bad service and COVID protical. Both servers who really didn't do anything and  looked like they hated being there.  Both of us had the falafel bowl which was tasty but was completely ruined by the atmosphere.  I haven't had such a bad experience in many years. I probably won't ever go back even when COVID is over. If you want a nice enjoyable experience stay clear of here.",

It had all my favorite ingredients: spinach, cheese, mushrooms, onions & tomatoes.\n\nThe prices are suspiciously cheap here. Less than $6 for a three-egg omelette not drowning in grease?!? It was a solidly good omelette. Not the fluffy kind with the ingredients tucked in; it was the scrambled then folded type of omelette (takes less skill to do those). Still it was really very good - again, not greasy, not dried out. It had an adequate amount of veggies so I left happy and ready to return.\n\nAmbulance has left a little something to be desired. It's just a plain 'ol mom n pop diner. Not much character or flare. I will say that they have kept the place up by accenting some walls with nice beige tile; so it's nicer looking than some other diners in St Pete.\n\nService was prompt and super friendly too.",

It happened to be a rainy Monday afternoon and we visited around 1 PM.  To my surprise, the line was only about 6 people deep.  Not too bad.  It went by pretty quickly.  So you get a menu and you order, pay, then seat yourself and one of the waitresses will come by to take your ticket.  Odd, but it works.  After hearing about how big the regular sizes of their po-boys were, my bf and I decided to share one, get a side of gumbo and a side of potato salad.  Gumbo was yummy and the sandwich was definitely enough to feed two.  We got the famous Ferdi Special and were satisfied.  All the waitresses there are so nice and I enjoyed being called \"sweet pea.\" Too bad they don't accept tips.",

  "text": "Despite the name, Stella is not traditional New Orleans cuisine. It is more of a gourmet experience with New Orleans overtones. \n\nMy wife and I had the risotto appetizer (extraordinary), fish and chips (deconstructed and put back together by a gourmet wizard), and lamb like no other I've ever had. For dessert we split a bananas foster French toast which was excellent. Our friends had some funky egg appetizer which my friend wasn't happy with, duck five ways and the fish and chips. They had another appetizer and dessert that I can't remember. \n\nThe araucana egg appetizer had some other kind of egg, not the blue egg that was supposed to come with it. In response to my friend's email, the owner said they had goofed up and apologized but didn't offer any sort of accommodation. \n\nThe ambience was nice but not overwhelming. The tables were far enough apart that we could talk. \n\nYes, the service is pretentious. Veddy pretentious. But I'd get a big head too if I were serving food this good. And they advised me not to wear a coat and tie when I called to make the reservation. Nor did the officious waitress flinch when we ordered beer instead of wine.",

  "text": "Recommended by the Marriott, where my parents were staying... dad was looking for a good Italian restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance in Cibo was great, especially the live music with the rotating servers singing! The food was standard Italian, but I don't think it was really anything special. Our server was not helpful at all when asking suggestions about wines and dishes. It would've been helpful to note that any dish not listed as pasta does not come with pasta. Most Italian restaurants, you assume pasta is the side. Not a big deal, I loved the sides, but it would've been nice to know ahead of time. \n\nA few minutes into our meal, my dad found a hair in his side dish and immediately brought it to the attention of our server. All the server did was take it away and offer him something else, to which my dad told him he had lost his appetite. And that was it, no further conversation about it whatsoever... no apology from a manager, nothing else to make it better... it was either get another meal or you're SOL for having a hair in your food.\n\nMy food was great, as was my stepmom's. I know stuff happens and sometimes you get a hair. The whole thing just seemed awkward and handled incorrectly. The food was good enough, but I probably won't be back due to the whole experience.",

  "text": "Pumpkin came highly recommended by many of my colleagues and Yelp Eliters, so my husband and I decided to give it a try for Restaurant Week Fall 2020! 3 courses for $35 for dinner. The menu always seemed a bit lackluster to us with relatively simple ingredients but assumed it was a more elevated cuisine. We were correct that it's definitely elevated but possibly just not a great fit for us. We like bold and elegant flavors, which we got from the sweet potato confit which was our  favorite part of the night. Every other part of our dinner was subpar. For our other appetizer we got the chickpea soup (chilled) - good fragrant spices but not enough bold flavor for us. Entrees were monkfish and shrimp & grits which was disappointing because the Instagram post with the restaurant week menu listed duck breast on the menu, but it was never corrected on Instagram or the website and only told once we were seated. I heard raving reviews about the duck breast and was genuinely disappointed we drove out to Rittenhouse from the Main Line and weren't able to try it. Dessert we got mint panna cotta and chocolate cake. My husband liked the mint Panna cotta but the texture just doesn't do it for me; the chocolate cake was dry and sauces were confusing. It tasted like hoisin sauce and cranberry sauce on the plate with a dry chocolate cake that was hard to swallow. Overall, pretty disappointing. The ingredients were all fresh but it did not live up to the hype. I was looking forward to this dinner all week, I guess these menu items were just not a great fit for us.",

  "text": "This review is from my July 2021 visit.\n\nIt wasn't a fun experience. \n\nWe went there on a whim ( we found a parking spot near by). \nService was borderline rude and very slow. Chips, which are NOT gratis, were stale, ice cold and  \"flat \". The salsa was tasteless there seemed to be absence of flavor in everything we ordered. I'd the beef el pastor burrito bowl. Meh, it was very rice centric! Pineapple Margaritas were too sweet - there was no pineapple flavor evident just sour mix. \n\nHere's the kicker our server added a 20% tip (for a party of 2)  but didn't tell us and there's no warning on the menu. When we asked him why he didn't tell us (after we left an additional 25% tip before realizing what he did) he said it was because of \"dine and dashers\". If someone is going to run out on the check they will also run out on the tip! So that's just not a cogent explanation! Frankly, i could see why you wouldnt want to tip there but dining and dashing is theft. Ironically we were the ones  left feeling ripped off for sure. Since it was my first meal out in 17 months I didn't want to deal with confronting the server but I'll never go back there again. \n\nThe overall experience was unpleasant. I have a hard time leaving less than 3 stars on any review but I won't be recommending this location. Evidently there are several in the area. \n\nSo, after all that we discovered it's a crappy chain joint to boot!",

  "text": "Thai Cafe is another of the 4 family-owned Thai establishments that populate the east end of the Loop.  Thai Cafe is located east of Skinker, across from The Pageant.\n\nTheir menu is similar to Thai Country and Thai Gai Yang, while the decor is more reminiscent of Thai Country.  The food is good, with huge portions and a good amount of spice delivered with the curries.\n\nOn a recent visit, it seemed as though they were short staffed because we only ever saw one waitress throughout the whole restaurant.  So while service was a little slow going, it was still good, as our drinks were refilled regularly, and our food didn't take forever to make it out of the kitchen.\n\nWhile I enjoyed Thai Cafe, I can only hope that on my next trip to St. Louis, Thai Country Cafe will be done with the remodeling and I can get my real STL Thai fix.",

  "text": "I like this place. I've never had chaat and so the first time I asked the guy who works there what chaat is. He said it is Indian street food and he described chaat was being something that is sweet and sour and tangy and spicy and and salty and excitement for your mouth. \n\nThat's pretty much correct. I've tried 3 different chaats. They were all called chaat, but they were all pretty different, so it's still not clear to me why all these things that are so different are all still called chaat, but that's the way it is. In any case, they were all very good. I especially like the Lamb Chaat. Another time I also tried the chicken biryani and that was pretty good (biryani is not chaat). And the samosas and lassi are also very good.\n\nI've been here about 3 times in the last 3 weeks, and I definitely plan on going back, and through campus food it looks like you can have your food delivered. \n\nFor those interested - here's a portion of what wikipedia says about chaat........ \n\nThe word derives from Hindi c  (tasting, a delicacy), from cn  (to lick), from Prakrit caei  (to devour with relish, eat noisily).[1]\n\nThe chaat variants are all based on fried dough, with various other ingredients. The original chaat is a mixture of potato pieces, crispy fried bread Dahi vada or Dahi Bhalla (\"Bhalla\" in Hindi), gram or chickpeas and tangy-salty spices, with sour home-made Indian chilli and Saunth (dried ginger and tamarind sauce), fresh green coriander leaves and yogurt for garnish, but other popular variants included Aloo tikkis (garnished with onion, coriander, hot spices and a dash of curd), bhel puri, dahi puri, panipuri, dahi vada, papri chaat, and sev puri.",

I wasn't really focusing on the names of the beer since I was on a date, sorry. :)\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of chatting and sipping our beer we decided to head upstairs so we could hear each other better. I think on a regular, no music day, sitting at the bar would be fine but they had a great singer/songwriter playing some tunes. \n\nWe moved upstairs where there were board games, a t.v with football playing, and, dun, dun, dun- A fooseball table! \n\nMy date and I were the only people upstairs so we played solo foose and had a blast. Afterwards we sat and chatted and drank a few beers and enjoyed the ability to have a conversation while still listening to the live music!\n\nI will go back more often now! The beertenders were very helpful, knowledgeable, and fun! \n\nTip: go check out the bathroom sinks, they are pretty cool.\n\nEnjoy!",

They offer happy hour menu everyday before 6pm and weekdays after 10pm, which takes a few dollars off most of the items on the menu. And their app, being the most useful restaurant app ever, you get 100 points straight after you sign up and you can already redeem the points for some free food :-) \nWe tried their shio ramen and beef sukiyaki bibimbap, tastes are ok but price is really cheap so no complaint. The bibimbap only has beef, no veggies at all, which is kind of weird... \nAs for grill, we got duck breast, beef tongues, beef toro, horumon, pork belly, kalbi chunks, and mushroom medley. The duck breast and beef tongues are my favorites, the cuts of pork belly and horumon definitely need some improvements though... \nThe experience to grill yourself was fun and the service was really nice. Also the price is much more friendlier than Korean bbqs, I hope they could open one in Baltimore!",

  "text": "Hovering between 3 and 4*. TLDR: Flatbeads and bison burger were good; the fish tacos should be renamed slaw tacos (at least on this particular visit). \n\n------------------------------------\n\nThe sister stopped by to visit us in Philly, so we rounded up the troops to grab some grub in the Fairmount area. I was told that Fare had bacon Bloody Mary's round the clock, regardless of whether they were serving brunch. And sure enough that's true.\n\nBut alas, they were somehow out of them when we stopped by. Not sure how that happens, but they did have food at least! There's a modern farmhouse-vibe of a bar to the left and to the right, there's plenty of seating for dining. \n\nFarmhouse Flatbread [$12]\nBacon, sharp cheddar, Granny Smith \n\nWe got the farmhouse flatbread to start. Sweet and savory elements were featured here. The crisp Granny Smith apples imparted some tart sweetness that was accented by the honey. This was balanced by the heft of the bacon and the sharpness of the cheddar. The crisp flatbread lent some nice texture to each bite. \n\nShort Rib Flatbread [$12]\nPort reduction, fig gorgonzola \n\nNot to be outdone, the short rib flatbread came with a foundation of savory short ribs, with a nice port reduction. The sweet figs were balanced by the funk of the gorgonzola and the peppery arugula, which was nicely seasoned. \n\nGreek Salad [$11] with Chicken [+ $4]\nTomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, olives, feta, red wine vinegar, EVOO\n\nWhile a bit of a small portion, all the standard flavors were there - the sharpness of the feta along with a melange of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and olives dressed in red wine vinegar and olive oil. The grilled chicken was moist and some lightly grilled bread accompanied the salad.\n\nFish Tacos [$13]\nCitrus slaw, black beans, brown rice\n\nThe fish tacos should have been renamed slaw tacos because clearly, the fish was not the star here as it only made a small appearance. The slaw had a nice citrusy brightness, but again - where was the fish? The stewed beans were nicely seasoned and some rice was studded with bits of carrot. Definitely a lighter option. \n \nBison Burger [$19]\nSpinach & feta bison burger, opened faced, lemon herb yogurt  \n\nI opted for the bison burger, which was served open faced. It was surprisingly moist and had traditional Greek flavors, with the herbs accented by the lemon-herb yogurt. The pickles were great and really shined - the slight sweetness balancing out the sour. The accompanying potatoes were nicely spiced and were creamy rather than crisp. The green beans had great snap, with a spritz of lemon providing some brightness.\n\nTruffle Fries [$8]\nTruffle oil, Parmesan cheese, chipotle aioli, salt\n\nWe also got a side of the truffle fries, which were perfectly crisp and had hints of truffle oil and salty Parmesan. It came with a pat of chipotle aioli.\n\nOverall, Fare is a decent option in the Fairmount area. Do try the flatbread and while the fish tacos were lacking, there aren't many places in Philly that can cook or even offer a decent bison burger.",

The tacos with beef or carne asada are a solid choice. Two tacos are great for a lunch portion. I usually skip the side of rice and beans. Also, I usually add cheese and jalapeño on my tacos, which I think is about .60 cents extra per taco. I'm all about upgrading for things like cheese and jalapenos, but wish at least that cheese was included. \n\nTaco Bus has some house made beverages, I've had them before and they are mostly good. The watermelon aqua fresca was a bit heavy and thick this time, so I would probably stick with a soft drink or horchata drink. The green and red sauces taco sauces they serve with the tacos really add to the flavor. Without the sauces I find the tacos a little bland., so be sure to sample some sauce. This is a nice place for lunch and the service is usually pretty quick. Just stick to basic tacos and you can't go wrong.",

GSR offered me a free buffet for two and gambling up to a $100.  Angie B and I headed to GSR on a Tuesday night to play and eat.  The line at 6 seemed long30 minutes, so we gambled for 45 minutes and came back to an even longer line. Oh well.  While in line an elderly woman had a medical emergency- I felt bad that they never moved her for privacy the entire time we were in line. \n\nNow the food, if that's what we are calling it. It was free, but still so very disappointing. So many fried choices that had been out awhile, were now dry and over crispy. The rare steak could have been good but so tough to cut and chew. AYCE shrimp was watery and soggy with very little taste. I didn't want to carb out so I didn't try the create your own pasta area. After two disappointing passes thru the buffet, I settled on the salad bar area that was brightly lit and full of fresher looking food. I did save some room for dessert. The chocolate items weren't really rich enough for me. I settled on some gelato that was ok. \n\nSafe to say I won't be returning.",

  "text": "Now if you're feeling only slightly peckish or looking for a light meal this is not the place for you - however, if you're looking for a hearty meal made with care then Meat delivers. Tucked just off Whyte Ave the restaurant is adorable with great decor and lots of communal tables with lots of room for your platters of food. I highly recommend coming with someone that you like sharing with so you can try a variety of meats with a few different sides. The brisket and pulled pork are delicious, especially when paired with their house-made BBQ sauces, make sure you sample them all! The sides are great, brustle sprouts, mac and cheese and cornbread are my recommendations. You'll be absolutely stuffed when you leave but it's totally worth it. A great menu of local beers helps wash everything down and should you happen to leave some room for dessert there are tasty options like a banana parfait or pecan pie.",

Yes, the prices are a bit higher but you do get what you pay for.  It's clean and the service is fairly fast and amenable.  The wait can be extremely long on Sunday during brunch hours, so I would suggest another time.  Since they are open 24 hrs., you do have a lot of other options.  The sandwiches there are pretty good and can last you for both lunch and dinner, should you grab one during break.  Probably my favorite diner in the area, although I must say that I do miss the now dearly departed Villanova Diner (oh the high school memories...).",

  "text": "Kansai is a local sushi restaurant that is literally half a block from our apartment. So it's pretty sad that it's taken so long to check it out. Either way, it's good to know if I want some decent nigiri or rolls, they're just a few steps away.\n\nFirst thing's first - Kansai is a Philly-friendly BYO! So the GF and I brought over a Junmai Nigori sake to start off our night right before seeing Aziz Ansari at Wells Fargo. This was a lusciously floral libation - easy drinking to be sure. So be warned, you'll find yourself knocking them back and stumble out the door. \n\nSalad\nGinger dressing\n\nThis came as part of the sushi regular appetizer and offered a fresh and crisp mix of lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber with that ubiquitous, yet addictive ginger dressing. \n\nSpicy Tuna Tartare [$7.95]\n\nI appreciated that the tartare wasn't obliterated beyond belief and that there were distinct pieces of tuna interspersed throughout this chili and ponzu-spiced melange. Accents of tobiko were a nice textural pop to each bite. Pretty standard, but well executed. \n\nVegetable Tempura [$7.50]\n\nThe tempura were expertly fried - eggplant, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and squash were offered - each with a crisp, crunchy exterior that lent itself to tenderness within. \n\nSushi Regular [$17.25]\n\nThe regular sushi appetizer brought forth a classic quartet of nigiri including 2 each of salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and striped bass. Decent - the sushi was fresh and the quality was on par with a non-omakase sushi experience. A California roll was included as well.\n\nSweet Potato Roll [$3.95]\nSpicy Salmon Roll [$5.25]\nYellowtail Scallion Roll [$4.95]\n\nThe yellowtail scallion wasn't exactly revelatory, but I appreciated that the spicy salmon roll offered substantial pieces of salmon, instead of a pureed blend of spice and salmon leftovers. The sweet potato roll was also one of the better iterations I've had - huge chunks housed in a crisp shell. \n\nSo if you're in the Fairmount area, you've certainly got a few options including the venerated Umai Umai and Doma Sushi. But if you're looking for a relaxed BYO environment with fresh, decent quality sushi, Kansai has got you covered. Better yet - while they take credit cards, cash is king and they offer discounts for those who bite.",

When the place is packed I can understand why the volume needs to be loud, however, it was practically empty yet the TV volume was full blast. It made it hard to have a conversation. We asked our server to lower the volume and she did but, it didn't make a difference. \n\nService was very good. They have a hot and ready policy. As soon as anything you order is ready, its brought to your table. Onion rings, wings, fries and chicken fingers were decent. Both their buffalo and garlic sauce were really just average. My brisket sandwich was not great. It was much spicier than expected and the meat was mostly gristle.  I did not enjoy it.\n\nIt's obvious this restaurant is best for people who want to eat wings, drink beer and watch football. They don't have much else to offer",

  "text": "Blaze pizza has opened from California bringing the Subway concept to New Orleans. You walk in pick what crust you want and then proceed to choose what toppings you want from an abundant selection of meat and vegetable toppings. Its almost the Kramer concept from Seinfeld where you build your own pie. Once you've created your 12\" masterpiece it bakes for 7 minutes and boom you have a pizza. At $7.95 you can't beat the price and they are big enough for two people. The drinks are great too as they have a blood orange lemonade that is excellent. I highly recommend this place especially if your on a budget. Only drawback is that because the ingredients are so fresh your pizza will be a little wet as 7 minutes is not enough time to burn off the condensation so the pizza is a little sloppy depending on how many ingredients you put on it.",

I will mention just a couple things that bothered me in particular.  I went to see a certain team play on Sunday and there must have been 30 screens.  My team was only playing on 2 of them and neither of them were at the bar.  There was an hour wait for a table and I wouldn't have necessarily seen either screen from the table I might have received.  The same game was playing on both of the jumbo screens..... stupid.  You can't see more than one screen at any one bar seat.  The screens should have been bigger so if you were lucky to get a seat you probably couldn't have seen the game you wanted anyway.

  "text": "PREFACE: I started the draft of this review back in January, the first time I went to Mannings.  SInce then I have been back twice, so I will note in the review.\n\n1st visit-Have never been here before, because most sports bars are over-rated (think BWW).  But I was downtown on a staycation and wanted to try it out.  I sat myself at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and some wings.  It was around lunch time, but surprisingly quiet in there.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  Lots of screens, I could see why this place would be a hit during sports events.  \n\n2nd visit (KENTUCKY DERBY) there was an event going on in Fulton Alley for Kentucky Derby, so hubs and I wandered in to watch the race.  It was packed (which I have come to learn is the norm more than the exception).  The only thing we had was a shot, and it was a drink.  The thing I like is that even though the patrons seem to mainly be tourist/visitors, they are always really friendly.  I love a bar where everyone is interacting, talking smack, and looking like they are having a good time.\n\n3rd visit (FOOTBALL SEASON/STEELERS GAME)-We were so foolish.  I knew there would be a wait to get a table, so we decided to arrive 1 hour before kickoff.  WRONG.  There was a 2 hour wait for an inside table.  We were actually able to quickly locate seating outside but the game we wanted to see wasn't on so we left.  It was crowded.  \n\nOverall, I will continue to return to Mannings in hopes we can get a table and order several items so I can give a follow up review.  It's big and clean and has a good atmosphere so I hope to be able to write a follow up with pictures and feedback on the service.",

  "text": "The concept of this restaurant is spot-on... but the selection wasn't particularly exciting. The antipasti was a true Italian antipasti -- an array of meats and cheeses. But I think there was only one kind of cheese, definitely an array of meats, but no introduction upon delivery. While sitting at the chef's counter, the IDEA is to have a conversation about your food/wine with. The most I got out of our guy was that he didn't like Italian wine (hi, you work at an Italian restaurant...what do you mean you don't like Barolos?) I will say though, the lamb was really well prepared. It had a honey walnut sauce, which was delicious paired with the lamb and its tangy goat cheese. The bisteca, not as exciting -- but hey, now you know.\n\nMaybe with a few FOB Italians behind the counter this place could be amazing, but for now it's just okay.",

  "text": "Kuma's Corner is truly a little gem on the corner in Fountain Square. With the endless amount of burgers and great atmosphere, Kuma's Corner is the perfect spot to eat with friends and family. \n\nIt was hard for me to choose which burger to get because they had such a variety of great options with a lot of fun ingredients. I decided on the \"Led Zeppelin\" burger, which had bacon, BBQ pulled pork, pickles, and sharp cheddar, with a side of fries. Every bite was incredible. I was glad that I was too full to finish it because that meant that I could take it home and enjoy it the next day!\n\nIf the weather is nice, sit outside on their patio. Since it is located on the corner of Fountain Square, it is a fun atmosphere to eat and chat with friends and do some people watching ;)\n\n2 cool things about Kuma: I found on their website that they have a charity of the month. If you ask the server what the charity is, you can help donate to the cause. Also, they only support purveyors that are local and homegrown, which means that they don't carry any Miller High Life or Budweiser. Yay local!\n\nI will definitely be coming back here with new friends! Everyone needs to try this great place on the corner!",

  "text": "I came here with my boyfriend for a date night out and it did not disappoint! We waited almost an hour which is to be expected on a Saturday night. We sat outside in a perfect little corner for us and it was so great! We ordered the bacon wrapped stuffed shrimp and we almost had a heart attack. Those little suckers are so damn delicious! The sweet chili sauce paired so well with them and the shrimps were huge and stuffed with warm feta cheese. I could have eaten 5 of those by myself! We then ordered two salads to go with our steak and scallop dishes. I had the rib-eye and my boyfriend had the scallops and we shared both of our dishes for a great surf and turf meal. They were both top-notch! The scallops were not anything like we had before -- thick and meaty with bacon and covered in a tangy sauce that was divine. My steak was off the charts and I had it come with the rosemary blue cheese sauce and it almost knocked my boyfriend out of his seat. SO GOOD! The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a great compliment to it. For dessert we shared an adult hot chocolate with the peanut butter pie. It was so sweet and decadent but it was worth getting stuffed over. All in all, the food and service was very good. They did not rush us out which we GREATLY appreciated. We were one of the last 3 couples having dinner and just taking our time. We were originally going to have dinner at either Oku or Bluewater but we are so happy that we came across Holdren's and happy we spent such a great evening here!",

Haven't had kimchi that good other than at 1-2 places in the PalPark/Ft.Lee/Leonia area of Bergen County, NJ lol.\n\nCame here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. That H-Mart next door is always packed so don't even bother parking in the H-Mart lot. Actually this complex has their own parking lot separate from the H-Mart parking lot but you have to exit first. \n\nIt wasn't all that busy and we got seated right away. The first thing I noticed was the children playroom. Super adorable and this is definitely a good place to come with kids. \n\nOrdered the extra spicy curry sundubu because I was a little adventurous. I have to say not again, I'd rather stick with my favorite red-broths sundubus. Other than the typical sundubu options, they also have the budae jiggae sundubu. I was like whattt, that's like a dream come true lol. Typically you either have budae jiggae OR sundubu but not both in one bowl haha. Also ordered the spicy gejang which was pretty good. The banchans were standard, but the kimchi made all the difference. We had 2nd and 3rd on the kimchi lol.\n\nService is very quick and friendly. Definitely one of the sundubu places I'll come back too.",

They serve a variety of noodle dishes - only one of which is actually ramen. The miso ramen was good, but I probably wouldn't come back to Cheu for it. I'd definitely return to explore some of the other items on the menu, like the black garlic wings and the coconut curry noodles.\n\nI also had the pork belly bun, which was really... crispy. I'm really partial to the traditional soft white buns and the buns at Cheu taste more like a fried biscuit. I thought the filling could have more flavor too - the pickles were a bit bland and the sauce felt like an afterthought.",

  "text": "Back again, why, because there is no other Indian restaurant like Guru. (Not even back in Secaucus NJ where we used to dine on really good Indian food from different regions of India.)\n\nThe passion of this husband and wife team are incredible, they both share a passion for creating great flavors and for making their guests happy. Per their bio, \"we aim to cater to the sophisticated palates of our friends and neighbors in Bucks county\" and that they do.\n\nWe are still newbies here but have dined at least 6 times in such a short period.  Simply because they make us feel as though we are family.  Best part for us is that we've connected with Preya (Ashni's spouse) and she totally understands us and our palates.  No more opening of menus for us, she just brings us what she thinks we'd love based on how we feel and our spirits.\n\nWe were so lucky to again be able to sample a few more new summer  items before they hit the menu.  Ashni Kumar Guru is indeed a master chef. I was feeling blase today so to help give me Preya surprised me with their version of chicken soup; not just any chicken soup.  Was incredible, just the right touch of spice and magic flavor that I felt so lifted afterwards.\n\nFor our second course, we were served a new shrimp appetizer with a sauce mixture featuring mangoes (we Iove mangoes), this is based on their garlic shrimp, I think even better. \n\nNext, my wife had wanted their lamb chops where were cooked to perfection without us even asking---- medium raw, was able to cut it with just a fork.... so tender and accented by the dipping sauce.\n\nNext we shared chicken methi  (chicken cubes cooked with fresh fenugreek leaves flavored with herbs and spices); a home run flavor.\n\nLastly, I gave in to trying paneer with their delicious Palak Paneer disk (Homemade Indian cheese cooked with spinach, mild spices and herbs.)  Loved it.\n\nTo finish off the meal, Kheer , a traditional firm rice and milk pudding with aromatic spices. a nice slightly sweet finish to an excellent meal.\n\nBTW, there was plenty for a second meal.  Just nice to taste a range of flavors.",

  "text": "It seems like so many of us yelpers were at this location. Why not?! The food is delicious. The quantity is filling. And, the price is affordable. \n\nSo a bunch of us Elites got together to try another new Chinese place in town but it seems like they ran out of steam and could not be open for normal operating hours. Their loss because we landed at Meet Noodles. It was an ideal day for Noodle Soup. \n\nWe got the Zhou's beef noodles. We were recommended regular and they gave the extra chili sauce on the side if we wanted to make the soup spicier. The broth was delicious, the beef slices were generous and the noodles were plenty. The noodles were el dante. I know el dante applies to pasta, but I don't know how else to describe it. It was chewy, which is a great texture as it didn't get soft and mushy while soaking in the broth. Although, next time I am getting medium. I think I can handle the heat. \n\nThe basil fried chicken is plenty and amazing. It's actually tasted like karaage, japanese fried chicken,  and was very enjoyable. Highly recommend it for sharing. \n\nWe also ordered the Takoyaki! Order this. It's so good! It explodes in your mouth with rich creamy texture and is made of a mix of fish. \n\nWe also got the honey lemon tea and the cheese milk foam, peach oolong. I found the former too sweet but the latter was such a new and pleasant drink. It may not be a crowd pleaser like the boba tea but it's worth trying. Looks like beer but once you drink it the foam is a salty and creamy followed by the sweetness of peach oolong ice tea. I actually really enjoyed this and recommend. Don't let the unknown deter you! \n\nSo we all sat for four hours post lunch and chatted away in our booth and I really appreciate that they did not rush us out. They let us be. In fact, they also got us pumpkin cakes to write reviews, they were so nice and kind about it. \n\nThey had a new staff on training and that's where I knocked off the star. We got lemonade at first instead of water, but they were really nice about it and got us our waters later and didn't charge us thankfully. And, then while someone was there to explain us what to get as we sought recommendations, our friend didn't get the same advice so ended up with a spicy bowl of soup. When I asked if there was anything we could do about it, the lady said I like to talk so I mentioned that to you. Granted they were busy and it was what was ordered but a consideration would have been appreciated, I guess? \n\nThey are new and gaining popularity so will need to iron those kinks out. We are glad there is such an affordable and delicious place in town and they are very nice people so will certainly be back. I hope the quality continues to deliver and the service gets better with time.",

I went with the extra meat on the Rueben, which probably was not necessary.  The craft beer selection is phenomenal.  The list is huge for both draught and bottle and they focus a lot on local breweries.  They also just started to brew their own beer in house.  I can't wait to go back.",

The seats are very close to one another and there is not much leg room but luckily I'm short and it doesn't bother me too much. Downstairs the theatre was selling \"In the Heights\" swag along with jewelry (I know, a little odd). Upstairs there are tons of old pictures lining the hallways of former stars who have performed at the Walnut. \n\nThe service was okay.. I didn't order any food or drinks because I had just eaten dinner nearby. When I walked into the theatre itself, there was no one handing out the playbill..I had to retrieve it myself. I miss seeing a beautiful chandelier like the one displayed at the Forrest Theatre. \n\nWill I return to the Walnut? Sure! But I have to say nothing beats seeing a show on Broadway..

  "text": "Those who lie in South Jersey will know, Olga's Diner used to be one of the most famous and popular diners in the area. It closed in 2008 and before I moved here. \n\nA year ago, a new family decided to recreate Olga's Diner right up the road on route 73. It wasn't the original family or original building, but the name Olgas.  When it finally opened in November of 2019, I was excited to go!\n\nI met up around lunchtime on a weekday. It was packed! You would think we were going on a busy Sunday morning.\n\nOlga's Diner Atmosphere: \nOlga's Diner stands out on route 73. It's hard to miss the big, shiny, modern building. The inside of Olga's Diner is large. Each booth and table is spread out, so you don't feel like you're sitting on top of anyone.\n\nCoffee: \nThe coffee at Olga's Diner is good. Olga's Diner uses the local company, Lacas. I could have used a few more refills.\n\nOlga's Diner Food: \nOlga's Diner menu has everything you want and need in a diner.  There are plenty of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. If you are looking for healthy options, Olga's Diner has that too. Plus an entire page menu dedicated to vegan options. Yes, vegan!  I thought about getting a vegan option just because Olga's Diner had it but ultimately decided for the beet salad with rotisserie chicken. If beets are on any restaurant menu, I usually order them.\n\nThe beets tasted good and the greens were fresh. There was plenty of chicken too. I couldn't taste a difference in the rotisserie-style chicken versus grilled.\n\nOlga's Diner Dessert: \nCyd mentioned the original Olga's Diner was known for their Boston Cream Pie, so we both decided to order that. The Boston Cream Pie was good, but the cake portion of it was a little dry.\n\nOlga's Diner Service: \nThe waitress said it was her first day, but you would not have guessed. She was friendly and seemed like she was working there for a long time. The food came out quickly. We were sat and eating our food within 15 minutes of arriving.\n\nCost: $$\nFor my coffee, salad, and pie, it was $25. The salad alone was nearly $19, which I found a bit pricey for the size.\n\nOverall Thoughts/Would I Come Back?\nI liked Olga's Diner, and I'll be back. The food was excellent, and Olga's Diner has a lot of menu options I want to try.",

  "text": "My friend and I went to Wild Wing before going to a football game (wings and football seems like an appropriate combo). While there are other items on the menu we went for the wings. My friend doesn't like wet (sauced) wings, so we learned that the chip flavours and the favours in the naked category were the dry (spice rub) wings. There's a lot of flavours of wings (heard 101, but I didn't count), so like another reviewer I saw mentioned don't just come and get the standard hot sauce or BBQ. Even my friend regularly goes for dill pickle wings, but I convinced her to try something new. I got the thai and raspberry flavour in the boneless (aka chicken nugget) wings, and it was good combo of spicy and sweet. The wings (least the boneless ones) were delicious - juicy, but not greasy. \n\nThe price is a bit high - $10.95 for one flavour of wings. You could pay like $21 for 2 flavours, but I didn't see any sort of wing deals (although I didn't really check the rest of the menu). Still the wings are good, and I didn't leave the restaurant hungry. Our server was really friendly and helpful answer questions about the menu. Oh and you get this giant wet nap with the wings instead of a bunch of little ones. Wild Wing is a bit out of the way from me, but I'd certainly come back and try it again. The hot chocolate flavour sounded kind of interesting.",

It's close, the food is great, and outdoor seating is perfect to bring fussy babies when the weather is nice. Ok, fussy baby, singular, my friend's baby was a perfect angel laying in his stroller for most of the meal. Mine had to be walked around the outdoor area by one parent for almost the entire time. So, five stars for that outside seating area. \n\nI got the Ahi Tuna Salad and my husband got the BeerBQ pizza. Both were amazing. When we got home I was dropping the food in the fridge before going out and I ate one of his pieces before returning to the car. It is that good. The cheese is baked to a crisp on the crust and the sauce is deliciously sweet. The Ahi Tuna Salad is delicious as well. It probably isn't the healthiest salad in the world with the heaping of fried won ton strips, but you only live once and I still felt healthy(ish) eating it. \n\nService was definitely slow. When my baby was losing It because of nap time I would have appreciated if our server had a little more pep to her step, but I bet everyone else was here for a lazy meal. Just don't expect to get in and out if you sit outside on a Sunday. I also think most people come here to watch a game, so they aren't looking for efficient service.",

No, its not In-n-Out, for those who have experiences it, but they aren't bad burgers at all, and are inexpensive and taste so much better than anything at other fast food restaurants.  You can find them sprinkled all over town, and they offer the same fast and friendly service.  You can decide what you want or don't want on your burger and BOOM its done.  Have it your way but a whole lot less gross.  A clean, almost clinical eating space but this isn't the kind of place where you linger.  However, if you want a fast burger, I would recommend this over a McDonalds or Wendy's anyday.",

So I found this lady title gem instead I mean little octopus is swimming by next to many big & famous fish in the restaurants ocean. \n\nI ordered \"Shrimp & Grits\"  with pan-fried country ham XO & bell pepper.  It's delicious, but it a bit too salty for me. You can see a pile of oil floating on top of grits. Maybe chef can reduce the sauce by 1/3 or add more grits, then the dish will be more balanced. The country ham perfectly cooked to reduction with all the favor and crunchiness. It's definitely a new approach to the traditional Shrimp & Grits. \n\nCachapas~ this is the best dish among all dishes on the menu IMO. I said oh wow Ike three times when I'm eating this. It's fresh corn pancake with quest fresco in between pancake and top with fried egg. It has great savory flavor and the tastes of corn meal. Perfect meal for a weekend brunch. \n\nPot de cream~ it's has a great coconut lightness taste with strong ginger & chocolate flavor and top with pistachio. Not very sweet. It was just an above average desert for me. \n\nThis restaurant just open 7 months, but it gives Nashville local food an interesting approach. The Caribbean influence is a welcome change from many of the restaurants here.  The chef is creative and experimenting with new ingredients. Definitely a fun try after all the greasy & fried food I had in the past couple days. \n\nAlthough it has a fine dining decor into it, but the atmosphere is causal. Most people has shorts/sandals/slippers on them, probably are all tourists like me. I love the golden hues in the mirrors and the bright light from the skylights.   When I come back I will try and score a seat at the display kitchen so I can watch the chefs work.",

My friend and I tried the first three.  The duck wings were crispy and had a great flavor, although there was very little meat on them, and it was $12 for 3 wings. The fries were good.

At any rate, I am doing an injustice if I don't report how lovely this restaurant is. It's one of my new favorites...Shhhhhhh!!!!!\nBeautiful decor, they've done an excellent job with the old Rusan's footprint. \nThe Pussers rum painkiller is the bomb. Love it! They have excellent drinks all around. \nNow this is a tapas type place perfect for sharing. Some things were so good we ordered two, like the hamachi. DAYUM this stuff is good.\nAvocado. So simple and SO FRIKKIN good. They rotate the menu so I pray they don't change those two things. Cornbread was a tad sweet, but perfect golden crust in a cast iron skillet. Empanadas were my least favorite, at the time it was filled with chicken curry, but they change all the time. We had something with sweet potato that has since been changed, along with potatoes that were tasty. Nothing was bad, it's all so great. We had phenomenal service, too.

I picked this tour group because they run small business (15 ppl max). My tour guide, Dionne, arrived right on time at my hotel for pick up. She had other guests to pick up from 3-4 other hotels and we were on our way within 30 minutes. With everyone onboard Dionne started the tour. She pointed out interesting locations and facts about New Orleans that I would not have known. She was funny and factual -- making for an excellent tour. The trip to the plantations is about an hour. Dionne talked for about 30 minutes, a healthy mix. She pointed on the house where D'jango Unchained was filmed and stopped so that we could take pictures. NLT provides access to three plantations-- The Whitney, The Laura, and Oak Alley -- listed in order of drop off. From there guests pick up a guided tour of the plantation. I liked NLT because they allowed some downtime at the plantations for shopping and browsing-- but not too much time. A great tour company.",

This was one of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had and would be probably #2 on my list next to Joe's Steak (formerly Chink's and see my review!). Right amount of meat, cheese, and onions and shrooms. A little too much on the sweet peppers for me, but the roll kicked major butt. What a great combo to make an awesome sandwich. Had some fries and they got a little soggy back to the office, but still quite tasty.\n\nSonny's has plain, loaded (which is what I had and took a picture), bacon, hoagie with lettuce/tomato/red onion/mayo, pizza steak, and pepperoni cheesesteak. They also sell the right sides like fries of all sorts, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks. But, there's more! You can get burgers and, get this, grilled cheese in multiple styles!\n\nIn these COVID-19 times, they are limiting the numbers in the store, everyone wears masks, and you have to go outside to wait for your order until they call your number. There's also about four metal tables to sit at to eat if you wish outside. \n\nOverall, definitely five stars for this awesome cheesesteak. No peppers next time for me.\n\n$12 for the ultimate cheesesteak, $10 for the plain, and $3 for fries. Not bad at all.",

They are also cheaper. While the options aren't quite as adventurous, they have what they do perfected and you aren't going to get something that will disappoint. \n\nThis location, as mentioned earlier, is out of the way from most things in town. It's not somewhere I ever find myself going for a walk or bike ride, or even passing on my way somewhere, but it is worth the short detour from downtown. Their building is a little older and what might have been and old residence. As far as I can tell, there is no actual parking lot, but the street it is on has parking on both sides and you can usually find something without too much difficulty.\n\nIf you go during any of the busier hours, the line will certainly be out the door and down the sidewalk. That being said, they do a pretty good job of keeping things moving quickly so it isn't as long a wait as it might appear. They have an old menu inside on the wall that has the prices of their different options. You can call ahead and put in an order if you have a bigger one, and then cut to the pickup window to get in and out quickly.\n\nAlthough it's commonly referred to Long's donuts, it's actually Long's Bakery and they do have a wide variety of items. While donuts are certainly what they are most known for, they also have cakes, pies, muffins, brownies, cookies, and a wide variety of other baked sweets. Along with that, I know that they also have milk and OJ to round out the morning refreshments. I know it's fairly hard to mess up something that is full of sugar and fried, but everything I have had has been delicious. \n\nCASH ONLY!!",

Had a nice sweet and refreshing taste.\n\n*PINA COLADA ($7) - I like them strong, so it was a bit on the weaker side. I also like a coconut  and pineapple POW, which it lacked.\n\nThe menu looked interesting, but we didn't order any food items.\n\nNext time, I will need to check out the much referenced $3 mojitos instead.\n\nNot the best place on Magazine for drinks, but it got the job done at 4PM on a weekday.",

Carne asada, lengua, chicken, carnitas, and el pastor... it's all consistently delicious. My husband and I typically order a mixture of different tacos and then share them between the two of us; this is a great way to try a little bit of everything and not fill up on one thing. We've had other things here too, but the tacos are just so dang delicious that I go back to ordering them time and time again. \n\nThis restaurant is always packed and it's not uncommon for the line to be almost out the door around lunch hour or when downtown Reno has street activities going on. If you're not planning to sit down and eat in the restaurant they typically have a takeout line to the side that you can order from. Regardless, it's worth the wait if you have the time. I only wish they had additional locations.",

The service is usually very quick (they are usually trying to get people in and out because it does get extremely busy at times) but the flavor of the pho is so delicious. When I come I usually get the rare steak pho bowl in a large. The portions are pretty big so if you don't finish - which I usually don't - this is enough food for you to be able to take home with you for a second meal!\n\nI have had their potstickers and spring rolls before as well, which I didn't really like as much. However I have tried some of their fried rice and entree dishes as well which are really good! \n\nThere's no doubt that I will continue to come to Golden Flower whenever I am craving pho!",

Breakfast on the other hand...not so much.\n\nFirst, there is literally not one healthy thing on the breakfast menu. Sure, you can get yogurt - the full sugar kind topped with gloopy pie filling \"fruit\". And you could get oatmeal - but it's the presweetened instant varety that tastes like fake maple & shame. I know, I know...what can a person expect when everything on the menu is $6 or less? If you want all the pancakes you can cram into your pancake hole, its just $3 so there is that.\n\nI can take marginally bad food because SNS is what it is, but the service here was bad, bad, bad. There was one table in the place and we had to wait 5 minutes at the desk to be acknowledged and another 10 minutes before our server actually stopped by. Appears we interrupted \"co-worker story time\".\n\nOne further note - the restaurant was very, very dirty when we visited. Our table was greasy, the menus were sticky and the bathrooms are...gross. I'm going to leave it at that because to describe what I saw in there goes beyond the boundaries of good taste. All I can say is that there are some seriously dirty bitches in St. Louis.",

Everything ran for about $3.75-4.00 for nigiri sushi and the quality of the ones that I ordered were not very good.. The hamachi color looked a bit off like it was old or something and they give you the thinnest slice of fish ever! The unagi and masago were okay but nothing special.. My friend ordered the teriyaki dinner and it was the saddest thing I've ever seen.. They basically give you salad, white rice, and chopped up bits of chicken on a plate.. The pieces were cut up so small it looked like baby food and you could tell that they didn't just grill up a piece of chicken, dice it, and sauce it.. They literally cooked it in bits.. Ick! From previous experience my friend told me they used to serve it as strips of chicken breast and the taste this time was just alright compared to before they changed ownership.. I will definitely not be returning here and I still stand behind my number one spot for sushi in Tucson, Sushi Garden! It should've been a dead give away when there was only one other group in the restaurant during the dinner rush..",

Tonight I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered a Gyro Salad. It was a large and I do mean large Greek Salad. It was a hearty portion of lettuce, cucumber, tomato, red onion, green pepper, kalamatra olives, crumbled feta cheese, tossed in their house made dressing and topped with gyro meat. It was a low-carb friendly meal in a bowl. It was served with toasted pita bread, for those who are not eating low-carb. The meat was tender and tossed in the perfect amount of dressing. This was one of the better Greek Salads I've had with Gyro meat. \n\nApollonia has a great location, it is just half a block from the intersection of Gravois & Loughborough. If you do not nab one of the prime parking spots on Gravois in front, don't worry there is a prime parking lot behind the restaurant with a walkway directly to the front entrance.\n\nThe service was a little slow, I think our server was overwhelmed with a party of twelve.

We basically had the place to ourselves and the food came out quickly.  \n\nThey have half off apps and drinks - so nice cocktails were just $4.50 and $3 beer.  \nBetween the three of us we had four apps which was more than enough.  We were very full and happy with the food.  The price was fab - only $12 per person with tax and tip.  Can't beat that.\n\nWe tried the vegetarian samosas - they serve only two, so if you have a bigger group you might want to order more than one set.  They had a nice crispy shell, and the traditional potato and pea filling was really soft, smooth and flavorful.  The samosas themselves were really big and filling.  However, they weren't anything special in my opinion.  \n\nWe also had the cauliflower covered in some sort of dough, which was my favorite.  I'm kicking myself for not taking pictures, but once we started eating there was no stopping for photos!  Soft, cooked to perfection and not too much dough.  \n\nWe sampled the Aloo Papri Chaat, which was lentil wafers on the bottom, covered with potatoes, chick peas and yogurt.  SO good!  My favorite app by far.  It had all the right spices, and was a fresh dish I had never tried before.  Highly recommend it!\n\nWe also tried the lamb and chicken kabob.  It was definitely interesting.  It was lamb on the inside with chicken around it, kind of in the form of a sausage.  It was a lot of meat, so I'm glad we paired it with veggies.  I thought this was the least exciting app, but I'm glad we tried it.  \n\nOverall, good service, good food, and a good price.  However, in my opinion nothing special.  I wasn't really thinking about the food afterwards, but I'd return for a happy hour for sure.",

If I was the decorator I would do the easy thing and put som string lights up, would make it look much better\n\nWe had a pizza which was truly fantastic and the chicken Parmesan was really good as well. We ended the dinner with a Cheesecake served without silverware, we got spoons after asking... The Cheescake was kind of sweaty and like the calamari just blend, I would not order that again. I wanted some coffee too but the Espresso machine was not warmed up for some reason, so that did not happen.\n\nOur server Matt was working his third day and he was super, I hope he is still there. He was really trying hard and made our visit better with his great attitude.",

  "text": "When you enter into Bareburger, you feel as though Brooklyn came up and spat into Philly. And lo and behold, BareBurger began in a now-defunct bar from your favorite hipster borough in NY. Since then, it's expanded beyond the Tri-State region, with 23 franchises and counting.\n\nBareburger is all about being as organic, lean, and as pasture-raised as can be. Regular readers know I'm all about 80/20 cuts, if not fattier. But sometimes you just need to branch out and see what else is out there in the burger world. And much to the joy of the GF, we stopped by one weekend afternoon.\n\nThe Standard [$9.85]\nBeef Sweet and wild rice, stout onions, dill pickles, special sauce, brioche bun\n\nThe GF went with the standard, but subbed the beef for the vegan sweet and wild rice patty. This features a nicely crisp exterior, with a hearty melange within. The stout onions imparted some savory heft, with the dill pickles providing some acidic crunch. The bun to \"meat\" ratio was on point.\n\nBlue Elk [$12.15]\nElk, Amish Blue cheese, country bacon, stout onions, tomato fig jam, sprout bun\n\nI love that Bareburger offers your not-so-typical protein options. I went with the elk, which is all-natural, pasture-raised, hormone-free, antibiotic-free, and 90% lean. All the stuff I frankly care less about than taste. But the taste was tantalizing indeed! Definitely not gamey, and featuring a slightly sweeter flavor than beef, the elk patty was well-seasoned and moist. The country bacon was crisp, but substantial and provided some salty savoriness to each bite. The Amish blue cheese provided creamy funk, with the stout onions providing depth. The balance with the fig jam was really nice as well. Delicious.\n \nLarge Rings & Fries [$8.95]\nSmoke sauce, special sauce, habanero mayo, curry ginger ketchup  \n\nWe obviously had to try their rings and fries combo. The onion rings were well-seasoned, with great crunch. The fries were disappointing though, limp and almost to the point of being wet. Getting the large portion of this side nets you 4 dippers. The special sauce is what gets standardly dressed on most of the burgers here. The curry ginger had nice depth to it, while the habanero mayo had a light kick. The smoke sauce was essentially a smoky BBQ sauce. Definitely a filling side for less than $9.\n\nWith the exception of the limp fries, BareBurger hit it out of the park for me, especially considering its focus on the leaner cuts and the organic lifestyle. And while Bareburger Philly is casual, do note that if you're dining in, you don't order at the counter as servers are there to take your order at the table. Somewhat surprising for a burger joint. The menu extends far beyond just burgers, with shakes and cocktails on offer as well. Be sure to stop in for brunch which features everyone's favorite - chicken and waffles.",

  "text": "Booked the Grill Room for a Thanksgiving meal, prefixed menu, which looked great.  Food was pretty good but not exceptional.  Service was lacking as was the holiday atmosphere.  Kind of felt like a regular meal at the Grill Room, only the service wasn't any good.\n\nFirst the food.  The crab au gratin was awesome.  Butter based sauce with lots of jumbo lump crabmeat.  Next I had the grilled sweet potato soup.  Bacon and parmesan was mixed in.  Kind of dull base flavor although it did taste like sweet potato.  The bacon provided the needed savoriness.  I'd say it was a 3/5.  I had the beef tenderloin and my girlfriend got the turkey.  Both were ok.  Turkey was about a 3/5 as was the tenderloin.  Tenderloin seasoning was just a few flakes of sea salt.  Dessert was a bust for me.  The chocolate mousse was a 2/5.  Great presentation but uninspired taste.  Tasted like chocolate soft serve.\n\nThe Windsor Court was decorated for Christmas with their lobby looking very plush.  The Grill Room didn't do a lot to participate in the festivities.  Not sure what I expected, but it was more than what I got.  \n\nThe service was subpar.  We were seated right away, but it was 10 minutes before our waiter came over for the brief intro and water.  Then it was another 20 before we ordered dinner.  When Jason (who was actually a nice dude) did take our order, I asked that he get some bread over quick, or I was about to start eating the food off our neighbors plates.  It was prefixed, so the food rolled out in a timely fashion. The server bringing out the plates continually mixed me and my girlfriend's dishes up.  A trivial nuisance but made the meal feel like amateur hour.  \n\nI usually don't complain about price in my reviews.  Meals cost what the menu says and are usually available for review.  I knew the prefix menu ahead of time and was ok with it.  It was the 22% gratuity which I found irritating given the poor service.  However, I understand it's tough finding someone to wait tables on Thanksgiving.\n\nIn summary, the food was around a 3/5.  Service brought the overall experience down to a 2/5.  I doubt I will repeat.",

  "text": "I left Cheu with a bad taste in my mouth, though I can't say it's the fault of the ramen. Dealing with an unexpectedly warm October evening, our initial plans of \"warming up with some yummy broth\" were not necessary, but we had a craving, and the only thing that could sate my buddy and I was ca-noodling at Cheu. We strolled in around 7:20 and the place was nowhere close to full. There were about 3 people at the bar and two sitting down, so we were immediately seated at the window. The inside of Cheu is warm and welcoming, the chalkboard showing off the daily specials (tea, beers, food, etc). A carafe of ice water was brought to our table, menus placed in front of us, and we were excited for a night out.\n\nCue when things took a turn for the questionable. I'm not sure if this is standard fare for Cheu, or just due to being a little bare bones, but we had two servers visiting our table periodically. I initially thought maybe one would just be to refresh our water, but they (a man and a woman) would follow after the other often less than a minute behind, asking the same questions. \n\n\"Have you decided on a drink?\" ..... \"Can I get you ladies some drinks?\"\n\nWait. Didn't I just tell that guy we weren't ready yet?\n\n\"Can I get that plate off the table for you yet?\" (Oh, no, we're still working on it, thanks.) .... \"Hey, want me to clear that plate for you, girls?\"\n\nNo, we haven't even taken another bite since that lady stopped by... what is happening?\n\nIf they looked even moderately similar, I'd have felt insane deja vu that would've suggested that I, too, was insane.\n\nAs far as food goes, we enjoyed the shaved kale with dates, pepitas, and cheese curds, coconut curry (for my vegetarian pal) and classic miso ramen with pork shoulder. The curry was spicy and delicious, heavy on the broth and the heat. The more classic-style ramen was definitely jonesing for a little kick, added with chili oil and sriracha. Our duo of servers were attentive, almost to a fault. Like... interrupting us to check in, desiring seemingly bite to bite updates. That being said, the bites were quite tasty. The pork shoulder was a little tough, but otherwise all quite good. We enjoyed our cans of beer and our food, which was swept away immediately the second we finished our food. Our male server came over to let us know that, despite receiving our check, \"No hurry though, take your time.\"\n\nFive minutes later, the moment after we placed our card down for the check, the female server came over and, despite our earlier server letting us know \"no hurry\" she  told us, in no uncertain terms, that \"because we have a waiting list, we need you to leave the table.\"\n\nEx-SQUEEZE ME? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!\n\nShocked by the sudden change in what we were supposed to do, we left, my friend just barely finishing the last of her drink.  I felt like this behavior totally ruined the experience for me, which was not going too poorly up to the point. But now, whenever I think of Cheu, I won't remember the ramen slipping through my chopsticks or the curdy kale. I will remember a rude, confusing waitress hustling me out the door as soon as we put down our tip. \n\nIf I had the ability to take the tip back and reduce it, I would.",

  "text": "Sofra is a Turkish café on Bristol Pike in Levittown, Pa.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, with small stature in a rather unattractive part of Bucks County, but grab some courage and go inside.  Within, you will find a small dining room, with open floor space for entertainment.  Most important, the chef knows a thing or two about Istanbul cuisine.  \n\nOur Saturday jaunt to a commercial area nearby resulted in us stopping in to check out what was going on here.  We were greeted by a gentlemen I took to be an owner, owing to his general lack of social grace. Why else would he be handling guests?  Still, we sat to one side and were brought menus and cold water.  I am no maven when it comes to Turkish kitchens, but Middle Eastern chow I know something about from time spent in the eastern Mediterranean.  \n\nI was looking for lamb gyro as an introduction to the skill here, but it was not available for lunch.  So, I looked further and found Shepherd's Salad, Falafel and Grilled Lamb in Pita Sandwich as attractive alternatives.  All arrived about ten minutes later in the hands of our erstwhile host.  The Salad was a plentiful pile of Tomato, Cucumber, Black Olive, Red Onion and a nice Olive Oil based herbed dressing.  Very refreshing. The Falafel Plate was 5 nice sized balls of ground chickpea and herbs, deep fried to a medium brown finish, with a stainless bowl of Tahini Sauce in the middle.  Wedge Tomato and Lettuce garnish.  Liked it!  Finally, the Grilled Lamb wrapped tightly in pita and again in paper, was excellent, with a rich BBQ-like flavor and more lettuce, onion and a wonderful savory taste.  Star of the show. \n\nWe weren't asked if we wanted dessert or Turkish coffee (we did), but were handed the check as soon as we finished eating our mains.  I guess we weren't on the guest list, even being the only customers in the house.  \n\nToo bad, because Sofra has potential.",

But this Sunday the skies were clear, I was buzzed, and my dad and I finally got to celebrate our birthdays by eating delicious pig! \n\nI had no idea what to expect but I have been excited about this place after seeing the smoker out back every time I come to get my hair done at Trim next door. When you go in, the atmosphere is more BBQ joint than fancy restaurant, but perhaps a touch more classy. There's a full bar back there behind the bar which is an anomaly at a BBQ place. I did like the Christmas pig decorations - light up pig in Santa suit and pig Christmas stockings. Hello, that's just cute. \n\nSo we had a seat in a booth and the waitress came over to take our orders. I got the pulled pork plate with the sweet corn and mac and cheese. Sadly the sweet potatoes were sold out so I will have to come back and try that. The pork was smoky and had a good flavor. I liked the traditional sauce on it. I didn't like the watery Carolina sauce or the mustard based sauce. The Memphis sweet sauce was ok but I really wish there had been a more fiery option! The corn was delicious and the mac and cheese was good. The parents didn't like the green bean casserole so much but then, they are used to green beans being cooked with ham hocks until pretty much mushy. I tried my brother's rib and although it didn't fall off the bone, it was SO SMOKY and flavorful! I am not usually a rib girl but I could definitely devour a rack of those ribs. The little dinner rolls they served were soft and a perfect complement to the pork. Sadly we were all too stuffed from dinner to even think about dessert but I saw some Red Velvet Cake and some bread pudding options that sounded pretty fab! Service was quick and friendly despite the fact that the waitress was the only one there. \n\nI liked this BBQ but I am not sure it is to-die-for-best-BBQ-ever. But a solid 4 stars and a place in my mental Rolodex as a BBQ place that is open on Sunday!!",

I probably had too high of expectations... but the food was just okay.\n\nI ordered the beef bourguignon because it's classic french and its hard to mess up.  It was a good portion, but lacked flavor.  I had a lot of fat on my beef which was a turn off. I think it would help if they seasoned the plain boiled potatoes that they served with the beef. I wasn't wowed by this dish but it wasn't bad, just average.\n\nThe red Rhone wine was great though! Our waitress was great, service was wonderful. My friend ordered the sea bass and they deboned it for her tableside.\n\nWe all shared a creme brulee for desert and it was good, I like that they didn't put a super thick layer of sugar on the top.\n\nThe ambiance is a bit odd, while the inside was decorated very nicely, on the outside, you have a very \"nice\" view of the gas station. lol. It's just strange because you feel like you are in a really nice place, but looking at the gas station while you are having dinner is a bit odd. Maybe, that's just me.\n\nI would give this place another try, but I will definitely order something else.",

After snagging a doughnut for ourselves and a few for some friends back in BHAM we were on our way. We, of course,​ purchased their ever famous 100 layers doughnuts or \"cronuts\" as they call them. A little on the pricey side but it's a 100 layers​ of croissant dough so I get it. I had a taste of a Vanilla Cream doughnut and really enjoyed my nice midday snack on my drive home.\n\nAll in all, a pretty solid choice.

Talk about romantic . . . my honey's yeyes started melting the ymoment we walked in, and things just kept yimproving from there.\n\nStarted the meal off with about the best foie gras I've ever tasted. As good as Keller's at TFL. Moved on to a classic Steak Diane served with green beans (tickled with pancetta) so fresh and flavorful they exploded in your mouth. Dessert was a trio of excellent choices, but the one that stood out was the Meyer Lemon Tart made from lemons grown on the property.\n\nPerhaps it was that we kept buying over-priced glasses (at $20 a pop) of Nicolas Feuillatte  Brut Rosé Champagne, NV (along with a delicious glass of ice wine served with the foie gras), but they didn't charge us a corkage fee when we showed up with a 2005 Ampelos Pinot Noir (92 pts from WS). That was very nice of them: As was the server whose name I forget, but who's been there for 17 years and was a total sweetie, along with being a complete professional.\n\nAll-in-all, one of the finer meals we've had the pleasure to enjoy, with great service in a magically wonderful setting.

The magic of the texture...soft...smooth...full and cool, dissolving across your palate into liquid velvet. The taste almost seems to change and it makes it's way into...in through you. Yeah. It's ice cream. This review isn't about sorbet, gelato, sherbet, or frozen yogurt. This review is about 2 scoops of the original treat, served from a sweet smelling shop in Mid-City. \n\nI probably eat ice cream 4 times a year, and rarely do I leave home with the sole intent of buying ice cream to eat right there. But I saw that there was a Baskin Robbins right in the heart of the Mid-city shopping complex and I couldn't resist. Parking was super easy. \n\nThe shop:  I should call it a 'shoppe'. It's cute, small, well lit, and CLEAN! And you know exactly what sugar cones and waffle cones and happiness smell like when you walk in. The guy behind the counter was fast and courteous and let me try a few samples (I know, I know...we all owe it to ourselves to try new flavors) but I ended up with a double dip...chocolate and cookies'n'cream. Both had perfect mouthfeel. I ordered it in a waffle cone, and it was okay BUT seemed to have way to much cinnamon. I'm hoping it was just a mistake in the measurements for that batch. \n\nAnyway, it felt good. I felt like a kid again. I will definitely visit again and recommend anyone in the area do so.",

  "text": "Honestly. I'm a bit disappointed here and not with the food...\nMy husband and I used to use our GSR Platinum card to get the buy one get one free coupon to the Elements Buffet every single week. \nThen the buffet closed and re-opened downstairs...which we all know wasn't the best.\n\nNow it's reopened again!! And after the renovations as The Grand Buffet I couldn't wait to try it!!!! \nI'll start with the positives...\nI do love the look and the new lay out is very nice compared to what it used to be. The waitress, or the one we got, was on top of everything. She apologized saying \"they were alone\" so I am guessing either they didn't have enough people working after the opening or people called out sick? Either way I didn't notice because of how well she did. \nI enjoyed the many new stations. Mediterranean station is my favorite...there was a chicken shawarma with Tzatziki in little cast iron things.. Those and the brisket Mac N cheese in the same holder... Amazing. Reallllly good. Also, kettle cooked chips in the soup area is genius. The new ravioli sauté station... WOW. So..Soooo...good. We discovered you can bring items from the salad bar to be put in our pastas...peas and bacon anyone? This is all better than it used to be at least.\n\nNow to the cons though...\nWhile I really enjoyed all the new mini casseroles... The cast iron they had it in was actually pretty heavy to carry with one hand. My left hand had a massive surgery and has pins in it now which makes it very weak. Anyone with wrist/hand problems in their left (or plate carrying hand) will find trouble here... And they're hot too... So heavy and hot cast iron means I'm carrying ONE at a time... And at a buffet, I want to be able to carry more...\nThe coupons. As I said before, we used the 'buy one get one' buffet coupons very regularly. It was a good place for the family to go and get to eat whatever they wanted (not arguing over what to eat that night) the buffet has it all! \nWell, now it's too expensive without our 'buy one get one'...and the hostesses at the buffet said they're trying to get rid of all locals coupons completely for the buffet!? There is only a 5$ off now which at 20.99$ a person on the weekdays still puts us out 45$. What used to cost 25$.\n\nIt's because of this that we decided we will try to find a new 'locals' buffet offering better deals. Maybe the Atlantis or Nugget offers deals to locals still that are better than this and when they're the same price, well.\nAtlantis is better and kinda always has been so if they offer good locals deals too... We will just switch to a whole new Hotel/Casino to frequent...we are looking into players cards and the deals that come with them around town because if I'm truly being honest here...one of the reasons we came to GSR so often was the buffet.\n\nAll in all...it was four stars for me before... And because they're getting rid of the players card locals deals to the buffet, we may actually not come back.",

  "text": "The decor left me confused. There's what appears to be a... boat dock in the middle of the restaurant. One wall has some flowers and leaves or something, another wall has what I think were sugar canes, or bamboos or... something. And then there was a little vineyard sort of doohickie in the corner through which the employees on break were totally spying on us. Confusing (albeit totally interesting) decor aside, the food was pretty good. The restaurant recommendation came from fellow Yelpers when I mentioned that I was looking for a Thai restaurant near Center City. I don't know how a Malaysian restaurant counts as Thai, but I wasn't going to complain because I was looking for an excuse to try Banana Leaf anyway.\n\nThe food:\n- Banana Leaf Satay Chicken: chicken was uber-bland, but the peanut sauce was pretty good. \n- Indian Mee Goreng: Indian style stir-fried noodles with various ingredients thrown in. I'm assuming the \"Indian\" part of the dish was the curry flavor; where it lacked in creativity, it made up in deliciousness. \n- Sizzling Beef with Black Pepper: meh. The title says it all. Not sure why I expected it to be anything other than beef that was sizzling... with pepper on it.\n- Shrimp fried rice: standard fare that was done well.\n- Malaysian Iced Tea: \"Does it taste sort of like Thai iced tea?\" \"Oh yeah, like Thai iced tea.\" Lies. But still pretty good. \n- Fried ice cream: is a misnomer; it was fried batter with the most miniscule amount of ice cream. And the awkwardly placed fried banana pieces with the giant battered balls just made me kind of uncomfortable because I was sitting next to my girlfriend across from her parents.\n- There was something else but I can't remember it now. \n\nI'm a huge (HUGE) fan of Penang, and I think if I had gotten what I normally get there at Banana Leaf, I would have been equally impressed. But for now, I liked it but didn't love it. Will definitely be back to try some of my favorite dishes though; really hoping to bump the rating up to a four or five because from what I've heard, Banana Leaf doesn't have stupid limits on how much you have to spend to use your credit card like Penang.",

Not only did it take almost 20 minutes to place our order, but the meal took an additional 45-50 minutes to come out after that. Really a lengthy wait for simple food. My mom's grilled grouper sandwich was fresh and delicious and a nice portion size, but my bf's fried grouper sandwich was little more than half the size compared to previous visits and woefully under-seasoned. \n\nThe fries served with my chicken tenders were tasty but over-cooked, many were fried a little too hard and I received the tail end of a batch with quite a few burnt small pieces.  \n\nSince the new ownership has taken over, we have noticed several negative changes, would strongly recommend checking the seasoning and improving the fried grouper sandwich to more closely match the phenomenal one served here in the past. \n\n\nOne nice touch: 10% discount when you put your cellphones in a basket on the table and not touch them for the duration of the meal and the service was friendly.",

  "text": "My theory on certain Chinese food items is they spread in droves across America, with the following key characteristics:  simple, cheap, and authentic.  This happened with scallion pancakes a few years ago and soup dumplings a little more recently, but maybe hand pulled noodles is the new craze in various parts of the country.  Nanzhou is probably Philly's most famous rep for la mian (handpulled noodles), and it has many local accolades to prove it.\n\nNanzhou does the city of brother love well, giving a chance for tourists (the main clientele here) a chance to sample some cheap Chinese eats.  The place is divey for Philly standards and true to it's Chinatown form:  it's cramped and difficult for group dining, a bit dodgy at night, and not exactly the cleanest place on the block.  Yet it's still among the \"places to go\" in most Philly tour guide books and luckily for many non-Chinese literate patrons, the menu is in English.\n\nFor roughly $6 a bowl, one can have various versions of handpulled noodles (or \"handshaved\" noodles in the menu) in a simple yet tasty vegetable, meat, or seafood broth.  The noodles themselves aren't too starchy, semi-thin like spaghetti, and perfectly smooth for the inevitable \"noodle slurp.\"  In terms of toppings / meats, the beef can be a tad tough, but the seafood and fish balls are dynamite almost every time.  I always recommend a tea egg with the soup, and take advantage of the vinegar, hot chili condiments at the table for that extra kick.  If the regular menu of meats are a bore, definitely go for the atypical choices like tripe, pig ears, or oxtail for a savory alternative.\n\nService isn't going to be the nicest but they'll always be efficient.  They fill glasses of water / tea up quickly and are quick to clean the table for people waiting in line during their rushed dinner service.  I do wish they opened later than 9PM each night and if they're going to service tourists, I'm surprised they've stuck to cash only.  Perhaps this is the only way to prevent the prices from spiking.  Here's hoping they stay afloat by continuing to offer their noodle soups on the cheap.",

Kevin was our Sushi Chef, all the Chef behind the bar were very entertaining.\n\nWe ordered Sake as we reviewed the menu. One thing I noticed is how extensive, maybe overwhelming the menu options were. We are pretty straight forward pure Sushi/Sashimi lovers. We ordered: Sweet Shrimp, Smelt Egg w/Quail Egg Sushi, Edamame (garlic soy flavor), Spicy Thruster (3 spicy handrolls of tuna, yellowtail, scallop), Jalapeno Yellowtail (red jalapeno. habanero sauce), Su-Miso Albacore (mustard su-miso, jalapeno, cilantro).\n\nThe sushi was OK, though they did not have Uni to our disappointment. The Spicy Thrusters, very OK. The Special Yellowtail and Albacore dishes were OK. Fish quality did not have a lot of taste, though presentation of everything and service was very good. \n\nWith competition being so high in Santa Barbara, we will try a different place next visit.",

As a true lush, I ordered a double vodka & cranberry from Ulele while waiting on my gyro, and only had time for a photo of my giant gyro before we had to get in line at the gate. Nonetheless, I nibbled on my breakfast during the flight, and the next day from hotel suite's fridge, and thoroughly enjoyed the deliciousness of this gyro. Look at all that lamb! Look at all that egg! Unfortunately, I don't see this on their menu for non-airport locations, so I guess I'm going to have to fly Southwest (or maybe Frontier?) from Terminal C to enjoy this huge, yummy breakfast gyro again.",

The birthday boy suggested we hit up IV Loop because that was the thing back when he was at UCSB (oh yeah...we were a group of about 12 26-27 year olds, but we're all Asian so we looked like all the other barely 21 college students in the area LOL). We bought 3 pitchers and the owner asked if we wanted chilled glasses or plastic cups (it's like he knew we were planning on playing flip cup). We asked for plastic cups so we can play flip cup on the tables outside. The owner was so nice about it! He even came out with a pint of beer for the birthday boy on the house, made him down it, then stayed for a minute to cheer us on while we played flip cup! \n\nGreat beer selection, various size choices, and super cool owner!",

  "text": "I know ramen and noodle places have been all the rage lately so I wanted to check out Cheu Noodle Bar.  I was curious about the different interpretation by others.  I was excited by all the good comments about the pork belly.  \n\nThe place itself is pretty small and cozy.  I love the lamps over the bar!  My party of three were seated at the bar (and YES, there are coat hooks under the bar).\n\nI ordered a pork belly bun to start off with.  It is really tiny, like the size of a two bite brownie.  I wasn't really expecting such a fried and greasy \"bun\" or like some flat fried  dough.  There was a sauce inside along with cilantro and pickles with the pork belly.  Honestly, I couldn't taste the pork belly with all of that greasiness.  It was pretty disappointing.  \n\nWe also order the black wings.  While it was nicely crisp, the sauce was super potent while the actual chicken had no flavor.  We also ordered the brisket ramen and the pork ramen.  I didn't like the super super soft poached egg, borderline gross.  The broth had a nice kick but the noodles were chewy.  Brisket was tender but matzo ball was weird and unappetizing..like a wet sock.  Nothing special about the pork ramen broth.\n\nWhile the servers were really nice and the place is still a BYOB (for now), the food wasn't my cup of tea.  It was pretty pricey for an unsatisfying meal.  Definitely not a place I'd go to for a ramen craving.",

At $10.99 a pound, over double what most places charge for crawfish in New Orleans, that's a no.  We said we'd try the first couple and if we wanted more, we'd obviously order them.  She huffed and put the order in.\n\nOur crawfish were served room temperature and tasted nothing like the potatoes.  When we asked about them, we were told that, \"every crawfish boil is different, so you never know what you're going to get.\"  WHAT WE GOT SUCKED.  The potatoes had better flavoring.  These tasted bland and lame... we stuck with those 2 lbs... reluctantly paid and left. \n\nDeanie's is supposed to be one of the standard bearers in New Orleans... this was a complete failure... from the food to the attitude of the server.  \n\nTerrible.",

We were welcomed and seated by a very friendly host right away. We had a reservation, which I definitely recommend as the place is small and very popular.

I went with a Bellini martini to start and it really hit the spot. \n\nWe chose a bruschetta appetizer, my hubs ordered the veal porcini and I requested the penne alla vodka. The bruschetta was just plain \"wow\".  Warm, lightly toasted ciabatta loaded with super fresh, sweet, cherry tomatoes, and the portion size was very generous. My husband's veal was so tender. It was a huge hit.  My pasta was delicious! There was a good amount of lump crabmeat and the sauce was surprisingly lighter than I had expected, but without a sacrifice in taste. \n\nTo close things out we shared their tiramisu, and I had a cappuccino.

So flavorful and hearty, it was accompanied with a sweetened mustard, green scallions, and grilled white pancake bread similar to the kind they would give you at a Chinese restaurant with your Peking duck. My salmon with lemon asparagus risotto was a heavenly dish. The thick slab of salmon was light and flaky, cooked just enough to preserve a medium rare like texture inside. The outer skin was a wonderful contrast of crispy to the tender, succulent inside. The risotto was a perfect complement. A fine French-style dish. If I could find a way to come and eat here by myself without looking like a crazy, single old bat, I would. I would come here quite often.\n\nSadly, my date this time didn't have the same hearty appetite as my date the first time. I got the feeling he wasn't very adventurous with his food as he ordered the \"green circle\" chicken, which was actually quite remarkable as far as chicken dishes go. The chicken was cooked perfectly. I will definitely be eyeing this place again as a dining destination now that one of my other favorite French restaurants has bumped up their prices to astronomical proportions.",

  "text": "It's very strange to me that I had never been to 717 South because I've pretty much been to all of the other restaurants on South Howard already. In fact, I used to run by this place all the time and thought, \"Oh, there's 717 South,\" and pretty much didn't think anything else. \n\nSo when I decided to come here, I was stepping a little bit outside my normal realm of restaurants. It seemed like a nice place, so I figured I would give it a shot. \n\nWe came in and had reservations so we were seated immediately. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty trendy but does not cater to the younger Soho crowd which congregates a little bit further up the street. \n\nWe started with the baked brie, which was VERY good. It was topped with a cranberry mixture which provided a wonderful tart and sweet taste with the richness of the brie. Really a great appetizer.\n\nAfterwards, we were brought this pesto bread which came with a tomato and cheese mixture. This was REALLY good and was an excellent bread choice. I don't even like bread but that tomato and cheese sauce mixture was awesome and very unique. \n\nFor dinner I opted for the macadamia nut chicken with broccoli and the chef's vegetable, which was asparagus. The broccoli was average. The asparagus was pretty good. The chicken itself was tasty, but it felt super fried and greasy. The cream sauce that came with the chicken was very delicious though, and provided a good diversity to the chicken. \n\nMy boyfriend got the stuffed chicken which he said was very good BUT then he found out midway through that the middle of the chicken was undercooked. I felt bad because it was basically raw. That is sort of scary to me and caused him quite a bit of worry that he would get sick. Never good! \n\nWe told our waiter and he sent it back and brought out a new, fully cooked stuffed chicken. It was taken off of our check which was very much appreciated. \n\nThe service was pretty good and it was quick. The servers were very accommodating and understanding when we had to send food back, and taking the undercooked meal off of the check was very nice of them. I like when restaurants acknowledge their customers and go out of their way to make up mistakes for them. \n\nOverall I would give this a high three-star rating, but for Yelp's sake, I'm going to round up.",

It looked as if they gave a good amount of shrimp.  The other gal, got the seafood boil with just crab legs, and sausage, potatoes, and corn. There was no sauce provided, when she inquired what they had... it was only butter (I'm going to assume melted).  Honestly, it didnt look very appetizing, just plain and boring.  \n\nNot sure if getting something else would have made the experience better, but for this visit.... it was a flop.",

Our waiter Morgan was fantastic and somehow managed to get our huge group's drinks and food consistently throughout the entire day. The food was elevated bar fare, but very tasty and difficult to decide on what I wanted to sample! I tried the munchies and whatever is in their homemade cheese whiz is pure heaven! I also had the pork rinds and smoked wings. I don't even like pork rinds that much, but I couldn't stop eating them. They were fresh and incredible! They have a nice cocktail menu, but a few of the drinks were a bit sweet for me, so I stuck to greyhounds most of the evening. \nI can't recommend Clyde's highly enough.

We walked into this amazing coincidence unknowingly and just had to try both of them, to our mock dismay.\n\nThe flavors available are varied and imaginative (twinkies, for example). They have a nicely appointed board on the wall with a visually pleasing examples of flavors that are, flavors that were and flavors to be. Just about everything is represented. Except a staple for my froyo cravings. That staple being a hot fudge pump. Didn't see one, but I didn't ask. Maybe I just missed it.\n\nThe service is just how I like it these days: Stiflingly great. Well, they don't quite smother you with kindness, but close. I mean this in the nicest way. Keep it up. I was pleased to the gills at the true pride every employee I encountered took in this place.",

That's just what happened to me on the very busy Friday of Valentine's day as I was rushing into this Save Mart to pick up some last minute gifts for my kiddos.  I was speed walking from my car to the entrance when an employee was gathering carts and politely and quite charismatically asked me if I needed a cart.  I was in such a hurry, I didn't even stop to take notice of who was speaking to me, though I did cordially respond with a gentle \"no thank you\", to which he added, \"my pleasure, you have a nice day.\"  He seemed so genuine and sincere, that it stuck with me the rest of the day.\n\nIn all my years of shopping at various grocery stores, I have never encountered that kind of hospitality, particularly in a parking lot.  And yet, that is the kind of customer service I would like to experience.  Most times, I'm even happy when the cart collector or other clerks make eye contact with me and smiles or nods in passing. \n\nWhile this moment doesn't make me want to drive out of my way to shop here, it was enough that I felt I had to share my story.  And if you do shop here, I'm sorry I don't know exactly who he was, but I hope he's there making your day, too.",

They didn't turn off the lights during the entire movie (I'm talking about those wall sconces)!  There was no bouncer at all!  There was one kid that kept talking throughout the entire movie!  Hearing \"Is he dreaming?\" from a little kid whose grandfather wouldn't tell the kid to shut up about killed the movie for me.  Oh yeah, one final gripe is the lack of maintenance.  The bf & I moved to a different aisle after we couldn't stomach the constant talking by the aforementioned kid.  I couldn't put my drink in the cup holder since the cup holder was really loose (as in it could fall off & is hanging by a screw).  The only good thing is the cheap prices ($4 for an evening show) as mentioned in the previous reviews.  It's a tiny movie theatre.  I might come back here but only at later in night shows (9 PM) so that I can avoid the \"Is he dreaming?\" nonsense.",

Mostly b/c the lack of salt in said oysters didn't have the right combination of vodka, oyster and cocktail sauce.  Overall though it was a good first stop for our Oyster Crawl",

I enjoyed my Czech Pilsner.  Solid vodka selection.  Good burger (albeit, a bit overcooked) & fries, but not the best in town.  Good beet salad. The server did a great job, too.  \n\nThe cons:  Atmosphere, or lack thereof.  Dark & uncomfortable.  Horrendous rap/hip hop music playing.  (I don't remember all the lyrics, but \"f#ck this sh*t\", was the main chorus).  Beef stroganoff wasn't good.  Tough beef in a reddish gravy served next to some egg noodles, with a roll.  \n\nI'd maybe go back for vodka shots, but not likely.",

Wait was about an hour.\n\nWe get there and it is a small cozy place filled with great smells. We decided to go for it all. We order three egg rolls, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, dan dan noodles (WARNING: these are super spicy), stir fry broccoli, dry rub chicken, and the special pork belly cooked twice. \nI will say the pork belly was my least fave because of how much fat was on each piece.

Seriously the best damn french fries I've had ever.\n\nWe happened into what we thought was going to be a traditional bistro, but turned out to be anything but.\n\nThis hole in the wall amazing place is located inside and at the rear of the 700 club bar.  Initially when I saw 700 club on the outside of the darkened building, it reminded me of the religious group that used to be on TV Sunday mornings when I was a kid. A channel quickly flipped by\n\nThis little hidden gem has three high top tables, a few chairs, and seriously the best fries that you will find anywhere in the French quarter. Grab a menu from the wall, and head over to the window to place your order. Once your order is placed and paid for they will give you her number and bring the food to your table.\n\nWe ordered a plain cheeseburger... Meat, cheese, and the barn. Let me just say for a very plain cheeseburger it was delicious! Have I mentioned how good those damn fries were?! Seriously, I even asked the kitchen what they put on them or how they make them. All I know is that I was told numerous spices, and that was about all they were going to share.  \n\nWe also ordered what was called a cheesy burger. The concept in theory sounded divine.  Big chunks of meat slathered in cheesy sauce, horseradish sauce, and topped with shoestring fried onions. Who would not want that goodness?!\n\nThe pictures say 1000 words, and yes, the sandwich was absolutely huge. Did I mention that the price points were pretty reasonable for local food? A couple of sandwiches and order of fries, and a drink for under $30. That's considered reasonable in the area.  The sandwich was almost impossible to eat because as you can see in the pictures the cheesy sauce was everywhere LOL unfortunately, the meat was heavily salted to the point that it was practically inedible. In a regular restaurant I would've sent the food back.  This whole in the wall is pretty much a make to order place, which is part of it's charm.  I was able to pick around it but it something that I definitely would not order again, and less I had assurances that the meat wasn't going to be overly salted\n\nMusic from the bar spills into the area and definitely warms the atmosphere.  Here is where good food and cool vibes come together. With the tunes blasting, and the people drinking, they are sure to be random dancing and fun to be had.\n\nGreat place for a quality burger, and if you are in the area and don't try the french fries, you seriously are missing out on good eats. The guy that was sitting behind us was there just for the fries.  I now know why!! Seriously, this is one of the best hidden gems in the quarter",

Not sure why because it it's not really any of those things. This place is in Centro Ybor below the movie theater. I had a seasonal port that was Gingerbread. It was quite different and a bit bitter so I wasn't able to finish it. I was really excited to try the beer cheese soup. While it was quite tasty, it was thicker than I expected and a tad too salty. I dipped my friends pretzel in it and wondered if this was the same cheese they served on the side of her pretzel. I ordered the crab/shrimp cakes from the appetizer side and it was ok. I felt it could have been cooked longer. My hubby had the shepards pie and it was also just ok. I tasted a cider wing that was profiled on DDD and it was really good. Too much heat for me personally but a great flavor. We sat outside which we really enjoyed since the cold air was filtering in.",

This past time I did the create your own, and I must say, I really enjoyed the whole experience from ordering to the dish itself! I love the Wawa-style touchscreen ordering system for customizing the order, and the dish came out fast!\n\nMy order this time was tofu (double order), rice noodles, broccoli, carrots, kale, green beans, bell pepper, chili flakes, shallots and a regular order of sesame garlic sauce. Totally delicious and served hot, and I like how they had sriracha available in the condiments section.\n\nThis pint of stir fry came to $11.99, which is a few dollars more than I expected from a fast-casual place, but I understand the premium is due to the local/organic/farm-to-table factor (not important to me - I'd be happy with non-local/conventional ingredients for $8.99 - but I realize this is their branding/selling point.) Very satisfying food but I can see it being more of an occasional treat than being a regular, due to pricing.\n\nThey use the \"Fresh Tofu\" brand from Allentown - I've been a huge fan for a long time, probably around 20 years. I wish they would go a little easier on their frying method because sadly I found the tofu to be very chewy and almost inedible. Sautéed would be much better than deep frying. I also don't know what their single order of tofu looks like but my order didn't seem like it had a substantial amount. Will have to try a single order next time to compare.\n\nLooking forward to my next visit!",

  "text": "The Morris Burner Hotel is a little slice of what Burning Man is and has to offer.  It's a place to go and mix/mingle with like minded people.  They have drum circles on Monday nights, Tuesday Talks, with educational and informative topics.  They have pot lucks, DJ's, bands, art cars, art pieces.  I've never stayed the night here, but I have looked at quite a few of the rooms.  They're all decorated differently, and give off an amazing vibe.\nThe bar has recently been updated with a sort of Steam Punk feel to it.  It's absolutely beautiful.   If you ever want to get an idea of what Burning Man is like, or what/who Burners are, pop on down to the Morris.  You'll be welcomed with open arms by everyone that's there.  You'll probably get a warming hug as you walk in.  )'(",

  "text": "Monsu has been on my \"must try\" list for over a year, and I finally made it in with my husband and another couple on a snowy Friday evening.  While I wasn't as blown away by the food as I expected from other reviews, the ease of getting a reservation and extremely good service solidified a fourth star - and also guaranteed a return visit.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is nice - more cozy/homey than fancy.  The tables are less cramped than many similar BYOB spots.  There were many more tables open than I would have expected for a Friday evening, but the weather reports of an impending major snow (that never materialized) may have been responsible.  The noise level was lively, but not overpowering even though there was music playing and a large group dining.  The hostess was pleasant, and our waitress was a knowledgeable, super-effective sweetheart.\n\nOur entire party took advantage of the 4-course \"Turista\" menu (though, this was not obligatory), which was a great way to sample many different offerings at a reasonable price.  Everything that came to the table was, at a minimum, good food; unfortunately, many of the dishes were very rich and/or salty without those characteristics being balanced out.  The escargots and duck-gorgonzola ravioli suffered the most from this; though both were quite tasty and I would consider ordering either again, but to share with a friend and enjoy with a salad.  The mussels, snapper and a deceptively humble-sounding roasted chicken were the stars of the table.  I was also hoping for a little more wow from the desserts.  The two cannolis that came to the table were fine, a chocolate cake was a little dry, and the fourth dessert escapes memory.\n\nThe manager (I think?) was making rounds later in the evening pouring complimentary shots of an after-dinner aperitif, which helped fortify us all for the walk home.  I'm not sure if this is standard practice, but it definitely made sure we walked out of there feeling well taken care of in addition to being well fed.  It was the little things like this that changed my take-home message from \"Yeah - that was good\" to \"We should go back to that place!\"",

I was driving from New Jersey to Virginia and saw that I could easily stop in Philly. I googled \"best cheese steak in Philadelphia\". Sonny's was high on the list. I easily found parking on Market Street and made it to the shop before the lunch crowd. The woman behind the counter helped me place my order (glad she was patient since I had never ordered this before). I got the cheesesteak with Velveeta, sautéed onions, french fries, and a drink. The sautéed onions took the flavor to a whole other level. Every bite was bliss. I am glad I came to Sonny's when I did because as I was leaving the lunch crowd was lining up all the way to the door. I can understand why. Highly recommend.",

There were quite a few people waiting at 10AM for a table to open up. \n\nThe service was very friendly. \n\nI had a cheese omelet which was basic but good. Their hash browns are large chunks of potatoes with onions. If you don't like onions, don't worry because they don't overload them. Most of my family enjoyed their food, my mom really liked her mediterranean omelet. The only issue with the food was that my step father was served practically a burnt waffle, very visually obvious, and he won't send things back so he basically dealt with it, but it should never have been served in the first place like that. Dark brown=burnt. \n\nThe pricing is very fair! I would definitely come back for breakfast!",

  "text": "Wish pollo chicken was closer to my home. The service at this location is great.  Seriously.. I forget it's fast food. Today, I came in for a quick lunch and ordered some tostones and roasted chicken. When I asked what sauce goes with them.  The sweet lady pointed towards the sauce counter and said, \" pick which ever you like.\" Although most may not get excited for things like this.  The fat cherub in my mind was smiling.  All of their sauces are great and having to choose just one would put unneeded stress to my day. \n\n Choices make me happy since I'm a serious dipper.  I love variety and they had 5 different sauces to dip my chicken and tostones. \n\nOverall, I love this fast food concept. It's quick, clean and delicious. \n\nTo all the people that have to see me eating chicken. I apologize in advance. I am that girl that leaves nothing on a bone.",

Also split a bowl of chili, Their chili is very good, not spicey , almost sweet. a nice change of pace.\n\nHubby got the open face roast beef sandwich with double mashed and it was good.

However the burger was too greasy and caused the pretzel bun to delapidate itself before I was halfway done eating it. The fries, by contrast were cold and hard. I asked the waitress if they were reheated, and she said definitely not but offered to remake them for me.  I didn't think they would appeal to me either way, so I dropped it. \n\nThe salad bar was somewhat redeeming. Although it was the end of the day and the spinach appear to be wilting, the majority of the salad bar was well stocked enough, and fresh, and the serving area was sufficiently clean.",

Can't go wrong with them. \n\nAs for the service. .ugh. the service. Same lady working behind the bar that had apparently for 50 years and it shows.

We were greeted by who we thought was our server, but then someone else took our order. Server #1 explained the menu and offered suggestions, and Server #2 who eventually took our order explained the spice level as we were trying to figure out what to order. (More on that later). After reviewing the many options for lunch (we were brought a drink menu, lunch menu, AND a dinner menu since that had the appetizer section), friend and I decided to share the Dan Dan noodles, wontons in chili oil, and the pork dry pot dish with white rice. Since the dry pot had a spice level of 5 which was the highest, I was hesitant in ordering it, but Server #2 recommended the dish, and indicated that it wasn't too spicy. Isn't that confusing? So is the dry pot more of a 4, then? \n\nAnyways, I didn't even enjoy the dry pot dish. While it wasn't too spicy as Server #2 suggested, it was heavy on the salt. Despite that disappointment, I enjoyed the Dan Dan noodles (very flavorful!) and the wontons. Wontons had a very nice kick to them. I'm not sure why the menu doesn't label the wontons as a soup since all of the dumplings were drowning in chili oil. Another fail were the plates! They were way too small and narrow. It was like eating off a kids' plate!  And being a messy eater that I am, the table was just a hot mess. Literally and figuratively. Server #1 was kind enough to bring fresh, clean plates, but we were looking for bigger plates to easily maneuver the food from the shared dish onto our plates.\n\nService was friendly, but it was strange to have two servers. Besides the great Dan Dan noodles, the tea was a hit! \n\nI'd like to give this place a second chance because it does have potential, but not until they work out a few things first!",

You will definitely open your mouth in awe at the decor. Moving along to actual dinner- the food is really good and definitely has a healthy twist.\n\nWe started with the sweet potato beignets, shrimp & tasso pinchos, and the boudin balls. I cannot speak on behalf of the boudin balls, and half of the pinchos- but it does not matter because my favorite of the appetizers was the beignets. Absolutely delicious- wish I had the whole plate to myself. Would definitely recommend getting these if you make a stop at SoBou.\n\nFor the main course, we just shared the whole gulf fish. Probably one of the tastiest fish I have ever had in my life. It was a lot of work eating it because of the bones and what not- but worth. If you come with friends or family that love fish, I would highly recommend getting the fish because it was absolutely delicious and definitely one of my favorite items from New Orleans.\n\nService is slow- typical of the South. Our waitress tried her best to accommodate to our impatience but it is what it is.\n\nCome to SoBou if you needed a healthier, modern take on NOLA cuisine. I will admit- I probably would not make this my first stop if I had realized how similar it was to places like home. But it was still really delicious and deserves some attention.",

It is average casino food and the only reason I eat here is because it is free.\n\nI like the cocktail shrimp. You can't do much to ruin that.  I also like their Pho options though the broth is bland and has no taste.\n\nPlace is always packed with a long line waiting to get in.\n\nThe chocolate ice cream is really good - dark chocolate.\n\nBest bet for food - eat at the salad bar, eat the shrimp, try the Pho and take a gamble with the beef brisket - it's hit or miss.",

  "text": "We stopped here before going to a comedy show on a Saturday night. It was early so it was pretty quiet. Good for us because our server didn't have a lot of tables to wait on. \n\nService was good and the food came out pretty quickly. My husband and I each ordered wings and we shared some fries. I ordered the smallest order you can get (4 or 5) and I had the jerk sauce. It was really good. It didn't beat the best jerk wings ever (Longdoggers in Cocoa Beach) but they were the next best jerk wings I have had. That alone earned them a 4th star from me because I love good jerk.\n\nMy husband ordered the medium. His forehead was sweating so they had some heat to them and he enjoyed them.\n\nI also tried the cucumber cooler. It didn't taste like there was any liquor in it but it was refreshing. I was thinking about having a beer but planned to have a cocktail later at the comedy club and you know the saying, \"beer before liquor, never sicker\" which is why I went with the cocktail here.\n\nNot bad for a quick dinner.",

This is probably because I'm awkward and stuff, but hey -- I know an awesome hostel when I see one.\n\nThe space is amazing, for a place you can sit around and enjoy all day, for only $25 or so, it's unbeatable. You are sleeping in a work of art. Hopefully more than sleeping there... the people seem to be really cool as well, and this sort of place attracts interesting folk. \n\nI really think Justin F. needs to delete or rethink his review. Yeah, if you get a really bad feeling about a place after driving by once, don't go, but also don't give it one star because you saw \"some guy\" sitting outside.\n\nOn that note, you will probably be a little puzzled when you drive up. Gram's doesn't look like a hotel at all, and barely looks like a hostel. Keep calm and carry on... you'll have a great time.",

  "text": "FAIL.\n\nSo I heard this place was great-- a real treat. The cocktails are expensive, yes, but supposedly you are treated with the utmost class and importance. You have to have a table, you can't just stand at the bar, and on Friday night my group of five waited about twenty minutes for that table. Fine.\n\nThe waiter was polite and knowledgeable. I ordered a \"Stormy Monday,\" which was served tall with rum and absinthe. Fancy ice cubes. It took another twenty minutes for our bow-tied waiter to bring the drinks. Fine.\n\nBut then another two girls (friends of a friend I was with) finally joined us from the line outside. We had already received our check, but every single glass at the table was still half full. We had waited a total of forty minutes and paid $12 each for these drinks. We were sipping for about ten.\n\nThe manager, \"Anthony,\" came to our table and asked us if we were all going to order another round. The original party said no, but the two new girls nodded eagerly, as they had been waiting outside to get in for awhile. Anthony told us that he was anticipating that a party of six would sitting down in a few minutes, as we had already gotten the check. \n\nHe essentially told us he'd like us to leave unless we were ordering another round. But I still had $6 worth of a drink left! My friend told him that the two additions to the table would be ordering. He told her that she was slurring her words (she was not) and it was time for us to go. We were shocked.\n\nI'm not proud to admit it, but as we left disgruntled, my boyfriend called out \"Thanks a lot douchebag,\" to which Anthony, the MANAGER OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT, replied, \"You're a f*ckstick!\" in front of the entire bar.\n\nHalfway down the block I realized I had left my scarf stuck in the corner of the booth. Luckily the nice bouncer got it back for me.",

It's definitely a splurge - if you do the math, don't cringe because you're basically paying for the equivalent of a pint of ice cream for just one scoop.  But you are really just paying for convenience.\n\nOne funny story - my friend from Ireland was visiting and wanted some ice cream. We walked in and saw there were dozens of different flavors, which I thought would boggle his wee Irish brain.  So what flavor does he want?  FREAKING VANILLA.\n\nHe said it was the best vanilla ice cream he's ever had.\n\nSigh.",

Eventually, Joe the cashier took my order. I decided to go with a burger and a fountain drink.

My fountain drink was not too good either. Even though I just got a Powerade, it seemed to have an odd after taste. \n\nThe restaurant itself, was not too clean. The floors were greasy and the area around the soda-fountain was covered with spilled drinks and lids. \n\nI did like how they had some outdoor seating. \n\nAltogether, this is not one of Five Guys best locations.",

In Canada it never happens. Thai is Thai, Japanese is Japanese.)\nWe ordered:\n- Tom Kha soup with chicken (good, I strongly recommend if you like Coconut based soups),\n- Tom Yum soup with vegetables (very good. Loved the fact that it was full of veggies and tofu, not just few pieces swimming in a broth. This soup was very flavorful and little bit spicy),\n- Eel sushi (delicious. It's great when you can actually taste the eel not just rice - as in other restaurants. Would order again. And for $7 it's great deal),\n- Red Curry with chicken (here is my disappointment: it was bland, missing salt maybe? Not sure but in my opinion curry is the signature dish in Thai cuisine! It has to be good! My husband actually said: \"This is first time when I'm eating so bland curry!\" I added salt but it was still missing some spices.",

It would have been nice if this were made clear at the time of ordering, but it wasn't a huge problem because we live nearby. \n\nWhen we went to pick up our order, the restaurant was packed at lunchtime, with what appeared to be no social distancing. I really didn't feel safe walking in, and it would have been more convenient to have a delivery or curbside pickup option.\n\nWe'd ordered a variety of dishes, including tacos, enchiladas, a quesadilla, burrito, and a few other things.  As others have mentioned, their tortilla chips are absolutely shameful and seem to come from a bag.  The food was pretty forgettable, and they left out two of our entrees, while charging us for them.  I had to spend 15 minutes or so on the phone with Grubhub to get a refund on the items we didn't receive, which was extremely annoying.\n\nI won't be back.",

The beans were very good, a little smoky, and our toddler devoured most of the bowl!\n\nThe oysters: wow! They had cheese and a spiced butter sauce all over them, and were so tasty! The dish comes with several pieces of bread which were perfect for mopping up the extra sauce. \n\nThe crab platter came with fries and a choice of coleslaw, hush puppies, or potato salad. We chose the hush puppies, and they were probably the best I've had. The fries, on the other hand were not great, maybe just ok. The crab was very good, Battered and fried. It was honestly a little strange to just eat the whole thing.

  "text": "God, I really need to start writing reviews for some gyms, because I ate a six ounce meatball last night. I had one of the best meals of my life yesterday at Randolfi's, and certainly one of my favorite meals in St. Louis. After being born and raised in the STL, it's so nice to be able to still have these mind-blowing culinary experiences after all this time.\n\nWe had an 8:15 reservation (though it appeared we didn't need it - it wasn't crowded at all), but decided to sit at the bar so we could sit next to each other instead of across a table (all together now: awwwww!) The bartender was absolutely amazing and I should have caught his name, but he really made our night with his recommendations. I will say, too, that the bar is the perfect place to sit to see all of the cocktail action as well as what's going on in the kitchen.\n\nI started with an *amazing* cocktail crafted with Four Roses bourbon, Big O Ginger Liqueur, sibona camomilla, rhubarb tea liqueur, house-made BBQ bitters, and a multitude of other things I couldn't remember if I tried. It truly blew my mind and was one of the best drinks I've had in years. I later moved on to a red wine that was also five-star worthy and perfect alongside pasta.\n\nWe started with the Crudo Del Giorno, wish was yellowtail prepared in a beautiful sauce, and also the Formaggio, which, lucky for us again, was a triple-cream brie. From there, our minds were blown by the meatball. You guys. You have to go try it as soon as you can. It's a combination of pork and lamb, and sits on top of the most glorious house-made pasta you could imagine, with hints of garlic, chili, and chive. Because we just couldn't help ourselves, we also had the asparagus risotto, which somehow was as good as the meatball. It was so rich and perfectly made, and had hints of parmesan and lemon.\n\nWe finished with two americanos and the chocolate torte, and I'm not sure we'll ever be able to eat again. This meal was so beautiful, the place was stunning, and I'm pretty much in awe of the food scene in our city right now. Thanks for an amazing date night, Randolfi's!",

  "text": "Was here for a private wedding event at the restaurant. In fact it was a 10 course Chinese meal wedding which I find kickass great and crazy amounts of food. However there are times in which I'm a fat kid on a cupcake, and a 10 course Chinese menu is no time to be on weight watchers, counting calories or on a diet honey!  Seriously. Here is a rundown of the pig out: \n\n1) Pork and Jellyfish - very solid. Lol actually I though I was eating duck it was rich and tasty! \n\n2) Fried crab claw appetizers. Chewy, crab-eriffic and piping hot\n\n3)  Scallop and gai lan- I'm spoiled as I'm used to fresh scallops. These were definitely frozen. Overall okay but not amazing. \n\n4) Shark fin- crab maw soup- Not sure if it was real shark fin. People are in uproars over SFS these days but I grew up with this on my Chinese side. I respect people's opinions but it's tradition for me. I'm fine if they outlaw it just don't get all preachy on me. \n\n5) Lobster- Cantonese style- absolutely delicious. If bugs of the sea are your thing they do a great job! \n\n6) Sea cucumber, mushrooms and fish- another great delicacy. Google sea cucumbers if you have a strong stomach. Definitely not a cucumber but definitely delish! \n\n7) Crispy chicken- a tad dry for my liking but flavour was spot on. \n\n8) Fish, Chinese ham, mushroom w broccoli. - okay my stomach was read to explode but this was quite good also. \n\n9) Fried rice- like I needed carbs at the end of a huge meal but it was moderately good. \n\n10) Noodles- had a very small serving. Stomach too full.\n\nThe brought out the traditional red bean soup to close the night off but I'm clearly not a fan of this. Also were some sesame buns and other treats. \n\nService at the restaurant was excellent and the meal although had some flat spots was overall very good!",

  "text": "Hello again Chipotle. \n\nYes, yes, I'm back. I know, I said that last time was the end, that I can't afford to eat here anymore. But I just can't get over you. I think about you all the time - on SEPTA, at work, alone at night staring at the ceiling. Sure, I've had others - Qdoba is nice, reliable, and treats me well, but it's just so safe and boring. And Taco Bell is good for a cheap thrill every once in a while, but when I wake up in the morning I'm always filled with regret from the night before. Food truck burritos too, but they're always on the move and I want some commitment.\n\nI know, I've made mistakes...that I've hurt you. But you've hurt me - your deceiving calorie totals when you've told me again and again you are a healthy alternative to fast food. Your ingredients are sometimes not as locally grown as your advertising indicates. You sometimes break federal immigration laws. There's that whole Salmonella and E. Coli outbreaks at several at your sibling locations. And, worst of all, the bump in the cost of guacamole, which you know I'll pay for because only terrible people who kick puppies and talk during movies don't order guacamole. \n\nBut you've also got good qualities too - I can order online. There is plenty of seating available at this location. And, I'm not ashamed to admit it any longer...you make a tasty burrito. Sometimes you send me coupons or even, with a knowing wink and nod, you \"forget\" to charge me for the guacamole, which makes me feel special in a way a Qdoba or Taco Bell can't. \n\nSo I'm asking for you to take me back. We can start over. Perhaps at a different location, such the Havertown or Wayne locations. I can cut back on other things, like overly-expensive brunch or frozen yogurt. Sure, you're not as popular as you once were, no longer the millennial golden fast food place of choice, but I don't care about that. What I'm saying is...we can make this work. I know we can make this work. I just need you to give me another chance.\n\nAnd you know what would make me forget you're trying poison me with Salmonella and E. Coli? Free burrito coupons. Come on, for old times sake.\n\nBut seriously this location sucks.",

  "text": "I had very high expectations for this place. I was expecting some bomb ass oysters. I ordered a half dozen raw and a half dozen charbroiled oysters. Both had one similarity, they had me spitting out huge pieces of debris or chewing on grit. I honestly think you could pass on the raw and would recommend you go to Lüke for their oysters instead. Hello, for Happy Hour Lüke serves $0.75 raw oysters and they are way better. Charbroiled Oysters at ACME offered a better flavor profile. The delicious herb-butter sauce was heaven. Make sure you dribble some of the sauce on these lightly cheesy oysters before eating. I couldn't stop drenching bread into the buttery pool of all things wonderful and shoving it in my mouth. Ambrosia!\n\nIf you do come here and when, that's right I said when, I come back, I'd get their fried dishes. I also ordered one of their fried seafood platter, fish and shrimp. The tilapia was flakey and soft and perfectly lightly breaded and crispy. The same went for their fried shrimp but you need to ask them for lots of tartar sauce. They have the best tartar sauce! The fries were normal fries. I opted for their cole slaw side which was also yummy. Not overly tart.",

  "text": "Every single staff person here is friendly in this well stocked and well lit store, but the pharmacy staff are rock stars of customer service even when the drive through is super busy and the inside lines for prescriptions and flu shots are long.  It is unfortunate for me to have been in enough times in the last thirteen weeks to have enough experience to marvel at all of this and before I shared that observation here on Yelp I told both the pharmacist who 'shot me' with flu vax yesterday and always cheer filled and efficient Austin at the pharmacy service window how impressed I was for my observations of the last many weeks of regular visits.\n\nOld enough to remember how my gradeschool teacher announced President Kennedy had been killed and with onset of a progressive central nervous system disease as a college student in the second Nixon term, one might think age and that diagnosis would make me a person well versed in pharmacy service for umpteen meds.   But not so as thanks to good luck and also hard work to stay in good general health, I need not a single 'regular rotation' medication even at the age where it makes docs say \"Really! Not one?\" in surprise when looking at a new patient's med chart during office visit.  Well, up until the last 3+ months when there have been a couple of meds and refilled regularly to treat a stubborn issue.\n\nSo it goes in these last thirteen weeks I have been a regular customer in this Walgreens to observe how many people need all kinds of meds filled here and how well the pharmacy staff manages all.  (Even events like a customer having meltdown to learn their insurance will not cover much of the cost of the med their doctor prescribed, a problem the pharmacy staff did not create nor can they fix it for insurance policy but the angry customer sure expected them to do that.)   And the pharmacists are helpful answering questions or giving instructions about the meds one has been prescribed and I've observed how well they do that for all ages of people at all levels of understanding.  \n\nKudos all around.\n\nNotes:\nLUNCH BREAK:  The pharmacy is closed daily from 1:30 - 2:00 when staff takes a well earned lunch break.\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Ample accessible (aka ADA) parking in front of store, level in the door, lots of clear floor space in aisles.\n\nLOO:  Some stores have locked theirs during covid19, this one (ADA accessible) is open and sparkling clean. \n\nCOVID19 MANAGEMENT:  Masks worn by all staff, masks required by all customer over the age of two, 6' spacing distances marked on floor at pharmacy and check out.\n\nICE CREAM!:  I didn't know Walgreens had a few grocery items in their stores but so they do.  Including a freezer with ice cream.  When I was a kid in Portland and went to the doctor for vaccines my mom and I would stop for cherry ice cream sodas on the way home.  Going in for a flu shot here seemed like a pretty good reason to go home with a carton of Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia from the freezer case.",

Yeah, it's a chain, but it's still a step up from the McD's and Taco Bell across the street from Chipotle. \n\nBesides, I'll admit it, I did have quite the Chipotle love affair when I used to live in Indiana. It was a craving that had to be satisfied, since I hadn't eaten Chipotle in about 4 years. And yes, it was very satisfying. At least, the food was satisfying. Chicken burrito w/ fajita veggies, black beans, cheese, lettuce, and a little bit of each salsa. \n\nSo big... so filling. It's a good thing that I built up quite the appetite in the 45 minutes that I waited in line. Oh, right, the wait. That would be the reason for 3 stars.\n\nYes, I get that they just opened. However, when Panera Bread opened a couple of months ago, they were just as overwhelmed. In fact, I think the lines were longer. The difference is, even with Panera's more diverse menu, the line moved quickly. There are some major kinks that need to be worked on at Chipotle, from the chefs to the order takers, and probably worst of all, the wrappers. That seemed to be the major hold up. I'm no burrito-wrapping expert, but I think they need some additional training.",

Myself, Vinny P. and Jim H. met up here to grab a few to many libations, share some laughs, and stories, with some bangin ass food. Yes I said \"bangin ass\" , because  kiddies this is the kinda joint you want to enjoy your night at. Besides the horrific parking situation you'd encounter this corner tap room is nothing short of amazing. \n\nA constant good vibe with bartenders who are very knowledgeable in the craft scene. We had the pleasure of dealing with Bill and he was on point with everything in which he was pretty solid with his recommendations . From the great crafts on tap that is in constant rotation, and the bottled selections even down to the nice liquor selections Taproom on 19th is on point. You'll surely find something to accommodate your thirst.  \n\nTap Room has some pretty good appetizers and bar snacks menu that you can look over. This is what we rocked out: \nWings~ Korean Style ! Dude, I mean DUUUDE these wings had me licking my fingers to the point I was about to gnaw on them thinking I had another wing. A nice subtle kick to them with cashews and sesames sprinkled over top adding more flavor to it. Order it!\n\nFor my main course I went with their:\nBetter Burger Project~  Truly a  carnivores dream burger in which I added  bacon , well their \"Insanity Garlic Bacon\" to this work of art.  BRRUUHH, Uhh-Maze-ING! This is a  Lamb burger with fresh mozzarella from DiBruno Bros. Oh it gets better, they also went and concocted a cucumber and tomato salsa,  with a rosemary and mint aioli. This master piece was held together on an Italian potato roll that was made in Conshy. That is Conshohocken for those who don't know what \"Conshy\" means. I am telling you this thing, this beast I had cooked at a medium rare was juicy and flavorful. I along with my partner in crime were making moaning sounds with every bite. It escalated from a \"PG\" scene to an \"R\" rated moment while devouring this . Literally this is a must .. A MUST order if you're a burger fanatic like myself.\n\nGreat bar, great crew, plenty of TVs for the sporting fan, with an amazing menu. I'm sold,I know I'll be back even if the parking could be a bish.",

  "text": "We came to Root after a zillion people raved about the scallops in the cigar box.  I easily made a res via OpenTable and we were quickly seated once we got to the restaurant.\n\nWe had two people helping us - a guy and a girl.  The guy asked what the occasion was since our guys had on jackets (no ties) and we had on dresses.  I told him, \"Y'all are the occasion...\"  Does no one dress up for dinner anymore?  Anyway, that kind of started the meal off on an odd foot.  That, and our waitress not showing up for about 20 minutes after we were seated.  Luckily, we had drinks to keep us company, but it seemed odd to wait so long when the restaurant wasn't full.\n\nOur amuse bouche was a watermelon and cucumber soup (two things that make my throat itch).  I tasted it and it was fine; everyone else raved.  It was an unexpected delight.  \n\nWe ordered three of the sausages to start - the lamb, the mexican sausage, and the chorizo.  The chorizo and mexican sausage were delicious spicy and paired amazingly well with the pickled peaches.  I also liked the lamb sausage - it was much milder in comparison and delicious.\n\nI had ordered the menage foie, but it got lost in translation and never came - which ended up being a good thing because I really got full off the appetizers.\n\nFor mains, I settled on the aloo gobi appetizer and they graciously prepared me some naan to go with it.  Hubs got the scallops, which were delightful (but weren't the best I've ever ever had...).  Another friend got the chicken and biscuits, which was an odd choice after we ate at Willie Mae's Scotch House that morning - it just didn't measure up, even though it was really good with that sauce.\n\nCoffee was delicious, as was my lime ice cream that they brought me out.  Yummy.\n\nOverall, I really liked Root and would recommend it - but I would recommend a few other places in NOLA first.  I think the tricky thing is that it didn't have that NOLA vibe to me - I felt like it could have easily been transplanted into Atlanta, and since I was in NOLA, I wanted the NOLA vibe... so if you're wanting to escape that, Root is a great option!",

Everything tasted from a can. Not much flavor. Today I decided to try them again. \n\nI used the drive thru, it took no time at to order. I ordered the chicken quesadilla combo, & did waffle fries as my side. It came with a drink too, & was $5.79 before tax. I pulled up to the window & paid. It took about 45 seconds to get my food. It takes longer at Taco Bell. It was at 2:15pm so I was worried the food had been sitting under a heat lamp. \n\nI took the food back to work and tried it. I love a waffle fry. These look like they'd be somewhat Cajun & peppery. They are not. My fries tasted like they'd been sitting a little in a heat lamp. They were warm, but kind of dried out & very chewy. I put some ketchup & salt on them & it made them okay. \n\nOnto the chicken quesadilla. I don't know what it is about quesadillas, but I LOVE EM. Tortilla, cheese, sauce, & chicken, how can you not love it?! There chicken quesadilla wasn't as good as I've had before. The tortilla wrap used is kind of thick, this one I think too had been sitting out & it was hard on the edges. Inside, chicken, cheese, some kind of sauce & tomatoes. It was okay, but it needed more flavor. More flavor from the chicken, more flavor from the sauce, more flavor from the cheese. It was just bland. The whole meal was bland. I wouldn't mind waiting 5 minutes for the food to be prepared to order, as opposed to eating something that had been sitting around for a while.",

  "text": "It blows my mind that Seoul Garden has 4 stars on Yelp.\n\nSo, let's get the technical stuff out of the way first: most people come for the all-you-can-eat BBQ, which is really poorly explained by the menu and servers. Basically, $20/person gets you unlimited BBQ meat and there are 6 types: pork belly, spicy pork, beef brisket, bulgogi beef, beef sirloin, and bulgogi chicken. You order 2 of these at a time. Regardless of how many people you have in your party, the $20 all-you-can eat BBQ also comes with a choice of 2 soups, banchan (Korean appetizers), 2 bowls of steamed eggs, and rice.\n\nI get that $20 is a pretty good deal for AYCE meat. The problem is that the meat is poor in quality - it has a mushy, too-soft texture. The spicy pork is especially terrifying; it actually took us awhile to realize it was pork and not chicken. You're safest going with the beef sirloin, which actually has the toothy feel of meat. That still doesn't fix the rampant over-seasoning, though - every dish (especially the bulgogi) was overpowered with salt/MSG and even after chugging liters of water I swear I was thirsty for the next 24 hours. Finally, I don't understand why 2 individuals get the same amount of appetizers as 6 - we had a party of 6 and each person was only able to get a nibble of kimchi. I suppose most people getting the AYCE aren't going for the appetizers to begin with, but that's all the more evidence for how unappealing the meat was - I found that the most tolerable items were actually the egg custard and rice.\n\nBut wait - the problems don't stop there! I don't think it would be an exaggeration to call service a catastrophe. Now, I know Asian restaurants are not known for their etiquette but there was no excuse for the absurdity we experienced. Our kimchi soup order was messed up (unfortunately for the non-pork eater in our party), we had to chase down a server for chopsticks/silverware, and even though the servers explicitly say they'll come back and take care of the BBQ-ing for you they remain mysteriously absent - I suggest you turn the meat yourself otherwise you will end up with burnt BBQ. But I'm saving the best (or worst?) for last: after paying and getting in our car, the owner of the restaurant ran outside, flagged us down as we were preparing to drive away, and insisted that we come back in and re-pay because he had screwed up the bill. Excuse me? Since when was the patron responsible for the business's mishaps?? And when is it ever appropriate to flag down customers who are driving away???\n\nHere are the conclusions I drew after my experience at Seoul Garden: this restaurant does not understand the basic components of cooking, service, or fundamental human politeness. We got in our car and drove away without looking back.",

  "text": "So glad we tried 1200 Chophouse and thrilled we finally found a go-to steakhouse. Can't wait to be back! \n\nIt's a super small beach bungalow of steakhouse.  They had a solid local craft beer and wine selection as well as full bar.  The menu was nice and small and certainly steak focused, all of which seemed to sport a nicely seared outer crust.  \n\nWe started with the bruschetta appetizer which was awesome. The bread was thinner than most bruschettas and probably the best part. The house salad and dressing was great and was nice size portion. Based on our steak preferences our server, Jeremy (who was fantastic!!) recommended a 2lb porterhouse for 2 where she'd have the filet side and i'd get the strip portion. This worked out perfectly and was just what we wanted. The steak was absolutely delicious, we looooved the crusty edge pieces and the medium rare cook was perfect. Our only complaint would pertain to the onion straws side. Being the end of the night and we clearly received what was left in the fryer basket. Essentially all over-crisped small pieces and crumbs. Pretty shotty attempt.",

  "text": "Wow! All the other Yelpers were correct that the non-fat custard here is Great!! It is not overly sweet and tastes fresh (not sure that's a word you describe custard), but comparing it to other places (like Rita's or McDonalds), you can tell the taste is not more generic.. ahh, I give up on trying to describe it, you just have to try it!! \n\nThere were also many cars in the parking lot that I was able to grab one of the last remaining open \"dedicated\" parking spaces left. There were a lot of people sitting in their cars enjoying their ice cream. While there seems to always look like a lot of people in front, the lines move quick.\n\nI got a SMALL twist cone with rainbow jimmies and it was just the perfect portion. I did not expect the Small to actually be so large, and I can't imagine how the Medium and Large sizes would be on the wafer cone or how they would stay up. One caveat with custard is that it will begin melting in seconds so you have to quickly eat it or it'll melt all over your hands! \n\nThe prices are VERY reasonable with my twist cone being $2.75 (50 cents was for the jimmies) especially for the amount you get just for a Small! I look forward to trying their flurries or sundaes, it all looks so delicious! I'm glad it is open all year round, but also glad it is not right around the corner or otherwise I would be in big trouble.. but hey, it's non-fat right? \n\nAs others have noted, Cash Only, which is okay by me.. gotta support your small businesses!",

  "text": "Located inside the gorgeous Renaissance Vinoy in downtown St. Petersburg, Marchand's Bar & Grill is a restaurant that has captivated my taste buds since my first visit almost two years ago. I have been longing to return, and had the opportunity this past week. I went with friends to taste their new Farm to Fork menu which showcases seasonal dishes made with the freshest produce, naturally raised meats and fish produced from local farms. \n\nWe started off with a savory duo of Mangalitsa \"Croque Madame\" (with Georgia Red, Fried Quail Egg) and a Silk Onion Soup Shooter. Served on a butcher block, it was a delicious way to begin our six-course meal. Deriving from a \"croque-monsieur\" (grilled ham and cheese sandwich originating from French cafès) a \"croque madame\" is a croque-monsieur served with a poached or fried egg on top. \"Mangalista\" is a curly-hair hog descended directly from wild boar populations. Thus, our ham came from Pasture Prime Family Farm in Summerfield, Florida. This was my first time tasting Georgia Red Cheese which is a semi-soft cow's milk cheese with a creamy, earthy flavor. The Silk Onion Shooter (made with Florida sweet onions) was just divine. I simply could not get enough of the Croque Madame. The ham and cheese melted together in perfect harmony on the toasted brioche and as I bit into it, the yolk from the egg blended with the ham and cheese and yielded pure yumminess. This would make a fantastic brunch item.  With this, we enjoyed a glass of Acrobat Pinot Noir. \n\nOur second course was Golden Tilefish with Romanesco Cauliflower, Sunchoke Hush Puppies and Rock Shrimp Nage. I discovered tilefish when I first moved to Tampa while working at Bonefish Grill. Love at first bite, this fish won me over with its delicate texture and flavor similar to lobster. Our dish tonight was elegantly prepared with some items that were new to me, such as romanesco cauliflower (Worden Farm) which is a visually striking Italian vegetable. Almost a cross between broccoli and cauliflower, it yields a nuttier taste. Sunchoke was the other item I was unfamiliar with and it is also known as Jerusalem artichoke. Similar to a potato, it has a slightly sweeter taste and I really enjoyed it in the form of a hush puppy. Nestled underneath the tilefish were a few rockfish which were caught off the coast of Florida. This course was paired with Hahn SLH Estate Chardonnay.\n\nNext up was Pork Cheek with Murcott Tangerine BBQ, Fried Mac & Cheese and Smoked Bacon Collard Greens. As of lately, I have been obsessed with Southern cooking and this was an excellent combination of some of my favorite flavors. The gorgeous pork cheek rested atop a glorious ball of fried mac & cheese and as I dug into the fried piece of heaven, the smoked bacon collar greens (Hunsader Farm) were snuggled underneath. The plate was drizzled with a tangy tangerine BBQ sauce and I enjoyed dipping a fork full of everything into the succulent sauce. This would end up being my favorite course of the night and it was paired with Trivento Amado Sur, a Malbec Blend. This wine was fantastic!\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with everything so far and ready for the next course, which was Key West Yellow Tail Snapper atop a Chorizo Black Bean Cake with Warm Yellow Tomato Vinaigrette. This was a nice contrast of flavors, as I found the yellow tail to be mild and the chorizo black bean cake a tad spicy. The tomato vinaigrette beautifully blended the two flavors. This was served with the Trivento Amado Sur, Torrontes, which is a unique blend of Chardonnay and Viognier and perfect pair with seafood.\n\nWe had one course left before dessert which was Braised Rabbit (Seelys Ark), Savoy Cabbage and Gold Creamer Potato Puree with a Pinot Noir Reduction. While rabbit is often gamey, I found this to be mild and with a hint of sweetness. I LOVED the potato puree (Jones Potato Farm) and the savoy cabbage. Paired with Four Vines Old Vine Cuvee Zinfandel, this was a great way to end our tasting menu before dessert.\n\nFor the grand finale, we enjoyed a dessert trio of S'mores Hazelnut Ganache torte, Caramel Oatmeal Pie and Tiramisu. Since it was my birthday eve, they brought my dessert out with candles.  The trio was fantastic and it was paired with what would be my favorite wine of the night, Santa Margarita Brut Rose. Hands down, this was the best birthday dinner I have had in years. Service was impeccable and I had a fabulous time. I am anxious to go back and explore more of this gorgeous establishment.",

Be prepared to roll up your sleeves and use a lot of napkins as the luscious juice makes a mess of you.\n\nThis is very casual dining - you're going to see a good mix of locals and tourists here.  Also, the food is just slapped down on your plate.  As Diane D. said - it's almost like a cafeteria of sorts.

  "text": "I ate here for lunch today.  We were the only people in the place and the decor made for a great first impression.  Sat in the bar area with an awesome view of a courtyard outside the restaurant.  Nice comfortable chairs, a fully stocked gorgeous bars with 2 large yet unobtrusive televisions.  The bartender was our waiter and he was great.  Brought extra ice for our iced teas, stopped by to check on us often but not enough to be annoying.\n\nI had the special of the day, a 5 ounce \"filet\" with scallops and shrimp, my friend had the 10oz flatiron steak.  She loved hers, it was served with smashed potatoes and a corn salsa.  Mine was just ok.  I loved the sauces it came with and the vegetable of the day on the side, the green beans with roasted peppers and onions.  The steak, however, was a poor excuse for a filet.  It did NOT make me want to come and try their more expensive steaks for dinner, which was my original intention.  Overall though, for the price there are better options downtown including Mike Shannon's.\n\nTo top off our meal, when we went to pay we were told our \"Dining out Downtown\" gift cards weren't good.. \"Sorry\".  WTF.. that's why we came here!!  We'd already used part of one at another restaurant earlier in the week so the problem was not the card itself.  So instead of a $30 meal I was stuck with a $75 lunch tab.  Thanks a lot Shula's.  Good luck downtown .. I won't be back!\n\nETA: I did check with Dining out Downtown (DoD) and the problem was not with our card but with Shula's system.  I then called to let them know and the manager I spoke to had never even heard of the DoD program (uhhhh.. nice.. way to go training your people!) and took my name and number to \"look into it\".  Yeah, right.  Never heard back.  I made sure to fill out a comment form on their website and I sent an email to the director of the DoD program.  This is just ridiculous.\n\nETA2: After two phone calls and a complaint form filled out online, Shula's got back to me.  They offered to give me a refund if I'd give them my credit card number again over the phone (um.. no.. ).  Instead they pretty much insulted me by sending a $50 gift card.  Ok, so lunch there cost me $75 last time.. you want me to spend my time and money driving downtown.. to spend MORE money at your restaurant?  The managers here need some serious training on their customer service.  Before all this I might have been tempted to try them again to make sure I hadn't gone on an off day?  After this.. FORGET ABOUT IT!!!!",

It's a mere three minute drive to the terminal and the only non-fast food, or greasy chain in the area where folks can grab something quick to bring with them on the plane rather than paying for poor-quality and overpriced items available in the terminal. While it might seem far fetched to some to come here with good service and better value it's a 10-minute side trip that's attractive to others. \n\nAs with all Panera's it's clean, prices are fair and there's free wifi, too. It's a great place to come kill a bit of time before a flight if you have it. Also, consider there's no risk of traffic between this location and the airport. No time on the interstate is required. Consider this next time you're coming to the airport and need a quick bite or a sandwich to bring along for the air time.",

  "text": "I used to love Boston Market when I was little. I have not been back in years. Their chicken has definitely gone down hill. But the staff here was really friendly. They were out of friend apples and had to make some extra and bring them to us. They were super hot when the arrive and I was not warned. It burned my mouth pretty good (BAD!!!) but I think I have recovered on my own and won't make an issue out of it. They brought all our food to us at our table. I do not remember that being the case when I came here back in the day. I also do not remember having plates, nor the cool cups they have for soda.\n\nEveryone was pretty happy with their food. I did the quarter white meat, loaded mashed potatoes, and fried apples. Trying to save a bit a money before seeing a movie, my fiancee and I decided to share. That is what I would always get back in the day. Well actually I would get regular mashed with gravy, I think the loaded mashed are newer. They were pretty darn good. And besides being too hot, and a couple minutes behind the rest of my food, they were also good. The chicken, while not completely terrible, definitely tasted worse than I remember. I also think the coke was a little low on syrup. \n\nOne of our friends got the chicken mashed potato bowl (or something like what they offer at KFC). She really liked it, but did not love it, and did not even finish it. She is very small and it was a big portion.\n\nOur other friend get chicken noodle soup and a sandwich. That was also something new since the last time I had been to Boston Market. He was pretty happy with his.\n\nOverall, this location is A-OK. They have friendly staff and a clean establishment. The chicken has gone down hill over the past few years, but for a quick cafeteria style corporate chain, Boston Market is just fine.",

  "text": "We came to Ocean Harbor for dim sum on July 4th. Being Chinatown, this place was open and quite packed (perhaps because other spots were closed - our first choice wasn't available). Despite having a lot of people waiting and a large party (seven), we probably didn't wait more than 15 minutes before getting a full table to ourselves. The decor is what you would expect of a dim sum spot in Chinatown - crowded, not a lot of space, loud - but you really aren't here for anything besides getting the food. With the typical shuttling around of carts carrying different items, it wasn't too long of a wait between passes to grab food for ourselves.\n\nThat said, if you are looking for dim sum that goes above and beyond, this isn't going to be the spot. The food is solidly average, with the shu mai and the lotus rice being the bites I enjoyed the most - but they were pretty standard. The general lack of dumplings were disappointing, and some options were a bit puzzling (there were only vegetarian egg rolls on the cart, for example). The beef was flavored alright but overcooked, and the pastry with gelatinous rice flour on the outside and a crisped pastry on the inside was passable. As per the usual, you get served tea and would need to ask for water separately.\n\nI wouldn't say that the food here was bad - completely edible and fine - but it doesn't stand out, and there's nothing to distinguish it from the many other dim sum restaurants that look, feel, smell and sound exactly like this one. If you absolutely need a dim sum spot, this will do, but there are a lot of other options in Chinatown as well (such as Dim Sum Garden across the street) that might be more appetizing.",

  "text": "A pretty average Chinese restaurant with dozens of standard menu items to choose from. \nSeveral lunch specials offer a good value: an entree and side with fried rice for under $6.50. \nBeef and broccoli were satisfactory with generous meat mixed in with the veggies and rice. Chicken fried rice and crab Rangoon were included. The Rangoon were wonderfully light pastries stuffed with cream filling and served hot.\nAccommodating staff: They worked with us on a special request. \nClean, bright dining room.",

They even have alcoholic alternatives for the adult in us all!\n\nI sat outside on a beautiful day, ate my alcohol infused ice cream and had a bottle of root beer soda. It was simply the best. People watching in the area is top notch and there were so many cute dogs to watch!\n\nI say try it. It's a perfect first date touch down, breezy day treat, or...just because!\n\nThanks to the owner, she was totally sweet and wonderfully quirky, like me!!\n\nHappy eating!",

She made the wait easier.\n\nSo, Acme Oyster House has a 15 dozen raw oyster challenge and initially, I got sick of the thought of 15 dozen oysters.. It's too many, I thought. And after I went, I got tough like I coulda woulda shoulda. I wished I had tried. If you don't finish it in the allotted time, you pay. If you do, you get your name on the wall and that 15 dozen is free.\n\nIf the challenge interests you at all--- DO IT!\n\nNow in the restaurant, there's table seating or the oyster bar.. With a long line outside, you get what's available and we got a table. Our server pointed out a few things on the menu and that they're famous for their Chargrilled Oysters. Yeah, the Chargrilled Oysters are sooooo fantastic. Boo Fries and Bread Pudding with Ice Cream are also recommendable..\n\nWorth the wait.",

It was tasty, but I think I still like the pistachio best!\n\nIf you come on Tuesdays, its double stamp day. 8 stamps = 1 small yogorino with 2 toppings! (Usually only comes with 1, each additional topping is 50 cents more).\n\nThis location also offers gelato. I've also been to the Yogorino on 20th street, and think the two are pretty comparable.",

As much as I adore Starbucks, sometimes I just want to kick back on a Sunday morning in a place where no one knows me or my order...especially when they offer me a free piece of Bissinger's chocolate with my order. Sold.\n\nI met up with a friend here several days ago and while waiting for her to arrive, I was offered a free sample of their homemade beignets. Whoa. Beignets this far north? How gourmet! They were utterly delightful.\n\nI ordered a doppio con panna and curled up on their couch with a copy of Sauce magazine and waited patiently for my order. As it was handed to me, the owner offered me my free piece of chocolate. Feeling a little frisky, I decided on their olive oil truffle and was not let down. Amazingly creamy and garnished with sea salt, it was the perfect pairing for my doppio. \n\nI loved the ambiance of this new cafe and am eager to return to try their savory food offerings.",

  "text": "Ocean Harbor has the best dim sum in Philly's Chinatown.  Don't be alarmed by the massive amount of people waiting on the steps when you walk in, the line usually moves pretty fast. \nThey have all the popular items like the steamed shrimp dumplings called \"Har-Gau\" in Cantonese, pork/veggie/shrimp wrapped in wonton shells- \"Siew Mai\", pork ribs in blackbean sauce-\"Pie-Gawt\", fried turnip cake-\"Lo-Bah-Gong\" and the beef in a long white noodle called \"Nu-Tsong\". Ok, ok I mixed up canto with mandarin plus my \"pinyin\" needs a lot of help but if you sound it out, you'll be on the right track! If you're not chinese and make an effort to pronounce these items your effort would be appreciated and applauded (if not, I applaud you in spirit)! They even have some entrees from the menu that they portion out and serve as dim sum. It's a good way to get a flavor of the restaurant food after dimsum hours.  What I like most about their dim sum is that I find it less oily (is that possible?) than most of the neighboring restaurants.  Another thing people forget is that the tea is such a great compliment to the food during Dimsum! I usually go for a red tea called \"Bo-Lay\" and my dining companion enjoys Chrysanthemum (I think he just enjoys saying it), this tea usually comes with sugar cubes/rocks. \nService here can be sub-par when you're in a party of two because most of the tables for 2 are hidden in corners or behind other tables so the chance of a cart of yummy foodies coming by is none. Dimsum is most enjoyable in a group, anyway. So why not grab your friends, head down to Ocean Harbor and show off some of the Chinese you just learned? (I promise none of those dishes are wacky.)",

  "text": "I finally got around to trying MEAT over the weekend. The place certainly lives up to its name as the menu features a variety of meat from brisket to chicken to ribs, and even fried chicken and sausage. I went for the brisket sandwich. The fresh baguette was piled high with pulled brisket which was smoked to perfection. It was literally melting in my mouth. However, I did not particularly care for the horseradish dressing and would have much preferred one of the four barbecue sauces made in-house. The sandwich came with a side of garlic fries, and next time I would definitely ask for them plain. They are VERY strong. Or, I would try one of the many other sides such as beans, coleslaw, or yam mash. I love the rustic wood that dominates the decor and there is a nice bar area (where I sat). I even tried bourbon for the first time. The bartender was very helpful in my choice and I found that bourbon goes very well with brisket. I will definitely return, but I think next time I will go for one of the orders of meat with a side, rather than a sandwich.",

  "text": "WOW! Love this hidden jewel! Although at first, you'll get confused of the location, but it's located in the back of the bar. So walk through the bar (must be 21+) into the back and it's a little space with about 4 tables. The menu is located on to your right on the wall a few feet away from the ordering area. \n\nAlthough was sister was slightly under the permitted age, however, the bartender said it was alright as long she was at least 18 to enter. I believe it's because there's a little tiny gaming machine so they didn't want anyone under the age to play and also the nature of the bar, but it's okay for her to be eating in the back. \n\nWe ordered two items: Firecracker Cauliflower and the Fried Catfish. Both sandwiches were absolutely phenomenal! The cauliflower had a nice tasty combo of mayo, sriracha, jalapeños, melted cheese and vinegar slaw! The catfish was crispy and seasoned well with a great combo of sriracha slaw, mayo, pickled peppers and cilantro. Love the different flavors and something very unique that you don't normally taste in a daily basis. \n\nHighly recommend this place to friends, families and also other visitors :)",

I got a side of collard greens and they were amazing as well.  \n\nFor those at the table who got the anything that said \"hot chicken\" on the menu, our waitress warned us that if you like \"Hot\" chicken wings, you should order mild.  We went with medium.  It was definitely hot.  One person at the table said that while the medium was good, he would go mild next time so he could really enjoy the chicken.\n\nThe beignets that were served with the Hot Chicken B&B were really good too.

Well let me just say I am glad I did. The person working there, Gary was super helpful. I mean the place was wall to wall products & I was clueless. He took the time to explain things & all the different products they had. People would come in & know what's up so it would be easy & quick for Gary to help them while I was looking at the products they had. I may have been overwhelmed by all these things in the store,  but once I was able to go through what they all did & how they worked it gave me a better understanding. I basically had Gary go from one side of the store to the other to give me a better idea of what the products were for. It helped me so much so I could determine what I would end up buying. Since I was traveling it was easy enough since so many things come in small packages. I probably spent way too much money but got a few things for a friend & think it was worth it.

  "text": "This is probably my family's favorite Korean restaurant in St Louis, and we've been going here for years. When we arrived I was pretty surprised at how full it was. The past few times my family came the restaurant was basically empty besides us and maybe 1 or 2 other parties. I might be imagining it but I think they might have recently gone under some renovations, which might contribute to the reinvigorated clientele.\n\nWith a party of five, we were able to successfully destroy 2 orders of appetizers along with each individual entree. For the appetizers we got the Haemul Pajeon and Goon Mandu. They're both really good, especially cause I think they make it better than my mom's. (Shhh... Don't tell her I said that.) This time around I got the Pork Bulgogi, which was also pretty good. Best thing about this place is that they give you tons of banchan (side dishes). I was smart and sat in the middle, so everything was within grasp.\n\nI'm really glad that the restaurant is doing better than before, but I will say that the service has gone downhill as a result. I'm pretty sure they forgot about one of our appetizers because we had to ask about it 10 minutes after the first one was served. They also forgot about my order because everyone else was served and I was left to picking at the banchan for at least 20 minutes. I didn't even take a picture of my food cause I immediately dug in once it got to me. With all this going on, it didn't help that the huge TV we were seated next to was showing a Korean food show. Needless to say I was drooling and hangry af. Still a great place to checkout if you're looking to fulfill your Korean food cravings.",

  "text": "This is one of those heavenly places where you are hungry, craving something unhealthy, yet want to support local places instead of those fast food chains.\n\nGATHERING PLACE\nIt may not be the shiniest building around, but after passing this outdoor-only building and always seeing a mini line, I knew I had stumbled onto a community establishment. There's always families and couples eating at the surrounding picnic tables. Sometimes I'm worried because of all the very young faces serving--but the adults are cooking in the background and the young staff has always been friendly.\n\nCOMFORT FOOD\nThe Chili Bacon Cheeseburger was fatty and gooey and looked visually unappealing but dang that bacon taste was strong. Aw--for that price there was no Fries? The much advertised Beignets were very soft and light inside, but the outside was too chewy as if it had been left out after frying. Since my teeth had to tear through, the entire thing deflated once I took a bite. There's LOTS of ice cream related goods and the workers are happy to mix together items not on the menu. My Espresso Chocolate Milkshake came in a very plain Styrofoam cup, but tasted creamy, thick and mildly chunky. It's not soft serve icy quality, but not insanely fatty either. Just right.\n\nI'LL BE BACK\nI'll admit, the burgers and desserts are not gourmet, top-notch, best-in-the-world... but I'm still going to return many times. They don't have many great combos (prepare to buy all the good stuff individually).",

The set up is also rather disorganized, although thats mostly due to customers wanting to try every type of topping beforehand, making those who do know what they want quite confused on how to order without being rude.  \nHowever, its a great addition to the area, and a great price to boot!",

I came with 3 other people, of which two got the fajita's and the other two, fish tacos or something like that. The main complaint was that everything was bland. The rice was like boiled white rice and that was it. And the fish wasn't very memorable. Also the margariita's seemed weak as well.\n\nAs for the fajita's though, there was a ton and the flavors I enjoyed. I know that this is the only dish I will order when I go there. \n\nThe second time I went, I stuck with the fajitas and again I was pleased. As a personal preference I need to remember to ask for softer peppers and onions. \n\nI wont not go here, as it is a relatively nice mexican food place that is not too far from home. The drink specials if I remember right were of good value and they also have a coupon in the Neighborhood News thing in the mail.",

  "text": "\"Wishboners.\" That's what I was hoping to see when I crossed Penn's campus and the Wishbone sign came into view. Two hastily postscripted letters from a couple of enterprising college students knocked up on Natty Lights and youthful vigor, that's all it would've taken to achieve comedy gold. But no, you goody do-rights passed on sticking it to the man and probably stuck your nose in a book. Nerds.\n\nSo the undefaced (...faced?) signage didn't satisfy my sophomoric demands, but Wishbone mostly did. Chicken fingers are boilerplate material for kid's menus and that makes it easy to dismiss them as child's play now that we're super serious Yelpers. You shouldn't.\n\nMaybe the exclusive benefit chicken tenders hold over their classically fried brothers is the meat to breading ratio. Federal Donuts is great, for example, but there are some bites where I'm only scarfing down a naked chicken bite so I can get to breaded crunch. There's a reason no one tells you about the grilled chicken place you have to check out. \n\nThe buttermilk batter and pretzel crust here demonstrate why. Tenders ($9/lb) come in white and dark. There's a healthy amount of fat and gristle in the dark meat so it's best those strips go stag without any condiments. But when you dress up the white, the pommery honey mustard is the cock of the walk. It's thick, and full of deep honey flavor. Interneting tells me this is typical of French honey mustards, in which honey is not simply a sweetener but the source of distinctive flavor. Bet you weren't expecting a French cuisine lesson amidst a chicken tender review, huh?\n\nBut a return visit will be due mostly to the mascarpone-cheddar mac & cheese. It was creamy and rich, which isn't difficult to pull off, but it also blended in a sharp edge that made it interesting. Bacon and herbs punched it up from good to great.\n \nI'll be back, and with an \"r\" and \"s\" in tow.",

  "text": "This was the best game in town for me tonight. A short layover at the dreaded \"airport hotel!\"\nI decided to order to go so I could ferry my fare back to my room and dine in comfort..\nI hadn't enjoyed a Po Boy in a few years so I splurged for a fully dressed shrimp Po Boy sandwich with a side of fries.\nThe host was very friendly and took my order promptly. In only a few minutes my much anticipated Po Boy arrived in a handy clear plastic container that was steamed inside from the heat of my gastronomical treat! I hurriedly paid for my \"airport hotel dinner\" and tipped the host. \nQuickly returning to my room, settled in and opened my clear plastic container to expose the object of my desire. There it was, atop a bed of French fries, my shrimp Po Boy mocked me! Daring me to summon the courage to add the spicy Cajun mustard and take a bite!\nI cased my Po Boy with desiring eyes before lifting one edge of the famously \"baked just right\" French bread and lavished it with the Cajun delight. I then with nervous hands carefully lifted my Po Boy and took a small sample bite. It did not disappoint! Being careful to avoid biting my fingers, I took a larger bite, which was filled with shrimp, tomato, and lettuce with the tasty Cajun mustard providing the balance to bread, shrimp, and fries!\nMy sandwich was large and satisfying, the fries more than I could dream of finishing. This \"airport hotel restaurant\" adventure was one that I'd recommend. The only reason for not rating the experience a 4 was because the server that brought my meal to me seems to have been trying to perform a quick drive by drop off to avoid any interaction with me. Maybe it was because I was salivating? Perhaps the old Pavlovian response applies to people too!\n\nIf you're ever there, go ahead, order the Po Boy!!\nI'm just saying..,",

  "text": "Reminds me of Whole foods in the US.  It's a good place for any form of a healthy option one might be looking for.  Organic fresh food is available for purchase.  A small, but decent collection of cheese, fresh cream cheese, hummus and other such dips dress the counters in the food section.  The hummus is by far the best I've had in Edmonton!  They have a good collection of organic coffees from around the world, if it interests one.  The frozeon and preserved foods available are also quite tasty and healthy (lower in sodium content) compared to other store bought preserved foods.  From a variety of fresh produce, tasty and healthy cereals, nuts and grains, teas from all over the world, to protein shakes and much more, the store is complete for all your shopping needs.  It's well located for families with young ones or in the family way.  There's an expecting mother's clothing store right next door and a children's bookstore close by.  \n\nThey also have baking/cooking classes.  You can sign up online for their newsletter with updates coming in your inbox on weekly activites, discount coupons and more.  \n\nThe only downside - I don't think it has warmed up to the average Edmontonian yet.  Of course, if you have a family of four and you'd exclusively come here for groceries, it could be too expensive. Hope they get more busy in the years to come - might drive down the costs!",

Locals love to come by boat, so if you're visiting during the day, there may be a lot of boat traffic which can be fun to watch.\n\nMy experience was that service was simply mediocre, both at the bar and once our party of six was seated.  Not to knock teenagers, but a lot of the wait staff seemed to be very young, so probably extra bodies they picked up for tourist season who are not that experienced with the job yet.  Getting our initial waters took a while, refills were slow to come, food didn't come out at the same time, etc.\n\nDrinks were mostly tourist focused; all the typical frozen ones, souvenir cups, etc.  Liquor drinks were not particularly strong or cheap.  Beer selection seems to be the average selection that the local beer distributor thinks every restaurant should have.\n\nFood-wise, the house salad nothing to write home about.  The Jalapeno Snapper is fairly tasty, but don't expect it to be spicy.  You can taste the jalapeno but I was a little let down in the end; I was expecting more 'kick'.  The scallops were quite good, but, you can get the exact same quality and size for half the price down on St Pete Beach at Willys Burgers & Booze, albeit, not with a waterfront view.  \n\nOverall, The Pub just isn't anything to write home about, literally if you're a tourist.

I do hope to keep trying to figure it out, with lots and lots of testing.\n\nZaxby's really does have some great Chicken, with lots of nice chicken related meal items.  You can get your chicken on bread, or your chicken with bread, or your chicken with chicken.. and Zalads I guess.\n\nThere are only three shake choices (Vanilla, Strawberry and Chocolate), but they are quite good.\n\nIf you are looking for a fast food Chicken option, check it out.",

I had Po Boys at Jazz fest that were 10x better. There was no messiness to them. The slaw was incredibly flavorless. I just really wasn't impressed.

  "text": "This restaurant is offers a great menu ( see photos, different from that on Yelp)but is extremely overpriced given the fact that it is one of the 2-3 dining options in the Westin La Paloma Resort and Spa.\n\nHaving arrived in the resort on a hot Arizona summer evening, I chose to have a light salad (Tomato and Watermelon) and indulge in dessert for dinner but when my salad arrived I was quite shocked seeing the portion! Though the plate looked quite pretty, it was nowhere near worth $12!!! I had requested for walnuts to be added to my salad, and it was brought without any. When I requested it a second time, a small bowl of walnuts were given on the side...\n\nThe Triple chocolate mousse dessert was the saving grace, but I do wish there were better dining options for resort guests!",

  "text": "We discovered Catahoula's after being turned away from The Village Belle on a Sunday around 3pm and almost passed right by. It doesn't come across as a restaurant because of the Catahoula sign with the dog logo on it and maybe that's why it's so special- it's def. a neighborhood gem and this little Southern Belle was more than pleased to discover the New Orleans menu, which btw, since we arrived at 3, we could choose anything from the brunch or dinner menu- an extra bonus! We've since been here several different times and have tried a majority of the menu.\n\nHushpuppies (the best- spicy and larger than usual). Ghouda Grits (um, ghouda in my grits- yes, please!). Bacon-braised Collard Greens (they don't make them w/out bacon down south!). The hubby gets a \"my burger\" all the time and loves it.  \n\nWe were there for Valentine's Day because 1) they don't change the menu to some lame V-day menu and 2) they don't take reservations. We started with the hushpuppies (delicious again!) and fried green tomatoes (cut a little too thick, but tasty and spicy with the green onion aioli) I got the blackened snapper, truffled mushroom grits, ragout of crab, leeks, fennel & creole tomatoes and the hubby got the duck jambalaya (he loved it). \n\nOur favorite thing to do here is to order the peel-n-eat shrimp in creole spices/oil and a side of the ghouda grits. Peel some shrimp, put that on the grits, and then dip a forkful in to the oil. You will be praising little baby Jesus that you read this and tried it. I've never had their version of the shrimp and grits because this is honestly all I can think of. In fact, you can make a meal out of that alone between two people and be pretty satisfied!\n\nGreat beer list, too, (I love Abita brews!) and the service is always nice and casual (in a good way).\n\nSpecial note: There are about 7 tables in the restaurant, so I would choose a not-so-busy time if you don't want to wait. The bar is long though, and usually has seating available. There's also an awesome patio!",

I had no idea what to expect, but I have to say that I was surprised how \"upscale\" the whole experience felt.  The inside looks really nice and there's comfortable leather chairs around the tables and comfortable leather sofas also.  This would be a great place to crack open a laptop and get some work done.  The area where you order has large display panels that list all of the drink options.  The big problem I had was that I had no idea what a lot of the choices were.  When I read \"Jelly Wow Milk\" it elicited a \"Huh?\" from me.  Their website isn't any help either.  It just lists the same items with no descriptions.  I ended up going with a passion fruit slush and I really liked it.  I now know that you can select from one of four levels to indicate how much sugar (if any) you want, which I think is great.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of their more exotic flavors.",

I don't know how else to explain what I mean, but their sushi really didn't taste... like sushi. \n\nThe spicy eskimo roll sounded delicious, but just ended up tasting like a ham sandwich. Yes, a ham sandwich.  The spicy tuna roll just kinda tasted like cold rice and sriracha.  The spicy butterfly roll was completely forgettable and tasted almost artificial in flavor.

Maybe a case of extreme freezer-burn or just bad fish?  \n\nDefinitely skipping next time I'm back in St. Louis \n\n(Quick disclaimer for those interested - I've lived all over the world and had sushi at hundreds of different places and multiple countries and I've had some of the best sushi ever in Colorado.

  "text": "Dewey's is great for lunch or dinner. The Ellisville Dewey's is my home base, but I went to the Kirkwood Dewey's for lunch today and found them exactly the same. I have tried what feels like everything on the Dewey's menu, so I feel like I could go on and on about all the good choices. \n\nTips on Dewey's for first-timers:\n-Pizzas are 11\" 13\" or 17\" and can be split half and half. You can sub out one topping for another (say, minus the green peppers and add bacon on the Billy Goat. Hint hint. Try it you'll thank me). The 11\" is good for two people, and the 17\" is actually more pizza than two elevens and is cheaper. Deal!\n-Salads are \"side\" or \"regular\" and the regular can easily be split between two (they bring you extra plates).\n-Pizzas are red sauce or white sauce, white being olive oil, minced garlic, mozzarella, and fontina cheeses. Both rock.\n-They do wine and beer, rotating through a few seasonals. From what I can tell they have Rogue Dead Guy Ale and Guinness on tap year round. The Kung Fu Girl Riesling is delish. \n-Everything is crazy fresh. This is not pizza hut toppings.\n\nBest of the best:\n-Candied Walnut and Grape Salad: field greens, candied walnuts, red grapes, gorgonzola, and citrus basil vinaigrette. To die for. I challenge you to find a better salad combination!\n-House Salad: field greens, craisins, pine nuts, goat cheese and creamy balsamic vinaigrette. The Shaved Duck does almost the exact same salad for their house.\n-Strawberry Macadamia Nut (Summer) and Harvest (Fall), which has figs AND boursin cheese AND applewood smoked bacon (yeah they did that) are both killer.\n-Green Lantern: red sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms, goat cheese, artichokes, and pesto. The best pizza I have EVER had. \n-The Caprice, Southwest BBQ, Billy Goat, and Socrates Revenge are my other favorites. \n\nThey do \"team service\" so you're certain to have ten people clamoring to refill your drinks. The final word is you really can't go wrong with anything (except the Greek salad, which is yuck) so head on over.",

However, I am unsure why the rule is \"appetizer or salad, soup and entree\" but you cannot get an appetizer, salad and entree. Silly.\n\nI started with the tom yum veggie soup, which was spicy but somehow managed to be \"light\" in consistency. Tasted very homemade, which was great.\n\nI continued with a spring roll. Good. Basic. I've never had a bad spring roll, have you? \n\nMy entree was pad see iew, my favorite thai noodle dish by far. The actual quality of the noodles was awesome- you could tell they were hand cut. No mushiness, no clumps. The veggies were fresh and the flavor was good, but it was very low key. Nothing popped, nothing sizzled, and what the heck is cauliflower doing in there? Inapprops. \n\nI would definitely come back to Sawatdee, but if you're looking for bold flavors and lots of spice (like I often am), trek a mile or so south and order from Circles.",

  "text": "Wow.  Just wow.  Little Nonna's is so spectacular.  This tiny Italian restaurant packs so much complexity and flavor into every morsel it serves.  \n\nI had the pleasure of dining at Little Nonna's on a Thursday evening.  It was early, but the place was packed solid -- which is probably a common occurrence, since the restaurant is teeny-tiny.  Thankfully, I was able to snag one of the last available first-come-first-serve seats at the back counter, overlooking the kitchen.\n\nThe server dropped by to grab my drink order.  I always try to have wine with Italian food, and she recommended an inexpensive yet tasty Pinot Grigio. -- not too sweet, perfect for sipping, and pairs well with most things.\n\nShe also told me that the best way for a newbie to experience Little Nonna's is to resist the temptation to fill up on a large pasta dish and, instead, try a sampling of their smaller plates.  So that's what I did.\n\nFirst course was a plate of wild mushroom arancini (a.k.a. deep-fried risotto balls).  This dish was mind-blowingly delicious.  It's the best risotto I've ever had, and it's probably one of the best Italian dishes *of any kind* I've ever had.  These balls were simultaneously crispy, creamy, savory, sweet -- the total gastronomic package.\n\nNext up was the eggplant parmesan.  This dish is nothing like the heavy, one-note eggplant parmesan served elsewhere, where you can't even identify the eggplant in a sea of breading, cheese, and grease.  Nope -- Nonna makes the eggplant the star, with just enough breading to provide crisp and just enough cheese provide layers of flavor.  This dish let the eggplant shine, and I loved it.\n\nTo finish the meal, I had the tiramisu, which was also total perfection.  It was served beautifully, towering high in a large teacup.  The flavors were perfect, and not to sweet either.  I loved the touch of fresh hazelnuts, which gave this tiramisu a contrasting crunchy texture that other tiramisus lack.  \n\nTo say I love Little Nonna's is an understatement.  If I lived in the area, I'd be dining here over and over again.  It's the real deal -- check it out for yourself!",

  "text": "I want to preface this by saying that I ranked it 4/5, but the experience was more like a 3.5/5 or 7/10. It's got a lot of kinks to iron out because the place is new. Right now it's just an insanely expensive average experience. \n\nThis is the new restaurant in the JW, Ice District. Finding this place is difficult, as they have parking but at the moment it's not really complete. I'm here to save the day though, and get you through this maze. You park in the underground parkade off 103 Ave, near Stantec tower. If you blink you will miss this parkade due to construction all around it, so keep your eyes out. After that, go into the parkade, up to the main lobby of the Stantec, and it is directly across the street. Don't try to go in through the patio doors, they keep them locked. Go around the building to the front of the JW and then you will see it. There is a lobby bar, walk past the lobby bar and you are there. I feel the need to explain this because getting here was definitely a bit crazy. But, hey, free parking!\n\nSo we get to the hostess stand, get checked in (you need to give your license plate for the parkade), and the restaurant itself is behind the wine wall! The decor is beautiful! We were seated at a nice four-person table, chairs were very comfortable! I just felt very fancy. If you guys know me, you know I like to pretend to be fancy when I'm actually not (lol).\n\nOur server was awesome, when she was there. She was running around like a mad-woman trying to handle all her tables. She did a great job considering the circumstances. It took about a half hour for her to get our wine to us, which is a pretty long time considering that we hadn't even ordered our food before our wine. It was at this point that I knew we were in for a rough 3-3.5 hours. But I get it, it's ironing out the kinks. \n\nWe ordered a Burgundy ($84) and a Gamay Noir - the Gamay was the least expensive ($58), however, I think you're pretty safe in ordering any wine that is on the \"cheap\" side because the price doesn't really matter. It is very clear that they have spent the time to carefully construct their gorgeous wine menu! When looking through it I could tell that you're basically safe with any wine because of the time and care it takes to create a menu like that. All stunning wines and different varieties. I obviously preferred the Burgundy because I'm a boss, but the Gamay was delicious as well.\n\nI take a big issue with the size of the font on the menu. I mean, come on, why do I need a magnifying glass to read this? You have so much space and should make the font bigger! Even our server was squinting trying to read which items/wines we were trying to order. I totally get wanting to have a nice aesthetic, but this is hurts my eyes. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of menu items to try, the Chargrilled Salmon, the Cauliflower, Onion Rings, Fried Squid, Hamachi Sashimi, mashed potatoes and the Rib Eye. I'm a pescatarian/mostly plant-based, so I did not try the Rib Eye. I was very impressed by the Chargrilled Salmon and the Cauliflower dishes. But I was totally taken aback by how BOMB the mashed potatoes were. I had to laugh because they totally stole the show for me. YUM! I was very pleased with the Salmon and Cauliflower as well. \n\nFor dessert we order this Black Forest Eton Mess Sundae and it was so underwhelming. That was my least favourite part of the meal. It looks like you're about to stuff your face with delicious brownies. But what it actually is, is layers of whipped cream and a tiny bit of ice cream, brownies and cookies and a bunch of maraschino cherries to fill the space. Two big slices of some kind of merengue to make it seem like it isn't just a bowl of whipped cream. For $21, you're better off going home. \n\nSo yeah, kind of an average experience for the first time. I'm definitely going to come back in a few months when they iron out the kinks. I like the space and I want to give it the shot it deserves. You can tell they put a lot of work into it. Right now, however, it needs some work. I wouldn't make it a regular spot until the future. \n\nI will, however, be back to spend a bunch of $$$ when I recover from this.",

A very solid three.  \n\nWhen we first walked in, they had no record of my reservation (that I had called in on Wednesday for Saturday night), but they were able to accommodate my party of four without a wait.  From beginning to end, I enjoyed the food.  I had the \"Land and Sea\" hibachi and it came with soup, salad, some appetizer shrimp, and ice cream for dessert.  I felt that the price was reasonable given the amount of food and \"the show.\"  \n\nOur hibachi guy was excellent -- he worked quickly and kept two little kids at a party next to us very entertained and engaged (to the point where we hardly noticed we had kids at our table).  I would have liked if our waitress came back to the table more frequently to check on the drinks -- she forgot water that I asked for and I sat with an empty beer for a good long while before she showed up again to offer another.  They had a decent selection of Japanese beers, which was a definite plus as you don't see that around very often.\n\nAs weird as this sounds, I would recommend dressing in layers.  It's cold in there, but it heats up when they start cooking at your table.  Once they shut the stove top off, you're back to fairly chilly while you eat your cold ice cream.  Be prepared if you're sensitive to temperature.",

It's going to be the same boring flavors.. but I was proved wrong! The first time I went I ordered a flatbread and the kind owner came by and asked us if we wanted any of the house sauces. By far, these are the best sauces on the planet. NO PLACE can ever make sauces like these. Last night, my boyfriend and I ate a pizza there, the ham was so succulent and fresh while the pizza, although thick, had the right amount of crunch to it! The owner joked around with my boyfriend and I, and honestly the amazing customer service and the pizza made me love this place even more! This is definitely on my top three places to eat!",

  "text": "I was actually surprised with how tasty my meal was! Visiting Reno twice a month for work I've come to enjoy staying at The Peppermill, this however was my first time eating at Oceano. After a 5 minute wait I was seated at the sushi bar and asked if I wanted to do the all you can eat sushi. I'm all about sushi but something about sushi in Reno with the \"all you can eat\" slogan behind it turned me off. Everyone to the right of me was gobbling up some sushi but I settled for the wood grilled halibut with potatoes and loads of veggies. The meal as I stated in my first sentence was quite tasty, the halibut had a nice wood flavor to it and was seasoned really well. My veggies could have been cooked a bit longer but that's more of a preference than anything else. Overall good service, good menu and I will definitely be back!",

  "text": "I was expecting something amazing when I saw the rating of 4 stars for Nori Thai. It was good, but nothing that blew me away.\n\nThe place itself is very small. I almost felt like the couple seated next to use were part of my table. I could easily join in their conversation. Everyone who works there seems friendly enough, though. They seem to know their regulars and serve up smiles and jokes. Or maybe the customers there weren't even regulars, and the servers are really that friendly.\n\nI ordered the massaman curry mild, and the boyfriend ordered tofu pad thai. Two dishes that I feel should be solid enough to make a judgment on a Thai restaurant. The curry was good. I was afraid mild may still be too spicy for me, but it was just right. Really good portion too; just enough where I was able to finish it but not feel too stuffed. I wasn't a fan of the pad thai, though. It was too sweet for my taste, and the noodles seemed overcooked. Too chewy.\n\nIf I hadn't been full from our meal and tempura appetizer (which was typical tasting), I would have liked to try one of their desserts, especially the sticky rice with mango. It's something you don't see on every menu.",

  "text": "Good Indian food in East Philly? What? Yeahh, its true.  This restaurant is right behind a motel (America's best something), so don't blink or you'll miss out.  \n\nI went with a Desi (Indian-American) friend who said this place was great -which it was.  It's a big place, very well decorated, with dimly lit lights and indian music in the background.  The service is very good, waiters very friendly. Since my friend recommeded the place and i'm sure had a lot more experience with indian food than i did - i let him order. We had: \n\nMasala Paneer (Cheese in Tomato sauce)  - The sauce on this platter was awesome... I'm not a big cheese eater but this plate was soo flavorful. He ordered the spicy which I was like - SPicy? What does spicy mean - because my level of spice tolerance and indian level are very different.  It actually was a tolerable spicy though.\nAloo Gobi (Potatoes and Cauliflower) - Another great amazing dish - the sauce was incredible - the plate all together was very flavorful.. \nGarlic Naan - Mmm..\n\nAlso, this was my first time drinking King Fisher beer (lager). It was really good and ice cold!\n\nThese two dishes, naan and rice were more than enough food for two people.  Definitely recommended if your in the area or not.   FYI - It's not cheap - it came out to like $50 for two people.",

  "text": "As we walked up to Reef I counted the places doing Sushi within 5 blocks.  I think I counted a total of four, the one in Harrah's, the one serving Thai, the one in Sienna and now Reef.  This seems a little more density than can be sustained.  And quite possibly this will lead to one of these places closing down.  But for now, we have the \"Modern Age\" of All-You-Can-Eat sushi in Reno. The golden age has passed.  The first strong originators are either closed or way past their prime.  So now, looking forward, what else can we do but wonder...how can it be improved?  How can it be revisited and bring a fresh take on AYCE sushi, something Reno knows more about than probably any other city in North America?\n\nReef seems to be willing to take up that challenge.  The challenge to bring us the AYCE sushi we know and love, while still giving us a reason to forgo our regular sushi bars and give and them a try.\n\nAt the outset you notice new \"take\" in the theme of the restaurant.  The gentle Hawaiian music playing adds to the visual atmosphere.  Of course being new, everything is clean and sharp and not worn, but it's also very pleasing.  For me, it attains a nice balance between casual and upscale.  They have cloth napkins on one hand, but a soda fountain in view from the bar.  This could easily be a date place and yet still a good place to go when you don't feel like all the pomp and circumstance of a fancy \"date night\".  They did have two large screen TV's above the bar but they weren't on when we arrived.  Not sure if they plan on having them on all the time or if they just plan on using them during lunch hours.\n  \nThe service was soft opening service.  If anything was slow or a bit \"off\", it was easily chalked up to the soft opening learning curve.  However everyone was friendly and helpful.  And in all frankness, I've gotten much poorer service at some of the currently established restaurants.  The wait staff was prompt and quick at filling waters, sodas and clearing plates.\n  \nAnd now finally we get to the sushi.  The sushi was quality and the variety seemed to reflect all the different places in Reno.  They have taken all the good stuff and put it under one roof.\n\nMahalo Roll\nMt Fuji Roll\nSurf and Turf Roll (my wife's favorite)\nYellowtail Nigiri\nMaguro Nigiri\nSalmon Nigiri\nSpicy Bomb\nBBQ Seared Tuna\nDonald\nMickey\nCrab Handroll\nQuail Egg Shooters\nUpside Down Shrimp\nSpicy Tuna Upside down Shrimp\nCrab Cakes\nCoconut Shrimp\nPotstickers\nMussels\nStrawberry Parfait\nTempura Banana with Ice Cream\nTempura Peach with Ice Cream\n\nI'm not gonna review everything, but instead...\nBest Mussels in Reno.  Not tough and chewy, but still properly cooked.\nBest Desserts offered with an All You Can Eat (the good green tea ice cream is served here)\nNon-Soy Sauce based Quail Egg Shooters\nWarning: Spicy doesn't seem prominently featured. But I'm sure you can have them spice stuff up.\n\nIf they can maintain this level of quality and price and service I don't see them having any problems succeeding.  And IF they do, this very well could take the throne as the \"Best in Reno\".\n\nThe grand opening isn't until Monday 3/25/13.  \nThey sadly serve Coke products.\nThey seem to have an extensive Sake menu.\nA variety of Tea offerings.\nDinner Price was paid at $25.95 per person.\nLunch is $17.95 per person.\nUnder 12 AYCE is $9.95.",

The first 500 visitors got bags of free samples, and they had plenty of branded promo items like buttons, sunglasses and reusable bags for everyone. The parking lot is pretty big but there is only one way in and out so it will be interesting to see how crowded things get when students get back to campus, it's finals week now and campus has died down quite a bit.

They have some sit down tables and some long bar style tables you stand at.  They need a few more chairs inside.  It was still too hot to sit outside and eat at a few of their side walk tables.\n\nDessert - They are known for their ice cream sandwiches.  I am all about snickerdoodles so I was glad to see them.  So I picked the snickerdoodle as my top and bottom cookies.  Now I need to figure out which ice cream will go with the cookies.  Simple and clean to let that cinnamon to come out.  Vanilla of course.  I did not need a \"topping\", the little something they stick on the side of your ice cream that is visible.  The cookie was solid one the best snickerdoodles I have, which I was surprised by.  Freshness is something they stress there and it pays off.  I think they should suggest some suggested combos for those who can not make their minds up.  Perhaps my daughter's combo of funfetti cookies with bear batter ice cream topped with sprinkles could be the \"classic kid sandwich\".\n\nService - Friendly staff.  The concept is simple so they need to execute with perfection.\n\nFuture - Desserts like this are always a special treat, so yes but not often.",

The place is tiny so make sure you make a reservation.  We got there at 5:30 on Saturday without a reservation but were told that we had to leave before 7:00 because the table we were at was reserved.  Not a big deal!  They were honest up front.  Take it or leave it!\n\nThe restaurant does have a bar but the drinks are so so.  I didn't come for the drinks though.  To start off, the house salad that is served family style is just amazing.  My father in law who's diet consists of steak, bread, and pepsi even eats it.  Don't forget to get the cheese!\n\nI ended up getting the crabcake appetizer that was served with roasted red cabbage and bacon, drizzled with a balsamic dressing.  A++ I didn't think I was going to like the red cabbage, but I can't get it out of my head.  There was this sweetness to it that I can't really explain.  You will have to just try it.  And you can't go wrong with bacon.  The crabcake had nice chunks of lump meat and barely any filler.  One of the best crabcakes I've had in a while.\n\nThe others ordered baked penne with meatballs, shrimp scampi, and manicotti.  The table was pretty much silent as everyone dug in.  You definitely get your money's worth.  Everyone had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  Graziano's is definitely on the top of my list when it comes to Italian eateries.  Food was great! Company was great! A nice little step back into time.  We all left happy.",

New Orleans people seem to love American cheese for some bizarre reason. It came with grits and a biscuit. Everything was really tasty, and the service was very friendly. They didn't even seem annoyed with me staring longingly at the kitchen waiting for my food! I would definitely come back and try something with debris the next time I'm in town.",

The restaurant was empty, but we were seated only after a few mins, because the staff were still setting up. \n\nWe tried to place order for the $26.95 prime rib dinner that they advertised in the hotel room booklet, but not listed in the menu. I checked with our waiter, a Vietnamese dude named Benam, that it was available 3 times before I place the order. He assured us it is available. Guess what, more than 15 mins later, after we were served the soup, he told us it was not available, and to choose a different entree. It was too late by then for us to leave the restuarant, since we already drank the soup (part of the dinner set). \n\n \n\nFine, we chose different entrees. To be fair, they tasted decent.\n\nWe also ordered a mac and cheese after seeing the pic of it on yelp. We got a shock when we were serve KRAFT mac and cheese. When we asked the waiter, Benam, about it, he said that their $8 mac and cheese has always been like that, because it is for kids. Right. When we ask if we can just cancel the order since we didn't touch it yet, he rolled his eyes and brought the dish away after staring at us. I'm not sorry that I refuse to pay $8 for something that cost less than $2 (we were not even serve the entire box. Lol?)\n\nObviously the dinner turned out really awkward because Benam became the ultimate queen bitch after that. Cleared our dishes loudly after asking rudely if we are done. When it came to choosing dessert, when my husband ask for bread pudding, he sarcastically said oh, are you sure, because I don't think I can trust you now. WTF. \n\nI was really worried that the staff might spit in our dessert after that. But my husband said that I should have more faith. I am writing the yelp review at the table, while eating my dessert skeptically. Can't wait, because my blood is freaking boiling. I rarely write bad reviews, most of my reviews are 4 or 5 stars, but this 1 star is freaking deserving.\n\nI left tipping Benam, your highness, $8 to thank him for removing the mac and cheese from our orders. If I had thicker skin, I wouldn't have tipped at all.\n\nEdit: husband spoke to the manager and she apologized.

The chance to get to see these true artist conduct a symphony of food as you order...can't be beat. An opportunity that won't be soon forgotten by us!! \n\nSat for a late brunch.

  "text": "Hm, I wasn't sure what rating to give this place. The food was delicious but the service was terrible, which is why I couldn't bring myself to give it the 5 stars the food may deserve.\n\nMy boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night around 6:45pm since we had a restaurant.com gift certificate. The place was very empty, although it says it's open till past midnight and there was supposedly a WashU party going on later that night.. In any case, we were the only customers in the place for a while and it was a bit awkward at times.\n\nThe lady serving us was nice at first, and she reminded us that since we were using the gift certificate, they were giving us $25 of their money for us to enjoy their meal. We smiled politely and checked out the menu.\n\nAfter she left, a guy (we assumed he was the owner) came over to us and began inquiring about us in the most awkward way imaginable. He stood over us asking what schools we went to, what we studied, and what nationalities we were. The conversation definitely wasn't flowing, especially since when we tried to ask him a question he interrupted us to ask another one.. hm. \n\nHe also then reiterated the fact that since we were using the gift certificate he was covering $25 of our meal. We smiled politely once again, slightly peeved this time...\n\nThe items on the menu were so cheap and since there were only 2 of us, it was actually difficult to get our bill to the minimum of $35 in order to use the certificate. For the amount that we got, we were pleasantly surprised at the prices. The appetizers were less than $5, the specials were about $15 and everything else was in between. They could definitely charge more if they wanted to, although I'm glad they don't!\n\nWe ended up ordering the samboosa appetizer which I wasn't particularly impressed by (think semi-bland spring roll stuffed with ground beef and a mildly spicy sauce to go with it) and a glass of honey wine which is definitely a kick in the mouth. It kicked me a bit too hard but my boyfriend loved it.\n\nWe ordered the goat curry chef's special (a giant plate of goat curry with rice) and my boyfriend enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought it was good but my lamb tibs were better; lamb chunks with onions and hot peppers in a flatbread, similar to the bread we tried in an Ethiopian restaurant (but less sour) with a delicious side salad. \n\nWe definitely enjoyed the meal and were stuffed by the end of it. When the lady came by with the bill, she stood over us and tried to convince us to order more appetizers. We told her we were stuffed and would like the check. She told us to order another appetizer to qualify for the gift certificate. We told her that we had calculated the cost already and we knew it was over $35. \nAt that point she reluctantly handed over the bill and rudely said 'well, your total comes to $36, and we're paying for $25 of that, so you should order something else, but I guess that's fine, you want to be cheap, whatever.' \nThen she walked away and stood on the side sulking while we paid. \n\nI assume restaurants put certificates up on restaurant.com in order to raise awareness of their food and so people will want to try it out and come again regardless of a coupon!\nI have never experienced this in any restaurant in my entire life.. although I do realize that it's a cultural difference. Americans are great with customer service, but I have been to many other countries and eaten at many different cuisines with mostly terrible service and delicious food. This was still the worst though.\n\nThe food was delicious but I'm not sure I'd want to deal with that service again.",

  "text": "I came to Deacons for a Saturday morning brunch. The vibe is man cave chic with bold fixtures, deep undertones, and nice wood. The menu for brunch was stuffier than I typically prefer such as French style omelettes so I got the burger. Now this burger was the James Beard Competition burger so I had to go for it. It was a prime beef patty with ground shiitake and cremini mushrooms blended in. The patty had a distinct aftertaste that was not pleasant, probably from too many creminis as apparently the burger is 25% mushroom. There was a fresh pesto on the bottom bun and aioli on the top. Halumi cheese and arugula also complimented the burger. The burger was rich and the flavors were competing to be the boldest which meant nobody won. I asked for a tomato to attempt to cut through the richness with some acid and this helped. I ate half of the burger and I never eat half of anything lol but I was on a date and did not want to seem as a complainer. Instead I ate a good amount of my date's burger which was the Deacon's Classic Burger. It was an elevated Big Mac and boy was it juicy and flavorful. I will return to eat the Classic for sure.",

The fish was light and flakey.  Small flakes, which made it a little tough to eat around the bones, but the sweet preparation was excellent and complemented the fish perfectly.\n\nI also was able to try the duck, which had a very light BBQ flavor.  The duck wasn't too fatty, but had just enough to make it nice and tender.  \n\nThe service was excellent.  Informative and very friendly, with a light touch.\n\nI'll be back.",

This place is a very small hole in the wall that, if you're driving and you blink, you'll miss it. There is very limited parking so be ready to look around if you can't find any in the lot!\n\nThe interior of this place is really cool and themed with the copious amounts of old candy, that it'll make you forget you're in 2019. The prices for the candy here are ridiculously reasonable and they even offer bulk candy and candy by the pound.\n\nThe ice cream is the best thing about this place though, I got the strawberry oreo ice cream and it was delicious! It was the perfect amount of creamy and for $4 the amount you get is insane! They have many different flavors such as butter pecan and coffee&doughnuts so be ready to have choices!\n\nIt is a very small place with MAYBE 7-8 people being able to be inside at one time.

  "text": "This review should be a 4* just based on the drinks and their amazing patio alone, but the service tends to get in the way of that 4th star much of the time. \nService: \nThe servers are usually friendly and helpful in figuring out what to order but man once that order is in... crickets.... no server, no service. Empty water and beer glasses and if the food didn't come out  perfect... good luck getting a hold of the server before it's cold. \nFood:\nAs mentioned above the food needs some attention a lot of the time once it arrives. Ie improper protein cook temps, no sauce, no dressing, wrong side and sometimes \"this isn't what I ordered\".  When and if the food is corrected it's usually pretty darn good. I don't think I've ever got the same thing twice just because I'm always looking to try something new.\nPricing:\nI think for a lot of the menu (which is a good size menu too) the pricing is appropriate but for the salads and burgers it can be a bit high for what you end up with. \nSo if these guys would spend a bit more attention to the small details this would easily be a 4 or possibly even a 5 star review.",

  "text": "Yelp reviews on this place made me want to check this out with my lunch buddy.  This cute fast food type of place was located right off Rittenhouse square.  There are a bunch of tables but they were all taken.  The line was out the door.\n\n4 kiosks were available to take your order.  First I thought \"how impersonal\" then I thought \"ohhh my order should be perfect\".   It was perfect.  The wait was not very long to order my food or to wait for my custom meal.\n\nI decided to 'Create my Own\"  I had egg white noodles with chicken, mushroom, bean sprouts, bell peppers, roasted cashews, cucumbers and lite soy sauce.      They definitely could have used more chicken as I barely saw it in my container.   Tons of noodle.  Although I said lite sauce I still had a bunch of bottom of my container (I wonder if it's light sauce).  It was very tasty.  The portion was huge so I tossed about a third.  There is only so much noodles a girl can eat in one sitting.\n\nMy buddy had tofu, brown rice, pepper, broccoli, carrots, pineapple, scallions, cilantro and red coco curry sauce.   She really loved it.  She wants this to be one of our regular lunch spots.  I agree.\n\nPrice is reasonable - a bit under $10 for each of us.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and they had one person cleaning tables and talking to guests.  \n\nThere was plenty of staff working behind the counter/grill.\n\nWe will be back.",

I didn't know what I was going to get with each bite until it was too late. The fried jalapenos were delicious on top -- however, the chips, the whole point of the entree, really made it annoying...\n\nWe do intend to go back and give this establishment another try - and I will update my review then. \n\nThe people next to us all ordered Monte Cristos and raved about them, perhaps, that is something to consider next time...",

The food truck craze always has me craving tacos so how perfect was this. The place itself is.....spartan to say the least. It's an old trailer that is hopefully anchored down in some way. But maybe not. Anyway I decided to try the \"lengua\" or tongue tacos and a basket of chips and salsa. We brought our selections back to C.Beevers and chowed down. I scarfed mine because they were so good. The chips and salsa were great too. I will def come back and get some grub to go. BTW they sell beer too.",

  "text": "ASB was worth every cent of my $11 Uber ride from Fairmount.\n\nMotivated by their California-centric brew event, our group of ~10 [Yelpers and friends] arrived and settled into a big booth next to the bar. For the next few hours, we managed to order most of the beers on their special list (Hey pretty Almanac! Love you, Ballast Point and Alesmith!) while also getting a taste of their regular food menu.\n\nI went with the pulled pork sandwich. Definitely not my usual meal choice, but theirs was pretty interesting in its own way. As Steph S. put it, the sandwich somehow paralleled a cheesesteak in taste. I liked it!\n\nAfter eating, some of us went outside for a bit. It was a cool night, their fire pits were ablaze and the bar was decorated colorfully with classic lights. So nice.\n\nPoint Breeze isn't a neighborhood I visit all too often, but I'd be happy to return and explore more of ASB's menu and draft choices in the future!",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I were around this area looking for a place to eat. He enjoys meat, and this place had good reviews so we came here to try it out!!\nWe are so glad we were able to give this place a try. It has a different vibe than any other restaurants I've ever been to. It is in a garage but the owner renovated it to a restaurant (at least that's what I think).\nParking was relatively very easy to find but there are also parking in front of the restaurant. \nOnce you step in, there is seating by the \"bar\" and tables on the side. There is a rack to hang your coats on. On Thursdays, they have a AYCE buffet for $12! And additional $8 for half a rack of ribs. I don't have a big stomach so I usually share a meal with my boyfriend and we get an appetizer on the side. (We had chick-fil-A 2 hours before) so I was even less hungry!\nToday, we had the baby back- ribs platter. \nThe meat was so tender, it fell off the bones!! It was delicious yummmmy!!\nThe fries were great, and so was the coleslaw. \nThe corn bread was different from any other corn bread I've tried. It seems like there was honey or maple syrup of some sort drizzled on top making it even more delicious.\nThe staff here is incredibly attentive and nice. Dan was our host and he was very very nice. He was always attentive making sure we were doing good. Additionally, there was a group of men sitting on the table next to us. And I remember someone ordered baby back but to him, it seemed as if it were spare ribs. And another worker(?) or host(?) was seriously the sweetest. He didn't even argue and said the customer is always right. And not even in a rude way. But he was super sweet, took the plate back and brought another plate! From my experience as a customer, no one was ever that sincere. But Dan and the mystery man!!! Deke, if you read this or hear from this, you have yourself an amazing staff.",

Although not listed on the menu, I asked the server and they had three options hidden in the back. There was coconut, turtle and a choco-chip cherry option. I liked the sounds of all three, but went for the choco-chip cherry. For something without dairy it was even better than what was in the counter freezer (I know because I snuck in a few bites from my dates waffle bowl).\n\nHad I been able to really indulge in true ice cream, I would have chosen pistachio or the 3X caramel.\n\nThe decor echoes the history of the Monon Trail right outside the store's backdoor. The colors are cheerful and the safe is friendly. The entire store, including restroom, was very clean.\n\nWe chose to eat inside, because little critters have really taken a liking to me as a snack this summer. Otherwise I would have had my treat on the spacious patio this fine summer evening.\n\nThis was my first visit to BRICS and I will be back!",

Shake shack is like the cadillac of fast food restaurants - it's quick and carry to your table style, but the food isn't greasy or waiting for you when you walk in the door. Don't get me wrong, this meal is heavy and calorie-filled but it's worth it. I am a fan of the fries - nothing wrong with the crinkle cut - the shack burger and the shroom burger. All great options. I've never had one of the custards or milkshakes because they're too heavy from the looks of it, but they look phenomenal! Love this place!",

I've always had a blast here. Its near by the water so the temperatures are significantly lower here. Come prepared, wear layers and it'll serve too purposes. It'll keep you warm and keep you from getting hurt when you fall. \n\nThe lobby has some good hot chocolate if you need a break and want to warm up. They also have games for people who don't want to skate and even Karaoke! \n\nThis is a good place to bring a date or come with a group of people who can't skate. Its fun to watch everyone fall. The pros usually skate in the middle of the rink while newcomers stay to the edges to hold on for dear life. It does get crowded on some theme nights such as Valentines day when the ice is colored red and slow music is playing. Its very romantic if that's what you're looking for. \n\nMost importantly, its affordable and fun.",

  "text": "We read some pretty good reviews of this place, and a friend said the sushi is good, but to be aware that the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. After having dinner there, I'm in agreement that while the food is really good, the service and ambiance are not so great.\n\nWhen we arrived, there was no one behind the host desk, and when the hostess finally did see us, she almost seemed to wave us off. It took us a while to get a table since they were pretty full.\n\nAfter finally getting a table, it took a while for someone to come take our order for the all-you-can-eat sushi, and some more time for the food to arrive. Fortunately, they were pretty good about refilling water and such, but I think they're just understaffed. It was a full house, but there were only three servers taking care of all the tables.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, it's not very pretty. The interior looks a bit worn, and they seem to throw things together as needed. Some random pieces of artwork here and there. The bathroom is pretty clean, but just room for one. Fairly reasonable for the size of the restaurant, though.\n\nAll of this said, I will say that the food is quite good. The sushi is fresh, and the rolls are tasty. I'm also a fan of their green tea ice cream. Their all-you-can-eat sushi is $21, which is a really good price.\n\nOverall, not bad if you want some good sushi at a good price, but be prepared to wait. And... probably not the best for a first date.",

The service staff did not give me a choice between wing and leg, and for over $8, I expected a better value. Corn bread was barely warm and hard around the edges, but chicken was hot and juicy. \nHere's my main beef: I expected more, judging by all the love from my colleagues and the name recognition, but when all was said and done, I left with a 'this is it??' kind of impression.\n\nNice ambience and clean shop, I just wish they had proven me wrong in thinking it must be \"just another chain restaurant.\"\n\nI would not consider going back.",

So 4 stars is the best it could get for this visit.\n\nExcellent ribeye steak, tremendous flavor without being overly fatty. Good sear on the outside, but still juicy. No need to even touch the sauce. The sea bass was very good, thick cut by still tender and moist. \n\nThe ingredients were fresh, flavors well paired and quality meal for the price.

Blue Cheese salad dressing that was yellow from sitting out. Totally overcooked mini burgers.\n\nThis was a first trip so I'll keep the review to highlights. Ask for Diane, she was great. Refills arrived super promptly of everything, and free refills included the fruit lemonades. The salad bar was great, although the dressings had been sitting out for a while hence the yellow top layer on the blue cheese. Burgers come with unlimited french fries, too.",

There were three women in the store, two sitting at a table in front who quickly stood and took us to a table and distributed menus. The third was in the open kitchen toward the back with a very large ladle stirring something is a mega-gallon pot on the stove. \n\nThe room is decorated a la Mexicana, with bright paint everywhere. Otherwise, the tables/chairs were utilitarian.  The two page menu offered lunch and dinner, with a little space for desert. I appreciated that there were sopas and tortas along with the standard burritos and tacos. \n\nThe refrigeration unit was full of Mexican sodas and homemade huaracha.  We stuck with water and lime, and ordered torta al pastor and tacos pescados. Somewhat surprising that there were no chips and salsa offered gratis for the table, but required a $4 charge. Never saw that in the many other shops I have dined in around the USA, nor even in the homeland. I guess that works for them.\n\nAnyway, the meals were quite good. The tacos were full of lightly fried tilapia, onion, cilantro slung in hot tortillas.  Three were more than enough with sharing, especially with the accompanying rice and beans. The torta was even more engorged with pit fired strips of pork, tomato, cilantro and their own spicy mayonnaise, on a fresh large soft roll.  Delicioso! \n\nEl Limon does a nice balancing act between authentic Mexican fast food and the American palate. They understand their customers are from both worlds. \n\nIf they found a way to provide the chips and salsa in the traditional way, rather than to enhance their bottom line, this local chain would make my short list of favorite casas Mexicanas.",

Just look at the hands of the older men who have been hand rolling cigars their whole lives. Those hands tell a story, and it's fascinating in a lovely way. \n\nYou can find some great gifts for the cigar lover in your life here. Whether you want just an inexpensive cigar to smoke after a night at the bar tonight or if you wanna drop a couple hundo on a swanky gift for a groom-to-be, a new dad, or whatever occasion it is (\"Congrats on making it through a Wednesday!\"), you can find something for every appreciator of cigars here!

Now a hundred more sushi spots have opened in Tampa, and Joto's now offers Thai food as well as sushi, but whenever I go, it's still just for the sushi.\n\nI have tried a wide variety of sushi and sashimi here, and my favorite item is the sashimi dinner platter.  A large, varied selection of incredibly fresh seafood.  I don't necessarily eat rolls enough to have a favorite roll here, but the dragon roll which came on the Love Boat (sushi and sashimi dinner for two) was really good.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean, if dark, and service is very friendly.  A good, solid option if you are in the mood for no-frills sushi.",

  "text": "OVER.RATED. Wicked long wait for expensive, mediocre food. Only good thing was the bartender! \n\nI might ruffle some feathers on this one, but I was seriously disappointed by this place. It came highly recommended by 2 people who live locally, so a friend and I decided to try. We got there about 6 on a Wednesday night and the place was packed. The hostess was rude telling us the wait was 45 minutes and then expecting us to leave. I'm willing to wait for good food so I was already turned off by her attitude.\n\nWe waited in the waiting area (why aren't these turned into regular tables/booths to get more people serviced?!). We ended up snagging a couple of seats at the bar. The bartender was very helpful with the menu because my friend had a hard time finding something that wasn't fried. She ended up ordering some blackened fish and I got the $9 shrimp po-boy. Her food came out great but mine was another story. \n\nThe sandwich was about 8 inches long with lots of shrimp, two thin slices of tomato, like 1/4 cup of chopped lettuce and maybe 1tbsp of mayo. I shrugged the lack of extras on the sandwich and decided to bite in. The bread was so hard I couldn't bite it! I ended up having to ask for bread that wasn't toasted. When that came, I could see why they toasted it so much: it was so tough, the bread was like jerky! I ended up just eating the shrimp with only some of the bread. And for $9 without even fries? (Those are $2 extra.)\n\nWe both got beers too. They came in these goblets that were maybe about a pint size of liquid. The beer was $8! Seriously? Once we got our checks we left to go someone else for drinks. \n\nBottom line: stay away if you're looking for good food.",

  "text": "We came in with friends on the opening weekend and had a great time.  All the cocktails, appetizers, pasta dishes, and desserts we ordered were delicious.  We did not have the pizza or meat/fish dishes.\n\nAPPS -- Really liked the Oysters Randolfi  -- 3 baked oysters dressed up with fennel, breadcrumbs, and more. ($9)  The fennel really stood out and made this unique,  The house salad ($7) was different looking, using iceberg lettuce as little cups or something.  The Italian dressing really made it shine.  Next was the burrata -- soft mozzarella cheese over cucumber and herbed oil.  This was a nice portion size and perfect for spreading on the complimentary bread. Just remember to mix it all together before you dive in.\n\nPASTAS -- Definitely get the Meatball ($11).  This dish was delicious, well-portioned, and had a spicy kick.  It was served with some house-made noodles.  Not your typical spaghetti, these were thicker, chewier noodles and I really enjoyed them.  They reminded me of the noodles from Corner 17 next door.  I also tried some of the duck confit gnocchi and the salami pasta.  Both of them had great distinctive flavors.  The portion sizes of these two was on the small side, so keep that in mind if you have a large appetite.\n\nDESSERTS -- It is rare for me to order dessert, but the choices were just too appealing to skip.  I tried two. One of them used strawberries, basil, and house-made ricotta.  Every bite (there weren't many) was heaven.  Also really enjoyed another one involving a chocolate torte, cherries, and house-made mascarpone. \n\nCOCKTAILS -- If you're a cocktail nerd, you'll love the offerings here.  Each choice has a complexity-rating of 1-10 shown on the menu.  I thought that was a nice touch.  I got the #37 ($11), a bourbon-ginger liqueur concoction with cherry and smoke-infusion over ice.  It was a nice-sized drink, very well-balanced and actually seemed to pair well with the food.   And at the end, there's a nice little bonus of 2 alcohol-infused cherries to nibble on.  I tried 2 other cocktails and both were outstanding.\n\nOur server was nice and friendly and had a good knowledge of the menu. The place had a cool atmosphere and the use of music was done just right.  Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying out other stuff.",

Fortunately, we were seated in a booth which made the noise level more bearable.  Although we came at 5:30 PM, there was no mention of a happy hour by any of the staff, which was a shame.\n\nAnyway, she was really intrigued by everything she had read about the vaulted CHEESESTEAK. Had I known that, we probably wouldn't have chosen this place :-)  But they had one on the menu, just as a cheesesteak hoagie. Then she asked, \"What's a hoagie?\"  Oh jeez. Well, she loved it!  We lied and told her because there was lettuce on top of her meat that it was a healthy choice - hahaha. She ate every bit on her plate, including the giant mound of french fries (aka \"chips\"). She couldn't believe the size of the plate or the amount of food included.\n\nI opted for the plate of nachos - very tasty, and hit the spot. \n\nService was pretty good, although we had to chase down our server for more drinks as we finished ours off pretty quickly.\n\nI'd like to try to come back for burgers.",

  "text": "I have been here many times and had good experiences.  However, my last three interactions were terrible, to the point I vowed never to return.  I've giving two stars only because they have a good selection of items and carry a lot of locally produced goods.\n\nI tried grocery delivery. My food was clearly sitting for a while or in an unrefrigerated van.  My frozen goods were soft and my meat was close to room temperature.  I had checked the box to allow substitutions.  However, the substitutions were just weird. They kept the brands and substituted the flavors.  So pepperocini Kettle Chips were replaced with chile verde Kettle Chips.  Tyson buffalo wings were replaced with Tyson BBQ wings. I called to complain and to their credit, the woman I spoke with gave me a $40 credit on my order. \n\nI tried curbside pickup.  I ordered two kinds of fish, frozen shrimp, and crab sticks.  I ordered the day before for 7 p.m. pickup.  I received a message in early afternoon that they shopped my items.  However, when I arrived, they said they were out of the fish I ordered.  When I asked why this wasn't conveyed sooner, they had no response, and seemed vaguely amused that I was frustrated. \n\nFinally, I tried going inside.  It was a Saturday morning, but not too many cars outside.  In theory, their procedures are safe.  But in practice, one employee outside near the entrance wasn't wearing a mask.  Another inside by the registers had his mask pulled down below his nose. They had helpful one-way signage, but no one was enforcing it and shoppers were going where ever they wanted. The checkout lines took longer than they have any previous time I have been there.  Finally, the self checkout lines will not allow you to scan your items until you enter your rewards number.  I couldn't get mine to work, so I couldn't ring up my groceries without assistance.  I was completely frazzled by the time I left. \n\nIt is a shame, they have a great produce selection, as well as cheese and seafood.  But it is not worth the headache.  They used to be so customer centered, but I didn't see much evidence of it lately.",

Apparently JFK honeymooned here and it's known to be quite secluded and beautiful. How can I read that and not check it out right??? \n\nWe had a late lunch so we just went to the Plow and Angel for drinks so we can check out the grounds/bar. Plow and Angel itself is very quaint and lovely. The bartendar gave me a few different wines to try and I ended up going with one of their Chardonnay's which I'm not generally fond of drinking. It was pretty good though and strong!!! I was  pretty buzzed before my dessert came out. LOL! Add some sips of beer and tada! Buzzed CJ. haha\n\nValrhona Chocolate cheesecake is delish!!! Very rich yet subtle if that makes any sense. Orange accents, tangerine sorbet on top, and a little raspberry sauce. MmMmm!!!! \n\nThe one thing I did notice before I left was that they had dessert wines on the dessert menu. I had initially asked for a sweeter wine, preferably a Moscato/Muscat wine but the bartender said they didn't have any. While checking out the dessert menu, they did have Muscat wine!!!! :( I was so sad. \n\nEveryone was very nice and it was a nice experience. I wish I didn't overhear some racist remarks some patrons said to our bartender but I won't go into that here. Other than the last two points, it was FABULOUS! :)",

  "text": "Time for a city tour of NOLA from the comfort of an air conditioned van.  It was freakin' hot, so I had no issues just riding along.  Some people might prefer more time at some of these sights.  In that case, take a different tour.\n\nThis was a nice way to see different parts of the city.  My favorite portions of the tour were the Lower Ninth Ward and the Garden District.  On one hand you had the people most impacted by Katrina and on the other hand you had celebrity homes and grand mansions.  The sad part about the Lower Ninth Ward was seeing people sitting on their front porches just watching these tour buses drive by.  I'd be curious to know if these tour companies do anything for the neighborhoods they are profiting off of.\n\nThe least favorite portion of the tour was probably the French Quarter.  I felt the \"sights\" mentioned were basically the advertisers with the tour company.  For example, it was suggested we eat at Huck Finn's at least three different times during the tour.  They even dropped us off there at the end to catch our afternoon swamp tour.\n\nPlease note that you are in the van the entire time except for one stop at a cemetery and a stop at the New Orleans visitors center.  Overall it was informative and introduced me to some new things to check out when I return on a future visit (we were leaving the next day).\n\nWe booked two tours (city and swamp) to get a discount.  For my review of the swamp tour, you can search for Cajun Encounters Swamp Tours, LLC in zip code 70461.",

To me, a bowl of ramen is judged by its broth and meat, and both bowls hit home runs in that department. The miso bowl was very rich and flavorful, while the brisket bowl was more spicy with a kick of kimchi. The brisket bowl came with a matzah ball, which I found strange... I didn't care much for it, but it did soak up the broth fairly well. The eggs they put in both bowls were really soft.. like not just runny yolk, but runny erythang.. Only the miso bowl came with the egg; the brisket bowl required an add on ($2 for an egg smh..)\n\nAll in all, would definitely come back for ramen fix.",

I'm FAR from the \"boujee\" my waiter needs to tend to my every need type patron...I like little to no attention so I can chit chat with my girlfriends and spend the majority of my time stuffing my face.\n\nWe ordered some appetizers, ate said appetizers, and literally had to FLAG down our waiters to order more food. (Waiters in plural because we literally had two but got zero attention). It was like they brought us the food and forgot we existed. We may as well should've been invisible.  This was just the start of my frustration...we placed the order and the majority of the food came out, except for mine and my friend's. My friend's food then came out. Mine didn't. We reminded them about the sweet and sour chicken that we had ordered. Fast forward to 8:30 pm...mind you we sat at 6:30 pm, the sweet and sour chicken comes out. By this time we didn't friggin want it, so my friend says we aren't paying for that chicken. The bill comes, the chicken is on the bill. After much argument, they removed it from the bill and made a point to take the chicken away rather than letting us box it up to take home for the huge inconvenience they caused us. It was actually the most annoying and disrespectful action I've ever experienced from a waiter at dinner. \n\nIf I wrote this review after my first visit, they probably would've gotten a 4 or 5 stars, now however I'm disgusted with this place and will NOT be back. There are dozens of other dim sum spots in Philly...take my advice and go there.",

In typical Steven Starr fashion, the restaurant is dressed to impress, the food is pretty good, and the margaritas are outstanding.\n\nBut the service just doesn't cut it, especially given the prices on the menu. I've been here twice now, and both times the servers didn't seem too interested in my table. I shouldn't feel the need to obnoxiously flag someone down for another drink or for a napkin.\n\nAt my last visit, we waited forever for the bill. One person wanted a separate check. The server asked if anyone else wanted a separate check, waited all of ten seconds for an answer and then huffed off only to return fifteen minutes later with the bill. \n\nLet's put this in perspective. I'm paying $13 for guacamole. $13. You can get the same exact amount and quality for less at so many other places, but because it gets served up in a giant stone bowl and because it's El Vez, you get upcharged and everyone worships it. I love me some guac, but I've seriously gotten a tub of made-at-Whole Foods guac for $6, and it's just as good. I mean really, it doesn't exactly require chef-level skill to make and to make well.\n\nSo, $13 guac. No happy hour specials. Food that is, in typical Steven Starr fashion, pricey because hey you pay for the ambience. All that for uninterested and barely competent service. \n\nEh.",

(Be sure to make a reservation to be on the safer side!)\n\nThe lemon poppy pancakes were the BEST that I've ever had. It was not too sweet but I still didn't have to add any syrup! The lemon flavor was very strong -- definitely satisfied my lemon pancake cravings. The short stack is $8 and the full stack is $11. I was full off getting the short stack with a side of bacon.\n\nTheir savory options here are great too. Pretty hefty dishes with a lot of flavor. \n\nDrinks here are decent. The iced drinks are served in a cute little mason jar that's garnished with some sugar on the rim. Super aesthetic! \n\nService was kind, friendly and fairly quick. I'm excited to come back next time!",

By recommendation of my server, I had a watermelon cocktail and the crawfish fajitas.

If possible grab a table water side the breeze off the water really stifles the Florida humidity and provides a great unobstructed view.\n\nStaff - very friendly and professional and plentiful even with the limited capacity rules in place everyone seemed to work together. The kitchen seemed to get the food out in a reasonable time and our server was on top of things so no complaints here.\n\nJack's Chicken Sandwich - We had the southern fried version and it was delicious a real quality chicken sandwich fresh ingredients and well constructed - I'd do this one again and again and again.\n\nHouse Grouper Sandwich - We chose the blackened version - such a modest name, make no mistake this is deliciousness on a bun.

  "text": "Have you ever been trying to kill a spider and end up trying to light it on fire and soon your entire bedroom is engulfed in flames and all that can cross your mind is \"This was a mistake\"?  That's how I feel about this place.\n\nMother's came highly recommended, based off the fact that it was apparently featured on a Travel Channel food show of some sort.  And let me just say...why?\n\nRant begin:\n\nSo I don't mind the line.  The line is not an issue.  Some people may think that a line guarantees quality, but having lived around the LA food scene I can very much guarantee you it does not.  But as lines go, this wasn't a long wait, even if it looks like one.\n\nI don't mind that service was a little weird.  Now no one working here seemed like bad people, but it's a definite culture shock coming from California where service is apparently super friendly and then in NOLA it's just sort of \"I'll help you, but I don't have to like it\".  Nothing for me to get angry at, just a bit of a shift.  But that's still not the problem.\n\nThe problem was the Ferdi Special.  I'm going to be here possibly once in my life, I'm going to go for the Ferdi Special because it's at the top of the menu and it is a specialty of Mother's.  Therefore, this is them saying \"This is our best effort, enjoy\".  And...\n\nWho in their right mind looked at \"Au Jus\" and seriously thought \"Hey, you know that runny, wet sauce people like to dip roast beef sandwiches into?  Hear me out, let's puddle it onto the bottom of the plate and let the sandwich just sit in it.  Just let it swim in those juices.  Just let that bread soak it all in and disintegrate before your very eyes.  Because that's what sandwiches were made for.  They were made so you can't pick them up.\"  Like I'm all for open faced but sandwiches are literally made to be eaten with hands what is this?!  It's a mess.  It's a mess of salty meat.  Was it good?  No.  Not even close.  I came in wanting a nice hot meal and I get half of a sandwich and it's not very good.  And just so I'm clear, this wasn't a bit of soggy bread.  This bread was full on paste by the time it got to me.  You CAN'T pick it up, it just crumbles into goop.\n\nAnd part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and say \"Well maybe they have good gumbo or something\" but this was the specialty at the top of the menu!  If I went to an actual mother's house and said \"Cook me your specialty\" and they're all \"Okay, let me make you some delicious meatloaf\" and the meatloaf comes out and it's made of paper towels and used syringes you don't get a chance to offer me some soup.  You had your shot and squandered it.\n\nI give them two stars because there is still care and hope for this business and obviously someone must like it, and the food wasn't inedible I suppose.  But the Ferdi Special is not the way to go.  Some other reviews might disagree, but they lie.  That's right, I'm calling you out.  You know you're valid opinion?  It's wrong.  You have a wrong opinion.  and your favorite movie isn't very good either.  I'm feeling salty.  It's probably from all the salty meat.",

I met up with a few folks last week at an outside table, it's my very first time going to an establishment to dine \"in\" since covid started.  Not really into it yet but this place makes it quite comfortable.\n\nOur seating was outside and the service was great!  They handed us one-time use paper menus and they wore masks.\n\nI asked about the stone crabs, although they are always pricey, their prices were a good bit higher than what I'm used to paying in another area in Tampa Bay... so I opted for the Blue Crab stuffed Avocado.  With their kettle chips instead of crackers.  I am not a big chip fan but was told they were awesome.  They were ok, tasted like chips to me.  I'm still not a big chip fan, so next time I'd get the crackers.\nThe blue crab was pretty good but not ahh-mazing...\n\nThere were 5 in our party, they split the bill individually and although a couple of errors, they took the incorrect ones back without issue, fixed them and had them back to us in a jiffy.\n\nI would come back, sit outside and enjoy this place again.",

  "text": "Mediocre food at best and inattentive service. I love Indian food and when done well it always hits the spot. Unfortunately, the dinner here was forgettable and underwhelming. Since I was hungry, I hurriedly selected 3 entrees and all 3 turned out to be disappointing. All 3 dishes were served at the same time in less than 5 minutes which started me thinking that they may all be pre-cooked and just heated up to serve.\n\nThe first entree was MASALA DOSA which is a South Indian style crepe made from rice and lentils and stuffed with potatoes and onions. The potatoes were almost rancid which suggested to me that the stuffings were definitely not fresh and prepared awhile ago. So even though the crepe tasted crunchy, the potatoes spoilt the whole dish!\n\nThe second entree I guess was an Indian classic MURG (CHICKEN) CURRY which I always use as a barometer to test how good their curry was. The flavor was just ok with chunks of dark meat chicken and nothing else. It was too garlicky for me and certainly failed to impress.\nThe third entree was a rice plate MURG BIRYANI which was made with Basmati rice with chunks of dark meat chicken, onions, nuts and raisins. The rice tasted like leftover rice and was bland with no kick that one can expect from Indian food. \n\nService was sorely lacking. The Indian lady (owner?) was a lady with few words who quickly took my orders and was never to be seen or heard again. Water was never refilled and no one bothered to check on the dinners. I did notice as one yelper previously commented that the help did act like indentured slaves which I thought was quite amusing.\n\nI may give this restaurant another chance but probably not any time soon.",

  "text": "I LOVE Drago's! I first went there for diner last year during my visit for Mardi Gras season last year. I was so sick that year, but the food was still so good. I couldn't wait to go back this year when my tastebuds were working right. And I was not disappointed. \nI ordered the same dish I did last time. I could tell by the texture a year ago the food was really good and could actually slightly taste the corn dish. It pained me to not be able to fully taste such good food. The dish was Drago's Mixed Grill: Half of a Maine lobster, a petit filet, and blackened shrimp with a light Cajun cream sauce, served with corn maque choux and potatoes (from the menu). \nMy waiter was Dipen, and he was wonderful. He was so polite and attentive. Made sure I had everything I needed. The service was perfect.\nThe filet was cooked to a perfect medium-rare, just as I'd requested. The lobster was delicious and delicate. Loved the potatoes and corn--the corn had a bit of a spicy kick to it. It was just a beautiful meal that was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The steak was like butter. I knew I'd missed out due to my illness the year before but didn't realize how much! It was one of the most delectable dinners I had in NOLA. Like I always say, it's hard to get a bad meal in New Orleans.\nThe dining room is comfortable and had a nice atmosphere. For once, I wasn't asked to sit at the bar because I was dining alone, and I REALLY appreciated that. I had my own little cushy booth. I didn't think the price was bad either. It was pretty much what I'd expect to pay for lobster and steak. \nThis restaurant is in a hotel but Drago's is away from the lobby enough to seem like a separate entity. If you want an upscale dinner that tastes amazing, maybe want to treat yourself a bit, make sure you eat here. I certainly will be returning next year when I visit for Mardi Gras 2021. \nI want to try the chargrilled oysters next time. I hate to admit I've never eaten oysters and don't think I could do the raw ones, but I need to step off the ledge next year and try the chargrilled ones.",

  "text": "Bomb Malaysian restaurant in Chinatown.\n\nAt an event last nite and needed something to eat afterwards. Got on Yelp and found this gem a few blocks up. Ordered takeout, they were fast, super friendly and we got some people-watching in while we waited. \n\nI love Singaporean & Malaysian food and we had it often in California, in fact one of our favorite places was called Banana Leaf, so I was interested in seeing how this place stacked up.\n\nBetter than the original. And that's saying a lot. \n\nIndian MeeGoreng had so much flavor, I'm not a big noodle eater, but I finished these the next day for lunch rather than giving it up to my hub for leftovers.\n\nRoti Canai was probably best eaten fresh vs sitting in a bag for a 20min ride home, but it was still pretty good, chewy and crisp at the same time. The sauce was a little thin and could use a bit more kick. \n\nHub's Thai Basil chicken, WOW. I mean you hear 'Thai Basil Chicken' and you think, just another filler item on a way-too-long menu, but wow, the flavor off this dish was amazing. The coconut rice was honestly some of the best I've ever had, soft, flakey and packed with flavor. I snuck some of this dish onto my plate and the dog won't be getting leftovers.\n\nChicken Satay, again another one of those menu items we've all had and they are all vastly forgettable. Not this one. REALLY flavorful...the meat doesn't even need the thick-as-paste peanut sauce (but it's still fun to slather it on), and plentiful sized appetizer. \n\nGot a Malaysian iced tea to go, packed well, and it was a bit more evaporated milky tasting than I'm used to so wasn't quite a fan there but maybe it's an acquired taste.\n\nLove love loved this place. It seriously kicked N. California's ass on flavor. Surprise.",

The hostess was extremely nice and friendly as well as the other workers that were about. There were two TV screens playing, one was showing a soccer game (the louder of the 2 TVs) and the other side was The Matrix. The seating are small tables of about 4 but can be pushed together for bigger parties, I assume. \n\nWe were offered openers for wine and beer and also served water. The water had to be the biggest complaint since there were particles floating at the top. We later informed them of this but our waters were never replaced, maybe because we were at the end of our meal. The buffet was decent. Really great cheesy lasagna and I loved the beans and their rice. There is also a salad bar. The meat that were out were kinda dry, I would suggest going up for the ones on skewers. If you are going for the meat skewers, I recommend the chicken hearts! They are my favorite. The meats were also nice and juicy, including the chicken. I didn't think they were overseasoned, either. \n\nI'm not sure how this method of going up to the server to get the meat vs them going to your table works when it is very busy, but it is definitely less stressful than having lots of servers with skewers running to your table when your card is flipped to green. We took some desserts to go, including my favorites tiramisu and tres leches. Both were very good. We will definitely be visiting again. It is very affordable and the service is nice.",

That's $2 more than the price of a single ticket back home and you don't need to take out a 2nd mortgage to get popcorn. Definitely check out Keller Plaza if there's something you missed that should be seen on the big screen.",

  "text": "We stopped in here on a Monday evening.  In know I'm in the minority, but I liked the Korean food here when it was Sushi Boat - it wasn't fancy, but it was authentic, and similar to stuff I had growing up; think more like at home cooking than restaurant food.\n\nChanges seem pretty limited - looks like they're not using the old sushi counter, which had one of those conveyor belt boat systems, though it's still just sitting there on one side of the restaurant, taking up probably 20 to 25% of the floor space of the front of the house.  Sushi Boat had a small bar on the left when you came in, though it looked like it was more storage than a bar.  Rolls and Spicy have renovated this area slightly, and turned it into the sushi bar, with a half-dozen bar stools or so.  The rest of the space is the same as before, with maybe ten booths, and a few free standing tables.  \n\nI ordered the seafood soft tofu stew (soondubu chigae), which is one of my favorite Korean dishes, and an order of hamachi since I wanted to try out the sushi.  The GF ordered some rolls.  The a la carte prices seemed dirt cheap for the sushi - nigiri was $2 or $3 for two pieces, and rolls started at $3 for things like a California roll or spicy crab, on up to around $8 for a caterpillar roll.\n\nThey had one waitress working the front of the house, and we saw a guy running around, helping out a bit here and there.  We started wondering if they were the only staff working, but we eventually did notice someone wandering around in the back - not sure if they may have had more staff hidden in the kitchen, but I doubt it.  The tables that were cluttered when we came in remained cluttered, as they didn't have the time (or perhaps the organization) to bus the tables.\n\nMy tofu stew came out, and I waited for a bit, thinking the sushi would be coming soon.  After a few minutes, the GF told me to go ahead and eat before my food went cold.  During the wait, I had been looking at my food (which came out in a standard little stone bowl), wondering if they had heard that I'd ordered the seafood version of the soondubu chigae, as I was only seeing a few scraps in it - at most Korean restaurants, you'll have some clams, a shrimp or two, and other random seafood, that you might have to pick through a bit - think like a cioppino.  While I found a few pieces of clam meat, it seemed to have come from one of those bags of mixed frozen seafood, and there might have been one, maybe two, tablespoons worth of seafood in the whole thing.  Then I tasted  the broth, which had a promising bright red color to it.  I was surprised that it had almost no flavor whatsoever, and almost no kick what-so-ever.  Bizarre.  Overall, the chigae basically seemed like it had been thrown together in five minutes, with no simmering, no making a good stock/broth ahead of time, etc.\n\nEven more surprising was that while I was eating, the sushi was nowhere to be seen - another group or two came in (in addition to those that had come in previously), and it became obvious that tables were becoming restless - we overhead comments from other tables such as \"I think they're having to kill the pig . . . \" and muttered complaints as one table that came in later got banchan (Korean \"appetizers\") before the other table had even ordered.  I heard/saw the waitress comp the Sapporo the table that came in right after us ordered as they were having to wait so long (they didn't have any food, and they'd probably been waiting 20 or 30 minutes).  That seemed like a good gesture, except they didn't comp any other tables as far as I could tell.  As I'm finishing, the waitress comes over and says \"Sorry - we've started your sushi now\", with an awkward smile on her face and no explanation for the disjointed service.  At this point, it was obvious she had no experience as a waitress, and her limited English skills were such that we didn't press for an explanation.  The fact that the guy we had seen helping out front earlier left the kitchen and was now working behind the sushi bar seems to suggest he may have been trying to run the back of the house all alone.\n\nWe ended up getting the rolls and the nigiri to go, and basically got what we paid for - sushi was like what you might get at a grocery store.  GF mentioned that if she didn't have to wait, it could be okay togo, as it's so cheap.\n\nI still want to give this place another shot, as I've heard decent things from people who've gone when no one else is there; not that that's a glowing endorsement, but I definitely crave Korean food occasionally.\n\nAs an aside, I have no idea who did their web page, but obviously not someone who's culturally sensitive.  The link to the Japanese menu at http://rollsandspicy.com/reno-nv-japanese-food-and-sushi.htm, reads \"Click here to view our Rolls & Spicy Jap Menu\".  In additional to the racial slur, the link is broken.\n\nOverall, inexperienced restaurant owners/staff, uber-slow service, mediocre food, but cheap, serviceable sushi",

  "text": "This place is still one of my favorites! \n\nMy friends and I came here for dinner a few sundays ago.\n\nWe started out by ordering a plate of dirty fries -- possibly some of the most addictive things on earth!  The last time I had them prior to this visit,  I took them with me on the plane and I made the flight attendant drool with the smell. We were all very hungry and DEVOURED them. I almost stabbed our poor waitress in the hand trying to get the last morsel of dirty fries!\n\nI ordered their version of sheperd's pie. It was a strange combination but definitely grew on me over the meal. My boyfriend got a burger and loved it. Fellow yelper Armita R just got the junior burger but she said it was perfect! It's really impressive when a place can make something super simple really good. \n\nWhat I think is wonderful and amazing is the IDK option on the menu. I'm that annoying person that sends the waiter away 3x before the table can order because I can NEVER decide what I want to eat! Amrita R's bf got the IDK and it was fabulous! They were testing out a new menu item and I loved it! \n\nI can't wait to come back (but I need to exercise some more first)",

However, the event itself was fairly fun. It was a nice Christmasy event, lots of lights to look at, hot cocoa, fake snow (poorly done fake snow may I add) but it did have its highlights. \n\nEveryone we ran into that worked here was very pleasant and friendly. They have stepped up the beer selection and even offered seasonal choices. All the food we tried was horrid!! The lights were great! Some much better then others, like the blue zone with the lights seemingly dropping from the trees and the colony house interactive lights/music was neat to watch (and made us giggle when we walked out of the colony house to dozens of people staring at us...oh no...it was the lights..but for a brief moment...the fame!)\n\nThey \"real\" statue girl was fun to watch as she surprised the ones who didnt know she was real until she moved during their picture op.\n\nThe skating rink and the snow zone were fun, although crowded and very limited on how much time you can spend (3 mins and they herd you out and bring in the nex group) And oh, no throwing snow balls at each other or they toss you out. (WHat! I had a good target on the hubby)\n\nAll in all it was a nice Christmas thing to do, really put us in the holiday spirit and made us feel like we were up north in a small town but definitely not worth the priceif you pay full price that is.",

  "text": "When my husband or kids get to pick what kind of take-out to get, they often pick Panda Express. It seems like they have something to please everyone. While this is a typical food-court style Asian restaurant in a stand-alone building, they make everything in small batches so it all is hot and fresh when ordered. They have your typical American style Chinese offerings, and monthly have a new \"special\" entree.\n\nMy favorite thing about Panda Express is their website. Before going to the restaurant you can go online and create your meal and see all of the nutritional information for what you want to order. I love the Panda Bowls, which include rice and one entree. However, you can also get half rice (white or fried rice), half steamed veggies, and one entree. If you choose this option, there are many Panda Bowls that you can create for under 400 calories and it is plenty of food for a filling dinner.\n\nFiguring out exactly what we want to order online and then going through the drive-thru is a great time-saver for our busy family.",

  "text": "Stopped in after driving 7 hours from Atlanta. We were super hungry but not in the mood for fancy schmancy food. I yelped up Tampa Bay Brewing Company because my hubby wanted a Turkey Burger. Located in Ybor City, we were surprised at how empty the place was but we weren't deterred. I ordered an appetizer Shrimp (can't remember the name) but they were fried and then tossed in a spicy and sweet red chili sauce. I wasnt expecting the appetizer portion to be so large but not only was the portion large...so we're the shrimp. Not colossal but pretty big as I was expecting popcorn shrimp for $9.99. I also ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes and a small side salad. Let me just say that although the shrimps flavor wasn't what I would consider fantastic, they were pretty good, the garlic mashed potatoes were served in a small bowl and kinda reminded me of mashed potatoes from elementary school...really dry looking and tasting. I ate a small amount of the potatoes as I wasnt too crazy about them. My salad was nice. They used really fresh and nice mixed greens instead of iceberg lettuce and the blue cheese dressing tasted kind of home made. My husbands turkey burger looked like one of those white frozen patties style turkey burgers instead of a homemade turkey burger but there were a lot of options to add like blue cheese or bacon etc. he opted to add Smoked Gouda and mushrooms and he seemed to enjoy it in spite of it being a frozen patty. I also ordered their Blond Beer which was mild and light tasting beer. I was told by. The waiter that Tampa Bay Brewing Company is not a chain and so I give them credit for that. The food was okay but at least it was fresh and served quickly. Staff was polite too!",

Are used to come here just for the sushi but I honestly had no idea what was in some of the rolls. There were no labels on the sushi buffet so I grabbed what I thought was a spicy tuna roll. I am honestly not quite sure what it was but it tasted sour and tart. The other role I grabbed I thought had salmon on top and when I bit into it I have no idea what it was either. I'm not expecting anything grand but I at least want to identify it because I eat sushi all the time and I like to know what is what.

  "text": "3.5\n\nI really hope these guys make it. There's so much heart and (this is most important) I think it's vital that people understand that this isn't a typical Mexican joint that has Americanized its flavors for a palate that is, largely. unfamiliar with the differences in Mexican cuisine (there are 31 states in Mexico; each has its own take on regional cuisine).* So while YMMV, I think it's important to know what El Folklor is and is not before you sit down to try its food.\n\nI came in for take out on a chilly Saturday evening. The dining room was decently busy. I was greeted as soon as I came in (always a nice touch; it doesn't happen all of the time). I told the servers that I wanted a plate to go. They offered me a table, a menu and some water. My first impression: the servers were very nice and hustling very hard to put smiles on everyone's face. After spending a little time going over things, I made my choice: Combo #2. I ordered and my server was quick to point out that the plate came with dishes from three regions and if that was okay. 'Yes' and 'yes.' This may be where some people make a mistake. This isn't (solely) Mexican food. EF takes an approach to Central American cuisine as well (which is different in style and taste profile from most Americanized Mexican food). I ordered and watched the Mexican version of The Jersey Shore (seriously) as I waited for my food. My server came by to apologize for my wait but I told him I'd rather wait for fresh food than have a plate ready as soon as I ordered. Plus, my wait time wasn't too long. Food ready, I hit the road.\n\nI came home to discover a generous amount of food, especially for the price. My #2 Combo came with a Mexican-style chimichanga, a Guatemalan doblada (turnover similar to a pupusa; served with cabbage) and a Salvadoran-style tamale (made from maiz and wrapped in plantain leaves rather than corn husks) -- all chicken. I began with the chimichanga, as it was most familiar to me. It was enjoyable. But, when is fried food bad? I also liked the cheese sauce that came with it. I was impressed with the portion size. Next was the doblada. This was my first time having one, although I've had many pupusas. I really enjoyed it. Again, the portion size was generous and I was happy with the consistency and cooking style of the chicken. Granted, it wasn't the most seasoned of dishes but never having had one before, I don't know if that's typical or not. I saved the tamale for last both because it was fairly large (came in its own container) and I'm not the world's biggest tamale fan. The good news is that I enjoyed the tamale more than I do its Mexican counterpart. The bad news is that I am still not a huge fan of tamales (although I appreciated the flavor profile of the dish).\n\nEl Folklor provides the kind of culinary experience one would, typically, have to travel to Nolensville Pike for. I can appreciate the risk the owners took in bringing it to Inglewood. I hope that people take the time to consider and appreciate the differences it offers before complaining that it doesn't serve 'tacos with tomatoes and sour cream.'\n\n*The menu has changed since I first came here in late winter. While I understand from a business point of view the need to change what they offer to meet the expectations of the consumer base, I think it's sad.",

The line moved quickly enough and with the laughter and conversations going on, the hour that passed only felt like minutes. We were seated in a cool, (Thank God ) rather large restaurant and greeted warmly by our waiter.\n\nThe table ordered BBQ shrimp, two orders of soft shell crab (amazing) seafood gumbo, stuffed flounder and a shrimp platter.  The BBQ shrimp were delicious but thank God I worked out that morning.  It arrived swimming in BBQ butter and I disliked pulling off the heads and tails.. it was such a tasty but messy meal... so much that the shrimp were slipping out of my fingers from the butter bath... the girls loved their food and the portions were enormous ( I see why obesity is so high .. portions could feed at least 3 people ).. but I digress, and the atmosphere was great for the enormous crowds. I polished off my gumbo and headed to bathroom to remove the now caked butter off my hands.\n\nThe bathroom was FILTHY and let me reiterate FILTHY.... I watched poor women reach under stalls for TP and the women's receptacle was overflowing... TP littered the floor and I knew this bathroom hadn't been checked in hours.. I went up front and asked that the restroom be cleaned and was brushed off... I took pictures of the trash and this time asked for a manager... as he swiped through my phone he promptly had an employee (the same one who brushed me off **laughs inside ** ) carry armfuls of TP into the restroom and get to work cleaning..\n\nAll in all, outside of dirty bathrooms, the food was banging and my compliments go to the Chef ... 1 Star demotion for the bathroom.. recommended for you Yelpers !\n\nIslandgal29412 ~ Ms. Foodie",

  "text": "We went to this weird Santa Barbara Night Market place during a brief weekend trip between the holidays last month. Matt B. and I were walking along State Street with friends around 3:45 or so and got curious enough about this spot to swing by when it opened at 4:00. It was a pop-up bazaar or something like it in a defunct Macy's, behind a flashy UGG shop that may also have been a pop-up.\n\nIt was strange and kind of cool walking through a place that was so clearly a dead Macy's. The space managed to feel a bit deserted even filled up with local vendors. There were some neat booths set up displaying jewelry and clothes and crafty miscellany. A few food and beverage vendors, though nothing particularly tempting. It was interesting to walk through, but there was something a little half-assed about the whole thing.\n\nI assume Santa Barbara Night Market was open at night, but it was definitely a day market when we went, and calling it a night market just struck me as funny and ultra white, given the usual night market connotations (food! crowds! Asians!). Anyway, I guess it's closed now, and whoever owns the building will have to figure out another use for an abandoned Macy's.",

You definitely can't go wrong with any of the milk teas, and the bobas are chewy. Their puff waffle with filling are okay, a good snack if you're hungry but nothing to write home about. I tried the recent limited edition strawberry drinks with the strawberry boba - definitely not worth it. The strawberry bobas tasted plain, not strawberry-like, and wasn't sweet. Definitely better off with the regular boba",

But not to worry, they serve breakfast all day! \n\nThe menu is mostly Greek-inspired breakfast entrees, smoothies, and paninis. They tout natural ingredients and locally sourced items when possible. The freshness of their food was wonderful. We started off with giant Americanos which hit the spot. I had the Davis Island Breakfast which included baked bacon, bread, and eggs topped with feta, spinach, and paprika. Wonderful!

The lamb appetizer and the chorizo dates were both tender and juicy. The cochinita I had, while on the smaller side, was packed with flavor and fantastic. The meat was well-marinated and the entire ensemble played well together.\n\nThe not-so-good: The empanadas were a dud, especially for the price. They weren't filled with much and the taste just wasn't there. Otherwise, the only other thing worth noting is the price - it's a tad much, but it's also in the resort.\n\nFood: 8/10\nService: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10",

  "text": "The beach on one side. Mountains on the other. And wine country in between. It's hard to screw this one up, but Cloud Climbers Wine Country Tour really delivers an exceptional experience for any wine enthusiast. Touring vineyards in a small, open-air Jeep is how it's meant to be done. The sights and smells of the Santa Ynez valley, allure of Los Olivos tasting rooms, and rustic charm of Solvang offer a rich backdrop for a day of exploring four locally celebrated wineries. Let your tour guide choose where you go or offer your own insight - the day is yours. Most stops include between five and six tastings tailored to your taste in addition to access to the grounds. Drink in the deep greens of the valley and dazzling views of the Pacific before enjoying a picnic lunch under the California sun to round out your afternoon. The small size of the Jeep keeps your tour private (or semi-private at \"worst\") so you aren't vying for attention from your guide or begrudgingly dragged to vineyards you aren't interested in. Cloud Climbers service is friendly and accommodating and wholly lacking in any touristy gimmicks that sometimes plague these types of things. Well worth the price for such an enjoyable experience. Even though it's hard to complain after close to 20 wine tastings (ahem), I assure you it's a true \"must\" whether you're a local or a visitor.",

You may be familiar with how I feel about needlessly pimped (and priced) Mexican food (see Alma de Cuba) and all that criticism applies here. Seriously, if you charge $18 for enchiladas, where the hell do you get off charging over $20 just because you've plated them as an assortment, rather than 3-of-a-kind. Bullshit.  The food is okay, but it certainly isn't worth the price. There was time when they did reasonably priced catering, but that time is gone (and their catering manager was always uber-unhelpful anyway). \n\nI'd give it 2 stars, except that it's so damn conveniently located, has a working photo booth, and I'm head over heals in LOVE with the Mexican Chop Salad with cumin cilantro dressing.

  "text": "First off, this is actually more a 3.5 review. While I wanted to be able to give it 4, this is just one of those experiences I just can't seem to round up. \n\nMurrieta's has always been a Mexican restaurant I liked, but rarely visited. I think that's mainly because I used to go to the Sparks location with an old friend, and since he left, I don't really get out that way very much, and the South Reno store just doesn't come to the top of my mind often. For some reason, I always remembered it being kind of sleepy, but when we stopped in last week, this place was hopping. \n\nWhat I love about Murrieta's is the variety on their menu. They've got the typical enchiladas, tacos, burritos, and chile rellenos, but as most know, I appreciate those signature dishes that you just aren't going to find on anyone else's menu. Well at Murrieta's, those are the Pambasos. Hard to pronounce but easy to put down, Pambasos are small, light, and pillowy rolls, dipped in a red chile sauce, and crisped on a flat top to trap the flavor and moisture. They're cut to create a pocket, and then stuffed with your choice of meat. I usually get a chorizo, al pastor, and lengua! I love that they offer these meats on their regular menu. \n\nOn this visit, from the minute we walked in to the moment we left, the service was impeccable. Our server knew the menu front and back, was great at making suggestions, and visited at all the right points in the meal. He made sure water glasses were filled, chips remained in steady supply, and that we had everything we needed to enjoy the meal. If rating on his service alone, it would be 5 stars. \n\nAs for what we ordered, when we were seated I could hear and smell fajitas, and had my heart set on them. But as usual, I looked over the menu and made my decision more difficult by eyeing the carnitas. Fortunately Ashley and I decided to share both dishes! \n\nThe carnitas were well seasoned, moist, tender, and slightly crispy from a little bit of time on the flat top. They were some of the tastiest carnitas I've enjoyed in a while, and it's a dish I'd be happy to order again. The fajitas smelled and looked delicious when they arrived, and they were served sizzling on a seriously hot skillet. Unfortunately, something was wrong with the beef though, and it had an off flavor which sort of spread through the dish. The portions on both were ample, and we took home leftovers from both plates, and our server got us extra salsa to take with it. \n\nI had the leftovers the next day, and while opening the salsa containers I noticed the green salsa had expanded overnight and sort of popped when opened. I thought air must've gotten trapped in it and dipped my first bite in. As soon as it hit my tongue I knew it was spoiled, and I didn't eat it. Kind of weird to encounter the same thing twice here, and I'm hoping it was a total fluke.\n\nThis Murrieta's is close to home, and as our usual Mexican spot has been ok lately, I think we'll definitely give it another shot in the future. I know if that beef had been fresher, those would have been the best fajitas I've had in Reno, and just one more reason why Murrieta's is a local favorite.",

Here are my thoughts on this particular spot. \n\nPro - The restaurant is in a fun part of town. The vibe is great!\n\nCon - There's no parking lot/garage. We found a free meter (after 6p on a Friday night) about four blocks away. \n\nCon - The service wasn't great. The friends we went with said it had never been that cruddy before. But on this particular night the servers were hard to flag down and forgot things. It took forever for me to simply get a glass of water because I happened to be up using the bathroom when she took drink orders and I guess I missed my window. Also, with AYCE they need a new system in order to not cluttering the table to heck. Most places I've been, they bring out as much as they can on one huge plate. Here, we ended up with a million small plates and quickly ran out of room. Also, they were very slow to clear which only added to the problem. \n\nPro - I really did enjoy the food. I wish there were more appetizer options, but I liked the Fried Dumplings and Stuffed Mushrooms. I also appreciated the vegetarian and cooked Rolls. I felt the selection was unique and not like I'd seen before.",

I have to drive quite a ways to get over there, but I make it worth the trip by hauling the kids along with me and hitting up the Cici's close by or going roller skating at Airline Skate Center.  But alas, I digress.\n\nThis is a good place to come and stock up on staples: canned goods, dry items like canned drinks, noodles, chips, crackers, cereal and stuff, and dairy.  Their produce is pretty ok most of the time, if you don't mind a couple of bruises on your apples.  I bruise easily myself, so I don't mind.  The meat is touch-and-go; it sort of depends on the day as to the quality there, but I usually pick up some ground turkey and maybe a pack of pork chops at least.  The frozen food selection is great, and it is a fantastic place to pick up some bread.  Hell, buy two and stick one loaf in the freezer.

It can take up to 25 minutes for the oysters to be ready.\n\nDATE TIP: Yes yes yes!",

That's what I can come up with right now as I think back on the deliciousness that was our meal.\n\nFirst off, their bread is crazy good. I know they say don't fill up on it, but I love carbs and I sort of did. But I don't regret it. Also, try the caprese - it was perfect.\n\nFor dinner I did a pre fixe option with a Cesar salad, stuffed salmon with vegetable risotto and for dessert I got the chocolate amaretto cake. How I wish I could have that entire meal right here, right now!\n\nThe salad was fantastic - everything seemed from scratch and the dressing was out of this world. The salmon - a huge portion and stuffed with yummy goodness like shrimp and other things. It came on a bed of vegetable risotto and although that was just slightly overcooked, the salmon more than made up for it. The chocolate amaretto cake was decent - good even - but I was missing the amaretto. Just not quite enough kick there.\n\nThey've got a GREAT wine list and even though the service was a little slow, our waiter was pretty on top of it and attentive. He knew the menu well and gave some great suggestions. It's the real deal Italian - worth stopping by if you're in Nashville.",

It's also a bit pricey but you absolutely get what you pay for.\nWe ordered a muffaletta with a mix of house cured meats and olive spread. The meats are seriously perfection. Amazingly fresh and so tasty but just way too salty, especially with the olive spread! It was my first time having a muffaletta and I liked the bread, but I didn't love it\nThe pork belly sandwich is a must try. The pork belly melts in your mouth and is bursting with flavor. If it weren't so salty, it would've been the perfect sandwich. The cucumber slaw was delicious and refreshing but it still couldn't cut through the saltiness of the pork belly and the creaminess of the mayo.",

I asked the cashier if it was normal for them to be out of so many things or if the store has issues getting deliveries and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about.  I now have to go to a different Target and had to take a trip to the grocery store afterwards. So not worth it.

I can't confirm the licenses of anyone who works there sabotaging is posted besides payment options & proving. #whomp\n\nRegardless of what you get, the prices are the same. I requested the foot/body combo for 50 minutes. Their pricing really doesn't make sense when you do the math from one length of time to the other. The lady explained it was 20 mins on feet & 30 on body. It was pulling teeth when we insisted on 10 mins on feet & 40 minutes on body. \n\nWhen they do your foot massage, you are seated in black leather recliner (which should be BrookStone massaging chairs). The chairs are prepped with white towel that they do not change between clients. The foot massage is done by hand and it's decent\n\nYou then move to the table for the body massage. There is an open partition but no real privacy as you are out in the open. Due to the body massage station being in the open, you are fully clothed during your massage. Fully clothed and then they cover you with towels so the process is not as deep & effective as you'd like. We got a couple massage & the massages would have been relaxing if the therapists would have kindly shut their traps. They talked in Chinese the entire time. No, not whisper, just chatting it up. We just did our best tuning them out. After the massage is over, they rush you off the table and out the door.\n\nI'm used to a different level of service & skill set so this place only gets 3 stars from me.",

  "text": "Um, so much yes about this place!\n\nI was seriously craving some non-Chipotle type Mexican food on a casual Saturday, and since one of my friends said this was his favorite, a bunch of us decided to try it out. \n\nHard to describe the ambiance of this place; it's a peculiar but appealing blend of hole-in-the-wall and fancy. On the one hand, it's pretty small and a bit shabby with tiled walls that resemble the interior of a diner. On the other hand, as my one friend kept insisting, it has wine glasses and candles on the tables so it can kinda qualify as a date spot. Also, the service is excellent, with friendly waiters dressed in all black to add a little more class. \n\nOn top of that, the food is delish, particularly the tacos that my friend got and kindly shared with me. My own \"enchiladas de mole\" was good, but I'd probably default to their tacos in the future. A memorable dish of the night was one that my other friend ordered, some special dish that was legit ginormous (but also twice the cost of anyone else's dish). I can't even remember what it was called, so I'll just leave it as the mystery menu item, and maybe you can figure it out from the blurred picture I managed to screenshot from the tail-end of my snapvideo! He said it was really good, although he also commented it might be the most expensive dish he's ever ordered at a Mexican place. That's def the anomaly though; everything else there was very reasonably priced and worthwhile imo.",

The restaurant ambiance was on point - low lighting, sophisticated decorations. But food-wise... \n\n==FOOD ORDERED==\n\n1. Pork cracklings $1 (4/5 stars): For $1, this is the best deal of the night. Great snack to go with beer/drinks, the fried pork skin is crunchy, fresh and fattily delicious. \n\n2. Boudin Balls $4 (3/5 stars): Not bad, but I had better ones at multiple restaurants in New Orleans already.\n\n3. Crispy Oyster & Caviar Taco $8 (3/5 stars);\nIngredients: Louisiana oysters, Cajun caviar & Crystal hot sauce aioli \nI only had a bite of these tacos since it was my friend's order. They tasted OK, nothing stood out but nothing was bad. Average tasting tacos. It is not spicy (the hot sauce is sweet).\n\n4. Dirty Duck & Mirlton Bread Pudding $8 (2/5 stars); \nIngredients: pulled duck leg confit, foie gras nibbles & jalapeno cornbread with foie gras fondue & bourbon old fashioned duck sauce\nDuck is my favorite meat. But I couldn't even really taste the flavor of duck meat here as the entire dish is covered with a weird combination of sauces. Rather than jalepeno, because it wasn't spicy at all (seeds taken out) it tasted more like the duck was wrapped in a large green bell pepper. Everything put together was just too sweet for my liking :(\n\n5. Crispy Confit Pig Ears $7 (2/5 stars);\nIngredients: ghost pepper spiced red bean puree, grilled green onion & Steen's molasses gastrique\nHmmm... so I'm usually used to eating Taiwanese pig ears that are slightly chewy/tendon-y with chili oil drenched on top. When I had it here, the pig ears are dried out almost like dried squid, and don't believe the \"ghost pepper spiced red bean puree\" description - if there were any hints of ghost pepper I didn't taste it. It's completely 100% unspicy. Not a fan of this dish as it's way too bland.\n\n6. Gumbo $8 (2/5 stars): Ehhhh. So salty!! Holy crap, it was like drinking salt soup. We mentioned the issue with the gumbo with the waitress towards the end of the meal but her response was kind of abrupt - \"Oh... I guess I could take those off the bill.\" No, we'd rather not if you \"guess\" you'll take it off... that's just awkward.\n\n==ALCOHOLIC DRINKS==\nThese were good. At least they got the drinks down. Yay.\n\n==PRICING==\nPretty cheaply priced for a higher end restaurant. With everything it came out to $115 pre-tip, for five people. \n\n==OVERALL==\nSad to say, this is one of the few spots in NOLA that I wouldn't be back for. I had a good time because I was on a fantastic vacation with my friends, but the restaurant itself lacked that wow factor to have me coming back for a next time.",

  "text": "I saw some people eating here on fb & the food looked pretty good, so I decided to check them out. Now the Yelp reviews said the food was just OK, & my fellow Yelpers were correct! I ordered the shrimp po Boy, the soft shell crab, & the gumbo. The gumbo was DELICIOUS. Soft shell crab was different, it was my 1st time eating it so I don't have anything to compare that too. It was fresh & hot & did have a lil flavor. The poboy wasn't good at all. The shrimp was bland and the sandwhich was lukewarm at best. I was definitely disappointed with the meal. I expected more. \n\nService was ok, the guy didn't really wow us. He just got the job done. So that was that. Overall I think New Orleans has better food options. I wouldn't be interested in a round 2 w/them.",

  "text": "Hands down, the best meal I had in New Orleans. We were walking down Bourbon Street, and we just happened to turn down Orleans Avenue, where we found this amazing restaurant. \n\nThe setting inside is beautiful and classy, yet very casual at the same time. The servers are very kind and cheerful.\n\nThe wines - I had a glass of Weingut Max Ferd Richter Riesling, and a glass of Moscato D'asti dessert wine. Both wines were superb.\n\nAppetizer - I had the New Orleans BBQ'd shrimp that was served with the most delicious, creamy sauce, and French Bread.\n\nFor dinner - A nice portion of Filet and a very generous portion of Lobster Tail. The BEST. The Lobster was served with browned butter, that almost tasted like caramel. The Lobster was sweet enough that I didn't even need the butter. The meal also came with very tasty garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThey offer a cheese and wine meal on the patio, and I wanted to come back another day to try that. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to go back. If I ever visit New Orleans again I will definitely be dining here.",

  "text": "We went there on the Thanksgiving day. We called the day before and twice the morning of Thanksgiving and they told us they are all booked and they are not taking any more reservation. We happened to walk by around 11am, went in and asked again and they said the same thing. While looking for a place to eat a couple hours later, we happened to see a line in there. So we went back in again and we were able to get a table in less than 5 min. \n\nOur server was great super nice. There was some live jazz which was good but  it was very short. The part that I was excited about was the food which sucked. Turkey was dried, ham was dried and the rest of the food was also not tasty. The place was super crowded. Every time we had to stay in line for 20-30min to get food from buffet. I won't go back.",

  "text": "This tiny little joint is just a stumble & a stagger from Colby's Cocktails and puts together some damn tasty Mexican...Now looking at this place from the outside you'd be judging a book by it's cover & honestly this book would look a bit sketch since this place is located in an old house trailer....Inside you got maybe 4-6 tables but hey they can put together some delectable eats! So get over any concerns and get in there and get your grub on....Was told they didn't serve booze but the cooler was stocked with a variety of cervezas...was well pleased to see they carried my favorite, Sol!!\n\nCommunication is a bit tricky cause not too much English is spoken or understood here so you gotta get by with pointing but for me the food was totally worth it! In prior reviews (Cantina Laredo, Mia's Tex-Mex, Casa Maria) I've spoken of my love for brisket tacos....This place did a shredded beef taco with the beef soaked in it's own juices that, while not called a brisket taco, was damn tasty and rivaled any of the brisket tacos I've had in the past...\n\nI ordered 3 of those tacos with cilantro, onion and avocado and with the salsa verde poured on top it was a Fiesta for the taste buds!!! I've found my Mexican place in Metry!! The other Yelpers I was with all loved their orders and my mouth is watering for those tacos as I right this review...I'll be back sooner rather than later cause this place is a hidden gem....",

  "text": "It's impossible to eat healthy in New Orleans.  I proved this at Mother's.  I ordered the grilled fish with veggies and grits.  We took a seat in the back and waited for our orders.  My friend said, \"You got grilled?  They don't grill anything here.\". Good point, turned out she was right.  My friends were pretty much done with their lunches by the time my fish finally came.  The server even said, \"mm mm mm, you got grilled???\". OK, I get it, lesson learned.\n\nThe remarkable thing is that they managed to grill the fish in tons of butter and with the skin on.  The fish seemed to have good flavor, but I wasn't able to separate the skin so that's all I could taste.  I was laughing because even the veggies had ham in them.  I will say that that was the best cabbage I've ever had.  Grits were creamy and good too.\n\nSo overall, A-OK.  Next time I'll stick with the fried.  What was I thinking trying to eat healthy anyway?",

Granted it was early, but we only waited in line for about 10 minutes. I went for a classic cheesesteak with provolone. Of course, I added some mushrooms and onions. The cheesesteak was great and pretty filling. I also had a few of a friends cheese fries, and the whiz was pretty good (normally I stay away from whiz at all costs). \n\nAnyways, I definitely recommend Sonny's if you're looking for a pretty good cheesesteak.",

  "text": "Greasy greasy- that pretty much sums up the panini I had here. The panini was mediocre in size and stuffed with eggplant, broccoli rabe, and provolone. Sounded like a winning combo. The eggplant was slimy (gross). The rabe was bitter (also gross), and the whole sandwich was soft and sort of falling apart. I felt like a picky 5 year old (and I pretty much eat everything) as I took out all the fillings and basically ate the oily bread. Everyone else didn't seem to have the same problem I did so must have been the eggplant, broccoli combo that I picked. \n\nIf you order more than $25 worth of food you get a free pitcher of sangria- sweet! Except that the sangria was really not sangria, but fruit punch with a touch of cheap wine?? I'm not sure what I was drinking, but it definitely wasn't sangria. What do I expect- its free...There's way too many places to get a decent meal in Philly. Panini's is definitely not on that list.....",

  "text": "11/24/17\n\nWow, I'm pretty damn famous here!!!  So, here's the deal: this restaurant is the very most recommended restaurant throughout New Orleans believe it or not!  We took numerous uber's and taxis, and every single driver told us to come here when asked where to eat.  Every.  Single.  One.  (Second place was Acme Oysters, but who cares about second right?)\n\nSo what was it like?  Well, to me, this restaurant was exactly how I picture a popular New Orleans restaurant would look inside and out, but not just any popular restaurant--one packed with locals.  I would say that it was generally about 80% African Americans, and 19% various Caucasians making up the nearly 150-200ish people stuffed into this rather large restaurant.  Oh... and... 2 Asians.  Me.  Her.\n\nSo, get this, 3pm on a Fri afternoon, the waiting area overflowed outside, with dozens of families inside waiting for tables.  Yes, 3pm.  I cannot imagine how crazy it would be at normal hours!  Must be pure insanity.\n\nBut........... we walked right passed everyone, and as if God wanted us to be happy, two seats were empty at the bar.  Hell yeah, we immediately sat our asses down!  I would say, based on my observations while consuming our meal, that the wait was probably more than hour long.  I do believe that some people that were there when we sat down were still standing there after we left.  So BE PREPARED for some ridiculous waiting if you want tables!\n\nUnfortunately we didn't have enough time to burn through our food adventures from earlier in the day, so we could only eat so much...\n\n1. NOLA Irish Channel Stout (American Stout) $7.50:  This was a GREAT find!  I never thought of Louisiana as a beer-loving state.  More of a Pabst or Miller place I figured, you know, piss in a glass.  But holy cow this NOLA (produced?) beer was a knockout!  Mega rich and with that pure cocoa bean kick.  Like butter and dark chocolate mixed up.  Somewhat similar in architecture to a Guinness but 10x stronger and tastier!  I really gotta try more Louisiana-made beer now.  9/10\n\n2. Half Platter $35.95 \"[half as much of] a bounty of fresh shrimp, oysters, catfish, soft shell crabs and crawfish balls, served with french fries\"... that's a ton of stuff man... just look at that giant MOUND of fried goodness (really, check out my pics!)...\n\n2a. Soft Shell Crab:  Amazingly, I found some roe inside.  At an American establishment!  I could only find crabs like this at Chinese restaurants.  Totally delicious!  Spicy  Perfectly fried.  10/10\n\n2b. Crawfish Balls:  Well, this was different.  It's soft and mushy in the middle.  Almost like goop.  But it totally works!  Just the most savory, most intense flavor emanating from the center.  Like a ball of really thick yummy stew rolled up and fried.  Love it.  9/10\n\n2c. Catfish:  Their catfish seemed kinda soft strangely.  Not sure why.  But anyway, it has less of that distinct catfish texture than I'd like.  Also, could use more seasoning.  6/10\n\n2d. Oysters:  Yeah, also not my thing.  They cut the oysters up to make smaller pieces.  I would really much more enjoying biting into a huge, plump, fleshy lump.  But otherwise, it's still pretty juicy and flavorful considering that they increased the surface area, exposing more to the frying process.  7/10\n\n2e. French Fries:  Completely unremarkable.  5/10\n\nOh!.... and....\n\n2f. Coleslaw:  I cannot believe how enamoured I was with their coleslaw, which was actually very typical looking, superficially.  But it was just so fresh, crunchy, tangy and sweet.  The sauce was thick, very unlike the watery stuff in most other coleslaws.  I think they have sliced apples inside.  Might really be the best coleslaw I've had in my life!  10/10\n\nSo there you have it... was it the best fried seafood I've had in New Orleans?--honestly, I've had better catfish and some other stuff the last time I came to New Orleans half a decade ago at different restaurants, but overall, the fried foods were consistently excellent.\n\nAnd of course, you get that local New Orleans vibe!  If you can stand that ridiculous hell of a line, you'll be well rewarded.  Trust me.\n\n5/5\n\n#neworleans #friedseafood #softshellcrab #friedoysters #friedcatfish #crawfishballs",

I wanted to write a solid review for them, though, because the employees helped me pick out some amazing treats to bring to a holiday get-together.  They also didn't make me feel like a freak with food allergies; they really listened and treated me like every other customer, which I appreciated.  I was looking for a variety-pack of sorts, but then I was torn about possibly getting sticky buns instead.  I explained that I was headed to a party and the lady recommended I pick out a few of their brownie, cookie, and fruit bars for people to try.  She then proceeded to cube all them and place them neatly in a box so that everyone would be able to get a sample of each.   My coworkers were really impressed with each one (peanut butter blondie, double chocolate brownies, etc.), but they all agreed that the lemon pretzel bar was the winner.  This area of Washington Avenue is a little rough around the edges, but I'm glad that there's an excellent bakery up there that's doing some pretty sweet business.

Gone are the days of heaping pickled cactus floating in oil. Guacamole was also perfectly prepared, with the roasted sesame seeds bringing a wonderful richness to the large portion of tuna heaped upon avocado bliss.\n\nOh, how we long for the tuna salsa of old. May the Starr gods hear our plea to have this and the manchego cheese re-added to their pantheon of Salsa. Truly, the tuna, crab, and manchego flight was the best offering we had ever had from these kitchens.\n\nWe tried the black bass tacos, and the new presentation is both tasty to palate and eye. The mahi-mahi taco still reigns supreme. \n\nKeep up the Stellar Starr Service Sean and Stephano, and we hope to see the kitchen bring us those dishes that made you the great flagship of the Starr chain.

Featuring frozen custard in a single flavor - vanilla - with hundreds of possible combinations of mix-ins to formulate your own customized concrete we were fortunate to arrive at an off-hour and after opting for four \"Micromini\" cups at $1.80 each the selections were packed in a bag with blocks of ice and spoons putting us back in the air conditioned car to enjoy less than 10 minutes after pulling off Route 66.\n\nSoft, smooth, rich, and not overly sweet on its own I will admit that I did not flip the cup over to see just how \"concrete\" the concoction was, but certainly thicker than standard softserve despite the heat and humidity I've little doubt all but the melted portion would have stayed put.  Skipping the sundaes or options with too many variable and instead going with two fruit options but two choices suggested by the young woman at the counter I personally found the Tedad and Blueberry to both be excellent while the butterscotch was a bit thin and the sour cherry too artificial.  A fun spot and one of those \"must visit\" landmarks I cannot say I'd go out of my way for Ted Drewes, but I definitely wouldn't drive past it on a cross country trip - particularly in the middle of summer.",

  "text": "We came in on a Saturday night it it was pretty busy but we're able to be seated right away. Our server was very helpful especially after I ordered their beer samplers. He had to smell some of them in order to tell me which one I had ordered. Thought it was funny but knew it was something he had to do. J had ordered the Red Cider Wings and the bomb burger. It did take awhile to get the food, but hey it's Saturday night, they're busy and I have a lot of beer to sample. Let's just enjoy the night. \n\nI wasn't to crazy about the bomb burger. I'll just stick to your traditional burger. Felt like there was to much pizza dough and stuffs you up very quickly and felt like it absorbed too much of the juices and made it more difficult to eat. I'm not saying it wasn't good. It was damn good. One of those things where you don't mind trying different at least once. \n\nI would definitely come back, they had very good beers here. Service was amazing.",

  "text": "Well I have been coming here for years and it has always been a must stop for me and my family until this last visit. The prices have been jacked up and then you add in the parking fee across the street it becomes an absolute joke. Let me first say since moving to the South 3 years ago I have learned how to make the delicious muffaletta at home so it's not nearly the treat it used to be. I make it at home and it's so good so the need to drive to NOLA is not necessary unless you are in the area. I picked up my sister from the airport and of course she loves the place so we had to stop in. The price for the sandwich went up around $5 and everything was way marked up since the last time I was here (maybe a year) and at about $15 a plate now, it's just not worth it for me.  If you are a tourist you may want to stop in for lunch because it is a good sandwich and everyone visiting NOLA needs the muffaletta experience. After the $24 parking fee and the $50 lunch tab (3 sandwiches and 3 Cokes) plus a tip well it just became a $80 lunch. Not worth it and honestly I won't be back.",

  "text": "Glad we stopped in. The jazz on Frenchmen street is known for bringing in a less crazed crowd. The atmosphere right away was calmer. The band playing was mesmerizing. The female vocalist had a lovely raspy voice that took you to rustic simpler times.\nThe drinks were intricate and tasted light. \nMy only confusion was that a we (a group of 3) went to the bar and upon seeing no seats- asked for a table (which there were 2) but we were told to go back outside and wait. We waited maybe 5 minutes. They said we would each have to order a plate to get a table. Only one of us was going to eat so they told us to go back to the bar then. We tried making space at the bar and then like twenty minutes later they said we could sit at the tables after all. I guess they had been waiting for more people who would dine and figured it wasn't happening. When a server passed by and we asked for another drink- she abruptly said we would have to order from the bar so my friend made his way to the bar again. It felt like we were bouncing from one end to the next so that interrupted us from enjoying the music at times.",

They have lots of specialty toppings and ways to fix your sandwich. You pick the bread, protein and  side. \nWe had a few drinks... a spiked milkshake (not sure when this became popular, daughter likes them) I got a cold one, son had coke. All came out quickly along with our fried pickle appetizer. It was a cup of thinly sliced, tart pickles, lightly floured and season cooked nicely, I little greasy but we gobbled them up quickly. \nWe each got a burger, the fineness was not right on the kids burgers so they did a biology, dissection of their hamburgers to trade patties? Which I said we can just send them back, they seemed okay with it, we mentioned to the server because you hope they will look at their process and be better next time. The server promptly got the manager and she was very nice and said she will look into it. Which was fine, again just wanted them to know. \nAll good we finish and the bill comes back with no drinks on it, not our intention to get free things, this manage wanted us to have a better experience. Thanks again to the staff and yes we did tip to the full bill ! \nI will be back!",

I had the butternut squash ravioli appetizer and loved it. The server and his assistant were always close by. There are tons of specials offered every night. I lived in this town but only went there once near the end. After trying the food, I realized my mistake. Because it is located on the far end of Farnsworth, people tend to overlook it.

I really couldn't tell the difference between the two, but both were delicious! \n**FYI, if you don't know how to eat these: bite the top off of the dumplings and pour in your desired sauce (usually vinegar sauce on the table), THEN sip/eat the dumpling all in one bite.\n\nKnocking off one star because of the service and some entrees (not as tasty). Don't get me wrong, they were very quick to get our order.. but they were really rushing us and gave us attitude for not knowing what we wanted yet. \n\nBe prepared to know what you want to order ASAP, but the food is delicious and super reasonable/cheap prices. Also, stick to the appetizers. We ended up ordering too much food, so I would suggest ordering as you eat. The food comes out quickly so don't worry about sitting around and being hangry.

So maybe you can squeeze your way through if you have connections or look as if you do. \n\nI tried the fresh oysters as well as the rockerfeller styled chargrilled oysters served with bread. Both were delicious and fresh. I also tried a soft shell crab po-boy that I thought was just ok (the crab was good but the bread was ok and it was bland because there was nothing else in it besides shredded lettuce). The hush puppies and fries were also ok and the fried shrimp was tasty (not too oily, perfectly breaded). The fried crab claws had sweet meat & were really fun to eat.

Maybe I'm spoiled since I live in Chicagoland, where there are plenty of fabulous restaurants.\n\nWe were celebrating an upcoming wedding and they seated us at a round table with a nearby spot to place the gifts on.  That table was almost an afterthought, crammed in the corner, just like us.\n\nThe service was ok, but she could have really done more with recommendations and just doing things like taking about plates and glasses faster.  We had a drink spill while the bride to be was trying to open a gift.  There just wasn't enough room.\n\nI had a hard time ordering because they use lots of sauces and I have a dairy allergy.  Yes, it's a pasta place, so you have sauce there, but many of the breakfast entrees are saucy as well.  I ordered a salad which was fine.  The other people in my party ordered breakfast and lunch items.  I didn't hear any raves about it.\n\nOverall I was a bit disappointed here.

Great atmosphere from the architecture, to the furniture, to the music in the background. The french doors were open to let in the breeze and the sounds from the street. Almost wanted to sit at the sidewalk tables, but too many carriage tours pass by for that, ha! \n\nThat morning they were running a tasting menu for a great price - choose an app / entree / dessert - so my husband went that direction and loved everything! App of fried green tomatoes w/ shrimp, entree of crawfish etoufee, and dessert of bread pudding. He washed it down with the strawberry lemonade, made in house, and also super tasty. I went with an egg sandwich served on a croissant; I added spinach and onions for extra deliciousness. One of the best yet simple breakfast sandwiches I'd had in long time. Washed my meal down with a $15 bottle of Champagne (can't beat that!). The prices were super affordable, and well worth the stop in for a great meal. We'll definitely be back!",

I also asked for a cup of jambalaya. The sides were all very tasty, but I am not a fan of the shrimp creole. The shrimps were overcooked and it was just really not very good. \n\nHowever, given the fact that my choices for the sides just seem to be a really bad combination, I would have been more forgiving had the staff been nicer. I don't know if it was because I have gotten spoilt by the niceness and hospitality I was shown before this visit, but the staff at Mother's just seemed to be so unhappy to have customers. Nary a \"hello\" or a smile was to be dispensed by them, it seemed like. \n\nI think it was Phyllis Diller who said that \"A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.\" And really, I would have taken the blame for the less-than-impressive meal I had if the staff had shown me even the smallest hint of a shadow of a reluctant smile.

The barbq sauce was like sweet baby rae's lil cousin ..better than I expected.\n\nMashed Potatoes and Gravy: 1/5 yeah ok uh Well the good is that it was hot but now the bad: the mashed potatoes had a taste like straight box instant taste. \n\nBiscusit:0/5 KFC has the worst biscuit in the chicken fast food game. This shouldn't even be called a biscuit but a bread roll lump d lump. I had to mix it with the mashed potatoes. Popeye's come save me!!!\n\nCookie: 2/5 Nothing to write home about. Tasted like those 3 for $.99 chocolate chip cookies @ Walmart\n\nStrawberry Soda: 5/5: The best was last.....

I'll focus on the swamp tour but we were able to schedule on the same day with no problems and even added a friend who arrived after without problems either.  The bus ride was bumpy, don't sit right over the wheels in the back because every time we hit a bump, I hit my head and I'm only 5'9\"!\n\nOnce we arrived to the swamp, we were taken on a tour by Bishop, our knowledgeable and friendly guide.  We were loud and rambunctious, but he was great about it.  We went in February and the weather was cold, in the 40-50s during the day so bundle up! Once he speeds the boat up, it is COLD so be warned.  Since it was the winter, we didn't see many alligators as they were hibernating and come up sporadically for air.  I got to see the various animals in the swamp which was cool and learned about the local plant life as well.  I got some great photos which was nice.  Since we missed out on seeing actual alligators in the swamp, we had the opportunity to handle a baby alligator in the gift shop after the tour.  I got to take photos.  \n\nAll in all, an enjoyable tour.  I liked that since I was visiting and didn't have a car, they were able to come to pick us up for the tour.  Fortunately I got to sleep during the ride to the swamp.  Just remember to pick your seat carefully so you don't bump your head, dress warm if you go in the winter and enjoy.  Fun guide and fun times! I can't complain!",

I had accidents, illnesses, you name it, and it happened to me. \n\nWhen I (actually being sober) fell down my stairs in my house ended up on crutches.\n\nOf course the medical supply store was closed so Pootchie and I drove ALL over Reno to every Wal Mart, Walgreens and CVS at midnight looking for a pair of crutches and THIS CVS was the ONLY store in all of Reno that had crutches for my height! I'm 5'6 which apparently is the most popular height of people who break their legs because they had plenty of crutches for people shorter or taller but none for me.\n\nSo this CVS became my favorite place just because it meant I didnt have to hop around like a lunatic.",

It says, \"People know quality when they taste it.\" I must agree with him and on my visit today, my ButterBurger tasted no different then a burger I'd get at the Golden Arches. So, today I am taking away a Star on my Yelp rating. \n\nMy guest and I were both craving a ButterBurger and could not believe our disappointment. Seriously, they were no different then the ones we'd get at other fast food chains. Our onion rings didn't seem to be the same either. \n\nHowever, the crinkle fries and the Root Beer were still the same quality we remembered. I also, give a shout out to the staff. They were upbeat, cheerful and full of energy. I don't know if they were short staffed, but those working had some pep in their step and were getting things done at a quick pace. \n\nI'm hoping the drop in burger quality is just a pandemic thing and not the way of the future. I'll be back or I'll stop by another Culver's in the near future to see how things improve. \n\nWhen: September 1, 2021\nWhy: Needed a ButterBurger",

Fustian Asian Bistro got me excited again to have real Chinese food, like I use eat it at my favorite Chinese restaurant in Germany. The fuchsia atmosphere is very pleasant and warm, the server was very friendly answering the many questions I asked about the menu, I ordered the chili chicken soup, it was wonderful! And I also ordered the vegetable spring rolls, they were so good, I place two extra orders to go, for the main meal I ordered chicken with peanut, cashew, chili and cucumber. It was pretty good, but the cucumber was too slippery for an inexperience chopstick user like me. Since I am a big dumpling fan, i ordered the shrimp dumpling, they tasted so good, I know i will be going back soon for more. Overall, I had a real wonderful experience at the Fushia Asian Bistro, I will be going back with a bunch of friend so we can sample more food.",

Nothing special but I didn't hate it.\nWe shared a hot basil chicken because usually at Thai places, one meal and two appetizers are way more than we need.\nNot so much here... The chicken seemed old and the cilantro was over-powering the basil (Love basil, hate cilantro). The waitress took an extra 20 minutes to bring our bill AFTER the plates were cleared...so we sat there at an empty table all that time trying to flag someone down without being too rude. Finally I just help up a hand and yelled. She didn't like that too much but such is life.\n\nAnd never trust a reviewer that can \"promise\" you that all reviews that don't match theirs MUST be from people who never ate at a place.\nBecause seriously...How arrogant is that?",

  "text": "This was my first time having Five Guys.  I'm sure I'll be back.  Not often, because it would probably kill me, but I'll be back.\n\nI went with the regular which is actually two patties.  I also chose \"all the way\" which was everything in black on the menu for toppings.  Off the top of my head, lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, pickles, mustard, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms.  Wow, this was a freakin big burger.  Next time I'll go with the small (one patty)\n\nThe burger was pretty good.  I can say that my taste in burgers has definitely been skewed by the fancy burgers I get downtown.  This is a whole 'nother category.  This is like a fast food burger but with really fresh toppings.  Sure they give you two, but it sits pretty damn heavy.  The bun was nothing to speak of.  It was a bit soggy by the time I ate it because it soaked up the stuff that was on my burger.\n\nThe fries are great!  When you walk in they have 50lb bag of potatoes on the right hand side and they even have a small chalkboard showing you which farm they are from.  Nice touch, I like that.  When you eat them, they aren't battered, just cooked properly.  Crispy outside, soft inside.  Everything a good fry should be.\n\nSo I'll be back.  I'll tone down the burger order and most likely enjoy my experience a bit more.",

I finally had the chance to stop by today prior to our afternoon Yelp event. \n\nSince my visit in 2013, FCD has added more flavors and more liquors. In addition to their Vodka, they also sell four different flavors of Moonshine, two flavors of Gin, and two flavors of a Bloody Mary Mix (they had me at bacon). \n\nI tried so many flavors it was hard to keep track! I tasted the Beach Bum Berry, Weeki Wachee Watermelon, Miami Mango Vodka, and the Okeechobee Cherry. Of the four, the Beach Bum Berry was my favorite.\n\nI also tried two of the Moonshines: the Sunrise and the Sunset. The Sunrise tasted of a fresh baked apple pie, buttery vanilla, with a hot pepper kick. The Sunset was my favorite which tasted of English Toffee with a hint of oranges.\n\nThe Bloody Mary Mix was also delicious! There are two flavors available: Chipotle and Bacon. I tasted the Chipotle and it wasn't too spicy for a wimp like me. \n\nJessie and Tamara were very personable and attentive during our visit. We were even treated to two amazing cocktails: one made with the Lemon Lime Vodka and Ginger Beer and one made with the Strawberry Vodka and Lemonade. Both cocktails were delicious! Thank you for adding to our Sunday Funday! \n\nA word to the wise: if you don't drink too often, you may want to eat something before you start your tasting. \n\nFCD is open Thursday through Sunday and is available for private parties and tastings. Definitely stop by and give Florida Cane Distillery a try!",

That bothered us.  Then while we looked at menus I noticed the prices on mine were $1 more than the prices on my wife's menu.  That bothered us.  We each ordered a chicken burrito, not expecting much of anything. Then...like a switch was flipped, the food arrived.  The burritos were like tortilla wraps that had been pressed in a panini-press.  The chicken was tender white meat, & the accompanying ingredients were fresh & flavorful.  They mixed in avocado, tomato, lettuce, beans, rice, & cilantro.  The server brought out sour cream & a delicious salsa which we topped every bite with.  The flavor combo was equivalent to deliciousness-on-steroids.  Sure, the price of each burrito was the higher price found on my menu.  But the food was so wonderful, everything that bothered us disappeared.  We are excited now to take friends here.  The place is a tiny hole.  The menus are different from each other.  The server doesn't wear a mask.  And there was a language barrier since they speak Spanish & we only speak English.  You know what?  Adversity makes for adventure!  What an awesome experience!",

  "text": "My lunch experience at iNDO yesterday was phenomenal! I am so happy to see yet another great restaurant pop up in the Botanical Heights neighborhood. \n\niNDO's lunch service is casual, walk-in counter service as opposed to their dinner service which requires a reservation. Right when you walk in the door for lunch, you'll see a friendly staffer at the counter ready to take your order. If you need a suggestion on what to get, they are happy to share recommendations for your food and drink options. \n\nI ordered the Tom Yum Pork Skins, the Pork Lettuce Wraps and a canned 1220 Spirits Lemonade and Lavender drink. \n\nThe staffer then gave me a number and said I could sit anywhere I wanted. And they meant it because I sat in what is probably the waiting area for dinner service! I wanted to witness all the counter interactions for lunch. No judgement though! \n\nThe Tom Yum Pork Skins arrived first, and man oh man were they tasty! The tom yum powder sprinkled all over the fried pork skins is so flavorful! And what an incredibly crispy crunch! Dip it in the included Chive Aioli and you've got yourself a savory mouth party! \n\nAfter demolishing the pork skins and while waiting for my lunch entree I watched the genuine interactions happening at the counter and bar area. Curious folks stopped by to take a peek at this new Chef Nick Bognar venture. The staff, including Nick, greeted everyone who came in, were happy to talk to people about the restaurant and give them menus to go, and chatted it up with patrons sitting in the bar area. \n\nWhen my Pork Lettuce Wrap entree arrived it was gorgeous. Never have I seen a more well-styled lettuce wrap dish in St. Louis. The pork strips were tender with lots of juicy fat for flavor. The real flavorful showstoppers in this dish though are the sauces included. The orange sauce is creamy, savory with a bit of heat while the green sauce starts out sweet and has a spicy finish. \n\nI can't wait to make a dinner reservation soon to experience iNDO's omakase (I'll leave it up to you) style dinner service. Thanks so much, iNDO!",

  "text": "Acme Oyster House came highly recommended from almost everyone of my friends, family, and co-workers that I asked about for places to eat in NOLA so I knew it was without question that my friends and I would have some sort of meal here, one way or another! To my dismay, I found out that they didn't take reservations so I just told my friends that we should try to go during off-peak hours, preferably the Monday during our stay since we didn't want to experience the waiting times on Saturday or Sunday.  \n\nAfter we did a late morning walking tour of the city, we were famished and took a chance in going to Acme to see how the lines were. We were pleasantly surprised when we only saw a dozen or so people waiting in line. Someone was outside going down the line taking names - when they got up to us, they said it would only be about 20 min for 4 people. They asked us if we wanted seats at the bar, a table, or whatever came first. We were pretty hungry so we all agreed that whatever came first was just fine. We were seated in about 15 minutes. \n\nThe menu was not large at all but basically EVERYTHING looked appetizing on it. We ordered a  1/2 dozen of the Raw Oysters and a  1/2 dozen of the Chargrilled Oysters to start off with. We also ordered a round of their Cinnamon Toast Crunch beverage which was Fireball Whiskey and Orchata Cinnamon Cream Rum. The drink was delicious! There was also cinnamon and sugar outlining the glass which really made this drink a dessert more than anything. The Oysters came out after a little bit and the raw ones were huge and so fresh, it was like you were tasting the ocean. The Chargrilled ones were just as mouth-watering. I ordered the Seafood Etouffee and asked for a side of the Fried Crawfish Tails. Up until this point, we hadn't yet had a chance to try Crawfish and since our trip was quickly nearing to an end, I figured even if it was just the fried tails, that we get to experience them. The Etouffee was AMAZING. I had never had this dish before but the flavors were just out of this world. The roux was super buttery and rich. I ate every drop of the dish and used the rice to mop up every last bite. Back in Jersey, I'm already doing Yelp searches on restaurants here that serve Etouffee. They probably won't match up to NOLA's but my taste buds definitely want more!\n\nEven though we were stuffed, we had to try the New Orleans Bread Pudding w/ Whiskey Sauce and we cleaned the plate! It was delish!!\n\nThis was probably my favorite place to eat in NOLA! Super causal, delicious food, and even with drinks, our grand total wasn't crazy!! Looking fwd to returning whenever I'm back in NOLA!",

They have a few signature pizzas and build your own (obvz), but I went for the Greek Pizza. Olives, onions, fresh tomatoes, green peppers and feta cheese. \n\nI placed the order then went back 30 mins later to collect it. The lady who served me was lovely! She was super friendly and even gave my daughter a lollipop and a colouring sheet to take home. I told her I recently moved nearby and she gave me a menu to keep, I had no idea they also do deliveries! Great to know. Looking at the menu... it's a lot more than just pizza and steak, there's salads, pastas, donairs and burgers. I haven't veered from steak and pizza as of yet. But happy to know I can get a steak dinner delivered to my door ;)\n\nBack to my pizza.... I got a large for three of us to share and it was enormous. It is more like a deep dish pizza, all those toppings stashed under the delicious cheese! You can't pick any toppings off, which could be an issue for kids or picky eaters. Because the toppings were hidden, my daughter ate it all, including the olives! Even the base sauce was rich and flavourful. I can't fault it. I'll definitely be choosing Dallas over any other pizza place around. \nIn fact, I'm eating the leftovers for breakfast right now, and it's still good.",

Sometimes foot massages focus on weird areas and end up being more uncomfortable than pleasant - however, this was anything but that and my little feetsies were so happy afterwards.\n\nThe overall ambiance is nice - no private rooms; however it is very clean, professional, and quiet with peaceful music (same three tracks on repeat), and the price is basically unbeatable. While getting my foot massage, I noted some of the other masseuses really seemed to know what they were doing, so perhaps if you get the right masseuse, the body massage would be better.",

  "text": "This was my first evening in Philadelphia, and our hotel is close to Chinatown (what a lovely surprise)! After exploring many historical sites, our feet were tired and we were ready for dinner. Sakura was awfully packed, so we picked up a take out menu to explore as we walked through Chinatown. Fatigue got the best of us and we returned to Sakura and ordered Edamame, Egg Drop soup, a Spider Roll and General Tso's chicken. We were welcomed with a pot of tea, not a cup, but a pot! The food was delicious, but the service could have been better. Sometimes hungriness blinds me and makes time crawl. Overall, it was a wonderful first real meal in Philly! Looking forward to more this weekend!",

The Shredded Pork Ho Fun noodles are also just incredible. And these are just my favorites - I've tried several other buns, dumplings & noodles with friends at Dim Sum and have always been blown away by the flavor. \n\nI never felt rushed in their old location, and wondered if things would be much slower in their new one. While the place is larger, the service is still pretty quick, and the staff is as friendly as ever. Throw in the fact that it's a BYO and you can't get a more delicious meal for less anywhere else in Chinatown.",

It was one of the cheaper, but classier places in town.\n\nOur service was a little choppy at first because of a misunderstanding, but our waitress eventually greeted us and everything went uphill from there! \n\nInstead of bread, they give you biscuits and butter which was very decadent, so I didn't end up eating too much. \n\nI ordered the Thai sandwich (sriracha aioli, peanuts, blackened chicken, no teriyaki pig candy which is basically kind of bacon) and it was really good. The peanuts were a little much for me after a while but the flavors were so good, and the chicken had a perfect amount of kick. It came with a huge pile of house chips which were good, but I was stuffed just after eating my sandwich. I also got an Arnold Palmer, which was sweetened only with lemonade, but I found myself not needing any sugar. \n\nMy dad got a burger and my mom got a salad which she ate all of - and she doesn't usually have a big appetite!\n\nIf I lived in the area, I'd definitely visit again.",

  "text": "New Orleans is where the voodoo culture came into existence.  It's an underground religious practice that terrified many, including myself.  In hopes of learning more about voodoo, I purchased a ticket for the Haunted History Voodoo Tour which was $25 per person.  You can buy your ticket online OR come to Reverend Zombie's Voodoo Shop. \n\nAs a forewarning, before you purchase, they tell you that this voodoo tour is NOT meant to scare, but to inform.  They hope to disprove that voodoo is NOT as evil as Hollywood portrays it to be--at tour's end they did just that. \n\nThat night, my tour guide was Daphne, an authentic voodoo witch doctor who truly practices voodoo everyday.  (supposedly the ONLY voodoo tour guide that practices)  I felt lucky to have her because she was enthusiastic, hilarious, and knowledgeable about voodoo practices.  While walking the streets of the French Quarter, Daphne told stories that was educational and entertaining.  She taught us the history behind voodoo while showcasing the famous landmarks of Marie Laveau, the mother of Voodoo.  She even showed us some personal artifacts that she uses everyday too!\n----\nConclusion: Daphne did an excellent job of piquing my interest for voodoo.  If curious about this culture, I recommend it.  Ask for Daphne as she's one of the better story tellers I've come across.  I just wish they would implement a food/bar crawl with the story telling! Remember to tip your tour guide or else they'll put a spell on you! Jk\n\nExtra Notes:\n-CASH ONLY at the Reverend Zombie's Voodoo Shop, but ticket can be purchased online with credit card here:\nhttp://www.neworleans.com/tours/shop/french-quarter-voodoo-tour/\n-Arrive 30 minutes before departure time\n-Each tour lasts for about 1.5-2 hours\n-Tour is only available on Friday-Sunday\n-Bring an umbrella and dress in layers\n-Wear comfortable shoes\n-No restroom breaks",

With a definite southern flair, the food is imaginative and interesting.\n\nNot being a southern girl, myself, some of the things that are on the menu are worth trying . . . .things like okra, hominy, pickled this and that, and cornbread puree . . .none of which is common on menus in other parts of the country.\n\nSo imagine my delight in the Carolina flounder dish that I picked which was two small pieces of flounder atop a mix of okra, beans, peas, tomatoes, corn accompanied by some type of light sauce.  Delightful and light.  Good thing it was light for as a side I went with the truffled mac and cheese which was delicious with just the right amount of bread crumbs and cheese.  \n\nKnow before you go that portion sizes are not large, rather they are restrained.  So if you are used to getting a huge plate of food this is not going to be the case here.  Also know that the prices are steep as well- my fish entree was $34 with no sides.  Add in a $7 side or two and you are quickly reminded that this is fine dining.\n\nAnd you gotta love a place that serves Jack Daniels ice cream for dessert.  Yep.  A small scoop, albeit, but it was delicious with just the right amount of flavor.\n\nThe ambiance is classy, after all, this is The Hermitage, and the staff is welcoming, informed and well trained to make your evening an unforgettable experience.\n\nDefinitely a great choice for before the theater or for a special occasion.  Guess I'm going to have to go back as I never did learn what clabber cream was on the menu.  Ah . .the joys of southern cooking!",

We sat at the oyster bar since no tables were available. I wanted to be introduced to New Orleans food, so I ordered the New Orleans medley. It had seafood gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and grilled smoke sausage. It was delicious. And so far, I still have no stomach ache while writing this review which is a positive. A coworker ordered the chargrilled oysters and I was offered several. They were just awesome. The chargrilled oyster was my favorite food there. And it should be, since it is an oyster house! Also had some of my coworker's fried shrimp player which was good. Anything that is fried is usually good. \n\nThe employee at the oyster bar didn't seem to be in the greatest mood, but he may have just been tired cracking open the oysters. Nevertheless, we received our food quickly and our hunger was satisfied. If you want grilled oysters, this is the place to go.",

There are 2 within a mile of my house and couldn't be happier.\n\nThis particular location has been my location of choice and believe this one's layout and offerings are more than sufficient.\n\nI have even found more recently with higher demand for gluten free products and more healthy options, they have stepped up and stocked some different options in both of these areas.\n\nI order bakery and deli specialties, I request special things from the meat counter, the staff is always very nice and usually very helpful.\n\nI am not a fan of the fish counter, I don't find the fish to be very good...and when I've requested a certain brand of black beans, they've ordered/stocked them and have continued to keep them stocked!  When the Diet Rite white grape flavor was all of a sudden missing from the shelves, I requested to order those and received a call stating that they don't produce it anymore.  Any time you have a question, you will find someone to help.\n\nThe store is clean, it is easy to find times to go when it is not crazy busy and again the convenience of where it's located is a huge plus.\n\nThe cakes made by Publix are AWESOME and their desserts are really great.  Some of my traditional faves here are the carrot cake bar, the chocolate tres leche (I don't even like tres leche) and the eclairs.  The turnovers (cherry or apple) heated in the toaster over are great too!\n\nVery happy with this store overall and typically don't shop anywhere else.",

  "text": "If you take just one thing from this review, it should be: Go for the \"top shelf\" Margarita.  It's just $2 more and it's hard-core--no Margie mix.  I saw one of the servers pouring four \"top shelf\"s together for another table while drinking my humdrum house version.\n\nI learned something that night.  You're going to invest $7 in a weakened cocktail.  Why not spend 28.6 per cent more for, like, a 100 per cent better drink?  If you can't afford $9 for a quality beverage, but you can handle $7 for averageness, better get down to basics and stick with water, which is also good here.\n\nThe food is fine for Reno Mexican.  On the Gilbert's (Pico at 26th, Santa Monica) Scale it's a solid 3++-star, divey hangout in a modest Sparks strip mall.  Prices seem a little steep for the 'hood--they parallel Gilbert's--and Macho's surely doesn't have the same monthly nut.\n\nCarnitas wet burrito (enchilada-style) was decent, a 50-50 mix of meat and refried beans, which for me is not enough meat, and enchilada sauce that was bland in light of the eye-opening spiciness of their chilled green and red salsas.\n\nCarnitas taco salad was workmanlike, housed in a freshly fried, fluted flour tortilla shell--unique in that it was pleasant to munch on, and didn't taste stale and/or rancid.  Corn tortilla chips were another bright spot, homemade and not greasy, not warm either, but nevertheless addictive.\n\nLast word: It's called Macho Tequila's.  You didn't venture into the bowels of Sparks to be some flatland-tourister, house-Margarita wimp.  Make the trip worthwhile!",

  "text": "Did you know that if you want some of the best mind-blowing barbecue of your life, then you have to wait at least four hours for it?  I'm sure some of you Indy Yelpers find this to be totally absurd.  Who waits that long for pork?  Yet everyday, people camp out to eat brisket and ribs at Franklin Barbecue in Austin, TX, and everyone will tell you that the wait for 100% worth it.  Your meal smokes the competition.\n\nI connect this situation to Kuma's Corner.  Fact: Kuma's is a top-ranked burger and mac 'n' cheese joint in Chicago and has been for several years. (If you don't believe me, then google it.)  In the 10 years that Kuma's has been around, they have been ravaging your mouth with explosive burgers.  Take the Goatsnake, a monstrous amount of beef topped with herbed goat cheese, corn and poblano relish, lemon vinaigrette, and buttermilk-breaded red onion.  The description alone makes you think, \"Damn!  Get into my mouth now!\"  Well, just wait until you do shove that dead cow in your mouth.  I won't be too graphic, but it's going to drive you wild.\n\nBased on my experience at Kuma's, the ravaging has trickled over to Indy no doubt, yet have we welcomed this famous, critically-acclaimed shop with open mouths and stomachs?  Not quite.  We over-critique the time it takes for our metal burgers to come out.  What's the rush?  Do you know there's beer to drink?  Is your date going that terrible that you have to take out your frustration on the food being brought out slower than you'd like it to?  Who knows, maybe I'm being a bit of an overprotective mother bear with a place I truly enjoy.  However, I think we as a Yelp Community need to ask ourselves more often: how much weight should we give to the time it takes for our food to come out?  Do we knock 'em three-four stars because of a slow and steady pace? Better yet, should we prioritize service or a kick-ass plate?\n\nWith that said, Kuma's: I love you for who you are, not for who certain Yelpers want you to be.",

This review is just for the breakfast/brunch menu.\n\nFood - I have never gone wrong with the egg bowl, burger & fries (i love their fries), savory oats, stout waffles, and country ham toast (this sandwich is HUGE and better than any other ham toast I've ever had). Everything is so flavorful, especially the savory bowls. I wish I could make these dishes at home, but I would never get the flavors to be as good, so I will never regret ordering these dishes here. Avocado shake is alright, not a big cup, but if you're craving and willing to pay, sure. I'm also excited to come back and try other sandwiches and the roze bowl too.\n\nDrink - their drink menu is really extensive and I've only had the golden turmeric and black sesame steamers - both lovely. The right milky-ness and not sweet at all. Roze latte is pretty good. Made pretty with the rose petals on top of the drink.\n\nService - If you don't want to experience slow(er) and less attentive service, I'd recommend coming at off hours. I had one not so great experience, but made up by with a dish on the house. But - I'm also a very patient person, so the mishap didn't bother me that much.",

  "text": "My friend and I are both fond of this creole bar and kitchen, not least for the fish and seafood that features heavily on the menu. Seriously good taste of creole cooking of shrimps, fish and all types of meat. Wings, burgers also feature and as expected, breakfast with waffles, proper biscuits. Our lunch kicked off with Jerk wings and three pieces of different charbroiled chicken breasts (S.O.S), followed by two orders of entrees. Both were very generous in portion. The 4 Horsemen were partitioned by 4 sample dishes ranging from black bean stew, crawfish in creole sauce to shrimp and sausage jambalaya, chicken with garlic prawns in Cajun spices. \n\nWe were surprised by the imagination of the extemporaneous instantiation in the entree IDK, which was loved by my friend, besides, the deviation from our preconceive vision as reminiscent of a beach hut like maritime-themed furnitures or jazz, soul and blues music. The atmosphere was laidback, fun and welcoming, helped along by the emollient nature of the staff. The walls are painted with spring-green and grey paintwork, and in addition to simple blond-wood tables and chairs, the spacious room was decorated by arcade machines and a pool table. Expect, also, games and matches and occasional yelling, providing the soundtrack to the bites and booze.",

I thought it was just like New Mexico Blake's and although they claim it's the same, the food is far different. \nFirst off the drive through is like waiting and dying a slow death. Granted the food is fresh but waiting 15 minutes with no one in front of you is annoying. \nThe bun was very stale and blah. The burger itself had zero seasoning. I got the green chili/cheese burger. How can it have no flavor? Not sure, but it was flavorless. \nI had my hopes so high but unfortunately this place did not live up to the name. \nI'll stick with getting my fix when I'm in New Mexico.",

Neither of us liked the craft soda so we both drank sweet tea and I had mine with some lemon aid. Southern. crispy Chicken strips were very tasty crisp outside and juicy and fully cooked. Mac M cheese great. Loved the shoestring fries. For dessert we had the Nutella Poppers. They were also very good. Didn't love the decor or where the drink area was only because you had to get past thru the line of people waiting to place their order. I'm guessing this will be easier as the newness wears off.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much information the tour guides had to share with us. I left with a greater knowledge of the area's culture and history which I found very interesting. \n\nWithin the swamp, I was blown away by the natural beauty and thankful that May offered comfortable temperatures. Although wildlife sightings are never guaranteed, we were lucky enough to see several alligators, wild boar, raccoons, and snakes. The tour guide did a great job keeping the experience fun and interactive, even between sightings. \n\nConsidering the transportation, time, and knowledge of the guides, we felt that the price was reasonable. I would recommend this to nature-lovers of all ages. \n\nI hope to return for a seasonal sunset tour on my next visit to New Orleans!",

Tons of butter all over the plate which was fantastic for dipping our bread into. 2 dozen oysters and two Sauvignon Blancs and we were out the door for $70 tip and tax included. Not the cheapest but one of the best. So far I think the char grilled oysters at Delmonico are the best we've had.",

In NYC, there are several steamed pork soup bun restaurants that would rival Dim Sum Garden.  \n\nGiven that the steamed pork soup bun competition in NYC is really good, my expectations are kinda high.  In short the skins for these buns are too thick, the flavor of the broth isn't as complex, and there have been some instances when I felt the meat wasn't ground cleanly.  I will however drop by if I am in the neighborhood and need a steamed pork soup buns fix since they are better than the rest in philly.  Now we have settled that argument, onto the other items on the menu,.....\n\nThe steamed chicken dumplings are also good and recommended.  The chicken sticks are also tasty and nicely prepared.  The fried shrimp was fried nicely without an overbearing greasy residue.\n\nThe crystal shrimp dumplings wrappers were kinda thick and probably not something I would order again.  The sauce for the pan fried noodles were really bland and saturated with a little too much sauce.  The amount of sauce in the dish basically made the pan fried noodles a soup noodle dish.  Definitely not ideal, and not recommended. \n\nOverall, I could revisit Dim Sum Garden again.",

  "text": "Let's correct a slight misconception about Chipotle: This is not health food, nor is it light, by any means, despite the marketing hype displayed at all locales touting their \"food with integrity\" etc etc. This formerly-McDonald's-owned chain serves some mighty tasty grub, and I enjoy it on a fairly regular basis. However, you might want to recalculate your ordering and/or sharing habits.\nA standard burrito here, with the tasty pork, rice, black beans, salsa, cheese, sour cream and flour tortilla weighs in at a whopping 1200 calories. That's just shy of your normal daily allowance if you're an average male. Therefore, I almost always split one of these in half and share it or save it for later because half is about a normal meal, calorie-wise. And that's not including chips, which I never get, or any type of sugary drink which I always avoid, as well.\nYou can have your Taco Bus, Tampa. I will take Chipotle. It tastes better and the quantity is not stingy. These ubiquitous chain restaurants are also very clean, with usually quick service even when there is a line, which is often at mealtimes. I see no differences from one location to another, though parking is tight at Westshore, and there can be a shortage on S. Howard if you go when the nearby bars are peaking.",

I've been here twice and have gotten to-go orders each time. The food is fresh, fast, and flavorful. The first time I came I ordered three tacos with chicken, steak, and pork with chips and queso. Everything was great! I returned a few days ago and asked for the same order, but sadly they were out of chips and queso. It was around 7:30pm on Sunday. That was disappointing, but I ordered the kimchi fried rice instead. It was good as well. The prices aren't bad but being a la carte, things certainly add up and the portions of the menu items are small, so buying multiple things is to be expected.\n\nBefore coming here, I had heard about Seoul Taco being great but hadn't been to any of their locations. This being so convenient to where I live in Chesterfield was a welcome surprise. West County needs some flavor and this establishment definitely brings that!",

Our server, Melissa, took great care of us. Friendly, laid back explanation of the menu, assurance on portion sizes. Thank you! Service is quick and it's fun to watch your entree being put together by the kitchen.\n\nI selected a couple of small plates to try, meatballs and broccoli rabe.  Two large meatballs are constructed of beef, veal and pork and stuffed with fontina, cooked perfectly. Not tough, juicy and tender, topped with melted mozzarella. They are flavorfully spiced with a slight kick, just enough to stimulate the taste buds.  They're served atop a dollop of polenta and delicious, sweet plum tomato marinara sauce. \n\nThe broccoli rabe was disappointing.  Sautéed with white beans, garlic, chile and lemon it was very bitter, while I was expecting an earthy, garlic crunch. \n\nMy colleague tried the eggplant parmigiana. Artfully plated in 2 elongated, criss-crossed slices, the eggplant is prepared with basil pesto, topped with marinara sauce and burrata cheese. \n\nWe also tried the wild mushroom arancini.  Golf ball sized balls of wild mushroom risotto are stuffed with mozzarella and deep fried golden brown. These are served with a splash of truffle ailoi.  The arancini were my favorite of the night.... Creamy and savory with a nice crunch in every bite. \n\nSolid food at this small restaurant. I'd return to try the rest of the menu.",

I can't get enough of them. I only allow myself to go once in a blue moon, because my sweet tooth gets me in so much trouble.\n\nThe staff is so friendly and now during COVID-19 they only allow a handful of people in at a time and there is no indoor dining. I honestly always grabbed my ice cream to go and walked around the neighborhood, such a pretty area.\n\nMy go-to is a split small and tbh it's a good amount! If you love queso be a foodie like me and order a waffle cone on the side. Break it up into \"chips\" and you can thank me later.\n\nGo get yourself some ice cream!",

Now, I don't \"party\" so my b-day din is the equvalent to a childhood party where all my friends come and i make favors for them and we all have pizza and cake. except we go to a semi-nice place that I normally wouldn't go to. I sought out a Meditarranean BYOB and on one of my travels home from Trader Joes, I happened upon the tucked away spot, and found the inside beautifully warm. I was met with friendly, helpful servers and a host who took my information and after making a reservation I was confident my party - and my party - would be well off there. \nAnd we were. And it was. \nMy servers: handsome, attentive, and personable. Did I say handsome? Oh, yeah, I did.\nI had my first tryst with escargot here - perfectly done jouicy snails in a light as air tomato broth - Med-style, not French - and for an entree had pan-seeared diver scallops that were so meaty and melt in my mouth it was hard to believe. Other guests had the Moussaka, some veg eggplant dish, a halloumi and feta dish, among others, and all were met with raves. \nThis restaurant is classified as Middle Eastern - I take issue, only because the menu is more eclectic than Middle Eastern, and contains elements of all the Meditarranean rim, including heavy Italian and North African influences.\nThis place is a gem, and really does have a menu that can please the most diverse of tastes. The noise level, the ambience - even the comfortable seating was just so perfect. As well as it went over for my shindig, I couldn't help but fantasize about having a quiet date there in the future. \nAnd more escargot. I have a taste for snails now. Be warned. \nAnd it was then the voice of Obi Wan came over me and spoke: \n\"You have learned well, my young Padawan.\"",

To be fair, we did stay a while as we kept ordering food and drinking wine (It's a BYO!), but service still could be greatly improved. \n\nDO order the soup dumplings, shu mai, and really any types of dumplings on the first row of the menu. Our shrimp dumplings was tiny so I would steer away from that, but you really cannot go wrong with the soup dumplings. Their vegetables (garlic stems) are also very, very tasty and authentically cooked, reminding me of what my mother would often cook at home to get me to eat more vegetables. DO NOT order other non-dim sum dishes; they're completely not worth the price or taste. My friend and I ordered only dim-sum items, and was pleasantly surprised at the cheapness of how much food we had eaten (although the soup in the dumplings are composed of liquid fat..but what delicious liquid fat! just order some vegetables to balance it out). \n\nWarning, they don't take reservations, so steer away from busy nights if you're in a hurry! We waited in a line that extended out of the door for over 20 minutes.",

It was a good portion of salad for the price. The Angus beef, spicy buffalo and blue cheese burger was tasty. The blue cheese was not very overpowering which I liked. The burger was very tasty. We also tried the Beef kabob. This dish comes with some lettuce and red onions on top of fresh flatbread. I think the most memorable part of the meal was how good the bread tasted! It was warm, light and fluffy. There were also three sauces you could put on your flatbread and meat. There is a spicy orange one and a white garlic cream sauce that I thought tasted good on the flatbread. \n\nThey also have a 20% discount with a student ID or you can buy the $15 for $20 on Yelp which makes this place even more worth try! I will definitely come back here when I am in the area and looking for some light, clean food!",

  "text": "Our first visit here for a Saturday lunch verged on 4 stars, or at least some aspects did. The small interior is clean and fairly spartan save for a few colorful paintings. They offer a Yelp checkin offer for free mango lassi( provided you select a dinner entree) which was good. And even offer lunch specials on the weekend. If memory serves vegetarian ones were $6.99, carnivorous ones a buck more. \n\nBut therein lied our first complaint. While providing more than ample plain( ish) basmati, there was less than ample meat and sauce. We did both agree the butter chicken was good, but twice the sauce was needed at least. One other issue is that it cane out instantly, while my choice was about 10 minutes behind. This does not make for an enjoyable date lunch when both parties were already hangry. Also not appreciated was the plastic compartment plate it was served on.  My chicken biryani was very good and a very good portion.... of rice at least. Again the fowl, which was a mix of white and dark meat that had been roasted I believe( with plenty of spices) was lacking. But for the price I would get again. Our order of cheese naan did not live up to expectations and is not worth repeating. \n\nI would recommend this place for a quick in and out lunch, or for coming with a group and ordering a few dishes to share. The tandoori chicken options are interesting to me, but take over 25 minutes to prepare. Lastly, even though the owner was present and seemed very nice, our server had a bit of an attitude. I think another try is warranted, but based on the few negatives we would probably stick with our old faithful Blue. Let's say 3.66 medium spicy my ass stars",

Unfortunately, it seemed to be pretty packed, and the parking garage had a sign that said $20, so we just passed by and found something else that night.  The next day, though, the weather was decent, so we took a walk over from the NCAA Hall of Champions to try it for lunch.   \n\nThis is a national chain that touts \"service with sarcasm\" but honestly, our waiter was pretty ordinary and didn't really say or do anything funny.  We enjoyed the semi-abusive comments made by some of the other servers while we were there, plus some of the kind of funny remarks on the big paper hats they put on customer heads.  The seating arrangement is crowded, with everyone sitting at long tables beside strangers, if it's crowded.  Prices were a little high and portions were a little small (maybe a dozen fries in my basket - easily the smallest side of fries I can ever remember).  It all tasted pretty good, though, got a decent meal and had a few laughs.",

My favorite side we ordered for the table was a special that night - lobster Mac and cheese!! It was seriously amazing! \n\nWe ended with coffee and desserts.

Will it be a dive with your shoes sticking to the floor, and the food indigestible?  Or, will the place have a pleasant personality and tone with decent grub given its inherent limitations?  \n\nVery happy to report that China Wok is the later.  \n\nThe small space is clean and bright, with the owners/operators equally so.  The menu is adequate for both lunch and dinner, but as I was here in the afternoon for a late lunch, I went with the lunch specials.  Orange Chicken, Fried Rice and a drink (water) for a very reasonable price. \n\nYes, it was served in its take out container, but in an interesting way.  It came on a tray with the take out menu opened fully to act like a placemat.  Pleasant alternative to just having the various folding boxes placed in front of me.  Too, the smile that accompanied the service was an unexpected bonus.  Could have used a spoon along with the skinny plastic fork, but why quibble? \n\nThe meal was on the high end for cheap Chinese walk away.  The Chicken was not heavily coated, and it appeared it had not been frozen for long, if at all.  It was soft and pliant without that freezer burn toughness so often present.  The sauce was properly piquant with slices of Orange Peel and Red Szechuan Chili throughout.  The Fried Rice was decent with small chunks of pork and veggies. \n\nAll in all, a surprisingly good meal.  While it would never be confused with fine dining, it was certainly substantial enough without the obvious pitfalls of fast Chinese, that it is worth another visit.",

  "text": "I'd seen Paint Nite deals floating around on Living Social and Groupon, so when a friend came to visit from out of down I decided to buy one and sign us up for a Sunday night painting party. When I originally bought the deal from Living Social, it was quickly cancelled, which was a disappointment. However, a few days later I noticed the deal on Groupon, so I bought it again - clearly there are some technical/promotional issues, but thankfully, this time it was on!\n\nWe did a Sunday paint nite at Head House Crab & Oyster Co, on 2nd and South. The space was huge and the restaurant and bar were pretty dead on Sunday at 7pm, so I can understand why they'd welcome a crowd of 30 painters - especially when those painters are being encouraged to drink throughout the entire class.  I understand the reciprocal relationship of Paint Nite using the space and encouraging people to buy drinks from the bar, but the pushiness was obvious and got a bit annoying after 2 hours.\n\nAs for the class itself, we painted \"Fireflies\" - an abstract sort of image that is evidently their most popular piece. Although the instructions were vague at time, it was an \"Easy\" level painting, and so they came out fairly well. Perhaps the most interesting and fun part was to walk around and see how 30 different people could interpret the same scene so many different ways - although I have to admit, it inspired some artist envy!\n\nOverall, the novelty of painting your own masterpiece, while being able to sip drinks, makes for a fun night out, especially if you gather up a group to go. At $50 a person, I wouldn't pay full price, but there seems to be no shortage of half-price deals floating around on the inter webs. Not sure if I'll be a repeat customer, because really, what do you do with a bunch of giant hand painted canvases? Nevertheless, check it out yourself, eager to see more reviews up here!",

Ever since the whole rolling ice cream train hit Philly, I've been a bit skeptical to try new icecream places that looks gimmicky because they're usually overpriced and very mundane in flavor. \n\nArctic was not the case, while they were pricey, the quality was worth it. I had pandan ice cream coconut bowl with kiwi, coconut flakes, bananas and sticky rice in a coconut bowl. The sticky rice was main draw here. The rice was sweet and added a very interesting texture. The rice soaked up the ice cream as well as the toppings and busts with flavor when bit into.\n\nI initially thought $8 for a bowl of ice cream was much but it was definitely worth it. The only issue was seatings. The only way to truly appreciate your coconut bowl ice cream was to dine in, there was no point doing take out as presentation was half the dish. Their flavors also switch daily so check back often.\n\nSmall but cool spot with very delicious ice cream. Limited but exotic flavors help this place stands out from the rest. Lack of seatings can be annoying but you can always take out. Highly recommended.",

[Since it closes at 10pm it doesn't quite make it onto my \"Munchies For Night Owls\" list (to make it on this list, a place must be open at least til Midnight) - and we got there at 9:30pm.  But still, they let us hang out til 10:20pm, so we never felt rushed.\n\nTHE SET-UP\n\nMy sweet friend and I had just finished a party at Indulge Grill Island and we were working our way back to Hotel Modern, but we decided to take a quick side-trip since we were looking for something to satiate our sweet-tooth.\n\nNow she was from New York City, and how she found this place I don't quite know since this was her first time to New Orleans too, but I am so happy I decided to let her take charge of this night because she was firing on all pistons.\n\nTHE TASTE TREATS!\n\nThe food here looked amazing.  And I kept telling myself that I would come back earlier in the evening one of the days I was here, but, alas!, that was not to be.  So I am glad I enjoyed this fun moment of tasty sweet fun!  We were definitely feeling the need for ice cream, and so our selections reflected that, and we pulled the trigger on two (2) items that we shared:\n\n*  BLACK FOREST BERRIES - which was a delicious mix of hot blueberries, raspberries with vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and a fudge sauce drizzle; and,\n\n*  APPLE STRUDEL- which was right on par with what I was hoping - a very fluffy apple filled pastry, and we opted to get it with the scoop of French Vanilla ice cream.\n\nDECOR \n\nThe café is very sweet looking, and though German, the décor & style definitely reflects the Czech-Hungarian origins of these owners.  So there is definitely a wonderful, diverse Central European vibe to this awesome place.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN\n\nA Fantastic Trans-Altantic Tastegasmatic experience here in New Orleans!",

Then again I loooove potatoes in general.\n\nWe got this fried seafood platter which came with shrimp, catfish, and oysters on a bed of fries. Wow...so crispy n deeeelish. \n\nAlso got a crawish/shrimp pizza which is more like a small thin crust but it was actually just nice to eat. Seafoody and greasy good pizza. But someone who is picky about pizza may not prefer this. I am not so I welcome you pizza!! \n\nThose two plates fed three STARVING women. We were completely full and destroyed everythingggggggg",

No one at my table could get them down. On a previous visit  I ordered the chicken tacos and they were just very ordinary. Normally delicious. My last visit I ordered the Mexican chopped salad with a side of chicken. Salad was pretty good and I really enjoy the avocado dressing they supply but again couldn't eat the $5 chicken side because it was doused in so much salt. -- Also service is meh. Waited for almost 45 minutes for two salads. Plenty of other Mexican spots in the city to branch out too from now on.",

  "text": "I had been hearing a ton about this place and was normally deterred due to the 1+ hour wait times I had heard about.\n\nMy wife, her friend, and I decided to just suck it up and try it out, knowing that wait times maybe up to an hour or more.\n\nWe went on a Monday, hoping that there it wasn't going to be really busy, and we were right!\n\nThere were only two groups in the restaurant at the time. I had never been here before, so the bartender/server behind the counter was very helpful. He explained that the menus were on the table, and when we were ready to order to come up to the counter and order. They usually call out names when the orders are ready, but they weren't super busy so they brought out the pizza to us.\n\nThe menu is on each table in one of those plastic things that you usually see some sort of happy hour or weird looking ad promoting a club. There's \"art\" everywhere. Almost every single wall is covered in writing or pictures, some people even managed to make it up to the ceiling. There's a table shuffleboard on a wall and in the back are two dart boards.\n\nWe knew we wanted the Chicago style pizza, but didn't know what we wanted on it or the size. We ended up getting a medium with bacon and mushrooms.\n\nSince I heard there were always super long wait times for the food, I timed our order. To my surprise it arrived in 20 mins! Probably because they weren't busy.\n\nUnfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the pizza. The pizza was SUPER cheesy. I really like cheese, but even this was too much. It was like Pizza Hut's stuffed crust pizza, except instead of just the crust being stuffed, the whole pizza was. I felt like there was so much cheese everything else on the pizza was overpowered. I barely tasted any of the bacon, mushroom, or sauce. I basically just tasted a ton of cheese and a little bit of crust.\n\nIn my opinion, the Chicago style pizza isn't worth the 1 hour wait, but I would come back to try the normal style pizza.",

I nearly stopped in my tracks when the bag of marshmallows came out to be over $11!!  The king cake was lightly sweet and moist with cream cheese and cinnamon filling.  Delicious and the only thing that was a good value there at $4 for a big slice.  Despite its price tag, I was a sucker for its prettiness and had desserts for dinner a few nights.",

  "text": "The Capitol Grille quietly makes its case as one of the country's best hotel restaurants. \n\nThe restaurant is located within the gorgeous Hermitage Hotel in downtown Nashville. It's southern business casual versus formal. Jacket isn't necessary, but you don't exactly want to show up after a game of tackle football. Decor is refined, elegant, and comfortable. Service is friendly and straddling between informal and informal. It's fun though. \n\nYou'll have lots of choices of appetizers, entrees, and sides. But it's variety doesn't compromise. It's seasonal. It's local In fact, many (if not all) items come from a nearby farm at Glen Leven. \n\nDinner was exceptional. Gulf snapper (with brussel sprouts, celery root puree, crab burre monte) was delicious. The most savory dishes - the braised braised pork cheeks (with corn bread puree, cabbage, soft poached egg) and the venison (with collard greens, heirloom sweet potato, huckleberry shallot jus) - were absolute home-runs, with buttery and tender meats, juicy, bursting with flavor. We sampled several of the sides too. The truffle mac & cheese is truly excellent. The honey-glazed heirloom carrots and brussel sprouts and bacon were delicious too, but played second fiddle to that mac & cheese. Dessert was a dark chocolate with mint. \n\nChances are you'll be full, bloated, and incapacitate by meal's end. After you leave the restaurant, take advantage of this state and relax in the lobby of The Hermitage Hotel. You may find staring into the stained glass ceiling therapeutic. \n\nNote: The Capitol Grille (with an O) is not related to The Capital Grille (with an A), which specializes in steaks, steaks, and more steaks.",

So why do I love it?\n\nI like many others in my day enjoyed more than one very cheap 2:30 AM meal here. Call it nostalgia. \n\nBut really, how can you not love a place that keeps their signature breakfast dish under $4 in this tough economy? $3.89 for the Blue Ribbon Special at this time of writing.  And it includes coffee.  No one beats it.\n\nStopped in after many years today and sat at the counter like the old days. Grabbed a jumbo Jomo burger which wasn't too jumbo. But at $5.69 including fries was certainly a worthy deal. Not the best burger ever but it was good enough. \n\nThat's this place in a nut shell. It's good enough. The prices are what make it worthwhile. \n\nI don't think the place smelled like stale smoke at all. The whole cleanliness complaint comes from overly picky people. It ain't a country club by any means but there are far worse places in terms of clean.  It's fine.  I think they finally purged that smoke smell. \n\nAnd the orange booths are incredibly tacky, and I hope they never get rid of them. It wouldn't be Tom Jones without them.",

  "text": "Frozen custard is delicious! When I first moved to St. Louis Ted Drewes was on my list of places recommended by many locals. I can understand why. This is a touristy spot and even the locals come here and wait in line for their sweet treat! \n\nI remember my first visit very well. I had no idea how to order or what to order. I was so overwhelmed with the choices. While waiting in line I was reading the menu and asking for tips on what to order;  however, instead of trying to try something different I simply asked for a M&M Concrete; it was that simple. Thank goodness! I was nervous I was going to order incorrectly. \n\nNow that I have gone back a few times I have tried their Great Pumpkin and I also tried some kind of cherry concrete with dark chocolate. Both were really good, but I'll stick with my traditional M&M concrete since it is simple and sweet. \n\nIf I ever have friends come to town I know I can take them here-I explain that the lines will be long and we just have to be patient. What's really funny is that even in the cold winter months people still wait in line-no way! Not me. I prefer to eat my concretes during the warmer months. \n\nTed Drewes, I will come in the spring.

The decor is antique themed, carpet, wallpaper, old photos and lots of wood.  The antique theme is very literal and it translates to old, tired and rundown. The carpet and wallpaper are stained and old and they look  like no one cares about improvement.  The quality of the food is also mediocre, but  portion size and price balances things out.  Overall a good neighborhood gathering place and a place to stuff your face with a lot of meat.  If that's what you are in the mood for and ambience is not an issue, this is your place.",

This is truly one-stop shopping, whether you're vegan, gluten-free, all organic, or couldn't care less.  My mom loves shopping here when she knows I'm coming home.  She can get all her usual stuff, and also grab vegan cheese for me.  The bakery is great, I love their sourdough.  They even have a small bulk section, so I don't have to buy a big bag of expensive nuts when I only need half a cup.  I've found everything from Go Max Go peanut butter cups to Hurraw! lip balm to Pacifica candles here, this place is amazing.\n\nAnd then there's the prepared foods.  There's so much good stuff!  It's one of the few places I feel cool with grabbing sushi from a supermarket, and they usually have awesome and inventive vegan rolls, like mango and tofu.  The seaweed salad is on point, too, and it's turned my mom into a seaweed believer.  My husband loves the Indian hot bar.  It's not the best, but it's comforting and it hits the spot.\n\nAND THEN there's the beer.  There are crazy laws in Pennsylvania that prevent grocery stores from selling alcohol, but Wegman's craftily put a pub and a beverage store within their store, making the impossible possible.  I can get Einstok and Dogfish Head and Yuengling, AND all of my groceries.  Even in California, I don't usually find Einstok at the grocery store, so this place is truly heaven.\n\nThanks for making vegan speciality items (and beer) so accessible!",

I shared a large bowl of Pho and it was more than enough for the two of us. The bowl was huge! Definitely go with the large if you have the option to share with someone. \n\nI also ordered the summer rolls, which were nicely wrapped in rice paper with fresh ingredients. I liked the accompanying peanut sauce too. \n\nThe interior was clean and spacious. Service was fast and efficient. The food is good, prices are great, and portion sizes are awesome. I would definitely eat here again if in the area.",

They came by right on time, took a quick look at the door and told us we needed to replace the springs and rollers. The cost...$250.\n\nWe felt that it was a big commitment to make on the spot, so we decided to get a 2nd opinion. The next company that came by immediately observed that someone had used the red rope (so that the door could be used manually) and never put it back. Literally 2 seconds later, they reset it and it worked fine. They didn't even charge us.\n\nWe obviously didn't need the spring and roller replacement that Master Garage Door Services recommended. I feel like they either misread the situation completely or tried to upsell us on services we didn't need. Either way, we were none too pleased.",

  "text": "I wasn't sure of what to think with the 3 star reviews, but I can tell you this was a solid 5 on some levels and a solid 4 on others. For example, service was a complete mess and a 3 to 4, but as far as atmosphere, vibe, and food plus drink; it was a 5. \n\nBetween the live music, the Greeks that surrounded this place, belly dancing, live music, ouzo, and poor decisions, we made this night worth it. My sister, cousin, and her boyfriend plus myself were here for 4.5 hours. We drank, ate, and socialized the night away. It almost felt we knew everyone. It was a fun and social environment that engaged everyone despite of where they came from. For the most part, people were wearing masks. I was when I was not eating or drinking.\n\nI can vouch food was authentic and far from Americanized. I spent 17 days in Greece 3 years ago, and I tore up that country's food scene. It was wonderful to experience something close to the authentic thing here in America. I would've never known that a Greek community existed in Tampa if it weren't from my cousin. It took my sister by surprise as well. She recently relocated her and is still adjusting. Covid times being what it is, my sister is not getting out and exploring very much.\n\nIf you want a fun vibe with a chill ambiance of people, this is place to come. You can't go wrong with a bully dance, live musicians, and a singer singing solely in Greek. It was wonderful. \n\nCome try Mama's when you get a chance. Also, bypass 3 the stars. It exceeds more than just an OK experience.",

  "text": "We had some tasty tacos here today! But, the hit of the visit was their homemade hot sauce! That is some serious hot sauce. It will frizzle your hair and bring on the sweat! Now, back to the tacos...\n\nWe tried both Mexican style (cilantro and onion with lime) and American style (cilantro, lettuce, cheese, tomato, onion, and sour cream with lime) and both were flavorful. Both kinds are $2 so you don't need to bring a ton of money. As for the meats, they were out of almost everything so we were left with Al Pastor (good flavor) and beef (much too bland). Apparently, they were busy today!\n\nTo order, you go to the lady standing near the food. They make everything and then call your name. You pay later, when you are done, and just tell them what you got. So, there is no fancy numbering system or receipts. Just your honor!\n\nWe sat in the gas station/convenience store ambiance and enjoyed our meal. They were actually attentive, clearing away used plates and such and bringing us more hot sauce to melt our skulls. My only complaint, once you get past eating in a convenience store, was we were a little disappointed we couldn't try more meats but perhaps next time.",

I've had it a few times recently and this place has made me remember how much I love all things Mexican! The tacos were simple but stacked with meat and they came with all of the accompaniments like lime, cucumber, cilantro and spicy, fresh sauces. The enchiladas were very soft and flavorful, and the chicken inside was cooked perfectly. You can tell them make everything as you order but, but the wait wasn't absurdly long, only at the end when getting the check was it a little extra time. On a lazy Sunday, not a huge problem. Order takeout if you're in more of a rush, or just enjoy the process, grab an agua fresca, and wait it out!",

  "text": "I absolutely love noodles. \n\nSo I just had to come here once I heard about Cheu's existence. Reading the reviews and descriptions beforehand, I knew the noodles and food aren't authentic in origin but rather the creations of an excellent chef's culinary imagination. That chef happens to have cooked at one of the best restaurants (Matyson) in the city. Despite my general apprehension of Asian fusion cuisine, I ventured into Cheu's Noodle Bar fearlessly..fueled by my obsession of noodles. \n\nThe inside is really small. Exactly how a noodle bar should be like. There's about 3-4 tables besides the stools. Overall, clean and modern look and yet had a very nice cultural and down to earth feel about it. Great first impression as you walk into the place.\n\nWe ordered the following appetizers:\n\n*Black Garlic Wings w/ shishito peppers (4) $ 8: Great tasting garlic flavors on the outside. Had a nice crunch. Although lacked flavors inside. \n\n*Burger & Pork Belly Buns $7: The buns are fried briefly on the outside. The pork belly was absolutely delicious. It was tender and flavorful. Really melted in your mouth. Exactly how it should be. The bun itself wasn't anything special. \n\n*Eggplant w/ crispy garlic, herbs, tamarind  $7: I'm not a huge eggplant fan so I can't really comment. Maybe you are and will love this dish!\n\nWe ordered the following noodles:\n\nPORK BELLY RAMEN W/ POUCHED EGG, SEA BEANS, GREENS $12: \n\nTHE GOOD: Once again, the pork belly was really good. Definitely the standout of the entire experience. \n\nTHE BAD: The broth wasn't horrible. If you never have authentic ramen before, you might actually think it's delicious. My taste buds are spoiled from the likes of Ippudo and Totto. The broth lacked a certain richness and depth. \n\nTHE UGLY: The ramen was chewier and harder than I liked. Not used to eating ramen with this type of noodles. \n\nDUCK PHO w/ FOIE GRAS MEATBALLS $13: I don't really understand why this is called Pho because nothing about it taste like Pho. Instead of the traditional rice noodles, Cheu decided to use the exact ramen noodles for the duck \"pho\" as well...speechless. Aficionados of Pho will be offended. The meatballs were tasty. If you are a fan of pho...be warned! \n\nPrices are on the heavier side. Service was friendly and accommodating. \n\nUltimately- Come here with an open heart about how the food here is conceptionized and prepared and you'll love it more. Read this: Nothing about Cheu is traditional. I genuinely attempted my best to like the noodle bar but years of eating authentic ramen and pho ruined this experience for me.\n\nI wholeheartedly laud owners Ben and Shawn for coming up with this uber cool idea and having the courage to make it a reality. Wish them nothing but success! Will definitely come back one day to see how the food has evolved!",

  "text": "I rarely eat fast food because a: I like supporting local, and b: I prefer eating something that is more healthy.  But for Captain D's, I decided to step out of my boundaries and give them a try.\n\nI have lived on the south side for nearly 20 years and something about this place keeps it going despite the difficulty getting into the parking lot (more later).  It appears to be the only one of this chain in the metro area (according to the website locator).  Yet the ratings stay high while many other fast food places get poor ratings.  So, I stopped in for lunch.\n\nOkay, if you are heading southbound on the divided highway US 31, you can pull right into the lot which has a loop around the building for drive through service.  But even the lot has a large dip for drainage.  However, if you are heading here from the south, you need to turn onto the side street before reaching it and then take a right onto another side street that has sandbox sized potholes by the lot which you have to navigate around.  And getting out of here, you have to head south and turn at the stop light to get headed back to the north.  \n\nSo, I took the side street route to get here and found some parking, entering on the highway side.  The place has a clean dining room at the entrance with the order counter on the back left.  The menu is listed overhead and when you are ready, place your order.  I was surprised at how quickly my order came forward form the kitchen in the back.  I hadn't even finished paying yet (they don't make you sign your receipt here even though it says Merchant's Copy....I asked) when my tray arrived with Fish and Fries.\n\nI was given a cup for my beverage to fill at the station to the right.  I also stopped to get some sauces including ketchup and tartar sauce.  Unlike their nearest competitor in the industry, I didn't find malt vinegar anywhere.  I had also been given a wrapped plastic fork at the counter to use.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised that the fries were really long and still hot and had already been salted.  Very nice!  And the fish (2 pcs) were long and crisped though once cut, the breading sometimes fell off from the steam of the fish.  Again, the fish was good without any \"fishy\" scent.  That's a good sign!  The plate also came with a couple hush puppies.\n\nOverall, I would say that if you are a fan of this type of meal, the quality is as good as any fast food place I've been.  Now, if they could just do something about the parking lot.\n\nReview #3521",

It's been about 6 months since I've been to mcdougals and some things have changed. \n\n1. The large basket used to be $8.99, it's now $10.99. \n2. You can no longer get a cup of water. They now proudly offer you bottled water. Don't get any hot sauce! \n3. The fried chicken sandwich used to be $7.49, it's now $6.99. DEAL, right? Wrong, the sandwich now cost $6.99 but doesn't come with fries. You have to pay $3.09 to add fries. Want a drink with that too? That will be $2.19. \n\nSo the normal meal my boyfriend and I get used to cost about 19 dollars. The same meal now costs 25 dollars (2 dollars more for large basket and 3 bucks for the fries that are now an add on).\n\nWould I eat here again? Yea, but I'm not happy with all the new changes to the menu.",

After a block or two I call , low and behold, the pizza and steak place is in the laundromat. This is an ominous sign!\n\n\nBy phone I ordered two cheese steaks for $7 and it comes with French Fries. The order was taken with some difficulty as I had to repeat myself several times in order for the person on the other line to repeat the order as I had given it. On the call I was frustrated however when I arrived at the restaurant I realized she was doubling as the laundromat attendant and taking the orders on the phone for the pizzeria. Too funny. The restaurant as well as the laundromat is extremely clean. But it's new. Based on the location it'll probably change.  The cheesesteaks were extremely sparse lacking meat and cheese, the fries taste like precooked or warmed over fries. Not cold but reheated or under a lamp.

  "text": "Mediterranean food is really one of my favorite types of food. I didn't know it until recently, but it is. I was really craving some fresh pita bread and hummus and so I thought about it and decided to try a place nearby. My fiance and I showed up on a Saturday evening and we were both surprised that we were able to be seated so quickly! There were other customers inside, but it was not crazy busy. It was comfortable. \n\nOur server came over and took our drink orders she also made a few recommendations from the menu. We decided to try the red dip to start and then we continued to look over the menu.  To be honest, I was really thinking about ordering a gyro, but something told me not. I was in a new place and I needed to try a new thing. I surprised myself and ordered the chicken saganaki, the server told me that I would really enjoy it which only made me want it more. \n\nWe enjoyed our dip and the pita while waiting for our meals. By the time our meals came I was feeling ready to try a new dish. It looked delicious and smelled even better. I could not wait to try it. Before digging in though our server offered to bring us some refills which we needed and then she left us to enjoy our meals. One bite later and I was in love. I don't know what saganaki is, but now I know this is going to be my \"go to\" dish when I come here. The chicken was juicy and the flavors worked so well together. I even has some pita to dip in the sauce which was perfect. \n\nYes, I would say this is on my new list of favorite places in STL. If you like Mediterranean food or if you want to try an awesome Mediterranean place you should go visit Apollonia. The food was delicious and the service was friendly and quick.",

  "text": "I received a menu/flier in my mail, and wanted to give it a try. I called to place a carry out order, and my food was ready for pick up in about 15 minutes. The location itself is clean, modern and bright. There is plenty of seating inside. If you are dining in, you go to the counter to place your order, and then you are given a number, and they will bring your food out to you. When I arrived back home, my order was packaged nicely and food was hot a fresh. I sampled from family members the pan fried dumplings (they were ok, not so flavorful), Chicken Pad Thai (again, not flavorful), Japanese Fried Rice (once again, not flavorful), and I ordered the yellow Thai Curry. My dish by far was the best. Wasn't the best yellow curry that I've had in my life, but it was tasty. The third star in my rating is for this dish.\n\nOverall, I would be fine if I never ate here again. Since majority of the items that I tried were not full of flavor, I am not in a hurry to try anything else. Pricing was on the lower end, so I may sample other menu items in the future, for that reason only.",

The Jamba Juice is perfect for breakfast or just to pretend you are in Cali.\n\nHINT: Near their checkout lanes grab a couple tuperware containers full of prepared soups such as Split Pea, Clam Chowder and Parmesean Broccoli.

I somehow keep stopping too early for pizza. But this is a bakery... And a bakery that makes some really good cakes, cookies, tarts, and other items. They also make breakfast pockets that resemble huge pop tarts. The latest wine that I bought was a mushroom and cheese pocket. I've had several types of cookies, cakes, these little fudge brownie pops on a stick, and a huge serving of bread pudding. A quality business that is a good alternative to your everyday bakery.",

The deli, get this, doesn't pre-slice their meats.  It makes a difference.  Trust me.  That's how it's done.\n\nOh yes.  The cheeses: they have a great selection of those as well.  During the day, there are free samples of 2 different cheeses.  Without fail.  It's something I look forward to :P\n\nThey even have some Schnucks products that I haven't noticed elsewhere (I'll be on the lookout, though.)  Vacuum packed smoked poultry?  Where did that come from?  Of course, this being in the area it is, there's plenty of Kosher too.",

The server promptly greeted us and we didn't have to wait long for him to return with our beverages and to take our order. I got the Chicken Biryani and my boyfriend got the Chicken Vindaloo. I absolutely loved the biryani! It was so fragrant and flavorful - delicious and enticing in every way. We were both very happy with our dishes. I also ordered the rasmalai for dessert, which is a sweet dumpling in condensed milk with rose water. It was perfect. It was like a sweet little pillow in my mouth with just the right amount of sweetness. I want to learn how to make this and experiment more with rose water in dishes. Anyway, I look forward to coming here again...I'll make sure it's soon!",

  "text": "This place is such a cool concept. You get to eat and drink while watching small planes and helicopters fly in and out on the grounds around you. \n\nService- 2 stars\nFood- 4 stars\n\nFrom the beginning the service was borderline rude. They were a little bit busy so maybe they were stressed but more than one person had an attitude. Being our first time there we were a little confused and no one greeted us for a while, finally the hostess did and she was pretty nice. We were looking at the specials board while we were waiting and a girl got in front of us and started erasing them with out saying a word, it was weird and kind of rude. So we decided to wait at the bar. The bartender was not too friendly either. She seemed annoyed when we asked what vodkas they had, what wines, etc. My bloody mary was delicious though!\n\nThankfully we got seated pretty quickly. We even got a table outside! It was shaded though so it was a little chilly, but we got up to look at the planes and stand in the sun for a little which was nice. I know we had drinks from the bar but the waiter I guess assumed we didn't need anything else and I was dying for water. He seemed busy as well. Eventually he took care of everything. The next drink I ordered was a mojito. It is on the drink menu however they couldn't make me one because they didn't have any mint. bummer. You can't substitute a salad for the fries, so I just got a salad as well. I'm convinced they accidentally gave me feta instead of goat cheese. Food took a very long time to come out. Again, busy I guess. But it was close to 45 minutes for mostly sandwiches.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the place. Watching the planes is cool, you can even take a helicopter ride! I think I would give it another chance if I was in the area again.",

  "text": "Szechwan Garden has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat in Indy. With a menu so big it requires page numbers, everyone can find something to eat here with little problem. Feeling adventurous? Try the frog dry pot or one of the dishes with intestine in them. Not feeling that? No worries... they have more of the typical Chinese food fare like Kung Pao Chicken, Fried Rice, Lo Mein, etc. too. There's something for everyone on the menu here.\n\nI've been here several times and have experimented a little bit with the menu, but I always get the crispy green beans and fried pot stickers. For my main dishes, I rotate between the Spicy Popcorn Chicken (which is addicting) and I've really started to get into the dry pots - a pan of food over hat that continues to bubble away at the table while you eat. I've had both the tofu and the chicken dry pots and both are delicious with lemongrass and ginger mixed into the broth.\n\nIf you haven't been here before, I offer some \"newbie\" tips to keep in mind:\n-If you're a wine snob and only drink specific varieties, stick with water here. They have two kinds of wine: Red and White. That's right.. it's a $9 glass of wine called \"Red\" or \"White\" and my guess is that's it's of the boxed variety.\n\n-Everything that I've gotten here has been big enough to share. Most of the tables have a lazy susan built into the middle of it to assist in the family style atmosphere. Just don't forget and place your water on it unless you plan on sharing that too! \n\n-Because things are meant to be shared, the food comes out when the dish is ready, not when everything is ready. \n\n-When it's time to start loading up leftovers (which there will almost always be), ask for the plastic containers if you have something soupy or full of liquid.",

I, on the other hand, ran into this location to get a sandwich to-go (after picking up some items at the Kroger next door), so I missed out on the whole 'Freaky Fast Sandwiches' experience.\n\nAnd not just because I didn't have it delivered -- my sandwich took forever for them to make even though I was the only person in the restaurant and was sitting right in front of the pick-up window.   There were 2 guys making sandwiches and 1 finally noticed me and said \"Oh, are you still waiting for your sandwich?\"    Why YES!\n\nEventually I got my sandwich and took it home to eat.   I got the #17 which they call The Ultimate Porker (smoked ham and bacon).   It was just 'meh'.    Honestly, I could make a better sandwich at home from the Kroger-brand deli meat.   And the bread?   I thought they were supposed to have this amazing bread for which they proudly offer 'Free Smells'.   Double-meh.   It was cold, hard, and tasteless.\n\nWell, at least I satisfied my curiosity regarding Jimmy John's for the next 10 years at least.",

  "text": "I don't know maybe I have gotten too used to Indo-Pak versions of this cuisine but everything here was really bland and mild. We ordered the \"sloppy joes\" off the appetizer menu and it was really just to sliders buns with minced chicken meat - we added the sauces brought to the table. The meat was spiced ok but was dried out and over cooked. The desserts are over-thought and thus fail to impress. Rasmalai are awesome on their own, please don't turn it into some mockery if a tiramisu. The orange rice pudding was ok but nothing special. The service was terrible and not just for us. This was I think due in large part to the waiters except on being either A. completely new and untrained or B. just really doesn't care.\nIn the case of our waitress she was clearly untrained. We cringed when she was struggling to explain the food to another table. Now we could hear the whole conversation because this place is rather small so it stands to reason the other two servers heard her struggling as well but opted to just stand by the cash register and stare off into space instead of trying to help her out. I know wait staff works for tips but the best restaurants and kitchens need teamwork and this place clearly did not have it. For the price point and the lack luster food this is most like the only time I will bother dining here.",

As is, I wish i got up earlier the other day for lunch instead of waiting till 12.30p to venture there. I completely underestimated the place because it was fairly empty @ 12.15p the day before...*sigh*\n\nChargrilled Oysters- I got half a dozen but wish I had  gotten the order of a Dozen. Parmesean, garlic and butter + baked oysters = Yummy. It wasn't too overpowering with the embellishments, which was A-OK with me since I usually like shellfish simply prepared- the best way to taste Fresh seafood.\n\nWarm Whiskey Bread Pudding- a small order for $4.99. It was so yummy that I really wished that the portion was BIGGER. It was SO good\n\nPeacemaker Po Boy- I got it to go, which was pretty good, but I'm sure it'd have been so much better if i'd had it HOT. Plenty of oysters and shrimps; it was definitely worth the $12 (+$1 when u order it to go)\n\nSeafood Gumbo- I've had better (@ Blues City Diner in Memphis), but it was probably the tastiest Gumbo I had in NOLA ( i had it at several places)\n\nI'll definitely be back on my (hopefully very soon) next visit",

We were then directed to sit in any available seating in the three dining dining rooms. The food came fairly quickly and consisted of grits, meat,eggs (which you could have fried, scrambled,.etc.), and a homemade biscuit. The ham was the star of the show: flavorful, moist with a great taste. The sausage was okay and not greasy. The biscuits was huge enough to share and was accompanied by blackberry jam.

I have never actually set foot inside this place but I have had many deliveries from this location. I've been satisfied every time with how courteous their drivers are, how quickly they deliver the food, and how tasty their subs are. I always get almost the same thing every time: a turkey tom with extra turkey, add in some onions and peppers. Sometimes I get it on the regular French bread, other with their whole wheat bread.\n\nI love the consistency of this place with their delivery service as well as the food and the online ordering makes everything very convenient!",

  "text": "Publix has been my go-to grocery store ever since I moved to Florida many years ago. Yeah it can be more expensive than those super-discount chains, but I'll gladly pay the extra money for a very clean store with friendly & helpful associates and a terrific selection of items.\n\nWhen I was married and used to live in Westchase this was one of the two Publix that I used to visit regularly. She-who-must-never-be-named and I would make our regular pilgrimages to Publix to load up on the staple items for the pantry and freezer, and then stop in during the week for fresh fruits, veggies, and dinner ideas.\n\nThis particular Publix is located along Race Track Road and Hillsborough Avenue extended, right before you cross the magical line into Pinellas County. The shopping center is across Race Track from the Oldsmar Flea Market, and it contains a big Lowe's, YouFit Health Club, Cracker Barrel, Publix, and some other retail outlets.\n\nWe would either stop at the smaller Publix on Linebaugh Avenue and Countryway Boulevard in the heart of Westchase (better known as the \"little\" Publix), or this one on Race Track Road known as the \"bigger\" Publix. Truth be told, this particular Publix is a medium-sized store within their chain (as compared to the big one on Gunn Highway across from Sickles High School).\n\nWhat I like about this store is that the associates will go out of their way to help you find particular items - even if they are clear across the store. The associates were happy to lead you over to the correct aisle, and then look through the selection of products until you find what you need. They don't view this as an annoyance, but rather as an opportunity to say 'Thanks for shopping here, how can I help you?'.\n\nI've had great experiences at the butcher case, and enjoyed some terrific conversations with the people who will break down one of their packaged items to give you what you need, or even carve it fresh off of a larger cut of meat. One of the butchers would regularly stop and chat with me, and provide cooking tips as he was carving up some special steaks. I was always very appreciative for their excellence in customer service.\n\nNow that I live over in Carrollwood I visit a different set of Publix grocery stores for my regular shopping, but still stop into this store whenever I'm in the Oldsmar / Westchase area and need to pick up a few items.",

There's also a very sweet, friendly lady (I think her name is Lisa?) who works the drive through register, and she's a joy to see in the morning-- very warm and friendly.

This 9 dolla sandwich comes with a side of hand-cut fries, and I have to say, I've never had any luck with them.

  "text": "Welcome Back Gino's! Had my first Gino's burger in over 20 years...very tasty, but to be perfectly honest I can't exactly remember what they tasted like back in the day... \n\nHad the Bacon Cheeseburger, fries, and a strawberry chocolate shake for about 13 bucks...the price is whats keeping them from 5 stars, just a bit high for fast food. \n\nThe fries are fresh cut, so they are thicker fries...i like mine thinner and crispier, but they are OK. The shake is a shake very similar to McDonald's or Burger King, I don't know there is any real ice cream or milk in it, but it's cold and creamy and is only 3 bucks... \n\nThe burger was good for sure, I will be having another. But its not something like Cheeburger Cheeburger or Charlie's Burgers in Ridley that I would drive 30 minutes for without thinking twice. Still, its nice to have another option available and I do suggest you check it out. \n\nObviously, this is a brand spanking new franchise...the staff has very little experience and there are bound to be issues while they are getting their feet wet in the burger business. Someone complained about the soda machines being out of order or the inexperience of the staff. Unfortunately, experience isn't something you can get training for, so this is bound to happen, particularly in the first week of opening...If you can't deal with the learning curve I'd give them a couple weeks to get their act together,(goes for any restaurant) but i had no issues whatsoever going during a busy lunch hour and was very pleased with the food and the service. Only the high prices kept them from 5 stars... \n\nSo be patient, eventually someone will learn how to refill the soda machine promptly and will do it with a smile on their face. \n\nGino's parking lot is a bit odd, the entrance and exit are both in the same location...makes more sense to have separate entrances and exits, but i guess they didn't have the option...kids have to be careful going in and out of the building as there isn't much of sidewalk...also note: no drive thru...",

The wait was terribly long at 6:30 on a Thursday night. The parking was quite tough as we had to park in the Wegman's parking lot then run across the street. But as for the restaurant itself, if you get a salad, you're probably getting something healthy, decently good, and reliable.",

  "text": "The staff here really know how to represent the brand. I arrived early at 8:45 am a little before they opened. The store clerk saw me waiting and opened early at 8:50am. This was impressive to me as most associates would wait to exactly 9am and open at 9:01am. To me it's better when an establishment opens early rather than late. Glad to see that they prioritize promptness and customer service. After walking in the store I was immediately welcomed and went to the area with the items I was looking for. The store is well organized and the handbag section is color coordinated. In most ROSS stores, it's difficult to find what you need as you shuffle through the piles of inventory without any idea of what you'll find. The store was bright and clean and impressively the store clerk checked me out immediately after I approached the cashier area. Love this location and the selection they offer, will definitely be back again when I'm in the area.",

Having been there before we just parked the car and began walking around and came upon the Farnsworth House.\n\nI must say we were pleasantly surprised at he extensive menu, with specials, as well as the 21 beers on tap.\n\nCarol had the Chicken Barcelona along with a salad (Gorgonzola dressing - excellent) which was crisp and fresh. The chicken was stuffed with a spicy sausage and dill mixture and served with a Dijon mustard & tomato cream sauce. A serving of whole grilled asparagus finished off the plate.\n\nI tried the Chicken Bella Bucca with a similar salad. My chicken was stuffed with prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, served over sauteed spinach in a Madeira wine sauce. Carol had a glass of red wine while I tried a Dogfish Head Palo Santo and followed that with a Green Flash IPA.\n\nAll, in all, a wonderful meal with a very attentive waiter.

  "text": "Wow was this place overrated. With a 4.5 average and almost 500 reviews I expected something spectacular. What I got was an average burger patty with communion wafer of a flatbread bun. The bun was dry and cracked at the fold. I did like the flavor, but the texture completely ruined the bun for me. The meat itself a small patty cooked well but underseasoned. The veggies on the burger were suspect in freshness. I had ordered the cheddar cheeseburger. My two dining companions ordered the bacon cheeseburger and the Texas bbq burger. The Texas bbq guy said it was mediocre. The bacon cheeseburger guy said it was about the same as Carl's Jr. He might have been exaggerating.\n\nThe sauces were average at best, especially with all the hole in the wall burger joints that dominate the foodie scene. My dining companion did not care for the viscosity of the sauces, as they were too runny. I did not think the flavors were bold enough. \n\nThe seasoning on the fries was pretty good, but the texture reminded me of kfc potato wedges.\n\nService was irritating. The cashier did not greet us but instead carried on a long conversation with other employees. The service when we received the food was better but not enough to make me forget the cashier.\n\nBathroom smelled like mildew and also like urine. \n\nNot worth a drive out of the way especially with so many other choices.",

  "text": "I've always felt that Cafe De Thai was ahead of it's time.   From the prices I just couldn't afford when I was younger and less interested in a higher end unique experience.   To the modern building with it's oddly satisfying angles and excellent use of natural light beaming onto the industrial surfaces on the interior.  Cafe De Thai has always seemed like someone \"transported\" it right out of the not so distant future.  But not anymore.  The future is here, and it's much more homey than I expected it to be.  Contrasting the coolness of the metal and concrete lines is a family owned warmth to the service.\n\nEvery time I have been we have received the friendliest and most welcoming service.  Our names were remembered just the second time we returned to dine.  We've gone mostly at lunch and at off times to avoid the busier periods.  The food has been good and unique.  My favorite dish by far has been the pho.  For the broth alone it's worth coming here.  Check out my photos of the Pho.  They will tell you all you need to know about that dish.  The meats are all very traditional. Beef balls and such, but the star is the broth.\n\nOne of the other things I have loved about Cafe is their unique drink creations that give them their own signature.  Many times alcohol will just be a nice addition to the offerings.  Here they step up the creative game and give you something different to experience off the menu every once in awhile.\n\nNow to get back in for dinner some time soon...",

  "text": "It is unusual I am even writing this review, as normally I steer clear of donuts and the like. It's not that I do not like them.., I just do not love them enough to eat them. \n\nThe request for a donut definitely did not come from me, but when my hubby asked me to find him some it became obvious that Long's was the place to be in Indy. Via Yelp we were warned about long lines out the door but we were skeptical. Lines? For a donut? On a Sunday?\n\nNo fail and no kidding when we arrived line was out the door, and mind you this was a chilly morning in March. The kind of morning where it is too damn cold to be outside, let alone be outside to wait for anything in line. Luckily, the line seems to move quickly but when you reach the warm inside of the bakery you get hit with a surprise. A snaking line reminiscent of Cedar Point roller coaster queues will have you stand around wondering what even possessed you to come here in the first place. \n\nOn the brightside, if you are the least bit organized you will be ready to go and know exactly what you want when it comes time to place your order. If you are unlucky you will stand in line behind someone like me who gets instantly bugeyed and gummy brained at the idea of ordering anything. \n\nWe opted for a good mix of different types of donuts.. you know, for research purposes. Maple dipped cake, caramel nut yeast, chocolate dipped yeast, powdered yeast, chocolate cake and cinnamon twists were snuggling together in the box amongst a few others which I cannot recall. \n\nThe best by far is the chocolate dipped yeast donut. Light and fluffy with a GREAT chocolate glaze. The glaze is not overly sweet, and contrary to most chocolate dipped donuts out there it has a deep chocolate flavor. So, so good! Another favorite was the caramel nut yeast donut. A gooey and sweet caramel glaze with chopped peanuts gave a wonderful texture to the donut.\n\nI was a little apprehensive about the cinnamon twist as I was not sure what to expect. Cinnamon flavored items are hit or miss for me, as most of the time the cinnamon tastes artificial to me. This however was a great donut/pastry. What made it stand out was the type of sugar used in the coating, it is slightly coarser and therefore creates a good crunch on the outside. \n\nI will absolutely order the chocolate dipped yeast donuts again, as well as a close second favorite which were the caramel nut yeast donuts. I am not a big fan of their cake donuts, the batter is too bland for my taste and the consistency seems slightly off from your typical cake donut. They are almost too 'light' and not quite cakey enough in my opinion. \n\nWhat is really, really odd and confusing is the pricing structure at Long's. Dipped donuts are priced differently than non-dipped, cake donut prices vary also from eachother as well as from yeast donuts. Ordering a true mixed dozen becomes a matter of them ringing up each donut seperately which seems way too complicated. But who am I?\n\nEither way, kudos to Long's! Any business longs (see what I did there!?) for a dedicated following, and judging by the lines, Yelp reviews and the fact that they operate out of two bakeries I think they have accomplished just that.\n\n[CASH ONLY]",

This was like a typical Chipotle establishment.  The only difference would be that the line was located to the left side of the room.  Which was not typical for me.  Everything looks the same as any Chipotle except the line.\n\nWhen it was my turn to order, they told me they didnt have chicken.  They asked if I could wait or change my order.  They said I would be waiting for 15 minutes.  I decided to wait because I didnt feel like eating beef at the time.  So I WAITED.\n\nThey were right.  It was done in 15 minutes. They even serviced me first once the chicken was done.  The only thing that bothered me was that before they told me when the chicken wasnt ready, they already added beans, rice in the tortilla for my burrito.  WHICH is the result when chicken was done...they still used the same tortilla with the beans and rice.  My Tortilla ended up soggy.  Bad bad bad!\n\nOh well.  Sucks for me right?",

The trips, though fun, can be exhausting, so over time I've found efficiencies in the way I move through my weekend-long debauches.\n\nOne such convenience is a stop at Butcher, the Donald Link-owned lunch counter-cum-charcuterie next door to his restaurant, Cochon. \n\nAt the end of a trip, I drop my rental at Hertz, then walk two blocks to Butcher, where I buy something for the plane and something for the house. Thence to Harrah's hotel, the airport and home.\n\n\"Something for the plane\" has included such delicacies as: \n\n- Le Pig Mac, which is delicious, and is, as the menu says: \"2 all Pork Patties, Special Sauce, Lettuce, Cheese, Pickle, Onion on Sesame Bun\"\n- Pork Belly with Mint and Cucumber on White, a misleadingly straightforward description of a solid pseudo-souvlaki\n- Duck Pastrami Sliders, which I think about when I'm on the plane, flying TO New Orleans.\n\nPeople complain sometimes that these sandwiches are small. I'll grant that they're not foods built to serve gluttony. Butcher's lunch offerings serve a higher purpose - evocation - and should be savored with calm appreciation. If that requires more patience than the diner can muster, he's well-advised to buy two.\n\n\"Something for the house\" is often whole breasts of Duck Pastrami. Butcher's team applies a brown sugar and salt brine to the duck, letting it brine for a week, before drying and smoking it at 140 degrees. After the smoke, the breasts hang for 10 days to let them dry.* \n\nDescribing the result is a challenge. \"Rich, but not too rich.\" \"Touched with salt, but not distractingly so.\" \"Smoked, but not smoky.\" \"Succulent, if juiceless meat can be called that.\" \n\nPerhaps the better way to relate the characteristics of Butcher's Duck Pastrami is to say how I've used it:\n\nI brought two breasts home with me just before Thanksgiving. It was my turn to prepare appetizers for the big meal, so I barbecued oysters over a hickory fire, topping them with parmesan, butter, lemon, parsley, garlic and translucent shavings of Butcher's Duck Pastrami.\n\nThe next morning, having duck left in the fridge, I whipped up a Hollandaise and served our houseguests Duck Pastrami Eggs Benedict. \n\nAnd finally, on Sunday morning, I diced the remaining duck with Yukon Golds, Red Garnet Yams and a few bits of fried leek (thanks, Tractor Room...) and voila! Duck Hash.\n\nI won't say that Butcher's Duck Pastrami has made me a better cook, but having such a special resource available compels me to think through my plan, so as to do the Butcher team justice.\n\n******************************\nCochon:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/cochon-new-orleans\nHertz:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/hertz-rent-a-car-new-orleans\nHarrah's Hotel:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/harrahs-new-orleans-new-orleans-2?hrid=F6V0HC-HWVzkkbWG3wAimw\nTractor Room:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-tractor-room-san-diego?hrid=0u4Z6dF8UcMB4RxJu4TF6A\n\n******************************\n* http://www.eater.com/2014/7/7/6202345/the-charcuterie-board-at-cochon-butcher-in-nola",

Note that you do order at the counter where you pick up your order from another part of the counter too.\n\nI ordered the cappuccino, the green tea waffle, and the mushroom sandwich. The cappuccino was decent (maybe a little bit too watered down) but with the waffle was definitely a great pairing.\n\nI would not recommend getting their sandwiches..it's not worth your money. It's pricey and doesn't taste especially good..if you're looking for convenience, sure. \n\nOverall, Cafe Benne is a good place to get some work done and enjoy a simple cup of coffee. I actually came to catch up with a friend so of course that works too!",

It seems that you can't live too far north of Market or too west of Broad for them to include you in their radius.\n\nEverything I've had here satisfies on a level comparable to that of other Indian places in town.  While the chicken tikka masala is a little bit more boring than other places(other places will throw in a lot more onions, peppers, sliced tomatoes etc. in the dish), it still did its job(which was to satisfy me and then make me want to take a nap for 2 hours).\n\nThe vegetable samosas are not the best, but they are counteracted by a very tasty veggie tandoor dish.  The navratan korma is pretty darn good and will satisfy the vegetarian within you(or physically apart from you).  \n\nThis review would have been 3 stars but the great delivery radius bumped them up a notch.",

  "text": "I was driving in the Upper Darby area last week and I came across a small restaurant with a big sign saying \"The Falafelhouse\". Falafel Is one of my favorite foods and I just had to stop and try this spot out.\nThere are many different ways of making Falafel,  and this was the most unique way I've ever tried.  Every country or region prepare the Falafel sandwich different and The Falafelhouse's version had all of the traditional ingredients with a twist. The Falafel was freshly made in front of me, fried, smashed on a flour tortilla wrap, then she added fresh veggies,  sauce and spices.  She then rolled it up just like a burrito. The cook said it was the way they made it in the region or Lebanon from where she was born.\nIt was delicious but I tasted a flavor I had never experienced in any other Falafel sandwich before,  but I just couldn't put my finger on it.  I asked the young lady about the spice that I was tasting and she couldn't tell me anything, apparently the Chef made all the ingredients and she just put them together. If I was going to guess what it was, I think it was cinnamon. \n To sum it up the food was good the service was okay ( hey family operation where children were the servers), but the only bad thing was that the place was not as clean as I would like it. So the kid that spend all his time on the laptop computer needed To be sentenced to some serious KP duties.",

The Dale Mabry location is slightly more convenient, but the crowded parking lot if very frustrating to me.\n\nI love Publix. It is a premier grocery store. I laugh to think about how much Publix stands apart from the Kroger chains I am used to from growing up in Michigan. The best part is that not only does Publix have a great selection of groceries, they also have the best subs around!",

The farm to table concept is great and the healthy 500 calorie or less meals are good for the waistline.  The beer selection is lacking but not terrible.  This restaurant is focused on wine so I didn't expect them to have a diverse selection.\n\nOur server was attentive and knew the menu well.  After taking our drink orders we ordered the Harvest & Spicy Sausage Flat Breads and the Mussels.  In addition to these apps I ordered a small salad.\n\nOur appetizers & my salad came out quickly.  The Flat Bread's were much larger then I thought they would be and we enjoyed both of them.  Although my salad was simple it was the perfect size and I really enjoyed the dressing.\n\nFor dinner we had the fish special and short rib entree's.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The portions are small but they need to be to stay under 500 calories.  Since we were not full from dinner some of us tried their dessert cups.  I thought there were a nice finish to the meal and they were only $3-$4 each.\n\nAlthough the food was good for $100 a couple I left very underwhelmed.  I don't mind spending money on food but it needs to live up to the price.  There are so many good restaurants around these days you can get good food anywhere.  The food needs to be great to stand out and Harvest didn't do that for me.",

  "text": "I don't need to think twice about giving Banh Mi So #1 five stars. I haven't been this sure about anything in a long time.\n\nPicture this: After a long trip out of town, I got back to the STL around 9:30pm on a weekday and was starving. No food in the house, grocery store not something I wanted to do, and every place I knew of had already stopped serving food. I scoured my Yelp app and found BMS and called them up to ask them if it was too late to place a to-go order - by this time it was 9:40ish. The kind man who answered the phone told me they actually closed at 9pm but depending on what I wanted, they might be able to make it for me because they still had people there. I read him off what my friend and I were wanting, and he said \"okay. Be here in twenty minutes.\" Can do!\n\nThis place was waaaay farther down Grand than I thought it would be. For some reason I pictured it in the middle of all the international places on Grand (Mochi, King & I, Pho Grand, etc.) It was definitely a good two miles or so past there and I felt a little uncomfortable in unfamiliar territory, but that's okay. Parked right outside (literally no one was around) and walked in to a really sweet man waiting there with my food! He was totally relaxed about it and said it was no big deal that they made me the food after hours. So nice and way above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nQuick breakdown of what we ate:\nSpring rolls: the sign outside said they were the best in town, and while I don't agree with that, they were very good (just not stuffed the way I like... I was also missing some cilantro.)\nBun Ga Xao (sauteed chicken & onion over vermicelli): tangy and satisfying. Pour that orange sauce they give you all over it. The texture in this one is dynamite. Crunchy, but the noodles underneath are smooth.\nCom Chay (vegetarian rice plate): tons of tofu, tons of curry... this one was my favorite.\n\nI cannot WAIT to order more from this place! It's certainly not cheap, but it doesn't break the bank either. Consider Banh Mi So for carryout or dining in when you have the craving for Vietnamese. They're obviously willing to go out of their way for their customers!",

While I was happy they accommodated my friend, it left me puzzled as to why we were told from the beginning we could not order our meat medium well from the beginning. That encounter left me wondering what the heck was going on. \n\nDessert had to be tried for it was her birthday.
