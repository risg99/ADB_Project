I watched the fountain show while eating my burger.  But you can't miss the shakes, the shakes are delicous.  I definently recommend this restaurant to anyone that is at the Gaylord Opryland resort in Nashvile, Tennessee.",

Oh and this place has Matcha Green Tea and they know how to properly prepare a straight cup of matcha. A true blessing for matcha lovers.",

It's pretty much what you'd expect. Comparable to Long's. I might say that it's slightly BETTER (gasp!!!) because they seem to have a little more variety but it's not a pissing match.",

  "text": "They have two different menus for you to order from. One is chinese/ Japanese American styled restaurant and one is authentic Chinese food. The regular menu is the same as other restaurant, nothing special about it. The ramen is delicious and I would recommend the black garlic broth with BBQ pork. The egg drop soup is kind of plain and my first take out order egg drop soup actually tasted lightly sour like it's about to go bad. The wonton soup is plain too, but you can tell the wonton are made fresh, not the frozen kind from take out chinese restaurant. The authentic chinese menu are  very good. I like their garlic stirred fried veggies. I can say these menu items are not full of MSG, but lot of spice and soy sauce, sesame oil to make the flavor come out.",

  "text": "I visited this place for the first time tonight with two other couples. I did not particularly like having to pay $5.00 to \"valet\" park my car 20 feet from me. I was stopped when I arrived and told the price. I asked if I could park myself and was told \"no, no one parks themselves.\" I'm perfectly capable of parking my own car AND it cost me $5.00 to park it very close to where I was stopped. I don't agree with that. There's no need for forced valet parking. \n\nTo get to the positive-we were greeted by a friendly young lady when we arrived. We were seated quickly but we did have a reservation. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food dishes ordered at my table ranged from the burger to rabbit fettuccine, fried chicken, stew and meatloaf. Everyone said their meal was delicious. I would return for dinner other than the valet issue which may have me think twice.",

  "text": "Visited Voodoo Gumbo during our visit to Nashville since my husband loves Cajun cuisine which is not readily available in our area.  Drove about 1/2 hr from our hotel to the restaurant which was in a strip mall with TJ Maxx.  Since it was 3:00 in the afternoon the restaurant was empty.  We were instructed to order at the register, the food was freshly cooked &  brought to our table.  My husband had the seafood gumbo (his favorite) which he loved.  He also had the shrimp po'boy & I had the oyster po'boy with coleslaw.\nThere were so many oysters I had to eat 1/2 of them first in order to pick up the sandwich.  Both po'boys were excellent, crispy & \"melted in your mouth\" tender. The po'boys were filling but we had to have the beignets which were hot & delicious. We inquired if there was a Voodoo Gumbo up north but was told by William it was privately owned.   Hi to Joyce & DeAnna who were also friendly & welcoming! We will definitely come back our next visit to Nashville.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I went here based on a suggestion from a friend that used to live in New Orleans.  He claimed that the Po'Boys here are authentic.  Seeing as how I don't know what an authentic Po'Boy is supposed to taste like, I cannot compare.  That being said, I can rate the place based on its own merit of flavor.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice sit down place, this is not it.\nIf you are looking for a place to take a date, this is not it.\nIf you are looking for a quick light bite to eat, this is not it.\n\nIf you are looking for a flavor explosion in your mouth that can satisfy an army, you've come to the right place.\n\nThe decor is very dingy so don't expect anything high class here.  The food portions are not only large...but unlimited! (I'll get to this in a minute) The food quality is superb and the variety of things you get is excellent.\n\nIn a nutshell, how this place works is you go in and order a Po'Boy, there are only about 4 different options such as chicken and catfish.  Once you sit down, you get visited by someone from the staff that takes your order for Sides.  I do not recall how many sides there were, but it was around 10.  These sides are unlimited, once you finish you side, you can request more or try something new on the list.  While waiting for the Po'Boy to arrive we had some sides and were already starting to get full on those alone.  Here comes the Po'Boy...a sandwich big enough that the two of us could have shared.  MAN was it yummy.  We gorged ourselves on the food here to the point that the drive home felt very guilty :)\n\nI recommend coming here with an appetite and maybe a few friends.  \n\nGreat job papa Roux!",

It's a great place to pick up hairdye and knick knacks.\n\nThey offer a membership for 5 dollars that you will get much more in return. You get a membership pricing on certain items and some gifts on certain occasions when you spend a certain amount.\n\nThey have a website too for what you can not find in stores. The workers are usually helpful the times I went. The last time the girl offered assistance on picking up colors for my mom and I. I felt she was off on my mom's color a bit, but nothing I couldn't fix up.\n\nI love picking up haircare products from here, but do be careful. I feel some of the products might be a little too old. I had gone to Cali and picked up a bottle of styling product but left it in Cali when I left. So I went to the Sally's back home and picked up the same bottle but the product wasn't clear like the other one. It turned out to be a really nasty yellow color. I wasn't sure if the product was bad or if that's how it was suppose to be.\n\nSo I'm going to be a little more cautious picking up some of their generic brands. I do however love picking up their deep conditioning packets that are almost always on sale for .99cents. Great for if you're always dying your hair!\n\nThey have tons of products for your nails, hair to do extensions, accessories for hair, and appliances. You might get a good deal here than you would other places on appliances. So it doesn't hurt to check in to see if you can pick up something here than running to the nearest Utla.",

  "text": "This restaurant was a huge disappointment for me.  I was in the city for one night on business and picked 3 restaurants - couldn't find the other 2 and this was my 3rd choice.  I will not be going back on a future trip.  \n\nThe restaurant was empty, except for one large party.  The staff at the door were friendly and helpful, however one of the kitchen staff actually challenged me about a food allergy after I made a special request.  The server talked a lot about their 'specialties' - which were 'sustainable fish' (in conversation later, I figured out that he didn't even know what sustainable meant), homemade items, and fresh ingredients.  I didn't experience any of the above.\n\nI wasn't sure what to order (the menu does look enticing - with many choices), so I ordered a cup of italian wedding soup while I thought about my meal.  It was the WORST soup I have ever had.  It is NOT italian wedding soup.  The ingredients are prepared separately and then thrown together when ordered.  The broth is like a brine - I only had a few sips and I swelled up the next day.  There were no beans, only flavorless meatballs and uncooked spinach floating in the brine.  I finally decided on a pizza because they insisted seafood was their specialty and I love shrimp on a pizza.  So I asked for the 5 cheese pizza, which is described as a white pie with 5 different cheeses (no tomato sauce).  I asked them to leave off the gorgonzola and add on shrimp.  They got the shrimp right...that was about it.  I basically got a cheese pizza....tomato sauce and all.  All the cheeses are mixed together so you cannot appreciate the flavors of the different cheeses.  As I was taking my pizza in a box to go, I asked the server \"you're sure this doesn't have tomato sauce, right\" and he says \"of course - our 5 cheese pizza never has tomato sauce\".  Wish I had opened the box right there and saved myself the trouble of throwing it away in my hotel room.  Finally, I'll mention my flat sparkling water.  While I waited on my pizza I sat at the bar and had a glass of 'sparkling' water.  Don't order Pellegrino here - they don't even know what it is.  When I asked for a glass, they offered me the wine list.  LOL.  So then I asked for sparkling water and got a very old bottle of not-so-bubbly water.  And when the server asked me if I wanted to take the rest with me, I told him 'no thanks, it was flat anyway' and he didn't offer to do anything about it.  The only reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that the bread was amazing.  But I highly doubt it's made in house!",

  "text": "This pharmacy is continually one of the worst I have ever been to in my life. I am now looking into how to report this pharmacy or escalate this to a higher authority. I am seriously doing my research on this because the staff at this Walgreens are the worst staff I have ever seen ANYWHERE. They all lack customer service skills or general skills for interacting with other human beings. I have only come here twice in my life and have had a horrific experience at this particular Walgreens not once but BOTH times I have ever been here. The pharmacist \"Fred\" is rude and disgusting and needs to be fired. He does not deserve to work here. He is the worst pharmacist I have ever come across and I'm quite surprised that he was even able to become a pharmacist with his atrocious treatment of customers. I came here because my normal Walgreens pharmacy is closed at this time (10:00 PM) and I needed a refill of a single-dose medication that my doctor told me I could have two of. I got the initial dose yesterday afternoon. I came back for the second dose tonight because the symptoms had been continually concerning. I was told by \"Fred\" the pharmacist that I have to wait 20 minutes for the medication. I came back around after more than 20 minutes and he looked at me like he had never seen me before and asked how he could help me. I stated that I had been here over 20 minutes ago and he said \"oh, right, I didn't even start working on it yet.\" He then takes all of my information all over again as if this is his first time seeing me. He looks into getting me the medication and comes back and tells me that I am not able to get it today because I have to wait 24 hours from the last time I got the medication to be able to get it again. I explained to him that I had gotten it over 24 hours ago (around 3:00 PM yesterday and it is now 10:30 PM). He said \"I don't mean to argue with you but...\" and the rest was nonsense. I literally got the medication over 24 hours ago and met the guidelines to have the prescription filled again and was told I could not get it. He told me to come back tomorrow morning. He wasted my time and when I mentioned this he did not seem apologetic about it. I called the pharmacy a little while after I got home to see how I could go about taking action, and when he picked up the phone, without even hearing me say a word, he said \"there are too many people here\" and put me on hold! Wow, this guy is among the trashiest of employees I have ever seen! I will definitely be looking into another 24/7 pharmacy because of my odd work hours, but in the meantime I will also be spreading the word to others not to go to this pharmacy and finding out how I can report these horrible pharmacy employees.",

The only sauce I think is above average is the newer buffalo sauce with a bit of sweetness. The sauce name escapes me. Half of my visits the wings were a little over cooked. The dining area has a cafeteria wanting to be a sports bar feel. I stopped in last March to watch a little of the NCAA tourney and they didn't even have it on their TVs.  \n\n2 stars for flavor. 2 stars for the dining room. 2 stars for value.\n\nUpdate: I have to bump this review up by 1 star. I stopped in for lunch yesterday because I was craving wings. I ate the honey buffalo wings again. This sauce is the one St Louis Wing Co desperately needed. A sauce that keeps you coming back for more. A balanced sauce with sweet, spicy, without too much acidity. Excellent sauce. \nI also had the rally squirrel sauce. I was very impressed. Carmel sauce and nuts on a chicken wing?  It works beautifully. Not too sweet Carmel sauce goes great with the crunchy exterior of the wings with a bit of saltiness. Well done.",

I was always given at least 24 hour notice if Sheila or a worker was going to show up on my property, usually to assess whether the property needed routine maintenance. \n\nSheila knew I was always busy with school and didn't have the time or energy to keep up with the weeds that would grow in my yard after the monsoons, so she would periodically have a worker come pull my weeds for me (yes, I was always notified and grateful!). My refrigerator broke one summer, and I had a brand new sparkling (and bigger!) fridge within 24 hours! \n\nIt's very difficult to believe anyone would say such bad things about Sheila and Cy. I know many of their tenants like to move within the various homes that they own, so they can keep having awesome landlords. Living in Tucson and especially as a grad student, good landlords and great property are difficult to find. Sheila and Cy are a gem in the renter's market. I miss them and their wonderful property I rented for 3 years. Truly great memories. If I'm ever back in Tucson, Sheila will be first person I call to ask for an available home.",

The key to having a good time here is to go during non-peak hours.\n\nService in the sit-down eating area - hit or miss, leaning towards hit.  Sometimes we get friendly, attentive service.  Other times, deplorable.  It all depends on the server and how busy the place is.  Food is solid.  I especially like the nachos.\n\nThey have good pool tables.  Again, service around the pool tables is hit or miss.  Pricing for pool table use is acceptable during non-peak hours.  \n\nArcade area and bowling area are standard D&B style.  There's sometimes a really long wait for bowling.  But there's enough other stuff to do in the meanwhile, if you're that set on bowling during peak hours.",

Mandina's may have been good back in the day, but I think it's gone the way of a lot of New Orleans 'institutions' and is just trading on its name and history.",

This time we were placed on the second floor which is mixed with meeting rooms. The view from the room was a roof and had no light. We called to request a room change but we're told they were full. No problem. However on Saturday night when we returned to our room we found out our room was directly above the ballroom. The music was extremely loud in our room. Now it was 9pm and most people would still be out, but I was in town to run my first marathon and wanted to try to sleep. We called the front desk and were told the music would be done at 10. Although we were told the day before they were full, they did offer to change rooms. Time wise I didn't think it would make sense to pack up and unpack if the music would be done in an hour. Well the music went on until after 10:30. I asked to have the manager call me on Monday-no call. There are many other options, will not be back to this one. If you do stay make sure to avoid the second floor.",

I was not disappointed at all. The food was good, service was quick, price was reasonable and I left there stuffed. I had a mushroom cheese steak and a bottle of water because it was a hot day. I'll try the fries next time because I plan to go back with no hesitation. The area was clean, parking is a challenge but if u get off the beaten path and park in the residential area and walk a block or two you'll be fine. Car was safe no issues or alarming concerns. I love the way both legendary restaurants are in the same area and they are both prosperous. A little friendly competition goes a long way and they have it down to an art. Just think they need to accept credit and debit cards in this day and age. The sandwich was $12 and that's a reasonable amount to use a card for your purchase.",

We placed and paid for our orders with the cashier, and a food runner brought our food out to our table, in about 10ish minutes. I ordered the Chicken bowl, which was pretty filling. The bowl itself wasn't the most flavorful, but I was able to spruce it up with their hot sauces, which they had quite a variety of at a sauce bar. I'd pop by here again when I'm in the area, if I'm craving tex mex, but I'll definitely explore other options first if I'm feeling adventurous.",

  "text": "NEST is a perfect place to come as a first time mom.  I brought my son here from the time he was 6 weeks old and we still go now, 3 and half years later.  As a first time mom I was able to take classes and meet other moms, arrange playdates, get questions answered and get out of the house.  As my son grew up he would ask to go to Nest all the time  It is such a cheerful, welcoming place to go with your babies and toddlers.  The teachers are so engaging and nurturing towards the children.  My personal favorites are Miss Joanie and Mr. Brett!  This place has become like a second home to my family and I am so excited for my next baby (due in early Jan) to have the same enriching experiences at Nest that my son had the first time around.",

  "text": "Tasty food in a nice cozy home-like setting.  My lower ranking is based only on what I suspect is unlikely circumstances.  First we came a couple of weeks after Hurricane Isaac and they were clearly doing some work on one part of the restaurant.  However, their signage was not very good so we walked into the work area and were stumped for a little while on where to go.  Then once we found the right entrance we were greeted by a guy in a workout outfit (tshirt and shorts) which seemed pretty unprofessional.  The last disappointment was that there was a cockroach running around the dining room (as a midwesterner I am not accustomed to cockroaches and frankly am scared of them crawling over my sandaled feet).  On the positive side the food was very good and the waiter was particularly knowledgable.  The pace of the meal was a bit faster than I prefer, but we were on a schedule so it worked perfectly for us.  The atmosphere was really nice with lots of artwork on the walls.  I'd definitely not turn down an offer to return, but considering all the options in NOLA I won't ever seek out another visit.",

Fake butter.. idk I don't like it's too sweet or tangy, possibly the garlic it look like I had a whole minced garlic jar in my platter (and I love garlic) but this was toooooooo much.

While my initial experience with Miles Nelson (one of the co-founders), was quite positive (timelines met, calls answered, quality product) he has since left the company. Since his departure, my customer experience with this company has been completely unacceptable and a real disappointment. I even recommended Dog Ear to a few of my colleagues and absolutely regret that decision.\n\nDog Ear does not make royalty payments in a timely manner, does not answer the phone, and the only published email address on the entire website is for general help. Every call is routed to voice mail no matter the time of day. Attempting to reach a human being is a fools errand. I have left multiple messages for their current CEO and co-founder Ray Robinson to no avail. They clearly do not understand the concept of customer service. \n\nTheir failure to make timely royalty payments renders them in clear breach of their author contract. I have filed a complaint with the Central Indiana Better Business Bureau for assistance in resolving unpaid royalties. These are legitimate royalties earned and reflected in the author payment system, their system of record. And to be clear, they isssue royalty checks 5 months after a sale. Yes, you read that correctly, they have a 150 day payment term that they are unable to meet.\n\nI would not advise any author to publish with Dog Ear. While they may be responsive when they take your initial publishing payment, you will be extremely disappointed in the future.",

Tom came out (despite not installing our heater) and checked all the pressure sensors, cleans the flame sensor and other parts. Unfortunately it appears the problem is electronic it's the board. He referred us to a local Lennox dealer.  He was at my house for two hours, had to take apart half the heater to get to a poorly located flame sensor. And he refused to bill me or take any money for his time.

If they are sloppy for this, they could be sloppy and not follow guidelines for procedures etc. So I walked out the door and never started their services. It is just wrong and her answer was not good enough and too flippant.",

I'm out the $100 deductible until they finish handling it with his insurance. \nIt's been almost 2 weeks after waiting for a response from Fast Eddy's. My car is still damaged and the lack of communication still stands.\nThankfully my awesome insurance will definitely be handling it with them. \nThe point of this review is to hopefully warn others of the potential for damage to your vehicle if it has any rock chips and fact that the owner won't be making the necessary repair process easy on you.",

We got a beer and ordered food at the bar. \n\nI asked for a darker beer and the response was a laugh and response of 'we don't have dark beer'. Ok then, Corona me. \n\nThis was my first time in Nashville and there was a bowl game in town so not sure if crowds are always like this. The place was packed. The rooftop was an audio smorgasbord of music coming from every direction, so much so that it was impossible to actually focus on any one band so it felt more like noise. Sitting inside was a much better way to enjoy the music. \n\nI'll always be grateful to drink a beer on a patio. Wings were really good. California wrap was ok. Make sure you order beer from the right rooftop bar because they don't let you go across roofs with liquor.",

  "text": "Honestly, as an above-average furniture consumer, I feel compelled at first to clarify that I am one of those folks who buys new furniture on a whim. I know and I like furniture, be it new, used, cheap, or custom-built. I've had it all. \n\nBob's has decent low-priced but pretty well-built furniture at  decent prices.  I cannot attest to the wearability of their upholstered goods, as I've yet to purchase that style of furniture.  I DID attempt to accomplish that, and therein lies the reason for the low marks from me.   \n\nI walked into the showroom  on 08/02/14 after several visits, doing some measuring, homework comparisons, etc. - and knowing exactly what I wanted.   I need a dining room table, and a Colby sofa.  I felt confident enough to buy here, and came prepared. Luckily: the dining room table that I'd chosen was on sale, (check the pit! You'll be amazed at what finds are back there for bargain prices!) - so i was a happy camper. \n\nI found a salesman and greeted him by saying:  \"This is going to be your easiest and quickest sale all day!  I want THIS and THIS.  Although I usually would pay cash for most items like this when i can - i wanted to take advantage of the Instant Credit offered by Bob's, being that I'd just settled on a house and was guardedly cash-poor after making settlement. \n\nBetween my $200.00 table (no chairs) and my Colby sofa,  it was a grand total of maybe $750.00.   But when the doofus sales guy took my application, for whatever reason - he  entered a credit amount of \"$4,000.00\" -  later telling me (after it got rejected) that he \"thought perhaps I might buy some other things\".    This is a totally stupid and back-handed practice, and i did NOT want my credit dinged for a proposed $4K request so soon after buying a home.   \n\nI left completely p**sed off, and the whole experience was ruined by this one dumb act.   It's a shame - i otherwise might have been a happy customer that day. \n\nI did go back and purchase the dining room table, but doubt that I'd ever go back to buy a sofa or any other major purchase unless it was a steal.  The aggravation of this one sales clerk did me in.",

  "text": "Ms. T and I decided to try this Texas based chain for some quick BBQ.  You have to understand this for what it is.  It is commercial, mass appeal BBQ and is probably as good as you would expect.  Ms. T had the smoked turkey and I had a combo platter of pork ribs, sliced brisket and pulled pork.  \n\nThe place smells more smoky than the meat actually tastes.  Starting from best to least on my platter, the ribs are not bad.  These are BBQ ribs, not smoked ribs.  They were juicy and came clean off the bone, with a fairly standard rub.  Smoke was very light.  If I returned, this is what I would order.  The pulled pork was next best and should be eaten in a sandwich with slaw and sauce, which would be tolerable.  It was not dry, dry, but was on the edge.  I prefer meat that can be enjoyed without drowning it in sauce and this pork needs some sauce.  Finally, for a Texas based chain, the brisket was not up to par.  St. Louis is not exactly a mecca for brisket so this may be as good as you find.  It was well done, as it should be, making it tender, but it was dry and short on flavor, including smoke and spice rub.  Actually is just roast beef (albeit brisket).   Again, this would make a tolerable sandwich with some sauce, but great brisket should stand on it's own.  All of these meats just lack great flavor.\n\nTheir sauce is decent.  It is a balance of sweet and tangy, which is good.  It lacked heat.   It it is not the extremely sweet sauce that you find in the Kansas City area in particular.\n\nMs. T's turkey was a kind of pressed turkey roll.  It tasted OK and was juicy, but the texture is spongy.  Sides are pretty mass produced; the slaw is a sweet, creamy style.  It was OK except for the occasional raw onion hunk that I would prefer to avoid.  The dilled potato salad tasted OK, except that it had four times too much dressing.  (If you want dilled potato salad, go to Louisana Café).  The corn bread is too sweet and very much like cake, much too soft and gooey.  Ms. T had fried okra which was apparently OK, not remarkable.\nThis place is 1-1/2 stars, I rounded up to 2 which is generous.  It is not to be avoided, but is not worth driving far.  If you have other BBQ close by, it can't be worth the drive to Dickey's.  I can't say I won't go back but it is not close to home so I can't say I will either.  If I'm driving by and need lunch, OK.",

  "text": "This is a warning for any bridal party members who can't physically be present for fittings. My daughter was a bridesmaid in a wedding last month. Since we live out of state, my daughter had to give her measurements over the phone. When the dress arrived, it was too small. We took it to our local alterations shop to see if they could alter it, but there was not enough fabric. Angel Bridal would not refund the amount of the dress (about $300), despite the fact that my daughter had given correct measurements. Angel had not asked for the measurement across my daughter's back, just her bust and waist size, and though she has a very small waist and bust, she is a swimmer with a broad back, hence the dress would not zip due to that. Angel refused to refund any of the cost of the dress, even when I explained that we had given the correct measurements as asked by them. Given the fact that it was just before the wedding and my daughter did not have a bridesmaid dress, I found a similar dress online (one with a full refund policy, imagine that??!), and ordered that, but it meant that I ended up spending a total of $600 for my daughter to get a dress that didn't even match those of the other bridesmaids.  This policy of Angel Bridal seems completely unfair to out-of-state bridesmaids who are unable to be fitted in person. Essentially, if the dress doesn't fit, too bad - no refunds. What way is that to run a business?",

I spent 5 years in Philly for school and work, and I haven't had better fried rice than the fried rice here at Beijing. The best. And I'm from New York. Not only is everything here so fantastically delicious (the fried rice!), but the staff are incredibly welcoming. There's never a long wait, they are attentive without being pushy or overwhelming, and the prices are so reasonable! If the fact that it were a BYO without a corking fee didn't sway you, know that whenever I come back to the Philly/Mainline area for Penn alumni events or work conferences, I ALWAYS make sure I eat here and get fried rice to take home!",

I wouldn't put it on the same playing field as Morton's, Harry & Izzy's, St. Elmo's, etc. If you go, don't miss out on the lobster pops or the cheesecake. The cheesecake may be the best cheesecake I have ever had. Overall, not disappointing, but not memorable.",

We both had omelettes (he had the village and I had the feta) which came with potatoes and a bread (he got biscuits and I had pancakes).  The omelettes were filling and had great flavor, the potatoes were also good and not frozen.  All that said, the pancakes stole the show.  They were light, fluffy, and sweet.  \n\nThe menu is huge, as a previous reviewer pointed out.  It is a combination of breakfast and lunch options.  A note to vegetarians: we're really stuck on the breakfast side of the menu, but at least there are several options there.  Also, the hours make it a little difficult to make it a regular dining option unless one works in Castleton during lunch.  However, it makes an excellent brunch or lunch spot on the weekends.\n\nNext time, I'm saving room for baklava!",

  "text": "Ordered 9 oz sirloin and shrimp with blue wedge salad and sweet potato. The steak was overcooked - twice. I ordered it medium, understanding that it could be a little too rare or a little too well. Neither of those things happened. Each time I was served a well done steak, not even a touch of red. Disappointed with the steak, I ate some of the second one because I wasn't waiting around for another recook. \n\nThe service was okay. Nothing was recommended nor were specials mentioned. We had to ask about the running specials - that we were emailed to us. It also took the manager 10-15 to come over and ask about the steak. She only came over 5 minutes after it had been redelivered. \n\nBest thing about this is experience was the salad. I'd come back for that not the steak.",

Its above another restaurant and the store front is not inviting at all.  \n\nWe went there with a $30 living social voucher, not expecting much.  However, the amount of sushi we got for the voucher was really impressive.  Its not 'cheap' sushi in a scary way... But our $$$ seemed to go far.\n\nAll the food was very good and the location was great, right off Rittenhouse, perfect for dinner before hitting the bars.  And being on the 2nd floor ended up giving a cool view during the meal.\n\nDefinitely give this place a try.\n\n\nUpdate#1:  Went back for the Hibachi.  Here's a secret, do the shared entree option.  Its an extra $8.95, you get a 2nd portion of the soup, salad, fried rice, and hibachi veggies and you share the meat of your choosing.  Its still a ton of food (doggie bags were required) and you save $10+ over a 2nd whole entree.  We rolled that extra $$$ into a sushi appetizer (rolled... sushi... get it?... eh).",

I quickly became uncomfortable and left the appointment. A little while later, I received inappropriate text messages from the consultant asking what is wrong. I definitely do not recommend this place of business. I cannot speak if this place helps you lose weight but I can say that their sales tactics seem questionable. I will lose weight by exercising and watching my diet and will save money in doing so. All others, be warned.",

Their dill pickle soup (which I tried from a friend's bowl) is to die for. If you like pickles, and I DO (it's the only thing Snookie and I have in common), you can't miss with this. I actually ordered their soup special for the day though, the corn chili chowder (meatless) and that my fellow yelpers was amazing! I also ordered the birdseed salad and found it to be very tasty! \n\nFor desert, I got a pretzel...yes i said pretzel ice cream cone and stayed pretty safe and went with their chocolate ice cream. It was sweet and salty and hit the spot! My friends got the pineapple upside down cake and it was quite the sweet treat! I am SO getting that next time and suggest you do too!\n\nOne down, I will say is one of my friends got the grilled cheese sandwich with apples on it and halfway through her meal, realized there weren't any apples on it. She didn't want to complain so she didn't say anything. I am sure if she would have, they would have offered a new sandy, at least I hope they would.\n\nOne other slight annoyance, is that when we got there, the seating seemed to be a bit unorganized and we were taken to one table but then it was dirty so then we went to another. No biggie but I will say while our server was certainly sweet, he moved a little on the laid back/slow side. We had to wait longer than I think we should have, given the lack of a huge crowd.\n\nOverall, though I would totes recommend this place and I sent my sister and niece that way this weekend while they are in town. I hope they leave with happy tummies...I think they will y'all!",

  "text": "Oh look, another \"I hate Comcast\" post.\n\nSeriously, wtf Comcast? \n\nI moved from NJ where I've had Comcast for several years. Since I was moving to Philly and that's a different state, I had to close my NJ account and open one in Philly. Okay! \n\nBut wait! The people who used to live in my apartment ran up the bill and never paid it. Great. Now I have to prove I am not them. Excellent. That rep tells me to go to the office on Columbus Blvd with my lease. Okay! \n\nI wait in line for 45 mins with 30 other people who wanted to be anywhere but hanging out in the Comcast line. I get up there, explain my story, hand over my lease and I am told \"Oh no we need your lease, ID, Social Security card, and a current utility bill from your old address\" I'm sorry, what? Since I don't normally carry my SS card and utility bills on me, I question why I was never told this and the heffer behind the glass says \"It's noted here that you were told to bring these items\" uh, no ? If i was I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM YOU COW. So, off I go, annoyed and ticked off.\n\nI call Comcast the next day from work to drag some fax numbers out of em. I get 3, 2 dont work. WTF. Fine so I will go stand in line for 45 minutes AGAIN to deal with the heffer with mad cow disease behind the glass wall. Now I understand WHY there is a wall b/c I can only imagine how many people would chuck a cable box at their dumb heads. Anyway, I go, give the cow my info and Im told the security department will review and have a decision  in 5-10 business days. WHAT. I want internet NOW!\n\nSo I go home and send what I shall refer to as the EECB (executive email carpet bomb) to 80 Comcast Execs, asking why its so hard to continue to give them my business? Who calls me 20 mins later but Comcast to setup my account ? Score! Until I have to call back to tell them what equipment I wanted (had to double check with the roomate) and was told there were setup fees (yuck), and to get them ASAP (the next day) Id have to pay $30 for overnight shipping. Grr. Fine. Gimme the goods. So my roomate stays home alllll day the next day (Friday) waiting for our Comcast goodies. No show. So I call Comcast AGAIN to ask em wtf and oh my stuff didnt ship. YOU DONT SAY!!! And they \"think\" it will ship the next day. Oh. Awesome.\n\nSaturday rolls around and I get a call from Comcast who says they cant setup my account b/c they need the dl/ss/utility bill of the other person on the lease. What. The account is solely in my name, to which Im told, the other person on the lease could not pay and stick Comcast. Uh, hello? Im the ONLY person on the account. So after I go back and forth with this woman, shes not getting that Im not having this crap and Ive given em everything they asked for & now a few days later its not good enough? I snapped, to be honest and told her to find whoever had the authority to fix my problems to call me back. 10 minutes later I get a call that my account has been setup and they have a tech coming out to do the install on Sunday morning. Free of charge I ask ? Crickets. Uhhh, yea, free of charge.\n\nSo Mr. Comcast man comes out on time (yippeeeeee) and sets us all up, minus a router since he had none. That's ok, Ive got a spare around here somewhere. 1 DVR, 2 cable boxes, and 1 modem later, we can has Cable and Internets...1 week late.\n\nOh and on the following Thursday (one week after I was supposed to get overnight shipping) Guess what shows up at my door via UPS ? 1 DVR, 2 Cable boxes, 1 modem, and 1 router.  \n\nThe thought of going BACK to the Comcast office to hand this crap in makes me want to jump off the Ben Franklin.\n\nComcast is sooooo lucky I can't get FIOS in my building.",

But the last two times we made the mistake of asking for something more...once we asked for the deluxe service and found that the time spent on our truck was exactly the same as every other car in the place. Nothing was done extra.\n\nThis time we had a large problem with tree sap on the truck, so the attendant suggested that nothing but a hand wash would take care of that. So paid the $55 and waited an hour. The results were probably worse than just the basic wash. Mud was left under the doors and there were still bug splats above the windshield. More importantly, they removed 80% of the sap drops. So you know they can remove them...they just gave up on it. \n\nIt's time for a new wash place....",

  "text": "Before trying Joe's Next Door for a lunch break, I was told that the BLT would change my life. That's a pretty high bar of expectation to set, but wooooow... yeah, I loved it. \n\nJoe's is located right on main street in Carmel, so you can't miss it. Stop in for a wide variety of spices, sauce, frozen meals, wine, sandwiches -- and obviously, meat. \n\nFor lunch I've opted for the BLT twice and the Cuban once. Both were delicious, but they really do work some magic on the BLT. It only takes about 5 minutes for them to make it, and the staff is very friendly. \n\nBe sure to grab a small bag of Broad Ripple Chip Co with your sandwich... and definitely, opt for the BLT.",

  "text": "I loved the original Cafe European and was so excited when they decided to open a new location after selling the previous. This location is more cafe style- which was actually perfect bc I would always stop to pick up lunch anyway. The owners are such lovely people. Everything is homemade and tastes absolutely delicious, and I was glad to see them keep some of my favorites from the old menu (like the cilantro chicken sandwich). They're so accommodating too. They have a regular menu and specials that always sound amazing- it's so hard to choose! My only qualm is that parking in that little plaza can get terrible so sometimes I don't stop just because of parking. It isn't their fault so I didn't knock off any rating and I know they have an agreement with the lot across the street, I'm just a snob and I don't want to cross Westshore in my heels ha- but it is disappointing sometimes nonetheless.",

  "text": "Ok - so I was born & raised in the area but have since moved to FL ... When I get back this way, I ALWAYS get my cheesesteak fix & usually attempt to try different merchants.  Especially avoiding Pat & Geno's ... \n\nLet me start at my arrival.  Upon entering the establishment I was glad to see most of the tables full at 3 pm -- good sign.  \n\nI was first in line to order ... And there were 2 gals present to assist w/ the order ... Surprisingly, I wasn't greeted or even acknowledged for 5 minutes!!!!!  The chick answered the Phone while I patiently waited ... Not even once making eye contact!!  That should've been the sign .... \n\nTwo (2) cheesesteaks ordered; 1 American wit & 1 Provo wit/out .... They charge an extra buck for the cheese on a cheesesteak (what?!?) ... Ended up getting one as a combo which included fries & a soft-drink ... Total was $22 bucks!!  \n\nWaited about 7 mins for my order.  Upon calling my number (same rude chick at the counter) I expressed my order was to go & politely asked for a bag ... To which her reply was, \"you'll have to wait a minute!\" Excuse the *^#¥ out of me ... But she did manage to hand me a bag this allowing me to bag my own food - how Customer Service is that?! \n\nNow on to the food review -- the sandwiches were average size.   Cheese was properly melted & distributed throughout ... The drip factor was present but the meat wasn't chopped up ... Ok, not a big deal ... But upon biting in the meat was a little chewy .... Flavor was mediocre but enough to fill the roll.  Onions had a decent flavor but that was about all I can say about that.  \n\nOverall, I would NOT go back.  There are many better places to give your money for a better quality experience & service.   Try Campos nearby for a much better experience from friendly to quality!   In fact, I've got a better local location in Orlando, FL from a Philly transplant who opened his shop called Brianto's!!  Well worth it as he uses best quality meat & flies in Amoroso rolls to add that authentic experience!",

The DJ is decent and they play a good combination of pop and hip-hop hits that you can definitely boogie to.  Also the dance floor is not usually super packed and people are generally having a decent time. \n\nIt is usually pretty dark in the whole place and I wouldn't recommend coming here to have  casual beer with your friends and chat.  This is more of a bar for the end of the night when you just want to let loose.  Drink prices are reasonable and they usually have some solid beer choices on tap.  I've never been here for the food...it feels more like a dirty dance floor club to me but I imagine it looks nice during the day too.

  "text": "I love this place so much that I don't even know where to begin this review.  I have dined or had drinks here at least 25 times over the last five years.  I have never had a less than perfect experience or less than perfect meal.\n     Starting with the atmosphere, what can I say that has not been said before?  The place is gorgeous, no really.... it is stunning.  The old converted church is lovely in every possible way and exudes charm from every corner both inside & out.\n     This is an elegant establishment and I just don't think we have enough of those in a world that is becoming ever more casual.  Check in with the host, check your coat and hang out at the bar.  They have a nice wine list that will surely have something for your enjoyment.  The bartenders have been the same for years & will create some of the finest cocktails in New Hope - I recommend the classic Martini.  The host will come get you when your table is ready and whisk you away to a romantic dining room on the second floor.  Look around as you climb the stairs, there is a lot to see in this beautiful old church.  \n     The grand dining room is large, complete with stunning art and magnificently high ceilings.  The tables for couples will be adorned with red rose petals.  \n     The food has always been exceptional, understand it is Southern cooking, Creole to be exact - lots of seafood, lots of classics such as jambalaya & gumbo.  The fresh French baguette they bring over is always warm, flakey in the outside and delicate on the inside.  The service has never been less than five stars.  I always like a little banter with whomever is serving and my last experience here was no exception.  Our server both entertained us with his quick wit and informed us about everything we considered on the menu.\n    We both ordered the beet salad with spinach & goat cheese as our starter and as a vegetarian I got the Eggplant Napoleon as my meal.  Creamy, buttery, fresh, flavorful with just the right spice to make an impression - delicious!!!  Naturally dessert had to be ordered and I got the carrot cake, be warned - it is a very large piece and is served with a scoop of homemade ice cream.  I couldn't finish the whole thing & I never leave dessert unfinished on my plate.  \n     As I said at the start, I have never had less than a five star experience at Marsha Brown's and will be back again in a few weeks.",

I found that parking was difficult if not impossible  at the 12th street location. When I tried the spring garden club, the fellow next to me on the treadmill had a loud phone conversation and the staff did nothing to stop him. Getting out of contract  is a $50 charge and a thirty day notice totaling $100. All in all, I went twice and paid $550. If you think this club might be for you, try it for a month before making a long term commitment. They have a strong sales pitch and from what I found seemed more interested in emptying my bank account with different tiered clubs and fancy plans. I was definitely not their audience and have found decent gyms with better parking for a fraction of the prices they charge.",

  "text": "UPDATE: 7/10/2019\n\nToday I got a burger with American cheese, bacon, and extra onions. I've got to say, I have found my new favorite burger place and that goes for all of US as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what they put in it but it's got me coming back for more.\nJust look at the photo and you can see the pickles are perfectly sliced thin, crispy, they're not too thick, the onions are sliced perfect, tomatoes are sliced perfect and all laid out in the right order. The shredded lettuce is just enough to hold it all together and keep things from sliding off. The buns are toasted perfectly. All together every bite was great. I hate when you buy a meal like a burger and every other bite, or only three or four bites, are good. Every bite of this burger was balanced with everything. That's a hard thing to do.\nKeep up the good work!\n\nOk, I do not understand how this place receives 3.5 stars. \nStaff are amazingly friendly and professional. Food is fantastic. Easy in and out. Big diverse menu. Real quality meat. What else could you ask for?\nI have hade the classic cheesesteak with extra cheese about 7 times now. Always great. Hot, fresh, packed with yumminess.\nI tried the French Dip recently and it's now my absolute fav in Boise area. The AuJus is rich and piping hot. Good flavor, not watered down. \nI will share a \"mishap\" that happened yesterday though. \nI ordered this sandwich and got something that didn't even look close to what I had last time. Meat was fine, as usual, but the provolone cheese was grated and lumpy. WHAAAAAT?!?! No go. \nI took it up to the counter and explained politely that doesn't even look good. \nThey gasped exactly as I did then after apologizing hurriedly remade a new one. They explained why that happened, which usually I don't care about but because I really like this operation I appreciated, then brought me my delicious masterpiece. \nOk, maybe not masterpiece but it was fabulous. Juicy, cheesy, bread was so soft and lightly toasted it was as if it came out of the oven two mins prior. SO fresh. \nIncredible meal. \nDon't forget to get a frequent buyer card and always ask for your military discount (if applicable). They'll ask for proof so no fakeys or posers. \nGet ther\nEnjoy",

People live in the state known as Delaware.\n    Even though we've moved since, we still return back to this place. \n\nMy family has seen this place change ownership several times, endured fluctuations in the quality of food, watched Whiteys flood in (and then trickle out)...\n   and I'm now glad to say, that Joy Tsin Lau seems to be in a solid place now. \n\nHaven't been back for dim sum in years, but we usually grab dinner here whenever I fly home into Philly (so several times a year at least). \n   Thankfully, the white:yellow ratio has slowed down and reduced recently.

  "text": "This was my first wine bar after moving from Atlanta to St Pete. What makes this place so freakin awesomely versital is the layout and multiple seating options. It has a nice but small bar around the bartendar that seats about 10 people. It has another ledge and stool chairs that acts as a bar (but no bartender there). It has multiple tables and sitting areas to accomodate groups of people. And it has a couple of handsome sofas (and not something that looks like it wasa reject picked up on frat row) that allow for an intimate experience that great for a date where you could actually carry on a conversation. They even have a very small patio area too - only big enough for a small group though.\n\nThere are waiters assigned to the seating areas, so this is not one of those help-yourself to a wine spout on the wall establishments. They also have beer here if you want to be that way but no open bar. \n\nThe reason I chose this as the first wine bar was because it did look elegant and not like some hole in the wall but also b/c it was the only one open until Midnight on a Friday. Most of the other wine bars in the area close at 10pm! Wussies. 10pm is a pathetic closing hour for a wine bar on a Friday night.\n\n\nWhat also makes this place kinda cool and they seem to always have events or specials or something going on here. From the calendars I've seen they seem to consistently have a \"SUPER\" happy hour every last Friday of the month that last from 4pm to Midnight.\n\nMy only complaint was the music. No, the volume was fine; it was suicide-inducing theme that ran with every song selction. You know - sad Adel songs, Bruno Mars songs and the like. I'm like - are they purposely playing these depressing tunes to engage you to drown more of your sorrows in more wine?\n\nWe'd go back though. Hopefully Pandora or whatever they decide to play will be less depressing.",

  "text": "This store is definitely a store for high schoolers who need books off their book list for the semester. (They also have a used book section that is quite limited - more mystery and romance books than straight up lit.) The books are organized just like the bookstore I used to grab books at when I was a high school student. I still would have bought a book anyway (some books that high school students are assigned are great books! Amerika by Kafka? Never read it. Should read it.), BUT they are cash only! At a book store!! Where a typical purchase is probably more than $10! But cash only. So I put my books back, apologized for not having cash, and walked out (probably never to return). If you're a high school student near Franklin or a parent of such a student, this store is probably great (so long as you have cash on you), but for regular readers/book lovers, it's not a great store. B&N in Cool Springs or Landmark Booksellers are probably better options.",

My wife and I decided to try the Teppanyaki  style  tables where the chef cooks right in front of you and puts on a bit of a show. the service was very attentive and the chef was funny and did a wonderful job. Five other people joined our table and it was fun talking with them. We exchanged business cards at the end of the meal so that was a bonus too. I highly recommend this new restaurant. i saw too that if one goes for lunch the prices which were reasonable for dinner are discounted at lunch by about 40%. Yummy.",

So, when we went in the only options for us to choose from were ribs and pulled pork. We also got the baked beans and cole slaw.\n\nThe ribs were good, very moist. The pulled pork was nothing special. We did like the hot BBQ sauce (mild was very bland), and the sides we ordered. They felt bad they were out of all their food and did throw in extra ribs and pulled pork to help make up for it. Because of their great service, we will definitely come back during a busier time (maybe Summer?) and give them another shot!",

  "text": "I want to apologize as I begin this review because I know some people put some time and money into opening this restaurant, and they could stand to lose it just from the words I say.  But, every business, even restaurants, must offer a reasonable amount of merchantability with their product, and we did not find this here.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt in saying that we did show up later in the evening, but, the night we showed up, they were supposed to be open until 2:00 a.m.  They should have closed much earlier.\n\nTo start, the service was slow, slow, slow.  When we got there, there were just two other tables of people there, and we thought they were already finished - just sitting around talking.  They were not.  They were still waiting for their food.  One table had three, related couples sitting at it, and each couple received its food separately.  It was as if the place was preparing each and every order one by one.  They were.  I just found that kind of unusual since there were at least four people in the kitchen that we could see, and it seemed that they could do more to expedite the process.  \n\nWell, we finally got our food, and we were both wishing we hadn't.  I really don't know why I ate mine.  I guess I was just hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  The entire time I was eating it, I kept thinking two things.  The first was, \"Why didn't I go to Rouse's and get a can of Chun King?  It would have been better.\"  The second was that joke by Ron White when he talks about his wife's cooking and what happened when they tried to feed it to the dog.  They later found the dog in the corner of the kitchen licking his butt.  Ron White commented, \"He was probably trying to get the taste out of his mouth.\"  I was wishing I had that kind of flexibility.  The only time I ever had a worse meal in New Orleans was at the \"Moon Wok\" down the road on Dauphine.  That time, at least, the food tasted pretty good \"going down,\" but not so much coming back up.  The food at CreAsian didn't have that head start.  \n\nSo, what was wrong with it?  I had Vegetables with Tofu.  The vegetables may have been fresh, but I couldn't tell.  They were way overcooked.  Also, the cook used way too much oil.  It was pretty much a mess of oily, overcooked vegetables.  The Tofu wasn't too bad, and I don't really care for the \"soft\" tofu, cooked or otherwise, and I did like that they offered brown rice on the menu.  As for my wife, she had the eggplant.  She loves eggplant, but her's, too, was overcooked, and greasy.  To show just how greasy, they served the dish in a partitioned, \"to go,\" styrofoam container.  All of the entree was in the large partition.  The other two partitions were half filled with grease.  My wife kept having to pour grease into those extra partitions just to make her food edible.  It didn't work.  \n\nI feel real sorry for these people, and I am real sorry to have to write this review, but there are so many good places to eat in New Orleans, I don't want anyone else to waste their time or their lives spending time at this one without knowing about it ahead of time.  Now, if you like greasy food, and Chun King Chinese, you might like this place.  I, on the other hand, have had much better, and know what much better tastes like.  I would never be happy with the food we served no matter the price, and not matter the locale.",

  "text": "Sorry to say we ordered prom flowers for my daughter and date. When we arrived to pick them up, there was a sign on the door saying they were running behind due to a death in the family. Totally understandable. I asked if we could pick up around 4 and was told they would be ready for sure by 3 pm. Sent my husband at 4 to pick up and they weren't ready. They called at 5 and said they were ready. We had to pick up and deliver to where pictures were already in progress. When we opened the box, we were very disappointed to see what we paid over $60 for. The boutonnière that cost over $20 was 2 of the smallest miniature roses on a stem with nothing else but black ribbon lace wrapped around the stem. My daughter's corsage didn't make it through dinner. Every flower fell off within 90 minutes of doing nothing but eating dinner and taking a few pictures. I really wouldn't have cared if they had apologized for the lack of quality due to the circumstances or offered to take a percentage off, but that didn't happen.  I really wish I could write a glowing review, but this was not a good experience.",

  "text": "OK, I grabbed a seat at the sushi bar. it's self seating at opening at 11am. This is one of the few places where the bar seating is open. Here you don't have to put in that stupid little check off sheet to order or wait for a server to get to your table. Just tell the chef what you want. There were like 7 chefs on duty!  \n\nI will say the sushi is very good here and the pieces are a little smaller than average, but that's a good thing!, you should be able to eat each piece in one bite. The fish quality was good on all of the species that I tasted. I like nigiri better as you can get the taste of the actual fish and see the skill of the chef in making the cuts and forming the rice. The rice was good too, not pressed to hard and not falling apart either. \n\n Sitting at the bar you can make special requests easy and they'll do it for you. The service was fast enough that I wasn't waiting long for my next selection to appear in front of me. I gotta say this is probably the best sushi place I've found in Reno. The prices have gone up recently to $22 for lunch and I think $29 for dinner ... no difference in menu selections, just eating later for dinner will cost you more. I will return. not for the dinner price tho ...\n\nThis place is super popular, so if you don't want to wait, get here at or before 11am and wait by the door. When they open, just go in fast and grab a seat, as there is no hostess seating anybody at that time.",

Despite there being no cocktail list on the menu, I was able to impress upon the waiter my interest in a well crafted cocktail and was rewarded with an ingenious beverage involving gin, cilantro, muddled cucumber and other things.  It was rather delicious.  The appetizers including crab cakes, portabello blue cheesecake, and something resembling a pasty were phenomenal.  My lamb shank was very good as well.

Liquid ravioli with crab. Something with bacn foam on top. It just went on and on every 10 minutes and each was perfect.\nSalad with 5 lettuces' had a wonderful dressing and the Pork app. was wonderful. \nPoached lobster was as good as anywhere and the lobster bisque in a small cup was the best ever. Not thick like most, but more of a hearty type broth. Hard to describe, but if it's on the menu, get it. The chicken was a type of bird from China that was on the small side, but pure white when you cut into it and had a wonderful taste.\nMy only complaint , and it's minor, was the choice of dessert. The donuts with dipping sauce were not on a par with the rest of the evenings food.\nThey were a little chewy , not light like I thought they would be. The dipping sauces were good, but next time there were other desserts that I would try.\nService was attentive, parking is what you can find on the street, and at night the place can be a little hard to find, but just look the sign at the corner of 45th and Larchwood.\nIf people asked me for a BYO in downtown I would say this first and Fond second. If you're in the suburbs then Sycamore, or Lotus Farm to Table in Media.",

The outside seating looks great, but it was a tad too chilly for my liking.\n\nWhile the menu isn't really extensive, the food is particularly good. I got the pasta of the day (the last one) and it was BEYOND delicious. The noodles were house made (!!) along with the sauce. The dish was topped with perfectly cooked chicken and goat cheese. It was delectable. \n\nMy guest had the BBQ brisket and was fairly pleased. \n\nSeveral reviews say that the service is a tad slow, and I can agree and disagree to that. I came for brunch a few months back and it was really slow. However, on my most recent trip, I was very pleased with our waiter. He was very good about checking in with. \n\nI'm sure I will return.",

The chicken was heavy on breading and light on chicken. I did like the sweetness of the sauce... it balanced out the saltyness of the soy sauce. The price is average for this type of take out place. The service is ok. I went an hour befor closing and they looked like they were ready to go. I will return as I love some chinese food...soon to be a regular!",

  "text": "I'd definitely skip this place for better buffet like \"Hokkaido Seafood Buffet and Grill\" in Swansea, about 15 minutes away. They have better choices and much better treatment of their customers. While slightly more expensive; it's still under $30 for 2 people and their lunch buffet is also better quality too. \n\nBamboo Valley is really generic Asian Buffet meal, cheap and subpar food. They have a Mongolian BBQ as well that looked questionable too. The \"sushi\" here was the cheap cut and slap together kind that is seaweed paper, rice, and fish toppings that seems just barely bordering on the passable. If anything this place doesn't deserve a \"Grade 'A' food\" rating needs to be revoked and given a B or C instead. \n\nThe customers were moderately noisy and seemed like the local divey for late lunch crowd. Several parents and their children clustered for a group meal at one of the larger tables. The wait staff brought us drinks in a haphazard fashion and seemed more interested in specific tables to wait upon, rather than equal treatment of all customers. It's likely they were more interested in pleasing those customers then attracting new clients.",

One of the exhibits was borderline child porn, and made us all very uncomfortable. Believe me, I love art, and my appreciation stretches quite far having lived with an art student for a year, but half naked 4 year olds in suggestive positions kinda creeps me out. Other exhibits include LiveJournal shots of someone's eyeball with a cell phone camera from 2005 and a non air conditioned hallway which is sure to doom any real art in months time. Don't get me wrong, we saw good stuff, like that one of the woman getting a tattoo. There's just not enough art. Maybe 5 dollar's worth. Not ten.",

I saw the reviews from last year and was so excited to go, I was a little disappointed that there was not a pre-party mostly because I was hoping to have a large group to go thorough the hunted houses and everyone took their tickets and went inside. But Chris came to my rescue....Thanks to him I was able to navigate the park without walking in circles like I usually do.  So to the hunted houses. I can't remember them all. A few call my attention but I was not scared by any of them. Something about having people screaming and hitting stuff in my ear was not scary but annoying. The clown house was cool and some of the effects in the other houses was surprising like the guys in the ceilings. One particular character got so closed to my face that he actually hit me in the nose with his mask and it hurt for the rest of the night so after that I wasn't getting scare but ready to tell them to get out of my face. Anyways having VIP passes and not having to wait in line was great, not to mention the drinks tickets. The Instagram contest was cool even though we got all the pictures I decided not to enter. Honestly I was mostly scared of riding the coasters at night.... Go figure!!!! Can't wait for next year.",

Never let him go), an employee started helping my friends and I upon arrival. He was very personable, down to earth, and most importantly: honest and straight forward with his reviews on the products I inquired about (which was greatly appreciated). The variety of juice flavors is pleasantly overwhelming, and as this experience was new to me, John remained very patient with us as we tasted different flavors until we found some we liked. As far as I'm concerned, I have no need to go to any other vape store. This place is literally a one stop shop that does repairs and all. See you all soon!",

It is one of my favorite restaurants in Tampa and where I chose to have my birthday dinner there this year (it fell on a Sunday which would have been a problem in the past, but they are now open until 8 on Sundays).\n\nFor drinks, they have a full liquor bar of course. I've had their Bloody Mary before and it's fantastic. However, I'm a big craft beer fan and Datz always has a huge selection of good beers to choose from. And it's not always the same which is even better.\n\nFood is where Datz really shines. The menu is always changing and I always like to try something different when I come here, so while I can't recommend one specific dish, I can pretty much recommend everything. I have never been disappointed by anything I've ordered here. And as if I hadn't had enough to eat already on my birthday, they gave me a free cupcake for desert which was, of course, delicious!",

The location was really good, for the tourist things we were doing.  The concierge was helpful in explaining hiking trails near the hotel.  Now for the not so good: getting to/from room took forever, and I thought the staff was not very friendly, excluding the concierge.  The front desk clerk was nice, but gave us a little attitude when we asked him to explain again the best way to get to our room (we were almost as far as you can be from the front desk; had to walk outside to another building, take one elevator up; walk down a hallway; then take another elevator up; then walk down a hallway).  When we ordered a drink from the bartender on New Year's Eve, she did not say a word, other than \"do you want to run a tab or pay now.\"  How about, hello, thank you, have a good night, Happy New Year.  We checked out via the tv, but had a question about the bill.  The person who answered the phone to answer our question was very nasty.  \n\nI do not like \"resorts\" where exercise room and/or spa are not in main building.  You should not need to walk outside to get to exercise room or spa.\n\nViews are amazing.\n\nI question whether it is proper to charge a resort fee.  I question even further whether it is proper to charge tax on the resort fee.",

Sadly, the food is mediocre at best and for the price just not good. The wedge salad and the Mac and cheese are very good. The steak, oysters and baked potato no better than what you'd get at Outback. The spinach, or cheese with green stuff mixed in, is truly awful.  I'd say go to the bar for drinks but avoid the food.

This brewery may be tucked away, but they're putting out some great beer and awesome food in this little unassuming place.\n\nParking available behind the building (on the west side) with doors in the front and the back. The bar takes up a lot of room inside, but there's plenty of seating available. Mark and team is making some great brews.. I'm a big fan of the Coconut Porter and the Big Ed IPA (throwback to the days of ATA) is always a winner. I've heard they're currently making the third batch of this IPA that was originally supposed to be a limited release.\n\nNow, you could stop just with the beer and be quite happy, but if you're hungry, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the food menu and grab a bite to eat. The kitchen is in the basement and the chef puts out some killer grub. Nope, no simple fried bar food here. Instead, you can get a great salad or a sandwich or even an entree that will go great with whatever you're drinking. \n\nI'm keeping this place on my radar..

I agree wholeheartedly with some of the prior reviews expressing that this place delivers anything but FAST food. I went to the Bryn Mawr location for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place was deserted and yet they still took about 20 minutes to make two egg wraps, one smoothie, and sweet potato hash. Totally unacceptable! No sense of urgency and overall, the staff seemed like they had no idea what they were doing. No greeting when I arrived and no apology when they took forever to make my order, looking like bewildered, incompetent idiots the whole time. Very frustrating and irritating experience, and I won't be back to the Bryn Mawr location ever again. They really need to work on training their employees and making sure they know how to make what is on the menu quickly. I don't think that's too much to ask.",

She really targeted my painful areas without sending me crying which I find happens normally in my massages. The pressure was perfect and I could just feel my muscles melting.\n\nMy neck had the most pain and when she found the spots that were causing me all he trouble she did some trigger point stuff and I could literally feel the muscle just submit to her magic. I really left that appointment feeling more relaxed and euphoric than I had in a very long time.

Would highly recommend Umai Umai for a casual dinner with superb service and food. 5/5 overall.",

Each day they arrived on time.  The installers cleaned up the house very well each day.  I cannot say enough about how well all the flooring looks, the installers were very precise.

After a couple of months I was finally able to speak with someone explained the situation and was told to send an email stating I was canceling his membership since I am in charge of his finances and bills now , and they wouldnt charge his account but it takes 30 days to go into effect .  Well it just so happens on the 30th day they charged his account 49.99 and when I called t hem they said its basically a cancelation charge but I was not told this when I spoke with the manager.  They had been taking money from his account since December 2019 and he hasn't even been there in the fitness center since oct.2019. Wow!! That's how they do business??? I will tell EVERYONE I know to NOT start a membership there as they are very wrong!!!!  They even charged him when they were closed due to covid 19!!! Sorry ass business!!!",

  "text": "Me and my wife stopped in for happy hour on Weds night @5:30. The place wasn't busy yet. We sat there for 20 mins before anyone came to our table. I ended up waiting 45 min to get a beer. The first beer I ordered  came after 15 mins of ordering it and it was flat. I took it up to the counter to let them know. The rude waitress told me to go sit down and they would pour me another beer. When I told her that I thought ther must be an issue with the keg. She repeated harshly for me to take a seat and they would pour me another of the same beer . I then went and found our actual waitress and told her I wanted a different beer. The other waitress came over and told her to pour me another of the same beer . Again telling me to go sit . We got our food and I tried the Caesar salad. The salad was drowning in dressing that  was like watered down mayonnaise. There was something in a small condiment cup that looked and tasted like it had been scraped off of the bottom of the fridge. Finally after 45 mins my beer was delivered to me. We had ordered the \" special which was falafel plate .It  was deep fried to the point where it was hard to bite into. I opted not to eat any of the food . My wife was hungry so she nibbled at the gross food. I wanted to send it all back , pay for our drinks and leave but instead we left most of the food on our plates finished our drinks. Paid for the disgusting food and left a nice tip for the poor service. Not going back to this place . It's sad because we like the atmosphere and it has been fun taking friends from out of town there. Never again. Our actual waitress was nice and friendly and was juggling tables while the nasty waitress chatted with a table of friends , she also almost did a faceplant because of the inappropriate shoes she was wearing.",

They offer great service--maintenance requests are handled quickly and efficiently. They are easy to work with and flexible. Heather, the property manger, is a gem. You can have your packages delivered to the management office and they will drop them off at your door--no Amazon boxes left outside. There's free wifi and they don't gouge you on rent increases. They own buildings throughout University City, Center City, and other Philadelphia neighborhoods. If you want to move to another location of theirs, you can do so without breaking your lease and they just transfer your security deposit and last month's rent. They invest in the apartments and take good care of them. Highly recommended.",

The flavors in the dishes are distinct yet harmonious; the char on the rice noodles in the gravy chow fun come through and enhance the dish but do not overpower the delicate noodles and silky beef slices. The special greens (pea shoots when we went) were cooked perfectly, retaining their bright green color and a bit of crunch. \n\nWhen we first went, we were a little put off with the extra cost of rice and perhaps we ordered the wrong thing. But, after reading the rave reviews, we thought we'd give it another try, and I'm glad we did! Kwok's is a bit cozy, seating no more than 32. But, the food is definitely worth it!",

  "text": "With the poke bowl business becoming more abundant throughout Reno, it's difficult to pick a place! Bluefin stands out (at least out of the other poke bowl places I've been in) by having their regulars and large having an extra scoop of protein. For example, Poke King's regular is 3 scoops ($10.95), large - 5 scoops ($13.95). Whereas Bluefin offers 4 scoops for their regular ($11) and 6 scoops ($14) for their large! An extra scoop of seafood for the same price? Sure! My go-to sauce is always the spicy aioli with the unagi sauce. Their variety of toppings are for the most part pretty similar to other poke bowl joints. \n\nWe've come here to Bluefin on a multiple of occasions; location being the main reason for we live close by. The service is fast and efficient and most of the time we come here for a poke bowl on the go to enjoy at home. \n\nAlso, certain days they may have specials! This past Monday [6/25/18], they had a Unagi Bowl where unagi was the protein of choice with pre-set toppings. \n\nThe fish is good and reminds me of home. Coming from Hawaii, poke bowls are addicting and to have a couple of restaurants in Reno is great to have! It's no place like home, but it's pretty damn close. \nI'm no taste expert to what's fresh versus what is frozen, but as long as my taste buds don't taste anything too fishy then I give my seal of approval. \n\nWe'll always be back here whenever we have our poke bowl on-the-go cravings.",

  "text": "Recently I was sent some flowers from Cerise Floral Studio.  The arrangement arrived and was absolutely beautiful, and very fitting for fall.  The arrangement was contained in a glass vase, which was within a birch bark vase, and included sunflowers, tulips, roses, and lots of unique decorative greenery.  \n\nUnfortunately, the next morning when I got to work the flowers were mostly dead, and when I looked in the vase there was no water.  I called Cerise immediately when they opened, and they were apologetic and offered to deliver a new bouquet later that day.  There were really no questions asked, and I was happy that they were willing to re-deliver since my office location is a significant distance from their shop.\n\nWhen the new flowers arrived, the bouquet wasn't quite the same and not quite as nice, and a note was left for me not to leave the flowers near the heating vent.  I think I was being blamed for why the flowers were dead- little did they know that the heaters were actually broken the previous day, and thus they flowers were not overheated!!  I think the no-water situation was probably the root cause of the dead flowers.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the quick and easy response from Cerise, and I would probably use their services if I needed to order a modern arrangement in the future,.",

  "text": "Wow! We have been wanting to try LuLou's for a number of years now, for a special occasion since it is so expensive...so we went for our anniversary this past Saturday. Wow, again...everything was excellent from the beautiful but trendy/hip/chic/mighty cool decor to the wait staff and most especially the food! Sezmu used to be my fav restaurant in Reno, but sadly they recently closed. 4th St. Bistro is really excellent, too, but something about this place....is making it my new fav. Too bad it is so expensive or I might drive down to \"Draino\" more often to eat here!  Since we had some martinis at Roxy (gotta love their happy hour) prior to dinner, we skipped wine with our meal here. For starters: I had the chile \"relleno\" (1/2 of a pasilla chile - at least I think it was a Pasilla - stuffed with tempura FL rock shrimp and served with a citrus salad), which was spicy and incredible tasting. I especially enjoyed the citrus flavors with the spice of the chile and the crunch of the shrimp! YUM! My husband had the Baked Lobster, served escargot-style. I tasted that, as well, and it was also very flavorful. For mains: I had the BBQ'd Quail with harissa sauce, a lovely spring succotash, and a truffle mac & cheese that was to die for - in fact my husband finished mine off! My husband had the veal tenderloin for his main dish, and while it, too, was wonderful, I was on a spicy kick that night - so I liked my spicy choices better!  Can't wait until next year's anniversary to return and try some new things on their ever-changing menu. They don't have a website or an online menu, but if you call them and ask them to fax you a menu, they will.",

We never did get any water. \n\nHe ordered a steak burger with thousand island dressing on it. I ordered chili Mac with a steak burger with mustard and onion.   Of course his burger had no dressing on it. My steak burger with onion was laughable.  It had one piece of onion on it. NO, NO!!  Not a slice of onion - one piece of onion. After waiting a while for our food, we were not about to complain about anything and have it taken away to get it fixed. \n\nAs we paid our bill at the counter, we both looked at the floor behind it and it was horrid.

I was told by Uber driver that we were going to the 'hipster' part of town - East Nashville, and according to Yelp, he also dropped me off at the most hip coffee place in the city. Thank god I didn't wash my hair today and chose to wear a black wide brimmed flimsy hat and combat boots (seriously). \n\nFor what this place has to offer, it does its job well. Great coffee, and a good place to read or laptop browse for a few hours. I would say this isn't the best place is you're looking to study intently- People watching is distracting and in general there are no nooks or crannies that you can stick yourself in to have some privacy. \n\nIt is great for what it is- a little hide away to grab some coffee to start your morning and do some reading with a generally quiet crowd that keeps to itself. The baristas weren't assholes to me but maybe it was my hat that helped me blend in ;)",

  "text": "So how do you tell the story of a building that houses multiple venues for todays varied performers, performances and audiences, that was originally constructed over 100 years ago?\n\nIn my best Elmer Fudd, verwyyyy carefuwyyyy, hahahahahah! So pay attention and I'll tell you the story you've longed to hear.\n\nIt was 28 Feb, 1910 when the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine replete with Potentates, Nobles and Ladies, opened the state-of-the-art Murat Theater within the Murat Temple at the corner of E Michigan and N New Jersey streets.\n\nThe Indy Shriners named the ornate building, complete with Islamic, Arabic and Egyptian architecture, after Joachim Murat (Mur-ah), a general serving Napoleon in Italy and Egypt back in the day.\n\nThe original theater of those Potentates, Nobles and Ladies, the venue that so many of todays theater goers love to hate, has had the Indianapolis Symphony and Indianapolis Opera Company call its original 1,950 seats home over the years.\n\nBut wait say you, todays' web-o-matic says there are 2,600 seats in that space. S'up wit dat?!? So this is where the pissing and moaning starts!\n\nIn '95 the Indy Shriners saw income decreasing and refurbish costs skyrocketing so in an attempt to stop the madness, they struck a deal with Sunshine Promotions, todays Live Nation. A-HA!\n\nNow I wasn't there, but i imagine it could have gone something like this...\n\"Tell yous what...yous guys pony up da dough for da fixes and we's 'ill give yous a 99 year lease... AND yous can even jam in anudder 600 or so's chairs... AND charge des mooks anudder saw-buck just fur da prillage ta buys a ticket.  What say's yous?!?\n\nWell, maybe not like that but you get the picture.  Money was tight and this was a way to save a truly historic theater! Give and take and... get took so to speak.\n\nAs Pharaoh said in the days of Yule Brenner... So let it be written, so let it be done!\n\nAnd all that, brings us today, to reviews with \"bad sight lines, big heads in the way, narrow seats, no leg room, no slope, poor acoustics, bad signage, expensive booze, steep stairs to long pee lines, crowded intermissions, chaotic clustersf*@!\"(wow that IS harsh) and finally...neanderthal patrons who can't tell time or understand the words \"your, don't, electronic, turn, talk, off and device\" no matter how they are arranged and regardless of punctuation!?!\n\nAnd now for the the other side.  After 2 decades of supporting this venue and its myriad of shows and performances from Widespread Panic to Radio City Music Hall's Rockettes High Kick'en Christmas Extravaganza with live Camels to Little Feat post Lowell George, to Friday nights' Book of Mormon and all things in-between, you too can survive the FUBAR.\n\n1. Always GO EARLY to the Murat box office to buy your tickets.  You'd be surprised at how helpful the underpaid ticket person can be.\n2. Save your pennies (actually fives or tens would be better) and buy the best tixs you can afford for Broadway Touring shows. From an acoustic and visual standpoint shoot for something in the center section (orchestra) at least 15 rows back and no further back than EE under the balcony or on either side in the first 10 seats off the inside aisles.  Believe it or not the seats are in fact offset just a little in each row and yes there is a gentle slope to the stage almost the entire length of the theater on the main floor.\n3. The Balcony is also not a bad way to go. In the upper air, look for the first 15 rows with the same rules off to the sides as the main floor.\n4. Yes, seats are narrow, check your coat, and loose some weight lard butt.\n5. Yes, leg room is airline like. Deal with it and stand up when someone needs to get by...be a human being!\n6. Yes your first experience with this theater can be confusing, but if you arrive early, take your time, you should be able to figure it out.  There are signs and arrows, kinda like driving a car, not rocket science.\n7. Don't buy the overpriced watered down hootch and you won't have to piss and moan about pissing and moaning in long lines at intermission thus avoiding chaotic clusterf*@!(wow that IS harsh). Heck, I'm the poster boy for an AA ad and even i can go without for a couple hours.\n8. If, like me, you suffer from WMD (think about it, short and slow), all you can do is pray to the higher power of your choice that no NBA player taller than Muggsy Bogues sits in front of you, cause if you get two NFL Jeff Saturdays side by side, you ain't see'en much.  I don't care what venue you're in, you can just Listen to the Music.\n9. As for the Neanderthals, you know, i hate to say it but, i beleive it has gotten worse over the years.  The only thing you can do is call them on their inappropriate behavior from incessant talking to the ubiquitous cell phone fumbling.  Call em fast and call em often, just don't call em on your phone, no pun intended.\n10. Finally, when you go to the Murat, go in Steely Dan style, do it with your Fez on!",

  "text": "I am amazed that JMH has anything above 2 stars. They are the most ridiculous company to deal with. I'd prefer not to develop a brain tumor going over everything they do to annoy me, so I will pick some things out.\n\nWhen you move in, any landlord is required to paint the apartment, and they specialize in slopping on a thick layer over absolutely everything. Because of this, your windows won't open correctly, any door hinge is slathered over and seized up, and there are white paint drips over every surface. We have had leaks which is understandable, but instead of actually fixing the problem and removing any mold, they bring a man over to paint over everything. Our apartment has exposed brick and because the building is so old, some of the bricks tend to crumble. Instead of maybe attempting to replace a brick here and there, they decide to swiftly paint over the whole thing. I like to joke that they will use paint to fix any problem; clogged drain, lockouts, or late rent is no match for a fresh coat of white glop! We had problems where maintenance people needed to fix something and instead of letting us know in advance when they were coming, one of us would happen to catch a random stranger in our house snooping around. They did that a few times saying it is too difficult for them to let us know when someone would come, but I would remind them that what they were dong was illegal. Now, the threat of calling 911 on their men is the only thing keeping them away. \n\nI really don't want to get into the Fairmount office staff. The two women are very unorganized at what they are responsible for; I would constantly get phone calls to my cell asking to speak to my roommate or to remind my roommate of something. When it is only those two in there, you have to wait until they are finished talking to a friend on their cell phone or until they are done reading something on their facebook wall. If they need to write a note about your apartment or lease (like my roommate's phone number) they will pull out your lease file and scribble it into the margins of your lease which is something my cat would think is logical. The office manager is bipolar at best. He will want to kiss your feet one day and the next he is tearing up papers and throwing them in your face. I don't really have much interaction with the assistant dude. He sends you a monthly newsletter to inform you about things like clogs or frozen pipes, but they use it as an opportunity to TELL YOU IN ALL CAPS HOW THEY WILL FINANCIALLY MOLEST YOU IF YOU DO ANYTHING THAT THEY JUST SAID NOT TO DO IN THE NEWSLETTER. \n\n\nYou really can't avoid them if you are looking for an apartment in the Art Museum area. If you're looking for a cheap place, you definitely get what you pay for. Just hope and pray you don't need to coordinate with them about a problem.\n\nWhen I moved out, the deposit check they sent me bounced which is just hilarious.",

No need for eggs or sausage, you'll be full before you're done.\n\nThe pancakes are just right, not too heavy and plenty of flavor.  No need for syrup on these, they're plenty sweet as is.\n\nI had heard stories about long lines getting into the place.  I guess we were lucky because we walked right in.

  "text": "Markley St, Norristown, PA\nGreat service and drive thru. And a cute Indian guy took my order. You know why people like chains? Because they know what they want n dont need to think too hard or make a decision over small things like coffee and dont need to be too surprised as they know what to expect. Thats why chains typically do well. People dont always have the energy to figure out if a store is selling something they want when they are out shopping and get exhausted and need to fuel up their bodies. By the way...the Decaff was a tad bit sweet. I just needed something hot. Usually dont like that much sugar in my decaff.",

  "text": "Definitely the trendiest-looking Vietnamese restaurant I have ever dined in. You can tell it's not your usual pho spot when you walk in and there's no smell of fish sauce lingering around. \n\nMy group decided to let me choose my post-Broad Street Run brunch. I asked them how Le Viet's Cafe Sua Da is and it took no further discussion. After twenty minutes of circling the blocks around Le Viet, we found parking (thank Buddha, I was starving). The restaurant wasn't too busy for a Sunday during brunch hour. Worked out well for us and we were seated right away.\n\nSince I knew I was going to be gorging at some type of buffet in the evening as my BSR reward to myself, I opted for small items. I ordered Goi Cuon, Banh Xeo, and a Cafe Sua Da. Little did I know, the appetizers were not small at all. The Goi Cuon was stuffed with noodles, a little too much in my opinion. But the dipping sauce was delicious.\n\nThe size of the Banh Xeo was on a different level. It was probably the size of a cheesesteak! Unlike traditional restaurants that overfill the Vietnamese crepe with bean sprouts, this one had a lot of pork and shrimp, very tasty. Beware, the dish is served with a tremendous amount of vegetables that you will probably not finish.\n\nMy Vietnamese iced coffee finally arrived after my meal was almost finished. Not sure what took so long, but the server apologized. It was ready to drink in a plastic cup with a straw, no drip cup necessary.\n\nGood company and good food helped ease the soreness from running ten miles, until I had to get up. I had a good experience at Le Viet and will be back soon!",

  "text": "The menu reads really interesting, some really interesting sandwich concepts, but they don't eat like they read. The sandwich ideas are awesome, the execution on them just doesn't hold up. Regular deli turkey on the turkey sandwich? It says citrus sous vide, but I don't taste it. Maybe I was expecting something more, but I wasn't expecting regular old deli meat at this sort of craft style sandwich shop. Maybe I came in with incorrect expectations of what Tasso was going to be. The bread, and let me preface this by saying LOVE crusty baguettes, was hard to eat. This bread would be perfect with some soup, but not in a sandwich. The roof of my mouth was destroyed after the sandwich, but r takes more than that to get me to put down a sandwich so I continued.. The rest of the toppings were good, but nothing amazing. The pickle was drastically, like somebody messed up on the amounts of the brine, salty.. so much that I couldn't even eat it. The side of mojito cucumber salad was plain and boring and not seasoned at all. Somebody forgot the seasoning or vinaigrette. Wasted 4.00 on that side, I took one bite and just put it to the side. Thankfully.. the meal was saved by the cheapest, insignificant addition to the meal, the popcorn. The popcorn (self serve) was great. I'm guessing curry or garam masala is the spice, but it's a great snack to have with a sandwich. \n\nI hope they work on the execution in the kitchen and shore up some of the recipes, I'd love to come back and try a different sandwich! They do read well, I hope some of the others have a bit better execution.",

My friend and I were getting hungry and I've seen signs all over for Ponzio's and thought it would be a great time to check it out.\n\nOur first server was a little..odd. But she had to leave half-way through and the next server was ok, but she was semi staring at us once in awhile. This was about 5pm on a Saturday and it was packed. \n\nTo start out, the green bean fries were tasty and the philly cheesesteak spring rolls were super hot, crispy and flavorful. Being as hungry as I was, and knowing I can't actually eat that much I wanted something I could easily heat up the next day as well. Answer- chicken parm with a side of angel hair pasta. Huge portion! Everything was cooked perfectly with a really nice tomato sauce. My friend got a Reuben and loved every bite.  \n\nThe menu was large with a copious amount of options. I was deciding between shrimp scampi, strip steak, blackened chicken wrap.. I was on the point of being hangry, but the chicken parm hit the spot.",

I know this is seafood in Nashville but it was literally the best food experience I had while visiting. \n\nMy friend and I arrived from a long flight from NY and had a couple cocktails at Skull's Raimnbow Room before heading over. Yet, Maci our waitress, sold me on this gin, blueberry, egg white cocktail, called Negative Space. Mind Blowing! It's like this girl could read my mind. I am a sucker for gin and egg white cocktail. I could not have been happier. \n\nThe restaurant itself felt modern, clean and spacious. I like to not be elbow to elbow when I am splurging on a meal. \n\nWe started with a dozen oysters. The oyster menu was perfect. It explained the flavor notes for each, of course some of the obscure ones were sold out. Our dinner was pretty late. I would say come as early as you can for the full menu. Also remember to check the boxes for mignonettesauce, horseradish, cocktail sauce and lemon. This was the best way to start the meal. \n\nThey suggested 4-5 plates to share. We ordered 4 after the oysters and it was a lot. But happy we got to try so many of the dishes. \n\nPoppy's Caviar - was a delicious and light dish \nOctopus salad - So good with the grapes, avocado and crunchy pepitas\nCrab Dip -  A really meaty one of the dishes, rich and comforting. Loved the cast iron skillet it was served in\nSmoked Trout - a lovely layering of flavors. With the potatoes it became a lot heavier too\n\nWe ended up taking some of the crab dip and smoked trout home and it made for the perfect morning chilled breakfast. \n\nThanks to our lovely waitress for helping us through the menu and making our experience so enjoyable.

Yummy!I can never just have one slice so I can eat pizza relatively guilt free when I order basically anything on thin crust. My family are not calorie counters so they like all the flavors. The kids like the Hawaiian the most. Husband is a fan of the gourmet garlic chicken.",

This city has so many great cheesesteak joints that it's easy to judge if it's going to be good or not but this spot hit it out of the park. Got a chicken cheesesteak, and they use real marinated chicken breast which was deliciously awesome, and it was huge!!! I refuse to eat the chicken steak that other places sell, stuff is fake! A plus was that they sell beer too so I got a Lagunitas IPA to wash it down. Definitely will be back to try the regular cheesesteak which looked awesome as well. I also like that they chop the steak. Definitely top 5 steak i've ever had in philly hands down.",

  "text": "Finally made the trip to the unsuspecting spot where Perennial resides. What a gem!  Based in the bottom of a refurbished Coke factory that now houses loft apartments, this place is awesome. As soon as we walked in, the bartenders gave us a friendly greeting and asked if it was our first time - indeed it was!  She then went through the menu and all the beer options available that day.  My husband and I both opted for a flight of beer to find out which one we liked best. My winner was Midnight Rambler, a dark full-bodied Belgian Stout. Mmmmm, mmmmm, good.\n\nTo pair with our beers we ordered the charcuterie plate and the pumpkin humus. Both were spectacular but the pumpkin humus blew my mind! I am a fan of all things pumpkin and it makes so much sense to use it in humus. It also came sprinkled with pomegranate seeds on top which gave each bite a tart, acidity to it. I am drooling right now just thinking about it. \n\nOur experience at Perennial could not have been any better. The beer, the food, the service all five star worthy. Oh and we got to chatting with a group of home brewers who traveled up from Memphis to try the place, very cool.   Got some great tips to use for our future home brews.  This place is a winner and we can't wait to go back to try and get our hands on some of their famous Abraxas beer next month!!",

Amy carefully, and with great surgical skill, had to cut the tail bit by bit until all the damage had been removed.

Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.  If we go back, I would like to try the fried green tomatoes.  That is IF we go back.",

  "text": "I came here for my 17th birthday with my two best friends and family. We stayed here for one night. We got two rooms which were connected through a lockable door. My outlook on the experience was that it was good, great with friends, but overall just good if I wasn't taking into account that my friends and family were with me. \n\nI'm not a very picky person, most things I just go with the flow with. However, having said that, there was definitely a few things I can talk about that was negative with the actual hotel rooms. For one, the sheets were awful. I am never picky about sheets but they were stiff and felt like paper. Another issue is the thin walls. We were able to hear conversations down the hall from people in the hallway as if our door was open. At one point I went over and checked because it sounded so crystal clear. My friends who used the shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner that came with the hotel room, said they all felt the same, just dyed different colors. Overall, the room experience isn't great. Luckily, you're not spending majority of your time there, or at least we weren't.\n\nNow, the views. This place is beautiful. I think everyone who has been here can attest and agree to one thing: this is a beautiful resort. The waterfalls, the roses, the greenery, the hanging and twinkling lights - it's all so very beautiful. \n\nAs far as options to eat in the resort, we went to a pizzeria place I can't quite remember the name of, but it was pretty good! We also had Carvel and Auntie Ann's for dessert and that all tasted splendid. For breakfast we ate at Auntie Ann's and Cinnabon. The lines were pretty bad but nothing like the marketplace line. They moved relatively fast, though, and the food was hot.\n\nWe spent majority of our time at the waterpark, which is huge and tons of fun. The rides are a-plenty and we swam for hours on end! Only complaint here is the lockers are, you guessed it, way too overpriced. The smallest locker, a \"medium\" is 12 dollars, and they don't accept coins. You're best just hiding your stuff like we did.\n\nIn summary, though, I believe this place is way too overpriced. I feel bad about how much my parents paid - don't get me wrong, I had a wonderful time because I always will when I'm with friends and family, but if I had come here alone I would have been immensely dissatisfied.",

The staff is super kind and has even remembered who we are and what we order (shout out to Angie). We like the 4 for 4 option because its cheap and a lot of food. They always have fresh baked cookies too, which I am a sucker for. \n\nSee you next Sunday, Wendy's!",

We ordered a washer, dryer and refrigerator for our new home in late July, 2020.  $4,100!   OK, COVID has delayed supplies, I get that but the communication is nonexistent.  No update on the fridge and we're in late August, it took me to drive to the store to get someone to check.  The washer and dyer was finally delivered but the washer is broken.  After two failed attempts to fix it, they tell me they will not take it back.  That they need to \"re-build\" it until it works.  The repair tech Gerhard's sent recommended that we have it exchanged as he was puzzled with why it's broken.  Gerhard's refuses to exchange it saying the manufacturer won't let them return it.  I said that's now their problem.    Please go to Best Buy of Home Depot.",

The Hot N Sour Soup and the Crab Rangoon were both adequate and typical of any strip mall carryout Chinese place. The Lo Mein was probably the worst I've ever had. The noodles were overcooked and tasteless. The beef was stringy. The pork appeared to be reddish in an alarmingly undercooked way. I took literally two bites of this and threw it away. I would never go back.",

He said no because the purchase already went through but told us we can use it next time. I thought okay that's fine we'll probably come back! \nWhen our grilled cheese with added bacon came out it was SUPER dry and TINY... there were about 2 pieces of dry bacon in there cut into tiny strips of four to fit the equally tiny sandwich. Tater tots were good, but not worth the price.\nI won't be going back to use that coupon :(",

The prices here are really reasonable and they have a good selection of stuff to order. \n\nIf the roasted meats hanging in the window are not something you are interested in you can also order some of the other stuff they prepare in the back. \n\nThe best thing about this restaurant is the service. While the waiters here may not have the smiling faces of waiters from most American restaurants, the speed is incredibly fast. For each of the times I went to Ting Wong's,  it takes the server usually 3-5 minutes after I place my order to bring me my food.

Always get them. \nBeer boiled shrimp\nOyster Shooters\nBaked climbs\nCalamari - they are known for their calamari.\n\nThe staff is always great and usually cute girls. Prices are good and the view of the harbor is awesome.

Met some friends for dinner last evening and were seated at a nice booth in the dining room. Ordered cocktails, which took much longer than expected to arrive. We ordered some of their small, shared plates after we ordered the drinks, and those arrived before the drinks showed up. \n\nWe ordered the breads and spreads, the burrata, two of the bloody beet salads, and a cheese plate to start. I highly recommend the bloody beet salad- it had a great yogurt sauce and was just really light and fresh. I could have done without some of the things on the breads and spreads platter- the chick pea fries were a little soggy, but there was an interesting kale fritter thing with a yogurt sauce that was very good. The burrata dish was very unique so props for thinking outside the box! I could have done with less of the toppings and more of the burrata itself. I think the proportions were a bit off. The bread it was served on was basic and forgettable, but the \"butternut peperonata\" that it was served with was delicious!\n\nI ordered the shrimp & grits, which were good, except that the proportions were off again. Massive grit cakes, and only 4 shrimp. The short ribs were delicious, very tender and, the veggies were great. A friend ordered the seared tuna served on a pesto risotto. The tuna itself was overcooked, but she said the risotto was excellent. The other three ordered sandwiches and raved about them. I think that might be the way to go. Everybody, except myself, had been there several times before, and were raving about the open faced greens sandwich. \n\nNot sure I'd go back, but now I'm very interested in trying out their Philly location to compare!",

I also really like the steamed egg custard buns (sweet, like dessert).\n\nFrom the \"regular\" menu, the special Chinese broccoli and salt and pepper pork ribs were quite good.  The ribs could have been cut into smaller pieces, and were fairly greasy, but the flavor was delicious.\n\nThe only dish I thought was a little \"off\" was the chow fun noodles- seemed a little bland.\n\nService was excellent, and the food was prepared quickly and steaming hot.  I definitely will be \"bookmarking\" and returning to CaiE's.",

  "text": "I have never written a negative review before, but highly recommend parents research this organization before sending children to their camps or other activities. We attended a children's birthday party at the ranch, and while Sadie, the owner of Rancho Palomino, was fine, there was a belligerent woman cursing, yelling, calling parents stupid, and otherwise acting inappropriate in front of children. This woman apparently owns the property where Rancho Palomino recently moved. After this interaction, I emailed Sadie requesting a refund of my daughter's summer camp tuition (my daughter had not yet attended the camp, so there were no services performed). Sadie apologized for the woman's behavior, who she explained had been dealing with some stress and drinking too much. However, Sadie refused to refund any part of the tuition. I explained I did not feel safe with my daughter attending a camp on a property where a woman acted like that in front of children. Sadie has continued to refuse any refund despite repeated requests. Thus, while the camp may have at one time provided a good experience for SB kids, the business practices of the organization are such that I would not recommend purchasing any camps or activities.",

They are not the only body shop in h-town.\n\nMy dad told me to have it towed to a different local body shop, one he's used before.\n\nSo, when he arrives, I ask the older tow truck guy to take me there.

I told him a few times: no, let's just go straight to the other place. But he wouldn't let up. So, we went there, then I had to talk with the owner, had to tell him over and over: No, I just want to take it where my dad told me to take it.\n\nIt was so ridiculous!!!!\n\nI felt so taken advantage of, i was at their mercy, vulnerable, had no control over the situation.

  "text": "Went for lunch and ordered the chicken somen noodle soup and then split the honeymoon roll ;), dynamite roll, and kani kamakaze\n\nThe chicken somen soup tasted bland and was cold within 30 seconds of being on the table.\nThe dynamite roll is just a bad idea. Nothing about this dish went together, didnt finish\nThe kani kamikaze could have been good but the honey sauce did not have the proper punch to offset the spicy crab.\n\nMy girlfriend is a bit more bashful than me when it comes to roll, she played it safe with the smoked salmon and spicy tuna. After tasting these rolls I was relieved to see that I did not misfire on my order....the food is just bad.\n\nOsaka seems to want to position itself as a more upscale option to Houka Houka (another Chestnut hill sushi spot), and the ambiance speaks to this. However the food is actually worse than Houka Houka and the prices are higher. I would advise they actually serve a quality of food that matches the presentation and then maybe I would return. Until then Houka Houka is definitely the place to eat sushi in chestnut hill!",

  "text": "So we came in for my moms birthday because my sister works in the city. There were 3 of us. We all got gel manicures and my mom also got one of their spa pedicures which she really enjoyed. My mom loved all of her services. My moms technician was Rose and was excellent. I would recommend people ask for Rose. However my sister and I had Janine and Sandy for our gel manicures and they are both nice women however I would not recommend them. We both chose nude nail polish colors mine was a cream champagne color and my sister chose a white. Mine went on totally clear as if I had out on a clear coat but Sandy agreed to do a top coat of a different color so that it would show up more. I chose a light pink and was happy with the end result although it was a little sloppy on the sides and there was nail polish on the skin. My sister who got the white polish was also unhappy with her nails because she felt it was too clear and looked like a top coat rather than a gel polish. She did say something to her technician and asked for another coat so it would show up more and Janine said she did not need it. When we both went to the manager to ask if she could have another coat of a different color like I did he said something like if you weren't happy you should've said something earlier because now Janine was doing a pedicure. We said she did say something to Janine when she was doing her nails. He said we could come back another to fix it which to me was just not going to cut it. We have a luxury nail spa that we usually go to and this place just did not cut it based on the quality of service we are used to. We won't be back and we were not impressed. They made my nail bleed and I was poked with a tool and it broke the skin. When I'm paying this much I expect much better service and more gentle care!",

  "text": "Went here on a cheap date night. We started with flaming saganaki for a appetizer, which was delicious. Reminiscent of fondue, it was a nice serving of hot, Greek cheese and wine set ablaze. The flavors, salty and tangy, were fantastic. The appetizer came with two pita breads, which was not enough for the generous portion of cheese. Unfortunately our dining experience went downhill from there. It was a Tuesday and there were at most two other small parties, yet our beverages weren't offered to be refilled until towards the end of the meal. We would have asked for more pita bread for our appetizer, had our server been anywhere to be found. Our Greek pizza arrived after quite a wait. The thin crust was not too thin nor too thick and was the best part of the pizza. The cheese was overly abundant (way too much) and the other toppings scant. Red onion, bell pepper, beef gyro, tomatoes, and kalamata olives sounds yummy, but in such small quantity didn't give much flavor. I was confused as to a single dolmade placed in the middle of the pizza. I love dolmades, but just one on a pizza? Odd. In the end, the Greek pizza was completely lacking in the flavors I love about Greek food. Given the slow service, I was able to fully \"appreciate\" the \"interesting decor.\" Well, someone definitely loves artificial greenery in cheap hanging baskets. Red vinyl tablecloths provide additional divey feel. The appetizer alone would get four stars. Service and pizza way less. So I will call it two. Not likely to return.",

Enter Thai Square. \n\nI didn't have high expectations, but it's quickly become our go-to when stressed/tired/boiling pasta becomes an inconceivably stressful burden. It helps that it's a family place where the proprietors are super nice (and they used to be involved with Erawan, which in itself is a really solid Philly Thai option).\n\nTheir food is pretty darn good. Among the best Pad Thai I've had in Philly - 11 bucks for chicken/pork/veggie, and their spice levels are legitimately hot and not fake/diluted hot, which I'm a fan of. Drunken noodles and eggplant dishes are also consistently good. There are some other things that are pricier and which I haven't sampled (duck, seafood based dishes). I'll stick to my cheapish noodles. \n\nClosed on Mondays, but open every other day of the week. We're working our way up to the free entree currently with one of their rewards cards, only three more stamps to go.",

We like our poke chunky so this place was good for that. Their fish isn't diced up fine and they didn't use the smallest scooper they could find.",

The crowd never really showed up but the service was still VERY slow because they could not keep enough chicken wings cooked.  We had to wait for 2 batches of wings to be cooked before being served but once we received the food it was all good.\n\nOne thing I noticed that I didn't like was the first server you encountered was eating food off the line which was not sanitary or healthy for customers.  From my table I could see her taking pieces of fish eating them ... this happened more than once.  She was obviously trying to hide it but not very well.  I don't think the management would allow this behavior but it happened anyway ... she also gave some food to the girl who was learning the register when she came to socialize during some down time",

IDK, but for some reason that ticked him off. Anyway he brought my out Dhal that was thick, so I spread it on the Naan. The he didn't offer us desert and gave us our check. I didn't feel like we were being kicked out though because we sat there for a long time before we got the check. Sooo to sum it up the food was excellent, but the service was a little lacking.",

When you got 10-18 people looking for a place to eat its amazing that this place is adaptable to accommodation.\n\nThis time I had a great pasta that was properly oiled and graced with proportionate amounts of tomatoes, herbs, and feta cheese that was just a great meal. \n\nWe also had those fried zucchini sticks with the mozzarella atop. but it was obviously from a prepared and refrigerated mix, since it melted far to slow. Hand grinding is usually thinner imparts some warmth and melts faster. That's how i know.\n\nThe drinks came out in good time, or waters were always filled, and the waitress was very nice even though we continue to invite our difficult friend. He makes for laughs and assures me that our hosts \"earn\" their keep. He's not mean, he is challenging. \n\nAnyways while the huge menu, and service are very good there are things that keep the restaurant from reaching the top echelon. Perhaps a higher end selection or more paired items. I think a menu revamp should be in order. Surprisingly this has a lot of  sub conscious behavioral affects on people.",

The day we picked it up was quite wet and nasty and Ben suggested that I bring it back for its cleanup and detail on a better day.

I ordered the Nashville chicken bone in hot chicken wings. They definitely weren't hot but seasoned well. They are served with pickles which is awesome and goes with the \"Nashville\" name.\nAs a table we also had the Coney Island poutine and a Meatzorilla pizza. \nPoutine was good but just like most stacked fries or nachos the top layer has all the toppings then you have a ton of naked friends/chips left.\nThe Roadstone Meatzorilla pizza was great! Loaded up with meat and cheese. I would recommend getting it \"well done\" if you like a crisper bite. Otherwise the pizza was great! \nAlso had a blood orange sour from their tap, Five foot freak. It was good but just seemed to be missing \"something\". \nMy only complaint is that they offer certain apps at $3.33 between certain hours. They have the list inside each menu. After our group finally agreed on a few apps the waiter came back as said \"I was just informed we aren't doing the discount on weekends\". There was no days listed on the app list only times. I'd recommend they remove the advertisement during the weekend or list the days that these items are offered. \nThe server did ask if we had a Sahm's card and explained what it was but never offered to sign any of us up even after we all said we were first timers ‍",

My dining partner and I split the roast beef and pork  sandwiches.   We ordered combos which means you want it with sharp provolone.   Fries and drinks are not included.

Without question the best pizza outside of Europe.  If you don't love it you are a cretin.",

And what can I say about the martinis .. they certainly don't skimp on the alcohol provided in them. Overall, we will be back!",

  "text": "The story you are about to read is true.\n\n7:22 pm. My partner and I are in town moving in a convention. As we head through the warehouse district looking for our hotel, I can't help but think of home. The streets in this part of town are a maze of one way streets. Coming from the convention center requires us to drive around the block before we can approach the hotel going the right direction. Fortunately our GPS gets us through.\n\nThe driveway has enough room for maybe four cars if everyone is considerate. The lobby is small, but the employee behind the front desk is nice enough. She gives us our room keys and lets us know that the parking lot is across the street. (We don't find out until much later that parking is $18 per day in these parts)\n\nI'm on the first floor in a small apartment like room. There is an efficiency kitchen complete with refrigerator, stove, microwave and dishwasher. A door leads back to the bedroom, closet and bathroom area. The room is clean and tidy but one small piece of advice. If you are staying in an odd numbered room on the first floor, your room is at street level next to the sidewalk. The curtain blocks out the peepers but doesn't do much for the street noise and occasional gang of revelers wandering from one watering hole to the next.\n\nAll in all, not a bad place to stay. I've been in much worse, but also much better. Convenient for a convention (three blocks away) but a bit of a hike for the French Quarter if you're here to party.",

I saw that it was pre-toasted and sitting under the warmer with 20 other pieces. Would have rather waited another minute for fresh, warm toast. Also, both meals only came with one piece of toast.

  "text": "Edley's was recommended by a local during our visit to Nashville. Having grown up on the south, this is hands down THE BEST BBQ EVER!  \n\nWhen we arrived, their power had been out and had just barely come on. They had told us that it might be a little bit of a wait to cook our food and to pay. However we had our food within 10 minutes.\n\nI had the special of the day, which was a barbecue pork sandwich with grilled peaches, called Sweet Georgia Brown.  My husband had the hot chicken platter. Both were amazing. The plug of coleslaw had an amazing sweet vinegar taste, nothing I have ever had before. The grits casserole were amazing with the Gouda cheese base, jalapeños, pepper and onion. They were definitely a must try. The baked beans melted in your mouth.  We also had drinks from the bar. My husband had a Mohito which was quite tasty. But my bourbon cocktail was something that made you feel like you were sitting on an old porch in a rocking chair, sipping from an old Mason jar. To end our night, we shared a piece of pecan pie which tasted just as good as my mom's homemade pie.\n\nNot only was the food absolutely delicious, but the service was quick, even with their power outage, friendly and above superior. In fact, when we went back up to pay, the manager whoever was in charge, told us that we did not need to pay and thanked us for our patients. I would have gladly have paid twice as much as what our final bill was. It was something I would definitely return to and would recommend to all locals and anyone passing by the area. You do not want to miss this taste of southern deliciousness heaven.",

I drove over two hours to try and purchase a vehicle here and what they promised on the phone and what happened when I got to the dealership were two different things.   \n\nFirst they removed the window sticker from the car and tried to tell me the MSRP was different.  Secondly they claim to honor USAA certified car buying pricing and they flat out refused to honor the certificate that I presented them.  Finally, I tried to negotiate with them because we had driven so far and when they came back they made it look like they gave me a deeper discount but changed the price on the car again.  \n\nI found my experience there as a veteran insulting as they treated me like I was some kind of idiot.  The salesman even called the next day and asked if we had bought a car yet.  I told him no because we spent all evening driving back.  I told him I have never been treated so poorly and manipulated by a car dealer in my life.  He said he was sorry they couldn't earn our business.  Folks, they didn't try to earn my business.

In Nashville?!  YES PLZ!  The turkey burger was REALLY good.  I say this as a turkey burger snob.  I really feel that more don't do it right.  Braiz got it.  It comes with Adobo Mayo, but I also added the Chimmichuri and WHAT A COMBO!  Their Jerk Chili is some seriously good Chili.  Very different from the normal stuff you see everywhere.  One of the big surprises is the Buffalo Alfredo pasta.  Who knew?!  This is why I give 5 stars to this place.  The Chef and his creativity.  \n\nA couple of negatives: Décor.  Definitly needs some work.  But I do NOT do to a place to look around.  If I were to do that, I wouldn't expect much out of the food.  But there are lots of folks who do, so Braiz could work on this to ensure a good, and solid customer base.  One food related gripe.  The salad.  My wife's side salad was Caesar.  When you order a Caesar, You expect a nice bed of Romaine, with shaved Romano or parmesan, croutons and dressing.  This hit all those points, except for one.  Iceberg lettuce.  My Turkey burger had Romaine lettuce on it, so I'm not sure why the Caesar salad did not.  Minor, but valid.\n\nI still feel that the heart of any 5 star rating rests with the chef.  Obviously other factors play in, and the couple negatives I have mentioned are minor enough to me that they do NOT overshadow the eclectic brilliance of the Chef.\n\nKudos to Braiz!",

You can choose as many toppings as you like for less than $12.\n\nThe price can't be beat.  As others have mentioned, it's a bit of a Subway for pizza.. but with better toppings.  \n\nThe crust itself was good, but a bit on the chewy side.  Which is still better than the ultra thin soggy mess you get at a certain other 'famous' chain.\n\nThey're licenced too, and offer a handful of beers and whatnot.\n\nI'd go back I think.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I tried City Winery for a Griffin House show in mid-November one Wednesday night. Mostly we wanted to see the new concert behemoth of SoBro (I still hate the name SoBro). \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere. This place is beyond superlatives beautiful and tasteful, all at the same time. They've made it obvious it's a nicer place without overwhelming the concert-goer seeking to just enjoy a show with a nice glass of wine. They'll start making their own wine here in 2015 so we'll be interested to go back and see even more of this gorgeous venue.\n\nThe wine. I'm just starting to understand different types of wines and an amateur at best in describing what I want in a wine. The waiter was well-trained and did not lead us astray when we were making our selection from the multiple wines on tap, available for a glass, and those available by a bottle. We tried a couple of these before we left and weren't disappointed. \n\nThe food. It was good, not great. I had the leg of lamb pizza, which was tasty with a good mix of spices, crunchy pine nuts, and melty cheese. She got the Chicken Fricassee which was good but reminded me of much less expensive items I've had elsewhere. The food was tasty and good to munch on during a show or for dinner. I'm probably going to have dinner elsewhere the next time we visit City Winery, however.\n\nPros: Amazing building and predictably great wine selection.\n\nCons: Food was kind of expensive and didn't blow me away. The parking was pretty terrible. They offered paid valet or you can park on the streets, which is not the best option in this neighborhood.\n\nOverall: This a relaxing, romantic place to take a date for a concert. You will win friends  and influence people if you bring someone from out of town in for a concert. If you can stand the parking situation and high-priced food, you'll be elated to make this spot one of your regulars!",

  "text": "After ten years as Executive Chef for the Century Hospitality Group, Chef Paul Shufelt decided it was time to start up a restaurant of his own. The Workshop Eatery officially opened a couple weeks ago in The Mosaic Centre, Canada's largest net-zero commercial building. Choosing to open up in a sustainable building definitely poses its challenges, but supporting local producers, sustainability, and using seasonal produce are concepts important to Chef Paul. \n\nThe Workshop Eatery is located in the far south neighborhood of Summerside, which can be a fair drive for many in Edmonton. But once you enter the building you're greeted by an open space and living wall, which shows how unique and beautiful the Mosaic Centre really is. As for the restaurant, you're greeted into a space that is warm, rustic and inviting. I love the open concept and the visibility of the kitchen - there's nothing to hide! \n\nThroughout the different seasons, the menu will consist of roughly 20 staple dishes and a different feature each day. What makes the menu seasonal will be the different accompaniments and sides to a main dish. If you're ever wondering what's on the menu on a particular day, just check the website! It's amazing that they will be updating their online menu daily! \n\nWe started off our meal with a couple of appetizers, first up was the Arancini ($12). The arancini at Workshop changes daily, and the \"New York Deli\" arancini with deli meats, a balsamic tomato smear, and Nefiss Lazizz Olive Oil was the feature for the day. These fried risotto balls had a golden, crisp exterior, and broke open to reveal a creamy mix of risotto, green peas, and small morsels of meat. I personally prefer my arancini to be rich and cheesy, so these arancini didn't quite deliver for me. \n\nNext up came the Chicken Liver Parfait ($11) served in a small mason jar with crostinis made from Bon Ton Bakery's Cranberry Raisin Nut Bread. The liver was whipped with a mousse-like texture and topped with a port and Saskatoon berry jam. It was a perfect balance between sweet and savoury, and I loved the different textures that the crostini added to the mixture.\n\nOur last starter for the meal was the Duck Carpaccio ($17) featuring Moosewood Acres cured duck breast, pickled shiitakes, carrots, daikon, a soy reduction and blood orange vinaigrette. I really enjoyed the fragrant orange paired with the duck, and the tang of the vinaigrette, but found that the dish was much too salty. Typically a carpaccio dish features meat that is extremely thinly sliced or pounded thin, but the duck in this carpaccio was thickly sliced. The thick slice combined with the soy reduction was quite salty, so with some adjustments to the cut and seasoning, I would really enjoy this dish!\n\nJust like the arancini, The Workshop Eatery has a feature dish each evening. On the night of our visit Tangle Ridge Lamb Chops were being served with a butternut squash, corn and bacon hash. The lamb chops were moist and tender, and looked beautiful against the brightly coloured hash. The hash itself was naturally sweet but lacking in smokiness which we expected from the bacon. As it turns out, we didn't find much bacon in the hash either, so that could have accounted for the discrepancy. \n\nFor myself I ordered the Duck Duck Couscous (how fun is that to say?!) ($32) which featured beautifully seared Moosewood Acres duck breast on a bed of warm couscous with raisins, almonds, pickled cherries and vanilla parsnip puree. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium, and the lightly sweet couscous was a great companion to the duck. The parsnip puree was also a delightful addition to the dish, and complemented both components on the plate. Although I love lamb, the duck was definitely the winner for me and I would happily order it again. \n\nWhen it came down to the desserts, I was torn between two options. The panna cotta at The Workshop Eatery is made with the rooftop honey and would have been my first choice, but I couldn't resist the Croissant Bread Pudding ($9). The flaky croissant pieces are paired with white chocolate and cranberry, giving this dessert some tart notes to balance the sweet. Topped with a generous scoop of Pinocchio's cinnamon ice cream, this was a comforting dessert that I would eat again. \n\nTaken as a whole, we had a great dinner at The Workshop Eatery: our dishes were good and the service was attentive. If there's one thing I love about The Workshop Eatery, it's their commitment to sustainability and supporting local producers. Their decision to move into the Mosaic Centre means that the drive to their restaurant is long and far for many patrons, but the principles of the building align with the values of the restaurant. It's great to see so many local farmers mentioned throughout the menu, and I think it will be interesting to see how things shift once the growing season in Edmonton comes around.",

When we asked to speak to a manager, the manager looked at us and never approached our table. \n\nThis establishment refused to serve us after waiting for several minutes with no service.

Eggs perfect consistency, although the Hollandiase sauce started separating by the time I got home. I did have a 15 min drive and the food was probably sitting for a good 10mins before I picked up too. \n\nThe avocado toast was 1 piece of toast, with a really meager smear of avocado(like the amount that you would spread for butter on toast). The turkey bacon and egg was good. But that was it. A little lacking for the price that you pay for it. \n\nThe strawberry French toast cost $1.50 more than the regular French toast but all I got was some sliced strawberries. She had asked if I wanted fresh strawberries or the strawberry sauce, so I knew what I was getting for the fresh strawberries but I thought there would be more pizazz. On the bright side, the French toast was yummy.",

  "text": "Fish is a hard sell in Alberta.  Pride in Alberta beef (mediocre in my opinion) and distance from the coast play a part in neglecting this healthy protein option.  When I received a great coupon for this particular Joey's, I was reminded that we do like our fish in this house.  We intended to go there with another couple but sickness meant that we were only two that Saturday.\n\nIf location is everything, Joey's is at a disadvantage.  It's hard to see from the street - I recommend using a GPS to locate.  The entrance is also difficult to access because of a concrete walled patio (useless on a cold winter night.  Once inside, the restaurant is roomy, well-lit with a large screen TV on the north wall for those addicted to Hockey Night in Canada.  The staff are friendly and service is initially quick.  My only quibble with the service is that I had to go to the kitchen to ask for coffee and dessert when we were finished our mains.  We never know how we feel about dessert until we finish the first course.  However, the owner served coffee/tea and dessert as well as took our payment.  The waiting staff seemed to be busy with cleaning up, which made us fell slightly rushed.\n\nHow was the food you ask?  My wife had the halibut with mashed potatoes, pronouncing the mash great but the halibut too dry.  I must take her word for it because I learned to dislike mashed because that was the only way my father wanted potatoes served and because I ordered the endless shrimp plate.  I was full with the single serving so I couldn't sample my wife's halibut (which disappeared despite the bad review) or eat any more shrimp.  For dessert, we shared the mud pie, delicious.\n\nThe coupon worked because we plan another visit some time in the future.",

  "text": "Not one to write reviews but this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Service and food were terrible. We were sat quickly on the rooftop tonight which was nice. We were sat a table with no salt and pepper or silverware just menus.. okay.. so my boyfriend and I start browsing the menu and pick drinks and our food since no one came up to us for 10 minutes. Our waiter comes by with water and drops a drink menu then runs away. Awesome. Wait another 10 minutes and he finally comes back. My boyfriend orders a beer they didn't have which was fine so he got something different. I ordered a lemonade and they were out of it so I ordered a root beer instead and what do you know they're out of that too. No big deal I just got a coke. We order our food and wait for our drinks. 5 minutes goes by, no drinks but our appetizer of calamari came out quickly and the food runner just drops it. Mind you we still have no plates or silverware but we eat it anyway. Calamari was super plain the menu said it came with stuff on it and it literally came with nothing but marinara. Then our food comes out. I got a ny strip steak and my boyfriend got a pineapple chicken sandwich. When I say Applebee's could of made better food I'm not kidding. I had to go up to the server who was completely non existent this whole time and ask for salt and pepper after the hostess finally brought silverware. Not once did he ask if we needed anything or how anything was. If we wanted another drink. Nothing. I waitress for a living and could see it was busy but that's literally no excuse for how horrible the service was. Both the tables next to us were complaining that he wasn't acknowledging them at all. Only positive was the food coming out quickly but it wasn't even good at all. Definitely will never be back a waste of 65 dollars.",

  "text": "I know that I do not need to give any review for this chain restaurant, because I have never wanted to go here anyway. However, we decided to go to this place with my in-laws because we thought it could please everyone (adults and children) and it was one of the few family style restaurants in the West side of town. We have been avoiding dining at Olive Garden for at least 7 years, and now I know we should have gone to another Italian restaurant. \n\nTheir menu is quite extensive and very similar to other Italian restaurants, such as calamari, pizza, spaghetti, salad, chicken or pork scaloppini etc. Everything sounded good in the menu and the pictures looked very enticing.  However, nothing tasted right, and in almost all of their entrees, they have added cheese to their dishes which means extra creamy and FAT. YUCK! Their  kids cheese pizza did not taste good either. The only thing that is fresh is their Garden Salad. The service is good. The price is not cheap for the quality of their food. \n\nWe will cross out Olive Garden from the list...FOREVER.",

  "text": "Suppa had one of the more interesting offerings for Restaurant Week, which is why my wife and I found here on a Friday evening in August 2015. The restaurant had seating outside and being a nice evening, we preferred that option.\n\nLooking through the menu, we decided that one of us would go for the Restaurant week offering while the other of us would order ala carte from the menu. It was nice to have that option and I think not all restaurants have that option when a RW is in progress. The RW menu we chose consisted of crab fritters, mac n' cheese, ricotta cavatelli, and choice of a dessert item. It was nice of them to also include a beverage in the offering. From the ala carte menu, we went for the duck poutine and the cubano melt sandwich. \n\nThe first comment is that the food took a long time to come out. The restaurant was quite busy on a Friday evening and we could only see one server doing the rounds. The first dish to come out were the crab fritters. They were crispy and hot but as my wife puts it, there did not seem to be any crab meat in it. I thought I had found some traces of crab when I first took a bite but I could certainly see what my wife was saying. The next two dishes to come out were the mac n' cheese and the duck poutine. Both dishes were tasty and as the poutine is not something I have often had before, I enjoyed the novelty of the dish. What surprised us were the huge portions. Even though I was very hungry, I decided to not finish all of my duck poutine and leave some room for the other things we had ordered. The cubano melt sandwich was also very nice. The bread was well toasted and the ham, pulled pork and cheese all went nicely together. The cavatelli pasta was quite flavorful too. Finally, when it came to the dessert, we were so full, we just had a cupcake to go and had it at home. \n\nPositives:\n1. Interesting and eclectic menu.\n2. Huge portions - I could have a full lunch based on what was leftover from the meal and even then there were some leftovers.\n3. Reasonable prices - For what was being served, prices were reasonable.\n\nNegatives:\n1. Pretty slow service: We got in at around 9:20 p.m. and left at around 11 p.m. Certainly we were enjoying the evening and lingered on but then a part of the delay can be explained by how long it took for things to come out.\n2. Waters were not refiled promptly. In one instance, my wife requested a glass of water and the waiter, absent-mindedly perhaps, just left her with a glass full of ice. It wasn't until another 5 mins. or so after we could hail the waiter that we were able to have our glasses filled.\n\nOverall, this is the kind of place I would be very excited to have in my neighborhood. I wouldn't have the hassle of having to drive and search for parking and that would make it easy for me just to swing by for perhaps a sandwich or maybe one of their brunch items over the weekend. It is certainly a place I would like to return to.",

  "text": "My husband and I have lived here for almost 4 months.  We really like the apartment that we are in (they call it a townhome), but we do have some complaints about the neighborhood.  There are usually lots of children running around with their parents nowhere to be seen.  There have been times I've been woken in the middle of the night by people being loud, but that has settled some since the neighbors from two doors down moved.  There are lots of dogs in this neighborhood and lots of people that let their cats out during the day.  It is a gated community, however the gate is broken most of the time and be ready to have a lot of people call your phone when trying to enter the gate.  The system allows guests to look up names and have the system call that person to buzz them in the gate.  We get at least one call a day from this.  They have two pools: one is an indoor salt water pool (a little too warm for me) that stays open year round and an outdoor pool that is average size for an apartment complex.  Neither are usually very crowded. If we had it to do over again we would hold out for one of the townhomes on the back of the property on top of the hill.  It seems quieter and more quaint in that area.  Oh and if you have AT&T the service here sucks.  Not sure about any other carriers though.",

The hollandaise sauce was disgusting, not even sure it was hollandaise sauce more like white cream poured over the eggs.  The eggs were the size of quarters, not kidding and didn't even think they could be that tiny....The english muffin was soggy and the potatoes were hard and bland..all in all a pretty poor experience. \n\nThe Good:\nService - A\nI spoke with the manager regarding the my situation and he was more than understanding and accommodating.  The waitstaff is very nice and out going.  \n\nFuture:\nWith at least 5 different spots in the area that have fantastic breakfast options, this restaurant will have to do much better to survive...As this is there 2nd day opening i am going to return in a few weeks to try the food again.....with that being said i am giving this diner a generous 2 out 5 until i try the food again.",

Obviously very friendly and passionate about his business. When we got seated we had an extremely friendly server who helped us out. The menu has a lot more of the breakfast options than lunch, and a lot more savory items than sweet. I had the biscuits and gravy which were very good. The Ava potatoes are a little different from what I like. I like a crispy potato at breakfast, and these are a bit more of a breakfast mash type of thing.

  "text": "My sister in law raves about this restaurant so we trekked all the way from NJ to Philly to try this place. I was initially skeptical, I've been to many a noodle shops in my days ranging from Taipei, HK, LA, to NYC so the bar was high. Still though I was pleasantly surprised by my meal.\n\nFirst off the appetizers were different. They serve a ping pan appetizer where you can choose three appetizers. The beef tendons were rather good! I know I know, who eats beef tendons right??? But this one was different. Slice super thin, wasn't mushy, tender but still had a chewy texture to it. Their appetizer combos also come with pao chai pickled veggies that were pretty tasty.\n\nNoodle texture: glad to report that they are indeed hand drawn! You can choose between the thin noodles and knife cut chunky noodles and the texture was chewy, just what you would expect from a hand drawn noodle\n\nThere's several beef options all of which were tender and flavorful. Try the House Special Combo, comes with a meatball that has a different stuffing/tecture. \n\nThis restaurant also offers other appetizers such as fried mantou's with condensed milk, a slew of boba drinks, smoothies. Service was great and food was served fast! Restaurant was very clean and there are larger tables for groups along with smaller tables. \n\nWord of warning: we came at 130pm for lunch and it was still busy",

We were going to do a take out.  When we arrived about 30 minutes later, the order was only partially done.  We waited an additional 20 minutes and when we got out to the car, the order was wrong, and we had to go back in and wait another 10 minutes.  \n\nIt was a terrible waste of time.  The staff was a black eye on a reputable chain.",

  "text": "In the spirit of Cinco de Mayo, my fiancé and I decided to finally visit this spot. We were pleasantly surprised. We started off with chips and salsa, the salsa had a nice kick to it. We then had one of my favorite Mexican sides, corn on the cob with mayo, cheese, and seasoning. That alone was worth the visit. My fiancé ordered chicken flautas and I ordered the mole enchiladas. It was my first time trying dark mole sauce, and it wasn't my favorite mix of flavors but I appreciated the dish nonetheless. My fiancé's flautas were delicious with fresh salad and guacamole. \n\nDespite being busy, our service was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. At the end, there was a small mix up with our check, but it was handled quickly and very professionally. The staff was apologetic even though we weren't even upset. Things happen. \n\nOverall a great experience. I look forward to visiting this local spot again.",

  "text": "This is a New Mexican restaurant in St Petersburg off of 4th street, very close to downtown. I went for lunch on a Saturday. Once seated, I was immediately provided complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa tasted fresh and had very good flavor. I ordered the Mexican Mule (their version of a Moscow Mule) which was absolutely delicious . It cost $13 but it was extremely big. \n\nFor lunch I ordered the trio of tacos; chicken, asada and carnitas. All 3 needed some sort of sauce or crema. The chicken was extremely dry. The asada had very good flavor and was my favorite of the 3. The carnitas was average. I felt the tacos could have all been topped/dressed differently but instead they all were the same but for the protein. \n\nAll in all, the place is nice, clean and close to downtown st Pete. I give it a 3 not because it's \"bad\" but because I simply think it's average/good. Certainly not the best Mexican food you will have;\nNot even the best in st Pete. But it is good and will satisfying a Mexican craving if you have one.",

Let me start off by saying the experience of purchasing my dress was fine, nothing special they didn't make me feel uncomfortable but it wasn't the experience I wanted. However, the alterations department that this place is unprofessional, rude, and wants to take your money.  3 of my brides mates paid an additional 200$ for alterations on top of 220$ for the dress. They purposely order dress sizes larger to up the cost of the dress and then charge twice as much because the alterations are so dramatic. It was not only for the wedding dress but for each of the bridesmaids dresses too. Each bridesmaid was ordered a dress that was 4 sizes  or more too big. They were charged extra for more fabric and then had extra charges for alterations. The alterations ladies would alter the dress incorrectly or not enough so that additional alterations were needed. I would not  recommend they place to my enemy for weddings dress or dress shopping.",

The noise level was horrible; I had to practically shout to be heard. We ordered a club sandwich (nice portion,) smoked salmon dip (which is delicious,) a Caesar salad, and chicken and waffles. It took about 40 minutes to get our order even though the only things that actually had to be cooked were the chicken and waffles and the fries that came with the club, and still the chicken and waffles came out cold, not lukewarm, but cold and we had to ask another server for syrup.  We sent it back and told them that they could just heat it up instead of making a fresh one; the new plate came out quickly and hot but the waffle was dense and undercooked. The family used to like going here on special occasions b/c is literally within 6 blocks of home, but this is the last time we'll take our chances. It's sad because this place had so much promise when it opened but the prices aren't worth the noise, cold food, and slow service.",

Little care is taken with the garlic spinach not to overpower the dish. \n\nThe steak offerings have been the same for too long, and technique has suffered. My husband loves the Cowboy ribeye so when I stopped by for a solo cocktail, I got one \"to go\" to surprise him. There were grill marks on one side and gray nothingness on the other. This steak had not seen a broiler at all. I thought perhaps they cook it differently for take out. I inquired on my next visit and was assured it was supposed to be exactly the same. I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium steak. Premium price when I could have gotten a better sear at home in my cast iron pan? No thanks. While this is just one example, we have been unimpressed with the food and outdated menu for some time. Dry aged or grass fed beef? Nowhere to be found. I can now get prime beef at BJs. That alone isn't a selling point anymore.",

When he initially came over to introduce himself and take our drink order, he knelt right beside me and my daughter looked at me and asked/stated... \"Daddy, your face is saying that he committed a Man-Law Violation?! Yes, yes he did... much too close. But no points are deducted when a person is giving great hospitality and service.  Makes me wonder if everything really is BIGGER in Texas.\n\n\nLet's see how the main coarse goes... 45 minutes later... So I had a 16oz sirloin and it melted like butter! Great steak! The house steak sauce was another story altogether... watered down, very bland and not a good pairing for such an amazing steak. Thanks once again to Paul for rescuing a choice steak with a bottle of A1 steak sauce.\n\nOur appetizers were great as well, thanks Paul for the suggestion of a \"Triple Treat\" Potato skins, fried pickles (Amanda's favorite) and buffalo wings. My daughter loved her baked potato but was a title puzzled by the chicken tenders because they looked more like chicken nuggets.\n\nOverall, great Job Paul!

They had a lot of the Disney ducks so I was able to get 2 full sets and give some to my niece as well. \n\nI was also looking for peeps plush stuffed animals that I couldn't find anywhere and I ended up finding a bunch in the holiday section in the  back on the top of a shelf. \n\nThis target never seems to be overwhelmingly crowded either with so many people trying to grab stuff from the bullseyes section. Sometimes you can barely move there's so many people over there. \n\nWe will be back the next time I want to get some other seasonal decoration  from the bullseyes section. Haha",

  "text": "We were super excited to find an Italian Deli near Indian Rocks Beach, this review COULD have been so much higher but when we ordered our sub we asked for a roast beef, extra red roasted peppers, extra fresh mozzarella and Mayo. The young man taking our order told that because we wanted a crunchy bread that sandwich would be $14 we were like fine. We also requested that part of the sandwich have just a little mayo and ham for our child. He said he would make 3/4 with roast beef and 1/4 with ham with very little mayo, said perfect. He asked if we wanted tomatoes and lettuce we said no thank you.  He hands me the sandwich with lettuce and tomato, so we said we asked no tomatoes no lettuce- he started to reply that wasn't the case. We explained one of us is allergic to tomatoes could he please remake the sandwich. He did but this why I am giving this deli 1 star if I could I would lower it!!! He obviously just wiped the lettuce and tomatoes off the sub. When someone is allergic to something they can't ingest it. So now we are on the beach and I paid over $21.47 for a sandwich that has been fingered to get the items off it and given back to us. The ham has a ton of mayo not light mayo so now I need to find a new meal to order from since we can't take the risk of an allergic reaction. This was very disappointing! I know we are specific on what we want but there are reasons why we are so specific. This sandwich is not a difficult one to make especially for an Italian Deli! Note to management / Owner you need to train your deli staff to take allergies more seriously at this place.",

  "text": "So what happened to this Nordstrom? Customer service is terrible, the floor (at least upstairs) is way under staffed and the staff that is on the floor is not super helpful. \nFor instance I was looking for a shirt for family pictures, I wanted a navy or red wine colored shirt. When I asked the lady (from whichever section NYDJ is sold) if they had any good navy or red wine colored shirts she said \"oh I'm sure there are some around, let me know if you find something and need a room\". Hmmm that's not what I was hoping for. \nThen there was an older lady in the shoe dept that had no knowledge of shoes and a super attitude! It was bizarre. \nThe staff that used to be there, like 4 years ago was awesome! Now it's sub-par. \nI hate to be like this but are the employees at Nordstrom aware they are there to help/serve us the customers? \nSo for the time being I will be ordering my (and family's) stuff Nordstrom online and will dread the days I have to make returns. \n\nNovember 2018\nI just don't understand this place. The majority of the people that work here have the worst attitude. The only ones I have encountered that don't seem to hate their job are the ones in the men's department and a few in the shoes. \nThe ladies upstairs in tbd and bp are just down right pissed off at the world. I walked around with my hands full of stuff I wanted to try on for over 10 minutes, then I had to ask for a room and a lady said \"yeah they are right there\" pointed me in the direction-didn't grab the stuff, or help in any way. I was so annoyed at the whole situation I scanned what I wanted and ordered it online just so no one got commission from me. \nNordstrom are you listening? This store needs some leadership and culture training.",

  "text": "Schenk's Family Bakery on Veree Avenue in the Fox Chase neighborhood of Philadelphia, has been in the flour, water and yeast business since the early twentieth century when their first generation started baking in Germany before immigrating to Germantown  and opening their shop in 1938. Both the family and the bakery have moved around, but always remained Philly centric. Their recipes travelled well.\n\nToday, their storefront is small and lined with glass display cases and shelved walls, all full of their classic cookies, doughnuts, cupcakes, custom iced cakes and amazing pound cake. My small sample of half dozen doughnuts (glazed, vanilla iced, cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar) were all fresh, lightly yeasty and full of sweet flavor. They were perfect for accompaniment with hot coffee. \n\nThe vanilla pound cake was dense, moist and was solidly superior to any commercial effort I have eaten. Better even than Starbucks, which has been on my pedestal for a long while. It would have been great heated with a scoop of ice cream, but stood unapologetically on its own. Why they loaded it up on three sides with copious amounts of white icing is a mystery. It was truly an amazing sugar coating, but unnecessary given the quality of what it covered. Diabetic overkill. \n\nThat shelf of large Eagles playoff cakes looked great and gave comfort that they would be the hit of any party or cold afternoon tailgate at the Linc. Unfortunately, the sweetness would not be enough to change the outcome of the game to come.",

The food was amazing. Everything was at least a bit spicy but we loved it. The BBQ was tender, smoky, and the portions were big! I got the turnip greens which were the best I've ever had, and the Mac and cheese which was basic but delicious in my opinion. Drinks are served in huge mason jars which is great. Prices were fantastic, less than 10.00 for a platter and a soda. The food came out quickly and the service was fantastic. It is cash only. Will go back on our next trip down!",

  "text": "As a Filipino living in Nashville, you can just imagine how excited I was to hear about this place so we just had to try it!\n\nCame tonight during their happy hour from 4-6. Mannnn were they packed! Nashville is definitely excited to try this restaurant out as they should!\n\nSitting right in the heart of the gulch, right across Sambuca, the restaurant is beautiful inside. It's big and it can hold big parties. I even saw a segregated room which hopefully you can reserve for private dinner.\n\nWe sat at the bar and had their happy hour cocktails. Delicious! But I do want to talk about food so let's get to it.\n\nPORK ADOBO FRIED RICE: this is the BEST thing that I've had just yet. It is honestly perfect and just right. Bartender even told me that this is the most underrated dish they have- people never order it. But he said it's what he always get at the end of his shift. It is DELICIOUS! GET IT!!!!!!\n\nSISIG:. Traditionally made with left overs from a pig's face - this is a traditional bar food in the Philippines. Don't worry! They only serve it with pork belly! It was my favorite from everything we've ordered. \nUpdate- it was really good the first time we had it. The 2nd time, I wish it was a little crispier.\n\nLUMPIA: traditional egg rolls. You know, I'm a little biased because I've had so many lumpia growing up. I've had better but my husband thought it was good.\n\nBAO: I had their pork belly bao. Really delicious! The bun is on point and that's always the hardest to make. \n\nCHICKEN INASAL: decent. Not bad. I didn't think it was amazing but I didn't think it was bad either.\n\nSUNDA SUNDAE: dessert and it's their take on the traditional Halo-Halo dessert. You should try it! Also Halo-Halo literally translate to Mix-Mix so when you order this, take a picture, then mix it all together. You have to mix it until the Ube ice cream is completely melted. Trust me!\n\nRIDICULOUS: this was pretty good. It's basically ice cream wrapped with cake. I thought it was just ok. \n\nService Was good, too! It was their first week so one of the items that we ordered didn't arrive so our bartender gave us our dessert for free. I thought that was really nice. Shoutout to them!\n\nParking- there is another parking garage across Bar Louis and it's really cheap parking. There's also a parking garage literally right next to it in the same building so don't worry about that!\n\n\nOverall, I'm so glad we tried this place and I'm so glad they decided to open a restaurant in Nashville!",

There's an outdoor park, chairs, and even water spouts for young children to play in.  For adults, there are a few cafes and restaurants with food and beverage.  Parking was good and only cost $2hr for the first two hours.  The family and I will be back again for sure!!",

  "text": "There's something about thrifting and finding treasures that gives me goosebumps! The thrill of finding the hidden treasure is hard to explain unless you yourself are avid thrifter, a dumpster diver and a price checker! \n\nI had bookmarked my stops before traveling to Northern Liberties. And Once Worn was definitely in the to do list. As I walked up I could see a SALE rack! Those discounted racks can be the quick fix for sure. It  was my lucky day. I saw it hidden...it was a ..Catherine Malandrino dress!!! Wow! And in black! I tried to contain my glee for the true test. \n\nThen....dun dun dun...dressing room! The place that is the true decisions maker in my book.  I closed the curtain and the clerk remarked the Velcro that connects the curtain to the wall. Brilliant! I hate it when there's a little gap and people can see in. And then when I slipped the dress on..it was easily a Va-Va-Voom dress!! Fit like a glove! And I have to wear black at work some days. It was also work appropriate, flattering and feminine. There was black on black leopard pattern in the front section down. Gorgeous. \n\nI felt the need to pay and try to not tempt myself to buy the whole store. The clerk and I chatted for like 15 minutes! She was a total sweetheart! \n\nI had so much fun I told my friend who's into vintage to check it out! And from what I hear she made out like a bandit! Lulu Guinness was amongst the loot. Another one of my faves! This place is on my list for all future visits!! And I almost wanted to not review and keep it alllllll to myself but I'm too nice! Enjoy and find some treasures!",

  "text": "This is more of an \"I'm in shock\" review than anything else. We love Fork, we eat here every few months. But today after brunch, we brought home a cinnamon roll for my daughter who couldn't come along with us. I snuck a bite and THERE WAS A BUTTON in the dough! \n\nWe called the restaurant and after being put on hold for a good amount of time, the acting manager came on the line and was less than sympathetic. His response to the situation was super awkward and borderline rude. He noted that the chef was wearing the same coat as he was yesterday when making the rolls and no button was missing (ok, ew - why no clean coat?!) but that they'd \"look into it\" and someone would call me tomorrow. (I had to ask him if he needed my phone number to call me back so not sure about the sincerity of that statement. )\n\nWe were polite and definitely are not looking for a handout, freebie, etc., just thought the restaurant should know that a customer bit into a button. Why not just take responsibility and apologize? Super disappointed with the way the situation was handled, and now feeling like the kitchen is less clean/sanitary than we thought. Thumbs down, Fork. Photo of button for the manager who seemed to believe that a lost button in the cinnamon roll was impossible.",

Felt warm from the cold outside.  \nHad to pay for parking in the front of the restaurant. \nWe placed a to-go order,  and it took about 20 minutes; which wasn't bad.  \nWe then tried some drinks while waiting.\nSurbabia and Stove rose sangria. Both tasted okay.\n\nWe got deviled eggs, boom boom shrimp and tap smoked cheesesteak. \n\nDeviled eggs were okay, a little too mustardy for my taste.  Has a hint of sweetness,  like caramelized onions.\n\nboom boom shrimp were just okay.  It had a lot, and I  mean a lot more cauliflower than the shrimp.  It should be called boom boom cauliflower with shrimp.\n\ntap smoked cheesesteak was great.  It was the best item out of what I got. \n\nTry it out if you're in the area!",

She recommended an appetizer that was very thin like pita bread almost paperthin and it had a very fresh pico de Gallo on top with cilantro onions tomatoes and a sauce that we really liked. I ordered the chicken tiki masala. I'm not an expert on it but it tasted very good. My wife is vegan and they really bent over backwards to make some dishes for her. She didn't care too much for one dish but I liked it. The other Dish she did like it I wish I could remember the name but if you are vegan just let them know and they will make some suggestions or modify a dish for you. The prices were very reasonable in my opinion",

The guy I had was really nice (he was the younger one) but did a horrible job shaping my nails and with the gel polish. The gel polish is very uneven and has dark spots where there isn't enough polish. I brought it up to him and he told me it's because the color is so light, but I've had this color before. The tips of my nails barely have any polish at all. He was just really horrible at applying polish. My nails are very uneven in length and shape too.

The crew brought it into the house unboxed the couch and put it together half way. Then hands me the clipboard and says sign for furniture. So I did and crew left. My husband and I put the furniture the rest of the way together and I noticed that the middle piece of the sectional was sagging in the back. So of course this place of business was closed to call anyone so we said we would call first thing in the morning on Monday. So I called and the gentleman I spoke to told me that there was nothing they were going to do because we shouldn't have signed for the furniture and asked if we purchased the warranty which we did and told us we needed to go through them to get the sectional replaced. I told the gentleman that I was floored that I would receive damaged furniture and have to make a warranty claim already. He said that how do they know that we didn't break the furniture over night I didn't even have the energy to fight with this gentleman. So my husband called the warranty company the next day and started a claim, the lady that was helping him said she was going to get into contact with the furniture store because if they delivered it damaged they needed to bring out a new piece. So after couple days of back and forth the furniture store said we were sol and warranty would have to cover it. Husband got back in contact with the lady that was helping him and she told him that they weren't going to replace it because the gentleman that she was dealing with at the furniture store admitted to her that the furniture was indeed BROKEN when it left the warehouse July 15th in the evening!!! So now we are stuck with a broken couch and no one to help replace or fix the couch.",

Those came out to a small group sitting near me at the bar that included a man who clearly needed some food in his stomach.\n\nIn my opinion, two people can easily fill themselves on this small size pizza while enjoying a drink or two to wash it down. \n\nThere are plenty of beer options, most of which are available in coolers appropriate for a small and older grocery store. There are a handful of craft beers on draft as well and apparently they do pour some wine too...or those wine bottles are just to hold big fake roses and throw people off.\n\nUnfortunately for people like me who drink \"crap on tap,\" as Mr. Dunderbak calls it, Lee's has none of that. Not even \"crappy crap\" in cans or bottles like PBR or The Champagne of Beers. Which is fine, I get it. They kindly offer Coke products for us old souls who do like French toast, but want the actual breakfast and not a huge brown bottle at an 8.8% ABV.\n\nObviously, they keep it real simple here: Pizza, wings, craft beer. Seems like they know what they're doing and the employees openly appreciate their customers.\n\nAs I finish this review, the Yelp survey questions below include \"Good for Dancing: Yes, No, Not Sure.\" I marked \"No\" because the only folks dancing here have had way too much of that French toast beer or ABV equivalent and not enough of their quality pizza.",

This location isn't in the best spot. It's near downtown and near the expressway. We were walking back to our hotel after doing the Honky  Tonk bars, so we ignore the untidy area and went inside. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. The menu on the board still had excellent prices and the same food items.  This is definitely the place to go for a good cheap meal, and the must-have milk shakes.",

The sales associate, Leslie Black was there to assist us. She showed us different variations of the product and gave us her own input on how it should be styled. She was extremely helpful. At checkout i even asked if she make the bag \"cute\" lol. She put tissue paper and added a nice silver bow. Thanks for all your efforts. I was an extremely satisfied customer and my aunt as well! I then visted the mens department and picked up a few items on my own, the other assoicates were friendly as well. I love the atmosphere here amongst other department stores where i feel hawked at, i like to go at my own pace and not feel pressured to make a purchase. Always a great experience.

Very much enjoyed our visit here; from the magic to the ambiance, it was superb. They have an amazing collection of ancient playing cards, and Houdini's handcuffs. The upclose magic was really stunning, and two of the magicians really stood out as incredible, a mentalist and a guy with a floating cigarette, both leaving us scratching our heads and guessing days and days later! The food was okay, prices were high, but since you don't pay separately for the magic, it made sense. Would definitely be a repeat customer, but wonder if they rotate out the magicians/acts or if its the same guys indefinitely.",

The rooms were immaculately clean, but the furnishings and amenities were worn and definitely ready for the recycle bin. \n\nThe service at the hotel was wonderful!  The staff were wonderfully friendly, which definitely made up for any disappointment in the decor.  The evening reception featured an open bar and snacks, which was right up my alley as I had to go back to my room to  pack for a 6 am flight.  The hotel is close to the Saguaro National Park, which offers a stunning view of Tucson and its desert beauty.  It's also close to many restaurants and a Target in case you forgot something.  \n\nI hope to be able to return after the renovation so that I can really take in all of the improvements!!!",

This would have been 5 stars except for the noise level (so loud we could barely hear ourselves think and were shouting to converse). We didn't have drinks so I can't comment on those. Our food was really delicious though and I give all of what we ordered a thumbs up. One person in our party had the mussels and almost licked the bowl. Another person had the fish tacos (celiac so it was nice for her to have a full gf option) and I had the salmon poke (dairy sensitivity so again, nice that they were so accommodating) and it was truly amazing. It sounded good and was not disappointing. We each only had an appetizer size portion, but honestly, that was perfect. What was served at other tables looked and smelled great as well. If you can sit outside (it was raining so that wasn't an option), I would think that's a good place. Enjoy!",

It is a true shame that what was once so pure and good has now been corrupted and will forever be associated with one of the largest political scandals in our city's history. I only had the opportunity to visit the Foundation once, but I was awe-struck at the collection, the presentation, the grounds, and the genuine sense of respect you feel for the entire idea behind it. \n\nDo yourself a favor and watch \"Art of the Steal.\" Unfortunately, the chance to see the Barnes collection in its rightful home has passed.",

The only spice i could taste in both mine and my wife's dish was salt or msg.  And lots of it.  More spices are definitely needed for Mexican style food.  The fajitas were bland, and the bacon wrapped shrimp tasted like they used Hormel pre-cooked microwavable bacon. I have seriously had better bacon at McDonalds.  The rice was as unflavorful as the rest of the meal, and even the guacamole, their namesake, tasted like it came from a can.    There are way too many superior Mexican restaurants in the area at a much cheaper cost for me to consider returning.  I would even consider Chipotle a superior restaurant.  Guac is one step above Taco Bell, but charges super premium prices.",

  "text": "My first experience with Japanese food done fast food style will likely be my last.  I guess overall, I just really expected it to at least taste good - even if it wasn't AUTHENTIC Japanese cuisine.  Unfortunately, I was pretty much feeling indifferent toward the dish and a little pissed at my newly, much-lightened wallet.\n\nI ordered the Spicy Chicken platter (not spicy at all, just like the no-personality cashier said).  You do get a LOT of food.  I also threw in an order of Vegetable Spring Rolls (those actually were delicious, but they're pretty hard to screw up!)   I guess I should start out by saying I'm not a sushi lover.  I'll nibble on it every once in awhile, but I just haven't ever really gotten into it.  I can tell this place probably prides itself on its sushi, but the entire place smelled so unappetizingly fishy, I can't imagine that even the most avid sushi lover would have enjoyed it.\n\nThe Sumi & Corn/Bowtie Salads that I chose for sides literally made me say \"Meh\" outloud and the vegtable skewer mostly got in my way while I was trying to eat the chicken.\n\nAll together (with an iced tea) it came to over 14 dollars for just me to eat.  Kind of ridiculous when you're eating something that pretty much tastes like it came from a mall food court.\n\nOverall, if you're feeling some Japanese or sushi and you happen to be near a SanSai, stop in, get some spring rolls to hold you over, and then make reservations at a better place for dinner at close to the same price.",

Harrahs NOLA is non-smoking (yay!), gives free beer and cocktails while you are playing (yes!), but not the premium pours like Grey Goose, Patron, or Fiji water unless you pay the upcharge or are a diamond rewards member (drats!). You can order drinks at the machines now(yes!). Craps tables have 10x odds (yes!). They have the \"no craps\" variant at 10x odds as well. Mini Baccarat at $10 min bet during the day (yes!).  21+3 Blackjack tables with $10 min during the day. They also have the higher house odds three card, pai gow, and other poker variants.\n\nThey have a full selection of video slots and progressive, video blackjack, and video poker. Jacks or better $1 video poker are 9-5 machines, others are 8-5. Video blackjack lets you split and double down even at the $0.25 bet (yes!). They also have video roulette, video actor blackjack, and the \"bop it\" craps machine at $2 to $3 min bet during the day. They have a poker room (of course), and if they have a sports book section, I didn't see it.\n\nTo the other reviewer: sounds obvious, but don't gamble money you can't afford to loose. I played craps for two hours, got free drinks, and left with my bankroll plus a few bucks intact.",

  "text": "I enjoy going out for breakfast with my husband on Sunday's. We have eaten at the Brunchery a handful of times...the food is pretty good but sometimes too salty. Service could definitely  improve...took my mother-en-law there for brunch. Our server forgot to put in her meal order...not sure how that happens ...by the time her food arrived at the table our food was cold...yes, we  could have eaten our food when it was hot...right out of the kitchen...but that would have been rude to eat in front of her...it took 20 minutes longer for my mother-en-laws food to finally get to the table. Over all the place is usually good...they are really busy as it is a popular place for the locals. It's not my favorite place to eat breakfast as it is \"hit & miss\"  as far as the food is concerned...I would say  maybe 3 stars.\n Suggestions:  1. -  tell the cooks to go easy on the salt.  The last seafood scramble I ordered  was so salty I had to send it back. They brought me something else and all ended well. 2. - Offer more selections for folks that don't eat meat..not everybody loves bacon.",

  "text": "I must say that having traveled in China, Hong Kong, and major cities in the world including NYC, where there are alot of Chinese people and Chinese restaurants, Fushia Asian Bistro does a very nice job.  The service is always very nice and helpful and the food is the real Szechuan spice!  I come here for my Szechuan fix that I need every other week.  Although the dishes can be extremely spicy hot, that is what Szechuan food is supposed to be.  One can order other less spicy dishes as well.   \n\nMy main criticism is that the menu is too long with too many items that it is a bit confusing and hard to nuddle through.  Also, they need menus to go.  Otherwise, I really like this place and when you walk in and see all the foreign born Chinese people there with their families and friends, you know that it is the real deal.  \n\nI love the fact that they have brown rice and beer, wine, and sake!  I wish more people knew about this place because it is tucked away on Amberly in New Tampa and a treat to have!",

  "text": "I just moved from San Jose to Marana literally the night before I called this Ulta salon.  The day before I had went to \"my\" Ulta in San Jose and was able to use my points from my reward card for a free haircut and conditioning treatment with a stylist I'd used previously (and had no problems with).  Unfortunately, when the haircut was done, I was in such a hurry to get home and finish packing, I threw my hair up into a ponytail and didn't even check to see if it was ok.  After I got to Marana the next day, showered, and fixed my hair, I couldn't help but be annoyed with some of the uneven layers around my face.  Nothing major by any means, but enough that it would bother me until I got it fixed.  \n\nI called this Ulta, explained that it had been a rewards points' cut in California and asked what their policy was on fixing it, the charge, etc.  After checking with the manager, the gal on the phone apologized they couldn't get me in sooner (so I'm thinking 2-3 days), but she means they couldn't get me in that afternoon!  I was scheduled for noon the next day.  \n\nThe manager shampooed, cut, and blow dried my hair for no charge.  She did an excellent job, and it's sad that (I think she said) her last day would be that following Friday.  This salon, compared to other Ulta salons I've seen, was very neat and organized.  I hope it stays that way with the new manager as well.  \n\nAppreciated the help these gals gave me, hoping I'm able to send some more folks their way.",

I could have traveled with my own bike, but decided not to thinking they would be available as advertised. Our WiFi was terrible and cell service was non existent in the room.

Their prices may be the best in town. They come to know you and your pool/spa. Their customer service stands on it's own without comparison, but I'll briefly tell how I came to be a customer.\n       I had used another pool company. Maybe the first pool company  that might come to mind. They've been around a long time. We used them to build a $36,000 spool (2500 gal in ground heated spa) They also sell PATIO furniture and build POOLS. And offer service and supplies.\n We had a rental with pool which tenants let go green without telling us quickly during Monsoon. We spent a lot in chemicals and tested frequently when told to. Finally got it under control. The last time I was in one of their stores was when I took a water sample in and the lady said    \n\"you know we usually like to do these tests about once a month. The testing piece we use cost a bit of money\"\n  So everyone who has never been to an E-Konomy Pool store should go there next time they need any pool/spa supplies or service.

  "text": "I've been a fan of Dmitri's for years (especially this Queen Village location--I don't love the one in Fitler Square), but my latest experience was less than positive.  My girlfriend and I had dinner on a recent Sunday evening, and the results were uneven and mostly negative.\n\nWe were seated quickly in a mostly full restaurant, and the greeter warmly filled our water glasses and prepared our wine.\n\nWe started by sharing the beet salad and a bowl of mussels in a white wine sauce.  The beet salad came first, and it was simple but very good.  While the salad set a positive tone, it wasn't indicative of what would follow.  The mussels that soon followed were in a broth that was bland, despite its numerous vegetables.  I think it just needed more wine.  The mussels themselves were cooked fine, but they were below average, I'd say.\n\nFor our main courses, I ordered scallops and my girlfriend seafood fettuccini.  My scallops were served nearly 5 minutes before the fettuccini--not ideal but also not a big deal.  More of a problem was that the fettuccini, which was supposed to be in a red sauce, was served in exactly the same broth as the mussels.\n\nI was in the bathroom when her food was served, so she wanted to wait for me to make sure she was correct about the sauce.  She was.\n\nMy girlfriend advised the waitress, who responded, \"Yeah, you're right.\"  She asked if she wanted something else, and since nearly everthing else we ate wasn't great (and she consequently ate a lot of bread), she said, \"No, thanks.\"  The waitress then said, \"Ok.\" and left, but not until after she asked if I wanted the food boxed up, not yet ten minutes after it was served.  I asked if she meant my food, and she said, \"No--hers,\" so I said, \"Well, you'll have to ask her.\"  Weird, and never once did she apologize for the mix-up.\n\nI ate half of my scallop platter (which came with pretty good sauteed collared greens and an unseasoned pile of rice), which was ok but not remarkable, and then we had the balance of the entrees boxed up.\n\nTo the waitress' credit, we realized she took the fettuccini off the bill without us asking.  \n\nOverall, the staff was attentive and friendly enough, but it wasn't enough to make up for food that was so-so at best.  I understand that Dmitri's goes for simply prepared food, but if that's the case, it should be prepared nearly flawlessly, and 3 of 4 of the dishes we ordered, we had no desire to finish.\n\nI've come to expect a lot more out of Dmitri's, so I hope this visit was just an anomaly.  I'll head back at some point to give them another shot, but I also won't be so quick to recommend them anytime soon.",

Eyemart Express is a bit better and you don't have to wait 2 weeks for glasses for the most part. Usually you can get them the same day",

In the process, we rediscovered the really impressive beer that this place quietly brews...for years, but still with innovation.  The coffee Porter was among the best I've had.  My husband loves the Motivation Destroyer IPA, so appropriate for the times we are in and so, so good.  And the cheeseburgers with brioche bun and fries....heaven.  So pick up the phone, order a meal and beers to go.  You won't be disappointed...and you'll be helping keep a local Santa Barbara gem in business.",

I requested Kevin and Tina (per usual) and guy on the phone said \"I will see what I can do.\" with attitude. I've never in the two years of coming here have been told that. Which I get they're busy a lot of the time, but I didn't appreciate that. My mom was given a new guy who did my mom's pedi in literally 10 minutes! Ridiculous! It looked awful, didn't clean her cuticles, took 30 seconds to rub her feet and the nail polish looked like my 2 years godson painted them. I had asked Kevin if he could fix her pedi and do her mani and he did. Bless his soul! While Kevin was fixing her pedi, the guy (that did the original pedi)  LAUGHED! Thought it was hilarious. Which I was not okay with. But let it go. My mom had told the receptionist what was going on and she was so kind, listened to my mom on what she was upset about, and had said to call her over next time so she can address it. My mom and I are NEVER to complain but these new people need to be trained. Hopefully when I take my mom again, Tina will be there.",

I pretty much wait till the very last moment, when I wake up and think \"Okay-- now I actually can't go out in public anymore until this is resolved\".\nIt was on one of the rainiest, soggiest days that I drifted into Verve.  It's a chic little spot that sells uber high-end products.\nA.J. cut my hair and did a good job.  She gave me a nice overall trim with some layers in the front.  Perked up my color-- \nI didn't ask for anything radical so-- not sure what I can grade this place on.\nMake sure you look at the prices if you decide to buy some of their products.  I fell in love with the smell of their \"organic\" line of shampoos and conditioners.  I even had both bottles with me at the check out counter--\nThat is, until I realized they were $26 dollars a bottle!  Yeow...  that's above my budget for hair products, even if I do like the scent.\nHappy haircuts!",

  "text": "Our visit: This was our first visit. We visited on a Saturday at 7:30pm. \n\nThe reservation: The hostesses had a few mess ups with us. There were two working the hostess stand. The older woman (post 50) who is vivacious and energetic answered the phone the first time we called and pretended the restaurant was very unavailable. I called at 6pm asked for the first available table for the night for 2. She said they were avail at 8:15pm. I asked if there was anything earlier and she said maybe 8pm and eventually quoted 7:30pm as if she was doing us a big favor for a party of 2. After grappling with the consideration of waiting an hour for the table, I called again. This time the younger hostess answered the phone. She said there was no wait. LOL. So we arrived and there was no wait. ..........\n\nThe strawberry feta salad: amazing!!!! I devoured that salad. \n\nChicken parm: I didn't eat the chicken because the pasta was so good, but the pasta was amazing. \n\nThe lava cake: this is not a lava cake. It is a brownie that has not been cooked all the way through. I didn't eat much of it. \n\nThe service: now, despite all the flubs, this is why I can not in good conscience give less than four stars. Our server, Maria, was wonderful!! She was calm, collected, knowledge, and delightful. We later learned she's worked there for eight plus years. We briefly interacted with a young food runner with a bad attitude. She was 25-35 in age, thinning blonde hair in a ponytail, slender, corse in demeanor and a tad condescending. I held my tongue and was exceedingly polite to her to counter her condemnation and my usually obtuse husband actually noticed her rudeness and commented after she left the table. I later needed my waitress mostly because the foodrunner kind of left without saying anything-- haha I assume she's a food running because why else would she behave that way. I noticed another server, Kevin, walk by and asked him if he could get our waitress. He responded by saying that he could help us. And we learned from him that our server, Maria, is his wife and they met at this restaurant and have been working there for eight years. They were both so calm and courteous. Next time I return, I'll be sure to request that one of them take care of us on the off chance that the food runner is actually a server and she is our waitress next time. \n\nThe ambiance: sit down. There is a coat rack near the booths and it's a full service restaurant with evening lighting.",

  "text": "If your wallet can handle a $13 salad, the El Vez is the place for you--and I HANDS DOWN recommend the Mexican Chop Salad with Grilled Chicken and the Chipotle Ranch Dressing.  Don't forget to squeeze the lime on there! Delicious!  In this rare instance, the portion can easily allow for leftovers.  On more than one occasion I have been known to order this salad for lunch with coworkers as well as make the trip from south philly specifically craving this salad.  \n\nThe rest of the menu however can be a roller coaster.  The portions here are very inconsistent for the prices.  For instance, the \"tacos\" are three miniature tortillas with (although tasty) 1-2 slivers of steak, a sprig of cilantro, and a dollop of guacamole on them.  Now, while they're tasty, you will definitely be leaving there hungry if you order them.  And at $18, this appetizer (to put it nicely) is deceiving on the menu as it does not mention they are three 3\" diameter tortillas.  There are plenty of authentic tacorias in Philadelphia where $7 will get you five times the amount of food and with an undeniably authentic taste.  But they don't have a spinning motorcycle in the middle of their bar. Just sayin'. \n\nOverall I would say that El Vez is a typical Steven Starr Restaurant: well designed, contemporary interior with a hip vibe making it almost worth the above average prices. The staff, although the hippest and trendiest around, leave some personality to be desired although they reassure me it's ok to dine in my jeans and a t-shirt since that's their uniform. I would say that the food tastes good--even very good at times--but the portion sizes are so inconsistent it is like a guessing game. The nachos are a meal in itself--while the tacos are barely enough as an appetizer. Both taste great, though, as does the guacamole which is good even when avocados aren't in season...how do they do that? The margaritas are delicious but over priced--the Cantina's are just as good (if not better) and at 1/3 the cost and the option for pitchers, it might keep from making the trip north. The photobooth is a fun touch, and the outdoor seating is convenient for the area. I would give this restaurant one solid thumbs up.  If not mostly for that chop salad. :)",

I can't speak for the Hibachi portion, but our experience today on the Sushi Bar side was pleasant! Our waiter was friendly and the food tasted fresh. I ordered the onion soup and Philadelphia roll. My Hubby ordered the regular sushi combo (8 pieces and one roll, plus soup and salad.) Our meal was delivered after waiting approx 15 minutes and neither of us had anything negative to say. All in all, it was a nice lunch and for that occasion it was great and served it's purpose. We both left satisfied and will return.",

We ordered their ultimate pork sandwich, ultimate Italian hoagie and bacon cheese fries. \nNow, maybe most of these reviewers don't really know what a good sandwich is. I'm originally from Philly. I grew up with Pat's, Gino's, Steve's, Tony Luke's and Greenmans in my backyard.....\nI know what a good cheesesteak, hoagie or pork sandwich is. \nMaybe this place had a bad day, but I don't see myself coming back here any time soon. \nThe pork roll sandwich with spinach was very bland, there was a spice on it but otherwise the pork itself held no flavor. The only thing that was tasty about this sandwich was the roll. \nThe ultimate Italian hoagie was actually pretty good, it had good quality and tasty meats and cheese but it was sliced way too thick that one couldn't even fold it into a hoagie. It basically was an open roll. All the tomatoes and onions rolled off the top. The roasted peppers embedded in the sandwich were very good. \nThe bacon cheese fries, I wouldn't give to my pups. The cheese was very lumpy and thick, the bacon was very greasy and flabby and the French fries themselves were very soggy.  I can't believe people actually order these. \n\nLike I mentioned before, maybe this was a bad day for Pudges, but after reading all the raves from here, I definitely expected something edible and good.",

  "text": "I've been to Urban Farmer twice and my only gripe is the service (hence the four out of five stars). My first visit was spent at the bar area where I waited 15 minutes to order a drink! Then another 15 minutes to get a menu. Mind you it was a Tuesday night and they were not busy at all! Maybe I should sit in the middle of the bar as opposed to the side but regardless, patrons should never have to wait that long to be served... Or acknowledged. For my second visit, I decided to take my sister and her husband to dine in. We were seated right away. Awesome. We were offered bread! Hell yes we want bread! You would think the bread would come right away but it didn't. It actually came out with our appetizers.... No big deal though. Our main courses also came shortly after. I can continue to complain about the service but it really wasn't completely terrible. \n\nOverall, I think the place is amazing! I am also obsessed with the interior design... I seriously could live there! \n\nSo let's talk food. Everything I had was amazing! I ordered the duck and my sister and her hubby ordered the steak sampler to share. We also ordered brussels, mushrooms, butternut squash,  foie gras and bone marrow to share. Out of all the appetizers, I enjoyed the foie gras and marrow the most... but everything was just delicious! If you're a big meat eater, I suggest ordering the steak sampler! Worth the money! For my next visit, I'm going to go for the cheese cart and some dessert!\n\nThis is not only a great place for locals to dine, but a place tourists or guests at the Logan Hotel can appreciate. \n\nCan't wait to go back!",

  "text": "Three Sixty is a great place for drinks and appetizers with spectacular views and good ambiance. I've been there about a dozen times. I've used valet every time. The reason for my negative review, however, is that on my last visit, the valet driver damaged by vehicle and did not say anything to me. It wasn't as if they didn't know they did it - they hit the frame directly and hard. And my vehicle which is only a few months old stays parked in my garage all day every day. I wash it twice a week. I know exactly when the damage happened. I called the hotel and asked for the valet manager. Someone took a written message yet no response was received from the valet manager. I called again, asking for the valet manager, and had to leave a voice mail. Again, no response was received. That's poor business etiquette and shows apathy towards a good customer. The reputation of Three Sixty is highly tarnished in my mind. The date of the incident was April 3, 2013.\n\n\nUpdate, July 2013:\n\nAfter posting this, the valet manager did call me and they rectified the situation completely. Today will be the first time I've visited Three Sixty since the incident.",

  "text": "Initially when we moved it in seemed great, till move in day. Cheap paint, cheap everything. Floor is peeling up by their fake wood, which they will most likely try to charge us for even though it was like that the day we moved in. But that little compared to other issues.\n\nSince day one my wife and I experienced humidity levels in the 75-80% range. I told management a total of 3 times, which they never did anything about, because why would they do their job? The result of the humidity was MOLD starting to grow on decorations we have, which we ended up throwing out. The response I got from the complex was \"buy a dehumidifier\" or \"change the ac unit\". The ac units in the building are oversized ptac units which result in little to no dehumidification because they only sense dry bulb temps. Mix that with the cheap windows (I feel the draft coming in, plus a consistency of spiders I find in my apartment). Management said they would \"check on the humidity issue\" which they never have. And to management, the issue is fine now BECAUSE it's winter and there's a lack of humidity in the air. So that you for your \"concern\". But this will become an issue again in the summer. If you like to sleep comfortable do not live here. I can only imagine mold growing inside the walls this summer and us getting charged for it. \n\nNext issue,\n\nMy wife had been contacting the lady in the management office (I call her out because I don't know her name and she is the only one my wife has contacted) for our utility bill because we like to pay our bills on time. 2 months later it took a negative yelp review from her (which she took down because she is nice and the other lady who comments on these yelp reviews asked her to in exchange to waive the previous months utility bills we were waiting on). They finally sent us a bill, which was not waived, and as my wife fulfilled her end the manager who said she would waive it did not. We have all this communication in writing, and I might take this to court just for principle, because my wife also emailed her 4 times for verification the utility has been waived, but my wife has been ignored ever since she removed her yelp review (which is why I am doing one now). \n\nI have also been waiting for a parking pass for almost 2 months. The only reason that vehicle hasn't been towed is because security now knows my work vehicle. \n\nIf possible this would be zero star rating for this \"complex\". But because I can't, I guess the positive star goes to the front desk staff and security because they're always friendly and ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB. Maintenance as well, they always do their job well. \n\nThis is not all the issues I have just some of them. I would not recommend to move into this place. We are almost sure we will not be renewing our lease due to the multiple failures of management, and \"upper management\". \n\nTo the lady who comments on the yelp reviews and lied to my wife, you can be sure this review will not be edited or removed. Y'all have lied to us entirely too much for you to be trusted. And I have all your communication with my wife in writing too, which I may use as evidence. But for the time being, we are just going to pay our bills on time. And management stop giving my wife dirty looks or ignoring her because she called you out. \n\nDo not be fooled by the mimosas and smiles when you come in and look. The leasing office didn't even know the place takes money orders for rent payment (because paying online they just steal more money from you).",

We found the part listed for cheaper elsewhere and asked if they could just do the labor if we brought in our own part, they said YES but that labor would be $160.\nAs soon as we actually purchase the part and headed into Firestone for the labor, they changed their mind and said they could not do the labor unless the part was purchased there.

The service is very good, the menu diverse and their beer selection includes local brews.  I would have given 5 stars were it not for the high prices.  We paid $17.00 for a flatbread pizza which did taste very good.  The wings are $14 for 8 split wings, once again done very well and tasty but a bit pricey.  My hope is that these prices are in effect to allow them to stay in business during the pandemic and employ people in a newer establishment but these prices may stop repeat customers.

She never came back with suggestions on what we could order for drinks. Then she disappeared for at least 15 min. No one came over during that time. We were just about to leave when finally the bartender came out to ask us what we wanted. Really?! We already told the girl and you were the one giving her lip. It was so cold outside and we really wanted to warm up so we just ordered two coffees and a shot of Kailua, $17!? Another 10 min later our drinks came. We wanted to eat but after how long the drinks took we decided coffee was it. Unbelievable poor service. We're on our way to K-Paul's for lunch instead. Management should be ashamed of that kind of service.",

  "text": "If you're looking for good Mexican food, Sweet Taco is NOT the place.  I tried the pork taco and a brisket taco, both were flavorless and bland.  My dining partner tried the nachos, and they were a sorry affair with hardly any toppings and big chunks of lettuce, again, very bland.  The salsa (and I'm being generous calling it salsa) was incredibly bad, flavorless, and an odd color - almost tan.  Worst salsa ever.  Salsa is not difficult to make, so I can't image why they can't even pull a decent salsa together.  The chips served with the awful salsa were thin and crisp, and unfortunately, the best item they offered.  The guacamole had huge chunks of avacado in it and was passable, at best.  Our meals were so bad that we didn't even want to try the donuts, fearing it would be more of the same.  If you didn't like Taqueria Del Sol, you won't like Sweet Taco - all they did was change the name and add a few menu items.  Also, there are several bottles of hot sauce on each table.  I did not use any because the tops of the bottles were so crusted and sticky that it was unappetizing.  I guess they do not notice or do not care enough to clean the bottle tops occasionally.  I ate here once when it was Taqueria Del Sol, and I swore I'd never go back, well, they changed their name and fooled me a second time, but never again!",

I never noticed its existence seeing that I study at coffee groundz every once in a while.  Boy am I glad i found this place!  \n\nThe lasagna is an absolute must!  It is a homemade recipe by the owner's grandmother since the early 1900's and it is amazing!  It takes them a while to make it, I would say about 10 minutes because they are literally making it on the spot from scratch.  Most people place their orders ahead of time and take it to go because there are only 2 tables in there.  I think the whole concept of this place was fast italian food on the go.  The lasagna comes with 2 big pieces of garlic bread.  The lasagna is literally big enough to feed 2 people.  It is very filling and my new favorite lasagna in this city!  I usually do not like ordering lasagna at italian restaurants because I seem to never find one that truly satisfies me.\n\nThe second visit I made here, I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza with a small salad.  The pizza was pretty delicious as well.\n\nThe owners are extremely friendly.  I think it might be a young female and her brother?  The father is also there and extremely nice and had great stories to tell from his days working in Hollywood.\n\nOverall, great food, great service.\n\nAlso, mondays are $1.00 lone star beer nights when you purchase food!",

The section was $350 and we rented two. Fine. It came with 2 bottles of Ciroc- blah blah. Well when we arrived, we also had food trays for our guests to be placed on the tables in the section we paid $700 for. When we arrived, the we asked the Manager Rife Whiting if we could bring the trays. He replied \"no problem. Place them on your tables in your section.\" Somewhere between transferring the trays in and walking past him again, he said \"well there's really no food policy. We've never allowed food. It's $20 per tray\". Mind you, we had 5 trays in our section. I turned and said, \"$700 for the section and another $100 for the trays? If there isn't a food policy, where did this fee come from?\" I kid you not-- he told me, \"well I'm the manager and I can make up whatever I want to when I want to and if you dont want to pay this fee you can either take your food back to your car or I will take it for you.\" --- at that point. The situation escalated and my friends had to calm me down. That's bogus. It's not even about the made up fee but the tone and abuse of position. That was the last time Eiffel will ever be recommended by me.",

But after I paid the bill with cash, our waitress ignored us to the point of turning her head when she walked by. I have a very low guilt threshold so immediately thought the tip was too small. In the car, I recalculated. I hadn't misread the total. But just now, we realized that I might have miscounted the bills and left only a two dollar tip. We were traveling so I can't just run in with the difference anytime soon. I just want her to know that it was a mistake. I appreciate that she works hard and I'm very sorry.",

Since I can't, I rounded up to 4.00/5.00 for the delicious wine and great atmosphere.\n\nOn my visit to Nashville, a friend who has lived in Nashville for 3 years suggested going to Rumours. It is labeled a Wine Bar for a reason - the waitress recommended a medium body French Pinot Noir that was easy to drink and did not break the bank. The wine went down like water, resulting in splitting two bottles between two people.\n\nWe paired the wine with the cheese plate, the meatballs, & the mussel bowl with spaghetti. The cheese plate came with four wedges of cheese, including a delicious goat cheese, tomato marmalade, nuts, and an array of bread and crackers. I enjoyed all of the cheeses, except the Dijon, and would recommend asking to substitute this cheese for an additional goat cheese or the server's suggestion.\n\nThe mussel bowl came fresh to order in a white wine & capers sauce topped with feta cheese. I will most definitely order this plate on my next visit to Rumours and highly recommend it to any guest.\n\nLastly, the meatballs were tasty but tiny. I expected the serving size of 4 meatballs as it was on under the small plates section on the menu. I was surprised that the 4 meatballs were roughly 1 inch in diameter. Still, the carrot-apple-fennel slaw complement the dish perfectly. At $8 a plate, I would suggest a try if you like meatballs but recommend ordering at least 2 for tables of more than 2 people.\n\nTwo bottles and a few small plates later, we stumbled out vowing to revisit the next time that I visit. I hope to go back when the weather is a nicer to sit in the gorgeous outside area.",

  "text": "I just leased a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. The salesman was great.  Service, not so!  On a side note, I love how the manufacturer sends out a survey within days of buying a vehicle wanting to know how much you love the vehicle.  Not just jeep but they all do it.  I always respond with...give me 6 months to a year so I can drive it in different conditions.  Then I'll let you know.  I never respond with \"I love it\" in the first few days.  On my drive home from the dealership I noticed an excessive amount of wind noise coming from the passenger side roof area.  I know this vehicle isn't aerodynamic so don't go there. I understand! But the noise on the passenger side was far more noisy than the driver side.  So, I decided I was going to take it back to have it checked.  In the meantime, the blinker that is supposed to blink three times automatically when you move the lever up or down (not locked) worked intermittently.  Most of the time it did blink three times but occasionally it would only blink once.  So, I added this to the list.  They kept it for two days.  Famous quote...\"nothing is wrong\".  So I asked, what did you do for two days.  The answer;  We drove it and the wind noise is normal and the blinker never malfunctioned. So I asked, do you believe me that the blinker occasionally malfunctions or do you think I'm making this up?  They said they believe me.  I asked: So if it did malfunction when you were driving it what action would you take?  It was like a dear looking at me in the headlights.  A blank stare.  He finally said he'd have to call technical service.  I asked why he didn't do that in the first place?  He said he had to diagnose it.  I asked, rather sarcastically, did you have some diagnostic equipment connected while driving it so that if it did happen you could troubleshoot it?  He said no, they just need to see it.  Unbelievable!  He said, as long as it doesn't happen for him, there is nothing wrong.  So, reluctantly on my part, we moved on to the wind noise.  Again, he said there was nothing wrong but...they put down a bead of silicone.  I asked why?  If there is nothing wrong, why put down a bead of silicone?  Because we felt it might help.  If there is nothing wrong and its, as you say, normal, why put down a bead of silicone?  Is there a problem or not?  No problem, we just decided to put down a bead of silicone.  A couple of weeks later (4th of July) I ran my jeep through a car wash in West Chester.  Within an hour, and on a 90+ degree day the A/C unit malfunctioned. Air flow went to a minimum.  I changed fan speed and while I could hear the fan increase in speed there was no change in output.  Minimal air flow and the vehicle started getting hot.  After about an hour and a half of this it finally began running properly again.  I called the dealership and told them what happened.  The answer, unless it does it for us we can't do anything about it.  Are you serious?  Are there louvers in the duct work?  Could one of them have gotten stuck?  Is there an area where water from a car wash could have affected or gotten into something to cause this?  Again, where is the diagnostics in all of this?  Simple answer is always, unless it happens for us we can't do anything about it.  Most frustrating group I've ever dealt with.  I HATE THIS JEEP and the fact there is not one competent person to work on it or someone who will take the initiative to diagnose the issues.  Worst purchase I ever made and what makes it so difficult is now that the sale is done, no one cares!  No one!  Oh, but the survey's keep coming.  Such a joke, an absolute joke.  Oh, to top it off, I was told to take it to David's Jeep in Glen Mills.  Perhaps they can find the problem.  Now that's a comforting thought. Just pass the problem on to someone else and in the meantime I'm having to run all over the place.  Never again.",

We ordered a beef stirfry and two curry chicken dishes (Don't remember the names). The friendly server asked for our spiciness preference.

Everything was neatly packed and the food was still warm by the time we drove back home to eat. There's no indoor seating, it's a takeaway set up, but we saw a few other patrons eating in their parked cars. Service was very friendly and the guy who helped us wore a mask. \n\nOn our first trip, we ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken. Both were excellent! Hubby described the jerk chicken as \"fall off the bone.\" Our sides were fried plantains, 4 cheese baked mac, veggie fried rice and rice & peas. All were tasty, but the plantains were the standout for me. We also tried one each of the pastries: pine tart (pineapple filling), ground beef patty and 4 cheese roll. Again, all were delicious! They threw in a caribbean lemonade and sorrel (hibiscus tea) that were the perfect things to top off our meals! \n\nIn addition to their standard menu, The Pepper Pott offers rotating specials, which are announced on their Instagram along with pictures to make your mouth water. Some of the specials have been jerk salmon, bake & salt fish and curry goat. \n\nDefinitely give this family-run small business a try!!",

  "text": "Do you ever feel like sometimes you were born inside The Matrix? While everyone one else's brain is receiving signals that say the food is juicy and delicious, all you taste is 'a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals... everything the body needs' but taste buds don't desire.\n\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nI read the reviews and came here with the highest of expectations. Immediately this place began to sweet talk me. I saw the meat smoker, which was a huge turn on! The sides were open exposing delicious pink meats being slow cooked right in front of my eyes like a sexy dance! I also saw the real wood stacked out back below a large tree with branches full of REAL LIVE chickens... yes I said chickens! (BTW the way, did anyone else know chickens climb trees or am I still inside the Matrix?) As a final act of foreplay, the interior decor was just right, like candles burning around a hot bubble bath. It had that seductive gritty down home feeling I like when enjoying BBQ. The only thing missing from this BBQ romance was blues music playing live!\n\nThe chef allowed me to sample several items since I just couldn't decide what I wanted my sides to be. They'd run out of mac n' cheese, which would have been my first preference, however, the collard greens and chicken n' rice were amazing! This took my BBQ expectations even higher as I anticipated a foodgasm once I got my hands on the pork ribs I ordered. Unfortunately, this romance was not meant to be.\n\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nThe ribs were smoked to the point of tasting like cigarette ashes. I've learned since being  an active yelper than many people crave this type of smoky flavor, but it was just too much for my extremely picky BBQ palette. I would much rather have well seasoned meat with just a kiss of smoke than eat meat that should probably have a surgeon general warning label!\n\nI also don't care for BBQ sauce. If the meat is well seasoned, to me sauce is unnecessary. Yet I found myself drowning these ribs in sauce to hopefully compensate for the ashy flavor. I emptied an entire table bottle on my order, and still with little desire to eat them, I threw away my leftovers later that evening. Other items to my disliking include the potato salad and baked beans. Growing up my mother used brown sugar to sweeten her beans and that is the flavor I'm used to, but these beans tasted of syrup or molasses, which I did not enjoy. They were also practically as thick as peanut butter.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI'm not sure why people find this place to be worthy of 5 stars, but I most definitely do not. This brief encounter felt very much like being in a relationship where everyone tells you how great the person is before you meet them. When you finally do meet them, they are presentable, attractive and say all the right things. However, in the end, they just don't perform!\n\nI'm breaking up with you Al's Finger Licking Good Bar-B-Que I didn't lick my fingers, not even once.\n\n\nSIDE NOTE - This review should really be a 2.5, but I really liked the staff. They were accommodating, hospitable and kind. Not to mention the chicken n' yellow rice was simply amazing! So I have chosen to round up instead of down.\n\n\n2016/4",

When any restaurant serves you twice a normal portion, you should run from your table. \n\nI went here once, and while I say that I would visit any of my \"Avoid At All Costs\" as a follow up, I just can't stand to go here.\n\nOkay, this is an older historic property. Well, so is the food and the staff. \n\nThe menu has not changed in years and years and years. I would like to believe that they order fresh ingredients, it just tastes like cardboard. There is nothing, NOTHING redeeming about Seven Stars. \n\nIf you just walk in the front door, gaze at the floor, or go to the bathroom, you'll probably walk out. So disgusting. If you can't keep the publicly visible places clean, what do you think the kitchen looks like?\n\nAs for service, I aged several years waiting for my server. The servers definitely try to live off a dated reputation. So Washington ate here, or someone of importance in the past, you're \"privileged to even be here Mr. and Mrs. Peon. Now just eat this mush and ignore the grime.\" Ugh, f'ing a**holes.\n\nOn top of that, this place is expensive for the food quality, service and setting and it goes on and on and on. So bad.\n\nI think Seven Stars caters to an old crowd. While I respect my elders, they tend to live on tradition and nostalgia instead of taste, cleanliness and service. If you're under 70, avoid this crap-hole.\n\nNothing, nothing would ever get me back here.\n\nIF YOU FOUND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, PLEASE RATE IT AND SEND ME A COMPLIMENT.

I was amazed so as soon as I got back to Indy I decided to look for a barber. It took me 3 barber shops later (not great experiences) and I ended up at Commisary recommended by at least 6 people and telling me : get Phil Get Phil !!! \nSo I was like fine I'll get Phil. First of all Phil is booked like 2 months , and I was thinking that could be very good or very bad. I finally got an appointment. That was about six months ago. Since that first haircut Phil has been my barber every other week. I mean .. not even kidding. And sometimes I even go once a week. The feeling of professionalism is outstanding. You can see the people coming out of the barber shop looking Sharp!!!\nEveryone is extremely cool , they are all super good and you feel always very welcomed. My hair is always on point , my beard is perfect!! \nAnd is a plus you can have a Espresso or a beer there . \nCons:\nThey don't do color , I tried everything to convince them . So I still go to the salon to get my color and then I get my haircut there. Doesn't bother me. Still worth it.",

  "text": "This place advertises thirty-minute oil changes. So I made an appointment for 9am. Three hours and fifteen minutes later they were finally done. Need I say more? Okay, I'll break it down for you. I arrived at my 9am appointment about five minutes early. The person at the service desk said, \"It'll be just a couple of minutes. I've got a mechanic who is finishing up and you'll be next.\" So far, so good. Unfortunately, that's where the 'so good' ends. One hour and fifteen minutes later, finally, a mechanic comes to the parking lot to get my vehicle. He backs out of the parking space, and starts forward. A person from the service desk comes outside and stops the mechanic. After a brief conversation, the mechanic pulls my vehicle back into a parking space, gets out, goes inside and gets the keys and paperwork to another  vehicle, and pulls it in and works on it. To make matters worse, when the mechanic pulled my vehicle back into a parking spot...it was a handicap parking spot. There is nothing about me, or my vehicle that's handicapped. it disgust me when I see people parking in handicap space when they are not handicap. Yet, my vehicle sits in a handicap space thanks to the mechanic, who was pulled out of my vehicle to work on another. What happened to, \"You're next\", and \"It'll be just a couple of minutes\"? At this point, I'm about to 'blow a gasket', as the saying goes. Rather than create a disturbance inside their business, I decided to take out my frustrations here at the keyboard. So here I am. Besides, I wanted to see how this played out. At no point did anyone from the service desk call me to the counter, or come to me in the waiting area and apologize for the long delay. After more than two and a half hours, they finally pulled my vehicle in. At the three hour and fifteen minute mark, they were finished...and so am I. I will never return to this place, for any reason, as long as I live. Their website, and signs on the door advertise thirty-minute oil changes. Not true. Lastly, I will say that if you need an oil change, do not ever, never ever, go to Pep Boys. I would go to Jiffy Lube, or Valvoline. Hell, I can get a faster oil change at the dealership. It's interesting to note that there were customers who came in after me, got their vehicles worked on, and were able to drive away before me. And I had an appointment!",

  "text": "When I tell people in Philadelphia that I'm Greek-American, invariably one of the first questions I'll get is \"What's your favorite Greek restaurant in Philly?\" which is quickly followed by \"What do you think of South Street Souvlaki?\" I have always been at a loss to answer either because I don't eat out often, and when I do it's almost never at a Greek restaurant. Also, as a vegetarian, I just wouldn't go to a restaurant whose name celebrates meat. \n\nSo when my friend Brad mentioned that he'd heard about a new Greek restaurant and would I check it out with him, I was immediately interested. From the initial reviews it sounded legit, more like the food I'd grown up eating at home rather than Greek food catering to American tastes (the many complaints about the lack of lettuce in the Greek salad were a good sign). The menu does still lean more towards the preferences of meat-eaters (gotta give the market what it wants) but there are several vegetarian options. No fish entrees, which seemed like a pretty major omission for a Greek restaurant, but the garidomakaronada sounds like the shrimp Santorini I used to love, which isn't something you find often. \n\nBut anyway, for my first visit the seafood test was the xtopodi (grilled octopus). Because if a Greek restaurant can't do THAT well, it'll never be great. The verdict? It has potential, but I have to admit it's not the way I'm used to having Greek-style octopus. Usually it's cut into pieces (thus more thoroughly cooked), and here the tentacles were served pretty much intact. The flavors were right though, and maybe this is the way it's actually served in Greece? It's tasty so still worth getting, but it's a huge portion so you probably want to have at least 4 people in your party who love octopus if you're going to order this.\n\nI chose the spanakopita as an entree, and that was definitely excellent. The pita was clearly house-made (not ready-made phyllo-dough) and delicious, and the spinach filling was really well done. This definitely stacked up against plenty of the better homemade spanakopita I've had. Brad got the meat-eater's version, the kreatopita (which had chicken, pork and lamb). I've never seen that in a Greek home or restaurant before, so I'm guessing this was made, again, for American tastes. But it must work, because he liked it. Both dishes came with the horiatiki salad - yes, this is what Greek salad is supposed to be like!\n\nMoving beyond the menu, the decor reminded me a lot of the more minimalist Greek tavernas I've been to, though still with a good dose of Greek art and elements (wall tiles, prints, statuettes, etc.) I could heard traditional Greek music over the loudspeaker but the noise level mostly obscured it - the restaurant was PACKED. Lots of big parties, families, etc. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and the hosts and servers ran around frantically to make sure that was the case.\n\nSo I'm happy to now know a great Greek restaurant in Philly! Well, close enough - a Philly suburb. Since most of the Greeks I know seem to prefer the suburbs anyway, this actually makes sense. In the meantime, I still need to find a good Greek restaurant in the city itself (eventually).",

Lots of different rolls, but the nigiri selection wasn't great or compelling. \n\nThe little I tried of the hot food was pretty bad. Fried stuff tasted stale, everything else tasted bland. And $10 for a regular lunch buffet is pretty expensive anyway - it's not cost effective to use your appetite on the sesame chicken type stuff.\n\nIf you think about it, getting two sushi rolls from the grocery store will probably run you at least $10. You can eat a greater quantity and variety of sushi rolls for that price at Journey, which makes it a good value.",

  "text": "Really, 3.5 stars because I didn't know how to do a 1/2 star. We tried to join another party, they were unable to accommodate us unless we ALL moved to another table so I moved to the bar. Interesting layout as they have a second ring of 4 toppers AROUND the central bar. We got our first waters within 5 minutes of sitting without asking. Within 3 more minutes, our waitress appeared for drink and appetizer orders. Got our wines, (Xplorador, Chile) my glass was dirty and the pour was below my normal expectation of a normal pour. Didn't say anything. Appetizers come next. Got the slab cut maple bacon and the \"famous for\" shrimp cocktail. OUTSTANDING!!! If Ur a bacon and spicy shrimp cocktail lover, you MUST get this. WARNING: shrimp cocktail is NOT inexpensive. Waitress returns to ask if I want another glass of wine. Yes, I'm running low at this point. I tell her about the dirty glass and the \"poor\" pour. She says she'll tell the bartender. Glass arrived poured about 3/4 FULL! Now, THAT'S what I meant by a good pour! Main dishes come. We got the St Elmo's Prime Rib sandwiches with house onion rings and cut fries. The onion rings came with a spicy ketchup/cocktail sauce-VERY good! The sandwiches were excellent.  The meat was super tender and tasty. U could easily bite thru the meat after dipping in the au jus sauce. I liked the creamy horseradish sauce better tho. I ask for the bill. No room left for dessert. $110.00 pre tip for 3 glasses of wine, two appetizers (shrimp cocktail $35.00 alone) and 2 entrees. The servers were all attentive, the food VERY good, but the price I thought a tad on the high side.",

  "text": "I love this little place so very much.  Luckily, I work just a few blocks away so I have plenty of opportunities to purchase the delicious smoked meats before or after work despite residing in South Philly!  \n\nThe dude who works the front at this place is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodates customers to the best of his ability.  That alone makes me more motivated to frequent this spot.  You will always get personal treatment here whether it is your first visit or if you have been a long time customer.  \n\nOh, and the smell of the delicious smoked meats...I swear, I could wait in line forever if necessary as long as I can smell that smokey goodness all around me as I prepare to make my purchase.  Just imagine, the food you purchase will actually taste even better than it smells.   \n\nSo far, I have tried the bacon, kielbasy (garlic and breakfast to be specific since there is a great variety of kielbasy to purchase), and pierogies (3 cheese and the loaded potato types, to be specific as well).  \n\nBest bacon ever.  I love the places I frequent in the Italian Market in Philly and back home in rural NC, but the best bacon I've ever had in my life came from Czerw's.  \n\nWithout even being asked, the guy at the front took time to tell me the best way to cook the kielbasy and pierogies as he rang up my order.  He seemed invested in making sure I truly had the best possible food experience with the delicious Polish goods that I purchased. \n\nI have never been disappointed with this place.  If you are in this neighborhood, then definitely make a stop at Czerw's.  Check out the history of the place too by taking a look around at the pictures on the walls.  \n\nOh yeah, check this place out on the most recent episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, too.\n\n*Edit*\n\nThey totally welcome phone calls if you want to order anything by phone and pick it up later in the day.  This place will often sell out of items, such as the bacon.  If you are able to get there bright and early to ensure that you have the best selection of items, then do it, but if not, you should call ahead or else you will be S.O.L until next time.",

They have a little stash of books, magazines, and kiddy toys hanging out by the side so you can occupy yourself with that nonsense whilst waiting. It makes the time fly while you wait.

  "text": "So... I'd been to Kuzina a few times for lunch and thought it was OK so I went for a late dinner with my boyfriend last night. He's not a connoisseur of foreign foods so Greek was not familiar to him. I was excited to introduce him to the cuisine and know how delicious it can be, but was pretty disappointed by well, everything we got. The greek salad had a minimal amount of feta and WAY too many salty items on it. Olives - ok, that's pretty typical. Capers? well, sure whatever. but you cannot put olives, capers AND anchovies on one salad.. it's just too much. not to mention they were SO clearly canned anchovies which is kind of just gross.\n\nSecondly - we ordered the moussaka to share. I cook, and recently I took a stab at making moussaka myself. it was delicious, so i figured most greek restaurants would make it even better. Also - i thought it was kind of like lasagna which my bf likes, so I knew it'd be a hit. Well? not so much. It came with a side - we chose the green beans which were soggy and covered in what seemed like canned tomato sauce. And of course, then there's the actual entree. It was like a ground beef stew with eggplant mixed in.. ok normal enough there - but then it came with a literally 1/2\" layer of HARD THICK unappealing bechamel \"sauce\" (if you can call it that) on top. It seemed like it had been prepared a long time ago and was just heated up. And it was disgusting. When the waitress saw that we didn't eat much of it, she didn't say anything. I did - I told her it wasn't very good, that I know moussaka and this wasn't too great. I acted like I liked the salad so she wouldn't feel like all was lost.. but it didn't matter, she didn't really care. It was late and very clear that she just wanted to go home. \n\nThe worst part of the whole experience... my boyfriend and I both feel totally sick today, so we know SOMETHING in that disgusting meal had gone bad. We will not be back.",

  "text": "It was a rainy day. My family and I walked in and got seated immediately; we were table of 4. The server brought us a few waters to start. We ordered some appetizers to begin. The atmosphere was so quiet, I thought it was awkward. It was not at all packed, and I kind of wished they had more customers so there would be a more lively, dynamic atmosphere. I think the place overall was overpriced, but the appetizers were fairly priced. \n\nAppetizers: \nCoconut Shrimp\nMiso Soup\nAge Dashi Tofu\nThai Lemongrass Coconut Chicken Soup\n\nThe Coconut Shrimp was good and so was the miso soup. However, the Age Dashi Tofu was bland and the Thai Lemongrass Coconut Chicken Soup was not the best. We then proceed to order sushi and our entrees. \n\nSushi: \nCrunchy Roll\nHello Kitty\nSexiest Man Roll\nPuff Daddy\n\nEntrees:\nSalmon Hibachi with sauteed vegetables and white rice\nSingapore Rice Vermicelli\n\nAs for the sushi, the crunchy roll was superb, and I really recommend it if you like a plain, yet delicious roll. The hello kitty roll was the size of a diagonally cut sandwich and it was hard to eat with the chopsticks. Actually, I didn't know how I was supposed to eat it! Besides that, it was enjoyable. The sexiest man roll was acceptable, and my sister liked the sauce that was drizzled on top of the sushi! The puff daddy was adequate and my sissy and I really like the crunchy stuff on top! \n\nThe Salmon Hibachi with sauteed vegetables and white rice was excellent. I highly recommend this dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The sauteed onions compliments the salmon. The sauteed vegetables was great. The Singapore Rice Vermicelli was also delicious and I recommend this dish as well. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for a special event, but for casual dinner or lunch I would rather go to another place.",

Also, they were out of pinto beans (for the 2nd time), so the choices were cole slaw, spicy beans or 2 rice dishes - one warm, one cold. The place was filthy. We went all the way to the back of the store to find a clean table. Who's paying attention? For the time being, if we desperately need their tamales, we'll purchase them frozen (without sides) and bring them home to heat in the microwave. Besides at their  restaurants, Tucson tamales are available, for more money and without sides, at Whole Foods. That is where I first got them. Diane",

  "text": "I was looking to purchase an RV from one of the lines that they carry. I specifically told the salesperson she could only run my credit one time. They offer an incentive to go with their financing people, so I only did it as a courtesy. The saleswoman didn't write it on the buyer's order. Instead she wrote it on the negotiations form. She verbally assured me in front of a witness that my credit would only be run once.\n\nA few days later my credit was run several times. I called the saleswoman and told her to have the manager call me back. I received no response. I waited 2 days they were open before calling back. The finance manager then called me back and told me I can't control how many times they run credit despite my having it in writing.\n\nI filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. They reached out to the company several times with no response. Since they are NOT an accredited business there is not much else I can do.\n\nI spoke with the sales manager and he downplayed all the nefarious things that the staff said and did. I was upset at being treated so poorly after being lied to in the first place and they were rude and disparaging instead of helpful. I have no faith that they will make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.\n\nI purchased my camper from another dealer about 50 miles away from me. Everything was wonderful from start to finish. They were completely the opposite of this business.",

One table was open but still not cleaned and we waited for 5 minutes until I decided to clean the table. \nThe wings I ordered were dry and greasy. It seems they were cooked frozen. The curly fries were bits and pieces once I picked the top fries.\nWaitress did not ask if we needed anything else and we had to request for condiments. \nThis location would not still be open if it was not for Covid relief. I am done with it.\nWorst Hooters.",

For under $15 I had enough food to tak home to eat for dinner. My husband had a rigatoni dish that was also amazing and large enough for leftovers. Our total bill was under $30. \n\nAnother reason to go near closing on Sunday - on our way out we were given 2 free loaves of fresh baked bread that would have gotten thrown away. Score!

Each room has kitchen, microwave, large fridge, kitchen table, stove, sink, paper towels, plates. etc. Great for families. We had a nice view of the city from our hotel room. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of options. Fitness center was small but nice and clean and had standard hotel equipment with one elliptical, one treadmill, free weights, etc. Hotel is close to several restaurants. Kilroy's (bar/restaurant) delivers to the hotel, it is also right next to the hotel, therefore we walked a couple feet, and enjoyed a good dinner there. \n\nValet parking is the only option at this location and was pricey. We wanted to leave our car there until 3pm but had to take it out by 1pm or we would be charged for another day of valet parking ($30 bucks/day). This was inconvenient as other hotels have not charged us for staying in their lot 2-3 hours after checkout. \n\n\nOtherwise, staff and valet workers were very attentive and nice. Had a decent experience overall and this would be a nice hotel to stay at again in Indianapolis due to its great location downtown and proximity great shopping, restaurants, and Lucas Oil Stadium.",

  "text": "After driving by a million times (give or take a couple), we finally stopped here on a Friday evening for a quick dinner, and we are now fans. \n\nBased on Yelp reviews we ordered the Bavarian pretzel with Obatzda, the wurst platter and the mussels in beer.  The house-made pretzel had a thick, chewy exterior which was the perfect foil for the richness of the Obatzda.  The deliciousness was further enhanced by Mr. M's micro-brew and my light and bubbly hard cider.   I would have been content to stop right there.  \n\nMr. M ordered the wurst platter, which he declared excellent (not a surprise given the distinguished pedigree of the wurst).  What really sold him on the meal, however, were the handcut fries and spaetzle, which recalled Mom's recipe.   The mussels were uber-delicious (and comparable to Monk's), and only the rules of decorum prevented me from slurping the remaining broth. \n\nWe loved the intimacy that the low-lighting created in what is not an intimate space.  The service was attentive, efficient and patient with newbies.",

Bar was moderately crowded but extremely loud for the amount of people. Drinks were mediocre at best. Sazerac was underwhelming and Moscow mules were some of the worst I've experienced in Nashville. For the price I'd expect them to be on par with Morton's or the Oak Bar. \n\nSat on time, but took longer than expected for waiter to approach table. After trying the pickles and bell peppers, the bread came which was delicious. We decided on the smoked salmon and bacon as an appetizer. I must say the bacon may have been the highlight of the meal. It was deliciously prepared with a great sauce. Salads arrived and contained surprising delicious tomatoes, especially for the time of year. Going into the entree I had high expectations. However  my ribeye, although prepared fantastically visually (medium rare) lacked the flavor I typically expect from the cut of meat. My wife ordered the shrimp pasta which even though the shrimp was cooked well, lacked flavor. The best part of the meal was probably the skillet fried potatoes and gravy... absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall not a bad experience, but for the price and ambiance I'd much rather go to one of the other steakhouses in Nashville. Definitely worth checking out, if for nothing else then to reaffirm your favorite restaurant.",

  "text": "We love Bar Taco because of the energy and airiness in the dining room, but it took me about a year to really say I really liked the food. We went the first time about one week after they opened and I was annoyed at the prices. I thought everything was a bit too expensive for what you got. But over time I started to find items on the menu like their tamales and rice bowls that I really love. My husband loves their tacos and cucumber salad. He has loved them from day one, hence why we kept coming back. We also love their green salsa. We find the wait for a table usually too long, so we usually sit at the bar. Their drinks are all fresh juices. Everything about Bar Taco tastes very fresh. Eventually I got used to the prices vs food size and just enjoyed the food. The outside seating is not that comfortable but they do have a few regular tables that are nice.",

Lost seems to be a pretty typical neighborhood bar but you get the feeling they're just waiting for all the hipsters to move in and take over.  As I stood outside I could see that I could quite literally throw a rock and hit Philadelphia Brewing Company which may suggest why the PBC beers here are only 3 bucks.  Cheap beer = good times!  \nThe pool table was a buck a game and plays pretty nicely as a matter of fact!  Once the DJ came in around 11ish the party started - well at least in my head.  She was playing some great classic  70s metal and glam rock - yeah, pretty cool!  I'll be back Lost, don't go moving your island on me!!",

  "text": "I'm not much for writing reviews on Yelp; I usually only read others. However, I had such a terrible experience with this company that I actually feel obligated to write one (even though there isn't a single positive review anyway).\n\nI was in Santa Barbara for a dear old friend's wedding this past weekend. SIx of us needed to take a cab from our rental home to the Four Seasons. I called at 5 PM asking for a cab to pick us up at 5:40. The woman rudely informed me that they don't take orders for cabs in advance. Surprised, I said okay, and that I would call back in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later, I called back and asked for two cabs. The woman remembered me and was incredibly rude asking for my address and phone number. She said they'd be there \"momentarily.\" We used the opportunity to take some photos of us all dressed up for the wedding, but at 5:45 realized the cab was STILL not there (I had called at 5:20). We started to panic; I called back and the woman told me that the cabs were \"dropping off other customers\" and would be there in \"around 15 minutes.\" I was VERY peeved and said we would have to cancel our cab. We ended up having to drive ourselves to the wedding and leaving our cars at the hotel, meaning we had to go pick them up in the morning. It was so frustrating, considering we were only trying to be safe by taking a cab so that we could all drink comfortably. \n\nThis woman knew that I was trying to plan in advance, yet was incredibly incompetent and rude. I have worked in many different types of service industries and have never treated anyone with such disrespect, even if they were being rude. I can honestly say that I was not being short, rude, or annoying in any way, and yet she treated me with complete disregard. I wish I had gotten her name so that I could call the manager/owner, but based on other reviews it seems that this is not a good cab service at all. \n\nPlease take my advice and don't use this company. They are incompetent and incredibly RUDE!",

  "text": "This place is full of one health code violation after another! Originally when this place first opened up me and my coworkers raved about how good their burgers were! One day things happened to take a turn for the worst! My meat was tough and drenched in so much oil that the bread fell apart. They changed their fries from shoe string cut, to zig zag, and now to this thicker cut and none of them were ever crispy. I've asked them in the past to place my fries in a bag to keep them from getting soggy and eventually they started doing all of their orders like that, but now even in the bags they're still soggy. After not ordering from them for a few months my coworker and I went against my better judgement and decided to give them another try. By now hoping things may have gotten better plus I've never been to the actual location before. Before leaving my office I ordered my food on my Grubhub app. My office is 10-15 mins away plus we stopped to go to CVS for a good 20 mins so I figured that was ok because it's next door to the restaurant yet my food still wasn't ready once I got there. As I waited my coworker went and ordered a slice of pizza. They were busy so I waited and I waited in horror! The staff was all over the place and not a single glove was worn in site! I watch one employee take a rag and wipe food, paper and some rolls to the edge of the cutting board so he could prepare a pizza. That wasn't before he took that same rag and tossed it onto the roll which another employee proceeded to make sandwiches with! Next an older woman began making sandwiches along with the other young lady and because she was short she couldn't properly reach some ingredients she needed. She then proceeded to lean over the cutting board boobs mashed completely against the sandwich and once she had what she need she proceed to finish making the same sandwich! Mind you NOBODY was wearing ANY GLOVES! Between that and the pizza man rubbing his ungloved hands on his nose while making pizzas the cashier woman finally asked me had I been helped. I hesitated because I was in a state of shock but told her no and gave her my name. She couldn't find my food so I waited some more....Now I started looking at the food on the floor and then my eye began to watch the man on the grill. Jesus Christ where do I begin...well for starters a lot of cross contamination with the meats. Beef, steak and chicken prepared in the small spot on the grill and shoved off to the side. Cheese sat in a metal pan next to the grill melting and clearly not kept at the temperature it should be. I found out why my burgers have been so oily it was because the man was pressing the meats so hard against the grill cooking out all of the natural oils and grabbing this bottle of oil dumping it all over the meat. After waiting over 20 mins, my coworker asked if our food was ready. We were advised that her pizza was forgotten in the over and that my order wasn't anywhere to be found. I was finally able to get someone's attention and asked them to cancel my order because I couldn't stomach it. The young lady was ready to give me a refund and this old woman started yelling at her \"I told you her order was ready! The bag is right here!\" all while she's slamming my bag of food on the counter. The young lady still being polite says she didn't know and the old woman has now marched towards the kitchen and is yelling towards the girl speaking to a guy who I believe was the manager. I whispered to the girl \"If you're going to get in trouble for this then don't worry about it I'll just take the food\" she apologizes again and I got out of there. I get to work and the fries are soggy, the burger is burnt, tasteless, full of oil and the lettuce were wilted. I threw the whole bag out and proceeded to write this review...I will never go to this dump again!",

The rest of the car was still filthy. The windshield previously had a parking sticker under the rearview mirror with tons of residue left over. Another sticker had been removed that left so much glue, at first the salesperson and I both thought the windshield was cracked.  \nI drove the car anyway. They started the car and brought it around front.  I didn't see how they started it.  While testing it,  I turned it off and it wouldn't restart. I called them and told them the readout said \"key battery needs replacing\".  The manager came to restart the car, but instead of a battery for the key, he brought a portable jump box and jumped the battery. Why?  He again said it was the key battery....makes me wonder if it was something else.  \nBelieve it or not, I still was interested.  I took it back and told them I was interested, but needed them to clean the car, so I could really see it.  In the meantime I was going to look at another car. \nThe next day, I got a text. NOT A CALL.  A text telling me they would detail it for me to drive, but someone from out of state was putting a deposit on it. They said they'd give me first dibs.  Really?  At this point, I'm angry, feeling betrayed and a bit sad.  I told them to sell it to the mysterious guy from out of state.\nThe car was listed online for 54 days.

Your restaurant has attracted a good following in the area, please don't tick off people by adding extra charges for things that should be free.",

Not what I expected for this type of place and more over not what I expected when they are only serving a few at a time. \nI'll try somewhere else next time the wife and I want to go out. Not happy experience for $100 worth of food/service.",
