Also, carrying  a martini with your hands wrapped around the top was also a turn off, I am hardly a germ freak, but drinking from a glass that had someones hands around it is a bit disgusting.  \n\nWe will think twice about going back.",

Once I realized this was out of my price range,  I was looked at like I had three heads when I mentioned I could not afford the weight loss program they offered for me. I quickly became uncomfortable and left the appointment. A little while later, I received inappropriate text messages from the consultant asking what is wrong. I definitely do not recommend this place of business. I cannot speak if this place helps you lose weight but I can say that their sales tactics seem questionable. I will lose weight by exercising and watching my diet and will save money in doing so. All others, be warned.",

Sadly, the food is mediocre at best and for the price just not good. The wedge salad and the Mac and cheese are very good. The steak, oysters and baked potato no better than what you'd get at Outback. The spinach, or cheese with green stuff mixed in, is truly awful.  I'd say go to the bar for drinks but avoid the food.  Somehow 2 of us managed to spend $265, including tip, for a $75 meal. Sadly, not going back.",

He said no because the purchase already went through but told us we can use it next time.

Customer service is terrible, the floor (at least upstairs) is way under staffed and the staff that is on the floor is not super helpful. \nFor instance I was looking for a shirt for family pictures, I wanted a navy or red wine colored shirt. When I asked the lady (from whichever section NYDJ is sold) if they had any good navy or red wine colored shirts she said \"oh I'm sure there are some around, let me know if you find something and need a room\". Hmmm that's not what I was hoping for. \nThen there was an older lady in the shoe dept that had no knowledge of shoes and a super attitude! It was bizarre. \nThe staff that used to be there, like 4 years ago was awesome! Now it's sub-par. \nI hate to be like this but are the employees at Nordstrom aware they are there to help/serve us the customers? \nSo for the time being I will be ordering my (and family's) stuff Nordstrom online and will dread the days I have to make returns. \n\nNovember 2018\nI just don't understand this place. The majority of the people that work here have the worst attitude. The only ones I have encountered that don't seem to hate their job are the ones in the men's department and a few in the shoes. \nThe ladies upstairs in tbd and bp are just down right pissed off at the world. I walked around with my hands full of stuff I wanted to try on for over 10 minutes, then I had to ask for a room and a lady said \"yeah they are right there\" pointed me in the direction-didn't grab the stuff, or help in any way. I was so annoyed at the whole situation I scanned what I wanted and ordered it online just so no one got commission from me. \nNordstrom are you listening?

But today after brunch, we brought home a cinnamon roll for my daughter who couldn't come along with us. I snuck a bite and THERE WAS A BUTTON in the dough! \n\nWe called the restaurant and after being put on hold for a good amount of time, the acting manager came on the line and was less than sympathetic. His response to the situation was super awkward and borderline rude. He noted that the chef was wearing the same coat as he was yesterday when making the rolls and no button was missing (ok, ew - why no clean coat?!) but that they'd \"look into it\" and someone would call me tomorrow. (I had to ask him if he needed my phone number to call me back so not sure about the sincerity of that statement. )\n\nWe were polite and definitely are not looking for a handout, freebie, etc., just thought the restaurant should know that a customer bit into a button. Why not just take responsibility and apologize? Super disappointed with the way the situation was handled, and now feeling like the kitchen is less clean/sanitary than we thought. Thumbs down, Fork.

The crew brought it into the house unboxed the couch and put it together half way. Then hands me the clipboard and says sign for furniture. So I did and crew left. My husband and I put the furniture the rest of the way together and I noticed that the middle piece of the sectional was sagging in the back. So of course this place of business was closed to call anyone so we said we would call first thing in the morning on Monday. So I called and the gentleman I spoke to told me that there was nothing they were going to do because we shouldn't have signed for the furniture and asked if we purchased the warranty which we did and told us we needed to go through them to get the sectional replaced. I told the gentleman that I was floored that I would receive damaged furniture and have to make a warranty claim already. He said that how do they know that we didn't break the furniture over night I didn't even have the energy to fight with this gentleman. So my husband called the warranty company the next day and started a claim, the lady that was helping him said she was going to get into contact with the furniture store because if they delivered it damaged they needed to bring out a new piece. So after couple days of back and forth the furniture store said we were sol and warranty would have to cover it. Husband got back in contact with the lady that was helping him and she told him that they weren't going to replace it because the gentleman that she was dealing with at the furniture store admitted to her that the furniture was indeed BROKEN when it left the warehouse July 15th in the evening!!! So now we are stuck with a broken couch and no one to help replace or fix the couch.",

Floor is peeling up by their fake wood, which they will most likely try to charge us for even though it was like that the day we moved in. But that little compared to other issues.\n\nSince day one my wife and I experienced humidity levels in the 75-80% range. I told management a total of 3 times, which they never did anything about, because why would they do their job? The result of the humidity was MOLD starting to grow on decorations we have, which we ended up throwing out. The response I got from the complex was \"buy a dehumidifier\" or \"change the ac unit\". The ac units in the building are oversized ptac units which result in little to no dehumidification because they only sense dry bulb temps. Mix that with the cheap windows (I feel the draft coming in, plus a consistency of spiders I find in my apartment). Management said they would \"check on the humidity issue\" which they never have. And to management, the issue is fine now BECAUSE it's winter and there's a lack of humidity in the air. So that you for your \"concern\". But this will become an issue again in the summer. If you like to sleep comfortable do not live here. I can only imagine mold growing inside the walls this summer and us getting charged for it. \n\nNext issue,\n\nMy wife had been contacting the lady in the management office (I call her out because I don't know her name and she is the only one my wife has contacted) for our utility bill because we like to pay our bills on time. 2 months later it took a negative yelp review from her (which she took down because she is nice and the other lady who comments on these yelp reviews asked her to in exchange to waive the previous months utility bills we were waiting on). They finally sent us a bill, which was not waived, and as my wife fulfilled her end the manager who said she would waive it did not. We have all this communication in writing, and I might take this to court just for principle, because my wife also emailed her 4 times for verification the utility has been waived, but my wife has been ignored ever since she removed her yelp review (which is why I am doing one now). \n\nI have also been waiting for a parking pass for almost 2 months. The only reason that vehicle hasn't been towed is because security now knows my work vehicle. \n\nIf possible this would be zero star rating for this \"complex\". But because I can't, I guess the positive star goes to the front desk staff and security because they're always friendly and ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB. Maintenance as well, they always do their job well. \n\nThis is not all the issues I have just some of them. I would not recommend to move into this place. We are almost sure we will not be renewing our lease due to the multiple failures of management, and \"upper management\". \n\nTo the lady who comments on the yelp reviews and lied to my wife, you can be sure this review will not be edited or removed. Y'all have lied to us entirely too much for you to be trusted. And I have all your communication with my wife in writing too, which I may use as evidence. But for the time being, we are just going to pay our bills on time. And management stop giving my wife dirty looks or ignoring her because she called you out. \n\nDo not be fooled by the mimosas and smiles when you come in and look. The leasing office didn't even know the place takes money orders for rent payment (because paying online they just steal more money from you).",

So not only did my gf race home for nothin there was no delivery!!! No door tag on my door, no package. Get this, they stated we need an adult signature which is why we needed to be home. But last time we got this delivery it was left in a secure pickup box similar to an amazon storage self pick up. Why do we need a signature this time beats the hell outta me. \nWTF!!!

  "text": "Great Food, TERRIBLE Service. \n\n23\n\nYes, 23. That's how many servers passed me in the 7 minutes after being seated before one came to my table (of course, some of them were actually serving).  That put the experience off to a bad start, what with my low blood sugar and all. I was about to walk out, feeling snuffed and ignored, more so when the table next to me was immediately greeted upon seating.  \n\nWhen the server finally arrived to take my drink order, things began to look up. The Wisconsin Cheddar Bites arrived and were excellent!  Hot. Crispy. Tasty. Not quite worth the wait (because the wait was so long) but still delicious, with a tasty, chunky Marinara.  \n\nBut then another 23 minutes of waiting for my main course and then they got it wrong. Once they finally got it straight, the manager brought it out herself, IT WAS GOOD!  Tasty. Fresh. And Generous. The Baby Backs were fall-off-the-bone good (but still had the silver skin on) and the BBQ Chicken was done just right. Their Honey BBQ Sauce is very good, but you'll want to ask for extra. \n\nVicky, the Manager on Duty, checked on things and seemed to care, but still the Service left so much to be desired. Unfortunately, I didn't have a Penny to leave for a tip.",

  "text": "My husband and I went there for the 2nd time last night.  First time I would have given 4 stars so we went back there last night.  We asked to be seated outside since it was such a beautiful night.  Very small patio area, but nice - had plenty of TVs and, like I said, beautiful night.  When we were seated an employee had to be asked to get up so we could sit at the open table.  (He was there smoking and watching the cards game).  The employee then went to a large table with only 2 people sitting there and asked if he could sit there - they said yes.  Throughout my meal I could see this was the employee hangout, not the nice patio seating I would have enjoyed.  Even our waiter would come out and first talk with the group of employees before coming over to help us.   There were even people (I assume were employees) that would enter the patio from the parking lot and start joking around with the now over flowing, standing room only, table of employees - the couple that was sitting there had now left.  There were three other tables on the patio that were slowly emptying.  This meant that now the diners from inside could now come out to the patio for a smoke break.  I understand that the diners on the patio could smoke, but was a little frustrated that now there was a stream of people coming out to just smoke while we were trying to enjoy our meal and drinks.  I don't have a problem with other people smoking if they were there on the patio with us enjoying their meal, but the place turned into a literal smoke break patio.  \nWe would have continued to stay and had drinks had it not been more of a \"smoke break\" area.  Even employees would come out on their break (assumedly) and have a cigarette.  We had gotten there around 8pm and left shortly after 9pm.  So, this also wasn't  really late.  Glad I did not have my children with me, because the employees also had mouths on them that would not have been appreciated if my children were with me.  Bottom line - if you are a smoker and don't have a problem with a ton of people smoking around you while eating?  Sit on the patio.  If you're not - stick with inside.\nFood?  Meh.  I ordered the pasta con broccoli without mushrooms.  Pasta was dry with absolutely no flavor.  Looked like it came out of a box.  There were maybe 5 pieces of broccoli in it.  And pasta still had a few pieces of mushrooms - glad I'm not allergic.  Visit before that I got the steak salad - salad was great, but basically had to pick all the steak out - fatty and tough.  For the price?  Not worth it.  Husband got the unsmoked fish sandwich both times and liked it.  Fries were soggy and had barely any on the plate.",

Only put 1 star because it wouldn't let me submit review without choosing a star.\n \nMy family was due to stay at this Super 8 Reno location from June 29th through July 3rd with a group of our baseball team.  But before we arrived to check in, the team and coaches were very disgusted with the state of their rooms/facilities.  They were filthy and bugs were present inside the rooms, which is unacceptable for any human.  NOT a great atmosphere for our families to be around.  So I called while we were on the road to Reno and canceled our reservation.  Was told by Kayla, that I would still be charged for one night since I was canceling the day of check in.  Which mind you, I wouldn't be cancelling if your hotel was inhabitable!!!   Your cancellation policy should be waved, since the rooms were inhabitable to most human standards!!!!!   The boys even said there were prostitutes hanging around/staying!!!\n\nI was charged $85.87 for our none stay night.  Contacting their corporate office for a refund, we'll see how that goes???   \n\nThis hotel needs some corporate attention (I beat they wouldn't even stay) and Wyndham should be ashamed to put their name on this hotel.",

  "text": "Couldn't go last year and luckily had time this year to attend. Came by with two other friends who likes avocados and although I'm warned it is a small festival, it was a bit larger than I imagined. However, I still think it's just an average festival.\n \nWith the main selling point as an avocado festival, I imagined all the stands or vendors would have at least one avocado themed food. Several of them did not. This was off-putting to see since I would imagine the festival is just finding vendors to fill up spots and grow while not staying to the purpose of the festival. Aside from that, the avocado theme things I tried were the avocado beer, avocado tri tip sandwich, holy-guacamole with salted chips, avocado ice cream, and sampled the avocado cream pie. Kind of wanted to try the deep fried avocado, but I saw someone carrying it and decided that it wasn't worth it for that price. As a sum, the food is pretty much basic festival food. The only creative ones I liked trying were the beer, ice cream, and cream pie. The beer is IPA based and not overly hoppy - an easy to drink beer. Although, the cream pie and ice cream are overpriced for the amount given. I definitely wouldn't consider getting them another try due to the price point. The tri-tip was nice to have and enticing due to the smell, but it was just plain store-bought guacamole instead of freshly made guacamole. The holy-guacamole was severely overpriced for what it's worth. Other items such as elote (in a cup as well), hot dogs, tacos, fish tacos, and etc were sold as well. Avocado brownies were sold out unfortunately.\n \nThere were two avocado sellers and they were severely overpriced. If you are fanatical about it, go for it, but I rather buy them elsewhere at more normal prices. \n\nThere were goods vendors on site as well as a ferris wheel. There were several stages for live music and the festival itself spans 2-3 blocks. At the non-beach end of the festival, there was an educational booth about avocados where I thought should have been the main attraction instead of the food vendors. I enjoyed seeing all the different varieties of avocados and reading up some history.\n \nAll in all, if you like avocados, you'll still come to check it out. Be ready for overpriced food and not enough seating of course. I definitely think 1-2 hour at most - depending on how large your group is and how willing you are to spend money to buy the food. I can't wholly recommend it as a popular attraction, but if you are close or visiting the area, it's worth a check. I wouldn't plan a trip with this solely in mind.",

We had amazing service until Randy the lead waiter took over. He was way off for sure . Foreshadowing, he almost tipped over my wine glass. Thank goodness for Nick , he was amazing and made sure we had water and anything else we needed. Then captain Randy shows up. Don't most steak houses have you cut into your steak before you eat it? Well, that didn't happen here. Fast forward to dessert . When Randy asked what we would like for dessert, my daughter asked for the cookie cake, he left and came back and said well sorry. We ran out of That last night. Weird , don't you make your food fresh each day??? Ten minutes later, he says that he was mistaken , they DO have the cookie cake. Ok , so we get our dessert and have that and then we have been finished for quite sometime before Randy graces us with his presence again. When he does show up and all the dishes have been cleared, he reaches over and spills water all over my husband . No apologies. My daughter and I are handing him napkins and the awesome guy who brought us coffee and water helped get it all cleaned up. He is the one who actually apologized!!! We said. Well you didn't do it. Such a nice guy. Randy came back with our check though and still nothing mentioned about his crappy service. We were done by then. Way too many cool restaurants to go back to this one . Just no!",

They were looking at dresses as I past to go to the restroom.  I am a server and we are not even allowed to have our phones on us ( but we do and hide them) let alone on the floor for the customers to see. Ok on to the food. It was mediocre. I ordered the Benedict with biscuits sausage and gravy it said fried eggs instead of poached so I asked mine for scrambled. When it came the scrambled eggs look like it came out of the carton and not fluffy like real eggs and the taste was bland. I had to add hot sauce and pepper for some taste. The potatoes were good with the bbq sauce on it. The sausage was dry and my cousin did like like his always he said his was very dry..Not sure I will ever go back.

I did not originally know what all he was suppose to be doing as it was my fiancé who was planning to be there for the service. Shay said he would be there at 6pm so my fiancé would be home from work. He showed up over an hour early and I just happened to have gotten off work early. He tinkered around with the air handler in the garage for about 15 minutes before saying he was done and leaving (not before trying to sell me a $400 mold prevention). Upon my fiancé getting home shortly after Shay left, is when I learned he was suppose to add freon to the air conditioner on the side of the house (behind our gate) and clean the dryer duct. \n\nMy fiancé spoke to Shay on the phone who claimed he had done both of those things. I informed him Shay never went on the roof or went into the laundry room where the dryer was so he could not have possibly clean our the duct. He actually refused to go inside even after I offered to lock up the dogs for him. He also never went inside the gate where the air conditioner is located. When my fiancé called him out on lying he claimed our dryer doesn't exist (not that he would know since he refused to go inside). He also proceeded to say it was my fiancé's fault because he wasn't home over an hour before the scheduled appointment.\n\nDo not hire this company because you will get ripped off. We paid money prior to the service so now we are out our money and still have to call an AC company out to add freon and clean the dryer duct for our \"non-existent\" dryer.",

  "text": "I was visiting my girlfriend in Philadelphia and she made a reservation at Scarpetta because it was near her apartment and had availability on a Friday night. What was expected to be a pleasant Friday evening turned into an infuriating dining experience.\n \nTo start, we were seated behind a pillar and no one attended to us for the first 15 minutes. I noticed four Caucasian girls were seated behind us after us and were immediately greeted with menus and glasses of water. Our designated waiter realized we were waiting without menus after flirting with the four girls for a good 5 minutes. (Fred C.) had a look of -oh shit- written across his face. He finally came by with menus and asked what type of water we wanted.\n \nAfter taking our order, we still did not receive our water and two Caucasian girls were seated next to us. We finally received our water after they served us our drinks. Then, we noticed the girls next to us received their bread basket, and yet again, our table did not. Our appetizers came and still our bread never came. We had to bring it to the waiter's attention and THEN he immediately brought our bread basket over.\n \nIt was becoming difficult to feel like this was not an act of discrimination. We brought it to the attention of the manager and he responded with \"Sorry, it is really busy. We will give you an extra dessert.\" I am not sure why he thought dessert would fix everything and he completely ignored the fact that we felt neglected throughout the entire dining experience thus far. It felt like he wanted the dessert to shut us up and it would make up for all the mistreatment at a dinner I am paying for with my time and money. It seems obvious a restaurant would be busy on a Friday night, and so why was that an excuse? Did he want a pity party? Did he want us to sympathize with him and manage the restaurant for him? I've been to busier restaurants with impeccable service despite the crowds. (Honestly, it wasn't even that busy for a Friday night.)\n \nFinally, the bill came and instead of charging my girlfriend and I for the glass of wine we ordered, he charged us each for a bottle. I was livid and done with the entire experience at that point. I probably should have walked out the first 15 minutes. Safe to say I will not come back just to pay to be treated with negligence for an hour of my life I will never get back.",

  "text": "This restaurant was highly recommended to us by many, many people. We were very excited to try it out one day while we were at Indie flea market. It was very crowded but that seems to be the norm. We were seated after about 20 minutes and from there the experience worsened. We have to say this may be one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We had extremely long wait times in between our server stopping at the table. There were employees everywhere but it still seemed to be slower than ever. Our food took over 35 minutes to get to us and we had only ordered two sandwiches and a cup of soup. When our food came, we asked for ketchup. The server said she would go and get some, however, she never came back. We waited about 20 minutes and held off on the fries, ha ha, and finally asked a staff member that walked by for some ketchup. That person said they would go get some. But again they never returned... So over 30 minutes later we asked our server for a second time for some ketchup. It came to us about five minutes later. It confused us because all of the sandwiches were served with fries, yet they did not have ketchup anywhere handy. They had to go back into the kitchen to get the little cup of ketchup. After our plates had been taken away when we were done with our food, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our waitress to come back to give us the check. we never were even offered drink refills. Not even for water. we saw our waitress standing off to the side talking with another employee and giving us a weird look. We didn't really know what that was all about because we hadn't made any complaints. Finally , we waved someone down who got our waitress to give us the check. She was very rude and just dropped the check on the table and walked away. We really don't know what was going on the day that we went. It seems like they were staffed appropriately. We do not intend on going back here, as there are many other options in the area that we would rather go to that have nicer / more attentive employees.",

  "text": "We've had good and bad experiences with Olive Garden. It's becoming less of a value as their menu prices seem to be increasing more frequently. \n\nLast night my family and I had dinner. Kris was our server. She was off from the start; seemed confused or something. I think every step of the way she made mistakes, not just with our table, but the party of 8 adjacent to us. The manager comped some of their food, but I guess word of the poor service we experienced didn't make its way to the manager's attention. I decided it just wasn't worth it.\n\nWe finished our meals and asked for (2) to-go containers. Kris brought back 7 of them! She then watched as I combined two entrees into a single container and when I looked up, she was shaking her head and said they weren't going to fit. Well, they fit and I had plenty of room left over. Now, what was I going to do with the extra to-go containers? And, why the hell did she bring so many in the first place?\n\nWhen we were finished, Kris asked if we paid our bill already. I told her no. How could we? Upon leaving, I paid our bill while Kris hovered over me watching me getting ready to apply the tip at the table kiosk. I looked up at her with a quizzical look and then she explained how the slider looked. I told her I was very familiar with it. \n\nThe total price of our bill, including tip, was around $51. I mistakenly left without a receipt. On the drive home I calculated our three entrees and my daughter's milk. It came to ~$43 with tax and tip. It didn't add up. I'm thinking now we paid someone else's bill.\n\nThe funniest thing was when Kris brought a tray to clear some of our dishes, she left in right in front of my wife's chair, not allowing her to get up. Kris walked away and my wife squirmed out of her seat.",

  "text": "We went to this place because of its great reviews and historical location. The atmosphere is great. Subdued lighting, chandeliers, and tasteful decor. The food is another story. The food is mediocre at best and the portions are too small for even women with small appetites. I ordered the butternut squash pasta, which consisted of 3 noodles (no exaggeration), this greasy sour cream tasting butter sauce, shavings of kale, and 5 tiny pieces of squash ($17 and barely a side dish; rating 3/10). Their beer seems reasonably priced ($5-6) but is served in a half pint glass, which they fail to mention. I realize that this place is going for the fancy upscale vibe, but at least call it what it is....small plates, so people realize they will have to buy at least 2 to make a meal. Of note, my sister said her pasta, some pesto and pork thing, was \"okay\" so maybe some of their dishes are mediocre. However, I wouldn't pay $17 for 3 mediocre noodles. I gave them 2 stars for the nice atmosphere and staff.",

  "text": "Since my favourite pasta place in Edmonton closed, I've been looking for a new go-to pasta place that serves fresh pasta. I tried the gnocchi and the rotini dishes and was slightly disappointed. The rotini was essentially pasta that I could have bought at the grocery store. The gnocchi was homemade and very fluffy but the sauce just didn't wow me. The cheese also just came in a pile shredded on top. \n\nThe restaurant didn't open till 5, so we called and made a reservation on their answering machine. When we came in, we were told that they do not take reservations over the phone even though on their website it says they take reservations for parties of 6+. The waitress was friendly and patient with our larger group and we got good service.",

  "text": "We usually don't eat at Wing Stop, but I was craving some wings on this particular day -- sometime last week. We ended up with the meal deal of 25 wings with 3 different flavors and one of each sauce.\n\nWe ordered online and I went to go pick it up. When I was called up to the cash register the girl asked for my name and then began to read me what I had ordered. I confirmed that that was my order and she grabs the bag from behind her, puts it down and starts to rummage through it. I thought, well maybe she's now going to just verify they got everything. Finally, she starts pulling out these sauce containers -- about 6 of them, two of each flavor. She then wrinkles up the bag closed and pushes it toward me. I go, \"well, what about those?\"\nHer: \"Well, you got one of each sauce, right? That's what your receipt says. So, those are just extra\"\nMe: *starts looking back in the bag* \"well, there's just 3 containers in here...\"\nHer: \"Yup!\" *and starts walking away.\n\nMaybe for 25 wings, customers are only allotted 3 containers (1 for each flavor), but even if that's the case, you clearly knew that there were \"extras\" in there -- maybe a staff keeps making that 'mistake' or whatever the case may be that led you to open my bag of food -- but why do I HAVE to pay the price of your grimy hands, that has just touched the register/money/ect., in MY FOOD to pull out measly sauce containers that apparently shouldn't have been in there in the first place!? If there's extra in there, then let it be and train your staff better!\n\nSo disgusted by not only this lack of consideration, but also the blatant rude response to my inquiry and the obliviousness of her gross conduct.\n\nAlso, the wings did NOT cure the craving; I would have rather had McDonalds chicken nuggets.",

  "text": "How it has 4 stars is an absolute mystery. I, along with many people, was looking forward to a new casual spot in the village- and seafood to boot! For some reason a good, casual (or otherwise) restaurant is an obvious gap on a street 3 blocks from the ocean. Frankland's absolutely blew a golden opportunity. My first meal there I ordered local crab. Not much meat in there and no proper tools to appropriately extract the overpriced, poorly seasoned, crabmeat. Really, disappointing on all fronts. It was an utter mess. I grew up on the water  I know how it's done and this isn't it. It's as if they thought people (maybe because it's Montecito and people on vacation) would just roll over and pay the price. Fool me once... And almost twice. I went in this evening after a couple of months of driving by and seeing few, if no, people eating there, because I just really wanted to treat myself to  some crab legs but didn't want to drive the extra few minutes to the pier or East Beach. Lucky's, Honor Bar and others are packed, Frankland's is empty. I walk in and see Alaska crab legs 70-something dollars (20 less elsewhere) and not a soul to be seen in the kitchen or front register. If your struggling, make it easier, not harder for people to choose you. I waited a full minute, that's a long time when no one is in the restaurant. Last straw. I wanted to support them, I wanted them to succeed but you have to earn it with food and service, Frankland's has succeeded at neither.",

  "text": "I was able to try this food truck at the Tampa grilled cheese fest. I'm so disappointed in the service I received. To start i walked around and caught interest in this food truck being the line was not as long as the others and some of the menu items seemed as if they would be good. I understand that there's a lot of people so wait time would be a issue so I waited about 20 minuets to place my order then about 20 minuets to get my order. But in that time the lady in the truck kept yelling out and messing up the names to orders as well as informing everyone there running low on stuff. I'm upset to see the price jump in the menu being what was posted very recently in a review compared to what's posted for this festival. The prices just don't make sense for the product there putting out. I had got the gambino grilled cheese and the Eliot's untouchable fries. The grilled cheese was so small for $7. The fries where such a small portion and barley coated with there seasoning and as far as \"hand cut\" goes the fries where just frozen fries out of a bag. I was looking forward to trying the secret homemade fry sauce the most with my meal and I'm disappointed that the fries come with a small cup on the side maybe .5 oz container all for $3 bucks. After spending $11 on a meal and still starving I sadly won't be returning here in the future.",

Why is it so hard for this location to make food of the same caliber as every other location? They probably would have just had to cook my enchiladas for another 2-3 minutes. What a joke.",

While Renee did the best she could, she was late taking me back (5:10) and I want a deep tissue and it wasn't close to that in touch and pressure. Moreover, she used a vibration machine and a tens unit more than her actual hands. The receptionist was also not very warm upon check in and check out. I'm saddened because I use to love this place but I'm going to have to go somewhere else because $50 is a lot for massages that are subpar and a checkin that is not friendly.",

  "text": "I brought my Honda Civic in for inspection in November 2017. While my car passed inspection, I was strongly encouraged to get rear brakes ASAP. When I told the Service person I needed to think about it (as it was very costly), he aggressively put on the sales pressure, showing me graphics and telling me about hot spots. The \"Service Specialist\" made me feel that I was making a grave mistake for not getting my brakes done that day. I declined the service, mostly because I resented being spoken to like I was a child. Fast forward 8 months, I brought my car to another garage to look at the brakes. The mechanic said, \"While I would love to take your money, you don't need rear breaks right now. I would put my wife and children in your car, and feel safe.\"  While I bought my car at Scott, I will NEVER return there to service my vehicle. It's clean and slick there, but not worth the extra money and aggressive/deceptive/condescending sales for unnecessary service.",

  "text": "I had really high hopes for this place and altered my route down to Baltimore to come here, but I was disappointed in the meal.\n\nThe barbecue itself was my main problem with the place.  I got the brisket meal and added on the ribs for $5.  The brisket was actually really dry and mealy.  Instead of being neatly sliced, it was this mound of brisket that sort of fell apart, but not in that tender delicious barbecue way.  There wasn't really much smoke flavor at all.  The ribs were also really dry.  They were cooked to the point of being closer to jerky than the \"one-bite-and-clean-off-the-bone\" texture that ribs strive for.  These ribs actually took some doing to get the meat off the bone.  Part of the problem was that the silver skin was never removed off the ribs before smoking.  So it was a really tough skin to chew through and get meat off of.  I don't think I've ever been to a barbecue place that failed to remove the silver skin.  Aside from that, there wasn't much smoke flavor and there didn't seem to be any seasoning except for the dry rub sprinkled on after smoking.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was decent, although a bit too thin of a cheese sauce for me.  I was surprised at how much lobster meat went into it.  They actually included quite a few pieces of lobster tail meat and only a small portion of the claw, which is great since the claw is often that spongy texture stuff that tastes sort of strange.  The mac and cheese itself didn't have much lobster flavor, so it was more like lobster put into normal mac and cheese.\n\nI did like the German potato salad.  The potato was fried to perfection.  It was piping hot, crispy, and well-seasoned.  The sliced onions in this helped freshen it up.\n\nWith Yelp check in, you get a free smashade, which is a lemonade with real fruit to flavor it.  I tried the NJ peach and the blueberry+ginger.  The peach one was pretty good.  The blueberry and ginger one should have been strained to remove some of the blueberry and ginger skins.  I felt the lemonade itself wasn't lemony enough and the tartness didnt' come through.\n\nThe best part of this place is that they sell all  of Boylan Bottling Company's offerings, including the flavored seltzers and even the shirley temple.",

  "text": "I obtained high pain in my left leg, in the thigh and knee area. It wasn't severe enough to go to the hospital but enough to get in the way of moving around easily. I decided to use Lyft to go to Walgreens and come back home but I didn't want to run the risk of having my Lyft driver leave so I called the customer service number for Walgreens. I asked the representative/employee if it was possible for someone to bring a specific product that I wanted from the floor/shelf to the cashier counter so that when I get there, I could just pay for it and leave without spending much time in the store. She then connected me to someone in the store. I asked the same question and she then put me on what I thought was a hold. Instead, she  hung up the phone. Thinking that it was a mistake, I requested the Lyft and went to Walgreens. I limped my way in there and found an employee who wasn't doing much of anything and asked if this product was at the cashiers counter and instead of checking the counters, she just said that she didn't know what I was talking about and suggested that I talked to someone in the photo section. THE PHOTO SECTION. The lady in the photo section was already helping someone else didn't know what I was talking about so she called for someone to assist me. I stood there for at least five minutes. I became nervous of my Lyft driving possibly leaving me soon so I decided to limp my way around the store to find a knee brace. I found it and told the lady in the photo section to not call for someone else for the third time (she called for assistance a second time while I was looking for a brace) because I already found one. Luckily, the employee that I spoke to after entering the store rung up a previous customer and so checkout wasn't long. Overall, I would have rather someone tell me that I couldn't have someone bring a product from the floor to the cashier counter over the phone or the employee that I originally spoke to take a FEW minutes to check the counters than to not have no assistance at all. BAD customer service.",

  "text": "Okay I normally don't do this but now I'm frustrated.\n\nLong story short, I know makeup. I've done makeup for weddings, proms, models, etc. My specialty is skin/complexion, so I KNOW the difference between warm/cool/neutral foundations. With that said, I went in today because I had a coupon and wanted to get some more foundations.\n\nAgain, I know my undertones. So I began talking to the NARS rep and decided to purchase the sheer glow foundation-one of my favorites. I told him I wanted one shade just slightly darker than my skin because I get spray tans but that I still wanted it to be in the warm/golden family-I then pointed at the shade Punjab because I've owned it before and know it's my perfect shade. He then questioned me and said \"um you mean something with a rosy/cool undertone then? Because Punjab is rosy and a warmer shade will be too yellow for you.\" This was after I told him I do makeup, so it came across a bit demeaning-as if I don't really know what I'm talking about. I kind of just nodded my head and said \"sure\" because I didn't want to come across mean, but I was confused. He then put Punjab on me and just like I said, it matched me perfectly. I ended up purchasing Punjab and their concealer in the shade cannelle. He kept referring to them as \"rosy\"\n\nWhen I got home, I immediately googled the two shades on NARS site to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and they are described as \"golden\" and \"peachy\" (see attached photos).\n\nSo why am I writing this? 1. Because although the NARS rep was nice, I didn't like his comments 2. If you're going to have a NARS rep at your store, he/she should at least be able to properly tell the difference between undertones and not improperly refer to shades as being something they are not.\n\nAll in all, my experiences at this location have been way too hit or miss for me to definitively give them more than 2 stars. Sorry Ulta, but until you get your act together I'm officially done visiting your Elmwood location.",

The restaurant had a live Spanish singer & the entertainment was greatly appreciated while we waited for our entrees. The menu was full of choices. I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo & my friend ordered a Macho Burrito. We both disliked our food. My rice was way over cooked & super mushy. My black beans were cold although they did have a decent flavor. Due to the temperature not even being warm I didn't eat them for fear of food poisoning.  The worst part of my meal was the chicken. The sauce had no flavor and was super thick. It's almost like they added too much cornstarch or flour to thicken it & then tried to fix the mistake with extra water. It was nasty. The chicken also lacked flavor. They definitely didn't season the chicken prior to cooking. My chicken was bland & chewy. Maybe it was boiled...who knows. Whatever they did it was totally not eatable.\n\nMy friends burrito was another disappointment. The meat had a weird taste to it, almost sweet. They also used really low quality beef because there was a ton of grease. Their rice was also over cooked & mushy. The refried beans literally had hard clumps. It looked as it the beans had big burnt chunks of refried beans that were mixed it to good beans. And worst of all the burrito wasn't even warm in the center. This restaurant needs to really work on food temperature or they could seriously make someone ill. \n\nWe both only took small bites of our food & certainly did NOT ask for to go boxes. It's sad paying 12.75 & 10.29 for 2 dishes to be 95% thrown away. We certainly will never go back.  It's sad to say it but Taco Bell would have been better.",

  "text": "We visited Lulu's last month and thought it was good enough for a revisit. Folks, this is just an average place. Nothing is going to make you go \"Wow\". After going round and round the parking lot for 10 minutes on a Friday night, looking for a parking spot, we spotted a family leaving and had to block traffic so we could get the spot.\nWe had to wait for a table so we found 2 seats at the bar at the very end where the servers pick up drinks for the customers. The servers are mostly very young and very friendly. But, they all could use some training. When drinks were ordered, the fruit garnish is handled by their unsanitary hands. One male server actually held a wedge of lime for a few minutes before his drink order was made. Gross.\nWe ordered  a beer and a fuzzy navel. The heavyset barmaid did not look like she was in a good mood. Her tattoos and dyed black her were not an inviting outfit for the beach crowd. She made us a hairy navel (added vodka) instead of a fuzzy navel and did not even add a garnish to the drink. Luckily, I reached over in to the garnishes and added a dried out wedge of orange.\nWe paid out bar tab and were seated. The table and chairs were dirty. I had to wipe the crumbs off of the chair. When we came in, I was in the mood for raw oysters, but after seeing trays of pre-shucked oysters on display when we walked in, i changed my mind. While using pre-shucked oysters for cooked oysters dishes is ok, raw oyster enthusiasts long for the nectar of the fresh shucked mollusk. Seeing dozens of shucked oysters on display in the open air without being covered (Dept of Health regulation) and knowing that the melted ice could contaminate and alter the taste was a total letdown. If you are calling yourself an oyster bar, be an oyster bar!\nOk, so I did not order raw oysters. I opted for the fried grouper cheeks, which were not. They appeared like fried grouper bites. For $15, the portion was extremely small. What a ripoff! Even, my side of grilled vegetable were not grilled. They were soggy batons of sautéed squash that tasted like they were sitting in a steam table for too long. Yikes!\nNow for the dessert, since it was the special, we order the key lime pie. Oh well, we were told that that was not any left. OMG!\nThe highlight of the meal was my partners fried chicken, sweet potato fries and poppy coleslaw. All tasted very good!\nAs a former chef and restaurant owner my opinion is that unfortunately, the average person does not possess enough culinary aptitude to know what is good and what is average. Lulu's could be so much better if the focus was on quality, not quantity. Apparently, the kitchen needs a passionate owner and leader who has adequate culinary training or needs to hire a real chef who can teach the proper culinary techniques to the kitchen staff.\nI hope for the best for Lulu's. Spring break is over and the snow birds are leaving. How will you survive off-season? I will never return. Good luck!",

I do think it is a healthier choice as well as saving the animals.\nWith that said, I found V Street to be very uneventful and have crossed it off my list.\nWith so few menu options, you would think that the ones they do offer, would be over-the-top, not so.\nThe 'Tofu Scramble' would be the only acceptable item on the menu. Other than that, nothing was of interest.\nI was there with a party over a dozen, I saw and tasted all items.\nThe presentation was not inviting, unless you like bare minimalism. The food was too spicy to a fault, and I like spicy food. Even the Bloody Mary was followed by water.\nIt was just overall bad.\nWould rather have ordered from 'Whiz Kids' that adjoined the restaurant, but wasn't allowed. \nThis is the first review that I have ever given such a poor review, I'm sorry, but I'd rather eat anywhere else Vegan, than V Street.",

They charged me for potatoes, which usually are never charged for vegetarians.. she had a poor attitude and kept laughing at me for no reason.. I also asked for extra potatoes since they usually only put a few in my burrito, and I wanted to make sure I had plenty.\nNext, I roll up to the window, and pay with 5 dollars. My total was 4.76, and I only received 2 dimes as change.. not too bothered by it, but come on! I can hear rap music in the back and it was LOUD. It smelled like smoke. Like cigarette smoke. I couldn't believe my nose, but trust me, it was 10:02pm, and I smelled pungent smoke from inside with teenagers in there. I asked for a manager but no one was on duty.\nWhen I got my food, my burrito looked tiny. I felt around and only felt potatoes on 1/3 of the burrito only on one side, and I felt the rest of soft. When I ate it, I was completely right. Next, the nachos were a mess. It looked like someone sneezed all over it! It was all over the bag, the container, it really showed how much they cared.\nI would've taken my $5 and put it to better use at the McDonalds across the street. I hope to get something in return for such poor service.\n\nUPDATE 1/7/18\nWent in at 10:15 for just chips and cheese. The guy over the intercom kept asking if I wanted anything else, and after saying \"no\" about 5 times, he started laughing and told me to go to the next window. I come up and he starts laughing his butt off with his friend. I open up the cheese to see it all extremely chunky. I find that the chunks are some sort of powder and even some beef. My mother ordered these, she couldn't eat them because she is vegetarian. Cheap food, but a waste of my time even driving out here. Try McDonald's across the street for a snack, always fresh and accurate with good customer service.",

  "text": "My experience at Trolley Car Cafe was sub-standard. When I arrived with my party, it was unclear where we were expected to wait for a staff member to seat us - it turned out, the waiting area was the tiny entryway. There were very few diners in the restaurant, which made our standing in the doorway so apparent that another guest found a server to inform him that there were people waiting to be seated. The sparse decor was bizarre, to say the least. In the small areas where there was decor, it was crudely hung and very cheap looking. I ordered a burger, which was not cooked properly. It was well-done, but I ordered it medium. Additionally, the burger that I ordered was named specifically after a type of cheese that it featured. I was deeply disappointed that the cheese was cold on top of the burger - a clear indication that the cheese was an afterthought in the kitchen. The patty itself was far too small for the bun that it was served on. The poorly cooked and bland burger was something I was willing to look past, but I simply cannot understand why my burger was inexplicably served with a few plain tortilla chips. I took the chips home to eat with some salsa from my fridge and tried to ignore that I paid $13 for a sloppily made, over-cooked, bland burger with a side of tortilla chips.",

Over the past decade, STL has been making headway in the culinary scene, therefore we go out for dinner frequently when back in town. \n\nWe were in the neighborhood Christmas Eve, and with most restaurants closed on the 24th, we figured we would give this place a shot. To keep this review concise, come for the drinks, and do yourself a favor by forgoing the food. This was unequivocally the most poorly executed meal (and over-priced dining experience) I have had over the past 15 years of experiencing cultures through food in 15+ countries and 20+ US states. For example, the $40 scallop risotto was literally inedible-- scallops were extremely chewy, which means either overcooked and/or not fresh; dish was dry, when it should be a creamy consistency; extremely bland flavor. Given it was Christmas Eve, we opted not to say anything to the waitress or manager to keep things festive and lighthearted. \n\nTo conclude, takeaways of this review:\n\n-Exuberantly over-priced food relative to what it is \n-Poorly executed dishes\n-If you visit at all, I would recommend only the drinks",

Everything was fine until I got the bill. Both dogs got the rub down, I guess she was feeling for lumps. She looked at their teeth and paws. Check up was done for both dogs in less then 5 minutes.  Each of my dogs got 2 shots. Decided to buy her heartgard medicine and nextgard my bill was over $850.00.  We waited 40 minutes to get into room to see vet and in less then 20 minutes we were done and hit with an outrageous bill.  My dogs had operations that cost less then a yearly checkup and some meds. I only bought 2 boxes of meds not even enough to cover 6 months for both dogs. Why so expensive???? Cause your in Richboro??? Really????? Won't ever go back here.  Also when I got home I looked up the meds I bought online to compare prices.  To my surprise (lol not really) they cost $50-$75 more per box then I could of got online.  There is something to be said for jacking up the prices of meds after the exam was also so inflated.  Find another vet these people are thieves!!!!!!!!",

So, now...we will stick around to see what happens.  One can only hope things get better. \nI am not trying to put anyone out of a job, but the phone and front desk is the FACE of your establishment. And you NEED to know she is ruining your reputation.  I just don't think working with people is her forte by any means. \n\nBut that's just our opinion(and my parents as well, but I won't get into that lol, they are Italian and very opinionated lol)",

  "text": "Traveling with young children is always complicated because they need their own space but are too young for certain setups. For this reason, we opted to stay here during our seven day trip.\n\nThere is only one good thing about this hotel and that is the parking staff. The parking staff is amazing; I was sad to say goodbye to them. Other than that, our stay at the hotel wasn't very impressive. First of all, they charged extra during the holiday (which is to be expected) but had VERY minimal staff. Which means we paid extra but did not get the same level of service. The maid, while she was there, didn't clean the rooms she only gave clean towels. Though I don't celebrate Christmas, I can understand other people wanting to be with their families so that would not have been a problem. But why have her there for normal work hours and then just have her going around handing out towels? Makes no sense.\n\nThe breakfast area was very inefficient and understaffed as well. The staff was so overworked, one of the servers walked by with the coffee dispenser and hit my 3 year old son in the head. Who does that? I spoke to the manager and he barely seemed phased by this happening. They did end up giving us the regular rate instead of the holiday rate, but I don't really feel like that's sufficient. She hit him so hard he just stood there stunned. I ended up having to bring him back upstairs because clearly it's not a safe environment for children.\n\nAnother thing that threw me off is the fact that the hotel allows dogs. I'm not even one that dislikes dogs, but I really would rather not hear them bark all day long. While the hotel was easily accessible to the beach, I probably will stay elsewhere.",

Cut to an hour and a half later, our server hadn't come back to the table even once since we got our drinks and we had heard multiple arguments from the kitchen staff in which cursing was involved. To make matters worse, there were children around. The whole restaurant went quiet at one particular moment when a served screamed the F/bomb in search of his food. Meanwhile the manager has been in the kitchen this whole time letting this go on. We finally asked for our check and left without ever getting our food.

This place lists itself as \"Southern.\"  In New Orleans we kinda know what \"Southern\" means.  This was not it.  On entering we were greeted with Hip Hop music.  With children in the room the word \"fuck\" was heard repeatedly on the radio station they were playing.  Not a good start and not a good choice.  The music one plays in a restaurant does matter.  \n\nThe room gives one the impression of a \"Southern\" motif if some old windows and signs suffice.  The room is pleasant enough.  But the menu is where perplexing really makes itself known. Yes, grits did appear and there was evidence of Pimento cheese.  But \"Korean\" bowls and burgers?  Really?  Nothing against Korean but this was supposed to be Southern.  \n\nMy companion ordered the brisket, not usually considered Southern, and found the slices cut too thick and the meat tough and dry.  He found the cole slaw had potential but was way, way too salty.  He didn't eat it.  The beans appeared dried out though they did have an intriguing taste.  I ordered the short ribs.  The meat was tender enough to use a fork but the whole thing was served in a bowl with tasteless grits and a (I presume) Korean sauce with greens on the top.  Odd.  I got rather tired of it before I was finished. \n\nThe plain truth is that there are plenty of places to go for \"Southern,\" in New Orleans and this is not one of them.  We walked out not only perplexed but wondering why we bothered.",

Really, the staff gets in the door at 11am and start answering phones at 11:30.\n\nI ordered three large pies for my office. Two pepperoni, one plain. I received one plain, and two sausage with bacon. One slice looks like it was bitten by a mouse. The other pie has a hole in the middle. How is this even acceptable? \n\nI called to inquire about our order, and I was told by Dave, \"We're making your pizzas now. I didn't have pepperoni.\" \n\nIf you don't have pepperoni, you should tell your customers you don't have pepperoni, and offer a substitute. Don't just assume that sending over a different pizza is acceptable. \"My truck didn't show up, and we were busy,\" is not an appropriate response. That's an excuse. \n\nI used to work in the food service industry, and I realize mistakes happen. However, this could have easily been avoided had the truth been told. Don't make excuses or pass the buck. Own up when you make a mistake. \n\nI have given Amy's Pizzeria the benefit of the doubt many times. Each time, the order is not quite right, but this most recent experience is unforgivable. I won't order from here again.",

  "text": "We had been looking for a reason to stop and try this place, so we were stoked when we finally got to stop in about 7 on a Tuesday evening. \nThere was only 1 other family of 4 in the dining area. We settled on two simple pepperoni's, an Athenian, and a Five Star, and made combos of 3 of those. Two people solemnly greeted us at the pizza station. They both appeared as though they either disliked their jobs, or life in general. We ordered one at a time, and it was a painfully slow process. \nWe stopped for drinks, and what a mess! It made me stop and look around and the multiple dirty tables, nasty floor, and overall unclean surroundings. It made me wonder why two people were making pizza, and not one person was cleaning up. But, hey...on to the food. \nThe pizza was so-so. The crust was good, but it really had minimal toppings, and the Athenian was missing a few all together. Even the salads was limp and small. For the cost, it really wasn't worth it. \nWe all figured we'd hit the head before the long ride home, which was also an eye-opener. The bathrooms were just as dirty as the dining area.\nPerhaps another location would be better, but this location is not one we'd return to for sure. I think we'll see what the one opening in the Boro is like next time, before we give up hope.",

I didn't even taste it because it looked disgusting which my friend confirmed. The biscuits and gravy had 3 different types of sausage, one being hot sausage. It was horrible. The pancakes were pancakes, whatever... we left without eating and went to get breakfast somewhere else. $40 down the drain.  Biggest disappointment meal ever. It was my friends last meal before going to the airport to leave NOLA. The one good star is because the people were nice.

I had one of my favorite signature Vietnamese dishes, the Bun bo Hue. I can not say I liked it at all. The broth was nothing to write home about and around 10-15 slices of bo chin. It was very difficult to finish it all...it's nice to have more meat than noodles (lol) but maybe some homemade cha, oxtail or pig feet. \n\nOtherwise, nothing out of the ordinary for a Vietnamese restaurant on their menu. Their coffee was very large but wayy too much condensed milk. It's nice for Americans since we love our large coffees but Vietnamese coffee is an exception. Smaller cups, less condensed milk please. :)\n\nI may come by again but I have a lot of other options (why I moved here) both in Camden county and in Philla. Hope to see some new pictures of a new an improved Bun bo Hue and perhaps some dishes. I'd love to see a well made bun rieu or bun mam.",

My room was so outdated that I'm positive people who stayed in it are dead now. Worn baby pink carpet, dim lighting, and a 1994 TV is just the start. The wall paper is floral and the artwork is old western themed. In the sink area there are  fake flowers on the wall and gaudy gold hardware. I feel like I'm sleeping over at my Grandma's in the 70s. The faucet gurgled and spit water aggressively when I turned it on. The towels are rough and scratchy. There's an old telephone hanging by the toilet. Everything is reminiscent of a horror movie. It looks like this place was considered upscale a few decades back - but I've stayed in remodeled MGM resorts in Vegas for $100 a night. The only thing that helped my disappointment was that I got a good laugh at the room when I first walked in.",

Server Michelle T. Was careless, rude  and did not care about us or anything we needed during the meal. \n\nOrdered two simple drinks (a cider and a cocktail) waited 15 minutes for them to bring the cocktail to my boyfriend and then am informed that they don't have the cider I ordered. Suggested a new one and asked for a sample. The gentlemen (maybe the manager?) brought it over and said it is suppose to be super dry. It was so dry I think I could of choked. It was so bad and then told him it was horrid. He suggested the Kurant bees and said it was sweet with hints of honey. Got that and it was worst then the sample and read the can label and it says it's suppose to be a super dry beer. Spit it out and then our server said nothing can be done, and then proceeds to fill my drink and overflows it. \n\nOur food was just okay. I ordered the shrimp Mac and cheese which came with only 4 pieces of shrimp which for $25 is horrible. He ordered chicken which was okay, but he said it was dry and took most of it home because he needed to add ketchup to it. That was $24. Told our sever we wanted to see a manager and she told us they can't be bothered they are too busy and too understaffed. Our bill was $77 and I literally wanted to cry over how much the bill was. I've had bad experiences at restaurants before but this one topped the cake. I don't see myself coming back because it was so bad, and that's coming from me who believes in giving everything a second chance. \n\n Being someone that's in the restaurant industry I can honestly say that's never how you treat your customers. You always treat them with respect and they are always right.",

We ordered 4 ribeyes and got 3 and a tomahawk, so my husband had to sit without his food while everyone else ate.

  "text": "Went to Rothman KOP for the first time, after severe exacerbation of longstanding and complex back problems.  Almost immediately, before my visit started,  an x-ray tech told me she wanted to take x-rays, even lthough I told her I brought a new MRI and x-rays from a few years ago.  She proceeded to take x-rays of my spine while in my street clothes, meaning the metal zipper on my high waisted pants would obscure part of the view of my spine.  Standard parameters on the American College of Radiology website state \"You will be asked to remove some of your clothes and to wear a gown during the exam. You may also be asked to remove any metal objects or clothing that might interfere with the x-ray images.\" Afterwards, when seen by the Physician's Assistant, the x-rays they took weren't shown to me or discussed. Only the MRI that I brought was briefly shown to me.  I wasn't asked to change into a gown for an \"exam\" either, nor was my spine/back examined in any detail.  I was asked to bend forward and backward, sit and lift my legs and push them against the PA's hand, checking for strength or lack thereof.  A test for lack of feeling in my lower legs was done through my pant leg and knee socks, not against my skin.  After this minimal \"exam\" and after relating my complex history as briefly as possible, the PA said, \"So, do you want surgery?\"  Really?  I'm supposed to be the judge of when surgery is indicated?  Apparently, saying yes to surgery would have been the only way for me to be seen by the Orthopedic Surgeon, who, in my opinion, should be the one giving me an \"expert\" opinion as to whether or not I need surgery.  It's one thing to have a preliminary exam by a PA at a physician's office, and it's another thing to rely ONLY on a PA for an exam and treatment of a very complex issue.  From now on I will only go where I can see a board certified Orthopedic Surgeon for my treatment.",

  "text": "I've never written a review before but I felt compelled to share our experience.  I am very disappointed that we spent so much money on such a bad experience.  We won't be coming here again.  We went to The Melting Pot for my very dear friends birthday.  We were not allowed to sit down until our entire party got there and the hostess basically told us to go wait outside.  They finally took us to our table and I had requested a flower to be on the table for her birthday but there was no flower.  The table seemed dirty and the skewers looked like someone had been biting on them.  We have never been there before so we were a little confused as to how to order.  Our waitress seemed irritated that she had to answer questions for us about the menu.  She even acted outwardly condescending almost as if she wanted us to think we were ignorant for not knowing how to order.  An expensive place like this should have excellent customer service.  She was rude and didn't act as if she cared if we were there or not for a special occasion.  We only got our drinks refilled once in 2.5 hours.\n\nWe have wanted to go to this place for YEARS and it was completely disappointing.  We had been warned that we will drop some serious cash on the mediocre (at best) food and may leave hungry.  Just that did happen.  We did not even drink any alcohol, our bill was $180 so we spend 220 with tip.  The cheese was runny and not good at all but we ate it because we were so hungry.  Looking back at our night, I would have preferred to have been offered a spoon and a bowl to put my cheese in so it was not so incredibly messy.  More options would have been appreciated.\n\nThe way the tables are set up, we had to awkwardly and rudely had keep reaching over our boyfriends to  get some not so flavorful and stale bread and dry veggies.  \n\nThe salad looked like someone had just threw some lettuce on a plate and squirted some dressing on it.  Not enough salad or dressing to even tell you if it was decent tasting or not.  The salad was so small that I'm not so sure it should have been considered a salad.\n\nCooking out own food?  Hmmm.  Well I had not even thought that could have ever even possibly been the case.  We were so hungry by the time we got our food that we put as much on our skewers as possible so our pot was filled with all our skewers and we had to wait 2 minutes for each piece to cook.  Some of the meat you couldn't get on the skewers so you had use your fingers to get the raw meat on it.  I don't even know what to say about that.  I didn't think we were going to be eating boiled meat.  We thought we were going to have a dining and eating experience, not a cooking experience.\n\nWe ordered the S'mores chocolate fondue but instead got the marshmallow dream fondue.  We were so hungry, irritated, and exhausted by the whole experience that we just went ahead and ate it so we could get out of there.\n\nWe were there for my friends birthday and they did not go out of their way at all to make her feel special at all.  The flower that I was supposed to have paid for would have at least been real nice.  I would not recommend The Melting Pot.  It wasn't in the least bit fancy or very clean, customer service was terrible, food wasn't good.  The website portrays that this restaurant is really fancy.  Maybe the one in Chesterfield is better???",

  "text": "We were driving through Reno and needed a place to stay that was easy to get to. The lady who I made the reservation with over the phone was very nice, however when we arrived we were greeted with a pretty grim experience from start to finish. \nIt was about 9:30pm when I arrived and there was a line winding around the reception desk of people waiting to check in (on a Thursday night). It took about 45 minutes for the two desk attendants to get to us. I was exhausted and cranky, sure, but these people were the slowest reception desk people I have ever seen. Meanwhile, I was reading reviews on here that showed bedbugs and it freaked me the hell out. Bedbugs at hotels are my biggest fear. I asked the desk lady if anybody had complained about bedbugs recently. She snapped at me that SHE hadn't had any complaints, but SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE. uhhhh what?! What does that mean?\nAnyway, we were staying in one of the \"newly remodeled\" rooms which boasted a jetted jacuzzi tub. It was FILTHY. There was old hair and dirt wedged in the jets. Crud lined the knobs and valves. It was gag-worthy and not in the fun drag queen world way. \nI had thought that was the worst until I got to the bed, which was literally loose sheets draped over a dirty mattress pad, and two loose sheets draped over a naked thin duvet. DO THEY WASH IT?! Do they just drape new loose sheets over it? The sheets are so scratchy I die? \nWe tried to go to the gift shop, it was closed. Someone who worked at the casino said she \"thought\" it was 24 hour. Nope. \nThere was a team of paramedics helping a drunk man in front of it, though, so maybe it was good they had the room. \n The cafe, Rosies was the only thing open to get food from. I ordered french toast and then had to leave my husband there alone because it took so long I was starting to lose my mind. I was losing said mind because the light above us kept fading in and out while old diner songs like \"wooly booly\" played and drunk people tried to eat clam chowder absolutely wasted. Kinda felt like I was trapped in some horrible Twilight Zone casino episode. I had to hear about how my husband ate my french toast alone and I felt bad but also isn't that kind of hilarious? \nAnyway if you want a crazy yelp story, try staying here. I didn't get an infection from the tub, but I kept the water scalding just in case and didn't run the jets.",

When I got there I waited for a couple minutes for someone to even recognize I was standing there. I asked for my pizza and the lady said something about the printer being messed up and printed my order twice and it was never made. She said it would take about 5-10min to make another. I waited patiently and just as they were about to put the pizza in they dropped it on the floor so I waited another 15min for my new pizza. When I got it, the pizza was missing toppings and didn't have what I asked. So I waited about 30mins for the wrong pizza. Not happy.",

  "text": "Miguel's is a cute restaurant with nice decor. They have decent food, but nothing to write home about. The salsa wasn't great - it was kind of bland to me and had an odd taste (they use a particular seasoning that my husband and I couldn't put our fingers on). I ordered their house margarita and I don't know what kind of tequila they use, but it made me so sick!! I felt like I was hungover by the time I finished my drink (I only had one) and was hungover all day the following day. The service was awful. It was a busy Friday night, but they were obviously understaffed. It took about 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink order, then another 20 minutes for him to come take our food order. Our food was delivered by a man who I'm assuming was the manager, and we didn't see our server again until he brought us our bill. I was really hopeful since the place is so cute and in a good location, but needless to say, we will not be back.",

After going there off-and-on for over 10+ years, the fact remains that it just can no longer stand-up to the number of great sandwich shops STL has to offer. \n\nI was in the neighborhood and hadn't been in a good while. My first thought was \"Hmm...But remember how paper-thin their meat slices are?\" But thought I'd give them a go for old time's sake. \n\nI regretted it. \n\nFlavor, etc. and all was fine on my Mom's Special, but the sandwich is about 8% meat, and the rest bread and Thousand Island sauce. It's just not worth the money at all. I was still rather hungry when I finished it. I think Mom's is surviving on neighborhood nostalgia, luckily for them. But it is not a destination spot for sandwiches this town. They truly need to adapt and step-up to the competition (See: Blues City Deli, Adriana's, Nora's, etc.).",

  "text": "I really wanted to like this place because Thursday is half price seafood and bubbly night, and that just sounds like it's made for me. Unfortunately, this isn't the place for me. (EDITED: I moved my review of the food itself to the bottom because I think this next paragraph is important enough to talk about before I get into the food). \n\nWhy the 1 star? We noticed that there were a lot of staff walking around. Mostly guys in suits holding drinks and talking to each other while hostesses and servers worked, cleaned tables, etc. You can tell they weren't customers though, because they had badges and they were walking through the back by the kitchen, etc. As we were leaving, a group of them were seated next to a table being cleaned by a female staff member. The guys were very loudly talking about another female staff member in a crude manner (her sexuality, STD's, etc.) It was disgusting and clearly the girl cleaning the table was uncomfortable. Hell, we were walking by on our way out and were extremely uncomfortable. It was rude, disrespectful, and completely inappropriate. I would never come back to a place that condones that behaviour from its staff, let alone its management.\n\n\nAnd now, the actual review:\n\nWalking up the stairs to the restaurant, you can start to hear the really loud music. For a place that is going for a romantic vibe, it feels like you're walking into a dance club. The hostess couldn't hear us, we couldn't hear her, and then another hostess came out and tried to also seat us because she couldn't hear her co-worker tell her she was looking after us. I think that's a good sign that your music is too loud.\n\nWe were seated in the back half of the restaurant, facing the kitchen window. It really is a beautiful space with big rounded booths, chandeliers and dim lighting. Our hostess dropped an iPad with the drink menu on our table and left. \n\nOur server came out and again, we couldn't hear him. He offered to ask them to turn down the music for the back half of the restaurant and we were much better after that. So, the Thursday special is half price on any sparkling wine and anything on the menu with seafood in it. We ordered a $20 bottle of Spanish bubbles, the lobster bisque, calamari and the seafood tower. Our total came to about $100.\n\nEverything came out really quick and the server and kitchen staff were great. Technically, the dishes were all spot on. Flavour wise, ehhh. I liked that the bread came with blue cheese - that's something different you don't see at other places. The bisque was more a tomato puree vs a lobster dish. The scallop on it was seared perfectly. The calamari was perfectly cooked, but so bland. Finally, the seafood tower was ok. I don't think it's worth the full price of $84 - was a bit skimpy on some things. You can go elsewhere in town for a much better tower if you're willing to pay full price.",

  "text": "I had a picture of the girl (K) harassing us who didn't know how to issue a receipt but she complained and yelp took it down. It is not illegal to take pictures of people in public, even at their place of work, I checked with the police when yelp did this before. Kayla messages md with laws and explanations for her rude behaviour but I live with a cop so she's just copying and pasting a lot of stuff. Some more customer service skills would not hurt this girl at all. \nAnyways, I ordered a bustier online for Halloween and paid for it, they said it was at West Edmonton Mall in the changing room for pick up. \nThe girl in the change room handed me the bag with receipt stapled to it and told me I couldn't try it on. I told her that, yes I can try it on and I did. \nWhen it didn't fit, I went to get a different size but as soon as I stepped foot out of the changing room, another girl (k) stopped me and said she needed to scan my purchase, I said 'it's paid for' and I need another size, she still wanted to scan it and I asked her to please let me try another size then we'll deal with the scanning. She kept following me.  \nThe other size fit, so I took the purchased one with receipt and the one that was the size I needed to the cashier. \nThe 'scanning girl' (K) followed, and said she refunded the original purchase and to make a new purchase with the one that fit, which makes sense, except When I asked for a receipt for proof of refund, she said 'it does not exist', she would not provide any proof that the original purchase was refunded. So, after listening to her patronize me for a while, I asked her to write that the item was returned and refunded on the original receipt. I was not rude, and I think it was a fair concern and request on my part. She wrote it while rolling her eyes at me. \nIt's too bad my daughter spends so much money here on this embarrassingly overpriced store, because I have never come across a pleasant salesperson. \nK just let us shop please. Lay back a little.",

  "text": "Tucker's used to be My favorite steakhouse, and the twelfth street location was my favorite Tucker's.  But something went very wrong.  My absolute fav has been the sirloin... spiced right and very tender.  Tonight, I got the 20 oz sirloin and it took a little longer than usual.  My first bite was disappointing.  It was not hot and was very VERY grisly.  I sent it back to get it warmed up.  A few bites on one end was tender as I remember, but pretty much 80% of the remaining piece of meat was riddled with gristle.  I'm taking it home and braising it.  Maybe it'll turn into a half decent pot roast... as a steak, it missed the mark.  \n\nWhat happened to you Tucker's Place?  Now I have to find a different steakhouse.",

  "text": "I would like to start with stating that this is my first ever yelp review and I downloaded the app and created an account to write this. The food is really delicious but the service is the worst I have ever received. The service is extremely slow, ineffective and oblivious. It took over an hour for us to be seated, I understand waiting but when we got upstairs they clearly have a bunch of staff congregating extremely loudly taking up 3 tables (this is a third of their seating). The whole set up of the upstairs is completely inefficient, if they want to be successful and maximize sales remove the pointless seating area and you can add a minimum of 3 tables. I have been a few times as the food is so great but I will never come again although it's super close to home because the service is so poor and simply frustrating.",

These warnings have never appeared before today. Did my due diligence researching the web to save me another trip to their lot and determined there were too many possibilities so I called back the service department & spoke w/ the gal who checked me out this morning and asked if it might be something simple I could fix myself, a loose vacuum hose, bumped sensor etc... if perhaps a suggestion by the serviceman would be possible...Nope. I was told, and this is almost a quote \"Well...since it's a Toyota & we're a Chevrolet Dealer, we would have to have you run to the Toyota dealership to have that looked at...can I help you with anything else?...\"\nThanks for the zero effort, Megan.",

While the plate and cheese was hot, the mushrooms were barely room temp. My wife's salad and daughters shrimp Alfredo were served 10 minutes before the other 2 dishes! I finally received my Stromboli. It looked flat and unimpressive. As soon as I cut into it, the oil covered my plate. I took one small bite and it was bland and extremely greasy. Server offered a new one but I refused and helped my wife finish her anti pasta salad. Mother in law ordered lasagna and she shared with me. It was hot outside but the pasta was cold! Obviously frozen then thawed. Waitress took my tea for a refill and never brought it back. While the server was nice, she said she told the cook that he \"was screwing up her tip.\" She should have told the cook he was screwing up a family dinner. We will never be back. And I will definitely others about our bad experience. This place has gone downhill.",

  "text": "Well I used to think highly of this YMCA. Everyone used to be so nice and friendly. Being new to TN it was refreshing to find people so nice. Then last Tuesday happened. As I was working out, a buddy of mine and his son whom have a family of 7 (all members) for the last 15 yrs, were working out as well. My buddy came over to give me a few technique pointers on my bench press. When not too long after a woman whom was working out looked at my buddy and said \"your lucky your not shot\". He looked around and said \"me\" she said \"you should be shot\" Called him by his last name and then called him a \"crook\". To think in this given day and age with shootings that someone would even say something like that Is appalling to me. I went and complained to Marlene the Manager on duty. She had me point out the woman and immediately came to her defense as an upstanding member prior to even speaking to her. My buddies and I were then treated like we did something wrong. We were asked to go to a back room so the threatening member could leave. Meanwhile we were never threatening in any way. We were then forced to go to a back room for her protection. Weird feeling to be treated like a threat when someone else out of the blue makes such outlandish comments. We felt the need to contact the police and file a report since this lady knew who my buddy was by name without him knowing her. Police arrived then Marlene kicked us all out to deal with it. Even the police. Turns out this was a business dealing where she wasn't satisfied from 15 yrs ago. Well i sure hope this woman doesn't have an agenda to be an active shooter at the Y given she's still bothered by something 15 yrs ago and clearly doesn't understand what our society is dealing with by her comments. Sad!! At the Y of all places. Also handled very poorly by management.",

I have a hold and the door is still broken. Both times my mail was written on \"box not secure\". Hello!! That is why I put a stop on the mail and requested the door to be fixed. I'm going to have to extend the hold as the box is still not fixed as of tonight 4/11/18. I tried fixing it myself by bending it back but now the lock isn't working good so I left it alone. It wasn't until then that I realized how cheap these secured mail boxes are. I really thought they were a heavy metal. Not something I could bend so easily.\nMy other complaint with the mail person is they often leave my outgoing mail in the box. I make sure it is to the back of the box with the postage showing.\nI often get mail for an apt that doesn't exist. I write return to sender, this apt doesn't exist and the mail person doesn't take it half the time. I have to put pink sticky notes on it before they take it. \nI have never had this kind of mail service until I moved to this address.",

  "text": "Terrible experience at this location. Very used to going to the other location on Veterans and having lots of options. We ordered frozen watermelon margaritas that came out on the rocks. We were informed that only strawberry and mango were in the machine. I don't totally understand not being able to add any flavor to a regular frozen margarita. Our server didn't tell us any of this until we received the drinks and were also inviting over that we could not change our drink choice. We were both disappointed with not having the frozen drinks we intended to and on top of that whatever they use for the watermelon flavor is sour for some reason. \n\nWe ordered our food. The queso was the best part but every other aspect was underwhelming. Personally, I ordered a single enchilada and quesadilla, both items looked like I made them at my house (not even slightly restaurant quality), my friends decried beans were an abnormal color. I also ordered a 2 oz guacamole from my server after much conversation about sharing or not sharing at the table - I thought the guacamole I was given was a little large but I didn't think much of it. \nAfter waiting 30 minutes to get our check after our server picked up some of our plates and proceeded to roll silverware, my check was wrong. I asked my server why the 2 oz guacamole was $7 and the appetizer $5? She told me I didn't order that side portion, which is the second instance of her not fully listening to what we ordered. They ended up taking it off. The server came back to the table to ask which card was mine and then still charged the wrong card. Just skip this place and go to the one on vets.",

The pasta is out of a box and I could cook Mueller's boxed pasta and it would taste better. The pistachio lemon caper butter sauce was served cold and when I sent it back I was told this was the way it was supposed to be served.  The lettuce served for the salad was what I throw away. The salad consisted of arugula  and a vinegrette dressing. Wow, not a great start. They asked me if I wanted cheese on my pasta and I said yes, expecting real cheese. They brought out a bottle of dried Parmesan cheese in a shaker bottle. Not fresh grated and they didn't even offer to shake it on our pasta. The roasted potatoes were just potato wedges. We were expecting roasted potatoes. And to top it off both of us got sick when we got home. Again, the worse restaurant we have ever been to. Stay away!",

Wouldn't someone be smart enough not to make crispy fried food a soggy mess before it even gets to the table?  The mac and cheese that was also served with this dinner was only mediocre.  My husband had a burger that he also considered so-so and thought that the side of mayonnaise he asked for was just awful.

  "text": "Worst customer service department ever.   Over the past 4 months I made numerous calls and at least 5 trips to Reedman to resolve 3 issues related to my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which only has 48,000 miles in almost 4 years.  My issues included rust on the hood, a loose steering wheel and a recall.  I also made or received numerous calls from Jeep Chrysler customer service, who also had communication issues with Reedman and indicated their service was so poor that my file would be flagged for higher level review by Jeep \n\nAt one point, Reedman was to take pictures of the rust and submit it to Jeep for approval to repair.   This was to take 3 or 4 days to get approval.  After weekly calls to Reedman, I learned from Jeep customer service after 4 weeks, the claim and pictures were never submitted.  Reedman eventually admitted after weeks of claiming it was in process that the employee who took the pictures no longer worked there and never submitted anything.    I was then required to take off from work again and return to Reedman.   Of course when I showed up the guy who told me when to come back was not in.  The service manager handled the situation personally, but again 3 days turned into 10 days and I had to call myself to get any information \n\nWhen I took the Jeep to be repaired, I was told the hood would be replaced and it would be done in 2 days.  4 days later I got my Jeep back but the rust was repaired not replaced. The answer was, I was one of the 10% of hoods that could be fixed rather than repaired.  At this point, I plan to take the Jeep back one more time as the paint job is awful   Let's hope they get it right this time.      \n\nMy experience with the other issues was equally poor and frustrating but I'm tired of writing and wasted enough of my time.   My next move is to trade the Jeep somewhere else and never buy from Reedman again.   \n\nGood luck if you choose to buy and service your car at Reedman",

Wishing they could serve a better option in toast instead of only white bread though that's the normal way to serve.\n\nThen, ordered Daal Baati, Dabeli, and Vada Paav to go.\n\nThe Baati in Daal Baati was very dry and thick. We had to use a knife to cut it into pieces. It was still thick and hard even after dipping and soaking it in Daal.\n\nBoth Dabeli and Vada Paav were kind of ok but not appealing to taste as per the normal taste other restaurants serve.\n\nThere were many people coming in to eat or placing orders to go. We think it's good food for non-vegetarians as we overheard most people placing non-vegetarian food.\n\nAlso, many people were just coming in the beer store next to it.\nThat part of the store seemed kind of ok but still both the restaurant and store needs some maintenance and upkeep.\n\n\nAt the moment, we won't be going back there for sure unless we feel like trying it after a few months or so.",

I used to travel to Germany with some frequency, so I feel that I'm quite familiar with how German food is served in Germany, and this is not even close. I knew we were in trouble when the Wiener Schnitzel came out immediately after we ordered. As in any good restaurant, a dish such as Schnitzel should be prepared when ordered. What we got had been clearly prepared in advance and was probably sitting under a heat lamp. Tough, dried out, and tasteless. Yuck! Schweinshaxe should be a guilty pleasure: moist if not greasy meat falling off the bone. What we got looked good, but it was not cooked properly (or it just plain sat too long). The meat was dense and dry - how can that even be possible given how fatty that part of the pig is.\n\nThe service was fine, but it was telling that the waitstaff didn't even blink when they took our 1/4 eaten meals away - they must see that a lot.",

I was sat in a pedicure chair although I was getting a manicure, because the salon was packed. When it was finally time to get my nails done, the nail tech looked like he had no idea what he was doing, and he used a coarse file ON THE TOP of my nail. I asked him for square nails and received a variety of shapes, most of which were crooked. Not to mention that I had to hold my arms up the entire time which burned. When I got home my nail immediately broke due to the rough buffing and filing my nail tech did on my nails. I will never go back to this salon.",

I placed an order for a veggie pizza even though I couldn't find a menu anywhere to view (major points lost for that) and they delivered very quickly. It goes downhill from there. The pizza was the saddest, dryest, most underwhelming pizza I've EVER had. There was little to no sauce and and the cheese and toppings resembled pizza that had been left out overnight. Wouldn't recommend and I will NOT eat there again. \n\nOh I almost forgot, the pizza and delivery ran me about $25. So, not worth it.",

We have lived Pei Wei for yrs and have been to them as far west as San Antonio, Tx  and North to DC but, this location tops the list of worst Customer Service!  \nToday, tilted me to speak with a Manager (who didn't seem to really care to acknowledge they were the Manager than they did when I spoke with them).  The last 2 visits we have encountered the same young man as cashier. This time was excruciating.... as he does not know how to at least fake a smile or even care to greet a customer as they walk up to the register to place their order without any Guidance from him.  Today not only did he not greet me but didn't bother to listen to my order and I had to ask him to repeat he order because I knew he was not listening. After reordering my order and paying a \"Togo\" order, I asked where I he preferred I wait he nonchalantly said \"where ever!\"\n\n\nAs I stepped away from the register I observed his interaction with the older lady who was behind me.  This young man could not be bothered with speaking to her but decided it was appropriate to nod his head at her as if her were passing her on the street.  Not only did nod to her once but twice because she had no idea what he was doing!!!\n\n\nEven more mind blowing is that this cashier was training another employee!!! If this is what Pei Wei thinks is appropriate and train their employees like this ..... we will not be giving them our business...  looks like Chipolte or Jimmy Johns may be on the menu since they are all 3 next to each other.",

My boyfriend and I had four different people waiting on us yesterday, continuously having to wave someone down for more water, ketchup, etc. We usually split a salad and burger knowing it's plenty for the two of us. Keep in mind, the salad costs more than the burger. Last night, we even threw in a soup. When we got our bill, they charged us a $4 split charge, since we split the \"entree\" (the burger). I can totally understand charging the fee if we split the burger and ordered nothing else, but that just feels a little greedy.",

Being the cheapest Casino/Hotel on the block, what more are you to expect I suppose? If you book through the right site at the right time and get their SUPER discounted rates (I'm talking like $50/night) it is absolutely worth it. I will not pay over $100/night again to stay in this hotel. We had some frustrating experiences interacting with the employees of the hotel, attempted to order room service and was repeatedly hung up on and put on hold until I gave up. They could use some re-training on cleaning or maybe some extra staff. Just giving the place a nice deep clean would improve the overall experience significantly. \nI would consider this a 2.5 to 3 star hotel, my rating dropped to a 2 due to the frustrating experiences with staff, not accommodations.",

Graham Heating and A/C came out and told me it would be around 600$ to replace the blower motor and they would order it and call me that day or the next. I called them 5 days later to ask what's up. The guy took 30 mins and charged me almost 1000 $ -No part number, no separate labor charge. I asked other A/c companies and looked up prices on the web and felt majorly ripped off, no quotes over 500$ !!. I spoke to the owner to ask how much labor was and for the part number I was being charged for and he said he told me that he bills a flat fee. Which means no part number or cost and no labor charge separated out which is suspicious, it didn't feel right in my gut, especially when I asked for the information he didn't want to give it to me.In speaking with the owner I am so dissatisfied with his unprofessional attitude and bullying that I'm sharing my experience.

She whispered it but right in front of me and obviously not well.

I also understand if it is a busy time of year and you don't want children there on the weekend but just say that. Don't whisper it to the receptionist and force her to lie- Very unprofessional.

  "text": "This Burger King location is so awful I felt compelled to post a review in an attempt to draw attention from their corporate office to do SOMETHING about the management.  I have never encountered such an unprofessional staff who obviously hate working there.... Nothing but bad attitudes when placing an order inside the restaurant and in the drive-thru.  Making a simple request to add or take off anything on your sandwich is completely ignored....And if you point out that they made a mistake, just be ready for an even worse attitude back instead of an apology... God forbid they make an extra effort to read the specifics of the order on the screen...All they do now is throw whatever is sitting out already made in a bag because the loud, obnoxious conversations they are having with the other co-workers is far more important than actual customer service.The last 5 visits I have discovered when I got home, my order was wrong.... (wrong toppings/wrong drink) or something was left out of the bag that I paid for. Of course I try calling to complain and no one answers the phone.....EVER. My last experience in the drive-thru did it for me.... I had one drive-thru worker literally throw my bag of food at me after I looked inside to discover they had given me the wrong order.  It took every ounce of my being not to get out of my car and throw everything right back at her.  On top of the bad attitudes, rude service and wrong orders...be prepared to wait a long period of time to get your old, cold, soggy food. I stop at this location because of the convenience since it is closer to home but I ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to spend my money there ever again. The staff needs to be trained properly or fired.... This place is a disgrace and after skimming through the other reviews online, it looks like 99% of their regular customers are experiencing the exact same thing.  Clean the place up........or shut it down.",

Well, when you bill something as a meal on your menu and you run an establishment like this, the price of a drink is normally included.  $14 for The Real Deal Meal -- a smoked meat sandwich dealie -- and a drink isn't included in the price?  No, thank you very much.\n\nWhen I asked the woman working at the counter what was included with the meal, she told me that coleslaw and a pickle were included, which any half-decent deli should include at no extra charge and without any fanfare.  They charge $3 extra for both at Baba Fink's and they make a big deal about it (you can purchase the sandwich alone, and that is listed on the menu).  When I clarified and confirmed that a drink wasn't included in the price, I walked away.  The woman called out to me, presumably to offer me a complementary or a discounted beverage.  It was too late by then, for I try to avoid doing business with shop or restaurant owners who get a wee bit too greedy for their own good.  I won't be back.",

Part of the order arrived as it should have.  However the biggest part of the order didn't ship till 12/26 and didn't arrive at my home till late in the day, 12/29. \nWhen I contacted West Elm's customer service, was told \"oh, that's not our fault.  UPS must have held up the delivery\".  \nPlease note, there was no special labeling on the box to identify it as an expedited shipment and West Elm didn't have the package ready for delivery till 12/26.  \nAfter a great deal of discussion, West Elm finally agreed to refund the expedited shipping fee....they refunded $6.  I had paid over $30 for expedited shipping.  \nThen, decided to return the order, with the idea of re-ordering and have the re-order sent directly to the gift recipient.  Took the order to the West Elm store in Indianapolis 01/20, and they gladly began the return process, telling me the refund would show up in my account within 24 hrs.  Here it is 02/01 and still no refund.  \nCalled the customer service center yesterday and they told me that the refund was processed for payment 01/29 and I should receive the refund sometime over the next week or two.

  "text": "So I think we all can agree that Olive Garden isn't the place to go for authentic Italian cuisine. It's usually just a matter of convenience if we go here and it's usually mediocre, at best. Yesterday I was craving pasta, and to be honest I do like the salad. We were seated and glanced over the apps and opted for Fried Pasta Chips with marinara. The pic looked amazing, like Italian nachos. The server brought them out quickly and they were hot with sauce and a few peppers on the top. I was excited and put a pasta chip in my mouth,, WHOA!!! SALT!!!! OK so maybe that particular area got hit heavy. Tried another chip. Same. And I don't mind food with a some salt, but this was completely inedible. The hipster server asked how the app was and I explained why we didn't care for it. He understood and agreed. He also said they're made in the morning. MORNING??? It's 6pm!!!! We ate our salad and breadsticks, which oddly seemed very salty as well. Since we bailed on the apps I decided to order a couple of meatballs, on the side. Now, in my experience, a side of meatballs are usually a good size, more than a few bites each, and brought to the table covered in sauce. Well, when the entrees arrived, which were just fine, the two meatballs were placed on the table in dish, bare. Naked. Sans sauce. And small... So small my wife looked at me like this was joke!! I asked the server if we could some sauce on them and he then brought them back with sauce. You could barely tell it was sauce. Mearballs should come swimming in sauce, enough for them to be at least a third covered. Come on!! That told me that they really don't care what they serve. Like they were saying 'f you, here's your sauce.' I will gladly give up going here and will gladly go out of my way to one of the many great local Italian restaurants that do know how to serve great food with heart, and passion. F you OG. We're done.",

My server was friendly and attentive. I received my order in a timely manner although the restaurant was full and the to go side pumping out meals. Great job! 5 Stars for that! But hold on....The lollipop lamb chops were grilled to perfection however like the Mac and cheese very salty. I got an instant headache! I took some home for another opinion. I just said, 'here are my leftovers' no further comment. Later I was told 'the food was good but too salty'. The cabbage was not salty, all the food was good but proceed with caution. Make sure you are up to date on your high blood pressure medicine!\n\n**ORIGINAL REVIEW***This restaurants grand opening was listed for over a week ago and shown on FYI 6 ABC. I looked on the website to find the hours and location in West Philadelphia and they appear to be open. I arrived at the restaurant approximately 2:30 in the afternoon on Sunday, April 21, 2018 to only find the restaurant was not open for business. Not only was the new space closed so was the old or original space. The hours show they're supposed to be open every day up until at least 10 PM. Maybe it was just free advertisement on the Nto get people to come out. The windows had brown paper on the windows so you cannot see through them.\n\nI will try again at a later date to see if they are open but, if this is how business will be conducted I can't imagine me coming back. No sign on the door, no voicemail, no notification whatsoever regarding the status of restaurant.",

  "text": "They claim \"over 55 taps.\" This is kind of true. I sat at the bar and did, indeed, count 55 taps. They had 45 of those taps actually going. Not a big deal but I've been here twice and counted the same last time as well. Yes, I know, I'm a total psycho that I count the taps. I should note that it's been 6 months since I've been here. That being said, the food menu is the exact same or at least virtually identical as 6 months ago. Very limited. The service is very very very slow at the bar. Each of my 2 visits I had to ask where my food was. Hummus took nearly 25 minutes to make its way out and it was very average and only served with pita chips...no option for raw veggies. Then it was another 25 minutes before I got the salad (which anyone with spinach, craisins, walnuts, blue cheese, and generic Italian dressing could make just as well). This time I ended up asking for my entree to go as I passed the hour mark without dinner. Both times I noticed the more alternative your appearance or bushier the beard (as long as you have slicked, perfectly coiffed hair to perfectly mismatch your out of control bushy beard to suggest the dichotomy of...some stupid point you're trying to make, while wearing black rimmed glasses whether or not you actually need glasses) the better service you received. Neither good nor bad; just the demographic they look to resonate with. If that describes you you'll love it. However, coming in town on business and with at least 5 hotels in walking distance, this place doesn't even pretend to try to cater to the business crowd. I'd recommend going somewhere else.",

Finally, I get to taste the real thing. \n\nThe place looks welcoming with two separate doors leading to seating area, counter and their wall of franchise facts and photos. On the other wall is a great assortment of t-shirts, some of which are quite clever. I arrived around noon and I expected a lineup but instead found a disorganized crowd. Everyone in there had already ordered but they were all waiting for their food. For the number of people behind the counter and in the kitchen, I was surprised by the delay. \n\nThey have four sizes of donair (regular, medium, large and supreme) but I noticed only two sizes of pita: small and large. I placed my order for a medium, no cheese, standard toppings. I moved away and found a spot to stand with the rest. \n\nI was lucky enough to get my order before many of the others waiting. There was some confusion if the order was mine as they call out numbers when ready but they didn't give me one nor did I get a receipt. Once I sat down and I opened the bag, I was pretty excited. Within I found an aluminium foil bundle which, when opened, let out a cloud of steam. On first glance, it looked like... a hot mess. Meat, onion and tomato covered in sauce. Because of only two pita sizes, the medium is a lot of toppings on a teeny, tiny pita. I didn't even see it at first. I tried picking it up but unlike western donairs that are served in a paper wrap or plastic bag, the aluminium foil barely held it together. It completely fell apart. Most of my bites had no pita but only toppings. Worst of all, the taste was only average at best. Average meat, average tomatoes, average onions, average sauce. Pita - below average. \n\nI was hoping to experience THE donair from the makers of the original, the King of Donair.\nIf this is the real thing, however, I'll stick with my western Canadian imitation instead.",

  "text": "My mom and I showed up for 2 pedicures and I also wanted my nails painted with gel polish. I showed the guy at the front desk a picture of the gel polish nails and he said it was doable. I asked how long the wait was for the pedicures, he responded with follow me and I'll have you seated. The water we put our feet in was as cold as can be. Not even lukewarm, COLD. I happened to look over and there were 5 other people waiting to get pedicures who had been waiting before we arrived. We waited almost an hour before anyone came over to get started on our pedicures. Needless to say I was upset that we were sitting with out feet in cold water that long. As the 2 ladies started on our pedicures I noticed the lady who was doing my toes did not seem experienced at all which I'm fine with me but she had to redo my French tip several times. I asked for a flower and got 5 dots, I then had to ask her for additional detail because I wasn't happy with her \"flower\". It still came out horrible but I was so irritated at this point that I was over it. The same lady who did my toes said she would be doing my gel polish. I showed her the picture I wanted and she says she'll \"try\" to do it. I picked out a color that looked like a soft pink color. As she began to paint my nails I noticed it was practically clear. When I asked her she said she'll do a few more coats and it'll turn to pink. After the second coat I noticed it was still clear and at this point I had enough. I asked her to just add the glitter so we can finish and I can be on my way. We proceed to wait in line to pay. The guy up front says the total is $100 for both pedis and my gel polish. I said how is it that much when both pedis were $35 each thinking there's no way I'm being charged $30 for this horrible gel polish on my nails. He asks the lady who did my nails to come over and she explains the \"design\" on my nails was what made the price go up. I said the glitter you put over a clear coat? You can't be serious? At this point I was fuming and had enough of this horrible nail salon. We paid and my mother was nice enough to leave them a tip even though the service was TERRIBLE. Here we are a week later and my French tip is already chipping off. This place is horrible. I will never step foot in their place of business again. Spend your money else where is my advice.",

Although, I am booked to cruise next year for the first time with Royal Caribbean, I'm quite nervous given the experience I have had with them thus far.  \n\nI contacted Royal Caribbean (RC) to book as part of a group.  The group was set up by a family member.  I was given the group number and name of the agent they worked with along with pricing for the specific rooms that were blocked as part of the group.  I contacted RC and asked to speak to said agent but was told any agent could help me.  I was then given different prices for the 'group rooms'.  Unsatisfied, I decided to call back.  I contacted RC a total of 6 times over the next two days to get pricing on different types of rooms for the cruise in question.  Every time, I had to speak to someone new and start over.  When I finally had what I wanted I asked them to hold the rooms for 24 hours while I confirmed with my family to ensure they were happy with the rooms and pricing.  I was told they could not hold the rooms without a deposit.  This is crazy since my travel agent could do this for me.  In addition, my travel agent could get the same EXACT rooms but cheaper than what RC was quoting me!\n\nWhen I asked RC why I was not given the same pricing that was given to the group - I was told that when the group made the group booking, they had received a promotional rate that was no longer available.  They would not honor this even though when this booking was made it was made for the group - but because our deposit was not given on the same day... we were out of luck.  \n\nI wrote a letter to RC to explain all of the issues we had when trying to book our reservations, our dissatisfaction with the 'group' process and their reservations line.  They wrote back addressing my concerns and apologizing.  They did not offer to match the rate my family had received.  They did not offer me a single concession.\n\nI've always heard Royal Caribbean was a great cruise line but honestly, I've yet to see it and I am a year out from actually cruising with them!   \n\nIf I were not invested in this particular cruise (due to a previously planned family milestone celebration), I would not give RC a dime of my money.",

  "text": "I went to the deck at the Moshulu for the first time this weekend with a few friends this weekend. I wanted to love this place since it is a 5-minute walk from my house but sadly I didn't. The view and décor are great, and I love the Mushulu but the deck was a major flop. We sat down at a bar seat and asked a waitress if we could order drinks and a few apps and she went to get us menus. She came back a few minutes later and told us they were no longer serving food on that deck and we would have to sit on the other side. We went to the hostess on the other side of the deck and asked for a table for 4 and she told us it would be one minute. After about 10 more minutes we checked back in with her to see how long it would be to decide if we should get a drink at the bar while we waited, and she again told us one minute. Another hostess then went to seat another table that walked in after us, so we checked in with her about our table and she told us that we weren't on the list. There were about ten open tables, so we were very confused about the wait. Finally, the second hostess came back and walked us to our table but after a few minutes we found out we couldn't order appetizers in this section and that we would need to find a table in the top section. We had asked if we could sit in the top section when we first walked in and were told no so we were all confused. Basically, every single person working at the restaurant except for our waitress seemed like they didn't have a clue. Our drinks and our food were great but not worth the hassle we had to deal with to get a table.",

No ice machine on the third floor, the staff do not know how to connect guests to the WiFi network and when there is a problem with the room after calling twice hotel staff never fixed the problem. As an event attendee free coffee was offered but free water was not u til halfway through the night. Myself and other patrons had to purchase water from the bar. Furthermore the next day the banquet team did not set up enough tables for dinner eventhough there was a seating chart provided to the banquet team. The food service was slow. Only a total of 6 servers were present and servicing tables for a room of 240+ people. Our timeline of event had to be altered because of the slow service. After all this nearly half of the event patrons food was not only cold or barely warm upon being served it was also inconsistent in terms of some food was cooked and some was just plain burned or dehydrated.",

  "text": "We usually stay at Holiday Inn Express and once in a while do the Holiday Inn, although it seems to be to remind us to stay at the Express instead.\n\nCheck in was decent enough, nothing great, but not rude or anything.  She kind of whipped through everything like she was running through a script.  I get it, you repeat the same thing multiple times a day, but since it's the first time you're telling me, you should probably slow down a little and at least pretend that you are speaking with me and not just blurting out your lines.\n\nThe hotel itself was decent looking but the elevators are so small!  Our family of 3.5 could barely fit in there together and we actually had to take two elevators to get us up there along with our luggage.  The dollies were tiny too, like half size, but I suppose they have to be to fit in the elevators.  Our cooler had to sit on it sideways, but then it didn't fit through the elevator doors, so we had to take it off the dolly and drag it in.\n\nThe room looks like it was recently remodeled so it has that retrofitted look to it, when you take an old room and replace the fixtures and such with new things so it looks old but new.  Kind of like putting all new stainless steel appliances in your 1920s kitchen.\n\nI like the flooring, no carpet, it's this faux wood tile stuff.  It was clean, I wore white socks and they stayed pretty clean, and my kids ran around barefooted and their feet stayed clean too as long as they stayed out of the corners and away from the edges.  It seems like they come in and damp dust/mop the floors and push everything to the edges and leave it there.  The baseboards were dusty and hairy and the edges of the room were dirty with hair, big piles of dust and a bonus tree nut. \n\nAlso whatever they use to clean the floor, I'm guessing it's some kind of cleaner system like Swiffer or Bona, leaves a sticky feeling residue so the floor feels kind of icky, like it's not clean, even if it is.\n\nThe sheets were clean, although we discovered when we were leaving that the mattress cover/pad was stained.  There were a lot of hairs in the bedding and towels, which I know get stuck in there during the wash process, so they were like kind of stuck in the weave, not just sitting on top.  I realize this happens however, when they're making up the beds, they should be looking out for such things and pulling them out.\n\nThe bed itself was standard IHG, soft, with the different pillows.  No complaints there.\n\nThe refrigerator was tiny, one of those little cube ones, we had to take the shelves to fit our milk gallon and then there wasn't really room for anything else.  No microwave, although there was one available in the lobby.\n\nTub was old and dingy looking and had not been rinsed out.  Shower curtain was missing its inner liner and appeared to have been that way for a while because there was a good bit of mildew growing on the cloth outer curtain.\n\nThe toilet paper holder was mounted on the side of the vanity in such a way that you had to reach a little behind yourself to get to it.  Our roll was almost empty upon arrival and there were not reloads in the room.  The bathroom itself was very small, the door hit your knees when sitting on the toilet.  There's no exhaust fan in the bathroom so it got very steamy when the shower was on.  The water was temperature locked or something because it did not get hot past a certain point, no matter how much you turned it to hot.  It was warm enough to be comfortable but I have thick skin and it takes a lot to warm this cold heart.\n\nNo free breakfast served here, but that's standard for HI.  Indoor pool and hot tub plus outdoor pool; we did not use either.  There's a restaurant there, but from the room service menu, it seemed overpriced.  There is a steak n shake next door though, if you're into that.\n\n\nWe would not stay here again.  There are lots of HI and HIE around the STL area to choose from, so we'd try a different one.  Although we will be sticking to the HIE until I have time to forget and stay at a HI again.",

  "text": "I never write online reviews but I've made an exception due to the fact that Beach City is a corrupt and obscene place for anyone trying to get a collegiate education. First I will address the noise. It is abnormal for even the biggest party schools with neighbors speakers rocking my walls until 2 am on a regular basis. If you don't mind incredible sound and a sleep schedule that involves waking up at 10 to get 8 hours of sleep then to each their own. Now I would like to address the state of the apartments. They have a massive bug infestation that they fail to address and you will most likely have bugs in your bed, crawling on your phone screen if your looking at it in bed. On top of that my apartment came with multiple areas of water damage and rusted out hinges/ shower poles that would make you desire a tetanus shot after touching them, some of the water damage many months old showing black mold. My roommate told me that one of the water damage areas occurred 6 months ago, meaning that they will deduct the cost of fixing it and not do the repairs. That being said that is just the beginning. The \"Security\" is nothing more than a bunch of punk kids who live their and get a reduced rent for attempting to rein in parties that resulted in multiple injuries and a mattress being thrown into a crowd of people, risking life. The real security doesn't do anything and it's a private company. The management team, short of Sheri who is the executive director, is nothing more than a bunch of crooks. When I got a lawyer to remove myself from the community he told me that St. George has a reputation amongst the entire legal community as being the worst among the worst. Just look at other student housing and try to find 32 one star reviews anywhere else on yelp. Let's also not forget the amount of blow dealers and stuff going on, which happens everywhere but not with such open solicitation for complete strangers. If anybody needs a lawyer I personally had a great experience with Mike Brelje, but don't expect to get out of your lease easily or cheaply, and without some boarder line illegal intimidation So here's a few tips for the folks that are stuck their waiting for repairs. For starters if they don't fix something in 14 days properly you have the right to hire someone of your own choosing and they have to pay it. Another thing is that they have a whole bunch of code violations (I.E broken glass on the fire extinguishers, improperly built carports, and a whole bunch of little stuff that st George will have  pay and if you consistently report it to the city they will get fined and that's how I was able to get them to let me out easier than expected. Just contact a lawyer because they will charge you full rent and lie about putting you on a waiting list. However I will say the location is killer and most of the people are genuinely nice. But at the same time you could be walking and get struck with a water balloon while your using expensive earphones or holding school work (happened to me). And on top of all of that I had an asthma attack and my doctor required me to put in an air conditioner unit and the management threatened to evict me for it even though I would not be able to breath without it. If your not going to school and want to party and you don't mind being in a shitty apartment this is the place. Don't be fooled by the nice location and the outside because the appliances, plumbing, management, and general atmosphere could not be further from the aesthetics that indicate class and quality. Also if you own a bike and don't keep it inside it will be vandalized, guaranteed. Oh and I forgot I know at least four apartments, mine included, with broken heaters.",

Cost us $500. In less than a year, my service engine light came back on with the same code. We took it to this one and told them how we had this fixed a year ago and it is telling us it already needs to be replaced again. We paid them $120 thinking they replaced the thermostat. 4 days later the service engine light came back on with the same code. Took it back and after waiting another 2 hours just for them to look at at it (2 hours wait on each visit just for diagnosis), they told us they needed to replace the thermostat for $250. We told them they just replaced it last week and they said all they replaced was the sensor. I have never in my life screamed at a professional and always wondered how people could do that. Well, for the first time in my life, I found the place who could bring that out of me. We left and will find somewhere else to fix it. They are not getting another dime or time from me!",

  "text": "OK, I hate to write bad reviews but I have to make an exception.  I'm not familiar with Scratch Magoo's but they had a write up about delicious tacos, one of the five best in the city.  It must have been a very old review because they were the worst tacos I've ever had.  Now realize it was $2.50 taco night but there is no excuse for what got served.\nFor $2.50 you get two choices: beef or chicken, I chose beef.  The tacos came and they were below the level of what my mother gave me when I was 10 years old.  They were so small, I had to open up the flour taco to make sure there was something inside at all.  It turned out the meager filling was a little ground beef that I don't think was even seasoned, a little lettuce, and some sour cream.  That was it.  Seriously, $2.50 isn't much but save your money I get a kit from Acme you'll be better off.\n\nThe dining room is really dark which makes it romantic but you can't see your food.  The dining room wasn't very busy on a Tuesday evening which made it a little lonely for the three of us.\n\nI root for every restaurant to succeed and I hope Magoo's succeeds but they need to at least try a little.  I'd go back for to try something else but they haven't given me any reason with all the options in the area.",

  "text": "I'm disappointed with this place. I tried it a few years ago and it was actually probably 3 stars then.  I've just recently started going about once a week since I work close. After my most recent experience I will never go back. The food isn't good enough to be worth their expensive prices. Extremely oily too. The last few times I have gone the service has been horrible slow. They leave you standing at the door for days (I only have an hour lunch) by the time you sit and they actually bring your food you have to turn around and get back to work. Once they drop your food off you'll be lucky if they even come back to your table. This past Friday was the worst. A friend and I had to wait 10 mins even to order to go. Then it took about 20 to 30 mins to get our food. One salad with chicken and one Moo Dang soup with steamed pork wontons.  We leave and get back to work and find out that they forgot the dressing for the salad and the steamed pork wontons. We had to go back. They apologized and blamed the kitchen. They gave us a couple egg rolls and spring rolls free, for our troubles. That was nice. So they gave me my steam wontons and I went back to work. When I finally was about to set my soup up my lunch was over. The soup itself was good until I ate a wonton. It was overwhelmingly doughy. I spit it out of my mouth and it was RAW. I unfortunately ate half of it. I dug out the other wontons and they were all raw.  Are you kidding me? I called the place and told the server they where raw. She apologized and blamed the kitchen once again. Didn't offer my money back or anything. Just \"I'm sorry the kitchen did it\" WOW this place lost my business and the other girls I work with who were coming here as well. Horrendous. I much rather eat at a real Thai food place that care about their customers and who doesn't serve raw food. Also the place is disgusting dirty. On their ceiling fans are tons of spiderwebs covered with dust. Which are right above the tables so the dirt falls into your food. Gross.",

  "text": "Be very careful if you chose to use this mechanic. They will charge you double markup on parts. (Proof below.) This is unethical. We are from out of town. Our car broke down and we had to have it fixed immediately. Google had relatively good reviews of this mechanic. However, the tow truck driver did not recommend them. Now I know why.\n\nOur bill for repair was way too high. In full disclosure, they did call ahead with the price estimate and I approved. That's my fault. But after receiving the bill, they would not provide an itemized bill, to hide the fact they intentionally overcharged. I noticed the part was quoted $688! This was way too high. \n\nAfter research, the Napa part they used only cost retail $344. Guess what $344 times two is? You guessed it: $688. I caught them doubling the price on me. Not only would they not fix it, they would not accept that they knowingly charged too much. \n\nPlease do not use this mechanic unless you have written quotes and double check everything they say. All documentation is below. You can see what they charged me as well as retail pricing for the actual part, to do the math yourself.\n\nProof with receipt and Napa pricing: https://imgur.com/a/cmT0qMF",

  "text": "As much as I love the food at Pats, I can no longer continue to come here during normal business hours. Let me preface by saying, the food is exceptional. From pizza to cheesesteaks, anything you get is mind blowingly stellar. However, my issue is with how busy they are and how it affects service.\nMy job is a mile down the road and I usually order delivery. It takes no less than 45 minutes to arrive. So long! The other day, I decided to sit-in for lunch thinking it would be quicker. I was sadly mistaken! I came at 12 o'clock (typical lunch break time) and waited 35 minutes to get my food! What did I order you might wonder? A cheesesteak! That's it! I don't understand what took so long because when I came in, they're only three patrons seated in the whole restaurant. The phones were not ringing off the hook, either. When my food finally came I had to take it to go-to because so much time had passed. While I waited, the servers gave a half-hearted apology.. as though it was the norm. When I went to leave, there was a line almost to the door of people waiting to order.\nFor my cheesesteak and fountain soda I paid just under $16. Not worth it, too expensive and too long of a wait, I'll go elsewhere. \nAlso, one time when I got delivery to my job, the delivery driver asked me, \"why do you eat this junk?\" Not cool. If you don't love your job, quit.",

  "text": "I was excited about going to LUVi, but disappointed in the whole experience. The atmosphere is cute and cozy, but upon being seated, things started to go downhill. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of sake, and it took more than 20 minutes for our server to fetch it from the fridge. My boyfriend and I both ordered the \"Feed Me\" omikase, and we're excited about balling out with some creative sashimi. (They're are 2 \"Feed Me\" options - $45 per person for raw and cooked food, $60 per person for just raw. We got just raw.)\n\nThis consisted of 5 teeny tiny dishes of raw fish. 2 salmon, 2 tuna, and one snapper. They were sooo small, and there was nothing special about them - just topped with some ponzu and mango purée. They had obviously made an effort with the presentation - there were tiny flowers cut out of mango slices and one tuna dish had the fish arranged like a rose, but these decorations weren't enough to distract from the rather boring taste. \n\nWhen our waiter came over to ask if we needed anything else I was so surprised I literally said \"wait, there's no more food coming??\" I did not feel 'fed' at all. Please at least throw in some rice or something!!\n\nMy boyfriend and I were very disappointed that a dinner that cost over $200 left us feeling completely unsatisfied. We went straight to Company Burger and each devoured burgers and tater tots. \n\nWho knows, maybe ordering the \"Feed Me\" was a mistake and ordering off the menu is better, but that makes me sad because typically omikase is a chefs opportunity to impress guests and really blow them out of the water. \n\nMy tips to LUVI? Cut the price in half for the \"Feed Me\" or kick it up a notch with some more creativity and carbs.",

The barriers to gain entrance are large. There is a step up from the front sidewalk and no signage indicating an accessible entrance.

To start with, there was no good food options. Yes, at a \"buffet.\" There were rices and sides but no good options if you eat meat.  They had Tandoori chicken...but...the first piece I got was colorful outside and completely raw inside (rare if we would be talking about a steak). The second piece I tried was blah, no flavor. Another meat option was a butter chicken but was also dry and with lack of flavor. They kept filling up the trays with veggies and rices but no real options to taste. I was there waiting for about 45 minutes but the meat dishes never came out.   I have eaten several times at Indian restaurants for both buffet and ordering from regular menu with fantastic options. How does Haveli ought to call this a lunch buffet when there's no food?! Unbelievable. It was probably 12:30pm when I was there so it was a good time to get lunch, no excuses to not have food.

  "text": "I'm only here to suggest avoiding brunch at all costs. I'm sure their dinner is worth it but that's not what I came for and unfortunately I doubt I'll be back. \n\nFor starters, I was starving when I got here. I was lured in by the huge brunch sign and I went in and ordered a Frozé as my drink choice and it was bitter and gross. I understand wine is dry but once you turn it into a cocktail it should have a bit more flare to it and it just tasted like cold wine. \n\n\nThe best food I had was the baked bread and olive oil appetizer. Everything else was just bad and it took forever to come out even though there was barely a soul in there. \n\nI ordered the biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were thick and hard as rocks. Hard, dense, crumbly and not appetizing. For what it's worth, the fried egg was cooked to perfection and the sausage gravy was flavored well but the dish as a whole was a fail. They asked me how I liked it and I begrudgingly said no because I don't like sending food back but I was so hungry. \n\nI ended up ordering French toast with berry compote. I need to mention that me and my friend ordered this to share initially and the waiter just completely forgot to put it in. So here I am ordering it a second time only for it to come out gross. It was little soggy pieces of wet sponge bread and a bitter berry sauce on top. I was so disappointed that they brought me yet another bad meal and I'm sure you could see it on my face because the waiter came over and assumed as much without me complaining. \n\nThe one thing that allows me to give this place two stars is the fact that the manager and waiter seemed to be genuinely concerned that I hated my food and kept asking if I wanted something else. They took both meals off of my bill even though I didn't ask them to. I appreciated that they at least they provided quality customer service where their food was lacking.\n\nAll in all, don't come here for brunch. The waiter even said he hadn't tried the brunch food and I see why.",

About 1 1/2 years ago they started a Master Swim program that locked out the regulars 4 mornings a week. They also do not enforce the \"no children\" rule when the pool is open to members. \nTop that off with their extremely high dues and the place is no longer for me.",

I went in for what I suspected was a bacterial infection in my intestinal track (I have a history of IBS and Gastro. Problems) I was willing to do whatever tests needed to figure out my issue and a course of action. I heard my doctor mocking my symptoms with the nurses outside my door. Belittling my discomfort because she couldn't 'see' my issue. (Diarrhea for 5+ days with no relief and blood in my stool) She remarked that she hadnt seen me go to the bathroom once since I'd been there, so I must be fine. Because in our 2 minute interaction I didnt poop on her table. In reality, I had gone two times while waiting for her to get to my room. And again when I was in my room after talking to her. I'm hoping the antibiotic she prescribed helped me but I'm confused as to why a doctor wouldn't even try to diagnose you before rushing you out of the office...I didnt feel like this doctor cared at all about my pain and only about getting me out as fast as possible so she didn't have to help me. My doctors name was Dr. Katie Shine. I'm very disappointed in my experience here and have had more helpful experiences sitting 3+ hours in an E.R. it would be worth the wait if the doctor cared about helping you.",

I was told my last bill would be prorated, to reflect the 2 weeks that went unused in my billing cycle (I have this in writing). I ended up being billed the FULL amount and told that being billed in full was their fault and I would receive a refund within 60 to 90 days. No big deal... THEN I'm charged again in FULL for 2 more additional months, luckily, I removed auto pay so the amount wasn't drafted out. However, I was told I was going to be sent to collections due to failure to pay. I had to call and an hour later the additional amount was taken care of, I was told this was a \"system error\", no apologies. I then asked about my refund. I was told that per their contracts that they do not offer refunds, and that I have been told the wrong information (several times), because of \"bad communication within the company\". I asked to speak with a manager who told me the same thing, I told him I had it in writing (via the online chat) and spoke to different managers who \"noted\" my refund in my account. Again, he said there was nothing he can do and it's their policy, he couldn't explain to me why I had been told I would get a refund.

If we weren't going to be late to an appointment, I would have gone in again.....it's pretty much ridiculous.",

He was pleasant to them but barely acknowledged me. The food was greasy, the biscuits were hard. It also lacked taste. Not the usual food I get there. I do not know if Tim is his real name but he is very tall and Caucasian and slim built. I spoke to the manger who did comp my meals for me because I didn't eat it and was apologetic !",

  "text": "I've been going to this restaurant for several years now for breakfast.  This past Sunday though, I was highly disappointed to see a customer with her dog inside roaming around.  It was clearly not a service dog, just some older lady that wanted to bring her dog with her.  This is extremely unsanitary.  Diseases can be passed directly and indirectly from animals to humans.  There are also vector born diseases which are passed from the dogs parasites to humans.  As an example, ticks carry several different types of diseases.  When someone brings their pet into any establishment, but especially food, we are at the mercy of their habits such as picking up their dog's feces in their yard or letting them roam amongst it for days picking up parasites.  We are at the mercy of them keep their dog free of parasites/worms/fleas/ticks, etc.  We can only hope that their yard is free of fleas, ticks, etc., and the yard of wherever else their dog has been roaming.  We also hope that they take their dog to the vet regularly to be tested for parasites, and receive proper medication when needed.  But we all know, that in fact, is not the case with every dog owner.  We all know that people here let their dogs go to the bathroom anywhere, and then do not pick it up.  Dog excrement is loaded with parasites.  Then other dogs are roaming amongst it, and the Parasites are attaching themselves to the animals, which are now coming into the restaurant and attaching themselves to carpet and anything else in the restaurant.  One worm.....can lay 100,000 eggs per day, yes, per day.  These eggs come out in the dog's feces, and remain active in the environment infecting both animals, and humans.  In addition to impacting our health via parasites and diseases, it is highly insensitive to people that have allergies.  I had a neighbor, whose throat would immediately close up, and he required emergency EMT to assist, despite the owners claiming their dog was hypo-allergenic and shed free.  You just never know, nor can you predict, a person's sensitivity.  It is also insensitive to people whom have had negative experiences with dogs.  Dog attacks is one example.  In addition, we don't all own a dog, so please don't shove yours down our throat.  If you want to have breakfast with you doggo....eat at home.  My family and I will not be back to Lenny's due to their gross negligence for the safety of their patrons, and employees.  Bad form, Lenny's.\nhttp://www.petsandparasites.org (1 of several resources on this subject)",

He never ever ever ever gives the manager here a day off. The GM (Pancho) never even works his entire shift. And threatened all of us to take our jobs away if we did not come in for a shift we could not attend. Everything bad that happens if anything is because this guy ( Pancho ) does not try. He does not have respect for his employees. He overworks them. Especially the manager I had which im sure still works there ( Jose ) I used to come here alot, so I worked here then quit a few weeks after because of how (Pancho) treats the employees. It's disgusting. The manager works 7 days a week! The Gm or whatever he is does not give him a day off. Supposably the excuse would always be \"nobody could cover him\" or \"come in or you'll lose your job\" MAYBE EVEN IF HE HAD A FUNERAL TO ATTEND, the GM would say \"No! Come in or I'll fire you\" (All former employees under their business have experienced this from him) even probably when he is on his death bed, he still can't get a day off. He gave me very little hours. They do need a new GM or whatever (Pancho) is. Because they will keep on loosing employees because of how he manages the business. Alot of people barely lasted 2 weeks with pancho. PLEASE TREAT YOUR EMPLOYEES RIGHT! Yes the food is decent, although PANCHO isnt all that clean with the products &&' it's disgusting what they do to the manager and the employees here!",

  "text": "I was looking for a new(er) car bc my Solara with 1/4 million miles blew up. Started to speak with Jocelyn(may be spelled wrong) about a certified 2018 Subaru Legacy. Not exactly the car I want but need an AWD basic transportation. The price listed wasn't what I willing to pay. Explained I would be coming with cash(check). We spoke back and forth a couple times(email) and the last email we came within $500 of what I wanted to pay(in their favor). Went to see the car on a Saturday afternoon(1.5 hrs from me). When we got there, I spoke with Rod and told him of who I spoke with and what was agreed upon. He got another employee, Bill(very nice). He was aware I was coming and I dealt with Rod from there. This is  where, in my opinion, things went downhill. Car was inside. Asked to take it for a ride. Rod went with me. Not a peep from him. I expected him to tell me of what the car had(options), and what they did. He only told me of the option to link my phone after I made(sarcastic) comments about 2-3 things in the car(including a sunglass holder).This is a basic car. I explained I wasn't interested in linking a phone , I'm a simple person and really don't use a cell phone. He makes the comment of \"I can tell you're simple, you're impressed with the sunglasses holder!\" Someone was begging me not to buy a car! Didn't care, need a car. Sick of driving junk. Get back, agree to buy it. Then comes the sales pitch of wrap around warranty. Mind you it's already certified. He gives me a price of $1615 for this coverage. Most of this is profit for them. I say no, still pressed. Tried to make it clear I just want the car. Without asking who's name it's to be in, the start the process without telling me. The wife notices what they are doing. I go into finance guy and tell him car has to be in both our names. He replies, sorry I already printed the title. Ha, funny. I told him either both our names are on the title or he can keep it. So they comply(attitudes are getting better!) Then comes the paperwork with this guy. No introduction, no hello. Possibly the rudest person, almost ruined the sale with his ignorant ass basically throwing papers at us and crying about his no commission and I wont buy the \"wrap around\" coverage. He basically called me stupid for not buying his overpriced coverage(which he kept changing the price of) Overall, I think I got a good deal on the car. It's a nice car. Never would I step into this dealership again unless the price was right.(this was around 2 months ago). If you go here, I hope they treat you better!",

Then wait some more. Then even more. Literally a half hour or more before the first order comes out. And we're 11 in line. Mind you we have a 12:30 show for a 2:00 departure back to Indy. \n\nSome lady comes in with a rolling shopping cart looks like it's full of books. Pushes her way through the line. An excuse me would have helped. Then proceeds to unload 40 clear plastic clam shell containers of various desserts onto the awkward counter. Now jamming the ordering line up even more. They did look good. Then she proceeded to touch up her nail polish while we stood there watching. \n\nThis is when I really started looking around. Floors. Sticky and disgusting. Walls. Equally disgusting. HVAC vent above the cash register. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the building was constructed. Then I started to notice the flies. Everywhere. \n\nOne nice enough lady taking orders. But then if you start trying to watch the kitchen staff it looks like most of them are back there bull shitting. We comment among ourselves about the clear operational inefficiencies as food slowly trickled out of the kitchen. After an hour of standing there I decide to go to the car get my iPad and finish up my preflight paperwork. On my way out I notice how the floor is sticky everywhere there's no rug, everything is just filthy looking. And the flies. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later, DMat comes out with the for and we head to airport. I talk about the filth, DM says yea that sanitation report was probably a 12 and someone used a sharpie to write a 95 on it cause you can't get close enough to read it. We laughed. We sit down to eat. It's ok. It's XXX hot. Get a little sweat on. \n\nWe change into uniform, get plane ready, passenger shows up. We leave for Indy. About halfway into the hour flight I feel queasy. Then sweaty queasy. I burp and get this nasty spoiled grease spicy make me want to puke burp. I say man I don't think I'm right. Tried chewing some gum and a little water. My minds racing for the possibly location of tums or Pepto in my backpack in the rear of plane. \n\nWe land at Indy and secure the plane, a Co worker we brought chicken back for him and his brother drops us at DM's house. We change and he drives me over in his badass Jeep CJ to my hotel. The whole time I'm looking for somewhere to grab cause I feel like I'm going to need to lean out and puke. \n\nAbout an hour later DM text me and said he was working around the house and got cold clammy sweaty and started to feel really ill to the point he called for his better half. Said when she came downstairs to him thought he was having a heart attack he looked THAT bad. \n\nWe eat spicy food. All. The. Time. Him and I look for spicy food on the road. Hot wings. Thai. Vietnamese. Indian. Chile and chili. Doesn't matter, we'll try it. Fresh jalapenos in the kitchen? Put them in my omelet. Hot peppers? Put them in my salad. Dinner? You guessed it, at least bring me some hot sauce. \n\nWe've had Hattie B's at their downtown and hills location. The shut your cluck heat level. Spicy wasn't the problem. This was food poisoning. Girls at airport told us Party Fowl just opened and they heard it's good. We may try that next time. Hattie B's is a clean efficient choice always. STCU never bothers us, well except for the burn on both ends. \n\nStomach still feels queasy as I write this 20hrs later. Good thing today's flights are two real short hops.",

I asked him what was the best one, he replied with the first of many sarcasms \"the one installed correctly\". He would not answer a direct question about what I needed as far as tonnage, return air placement, vent placement. He said that would all be figured out by algorithms. He then spent about 30 minutes bragging about how great THE $24,000 A/C system was that he put in his house and shared a few other of his useless life wisdoms. At this point I still do not know if he works for Keefe's or is some kind of scam artist.

Firstly staff member was smoking right outside the entrance, very tacky. Went in for pedicure, no one greeted me. She did help the guy who cleans the fish tank before me, which apparently the owner didn't sign the check to pay him. (Another professional move). Saw the sign in sheet filled it out Went to pick a color, which they have a repeat of a lot of same colors (I couldn't even find a mint or coral which is what I wanted). Waited around 5ish minutes and the girl said I'll get your water started...... waited a little longer finally got back to a chair which they were only about 25% full!! Should not of taken that long. Get to the chair....... the water barely covers my feet, it was warm for about 2 minutes. The massage chair was a cheap ass piece of shit. The seat had zero padding left, Screen was broke and kept stopping the massage after 30 seconds. Had to wait for the tech of course. When she finally comes over she's making a personal call. Trying to pretend with head phones she isn't. So by the time she starts the water if cold not even luke warm. The service was fine, I asked her to put on my sandals before she painted my toes. She didn't understand so I couldn't wear them out. Wasted throw away flip flops. Went to go pay the greeter girl was talking to other staff saw I was walking up, was following me. Then some lady walked in she greeted her, ignored me, which would of been fine if I wasn't ignored when I walked in. Finished helping her ran back said something to a coworker. Filled out a board thing, then finally ran me out. Then I got asked if I wanted to leave a tip, out-loud for all to hear. I of course left one because I got a serviced preformed,  but I felt that was also tacky, and a cheap way to make people feel obligated to tip more! Needless to say I will not be back, Paris salon is the same price maybe cheaper and much better service.",

I will update my stars and the review after I have gone \n\n\n\nI went to Boundary for brunch with some friends, and I have to say that it was quite disappointing.  Let me start of by saying that I was in the service industry for almost 12 years, and my friends are all retail veterans. Customer service is something we are all great at. The Boundary staff is another story. Our waitress wasn't attentive whatsoever, and quite frankly she had the personality of a wet rag. There was nothing there. Just all around BLAH. No smile, no chatting, no nothing. Even when we tried to joke with her a little.....NOTHING. We are a fun loving, polite, and friendly group. Let's not mention that we had to flag her down for refreshments. I then waited for a cider for almost 15 minutes, and the restaurant was NOT busy.  \nMy friend received cold food, and obviously sent it back. The manager then brought it back, and instead of apologizing, started going over how they pre-cook certain parts of her dish etc, and gave it back. I am not 100% sure if he threw it in the microwave for a bit, but she ended up sending it back all together after that. I completely understand that some foods are pre-cooked, and why, but when you then serve it cold, you need to apologize, and not make excuses. I apologize for things at my job, on a daily basis, even when I am in the right, because that is how customer service works. Then my other friend, who comes here all the time, ordered a burger, which she gets from there regularly, and asked for medium well, but received medium rare. Again the manager didn't offer an apology, but an explanation (aka. Excuse).  At this point my friend just said she would eat it, but considering the level of this establishment, I was expecting him to say that they would either a) take it off the bill, or b) offer her a drink or something for the mishap. We also wanted our 2 bottles of wine a little colder, and instead of bringing over wine buckets or chillers (that SHOULD have been standard for white wine), she brought us ice. Yes, ice for wine. I have worked at everything from a nightclub to fine dining, and this is NOT how you treat your customers. \nKeep in mind that even after all of this, we still tipped our waitress 20%.",

  "text": "Been a favorite for a long time, but going downhill fast.  Went last night with friends.  Lousy service, nasty waitress, drinks were terrible, beer served with two inches of fuzz, sent back for decent pour, came back worse than first, figured bartender did on purpose, sent back again, want what we're paying for.  Began to wait for dinner, sat one hour, place was not crowded, no waitress, no dinner.  People that came in after us were served and finished, still no dinner. Got up and left with total disgust.  Needless to say will never go there again and will spread this to everyone we know.  Not the first time we were disappointed there but this was the worst. Couldn't find a manager to talk too.  No wonder business is getting worse, no secret if this is how customers are treated.  By the way, a message to corporate, I know how I like my beer poured and it's not with 2-3 inches of foam on top, that's at least 4 ounce loss of fluid to the customer.  When you start paying or give it free then pour as you like but I don't want to hear \"that's a corporate policy\" !  Don't insult me or others with that bull...., your biggest profit is on alcoholic beverages, I was in the business.",

At first, service was great and food was great, but then service gradually became slower and slower and slower to the point where my party and I had to stand up and start putting our coats on just to get our check! After waiting a good 10-15 mins we finally got our check and paid the bill. My husband headed outside to get our car from the valet service while I paid the bill, thinking it would be quicker that way. Nope, not at all. We waited 25 minutes to get our car!!!! Absolutely unacceptable!! I'm not sure that I'd be so fast to dine here again, just because of the crappy and slow service.",

Checked the internet to find published late hours (Sunday night open until 10pm). We arrived at 9:05p to find the door locked bit the staff was still inside. We called and was told they were open and a very nice greeter explained that they were thinking of closing but everything was still up and everyone started walking towards a table. Then the a woman walked up from the back, appearing annoyed and told us \"we're closed!\" No apology, no gratitude -- just \"We're closed!\"  We left and walked across the street to another restaurant (with the same hours) that actually honored their published hours.\n\nAs I said, we've never had a bad experience in the past and we've eaten here numerous times.

We saw him waiting on other tables that had COME IN AFTER US and got increasingly annoyed. Finally we flagged down another server who went and got him, and he came back apologizing that he had, indeed, forgotten about us. What?? Isn't that your job?? We ordered and the food took a long time to get to us (again, tables who came in after us were getting their food and LEAVING before we had ours. There were only 2 of us). The bacon cheese poutine was awesome, the turkey sandwich was very dry, and the skillet cookie was amazing. However, we were running late to relieve our babysitter and before we ordered dessert we asked how long it would be to get. Answer: 7 minutes. In actuality, about 20 minutes and very late getting home. I'm not sure how good our waiter's sense of time was.",

Now a month later they say we hadn't paid the bill. So I go into their web site Sunday at 0400 and set up auto pay personally. Now Monday they shut off our service because we haven't paid. They have serious issues with their ability to process payments. Spoke to another couple in the store and they had the same problem. Sprint isn't as good as Verizon coverage wise and they certainly can't get their process of billing right. I think our trip to the Sprint store by Dicks today may be our last. Terrible corporate service. But the local folks in store are nice but they too are frustrated by corporate. Sadly when we were going to switch Verizon wouldn't do anything and now they offer just what we wanted a month ago.\n\nBe careful with Sprint, they have major problems beyond just dropped calls.",

My wife  asked the waitress  what she recommends she said  I don't know I'm not fan of barbecue. So I ordered the  pick three the food came  and the chicken was edible  but a  very small portion , the barbecue  beef brisket  once again was a small portion. With no flavor , the Barbecue  ribs were burnt to a  crisp . When  I told waitress she like I guess I could get you more .  Approximately 20 minutes  later more ribs  arrived  and they were no better. Finally the waitress got  the manager  who agreed  to remove it for check .  We left hungry as came  in . The best part of the meal was our drinks .",

  "text": "I was really excited to come to Taco Bell after I had a nice first experience at a location in Knoxville, TN. I don't blame the employees though, there was just some lack of communication with my order.\n\nI ordered the nachos, but with jalapeños instead of meat. Luckily, they didn't put any meat on but they did forget the jalapeños. The queso tasted worse than it did when I'd previously been to a Taco Bell. It's tolerable when mixed with the hot sauce and refried beans, but on a chip by itself it's rather awful. The other problem I had with it was the same problem that I had with my taco: I didn't ask for sour cream and I didn't know it'd be included. Even the best sour cream makes me nauseous, and I didn't know it would sneak it's way into my \"only beans, cheese, pico, and guac\" taco. Also, there was no guac to speak of.\n\nIn the future, I don't really think this place is worth splurging on my lactose intolerance for again. If I do decide to return, I'll try to make sure the communication is more clear.",

  "text": "I have had absolutely the worst experience with this company. I hired them to do 3 small jobs in my house. They came, completed them, and then massively overcharged me.  They also put a horribly ugly faucet in my bathroom as a replacement without first OKing with me. I went back and forth with the owner, Brian, about getting reimbursed for the overcharge and having the faucet replaced, and finally got him to agree to it.  My husband and I later realized that whatever they did to our kitchen sink caused us to not have any hot water. The owners brother came with the original plumber, and claimed that it was not from what they did, and told us we needed a new faucet. They also came with a check for the money I was owed, but it was made out to the wrong name. Since they left, my husband again spoke to Brian who assured us that he would come take a look himself. We have now tried reaching him and the company for over a week, their office phone goes right to voicemail, and no one is calling back. Our handyman was about to fix our sink in less than an hour without replacing the faucet. This company is horrible to work with, does not communicate, and the plumbers they hire are inept. I would NEVER work with them again.",

I tasted a heavy taste of celery flakes which was not pleasant. All you need for good fried chicken is some seasoned salt and flour, so I'm not sure why they are going through all these changes using celery flakes and whatever else. The hot sauce shouldn't have to flavor your chicken, that should just be icing on the cake, but I had to have hot sauce to flavor every bite. The cornbread was delicious but that's about it.

When they never showed up on the rescheduled date I called back and was told that there was no way to verify that they didn't perform the pickup, so they assumed that it was picked up as GPS showed the truck in our neighborhood (but they couldn't verify if it was at our house or not).\n\nSo, I cancelled service and figured I was done with this company.  Probably wouldn't have even bothered writing this review had I not received a bill for just under $80.00 to pick up the containers.

They offer very good mexican food I highly recommend chips and queso and they also always have a very good beer menu.\n\nBut sadly the staff every time I've been to Jose's has been very unfriendly not very helpful and sometimes just rude to myself or my group. Another frustrating fact for Jose's is their bathrooms are up about 3 flights of steps and is incredibly inconvenient to get to.\n\nI will continue to try this location because the food and beer is that good and hopefully the staff and can improve eventually.",

  "text": "Harrah's Reno Hotel and Casino \nOverall my trip was good , but my stay was disappointing. The room was clean but when my husband and I returned from our date in the evening a lot our belongings were stolen. We had made sure our door was locked before leaving so the only people with access to the room was hotel staff. My luggage and shoes were there but a shopping bag containing my dresses, curling iron, and all of my husbands clothes was taken.When I spoke to the receptionist about the incident my dresses and curling iron was returned to me but my husbands belongings were \"never found \". We then made a report to the hotel security and asked to speak to the manager but he was gone for the day and never got back to us. Security then said that in cases like ours nothing would be done by the hotel. Arriving to the hotel we made a refundable deposit of $100 in case of any damage to the room but the hotel doesn't really care for the belongings in the room. My stay was two nights. My husband and I were never given an apology or even offered a refund or discount.",

  "text": "I have used this vet for a couple years. It is the only vet i have used since moving to this area (the midwest) The staff is friendly but the visits always feel like a cursory review. I know they are busy but you want to feel your pet is cared for in a personal way. Or at least I do. I never had a complaint really, though, for the annual exams. Recently however my family had to make the difficult choice to euthanize our elderly dog who had become ill and would have needed at least one surgery we were not sure she'd even recover from. \n\nThis was an incredibly difficult choice and one I have only made once before. The first time, my dog was put on a table and covered in warm towels. His arm was shaved and he was given something to calm him and lull him into a deep painless sleep. I was given all the time needed to say goodbye and when I was ready that vet applied the lethal dose and my beloved dog went in his sleep. \n\nWhile All About Pets did give us time to say goodby while the dog was awake and with us, they had us immediately put our terrified dog who was disoriented with pain meds and still in pain on a set of blankets we had brought for her to take her home in. We thought we'd have more time once she was asleep and her anxiety had been alleviated, giving the kids a chance to see she would have no pain and would just drift off in her sleep. The dog was scared and struggling to get away as I held her to me so they could shave her arm. While she still struggled in terror, there was no peaceful sleep for us to take time a little more time to say goodbye, instead she was given the lethal dose immediately in her terrified state and died almost instantly without any peace. Her eyes open, her tongue out. She evacuated her bladder all over me as I had been holding her and no towels had been offered.\n\nI am horrified and haunted by this experience and knowing this wonderful creature's last moments on earth were scary and forced. Perhaps my last vet was just very compassionate and that experience was unique, but the experience at All About Pets impacted all of my family in a traumatic way and none of us will be returning or recommending them again.",

  "text": "I've been bringing my puppy to them for several years for grooming. Liz and Megan were wonderful. I made an appointment for my Shih Tzu three months ago at 11:00 am hoping she would be done around two. It got later and later and when I called there I was told probably another hour.  After another hour went by I called again and was told maybe a half hour more. They never said there was any sort of problem. I finally got a phone call after 4:00 that she was done. By the time I got there it was going on five. When I walked in it seemed like I was the only customer there. A young girl was holding her and she had put little bows in her hair. She really looked cute and I never got to thank her for putting the bows in. There was another woman there who was doing most of the talking and she told me I would be charged more because she was so matted. Several more workers came over and were telling me what kind of matting tool to use. I said I had that kind and I always used that on her. She was not matted that badly and I was told I would be charged for that. The woman who told me she was the groomer told me she had fleas. I was shocked and I said that I had never.seen a flea on her. Her vet would have told me if she had. The groomer at that time told me she was just infested with them and they had to give her a treatment. I couldn't believe it. A treatment. I use Frontline on her every month. They could have killed her. Of course I was told I would be charged for this treatment. Why didn't they tell me this when I called there twice in the afternoon. What were they doing with her from 11:00 to almost 5:00. She didn't smell like she had a treatment but I was constantly told that she had fleas and I of course would be charged. She never cut her nails and did not look as good as other times. The owners of Dog Wash Depot have always been very nice and always did a good job. It was a nice place to go to. I know I will never step foot in there again and neither will my friends.",

The ones we did choose had pretty good flavors but like the other reviews said, the fish in the rolls were scant and you can barely even taste any fish. They really skimp you on the most important thing when it comes to sushi lol. Salmon nigiri did not taste very fresh either. I expect a fresh clean taste and smooth buttery texture when it comes to salmon but this was chewy, room temperature and tasted a bit \"fishy\".

I want all visitors to know about it. \n\nI am not going to talk too much about the food. We ordered the cajun fries, NO favorites, redfish and bread pudding.  They were tasty.\n\nThe real kicker of the story here started when we got done ordering our food.  I felt something smack against the side of my face. When I reached for it, I felt it move down onto the table.  We then realized that there was a 3 inch long roach right there on our table crawling around. I jumped out of my seat right away because I am absolutely terrified of roaches. A few moments later, the staff came by, and \"took care of it\".  We changed table but I was so traumatized that the rest of the dinner was less than enjoyable.  \n\nOur young waiter came and was somewhat apologetic about it.  He even told me about a time a roach jumped down his shirt. Thanks for that mental image...not. We ate our dinner and then came the bill.  I was so surprised to see our bill charged as full, given to us without another word of apology. No, no, no.. I asked to speak with the manager, and came a gentleman wearing a red tie.  I explained the incident to him calmly, and he explained that the restaurant passed all health checks and that they have no control over the court yard where the roaches can come from.  Um... did he just try to justify this?  I pressed on and said how is a roach landing on your customer INSIDE the restaurant an expected outcome of dining here? And then he got defensive and said that roaches can fly wherever they want and there isn't anything he can do.  I was furious at that point. Not because a roach landed on me, but because this manager thought my poor dining experience in his restaurant was not his problem.  A few more rounds back and forth, he suggested a 10% discount and free dessert.  I didn't think he was going to be more sympathetic than that so we paid the bill and left with a bitter taste in our mouths.  With so many good places nearby, I cannot recommend anyone to dine here if you care about good dining experience. YIKES.",

I was told by the manager that the pretzels were sticking to the bottom of the oven and that they were very busy this morning. Also told that the owner was the person who made these pretzels. So that tells me the owner doesn't care about the quality of the product he's serving to the public. And to think, I was gonna place a large order for the Super Bowel. I definitely will not be placing my order with this location. Only received my 2.25 back, didn't offer a free pretzel or anything for my inconvenience. Won't be coming back to this location. Very disappointed.",

Well, now there is plenty of competition near this Outback such as Grand Luxe, Yard House and Longhorn, etc. I am not even a fan of Longhorn but even that is better than this Outback. I have been to other Outback's and they are much better. The Proprietor Sue Midiri needs to make some serious changes if she wants this restaurant to survive. I have given this restaurant one too many chances, so shame on me for coming again. The food was cold and the service was lack luster. There is no excuse for poor service since the restaurant was empty. The bartender was horrible and he could not make a good Wallaby Darned. Needless to say I will never, ever, ever come here again! Bye Outback!!",

  "text": "I purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance with all the options.  Since I live in Knoxville, this Tesla location was the closest one for pickup.  Unfortunately, the experience was not very good.  When I arrived, the salesperson wanted to rush me through the paperwork before I had even seen the car.  I'd imagine a dealer selling a used Honda would've put more effort into the delivery.\n\nWhen I inspected the car, the interior was dirty and there was a small nick in the door.  Also, the spoiler and \"Dual Motor\" badge were not included on the car (even though I paid for that option).  The salesperson was rude about the situation, said the missing items would be installed \"post delivery,\" and made a snide remark about how Tesla's mission was a little different than other luxury car manufacturers.  These types of condescending remarks annoyed me.  Obviously, as someone buying the car, I understand Tesla pretty well and agree with their goals.\n\nThe workers also barely spent any time showing me how to use the car.  For the Model 3 (which is so different from a normal car), this was a little frustrating to me.  Fortunately, as I'm not that old (yet), I figured it out quickly.  But, I'd hate to think how someone less facile with technology would do with orienting themselves.\n\nOVERALL:  Tesla seems to be a great company and the cars are all really cool!  But, this location really needs to step up their service.  Treat customers better.",

  "text": "If you are not a white local, don't bother! Please bear with me. I want to be very clear and fair...In NOLA to celebrate my birthday and this was to be the special birthday meal. We were so excited but experienced a colossal disappointment. Gentlemen at front (proprietor?)  was ok initially-acknowledged my birthday and even put some confetti on the table. Very nice. That was the end of any niceties. This waitstaff was cold and apathetic. Receipt says Benjamin was our server. Honestly, he was the worst but at least he actually spoke to us. Assistant (water, bread, dessert never spoke a word and food runner practically threw dessert on the table). About the food - I had the beet and fried goat cheese salad which was lovely but very short on beets. Proportion of frisée to beet was out of wack but when you got it all in your mouth it was delicious. We also had the scallop appetizer which seemed to have three totally different sized scallops that cooked differently (perfect to chewy) but sausage with it was tasty. Veal cheeks were a very generous portion and perfectly braised; but the tarragon was overwhelming and root veggies way undercooked; so I swapped with my husband who ordered the snapper which was good. We ordered creme brûlée which was burnt and bitter. Benjamin saw we only ate two bites and did actually ask if we liked it (first time he did that with any of the food or wines we ordered). When we told him we thought it was burnt he just said he would take it off the bill. No  \"I'm sorry\" or \"Would you like to try something else?\" He just took it away. We eat at a LOT of great restaurants in NOLA. This was the Solid worst. Also dark and loud. Bad energy. Felt total disdain from all staff. In such a diverse town known for its food and hospitality we picked the one homogenous place that didn't care if we lived or died. So be it. But if you don't want a brown tourist to eat there, get off Open Table.",

  "text": "I recently left this company after 2 1/2 years of employment. They cut my final check, I cash it and begin to pay my bills to float me through until my next job starts as you can understand as I'm a single father with 3 children. Now how my bank and alot of banks work is they make the funds available even though the check is still pending confirmation. Few hours later I get a call saying they've over paid me and need the check back well sorry I've already deposited the check and paid multiple bills like my rent and car payment. So what do they do they put a stop hold on the check pull the funds back out of my account and cause me to go negative and get multiple fees on my account do to insufficient funds and payments being returned. Now when I call Chelsea in payroll and ask if they're going to reimburse me for the fee's she tells me no she gave me \"ample\" time. I'm sorry but ample time is not calling me after I've already deposited the check into my account nor is it my issue that you've made a mistake in the first place. Now I'm responsible for over $200 in fees due to their mistake. This is the first time I've had to go through this but it's not the first I've heard or seen of them messing up payroll. This company is also the perfect example of a \"right to work state\" and is a revolving door and have a extremely high turnover rate as they will let you go for no reason and without warning. I know first hand as I transferred departments because of this. They charge you a fee for phones and mail, work outfit, and so on. They have many great people working for them that I thoroughly enjoyed working with but they do not have the employee's interest in mind nor do they own there mistakes. If your looking into applying for this company I'd look elsewhere. I'd do your research as I'm sure they'll just burry this review with a long list of fake good ones like the rest of the bad reviews that are more than likely true. I'm glad this company is behind me.",

  "text": "I purchased a used 2011 Volvo xc90 6 months ago and have already had over $7,000 worth of \"repairs\" done to it.  I initially brought the vehicle back to Keystone 2 months after purchase because the battery completely died, even though it was brand new when I bought it.  This visit they tried to charge me over $500 dollars to have a \"Software\" update done which was supposedly draining the battery....Why wasn't this caught before you sold the vehicle to me? You do run diagnostics on your vehicles don't you?\nI next brought the vehicle in because the oil light went on. This turned out to be a leaking oil pump($750) and while you are here you need two new tires because it \"looks like their is in metal in the tire somewhere\".  The oil light trip ended up costing $1,200....this time.  I next received a suspect phone call back from the dealership telling me that I needed to bring my vehicle back in because of the oil light?  Apparently the pump wasn't the only problem and now they need to look and the pistons and possibly replace all of them($4k-$5k)? But \"Don't worry, this trip will be fully covered by Volvo\".....Volvo did cover the pistons, but they did not cover the clutch  belt which apparently is in dire need of replacement!! \"We do not feel safe letting you leave without replacing this!!\".  This ended up costing another $500.....\"But this would have been a lot more sir because we are waiving the labor since we already have the engine apart\".  Ohhh then please take my money!!  They just don't get it here.  The \"Owner\" called me 10 minutes ago and literally got defensive and yelled at me on the phone.  \"I am happy that I won't have you as a customer in our future because all of my customers are pleased with my dealership\".  No SIR, They are not!! It is clear to see why the reputation of this business is shit! It starts at the very top and trickles down to its every level.",

We declined the table and requested a better location. We then decided to observed how long it would take for other diners to be seated at that location... nobody... until another interracial couple arrived about 30 minutes later, also well dressed, very dignified and younger than us. They too apparently complained about the table and were also reseated elsewhere. That table was not occupied again, while we were there, until there were no more available seats in the restaurant. SAD! What should have been an enjoyable dinner experience on our visit to New Orleans was marred by the discriminatory treatment we received.

We were the first on the balcony and I bought drinks on the way out there. We found our table and watched the end of the soccer match prior to NFL starting. Great start! Perfect weather. Then, more people came and received service from what appeared to be wonderful staff. My wife and I waited, no service. More and more people came, sitting at tables next to us receiving service. Us? Not a server to be had. I finally waived one down, asking for the tv to be changed (needed a remote) and he said he would be right back. Never saw him again! Needless to say, I had to get up for drinks any time we wanted one. I really, truly wanted to stay, spend my money and enjoy my birthday watching football in an amazing place, but it was not to be. When another couple joined us, they, too, did not get service. He went in and asked for a server. When she came out, she acted as we were bothering her! During the well over an hour we were there, we never did get the tv changed or orders taken. Sad, really.",

  "text": "Went there on a Saturday mid May about 4pm.  Should have known when we saw it was not busy at all by the looks of the parking lot.  Getting inside, we were seated right away, but noticed two tables near us were not cleared or cleaned.  It stayed that way for over half an hour.  We went there because Applebees was running a special this month on Dos Equis beer.  The add said they offered both the lager and amber.  The waitress took our drink order and had no idea of the amber one, saying they only had one tap beer of Dos Equis and it was the lager.  I said ok and she went to get it, returning with out saying they were out.  How do you run out on a Saturday afternoon when your promoting that beer.  We should have just left, but we didn't.\nWe completed the order and don't get me wrong, the server was nice but never saw a hint of a manager and other than the server, no one acknowledged us as there.  The food came out, and it was one of their specials with steak and shrimp.  I'm not a food snob but the shrimp was tasteless.  I ordered the steak medium and should have ordered rare, as it came out well.  I just didn't want to waste anymore time there so I just kept the steak.  The server did ask if the food was alright.  It told her it was ok and not medium, but was not going to have her refire another.\nJust very disappointed in this Applebees and was the worst one yet.  Usually we get pretty good food, but it's been a long while since we have gone to this one....now I know why.",

He was a smoker and left a cigarette butt on my property as well as nails that were found later.  He installed the glass for us and left the screen and never tried it to make sure it fit.  Now when we went to put our screen door in it was bowed and would not seal correctly.  I called them to come check it out which they did a week later.  They told me 5 weeks ago they would order me another screen door as I can use glass or screen.  I just called today to find out they never even ordered the screen door.  It will be quite cold soon and I won't be able to enjoy the screen door because of what they called \"an honest mistake\".  I paid a lot of money for these doors and that is not the service I would expect.  I am very disappointed and now I have to wait another two weeks maybe to even get the doors in and than however long it takes for someone to bring it out.  Not happy at all but they got paid.",

  "text": "Disclaimer: I've definitely come here before and had really good pizza. This time around I left very disappointed in the product.\n\nI got a personal Paulie's pie. It was supposed to come with meatballs, sausage, sweet or hot peppers and ricotta cheese. It ended up costing $19. I was not happy with what I received. My main complaint is that I asked for long hots and the peppers that came on the pizza were whole and not de-seeded. They didn't even bother cutting them up or seemingly touching them at all before throwing them on the pizza. They made the pizza very unwieldy to eat and I ended up pulling them off and cutting them up myself so I didn't just get whole mouthfuls of pepper. Also I don't think there was any sausage on the pizza. For what it's worth, there were plenty of meatballs on the pie. However, the toppings made it impossible to appreciate the sauce or the dough. Overall, I was very unimpressed by the pizza and turned off from coming here again. When I spend $30, I expect to get more than a beer and a really mediocre pizza.",

Called and placed an order for pick up around 1:45 and ordered a beef bowl, seemed more like a rice bowl, I was so excited to try it being my first time and all and was so disappointed because of the amount of beef it had according to the manager and owner of this business  (Lakman Perrera) it has to have 6 ounces of beef, called the store around 7 and asked to speak to a person in charge or a manager and was passed to this horrible rude man. I told him that I was no satisfied with my meal and why I wasn't satisfied with it because of the under portioning of meat keep in mind this bowl was $15 and had nothing but rice and veggies, asked him nicely if I can come in and show him the plate and he told me to bring it the next day around lunch time... told him if I can come in about 5 min and maybe get my meal replaced or a refund and was told that he didn't believe anything I was saying and also that if I didn't like the food then don't come back and then hung up one me, I was so shocked with what he had told me,my husband called about 15 min later and asked him nicely if we can bring him the food and show him that we were not lying about the under portioning of the food and he told him that if he didn't like the food then that's not his problem. We were both in shock, please don't not come back here don't spend money on this horrible restaurant you'll just be disappointed and not satisfied at all just a waste a money.

  "text": "First off, I was very excited to try this place out after looking at their menu.  We came here for brunch on a Sunday and chose between their brunch specials and lunch menus.  Two in our group opted for the unlimited mimosas for $10 (which I was told were very weak) and everyone but me ordered a speciality pizza. Their pizzas looked great and the three of them was were fully satisfied with their buffalo chicken, Korean and Greek pizzas.  I opted for their buffalo chicken sandwich.  This is where I was extremely disappointed.\n\nTheir buffalo chicken sandwich aka the Voodoo chicken sandwich states that it is \"crispy buffalo chicken breast, voodoo chips, tomato, melted cheese, lettuce, ranch, with a side of fries.\"  First off, the sandwich comes out on a very hard sliced baguette (which isn't the best bread to even eat a sandwich, let alone it being very hard, barely able to bite into).  The lettuce on the sandwich is shredded and melted into the cheese, ok, no big deal, right?  But the issue I had was that the chicken was just a fried chicken breast, no seasoning, no buffalo sauce, nothing.  If you order a buffalo chicken sandwich anywhere, it comes wet.  This had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I was bummed and my friend took the liberty of saying something to the waiter since I didn't want to be a pain.  The waiter said \"oh, it's seasoned\" and I begged to differ.  He then got the manager (10 minutes later) and the manager questioned why I was not happy.  I clearly stated it wasn't a buffalo chicken sandwich and he looked at me dumbfounded.  I began to just shrug it off while my entire table was practically done with their meals (obviously offering me some slices since i wasn't eating my own order) and the manager said he can take that chicken and toss it in buffalo sauce.  I told him not unless you are giving me a new piece of chicken because the cheese and lettuce are melted together onto the chicken, that would not taste good.  He then just looked at me with a blank stare, and i just said \"never mind it's not worth it\".  He left and we proceeded to get our bill.  I was shocked that the sandwich wasn't discounted and there was no apology that my order was not given to me as advertised.  \n\nAs of now, I do not want to go back, despite their extensive drink menu and other great looking pizza I can try.  In time, I might be back to try the pizza but I am just very disappointed in the lack of customer service I got from management.  I left hungry and got food elsewhere afterwards.",

  "text": "I heard this location was opening and wanted to try it out. Came here on 3/11/18 and yes it was packed, which is a good thing in a sense considering it just recently opened, it's a weekend and I'm sure everyone was here to check it out. I really liked the gravity ropes course and all the fun arcade games. The line was pretty long for laser tag so we didn't get a chance to do that and I didn't book online to reserve lanes for bowling but that was fine because I was just happy with playing the arcade games. Unfortunately, it seemed as though Main Event catered more to you if you were bowling because you had your own area to sit and hangout for awhile which is probably why you won't be able to get anything upon arrival. It's a shame because if you don't do your research ahead of time, you won't be able to get the full experience. There could be a better management of that. Also, the bar restaurant area definitely had more seating and it's only available to those patrons. Labelle pizza had a very limited number of seats which made it very hard if you made a large order. There's approximately 10 tables??? The line stretched all the way back towards the arcade floor and the tables that were filled, even if they finished eating they stayed there to have a place to keep their belongings so that was frustrating. Tables nearby were for parties only which is fine but I do feel it could've been managed much better as far as having the employees make sure seating is open to patrons that are dining.  If that was the worse thing about Main Event, I'd still return because I'm sure it would improve over time. The worse thing we experienced that day was the majority of the employees. Most had an attitude when we asked for assistance with different games and things like that. I understand if it's not your job or something you're unfamiliar with, just tell the customers that you don't know but will find someone who does. Instead, they would suck their teeth and act as if we were annoying them. Customers are what's going to keep businesses open and are the reason the employees have jobs, the same jobs they chose to apply for knowing they would be working with people. I could see if I came and asked them to do open heart surgery, yes that would give them every right to think I was crazy but I simply asked about certain games or ticket machines that have malfunctioned.  I did not expect anyone to magically turn into an expert on how to fix the machines but I did expect better customer service to help rectify the issue. There simply wasn't much effort put into it. I know that it was busy and there were numerous issues at hand but no one resolved the issue. If that was done for every customer that day then I guess Main Event won't be open that long. Everyone pays just like the next person, even if I didn't spend a lot that day, who's to say I haven't or won't spend more during a different visit. My family and I had a great time during our visit from the moment we walked in but it wasn't until the end where something as simple as someone's attitude towards us, made us leave feeling frustrated and not wanting to return. I really hope over time these issues really improve, especially when it comes to the staff. They should know and/or be trained to deal with complex situations in an extremely fast paced environment and properly handoff customer escalations instead of ditching them. I would definitely like to come back moreso during the week when it may be a little less crowded but I will definitely pay more attention to how the staff treats us. I really hope this feedback helps because my intention is not to offend anyone.",

No small business boxing gym I've been to makes you do any contract or sign up fee.  The trainers are ok but I don't find a lot of them motivating and they take a while to get to you if you have a question.  The group equipment smells like feet and when I inquired about it they said it was because they only clean it once every 24 hours...obviously not very well (again have not had this issue elsewhere).  The solution I was offered was to spend MORE money at the gym by buying my own overpriced equipment.  When you terminate your contract, you have to pay for the next payment period as well which resulted in another 30 days of unused gym time.  I also find it ridiculous how much they charge for personal training on top of the monthly fee.  Spend your money elsewhere, even chains like LA Fitness have better pricing than this place.",

I went in Thursday to start looking around .. I was basically ignored and even spent 15 minutes browsing. There was a sales person with a white coat on and was too busy to bothered as she was stocking makeup in the front of the store .. left and decided to come back the next day. a Friday .. even took a ulta bag  from the lobby to show I was getting a few items .. this time at least she yelled to me welcome to ulta but that was it ..it was the same sales clerk and was too busy to come up to me because she was too busy stocking the same exact spot as the day before .. after 10' minutes I left .. with several other ultras are close this one won't get my money",

  "text": "I have had experience dealing with other consignment shops in Tucson.   I have found that they are hit or miss with inventory and clothing they will accept.  I have found this shop to be less than friendly, especially to consignors.  I have brought almost new items in and watched them turn their nose up.  I am very careful to bring things that are not \"donate only\" items.  I have had nothing active in the store since March, 2018.  Since I heard nothing on the status of my items, I stopped in to get my check and was told that I missed the pay-out time for the month (by 3 days).  Now I have to wait until November 15 before they pay out again.  The $2 charge to write you a check for your money is ridiculous as well.  I am done dealing with this store and will continue dealing with Post Boutique instead.  Much easier to do business with and very friendly staff.",

  "text": "Everything about our stay here was disappointing. \n\nFirst: the construction going on at the hotel made checking in confusing. There were zero signs telling us where to go, just one sign for the elevator. When we got off the elevator, we had to ask someone where to go to check in (it's the restaurant, FYI). Once we checked in, we had to deal with the elevators. We had to take a specific elevator to go down, but pushing the button calls both. So of course the wrong one comes and you have to trick it to get the other one to come. \n\nI understand construction. But some of the issues we had were not due to construction. Like the drain. The drain wasn't installed properly in the bathroom, so every time you turned the sink on it would stop the drain. We finally had to pull out the stopper. The bathroom door not shutting properly was also ridiculous. It's a door. They're not hard to replace. I actually got stuck in the bathroom, and I had to pull while my husband pushed on the door. \n\n\nThe manager did call us after I complained on Twitter? but last time we had a problem at a Marriott property and wanted to change rooms, we sat around waiting for over an hour waiting on a return phone call. So, we just decided to stay put this time. But overall this was a terrible experience & I would absolutely NOT recommend this property.",

There was a manager and two workers behind the counter and the restaurant got a little busy and they were completely overwhelmed. We were given someone else's order and it took around 10 minutes for them to give us the correct order. The manager did apologize to us for the trouble. Then, after we got our order, the manager started yelling REALLY LOUD at a customer at the drive-through. She was telling the customer, I'm going to call the police on you, or something like that. For a minute I thought maybe there was someone with a gun or something but then I figured out it was just an unhappy customer. It disturbing and not an enjoyable experience and  I will not go back. They didn't have enough people working there. The bill was over $20 for 2 people and the way we were treated was completely unacceptable. The fries and milkshake were good but the sandwich wasn't that good. The bread was kind of soggy.",

Long check-in lines, arrived to the room on the 21st floor, it was extremely hot.  Room did not have a mini-fridge or microwave.  I turned on the AC which only blew more hot-air.  Called to complain at 6pm, also requested that they unclog the bathroom sink and shower.  They never showed up.  Called again,  finally at 9:45pm a maintenance guy knocked on the door.  Our kids were already asleep so I asked him to return the next morning, which he never did.  So we cracked the window open to cool down.  It would only open about 8 inches, so not much air would flow in.  Then the cargo train noises all night long kept us awake.  We thought about changing rooms, but with the long check-in lines, kids and all of our stuff, we just suffered through the second night.  Room was not very clean, one light was out so I pulled back the night-stand to re-plug in the light, I nearly barfed by all the old scraps of food that had fallen behind the bed and stand, but never cleaned.  Needless to say, we'll never return.  Pay the extra money and sleep somewhere else.",

What we thought was the manager told the hostess we couldn't sit outside, but were told by one of the wait staff we could have a seat while they cleaned the table for us. We checked a 2nd time because we thought we were being ignored. He gave us a plain \"no you can't sit outside.\" The restaurant was closing in an hour so we decided to have a seat inside because we just wanted dinner. \n\nAfter we ordered two chicken pad Thais and sangrias, we waited for our dinner in hopes it would be better than the horrible greeting we received when we walked in. We were incredibly disappointed in the sangrias, tasted little alcohol and did not come close to sangrias we have had before. We decided to keep them because maybe after a few sips it would get better. By this time, our food arrived. After the first bite, it felt like we were eating noodles drenched in salt. We have both had pad Thai from authentic Asian and Asian-Fusion restaurants, but never this bad. \n\nThe one upside was that we didn't have to pay for the entrees but had to find another place to have dinner.

They told me to sit and wait. At around 7PM another registration lady took my info. Around 7:20 I went back. Not terrible, I kind of expected to wait. \n\n\nIt's not 9:10PM no resolution HAVE NOT seen a doc yet. They did give me an IV which the tech butchered, he dug around in my arm then went into my hand. My veins are great, I've given my self multiple IV's when I was a medic in the military. I am hydrated and can clearly see some very easy veins. That didn't bother me since I was already in pain. What bothered me is they said a doc would be in and then some random guy shows up to take blood for an issue I hadn't talked to a doc about yet. \n\n\nThey had me go to the restroom to give some samples. I walked in to THE MOST DISGUSTING bathroom I have ever seen. Toilet paper wrappers and literal Poo all over the place. It had lint and stuff all over meaning it hasn't been wiped down in a while. It was really rough and I've pooped in the ground in Iraq. This is just ridiculous. I hope this helps someone and you diverge from traveling here. \n\nI never thought I'd say this... I miss the VA medical center  yeah, something is wrong here.\n\nI will update this IF the resolution comes.",

We were told to sit anywhere so we picked a table close to the bar.  We waited about 10 minutes and no one ever came by to ask what we wanted.  I asked my wife is we were invisible just to be sure.  I would have been happy with even someone yelling across the room with some sort of acknowledgment we were even there.   \n\nI could understand if we had snuck in with a crowd and sat in the corner but since we were the only table with people I assumed someone would notice.   A patron who came in after us walked by and mentioned it would get busy later because of the band.  Pretty sad when the only one who notices you is another patron. \n\nI guess they have food since they supposedly have a kitchen but I don't know if it's any good or not.  I can say their service is not bad it is non existent.   \n\nThere is an upside to our Crehan experience,  we left and ended up at 4204 on Main St and had an exceptional experience and some outstanding food.",

We waited 25 minutes more before my partner, Sychaeus, got his breakfast. Poor Sychaeus, he is so patient. No wait staff said anything about it either, no apology or info. So I ate while he watched. I felt really uncomfortable with that and as the time passed I grew anxious and lost my appetite. Just as we were about to leave, his food came. \n\nIf you have hours to kill, like our immortally damned to Dis souls, this may all be fine. Yet, I really love my partner and wanted him to feel happy and important. Don't worry, he's happy and everything is wonderful but we will be hesitant to return on a Sunday. There are many more places to eat beyond the great flames of Dis, where my poor Sychaeus doesn't have to wait out his eternity, watching me revel in the glorious carnal treats of this earthly paradise.",

  "text": "Very bad experience with this location and management.  I placed a larger order for delivery (9 sandwiches and some sides).   When I placed the order, it was reviewed and confirmed that the order was correct.  When we received the food, which was very timely (only positive of this), all but 1 sandwich was wrong.  Unfortunately, most that had placed orders didn't know each other and many had food allergies so touching the sandwiches and finding out it wasn't right, then swapping out with someone else wasn't really acceptable.  Therefore, most didn't get to eat.  \nWhen I called the restaurant, I asked for the manager.  I explained what had happened, with some hopes of resolution.  First explanation was that it was the fault of the \"new guy\" that took the order.  I explained that the \"new guy\" reviewed the order with me and read it back correctly, so the order that was taken was how we wanted to sandwiches.  It was not his fault.  However, what we received was completely different than what he read back to me.  The manager's response then was, \"Sorry, what do you expect me to do about it?\"  My reply was a simple, \"I'm not sure but a little more than I'm sorry?\"  He rambled on about how they're changing things with their training so that this type of stuff doesn't happen and on and on.  He did eventually offer to remake the sandwiches and send them out to us.  I declined as the people that were supposed to eat the sandwiches were leaving in 20 minutes for the airport.  They had an international flight and were not going to have time to get food on the way (which is why we ordered Jimmy Johns, \"Freaky Fast\").  They might be fast, and they were, but not correct.\nDissatisfied with the customer service that I received from the store, I called the corporate office.  I was told that this is a franchise store so they have not control over them.  She did say that she would forward my complaint on to the owner of the store and that he would be in contact with me within the next 24 hours.  Here's a snippit from the email I received from her:\n \"Thank you for contacting Jimmy John's Customer Service. My name is Emma and I am a Customer Service Team member located at Jimmy John's headquarters in Champaign, Illinois.\nI'm sorry to hear that you weren't happy with your experience at the Indianapolis Jimmy John's location. I understand how upsetting it is to crave some Jimmy John's and not receive what you ordered!\nThis location is independently owned and operated by one of our franchisees, so I shared your feedback directly with the owner.\nWe hope you'll visit again and give the Indianapolis team an opportunity to make it right.\nIf you need anything, please contact me at enewman@jimmyjohns.com or 866.276.6302.\n\nThanks,\"\n\nIt's been 2 weeks now and I've not heard from the owner.  I did receive a $10 gift card in the mail this past week.  Our order was $110.  \nI won't be ordering from Jimmy Johns anymore.",

  "text": "I had previously complained about this Taco Bell location and its notoriously poor customer service to the corporate website. That complaint which was made last year seemed to have fallen on deaf ears because the specific employees I had complained about are still working at said location. \n  First, a little about my experience in the past. I had a minor complaint that could have easily been dealt with but when I asked the girl (yes she was a teenager, most employees are at this location) to ask the manager to fix the complaint she just advised me that he was busy. Did not ask anyone; just told me this. Then when I asked for his name and the owner's name. I received a reply of \"German\" for his name. No name for the owner and a bogus phone number. The girl preparing food next to what I assumed to be the manager(male) at the time (again another teenager) rolled her eyes and said, \"Doesn't she know our DM quit!\" She couldn't have stood any closer to him if she tried. I informed them that they would be losing my business and I would be contacting corporate. Their exact response: \"We are a franchise. We are not owned by corporate.\"Not only did I say that they represent Taco Bell, but I said they would be losing my business as I would now be having to travel to another Taco Bell rather than deal with their service a block from my house.\n\n    This visit was an improvement yet still messed up the order as is always the case. There was one gentleman in front of me ordering in the dining room. I ordered after him. He got his food and left. I overheard the conversation on the backline of this Taco Bell as I was wondering what was taking my 1 item of food so long. I ordered the new Nacho Fry Bell Grande. Turns out they had given the gentleman in front of me my order as well as his and had to make me a new one. This among other food mishaps are consistent to the point customers must check their food every time to make sure it is correct and all items are there.\n  I'm really not trying to bash on these employees considering the fast food industry is where I got my start and I continued for 6 years before moving on to bigger things to pursue my passions. I just have a hard time when the employees make the customer feel like it is an inconvenience on them (employees) to serve the customer not only food but with respect as well. This is now happening too frequently to count.",

You live and you learn, but I will not be back. \n\nI arrived with a party of 6 around lunchtime on a Saturday and we were seated right away.  We all ordered food and drinks shortly after being seated, and our drinks were brought out promptly.  Our food, on the other hand, took AN HOUR to arrive.  And it arrived cold.\n\nI got their nutella crepe, my girl friend got their golden monkey crepe, her husband got a burger and fries, one of our other friends got an omelet, all completely cold.  I think maybe two of the dishes came out hot, but they were served in small cast-iron skillets, so that couldn't have hurt. Everything I tried seemed like it could've been pretty good if it was served hot, but I'll never know, because I would never go back here.\n\nAside from the disappointing food, the dining room is also very small.  I wouldn't imagine a party much larger than ours could hope to find a table during peak hours.  The bathrooms were also very dark, with two of the four light bulbs in the vanity being burnt out.  \n\nLike I said, not a fan and I wouldn't recommend this place.

My friend and I booked this salon prior to a special formal event for hair and makeup; we chose it for the location and the fact I've always liked Aveda salons for the special little extras they offer (hand massages, facials, foot soaks, etc.). Our appointments were late in the afternoon on a Saturday.  Perhaps this was our downfall? We were offered no special little \"extras\" at all.  My hair was pinned up but the stylist used so much hairspray I felt like I was back in the 80's with my Aqua Net.  My hair was super stiff, but about an hour later the front pieces she'd pulled out and curled were flat.  My friends hair fell flat, as well in the same period of time.  Our makeup seemed haphazard and rushed.  Although it was a warm day, we both had to touch up (I had to essentially do mine over) before we left for the event. I really didn't feel special and/or glamorous at all and honestly could have done my hair and makeup better myself.  We paid over $250 (including tip) for both of our services and I feel we really didn't get our money's worth for this price.  \nPerhaps their regular clients have better experiences here; I really wish we would have!",

A 6 piece chicken and an egg roll was all that I ordered. When the cashier took the order and I paid, he did not give a receipt. (IF YOU ARE GETTING TAKEOUT HERE, AFTER TOU PAY, GET YOUR RECEIPT!!) After I pay and he takes the order, we have a seat in their \"waiting area\" right at the door. Time moves along and we realize we have been waiting for over 20 minutes for a simple order. I then question how long it will be as we have been waiting a while and I am then told the food will be ready in 1 minute. 5 minutes pass and at that point I'm angry. I then go to request a refund and what do ya know, the small order comes up. I go to take the order from the now different cashier (who was there when my order was placed) and she asks for a receipt before she gives me the food. I tell her no receipt was given when we paid almost a hour ago and she then takes the food, goes over to the other hostess to ask if i truly paid as if I was trying to steal a 6 piece and an egg roll!! A second cashier also had to ask if it was paid for. I then had to explain the guy who took the order didn't give a receipt, took the food outta her hand and left. The amount of hunger and anger I experienced at this place will never be forgotten and I will never spend my money or encourage anyone else to spend their money here. Trust me. A better experience awaits you in the same plaza with better food at Beijing House. Thank me later.",

As others have stated, the representatives use a script that is often unhelpful and there is no way to speak to upper management other than sending a hard copy letter to a corporate office in Wayne, Pennsylvania. I filed my claim 2 weeks ago, and every day I am given a new reason that the 3-5 day review process has restarted. As just a few examples, I asked if any additional paperwork needed to be submitted to substantiate my original claim, and I was told that the claims filing process was comprehensive. 3 days letter, I checked my online claim and found that they required more information, including an original purchase receipt (even though no one contacted me to tell me that). I uploaded it immediately and called to inquire how long this would slow down the process, and was told 3-5 days and there was no way to expedite. Then I received an email that the receipt was missing 5 categories of information that were clearly present on the receipt. I spoke to another representative who explained that the processing department just made a mistake and he would push it through to be processed again. I asked him if any additional documentation might be requested so I could upload it to my claim. He assured me nothing further was needed, and he understood Assurant was responsible for the delay. But guess what happened anyway? That began the clock over. Then I checked my online account again the next day and saw that the \"duplicate\" receipt was again marked as \"unacceptable\" because it did not list the serial number. I called again and explained xfinity mobile didn't include serial numbers on the purchase receipts. I was told to handwrite the serial number on the invoice because all the information needed to be together. I asked if I should also upload a separate document with the serial number in an abundance of caution and was told that unnecessary documents could slow the claims process down. I uploaded the invoice with the handwritten number and was guaranteed by 3 different supervisors that my claim would be expedited because the service had been so atrocious. The next thing I know I checked my claim and the serial number was rejected because it was HANDWRITTEN. You can't make this stuff up. I was again told by multiple supervisors that they would monitor my claim and make sure my replacement phone shipped the next day. No one contacted me. I called again, and was told that there was now an IT issue holding up the claim, because an analyst accidentally put the wrong date for when the phone was released, which made it seem like I lost my iPhone XR before it had even been released. Obviously this too was not my fault, but it again re-started the 3-5 day claims process. And my only option to complain or speaker to higher level management is to write a letter to corporate. I will certainly be doing so and canceling my policy going forward, but I am amazed this company is even able to stay in business. It's a disgrace. The entire point of paying for insurance is to receive a replacement phone quickly in the event of loss. Instead, filing a claim through Assurant requires basically a full time job of staying on top of incompetent people, and doing so still does not result in a replacement device.",

I asked if there was any recommendations for the banh Mi. She unemphatically started to list meats that were already on the menu. It was not helpful at all. I almost felt like I offended her and she was listing the names as if I should have already looked at the menu and decided for myself what to get. I asked for extra meat for the Banh Mi which was a $1.50 more, but when I received my sandwich it looked like just a regular amount. I was not sure if the order was wrong but did not want to say anything as the service did not seem very hospitable. Granted this was thanksgiving day so maybe everyone just wanted to be done and leave. But I did not feel like the service was very friendly. Nice place if you want to just pick up food and leave.",

  "text": "I visited the opening day yesterday around 7pm and have been debating since then how many stars to give. I'll start with the one positive, this location is ideal for those who work west of City Hall. I'm not sure whether to cut this place slack or feel they should have done better but when we arrived they only had 4 (meat/fish) options. The line was long and overall it took us about an hour to get our food. The place was HOT! Like I'm standing in one spot sweating gross hot. I'm not sure if the AC was broken, couldn't go higher, too many people? It was just super uncomfortable. The employees looked tired and irritated which is understandable but still we're the customer and that left a bad taste in my mouth. Speaking of bad taste, the food...pretty gross honestly. I was forced to get chicken (that in itself is a crime, chicken on a poke bowl, yuck) which I paired with shrimp, white rice, mango, corn, cucumber, pickled ginger and for sauce the Sesame Ginger. The chicken and sauce were both bland in my opinion. My friend and I did the BOGO free and out total almost came to $15 and neither of us had anything extra so compared to other places this is def on the pricey side. Will I return, ehhh maybe in a few months when they sort out the kinks.",

We ordered a variety for us and some friends.\n\nPresentation wise, all the food looked good. We ordered pastrami sandwich. It was terrible! Overly salty and covered in lettuce. The rye bread was by far the best part. The turkey club was equally as bad. The turkey was beyond dry and the bacon wasn't very fresh. You could tell it was reheated, it was chewy but rock hard. The Italian hoagie flat out tasted funny. The meat was cut super thick and it was also very slimy. The hoagie lacked seasoning but it was covered in onions. Due to the taste and look of it we trashed it. The pierogis were easily forgettable. They were your typical stuff and not very good. They turkey special, again the turkey was dry. The thousand island was good but again something out of a jar, cole slaw was the same. All\nOf the sandwiches are large but that's not always good. I'd prefer quality over quantity but that's just me.  The cheesesteak egg rolls were the best part of our meal. They were actually edible.\n\nOverall it was a terrible experience and we would not return. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. It's really hard to mess up one sandwich, let alone 6.",

  "text": "I love the old school steak houses with the showmanship and art of flambé anything. My son and I decided after carefully going through other choices of steakhouses in the Reno area, Harrah's Steak House was the winner. \n\nWe get in the casino and looking for the directions to the steakhouse well it was behind us next to the keno area by the entrance door downstairs. Hmmm no sign but the on next tot he stairs lol. \n\nAnyway we get downstairs and you can already tell it's one of those old school steak houses with the servers in their tux's, flambé carts and dessert tables on display. I was getting excited and I knew I was getting something flambéd. Whatever it was.\n\n\nBefore we ordered, we were served our waters, bread basket, butter and amuse bouche. We started with a seafood platter for two. Which came with 2 halves shelled lobster tails, 4 Cajun shrimps, 2 oysters on the half shell, 4 pieces of seared Cajun ahi tuna all wet! Why they are all laid on cubed ice that is used for your drinks. Not crushed ice that is for seafood. And why the Cajun flavor on anything? I just want seafood no flavor just dipping sauces to choose from. Sure they gave me soy, cocktail sauce, seafood mustard like sauce, but what's worth the sweet pickle, wasabi, pickled ginger because I'm not putting that on the Cajun tuna, that's just not right. Aside from the Cajun seasoning, why was the shrimps over cooked, so rubbery. Don't order this! \n\nSecond course was stage lobster bisque, this was good. Not amazing but good. \n\nMains were shrimp scampi and New York med rare add. On Oscar topping. Here's the problem, the linguini was over cooked, the shrimps once again hard and rubbery which was over cooked. The steak more rare than med rare, the Oscar topping looked like bits of shredded crab leg meat in a weird sauce. It didn't look appetizing. So don't bother with the Oscar topping upgrade. Actually don't bother with the scampi either. \n\nFor dessert yes we kept going, I said I was going to get something flambéd! We ordered the banana fosters for two because that's the minimum which is $30 and profiteroles with hot fudge. The desserts were the WINNER!! I would come here just for the desserts! I wanted to try the cherries jubilee but my son like banana fosters uhg. \n\nWould I come here again sure for desserts. Yes they were busy and it seemed like they only really wanted to cater to the loud obnoxious drinking customers and the servers are working the tables for more tips. The other server I witnessed leave mid ordering from customer to say bye to his other customers that have apparently been regulars which was laughable but rude. Our server was at least trying to pay attention even though he is working the other table hard. I mean we probably spent more money than the other table of 4 but we weren't drinking and they were so he was pouring that wine. \n\nAt least now I won't wonder about this place, sometimes you just need to experience it yourself and give an honest review.",

I understand food is best eaten while dinning in/hot/fresh but the Beasty Betsy was the most awful burger I've ever had. I assumed sausage burgers were going to be a blend of ground sausage and ground beef, but they were 100% all sausage and it was horrible. I will take full responsibility for misinterpreting the menu, but there was barely any pulled pork and was assembled very poorly. The Sweet Chicken Club wrap couldn't have been any more bland. The mozzarella sticks were also over cooked. You couldn't even tell it was a wonton. Just a burnt wrapper. Would not recommend.",

The taste of the mole sauce was strong and peculiar, but that's absolutely fine, as taste is very subjective. But the whole entree looked very different from what the owner shows in the photo. Portion was the smallest I've had at any Mexican restaurant; I left hungry and had to eat a second lunch after that. For $13 (if I remember correctly) they gave me one very skinny chicken leg. The meat itself was so bland it tasted like it was boiled in plain water and the only taste came from the sauce. The rice was so-so. The beans were like those that came from a can, unlike in the photo. \nThe two stars are for the good chips and friendly service.",

  "text": "As a native Idahoan, I've eaten at the Stagecoach more times than I can count throughout my life and many times since it changed ownership a few years ago.  Last night a friend and I had dinner in the bar and found the food substandard by all measures and, for the prices we paid, I really should give this review 1 star and not 2.  We found the halibut chunks and \"famous\" Stagecoach shrimp to be lukewarm, the breading an odd flavor that did not taste at all what we'd experienced dozens of times before. The accompanying tarter sauce was room temp and had a glossy gelatinous appearance and the sour cream was mixed with artificial bacon bits and tiny green flecks (chives, maybe?)  Upon request, I did receive plain sour cream and it arrived at the table cold and fresh and the sourdough rolls are delicious (thus the second star). Our waiter lacked all personality, but I don't expect to develop a relationship with the wait staff when I go out to eat, so that doesn't really reflect in my review.  We ate less than half our food and my friend took the rest home to her pets.  What a missed opportunity for this new ownership.  The Stagecoach is an iconic Boise restaurant with a loyal following.  Their bar regulars can't keep it afloat if  they don't maintain some effort toward quality of food and service.   They certainly lost our business.",

  "text": "So it's been a few weeks since my visit to this medical clinic and as medical clinics go, they serve a purpose. For some, the location provides a needed place to go for their health care due to transportation limitations. For others, which category I think I personally fall into, its more than just location. Being able to get an appointment when I need it is a must, the friendliness of the staff is a requirement and most importantly, the bedside manner of the physician must meet my personal standards.\n\nMost of the criteria was met by Sanitas but my examination by Dr. G. Figueredo was less than stellar. Hospitals and clinics are expected to have a 'cold, clinical' feeling to them but the doctor, in my opinion, has to have a pulse. Healthcare is a serious business but does that mean that to be a doctor you must be stern, rigid and humorless? That's the feeling I got from Dr. Figueredo. \n\nIt's a feeling that invited me to cancel my follow up appointments and continue my search for a permanent PCP (Primary Care Physician).\n\nThe place was immaculate as they all should be, very neat and up-to-date looking. The support staff was friendly and knowledgeable BUT I couldn't get past the sternness of the doctor. I try to make serious situations less serious with humor but I could break the scowl off of this doctor's face with a jack hammer. The photo on the website is a poor representation because I didn't feel cared for, important or that I mattered. Healthcare is a science yet analytics and algorithms must go out of the window when caring for a person.",

  "text": "Hi Yelp! This is a review that averages our three experiences here, thus far. For two people, dinner experiences only.\n\nAbout four months ago we decided to try this place. I love Greek and Mediterranean food and don't mind it even when it's American-ized. The staff was obviously new and getting used to working with each other. We dined in, and our simple gyro and falafel wraps took about 30 minutes.\nThe food was good and as expected, it was too long of a wait and all of the available tables were dirty.\n\nAbout one month ago, I joined the Lunatic Reward Program and placed an online order. The app told me the order would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I arrived precisely 30 minutes after placing (since I remember my first experience) and the order was just being finished up. They threw in a hummus app for free, which was nice. The food held up on the drive home and was tasty and the order was accurate upon unpacking.\n\nLast night, my husband wanted to dine in here. (LOL, not sure why?!) The Grill was SLAMMED to their credit, and the woman who I have observed seems to keep this operation going was nowhere to be found. (She appeared before we left, and was wearing a pink shirt.) Our cashier got our order wrong, my husband noticed, and I quickly returned to the busy register area to get it fixed. A woman in black (in management?) tried to re-input it, and was extremely flustered. I informed her the receipt was correct, except for the type of wrap. She still put in the wrong side. It took 45 minutes for our two, simple wraps to come out. They came out at different times so I had to hang out near the reg to beg for my food. No one apologized or offered anything for the issues. Two groups that ordered after us received their food before us. My food was fine/cooked and my husband's exact same order was cold to the touch.\n\nI realized, during this long stay, that the online/phone orders are churned out very quickly. So, that must be who Luna caters to. They need a better Manager/District Manager that can help them figure out how to pace in-house and pick-up orders. Management should be empowered to fix their mistakes. \n\nI'm not sure that we will return. We were supposed to get a big to-go order for a dozen or so people for two events in the next few months and I am definitely looking for another option at this point.",

Coffee isn't half as good, service is lacking, menu isn't as vegan friendly, music isn't played regularly (which is weird because the store came with an awesome vintage jukebox from prior owners) and the cleanliness leaves much to be desired.  Even the ceramic mugs have been replaced by disposable plastic capped paper cups (we did NOT order to-go either). This was the first time we'd been in since the shop switched owners and will not be returning.  The place lost its feel of being frequented and staffed by area locals and now feels like it's run by and for disinterested college students.

  "text": "Updated Review:\nI decided to give them another try, as some time has passed and again, we got home late from working all day and we were famished. Upon ordering a pizza, I ordered 12 hot wings and asked the lady placing my order to make sure they include a full container of blue cheese, and I told her about my last order. She assured me that it wouldn't happen again and they would include a full container of blue cheese. My boyfriend picked up the order, asking the man at the register if they included the blue cheese and he was told yes. Once he got into the car he checked the package only to find that they didn't include ANY blue cheese. He went back to the door, but it was locked. He knocked and the man at the register looked at him and ignored him. I called and asked to talk to a manager. The manager I spoke with is named Dari. I know this because he spelled it out for me.  I explained the issue including what happened with my previous order. The manager told me to hold on while he checked with the cooks.  The cooks told him they put it in the bag. ugh.  He told me to hold again and then told me he checked and they don't have any blue cheese at all, so he doesn't know why the cooks told him they did. I asked Dari what could be done about it. He told me that he doesn't know because they don't have any blue cheese to give me.  I responded \"you should know that in the food industry you can't allow items like that to run out.\" Dari got angry, though he still hadn't tried to fix the issue.  He told me he would give me half off the next time I ordered wings.  I said, \"This has happened to me 2x now and I've learned my lesson! The last time this happened they told me they would give me extra blue cheese with my next order to make up for it, even though it wouldn't actually do anything to fix the situation. I'm tired of this happening to me!\" He followed that up with, \"We'll give you extra blue cheese the next time you order.\"  FOR REAL. I simply cannot understand how this type of thing can happen repeatedly. I told Dari, \"I gave you my money.  I placed an order and explained that there was an issue the last time I ordered and I was assured it wouldn't happen.  I would NOT have ordered the wings if I had known you wouldn't be able to fulfill the order fully!  Is there another manager I can speak with, or maybe the owner?  Can you give me the email address or contact info for the owner so I can speak directly to him?\"  He started yelling and told me that he's not going to give me any info for the owner and if I want to talk to the owner I have to go through him.  He also included that he (Dari) is 50 years old and he shouldn't have to put up with me.  He told me that he just offered to give me wings for free the next time (which is NOT what he said) and that he can't help if they ran out of blue cheese.  He continued to yell while I stood there with the phone on speaker shocked at his attitude...  Then Dari hung up on me. All I wanted was sincere apology, sincere CARE for me as a customer.  This has happened to me twice now, and if I've been treated like this by the manager, then it has to be happening to others, as well.  \nAlso, the $2 credit was never applied.",

He told me it would take at minutes and I came back in twenty. He handed me my 30 wings and large fry. I checked the bag for the large ranch sauce that I paid for but was missing. There was only a small one, when I told the guy it was wrong he tried to give two more small ones. I explained that's not what I paid for and he became angry. He eventually gave me the right size but seemed angry. When I got home I found my wings slightly under cooked. I will not be back to this location. Also my lemon pepper wings barely had any flavoring it was like plain wings.",

  "text": "COCKROACHES!  This was our first time here, and we really looked forward to it.  Alas, it was a disaster, which had nothing to do with the food. That being said, we will NEVER go back. \n Sure, the food took a long time to come out, and one entree arrived about 15 minutes after the other, but we can deal with that.  But just after we finally got our food, there came a COCKROACH crawling up the wall next to our table!  We told the waiter and he took a napkin and squashed it.  Then he split, without the slightest apology. Despite that, we decided to suck it up and continue our meals. Not 1 minute later ANOTHER cockroach appeared, this time on one of the PLATES containing our food!  Needless to say, that was just too much. We all got up to leave, and I asked to see the manager. The workers that we told said the manager \"just left\". Our waiter was nowhere to be found, either. (I suspect they were one and the same guy.) One of the workers (a woman) said \"they (the cockroaches) come from upstairs\". So obviously this is an ongoing problem. We received not the slightest apology from anyone.  We will never return, of course.  And I will report them to the health department on Monday (today is Saturday).",

Already annoyed I walked in but was greeted by the really nice day at the desk. Getting to the room wasn't bad and pretty easy to follow with all the signs. Pretty cool history being it used to be an old coffee house. I get to my room, very dim lighting so it was horrible and the TV was crooked and wouldn't stay up being mounted on the wall you would expect it to stay up.... nope! The bed was seemingly comfortable looking at the snacks on top of the dresser there was no price list so you assume they're complementary...nope I didn't even touch anything. I was also handed the key for the mini bar which idk you would hand me a key, so everything in the mini bar is free? Lmao no... Woke up the next morning to leave and go to our REAL rental home turned on the shower.. WORST WATER PRESSURE EVER! Oh and our view looks like you can throw a body down into a pit and won't discover it until rigormortis sets in. The only thing that was really dope were the vintage accessories in the room I thought were very eclectic. I don't recommend this place there is a nicer hotel next door.",

Sounds like something you'd enjoy right? You'd think it would be! BUT the inconsistencies and unqualified staff make for a less than pleasurable experience.\n\nGranted they TRY to keep the menu fresh and exciting by switching SOME things around but it's always hit or miss. Never a guarantee even one thing will be the same, that goes for drinks and food. Call me bougie but when does a mule come in anything but a tin mug? \n\nAs for the staff, sometimes they're good and sometimes they're just plain terrible. Forgetting things or just not showing up at all. Hellooooo does this lil blue light thingy workkk?!!! \n\nAs recently as today, we had tix for a noon showing of Widows. We arrived to signs plastered on all the windows stating the theater was closed due to inclement weather. Uhhh excuse me but the streets were clear since late last night with no snow nor rain in the forecast today. Management should have advised their staff to be there, instead we were told only kitchen staff were there and they couldn't open without someone to work the box office. Major fail management! \n\nHonestly the one in collegeville isn't much better so I guess I'll just suck it up a little longer until something better comes along to replace this disappointment.\n\nIf I MUST say something nice it would be you can pretty much always find parking and that shopping center has some pretty decent stores lol",

  "text": "I went to this Sears store on May 29th, 2018, to purchase a futon. I was scheduled to have major foot surgery the following week. Stairs impossible for awhile, going to be on crutches for some time, hence why I needed a futon. Couches are okay for naps, but not ideal for sleeping on every single night for 4 + weeks. \n\nSo. I go to Sears. I go upstairs to the furniture department, and the woman tells me they don't have futons in store, but we can order one from this computer right over here for delivery to your house. So we go over to the computer. I put in all my information, we set up a delivery date. I pay for the futon with my card. I get a paper receipt. We set up a delivery for 6/6. Someone will call me Tuesday, 6/5, with an estimated time of delivery for the 6th. \n\nSo June 5th comes. No phone call from Sears. Maybe they got backed up. So the next day, Wednesday, the 6th, the date of delivery. Around 10 o'clock that morning I finally call Sears, as no one has yet called me with an estimated delivery time, and as it is the day before my surgery, I kinda have things to do, so I would like to know when they are coming. \n\nSo I call. And I am told, my futon was apparently damaged en route. When my futon arrives back at the warehouse, I will get my refund. I ask to speak to a manager. I'm told there is no one available but someone will call me back. I wait all day. No one calls me back. I called Sears at least 3 times over the course of that day, and talk to a different person each time. Each time I am assured I will get a refund within 3-5 days. The woman I spoke with during my last call to the  that night was very snippy with me on the phone. \n\nSo I have my surgery the following day, the 7th. I am now forced to crash at my boyfriends, as I have no futon at my parents house. The weekend passes, no refund. I call Customer Service mid-week. I am told they need to garner my information either via the receipt or the card the futon was purchased on. I give them my card information because I could not put my hands on the receipt at that moment. I give them my card number, they find the order. I am reassured I will receive a refund within the next 3 -5 days. \n\nA week passes, no refund. In the meanwhile, I find my receipt.\n\nOn Thursday, June 21st, my boyfriend and I go to the Sears where I placed the original order.  I have the paper receipt. So we go in; we stop at a customer service desk. A woman who looks to be about 110 years old is working. My boyfriend tries to explain the situation; she cuts him off and tells him because it was a piece of furniture, we must go upstairs to the furniture department. My boyfriend gestures to me and asks if perhaps an employee could just come downstairs instead, as you can see this girl is on crutches. The woman says no, we must go upstairs. \n\nSo we find an elevator and go upstairs; it is a ghost town and not at all busy. There are at least 4 employees wandering; certainly someone could have come down to deal with my boyfriend and I on the first floor so I wouldn't have had to have gone all the way upstairs. But no. So we go to the customer service desk. I explain what happened to the woman; I am clearly getting exasperated because she cuts me off and tells me to calm down. At this point, I get really pissed off. If this had been done right the first 8 times, I wouldn't be standing in front of you right now. I am on crutches in your barely air conditioned store, and have been promised over the course of the past 3 weeks by every Sears \"employee\" I spoke with that I would receive a refund for something I purchased and never received so don't tell me to effing calm down. I give them my receipt. They tell me they cannot refund my money, because even though I bought it in the store, it was purchased from a computer; therefore, it is considered an online purchase.They give me an 800 number to call. I breath deeply, and ask to speak to a manager. \n\nI speak to a manager. She disappears for awhile. She comes back, and tells me that my money will be refunded to me within a week. She apologizes for the inconvenience. \n\nA week has passed. No refund. Yesterday, my boyfriend calls Sears Customer Service. They tell me the money was refunded on the 25th. Today is the 29th. I call my bank this morning; they go into my account and tell me they do not see any kind of pending transactions from Sears. I will now be taking the next step to get my money back, which is going to be an ugly one. \n\nI will NEVER EVER even SET FOOT in a Sears store again. I have never dealt with such incompetence from a place of business in my life. The staff is incredibly rude. No wonder this place is going out of business.How hard is it to just refund a customers money ? Absolute BS. Maybe by the time my foot is healed I'll see my refund. If I could give this store 0 stars, i would, because that is what they deserve. SHAME ON YOU SEARS.",

Margarita certainly wasn't good, not worth buying but carpe diem. Then first taste of enchilada sauce was kind of Chef Boyardee, still I'm no expert, so we started lunch. Then the man in next booth collared an employee and loudly debated immigration politics. His opinions went on and on. There were no waiters around so eventually just moved ourselves to where it wasn't quite so overbearing and obnoxious. And even though he watched us move, the employee let this guy carry on at him awhile more. No one ever inquired why we moved or stopped eating. I finally asked for manager, and that was a waste of effort. He basically kept telling me \"the 4 things waiters weren't supposed to talk about\", not helpful from a customer point of view. And yes, we still paid full price for everything, same prices as the know-it-all guy. We'll never return to such an upsetting place and I hope others will beware.",

The last time I was here was primarily the service. I totally understand that when it's busy, service is going to be a little slow here. They don't have much staff. However, the couple of people on the floor would check on every table but ours. We only had a table of two. But, throughout our meal, literally every table was attended to but ours. No check up to see if our food was okay. No asks for refills on our drinks. It's one thing if this was a consistent thing for the other diners there, but that was not the case. Several tables which showed up way after us were attended to multiple times while we were sort of left in the dark. Working in food, I rarely ever complain about service, even when it's lackluster. I really liked Saigon, but the last few times here have left a bad impression on me. Unfortunately, I won't be frequenting here any more.

Beyond that, the $20 extraction was a rip- I sat home afterwards and continued the extraction myself, because she skipped half of my face. In hindsight, that was probably a good thing or I'd have more cuts. Too much product pushing and not enough care for my face. Also, the massage she gave during the facial was awful- Like being poked and yanked around, and pinched repeatedly by her fingernails. Kind of ruined the \"relaxation\" idea altogether. I skipped the complimentary wine because I just wanted to get out of there. Don't bother!!!",

  "text": "Definitely NOT sales savy people, which they admitted they dont usually get actual walk-in traffic.  Drove 56 miles to go look at a $17,000 bike they had advertised on Ebay. I had bought things from them in the past and have had reasonable experiences. Nothing to complain or brag about but have never actually been there personally until this occasion.\n     I called them ahead of time, at their request, so that they could \"have the bike available\". I walked in to ask to see the bike. They seemed a bit lost at this request. Finally they got a mechanic to come up front and show me back to their warehouse where he took about a minute and a half to flip some switches, talking at 100 miles an hour and then he started the motor for 30 seconds. At this point he asked me if I had any other questions and then proceeded to disappear behind closed doors. During his \"walk-through\" I was informed that they do not allow test rides(due to insurance restrictions), which I thought was odd (since Harley had just allowed me a test ride on a $24,000 bike, the day before). So, I was left in a warehouse to look at the bike. No one came out to follow-up or see if I was actually interested in purchasing the bike. I had to go searching around for someone.....you'd think that selling a $17,000 piece of equipment would get someone off their ass but apparently not. \n      Long story short, it looks like it was all a blessing in disguise. I purchased the bike from the local Harley dealer and got a Harley factory warranty (which included electronics). I may still purchase parts from American Classic Motors, from time to time, but would never recommend purchasing a motorcycle from them. \n********* On a side note: was informed from a local dealership, that ACM would not accept / purchase back one of their own bike builds, for half of what they sold it for, just a year later. Makes you wonder how much confidence they have in their own products. ************",

After making my down payment the salesman told me it would be ready next day because they needed to detail it and put new tires on the vehicle. Well I paid for it on a Monday while I didn't receive my car until late Thursday. The primary reasoning was waiting on \"parts\" and detailing, well the only thing I saw different about the car was tires. I was also charged for the Auto Butler interior and exterior protection service while as well for $250 interior and $250 exterior, so $500 altogether when I saw not even a penny put into the detailing. Including the ridiculous wait for the vehicle over something that they clearly didn't even do and I was charged for. This dealership clearly makes you feel welcome up front to sell the car but as soon as you put the money forth they kick you to the curb. Saying that safety and satisfaction is the biggest concern of a car dealership or any business for that matter, this dealership has failed terribly.",

However the food left much to be desired. I ordered the lobster bisque and I was not pleased at all. The lobster bisque was quite tasteless and the lobster with scant. I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to the soup to even be edible. I also ordered the shrimp scampi for my entrée and the shrimp had a very chemical taste not really sure I know how to explain that. My boyfriend also ordered the jumbo shrimp Alexander for his appetizer and shrimp tasted the exact same.

  "text": "Went to Florida Dental after finding them on Cigna website as an in network provider. After verifying our insurance and coverage we were charged a reasonable amount for the service that were provided. 2 weeks later we received a bill for an additional $160.00. To be paid immediately. After a call to the insurance company it turns out that the Dentist that they used that day was not in network and our Deductible changed from $50 to $250, because of the Dentist that was in the office on that day. Really. After talking to the billing department at Florida Dental I was informed that the patient should have done their due diligence and made sure that they requested an in network provider. I explaining to her that they (Florida Dental Service) were listed on Cigna's Website and we came to them and provided them with proof of insurance that they had to call and prequalify us for treatment and they were well aware of what was covered and what was not. She let me know assuming they would continue to give us in network treatment was my mistake. The print in their contract (you know the contract that you sign just wanting relief because your in pain)states that some of the providers that they use do not subscribe to ppo's and other insurance. I asked her if they felt any obligation to verbally tell any of their patients this she stated no its not office policy. THIS IS THE DAY MEDICAL PROFESSIONS HAVE BECOME A BUSINESS ONLY INTERESTED IN THE INTAKE OF MONEY AND NO LONGER ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELL BEING OF A PERSON.

Not marked well. \nOlder building, so had great character. Definitely could tell at some point in its lifetime it was a great hotel. Lobby was almost deserted. Restaurant that isn't used anymore. Front desk staff were friendly. Elevators small, but it's an old building. \nRoom was a nice size (king), clean, but bathroom was too tiny. When I pulled the lever for the shower I was afraid the spout was going to come out of the wall. \nParking was $25 in the back lot. Very over priced!! The lot is tiny, didn't have much space around the car. Had to pull out for my friend to get in the car because the car beside us was so close. \nPrice was reasonable.\nIn a part of downtown that definitely has more restaurants to visit. \nDid like the location.

This seems to be the selling point. \nWe placed our order and waited for the food to be prepared. The atmosphere is very casual with some TV's on the wall. I am not quite sure what the vibe is, but it felt kind of relaxed - sports bar'ish. The food did not take too long to come out.\n\nI ordered 3 different tacos to get a sample of the place. I ordered the Al Pastor, Korean BBQ and Barbacoa Brisket all on corn tortillas. I was very disappointed in the Al Pastor. The corn tortillas (double layered) were overwhelming and the ingredients were underwhelming. Half-way through I pulled off 1 corn tortilla so that I could taste the ingredients. The flavor was lacking and it was disappointing. I gave my wife a pineapple piece to taste and she agreed, it tasted like water. These were the pineapple tidbits you get from a can...a very cheap can with no flavor. So much for fresh ingredients. The highlight of my meal was the Barbacoa Brisket. There was a good amount of meat on it and that is where the flavor was. The Korean BBQ was similar to the Al Pastor, just lacking flavor. I was hoping to taste the different ingredients combining in my mouth, but it was overall pretty bland.\n\nMy wife got the beef bowl. The portion size was good, however she also said it was bland. She does not like spicy food, but she likes food with flavor...and here it was lacking.\n\nMost of the ingredients may be fresh (pineapple was definitely not and not sure about the corn tortillas), but they lack something to create a taste bud memory.",

While I had a good experience at the time it was only recently that I learned of the shady and dangerous practices of this store. I recently purchased a new vehicle and when my Mazda was being appraised for trade in value I was told the car had frame damage and would not be worth much. This came as a shock to me as this was never disclosed when I purchased my Mazda from royal auto group. The dealer that I was buying my new car at told me that it was dangerous to drive a frame damaged vehicle and asked if I had known about the damage previously. Since it was never disclosed I did not know about the issue. They pointed out how they could tell body work had been done to my Mazda and then they also produced an autocheck report showing that Royal auto group purchased my Mazda from the auction knowing it was frame damage as it was reported as a frame damaged vehicle at the auction. They knowingly sold me a dangerous and damaged car without disclosing this information to me and also provided a clean carfax report. I am extremely unhappy with this dealership and would highly recommend other shoppers look elsewhere. This turned out to be a horrible experience once I learned that I had been driving a damaged car for over 4 years. I am currently looking at what legal recourse may be available to me in order to have this dealership rectify this situation. I also lost thousands of dollars in value as my Mazda was worth far less in trade value with the frame damage. Please please please stay away from this dealership for your safety.",

I had the brisket sandwich and it was dry, tough, fatty and flavorless.  I could deal with cutting off the fat since it is brisket, if it was properly prepared.  The tots appeared to be baked which is ok but and they were dry as well.  The service was ok and the prices are reasonable if they improve the food.  I gave constructive feedback and hope it improves.  I would love to see them succeed as an eating establishment instead of just a bar.  They do need to install soundboards it was very loud.",

I had a decent meal at the Glenmorgan and every evening I enjoyed the company of colleagues in the bar.  The overall hotel is a bit a tired and in need of an update.  That is about all the good I can say about this hotel.\n\nOn my last evening there, I came to learn that my room was within a block of people who were there for a wedding reception.  By 1:00 a.m., I decided it was time to call the front desk so I could get some sleep.  I heard the hotel employee say that the people in Room 310 were complaining.  Great!  That's when the fun began.  \n\nThings quieted for a bit but quickly the party was on again.  More calls to front desk and people knocking on my door at 2:00 a.m. telling me they were there to sell me Girl Scout cookies.  It was a scary experience and I will never go back.\n\nDespite sharing my experience with senior management of the hotel, I have not received any sort of call or e.mail back.  Very disappointing at many levels.",

Ironically it was 9:15am and all of the flavored coffee dispensers were gone!!  \n\nThat's very disappointing as that is the only reason I walk all the way to the end of the east terminal to visit their location.  If all they are going to serve is regular black coffee, I can buy from coffee from Dunkin, Starbucks or Burger King, all of which are located in the middle of the terminal by the security check-ins.  \n\nI, like many others, do not like the \"flavor shots\" as the artificial sugar or oil that contains the flavor bothers our stomach, which is not a good thing when traveling/flying. \n\nManagement - Please reconsider your decision to stop serving flavored coffee or I will boycott your store every time I fly until you do.  I'm sure your are saving a few dollars a day by only brewing one type of coffee, but think about the lost business and the fact that the flavored coffee differentiated your business.",

It took almost an hour for them to seat us after being told it would take only 15 minutes. We waited outside, looking at all the open tables on the patio. When our table was ready, the hostess came up to us and said we'd be sat in just a minute, but our waiter was closing out another table. We continued to stand for another 20 minutes until we were finally seated. Our waiter didn't come to our table for like 15 minutes, and by the time she did arrive, we were ready to put in our whole order. When we told her that, she had to go grab a bigger sheet of paper, which then took another 15 minutes. The food was pretty good, but we had no water to go with it, because the only thing that the waiters seem to be good at is avoiding eye contact. I had to renew my parking twice. Service was terrible. And at the end, the receipt math was wrong. Two tacos for $3.50 and a side of (bad) rice and beans for $4 does not equal $15. Didn't even take the time to get it fixed because I didn't have 30 minutes more to spare. Unless you have half the day to waste here for lunch, I do not recommend Little Donkey.",

My room had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker, all in good working order. Heating/ac is ok but they only can send one or the other to the entire facility at a time, although there is individual controls in the rooms. So hopefully your body is set to the same thermostat as the management.  The exterior of the buildings  need some upkeep work. Mediocre continental breakfast, just coffee, cold cereal, frozen waffles, yogurt and toast and apples. No jam or peanut butter or any protein. The positive is that it close to the Meadowwood mall and all the surrounding shopping and dining places. Ask for downstairs inner courtyard where there is much less traffic noise. It's a OK place as long as the rate is below $60. Otherwise your money is better spent elsewhere.",

  "text": "Jamal messed up my hair sooo bad, he put multiple large balled patches throughout the entire back of my head & they looked like alopecia bald spots. As I was pointing out to him what he had done as I was still in his chair, he act like he couldn't comprehend anything all of the sudden & his wife abeena was rude & kept telling me in a nasty tone that  it's supposed to look like that as if I was some fool. And still charged me $30. Never in my life have I felt so disrespected by such unprofessionalism at a salon. I had to wear a wig for 4 weeks before another barber could fix it because I had to wait for the large bald patches to grow back in so new barber could be able to blend it in. Everyone who saw what Jamal did to my hair said it looks like a junkie did my hair. They said there is no way that someone sober did that to my hair & I must say that I agree with what everyone else's said, that it looks like someone was heavily on something recreational when they did that to my hair. Worse barber experience in my life & abeena is the most nastiest, rudest & unprofessional person that I've ever come across in the salon business. Not to mention that I am also a licensed beautician & have been doing hair for over 20 years. Will never recommend this salon to anyone.",

  "text": "I am not happy with the experience at The College School and certainly cannot recommend it. We supported this school in many ways, including through our firm serving as a sponsor of a school fundraiser and sending multiple teachers at the school on a trip to another country. Our kids also attended this school for almost three school years before the relationship ended. While running a school is certainly not easy, in my opinion, this school has a lot to learn in terms of professionalism, empathy, listening, communication and compassion for the children and the families. The College School talks about \"love\" in their PR video, but I personally didn't see this \"love\" in my families time of need. Additionally, a greater working knowledge of how to accommodate and adapt to children with various special needs would also go a long way toward improving the school in my opinion. In the 3rd grade classroom with Matt Diller, my view is that this is seriously lacking.",

I waited over 30 minutes to get in but I didn't mind considering this was supposed to be the BEST hot chicken in Nashville.\n\nI give the chicken itself a 2/5 because it was freshly made and hot but the flavor was terrible and it lacked juiciness. The coating itself on the chicken was spicy ( I got hot) but it tasted like someone poured Tajin on top of the chicken and called it 'hot'. \n\nThe sides were a 1/5 for me. Again, they were all hot and fresh but the French fries were too salty, the Mac n' cheese too 'bleh', and the baked beans too one- dimensional sweet. \n\nLast year when I was here I tried Fannie Mae's and that chicken was AMAZING: hot, juicy, and the outside crispness was a hot oil that, while it burned everything it touched, was absolutely mouth-watering. I'll be trying that again this year and, hopefully, it's still as terrific! \n\nI'll pass on Hattie B's from now on.",

I called last week because I needed a new top for my Hemnes dresser because the one i purchased in store was damaged. After staying on hold for 45 mins a woman picked up and dealt with my case. She provided me with a case number and explained that my top for my dresser would be on its way! I never got an email with a tracking number and have not heard back from Ikea. No word where my dresser top is, or if I will be receiving it. Now it has been weeks without my dresser for my bedroom and my clothes have been just sitting on the floor. Completely unacceptable. I am even typing this as I wait on hold for the third time trying to figure out the progress of my dresser. Everyone who answers keep throwing me around to different departments and have no idea why my shipment has not gone out yet. I have been on hold for about an hour and a half now. I am extremely disappointed I even wasted my time purchases furniture from you when I could have gone to target and had a completely different and Professional experience. I feel like I am being hassled and I still have not relieved the full product that I have purchased. This is not how you do business. This has been the worst waste of time for me.

I could be wrong, but I'd be surprised if most of their business comes from tourists and not returning locals. I asked every Uber/Lyft driver we had and they all said the same thing. Overrated. But...I had to try it out and see for myself. \n\nLuckily, we caught it at a good time, because honestly I'd be livid if I waited in line for this stuff. The chicken wasn't really anything to speak of. Popeyes spicy chicken is a better option in my opinion. \n\nWe got several spice levels of chicken. Now, as someone from the South who enjoys spicy foods and has a pretty high tolerance for spice, I was a bit surprised by the scale of spiciness. \"Hot\" should be hot but not knock your socks off hot. \"Damn hot\" should be a little on the make me sweat side. But if you think you can handle \"damn hot\" just know that spice level doesn't exactly convey how spicy that actually is. I don't see how anyone can eat that and actually enjoy their meal. It's more like a \"Man Vs Food\" spice level. The fact that there is another level above that is insane. \n\nI only tried a bit of the damn hot simply because all you can taste is the spice. I guess that's to cover the fact that the chicken meat is bland. The zero spice level chicken wasn't very good at all on the inside and the skin wasn't great at all.\n\nNow...my real issue with this place. Myself and 5 other people...some of whom did NOT have the \"damn hot\" and some who did...ALL spent the next day and a half on the toilet. Tore our stomachs apart. My girlfriend got the ZERO spice version and she was sick all day. \n\nLook...don't jump on this place because it's touristy. Ask around, other places serve better food. I'm not getting into that, but just do your research and try going  somewhere that doesn't survive by being a tourist trap. More like Hattie F minus.",

Gumbo consisted a couple tablespoons of reaux topped with a heaping scoop of rice. Pathetic. Salad was bagged salad topped with 3 grape tomatoes, two cucumber slices and an onion slice.

After I finished eating the check was already on my table. I then waited 23 minutes for them to take the check and process it. The only reason I ever cashed out was because the manager walked by and I flagged him down. Pathetic service and they weren't even busy. Very disappointed!",

  "text": "Good quality sushi, but all you can eat system was broken on recent visit.\n\nI have been to Sakana three times now.  The first two times were rewarding experiences with fresh tasting sushi, a good selection, and decent service.  \n\nMy most recent visit was a total disaster.  I think the restaurant was short staffed and couldn't keep up with the orders but didn't let the customers know what was happening.  We had to wait one entire hour for the first round of our all you can eat sushi order to come out.  Meanwhile, a neighboring table who ordered after us were getting sushi.  It appeared that all you can eat orders were being delayed so that a la carte orders could be made first.  The whole point of all you can eat sushi is that you can keep ordering, and they will keep bringing it in a timely manner.\n\nWe had to get up and leave because it was taking too long.  The staff were barely helpful about what was going on, but did agree in the end to not charge us for the all you can eat orders.   \n\nI am willing to chalk this up as a bad night with terrible management. I will update this review if I end up ever going to Sakana again.  However, it is completely unacceptable to make your customers wait one hour before receiving the first part of their order.  Please don't even offer all you can eat sushi if you won't fill the orders the customer is making in a timely fashion.",

  "text": "My husband just took our dog here for the first time and said that the staff was very friendly. Unfortunately his experience with Dr Ginex was not the best. She walked into the room and before greeting/ introducing herself, she exclaimed \"we've got an illegal dog here,\" as we were late to get her rabies shot. She flipped through our puppy's paperwork, and rudely noted how we have seen multiple vets as if that were a bad thing, even though we have been moving for the past several months. My husband told her we were having a baby this month and her response seemed cold hearted and judge-mental saying, \"oh a new puppy and a baby, lots of new things.\" She was good with our pup and treated her kindly. Just disappointed in how rude she was. If you are young and this is your first dog, I recommend you don't pick this vet, as she made my husband feel like he was a bad person/ dog owner. We won't be going back.",

However those 3 attributes wont fill up my stomach and make me happy. \n\nFor real bbq lovers this place is essentially glorified Sonny's. If you think Sonny's is real BBQ then you will love this place and you can stop reading now. \n\nFor those of you who love real bbq this place was a let down. Hardly any decent smoke flavors. The smoke rings on the meats were minimal. The sauces were nice but should only be a compliment to good meat. The brisket while tender was mediocre and borderline dry. The nice juicy look you expect out of brisket was not there. It looked like deli meat. \nTurkey I always enjoy trying. It's a boring bbq meat but for some reason I always try it. This wasn't half bad but nothing to write home about. The sausage flavor was good but the texture was mushy. \n\nThis place imo falls into the fast food bbq category alongside sonny's.",

I was standing and waiting for my drink while the barista served a drink without calling a name or anything about the drink.

As I grabbed the cup she snapped at me telling me it wasn't my drink. How was I suppose to know? I felt attacked and didn't know what to do. I saw the manager come out from the back and see her snapping at me and didn't do a single thing! Just let it happen. \n\nI will not be returning here and will be calling Starbucks to let them know what had happened.

Everyone was friendly though...when I saw them :)\n\nEdit in response to the owner's reply: I understand that the camera contradicts what I said, but I'm trying to convey what it felt like. Bottom line, I walked out of there feeling like I had about 3 necessary interactions about 25 minutes apart, and each one seemed unusually slow or peculiarly timed. There were two different waitpeople coming to the table, neither seemed to know what the other was doing. One waitperson asked me what I wanted to drink, disappeared for a while, then came back and asked me again as if we hadn't had the first conversation. And I don't mean \"I forgot what you said you wanted to drink\" -- I mean straight up repeated the entire conversation as if it had never happened.

We wanted our table reservation honored. \nThe hostess called over a steroid bouncer-type guy & he said \"Well, I guess you'll have to leave then.\" \nWe asked if the people at our reserved table could be relocated to the bar and bouncer said No.\nWe asked for the manager & the bouncer said he would call the police if we didn't leave right then. \nI stepped outside and called Seasons 52. They said \"Come right over. We'd be happy to have you.\"\n20 minutes later we were sipping cocktails at Seasons 52 and having a great night. \nThe food, I hear, is great at SP but the service is certainly lacking & the staff is beyond rude.

  "text": "My wife and I have eaten at 'Puckett's Grocery' in Franklin many times with great satisfaction with the food, the service, and the prices.  The only problem here is that, during lunch hours, there almost always is a brief wait for a table due to the popularity of the place!\n\n Recently, we decided to eat lunch at Puckett's Boat House for the first time, and we were very disappointed!  In fact, before going there, we were in a downtown business, where we asked the owner about the Boat House.  He told us that, although he had lived in Franklin for years, they never had eaten there because they never heard anything good about it!  We should have listened to him!!!\n\nThe food at the Boat House was merely so-so!  The gumbo was very good (the single bright point!), but everything else was mediocre (shrimp and grits hushpuppies, coconut shrimp, fries), and the french fries were so salty that they almost were inedible.  If the meal had been good, the prices still would have been too high for a lunch!  My wife and I had wanted to eat a good seafood meal, but we didn't get it, and our ticket totaled nearly $50!!  WAY too much for lunch consisting of one appetizer (that we split!), one cup (NOT each, just ONE!) of gumbo (NOT a bowl!), and one meal (that we split)!!!\n\nPerhaps one thing we should have noted was that, although we arrived at about 12:00 noon, there were very few tables with customers!  We should have run!!\n\nNext time in Franklin, we'll not get close to the Boat House (which should be sunk!) - and return to Puckett's Grocery for a great meal at a reasonable price!!!",

Then go thru the line some more and they scan your ticket. (Do not throw or delete your ticket bc it gets scanned one more time) you go thru the first one which took about 15 min, then the next one the line was alot longer and this is where you have to scan your ticket again. Another 15 min in and then you go to the next one. So not worth it at all. I can't believe this is one of the top in the nation. Again save your money.

  "text": "Lived at their Central State Mansion property for 5 months. I'll put in simply: living here is not worth the money. It's not a horrible place to live, but it has all the same problems of your typical apartment complex, at a much higher price point. For $690 a month, you get a 10' x 10' room with scuffed concrete floors, dorm furniture, and an A/C/heat unit that is always breaking. The \"cool, co-working, young professional\" image they try to market for this place is untrue; don't let them fool you. It's mostly college students and transient adults who only come out of their rooms to microwave something and dart back.\n\nThe Mansion's grounds are nice, but I wouldn't walk alone outside the grounds at night. The area is only about a 10 minute bike from White River State Park, which is nice, but there's no bike paths until you reach the park.\n\nThe apartment's amenities are nice, but have their downsides. The yoga room floods, half of the exercise machines in the gym are always broken, the pool was never cleaned often enough, the \"guest suite\" costs over $130 a night, and the pantry lockers often had bugs. The amenities that are good are bike storage (plenty, safe), laundry (washers & dryers on every floor), parking (free for residents & guests, always enough room), and the movie theater. The communal kitchens and bathrooms can get gross at times, but a cleaning service always comes and cleans them eventually, which is nice.\n\nIt is very clear that management cares more about this place as an event venue than as a place where people are living. (Surprise! The pool is closed and the lobby is trashed because there was a wedding in your backyard.) Maintenance is hit or miss as well. Sometimes I would request repairs and they would happen in a day, sometimes they would never address them at all and never tell me why. \n\nOne time I called the Emergency Maintenance phone line because a resident set off the fire alarm, and they didn't pick up and never called me back. It took Management over 12 hours to shut the alarm off. Residents slept outside it was so loud. They did apologize with a letter and a $50 credit towards rent, but the whole event was unsettling. How would you feel if you called emergency line and got voicemail? And if your management let your space be unlivable for 12 hours? \nBut it is simply not worth the money. \n\nFor a small room, sub-par amenities, careless management, and a dorm-like environment, you could just go live in any of the other apartment complexes that are more reasonably priced.",

Could have easily managed this by offering those guests another coffee at any of the many open tables in the other rooms of the restaurant. Our guests stood around out front while the staff dashed around trying to get the room ready.  Confusion resulted, the arrangement of tables was off, tables not set, and misunderstandings about serving the welcoming glasses of Prosecco to the guests all ensued. Some of the staff were very kind and tried their best to set things straight... others, not so much.",

  "text": "I've attended this event for the last 3 years but after this year, I probably won't be returning. Our visit was Monday, June 4th around 7:30pm to around 9pm.\n\nMy friend and I are in line and 2 straight couples are getting in line in front of us. When one of the males walked by me, you could smell the alcohol from him; like strong. As I watched him and his party purchase tickets and head into the event, the guys were drunk; blood shot eyes, the smell and having issues walking. I notified the staff in line (who were on their phones and only looked up when I said something) about the issue and I was told they were going to tell their manager. But I was in line for a while and never saw such action. \n\nThe biggest issue I had with this year is that, it is not a Chinese Lantern Festival without Chinese Lanterns. This year was just illuminated cloth colored animals. I mean were they going for a deep sea theme? And what was with the Game of Thrones tree? And a tarantula? And a dung beetle? The large shark was dripping some brown water from it's tail, no joke and people were walking right underneath it. I'm sorry this is not some \"light show\" in your friends backyard and that is what if felt like compared to even just last year. Please stop gentrifying (white washing and diluting) everything. It is bad enough how Chinatown is changing with all of its boutique looking generic restaurants.\n\nSecond issue, they allowed drinking everywhere. When in years past they had a \"beer garden\" area where people could drink. But this was just an awful decision on the event coordinator's part. People were noticeably drunk and even saw a staff member with full cup of beer sneaking off to behind the bathrooms. I'm not anti-alcohol but people don't know their limits so allowing them more and more events to drink at, how is that helping the situation, especially in front of their children? Events want money so allowing booze is the cheap, easy way to get it. But how many kids are left in the hands of their \"tipsy\" parent driving them home? People cant see past their own wants to understand the bigger picture. There were several females who were noticeably drunk and I was walked into at one point.\n\nThere was very little staff working this event and the staff that were there, were either at the front on their phones, or around the gates to make sure people didn't sneak in, on their phone. And at one point my friend and I smelled cannabis and he said it was one of the guards. I didn't see it so I don't know but I smelled it near them and no one else was around them.\n\nThe last thing, was the bathrooms by the beer garden (like 20ft away) smelled like fecal matter. It made me want to vomit. As we left, I spoke with the manager Wayne, who was in the ticket booth, and I told him everything I am stating here. He wanted me to identify the staff member drinking but I told him I didn't want to get involved. I did my part several times to get these people to pay attention to what was happening under their watch and no one cared to do anything. What bothers me the most is the children that were there...what if some over intoxicated person hurt one of them? It is a dark park with lots of little areas to hide. This is not a family friendly event at all.\n\nThis was definitely not like any of the other festivals from previous years and for the price we paid to deal with all of this and the staff not even caring? Yeah, I can give my money to other cause that deserves financial support. I didn't feel comfortable taking pictures of people (I don't want to show their faces) but I have uploaded a picture of 3 staff members not doing their job to add a little more credibility to my review. I don't give 1 stars out lightly if you look at my profile.",

She then came back, took my order, and went back to talking to the cook.  \n\nThe vast majority of the other patrons were over 60 (I am not).   They had The Violence by Rise Against blaring.

  "text": "My 21 year old daughter stayed here last November.  After a long day of travel she forgot to text to say she arrived OK.  She checked into this hotel giving all information and sign in etc.  Later on in the evening we tried to contact with her but she had fallen asleep in the hotel room and is a solid sleeper.\nWe called the hotel twice, 2 times, from two separate people and they said that SHE HAD NEVER CHECKED IN.   Our daughter was then officially missing, a young lady, in the most violent city in the US.  Another daughter was finally able to contact the \"missing one\" after way too long for anxious parents 1,500 miles away.  So we had found her.\nThere is no way (at least that I could find) to contact the hotel directly, via email or comment, to inform them of their illegal and dangerous lack of knowledge about who was checked into the hotel.  \nI sent a message to Holiday Inn corporate who, of course, said that the incident did not follow company policy for information and security.  They said they would refer our message to the Holiday Inn Convention center, St Louis and that I would hear back from them.\nNeither party has contacted me again.\nThis is inexcusable and illegal.\nYes, my daughter dropped the ball by not contacting us and not answering her cell phone, but this is just the kind of situation where the hotel can and should and is supposed to pick up the slack to close the communications loop.\nIf they ignore serious issues like this then it will certainly not get better.  This is not a safe place to stay.",

You would think that after standing outside for so long they would take your order with some kind of sense of urgency.  Nope.  Another 25 minutes as they leisurely operated with half a cash register.\n\nWhen we did finally sit, we had high expectations for the food.  It came promptly but they forgot our Bonuts.  Oh the Bonuts, supposedly the best thing not to be missed on the menu.  It was ok but didn't blow me away.\n\nThe real serious disappointment was the Princess chicken biscuit.  It was dry, tasteless and the chicken was stringy and hard to cut.  They must have made it a few hours earlier and had it sitting under a heat lamp.\n\nThe Bill Neal was the only thing I can honestly recommend.  Cheesy shrimp and grits with bacon and mushrooms.  It was tasty.  Would I have waited TWO HOURS for it?  No.\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Skip the ridiculous line and go elsewhere for brunch.",

  "text": "Not only my worst experience in New Orleans, but the worst restaurant experience of my life. \nI've said it before in some of my previous negative reviews, the food doesn't matter if the experience is terrible, e.g., I've given an IHop in Queens 5 stars before, but if I could, I would give Willie Mae's zero stars!\nFor starters, we waited an hour and a half in a humid 90 degree afternoon in the Louisiana sun, and no one even bothered to come outside and take our name for the guest list. But luckily when it was our turn in the line, they let us in. \nSo I keep my cool, mostly at the urging of my girlfriend. But then, the waitress that approaches us makes things even worse. Focusing her attention on the larger table of 8 that sat right before us, she throws the menus at our table without even saying 'Hello,' then tosses one pair of utensils on our table from across the room. \nBut okay, I take a deep breath for the thousandth time and keep my cool, even though at this point even my girlfriend -my better half- is as angry as I am. The waiter who approaches us was nice enough, so I'm thinking: maybe I'll tip after all.\nBut no, it gets worse all over again, I ask the runner/busser for another pair of utensils and two glasses of water, and he's literally WALKING AWAY from me while I'm talking to him, so I have to yell across the room, and he just nods. \nSo he comes around with our food, a pair of utensils, and then the water. UH OH!!! He drops my water right next to me on the table, shards of glass every where. Now I don't care, I've been a server, bartender, cook... I've made all these mistakes. I tell him it's okay, it happens, I've done it before. He cleans up, tossing his rag all over the place, and my girlfriend is worried that I might be eating glass, cuz it broke closer to my side, but I insist that it's ok. I suck it up, I start eating but my forearm is getting stabbed by shards of glass. A piece of glass gets lodged in my thumb as I grab the plate, so I ask the runner/busser to change my food please cuz I'm worried there's glass on my plate. And what does he do?! He brings me back THE SAME FOOD on a different sized plate. WHAT. THE. HELL??!!!!\nI kept trying to eat but I still feel more shards of glass in my forearms. \nIt takes a lot, I mean A LOT, to put me off, I have burns all over my arms from the kitchens I've worked in, and I've dealt with major assholes before, but this experience takes the cake. \nWhen I asked to speak to a manager, they didn't even bother, they just gave me the waiter who helped us in the beginning, and I don't even know if that was the head waiter, maybe they were too scared to give me the manager. \nCompletely disrespectful and rude! I wouldn't even come back for a free meal.",

The last time I was here, I spent exactly $1 for a container of yerba mate tea on clearance. Most of the store is full of kitschy home decorations that don't appeal to me; besides, my small condo is too cluttered already. I wouldn't make a special trip to shop here, but I can walk here from Sprouts, where I do my weekly grocery shopping. So I drop in now and then; sometimes I don't buy anything, but sometimes I find something I can use at a good price.",

  "text": "Absolutely horrible from the first moment we entered the door!! The first indicator of the poor quality should have been that there were very few people there at 8pm on a Saturday night. We were there on 05/26/18-first the service was the worst I have experienced in my life. The waitress approached our table after we had been seated for about 15 minutes. Then we got our drinks from someone else. Our waitress finally returned 20 minutes later to take our order. Finally 45 minutes later we got our food which was just as horrible. My oldest daughter ordered hot wings that were burnt-fear of not eating anything if she sent them back we just ate what we had been served. The manager was at the kitchen door and was fully aware of what was occurring in his restaurant so I figured there was no need to complain. I was very disappointed for my children because they had never had a Hard Rock experience and their first will be their last!",

  "text": "I contacted them on a Saturday around noon and asked if they still have a Jeep they have advertised online. They tell me they do and to come in for a test drive. When I arrived a few hours later, after searching both of their lots for over an hour, they tell me they no longer have the vehicle. They told me they sold it the day before. I get zero apologizes. Awful. They proceed to try and sell me other more expensive models that aren't even the color I asked for several times. They do not listen to what the customers want, they just try to sell the jeeps they can't move. Their pricing includes incentives that you most likely won't qualify for unless you're a disabled vet that received a mailer from them. They make sure they word their listing to think you're getting all of the incentives on top of the internet price. They don't even put an asterisk on the discounts. I spent several hours getting the runaround. I've been in Sales for over 20 years and I get the car salesman shtick but these guys we're shady as it gets. They had all three levels of their management come over and it got worse as it went up the ladder. I went to another dealer and bought a Jeep under an hour. They were upfront and honest and really honest (Carman Jeep, New Castle, DE). I received a nicer Jeep and actually got the price they advertised. Imagine that. Thanks, Cherry Hill Jeep for your crappy service! I would have never bought this better Jeep if you guys weren't so incompetent. Sales 101: Listen to your customers. If you don't, you lose their trust and then their business. Also, once you start lying about the sales price, you become the stereotype you try to avoid.",

It lacks flavor and usually leaves your plate covered in grease. Each suite comes with a huge industrial trash can to make sure your living room smells like trash 24/7. So whoever's idea that was, I thank you. You may be lucky enough to get a room with a brand new flat screen tv and new leather couch, or you may pick a room that has yet to be updated and has a smelly couch with an older, less modern television set. The carpeting in all the suites is old, stained, and in certain areas smelly. If you're looking for college housing, I warn you to please turn away from this place.

  "text": "I've had my fair share of flight delays and \"bad\" customer service.... but this is, by far, takes the cake as the worst airport/airline experience I have EVER had. I've always heard mixed (mostly negative) reviews from people, but my friends and I hoped to be one of the happier stories. Let's start right at the beginning at the time of booking. When I booked my flight, Spirit charged me $15 extra for my check-in luggage. The customer service representative was very helpful, which is the only reason why Spirit Airlines deserves, at most, a 1 star.\n\nWe were on a 5:30am flight from New Orleans (LA) to New York City (NY) with a stopover in Fort Lauderdale (FL). One hour after our scheduled takeoff, we had to evacuate the plane due to an unknown issue with the plane and no clear updates until the evacuation. \n\nConnecting flights had to get rescheduled with only ONE gate agent to assist the passengers, so we sat near our gate to let the people with earlier connecting flights get assisted first. Nearing 9:30am (4 hours after our scheduled departure), my friends and I got on line to change our connecting flight from Fort Lauderdale to New York. The line was just as long as it was when we first got off the plane, so we decided to head out to the main desk (where check-in bags get dropped off) for assistance since there were more staff around. The staff could not look like they disliked their job more than they did this day. There was no sense of urgency to take care of the passengers. One friend was told she could ONLY get a refund for this flight and was never offered the option to have her flight rescheduled until after she already signed for the refund. At that point, it was too late and she had to look for an entirely new flight home. My other friend and I got our flights rescheduled, but the process was a mess. We were told to wait 20 minutes to hear from the supervisor... but didn't hear anything until 3 hours later. Every time my friend asked for updates, she was just given an annoyed look. While she waited for updates on our new flights, I was told to get my bag from the baggage claim since the connecting flight was going to be on a different airline. For the 3 hours I waited, I was told a bunch of excuses as to why my bag wasn't on the carousel.\n\nWhen we finally heard updates on our flight, the Spirit staff member said we had to board IMMEDIATELY (as if there was no such thing as security) or else we'd miss the flight. After much frustration, I made sure the baggage claim attendant would have my bag sent directly to my house and ran to my friends. Luckily, I got through security quickly and was able to make it to the gate and on the plane. My friend almost missed the flight, but I explained the situation to the flight attendant and we were able to get her onboard.\n\nIn the end, I left New Orleans with only 1 friend and my carry-on. We got placed on different flights from Fort Lauderdale to New York, so we all made it to back at different times and at least 8 hours later than we were supposed to. Save yourself the headache and frustration. Book your flight with a more reliable airline. It'll be worth the money.",

After 3 trips to Zio's we've decided it's much more worth the trip to go back to the best cheese steaks around (even Geno's & Pat's Steaks can't compare to Apollo's).  \nZio's charges $10.00 per steak sandwich offering nothing but a few slices of steak and cheese.  The roll is very slim which cuts back even more of the quality of the sandwich.  If you've never tried Apollo's do yourself a BIG favor and you'll discover the BIG difference in quality and price.  Zio's is more interested in the fanciness of the packaging and the printed labels on the egg-carton box that's much more appealing than their product.",

  "text": "Do not trust this company. Communication was poor throughout my experience. Questionable charging/quoting practices. Not actually sure if they really did anything, or just took the money and sent me pictures of a disassembled drive.\n\nSent a solid state drive in that was no longer detected by BIOS. They asked for $1600 up front, then $100 after the repair was done. I was able to \"talk them down\" (although I think they just grossly over-quoted to make me think I was getting a good deal) to $800 up front.\n\nAfter I sent my drive in, they performed \"diagnostics\" and said there was a 90% data recovery chance. After some time, they said they had to perform more advanced methods and that this method (something about connecting the drive to some board they have) had an 80% chance of data recovery.\n\nI received zero updates over a period of a month. I had to keep asking for status updates. Once I finally got a response, it was an email with pictures of the drive taken apart, a vague description (PDF report) of what was done to the drive, and a \"Sorry, we couldn't do anything\".\n\nFollowing this, I asked for some sort of refund on good faith. In their agreement, there is a line stating that they can refund partial or whole amounts at their discretion. I thought since they did not actually do anything for me, this would be no problem at least getting something back (I was willing to take the new hard drive they would have sent with my recovered data and be ok). That was not the case. After being instructed to fill out a \"formal complaint\", I was told I would have a response in 5-14 business days. Nearly three weeks later, I emailed the person who sent me the link to the \"formal request\" for an update. 5 days later, I finally received a response. \n\nThe response essentially said \"We did what we were obligated to do\". No hope of any good faith with customers there.",

  "text": "I came here because I heard this was a great place. I have been reluctant to cut my hair with anyone other than my regular stylist but unfortunately I really needed a cut and she lives in Maryland. \nMy appointment started out good but I was not happy with the end result. My stylist was running behind so he was trying to finish the client before me while he worked on me. Towards the end of the cut, he had to finish the other client's hair so he rushed to finish mine. He then passed me off to the apprentice, after asking if she even knew how to diffuse hair. He did not even check to see if my cut was even all around before she began blowing it out. It was my first time getting my hair diffused so I'm not sure if she did a bad job or diffusing just doesn't work for my curl pattern because my hair looked awful. He tried to fix it after I gave my honest opinion but really made it worst. When I got home I notice that my hair was longer on one side than the other. \nI would've had a much better experience if my cut had not been so rushed. It also made me uncomfortable that he would ask the apprentice if she knew how to do something before telling her to do it on me. I specifically didn't choose to get my appointment done with an apprentice because I wanted someone who had experience, especially because I have curly hair. Everyone was very nice but because of my overall experience, I will not be choosing tribeca again.",

I am a consistent customer to the shop and no stranger to the parking at Lark. I came out of the coffee shop this evening as I always do and my car was towed. There is no lawful reason as to why this happened. As a student I am disgusted that this residential housing complex is partnering with local towing companies to make money off of students who are parking to study at the coffee shop. I have never given any company a one star rating on yelp and today I make the exception. The feeling of walking outside and my vehicle being gone from a parking lot that I park at weekly is disturbing. Students should not have to worry about this unjust practice. I called the tow company and I was told that I didn't have a residential parking permit. I don't have a residential parking permit because I am not a resident, but I am a paying customer of the shop and I have parked in that exact spot and parking garage weekly since the semester started.  Shady business and you all are profiting off of hard working college students. This company is a disgrace.",

I was going here for a business lunch when I walked in after 1 pm doing the week, there was a total of 5 tables in the main dining room. I asked for a table for two, they directed me to a corner table between two other tables against the wall. I kindly asked for another table as this would not accommodate us. The lady who I assume worked there said oh well you can take that one, the man behind the bar interjected no that's a four top. She then stated well you can just pull them apart. He told her no no I can't do that you can sit at the bar or in the corner otherwise, I can't accommodate you. Mind you there were like 5 or 6 tables still available in the main dining room, and no one at the bar. She walked off and I did too!!! I called later and asked for the general\nManger but I got the same guy. When I asked to speak with someone else, he said why? I responded because I need help and you are unable to do that. He responded well we are on the same page I can't help you and you can't help me and proceeded to hang up in my face.

  "text": "I've driven by Uzbekistan countless times and I was excited to finally try it out. So disappointing. It's amazing how much bad service can affect your meal. I came with my parents and my brother on a Sunday night and we walked in and were seated pretty quickly but promptly forgot about. Ten minutes passed before someone came by and brought empty glasses - no water. Another five minutes passed before a water pitcher was placed at the end of the table. \n\nTen more minutes go by and we are ready to walk out of the door in search of another restaurant when someone finally comes to take our orders. We asked for wine glasses for the wine we brought (its a BYO restaurant) and it took us asking three times to finally get some. \n\nThe food came quickly enough, and it's unfortunate because if it weren't for the bad service, I would probably have given this place 4 stars.",

  "text": "Very disappointing experience. I had high expectations going in here. Upon entering, the restaurant itself is very cramped and claustrophobic. After waiting over 20 minutes to get sat, with empty tables available, my party of 3 finally got a table right in front of the door, with foot traffic everywhere. Our server, Joeswell (not entirely sure if the spelling is correct), was not helpful at all, lacked personality, and that seemed to be the theme with the entire staff. Every employee seemed robotic and unnatural in the way they spoke to other guests as well. The only thing that was halfway decent was the lemonade. Would not recommend.",

When we working together they were displaying pictures one of our services with descriptions of other services we offer. When I called them out on it, it tooks WEEKS for them to fix it.\nI managed to get through the 6 months of our contract before canceling. However, the canceling process has been an absolutely nightmare. It took 4 calls just to get someone to agree to \"start the process\" and even longer to complete the process. This delay of course made them attempt to charge me for another month of service. They are a flat out bad company that offers terrible service with worse support.",

  "text": "We had been planning our visit to Adele's for a very long time. As admirers of Jonathan Waxman, we had always wanted to see if his represented restaurant lived up to his stellar reputation. \n\nOf course, you should order the chicken and potatoes for which he is famous. The potatoes were amazingly crisp outside, soft and creamy inside and loaded with balanced flavor.\n\nAll the times I've seen Mr. Waxman make the chicken on shows or at cooking events, there is a simple adornment of salt, pepper, lemon and herbs with the chicken. Then the herb topping I've always seen made with anchovies, capers, lemon juice seasoning - along with the herbs and olive oil. The plating has always shown a grilled lemon served along side the chicken. \n\nNot only was there no lemon served on the side, but I'd be hard to convince any capers and anchovies made it anywhere near the herbs used for the chicken topping, let alone seasoning. The green herb topping tasted like flat leaf parsley with olive oil. The taste was beyond bland and disappointing from what the list of ingredients should bring it to be.\n\nThe chicken itself was mealy in an overcooked style and seemed to have that odd texture brined chicken takes on, which is loathsome.\n\nThe bread and olives brought to the table was so good. We were sure the rest of the meal to follow would be everything we had built this adventure up to be. Sadly, not so much. \n\nService was impeccable and the attendant was able to see that in the gratuity. Service saved this from a one star rating.\n\nMaybe it was an off day on a not too busy Saturday but it wasn't their best day for sure.",

Tuscany café is convenient because it's local, serves a variety of food. the prices seem to be fair, the ambience is great, the service is friendly and it is has a relaxing decor vibe. But it just wasn't meant to be. After navigating the horrendous parking situation I was acknowledge and seated  immediately. My server was very nice although she did not give me her name but immediately bought a nice plate of homemade pastries that was very tasty. Of course the La Columbe coffee they severed was delicious. But it was downhill from there the pancakes they serve were like three biscuit frisbees, The bacon was thin sparse and almost translucent meaning mostly fat some cheap brand. The home fries look like a baked potato cut in chunks and thrown on a plate, The scramble eggs we're average nothing negative or positive there. Everything outside of the pancakes were cold, not room temperature, not lukewarm, cold!\n\nIn my estimation they take shortcuts and use inferior products the bacon served look like something purchased at a Save a Lot or Aldi's!\n\n5 for ambience Starbucks meets lounge decor\n1 for parking as it's the absolute worst\n4 for service, my server was very friendly and they were prompt \n1 for food and it was served cold and very small portions",

It was a favorite spot for after a little league game, and I always loved the free personal pan pizzas from the Book It program at school. Well, those days are LONG GONE. Decided to give it another shot for old times sake and boy has this franchise gone downhill! Delivery was at least a half-hour late. I could already see where this was going. When the pizza finally arrived the quality was just shit. The \"breadsticks\" consisted of one mass of over-seasoned bread, barely perforated and had to be ripped apart to get an actual stick. Bland, soggy crust. Minimal toppings and a boring sauce sealed the deal for me. Worst $25 I've spent in a long time. I mean, it REALLY sucked. There so many other pizza places out there that are so much better. Amazes me how this company is still in existence.",

Upon coming back in for our 2nd visit to actually purchase the mattress we really feel in love with, Charles was off so Eian, the store manager, helped us.  Wish seemed nice enough and walked us through everything and writting up the sale.  When we got to the part for the free delivery, my wife and I BOTH made it VERY clear that we wanted our delivery to happen on a SATURDAY.  Eian told us that we couldn't do this Saturday and we we would have to wait until the following week in order to get a SATURDAY delivery, so we said we could wait the couple of weeks and we PAID IN FULL for our mattress and \"NEEDED\" mattress cover.  Well we are ALMOST at our exciting Saturday when I get a call to let us know that we are actually set up for a FRIDAY delivery...ummm, my wife and I work full time and waited an extra week so we could have a SATURDAY delivery.  Well it turns out that they \"NEVER deliver to our area on Saturdays and we must have been mistaken because your delivery on your receipt shows for Friday the 23rd.\"  Ummm, I guess we should have looked at a calendar, but we took it for granted that when we asked FOR A SATURDAY that the STORE MANAGER would have given us a date for A SATURDAY, NOT A FRIDAY.  Anyway, after have a rather poor experience at another St. Louis mattress shop, Mattress Direct, and let our sales person Charles know AND the store manager Eian know, they STILL can't fess up to their mistake.  When I called and talked to Thad, the GENERAL MANAGER, he gave us options of: having it delivered on Friday  (told us to get a friend or family member to watch our house), pick it up ourselves at another location, OR he could have it delivered to us NEXT Saturday(hmmmm, he told us that they NEVER deliver to our area on Saturdays).  At which point I responded and told Thad that we would be happy to take delivery on Friday IF we could get someone to watch our house and we would like a set of Bamboo sheets as compensation....\"Yeah, I am not gonna do that, we aren't allowed to do that, and your ticket says delivery for Friday, soooo.\"  Evidently customer service is NOT something Slumberland, Eian, OR THAD are able to provide...do whatever it takes to get our money, but not do what it takes to take care of the customer...their corporate customer service is a joke too...",

When we yelled in the back eventually 2 people surfaced then about 3 more came from the back. A girl came out and said they were in a meeting. I said that no one has been out here and anyone could have come in and taken stuff. She said 'that's okay we have cameras.' I then said we'll you lost a couple of customers bc they walked out. She said \"yeah that's okay we don't care.\" She was very rude and assume she must have been the shift manager. I told her she is losing 2 more customers and we left and went to Zoup. Funny bc the people who left Jersey Mike's were in Zoup complaining how bad the service is which of course they love to hear.

I just bought 4 top of the line Michelin's for our Yukon before heading to Colorado for a ski trip. \n1 - We noticed before leaving that the tire pressure was dropping in one tire, then realized we didn't know which tire because they didn't sync the tire pressure on the car.  No problem, my wife brought it up there and they said they checked the tires, no leak, synced the pressure sensors then they locked her keys in the car.\n2- just before leaving again noticed air pressure dropping on the same tire, they checked again and couldn't find a leak\n3- dealt with the tire that continued to lose air while driving the mountains of Colorado, upon arriving home, Dobbs stated they would put a top tech on it...okay let's do this again.  Remember, brand new top of the line tires.  After checking the third time yesterday they said they again couldn't find anything \nI just went to the garage with a spray bottle containing soapy water, found a leak in the bead in 5 minutes.  How is that possible!?!?!\n- maybe they'll put their top tech on it tomorrow when I bring it back up there\nI almost forgot, on the last visit we asked for an oil change (got the top of the line synthetic), they didn't tighten the filter leaving a leak and drips in our garage, I went ahead and tightened it myself, not worth them touching it again.  I wish I could fix the tire myself.\n\nAs a follow up, they were apologetic and gave me two free oil changes which was a nice gesture.  Hopefully it is finally fixed.",
