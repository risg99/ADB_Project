The quinoa bowl was deliscious, just don't forget to add avocado. If you are lucky Mason will sing for you! Oh and this place has Matcha Green Tea and they know how to properly prepare a straight cup of matcha. A true blessing for matcha lovers.",

It's pretty much what you'd expect. Comparable to Long's. I might say that it's slightly BETTER (gasp!!!) because they seem to have a little more variety but it's not a pissing match.",

  "text": "They have two different menus for you to order from. One is chinese/ Japanese American styled restaurant and one is authentic Chinese food. The regular menu is the same as other restaurant, nothing special about it. The ramen is delicious and I would recommend the black garlic broth with BBQ pork. The egg drop soup is kind of plain and my first take out order egg drop soup actually tasted lightly sour like it's about to go bad. The wonton soup is plain too, but you can tell the wonton are made fresh, not the frozen kind from take out chinese restaurant. The authentic chinese menu are  very good. I like their garlic stirred fried veggies. I can say these menu items are not full of MSG, but lot of spice and soy sauce, sesame oil to make the flavor come out.",

  "text": "I visited this place for the first time tonight with two other couples. I did not particularly like having to pay $5.00 to \"valet\" park my car 20 feet from me. I was stopped when I arrived and told the price. I asked if I could park myself and was told \"no, no one parks themselves.\" I'm perfectly capable of parking my own car AND it cost me $5.00 to park it very close to where I was stopped. I don't agree with that. There's no need for forced valet parking. \n\nTo get to the positive-we were greeted by a friendly young lady when we arrived. We were seated quickly but we did have a reservation. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. The food dishes ordered at my table ranged from the burger to rabbit fettuccine, fried chicken, stew and meatloaf. Everyone said their meal was delicious. I would return for dinner other than the valet issue which may have me think twice.",

  "text": "Visited Voodoo Gumbo during our visit to Nashville since my husband loves Cajun cuisine which is not readily available in our area.  Drove about 1/2 hr from our hotel to the restaurant which was in a strip mall with TJ Maxx.  Since it was 3:00 in the afternoon the restaurant was empty.  We were instructed to order at the register, the food was freshly cooked &  brought to our table.  My husband had the seafood gumbo (his favorite) which he loved.  He also had the shrimp po'boy & I had the oyster po'boy with coleslaw.\nThere were so many oysters I had to eat 1/2 of them first in order to pick up the sandwich.  Both po'boys were excellent, crispy & \"melted in your mouth\" tender. The po'boys were filling but we had to have the beignets which were hot & delicious. We inquired if there was a Voodoo Gumbo up north but was told by William it was privately owned.   Hi to Joyce & DeAnna who were also friendly & welcoming! We will definitely come back our next visit to Nashville.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I went here based on a suggestion from a friend that used to live in New Orleans.  He claimed that the Po'Boys here are authentic.  Seeing as how I don't know what an authentic Po'Boy is supposed to taste like, I cannot compare.  That being said, I can rate the place based on its own merit of flavor.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice sit down place, this is not it.\nIf you are looking for a place to take a date, this is not it.\nIf you are looking for a quick light bite to eat, this is not it.\n\nIf you are looking for a flavor explosion in your mouth that can satisfy an army, you've come to the right place.\n\nThe decor is very dingy so don't expect anything high class here.  The food portions are not only large...but unlimited! (I'll get to this in a minute) The food quality is superb and the variety of things you get is excellent.\n\nIn a nutshell, how this place works is you go in and order a Po'Boy, there are only about 4 different options such as chicken and catfish.  Once you sit down, you get visited by someone from the staff that takes your order for Sides.  I do not recall how many sides there were, but it was around 10.  These sides are unlimited, once you finish you side, you can request more or try something new on the list.  While waiting for the Po'Boy to arrive we had some sides and were already starting to get full on those alone.  Here comes the Po'Boy...a sandwich big enough that the two of us could have shared.  MAN was it yummy.  We gorged ourselves on the food here to the point that the drive home felt very guilty :)\n\nI recommend coming here with an appetite and maybe a few friends.  \n\nGreat job papa Roux!",

The owners are really nice and the place is cool, but it's just not for us. We won't be back, the authentic Mexican places in glassboro and Washington Township are better choices.",

  "text": "I wouldn't say this is the best Sally's in the area, but it's literally like five minutes away from my house. It's a great place to pick up hairdye and knick knacks.\n\nThey offer a membership for 5 dollars that you will get much more in return. You get a membership pricing on certain items and some gifts on certain occasions when you spend a certain amount.\n\nThey have a website too for what you can not find in stores. The workers are usually helpful the times I went. The last time the girl offered assistance on picking up colors for my mom and I. I felt she was off on my mom's color a bit, but nothing I couldn't fix up.\n\nI love picking up haircare products from here, but do be careful. I feel some of the products might be a little too old. I had gone to Cali and picked up a bottle of styling product but left it in Cali when I left. So I went to the Sally's back home and picked up the same bottle but the product wasn't clear like the other one. It turned out to be a really nasty yellow color. I wasn't sure if the product was bad or if that's how it was suppose to be.\n\nSo I'm going to be a little more cautious picking up some of their generic brands. I do however love picking up their deep conditioning packets that are almost always on sale for .99cents. Great for if you're always dying your hair!\n\nThey have tons of products for your nails, hair to do extensions, accessories for hair, and appliances. You might get a good deal here than you would other places on appliances. So it doesn't hurt to check in to see if you can pick up something here than running to the nearest Utla.",

  "text": "This pharmacy is continually one of the worst I have ever been to in my life. I am now looking into how to report this pharmacy or escalate this to a higher authority. I am seriously doing my research on this because the staff at this Walgreens are the worst staff I have ever seen ANYWHERE. They all lack customer service skills or general skills for interacting with other human beings. I have only come here twice in my life and have had a horrific experience at this particular Walgreens not once but BOTH times I have ever been here. The pharmacist \"Fred\" is rude and disgusting and needs to be fired. He does not deserve to work here. He is the worst pharmacist I have ever come across and I'm quite surprised that he was even able to become a pharmacist with his atrocious treatment of customers. I came here because my normal Walgreens pharmacy is closed at this time (10:00 PM) and I needed a refill of a single-dose medication that my doctor told me I could have two of. I got the initial dose yesterday afternoon. I came back for the second dose tonight because the symptoms had been continually concerning. I was told by \"Fred\" the pharmacist that I have to wait 20 minutes for the medication. I came back around after more than 20 minutes and he looked at me like he had never seen me before and asked how he could help me. I stated that I had been here over 20 minutes ago and he said \"oh, right, I didn't even start working on it yet.\" He then takes all of my information all over again as if this is his first time seeing me. He looks into getting me the medication and comes back and tells me that I am not able to get it today because I have to wait 24 hours from the last time I got the medication to be able to get it again. I explained to him that I had gotten it over 24 hours ago (around 3:00 PM yesterday and it is now 10:30 PM). He said \"I don't mean to argue with you but...\" and the rest was nonsense. I literally got the medication over 24 hours ago and met the guidelines to have the prescription filled again and was told I could not get it. He told me to come back tomorrow morning. He wasted my time and when I mentioned this he did not seem apologetic about it. I called the pharmacy a little while after I got home to see how I could go about taking action, and when he picked up the phone, without even hearing me say a word, he said \"there are too many people here\" and put me on hold! Wow, this guy is among the trashiest of employees I have ever seen! I will definitely be looking into another 24/7 pharmacy because of my odd work hours, but in the meantime I will also be spreading the word to others not to go to this pharmacy and finding out how I can report these horrible pharmacy employees.",

The only sauce I think is above average is the newer buffalo sauce with a bit of sweetness. The sauce name escapes me. Half of my visits the wings were a little over cooked. The dining area has a cafeteria wanting to be a sports bar feel. I stopped in last March to watch a little of the NCAA tourney and they didn't even have it on their TVs.  \n\n2 stars for flavor. 2 stars for the dining room. 2 stars for value.\n\nUpdate: I have to bump this review up by 1 star. I stopped in for lunch yesterday because I was craving wings. I ate the honey buffalo wings again. This sauce is the one St Louis Wing Co desperately needed. A sauce that keeps you coming back for more. A balanced sauce with sweet, spicy, without too much acidity. Excellent sauce. \nI also had the rally squirrel sauce. I was very impressed. Carmel sauce and nuts on a chicken wing?  It works beautifully. Not too sweet Carmel sauce goes great with the crunchy exterior of the wings with a bit of saltiness. Well done.",

  "text": "I came upon the first review of UAHomes, and I was absolutely shocked. I lived in a UAHome for 3 years (2011-2014) while in grad school, and Sheila and Cy are THE BEST landlords I've ever had! Not only are they among the sweetest people I have ever met, they are also attentive, responsive, responsible, and respectful landlords. I was always given at least 24 hour notice if Sheila or a worker was going to show up on my property, usually to assess whether the property needed routine maintenance. \n\nSheila knew I was always busy with school and didn't have the time or energy to keep up with the weeds that would grow in my yard after the monsoons, so she would periodically have a worker come pull my weeds for me (yes, I was always notified and grateful!). My refrigerator broke one summer, and I had a brand new sparkling (and bigger!) fridge within 24 hours! \n\nIt's very difficult to believe anyone would say such bad things about Sheila and Cy. I know many of their tenants like to move within the various homes that they own, so they can keep having awesome landlords. Living in Tucson and especially as a grad student, good landlords and great property are difficult to find. Sheila and Cy are a gem in the renter's market. I miss them and their wonderful property I rented for 3 years. Truly great memories. If I'm ever back in Tucson, Sheila will be first person I call to ask for an available home.",

No problem. However on Saturday night when we returned to our room we found out our room was directly above the ballroom. The music was extremely loud in our room. Now it was 9pm and most people would still be out, but I was in town to run my first marathon and wanted to try to sleep. We called the front desk and were told the music would be done at 10. Although we were told the day before they were full, they did offer to change rooms. Time wise I didn't think it would make sense to pack up and unpack if the music would be done in an hour. Well the music went on until after 10:30. I asked to have the manager call me on Monday-no call. There are many other options, will not be back to this one.

I have also had the chicken BLT, the fries, and all of the salads. Everything is very tasty. The pork nachos are a must.\n\nI love the selection of beers, and $10 flight nights on Mondays.\n\nI have gone for quizzo, stayed at the bar for flyers games, stayed for live music, as well as I love the fire pit outside.\n\nThe bartenders are extremely nice and helpful, even when busy. However, I am complaining about servers as hit or miss. I understand that you get busy. However, when the rest of my friends (group of 7) get their meals, and I get mine 20 minutes later, AFTER everyone else is pretty much done with his/her meal, AND I don't get an apology or anything... whatttttt? I understand that the place was busy, but I got the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend got the ribs. I get it. Ribs can take long. That was too long. And no apology...\n\nSorry city tap. I love you.

  "text": "Had to go the tourist route and get a cheese streak while in Philly. The hype is well deserved. I loved the sandwich and I'm not a cheese whiz fan but I didn't want to alter the meal. I was not disappointed at all. The food was good, service was quick, price was reasonable and I left there stuffed. I had a mushroom cheese steak and a bottle of water because it was a hot day. I'll try the fries next time because I plan to go back with no hesitation. The area was clean, parking is a challenge but if u get off the beaten path and park in the residential area and walk a block or two you'll be fine. Car was safe no issues or alarming concerns. I love the way both legendary restaurants are in the same area and they are both prosperous. A little friendly competition goes a long way and they have it down to an art. Just think they need to accept credit and debit cards in this day and age. The sandwich was $12 and that's a reasonable amount to use a card for your purchase.",

We placed and paid for our orders with the cashier, and a food runner brought our food out to our table, in about 10ish minutes. I ordered the Chicken bowl, which was pretty filling. The bowl itself wasn't the most flavorful, but I was able to spruce it up with their hot sauces, which they had quite a variety of at a sauce bar. I'd pop by here again when I'm in the area, if I'm craving tex mex, but I'll definitely explore other options first if I'm feeling adventurous.",

First we came a couple of weeks after Hurricane Isaac and they were clearly doing some work on one part of the restaurant.  However, their signage was not very good so we walked into the work area and were stumped for a little while on where to go.  Then once we found the right entrance we were greeted by a guy in a workout outfit (tshirt and shorts) which seemed pretty unprofessional.  The last disappointment was that there was a cockroach running around the dining room (as a midwesterner I am not accustomed to cockroaches and frankly am scared of them crawling over my sandaled feet).  On the positive side the food was very good and the waiter was particularly knowledgable.  The pace of the meal was a bit faster than I prefer, but we were on a schedule so it worked perfectly for us.  The atmosphere was really nice with lots of artwork on the walls.  I'd definitely not turn down an offer to return, but considering all the options in NOLA I won't ever seek out another visit.",

They showed up on time, cleaned up after themselves, and most importantly the job was done right. \n\nThe second experience was on New Years Day when our heater stopped kicking on. Tom came out (despite not installing our heater) and checked all the pressure sensors, cleans the flame sensor and other parts. Unfortunately it appears the problem is electronic it's the board. He referred us to a local Lennox dealer.  He was at my house for two hours, had to take apart half the heater to get to a poorly located flame sensor. And he refused to bill me or take any money for his time.  He also told me what the part should cost, and a ballpark of what I could expect for a bill and made a referral. \n\nThese guys are honest, care about their customers, and I'll refer them every chance I get.  Thank you Tom!",

I'm out the $100 deductible until they finish handling it with his insurance. \nIt's been almost 2 weeks after waiting for a response from Fast Eddy's. My car is still damaged and the lack of communication still stands.\nThankfully my awesome insurance will definitely be handling it with them. \nThe point of this review is to hopefully warn others of the potential for damage to your vehicle if it has any rock chips and fact that the owner won't be making the necessary repair process easy on you.",

Ok then, Corona me. \n\nThis was my first time in Nashville and there was a bowl game in town so not sure if crowds are always like this. The place was packed. The rooftop was an audio smorgasbord of music coming from every direction, so much so that it was impossible to actually focus on any one band so it felt more like noise. Sitting inside was a much better way to enjoy the music. \n\nI'll always be grateful to drink a beer on a patio. Wings were really good. California wrap was ok.

I ordered the jackfruit tacos with a side of avocado, which were served in lettuce cups and beautifully seasoned (you would never guess it's made from the smelliest fruit in the world) and very yummy. I also really appreciated the generous size of the avo side (1/2 the fruit) when you normally only get a couple slices at other places. BF had the potato latkes with a side of poached egg and also really enjoyed it. We're both meat eaters but I just wanted to try something new. The kombucha they had on that day was also really good (passion green tea, I believe) and even after we had declined dessert and paid the check, they presented us with a sample of their delicious baklava and soy ice cream, which was just the perfect finish to our meal! I've had baklava in Turkey and this was really amazing, so that should say something. Really worth trying this place!",

  "text": "This is a warning for any bridal party members who can't physically be present for fittings. My daughter was a bridesmaid in a wedding last month. Since we live out of state, my daughter had to give her measurements over the phone. When the dress arrived, it was too small. We took it to our local alterations shop to see if they could alter it, but there was not enough fabric. Angel Bridal would not refund the amount of the dress (about $300), despite the fact that my daughter had given correct measurements. Angel had not asked for the measurement across my daughter's back, just her bust and waist size, and though she has a very small waist and bust, she is a swimmer with a broad back, hence the dress would not zip due to that. Angel refused to refund any of the cost of the dress, even when I explained that we had given the correct measurements as asked by them. Given the fact that it was just before the wedding and my daughter did not have a bridesmaid dress, I found a similar dress online (one with a full refund policy, imagine that??!), and ordered that, but it meant that I ended up spending a total of $600 for my daughter to get a dress that didn't even match those of the other bridesmaids.  This policy of Angel Bridal seems completely unfair to out-of-state bridesmaids who are unable to be fitted in person. Essentially, if the dress doesn't fit, too bad - no refunds. What way is that to run a business?",

I will say, I was highly impressed with this place! I had the pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and green beans. Everything was absolutely perfect! The selection of sauces was great and the portions were huge! This was a great place for families. I thought it was nice that they play the national anthem at noon every day. The service was friendly (typical order then sit down style BBQ). Parking lot was accommodating. I cannot wait to go back!",

Irrespective of the reasons for the inmates having been imprisoned, there were two rather poignant things:  a tiny synagogue (one of the very few prison synagogues) which was built & maintained by volunteers in Philadelphia, and a framed prison newsletter article beautifully written by an inmate about the long-time prison doctor (who was originally there for many years on a voluntary basis).",

  "text": "Oh look, another \"I hate Comcast\" post.\n\nSeriously, wtf Comcast? \n\nI moved from NJ where I've had Comcast for several years. Since I was moving to Philly and that's a different state, I had to close my NJ account and open one in Philly. Okay! \n\nBut wait! The people who used to live in my apartment ran up the bill and never paid it. Great. Now I have to prove I am not them. Excellent. That rep tells me to go to the office on Columbus Blvd with my lease. Okay! \n\nI wait in line for 45 mins with 30 other people who wanted to be anywhere but hanging out in the Comcast line. I get up there, explain my story, hand over my lease and I am told \"Oh no we need your lease, ID, Social Security card, and a current utility bill from your old address\" I'm sorry, what? Since I don't normally carry my SS card and utility bills on me, I question why I was never told this and the heffer behind the glass says \"It's noted here that you were told to bring these items\" uh, no ? If i was I WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM YOU COW. So, off I go, annoyed and ticked off.\n\nI call Comcast the next day from work to drag some fax numbers out of em. I get 3, 2 dont work. WTF. Fine so I will go stand in line for 45 minutes AGAIN to deal with the heffer with mad cow disease behind the glass wall. Now I understand WHY there is a wall b/c I can only imagine how many people would chuck a cable box at their dumb heads. Anyway, I go, give the cow my info and Im told the security department will review and have a decision  in 5-10 business days. WHAT. I want internet NOW!\n\nSo I go home and send what I shall refer to as the EECB (executive email carpet bomb) to 80 Comcast Execs, asking why its so hard to continue to give them my business? Who calls me 20 mins later but Comcast to setup my account ? Score! Until I have to call back to tell them what equipment I wanted (had to double check with the roomate) and was told there were setup fees (yuck), and to get them ASAP (the next day) Id have to pay $30 for overnight shipping. Grr. Fine. Gimme the goods. So my roomate stays home alllll day the next day (Friday) waiting for our Comcast goodies. No show. So I call Comcast AGAIN to ask em wtf and oh my stuff didnt ship. YOU DONT SAY!!! And they \"think\" it will ship the next day. Oh. Awesome.\n\nSaturday rolls around and I get a call from Comcast who says they cant setup my account b/c they need the dl/ss/utility bill of the other person on the lease. What. The account is solely in my name, to which Im told, the other person on the lease could not pay and stick Comcast. Uh, hello? Im the ONLY person on the account. So after I go back and forth with this woman, shes not getting that Im not having this crap and Ive given em everything they asked for & now a few days later its not good enough? I snapped, to be honest and told her to find whoever had the authority to fix my problems to call me back. 10 minutes later I get a call that my account has been setup and they have a tech coming out to do the install on Sunday morning. Free of charge I ask ? Crickets. Uhhh, yea, free of charge.\n\nSo Mr. Comcast man comes out on time (yippeeeeee) and sets us all up, minus a router since he had none. That's ok, Ive got a spare around here somewhere. 1 DVR, 2 cable boxes, and 1 modem later, we can has Cable and Internets...1 week late.\n\nOh and on the following Thursday (one week after I was supposed to get overnight shipping) Guess what shows up at my door via UPS ? 1 DVR, 2 Cable boxes, 1 modem, and 1 router.  \n\nThe thought of going BACK to the Comcast office to hand this crap in makes me want to jump off the Ben Franklin.\n\nComcast is sooooo lucky I can't get FIOS in my building.",

But the last two times we made the mistake of asking for something more...once we asked for the deluxe service and found that the time spent on our truck was exactly the same as every other car in the place. Nothing was done extra.\n\nThis time we had a large problem with tree sap on the truck, so the attendant suggested that nothing but a hand wash would take care of that. So paid the $55 and waited an hour. The results were probably worse than just the basic wash. Mud was left under the doors and there were still bug splats above the windshield. More importantly, they removed 80% of the sap drops. So you know they can remove them...they just gave up on it. \n\nIt's time for a new wash place....",

That's a pretty high bar of expectation to set, but wooooow... yeah, I loved it. \n\nJoe's is located right on main street in Carmel, so you can't miss it. Stop in for a wide variety of spices, sauce, frozen meals, wine, sandwiches -- and obviously, meat. \n\nFor lunch I've opted for the BLT twice and the Cuban once. Both were delicious, but they really do work some magic on the BLT. It only takes about 5 minutes for them to make it, and the staff is very friendly. \n\nBe sure to grab a small bag of Broad Ripple Chip Co with your sandwich... and definitely, opt for the BLT.",

  "text": "I loved the original Cafe European and was so excited when they decided to open a new location after selling the previous. This location is more cafe style- which was actually perfect bc I would always stop to pick up lunch anyway. The owners are such lovely people. Everything is homemade and tastes absolutely delicious, and I was glad to see them keep some of my favorites from the old menu (like the cilantro chicken sandwich). They're so accommodating too. They have a regular menu and specials that always sound amazing- it's so hard to choose! My only qualm is that parking in that little plaza can get terrible so sometimes I don't stop just because of parking. It isn't their fault so I didn't knock off any rating and I know they have an agreement with the lot across the street, I'm just a snob and I don't want to cross Westshore in my heels ha- but it is disappointing sometimes nonetheless.",

  "text": "Ok - so I was born & raised in the area but have since moved to FL ... When I get back this way, I ALWAYS get my cheesesteak fix & usually attempt to try different merchants.  Especially avoiding Pat & Geno's ... \n\nLet me start at my arrival.  Upon entering the establishment I was glad to see most of the tables full at 3 pm -- good sign.  \n\nI was first in line to order ... And there were 2 gals present to assist w/ the order ... Surprisingly, I wasn't greeted or even acknowledged for 5 minutes!!!!!  The chick answered the Phone while I patiently waited ... Not even once making eye contact!!  That should've been the sign .... \n\nTwo (2) cheesesteaks ordered; 1 American wit & 1 Provo wit/out .... They charge an extra buck for the cheese on a cheesesteak (what?!?) ... Ended up getting one as a combo which included fries & a soft-drink ... Total was $22 bucks!!  \n\nWaited about 7 mins for my order.  Upon calling my number (same rude chick at the counter) I expressed my order was to go & politely asked for a bag ... To which her reply was, \"you'll have to wait a minute!\" Excuse the *^#¥ out of me ... But she did manage to hand me a bag this allowing me to bag my own food - how Customer Service is that?! \n\nNow on to the food review -- the sandwiches were average size.   Cheese was properly melted & distributed throughout ... The drip factor was present but the meat wasn't chopped up ... Ok, not a big deal ... But upon biting in the meat was a little chewy .... Flavor was mediocre but enough to fill the roll.  Onions had a decent flavor but that was about all I can say about that.  \n\nOverall, I would NOT go back.  There are many better places to give your money for a better quality experience & service.   Try Campos nearby for a much better experience from friendly to quality!   In fact, I've got a better local location in Orlando, FL from a Philly transplant who opened his shop called Brianto's!!  Well worth it as he uses best quality meat & flies in Amoroso rolls to add that authentic experience!",

I found that parking was difficult if not impossible  at the 12th street location. When I tried the spring garden club, the fellow next to me on the treadmill had a loud phone conversation and the staff did nothing to stop him. Getting out of contract  is a $50 charge and a thirty day notice totaling $100. All in all, I went twice and paid $550. If you think this club might be for you, try it for a month before making a long term commitment. They have a strong sales pitch and from what I found seemed more interested in emptying my bank account with different tiered clubs and fancy plans. I was definitely not their audience and have found decent gyms with better parking for a fraction of the prices they charge.",

  "text": "UPDATE: 7/10/2019\n\nToday I got a burger with American cheese, bacon, and extra onions. I've got to say, I have found my new favorite burger place and that goes for all of US as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what they put in it but it's got me coming back for more.\nJust look at the photo and you can see the pickles are perfectly sliced thin, crispy, they're not too thick, the onions are sliced perfect, tomatoes are sliced perfect and all laid out in the right order. The shredded lettuce is just enough to hold it all together and keep things from sliding off. The buns are toasted perfectly. All together every bite was great. I hate when you buy a meal like a burger and every other bite, or only three or four bites, are good. Every bite of this burger was balanced with everything. That's a hard thing to do.\nKeep up the good work!\n\nOk, I do not understand how this place receives 3.5 stars. \nStaff are amazingly friendly and professional. Food is fantastic. Easy in and out. Big diverse menu. Real quality meat. What else could you ask for?\nI have hade the classic cheesesteak with extra cheese about 7 times now. Always great. Hot, fresh, packed with yumminess.\nI tried the French Dip recently and it's now my absolute fav in Boise area. The AuJus is rich and piping hot. Good flavor, not watered down. \nI will share a \"mishap\" that happened yesterday though. \nI ordered this sandwich and got something that didn't even look close to what I had last time. Meat was fine, as usual, but the provolone cheese was grated and lumpy. WHAAAAAT?!?! No go. \nI took it up to the counter and explained politely that doesn't even look good. \nThey gasped exactly as I did then after apologizing hurriedly remade a new one. They explained why that happened, which usually I don't care about but because I really like this operation I appreciated, then brought me my delicious masterpiece. \nOk, maybe not masterpiece but it was fabulous. Juicy, cheesy, bread was so soft and lightly toasted it was as if it came out of the oven two mins prior. SO fresh. \nIncredible meal. \nDon't forget to get a frequent buyer card and always ask for your military discount (if applicable). They'll ask for proof so no fakeys or posers. \nGet ther\nEnjoy",

  "text": "This was my first wine bar after moving from Atlanta to St Pete. What makes this place so freakin awesomely versital is the layout and multiple seating options. It has a nice but small bar around the bartendar that seats about 10 people. It has another ledge and stool chairs that acts as a bar (but no bartender there). It has multiple tables and sitting areas to accomodate groups of people. And it has a couple of handsome sofas (and not something that looks like it wasa reject picked up on frat row) that allow for an intimate experience that great for a date where you could actually carry on a conversation. They even have a very small patio area too - only big enough for a small group though.\n\nThere are waiters assigned to the seating areas, so this is not one of those help-yourself to a wine spout on the wall establishments. They also have beer here if you want to be that way but no open bar. \n\nThe reason I chose this as the first wine bar was because it did look elegant and not like some hole in the wall but also b/c it was the only one open until Midnight on a Friday. Most of the other wine bars in the area close at 10pm! Wussies. 10pm is a pathetic closing hour for a wine bar on a Friday night.\n\n\nWhat also makes this place kinda cool and they seem to always have events or specials or something going on here. From the calendars I've seen they seem to consistently have a \"SUPER\" happy hour every last Friday of the month that last from 4pm to Midnight.\n\nMy only complaint was the music. No, the volume was fine; it was suicide-inducing theme that ran with every song selction. You know - sad Adel songs, Bruno Mars songs and the like. I'm like - are they purposely playing these depressing tunes to engage you to drown more of your sorrows in more wine?\n\nWe'd go back though. Hopefully Pandora or whatever they decide to play will be less depressing.",

(They also have a used book section that is quite limited - more mystery and romance books than straight up lit.) The books are organized just like the bookstore I used to grab books at when I was a high school student. I still would have bought a book anyway (some books that high school students are assigned are great books! Amerika by Kafka? Never read it. Should read it.), BUT they are cash only! At a book store!! Where a typical purchase is probably more than $10! But cash only. So I put my books back, apologized for not having cash, and walked out (probably never to return). If you're a high school student near Franklin or a parent of such a student, this store is probably great (so long as you have cash on you), but for regular readers/book lovers, it's not a great store. B&N in Cool Springs or Landmark Booksellers are probably better options.",

  "text": "I want to apologize as I begin this review because I know some people put some time and money into opening this restaurant, and they could stand to lose it just from the words I say.  But, every business, even restaurants, must offer a reasonable amount of merchantability with their product, and we did not find this here.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt in saying that we did show up later in the evening, but, the night we showed up, they were supposed to be open until 2:00 a.m.  They should have closed much earlier.\n\nTo start, the service was slow, slow, slow.  When we got there, there were just two other tables of people there, and we thought they were already finished - just sitting around talking.  They were not.  They were still waiting for their food.  One table had three, related couples sitting at it, and each couple received its food separately.  It was as if the place was preparing each and every order one by one.  They were.  I just found that kind of unusual since there were at least four people in the kitchen that we could see, and it seemed that they could do more to expedite the process.  \n\nWell, we finally got our food, and we were both wishing we hadn't.  I really don't know why I ate mine.  I guess I was just hoping it would get better.  It didn't.  The entire time I was eating it, I kept thinking two things.  The first was, \"Why didn't I go to Rouse's and get a can of Chun King?  It would have been better.\"  The second was that joke by Ron White when he talks about his wife's cooking and what happened when they tried to feed it to the dog.  They later found the dog in the corner of the kitchen licking his butt.  Ron White commented, \"He was probably trying to get the taste out of his mouth.\"  I was wishing I had that kind of flexibility.  The only time I ever had a worse meal in New Orleans was at the \"Moon Wok\" down the road on Dauphine.  That time, at least, the food tasted pretty good \"going down,\" but not so much coming back up.  The food at CreAsian didn't have that head start.  \n\nSo, what was wrong with it?  I had Vegetables with Tofu.  The vegetables may have been fresh, but I couldn't tell.  They were way overcooked.  Also, the cook used way too much oil.  It was pretty much a mess of oily, overcooked vegetables.  The Tofu wasn't too bad, and I don't really care for the \"soft\" tofu, cooked or otherwise, and I did like that they offered brown rice on the menu.  As for my wife, she had the eggplant.  She loves eggplant, but her's, too, was overcooked, and greasy.  To show just how greasy, they served the dish in a partitioned, \"to go,\" styrofoam container.  All of the entree was in the large partition.  The other two partitions were half filled with grease.  My wife kept having to pour grease into those extra partitions just to make her food edible.  It didn't work.  \n\nI feel real sorry for these people, and I am real sorry to have to write this review, but there are so many good places to eat in New Orleans, I don't want anyone else to waste their time or their lives spending time at this one without knowing about it ahead of time.  Now, if you like greasy food, and Chun King Chinese, you might like this place.  I, on the other hand, have had much better, and know what much better tastes like.  I would never be happy with the food we served no matter the price, and not matter the locale.",

  "text": "OK, I grabbed a seat at the sushi bar. it's self seating at opening at 11am. This is one of the few places where the bar seating is open. Here you don't have to put in that stupid little check off sheet to order or wait for a server to get to your table. Just tell the chef what you want. There were like 7 chefs on duty!  \n\nI will say the sushi is very good here and the pieces are a little smaller than average, but that's a good thing!, you should be able to eat each piece in one bite. The fish quality was good on all of the species that I tasted. I like nigiri better as you can get the taste of the actual fish and see the skill of the chef in making the cuts and forming the rice. The rice was good too, not pressed to hard and not falling apart either. \n\n Sitting at the bar you can make special requests easy and they'll do it for you. The service was fast enough that I wasn't waiting long for my next selection to appear in front of me. I gotta say this is probably the best sushi place I've found in Reno. The prices have gone up recently to $22 for lunch and I think $29 for dinner ... no difference in menu selections, just eating later for dinner will cost you more. I will return. not for the dinner price tho ...\n\nThis place is super popular, so if you don't want to wait, get here at or before 11am and wait by the door. When they open, just go in fast and grab a seat, as there is no hostess seating anybody at that time.",

Liquid ravioli with crab. Something with bacn foam on top. It just went on and on every 10 minutes and each was perfect.\nSalad with 5 lettuces' had a wonderful dressing and the Pork app. was wonderful. \nPoached lobster was as good as anywhere and the lobster bisque in a small cup was the best ever. Not thick like most, but more of a hearty type broth. Hard to describe, but if it's on the menu, get it. The chicken was a type of bird from China that was on the small side, but pure white when you cut into it and had a wonderful taste.\nMy only complaint , and it's minor, was the choice of dessert. The donuts with dipping sauce were not on a par with the rest of the evenings food.\nThey were a little chewy , not light like I thought they would be. The dipping sauces were good, but next time there were other desserts that I would try.\nService was attentive, parking is what you can find on the street, and at night the place can be a little hard to find, but just look the sign at the corner of 45th and Larchwood.\nIf people asked me for a BYO in downtown I would say this first and Fond second. If you're in the suburbs then Sycamore, or Lotus Farm to Table in Media.",

It is one of my favorite restaurants in Tampa and where I chose to have my birthday dinner there this year (it fell on a Sunday which would have been a problem in the past, but they are now open until 8 on Sundays).\n\nFor drinks, they have a full liquor bar of course. I've had their Bloody Mary before and it's fantastic. However, I'm a big craft beer fan and Datz always has a huge selection of good beers to choose from. And it's not always the same which is even better.\n\nFood is where Datz really shines. The menu is always changing and I always like to try something different when I come here, so while I can't recommend one specific dish, I can pretty much recommend everything. I have never been disappointed by anything I've ordered here. And as if I hadn't had enough to eat already on my birthday, they gave me a free cupcake for desert which was, of course, delicious!",

The front desk clerk was nice, but gave us a little attitude when we asked him to explain again the best way to get to our room (we were almost as far as you can be from the front desk; had to walk outside to another building, take one elevator up; walk down a hallway; then take another elevator up; then walk down a hallway).  When we ordered a drink from the bartender on New Year's Eve, she did not say a word, other than \"do you want to run a tab or pay now.\"  How about, hello, thank you, have a good night, Happy New Year.  We checked out via the tv, but had a question about the bill.  The person who answered the phone to answer our question was very nasty.  \n\nI do not like \"resorts\" where exercise room and/or spa are not in main building.

Sadly, the food is mediocre at best and for the price just not good. The wedge salad and the Mac and cheese are very good. The steak, oysters and baked potato no better than what you'd get at Outback. The spinach, or cheese with green stuff mixed in, is truly awful.  I'd say go to the bar for drinks but avoid the food.

The bar takes up a lot of room inside, but there's plenty of seating available. Mark and team is making some great brews.. I'm a big fan of the Coconut Porter and the Big Ed IPA (throwback to the days of ATA) is always a winner. I've heard they're currently making the third batch of this IPA that was originally supposed to be a limited release.\n\nNow, you could stop just with the beer and be quite happy, but if you're hungry, you owe it to yourself to take a look at the food menu and grab a bite to eat. The kitchen is in the basement and the chef puts out some killer grub. Nope, no simple fried bar food here. Instead, you can get a great salad or a sandwich or even an entree that will go great with whatever you're drinking. \n\nI'm keeping this place on my radar..

The place was deserted and yet they still took about 20 minutes to make two egg wraps, one smoothie, and sweet potato hash. Totally unacceptable! No sense of urgency and overall, the staff seemed like they had no idea what they were doing. No greeting when I arrived and no apology when they took forever to make my order, looking like bewildered, incompetent idiots the whole time.

  "text": "Wow.  I cannot believe it took me so long to find this place. Body Tech massage is a little therapeutic massage studio on Edmonton's South side located in a little strip mall. Walking in you already start to feel relaxed with their calming decor and comfy waiting room. The reception lady was super friendly and made you feel at ease. \n\nI did not have to wait long before my 30 minute massage with Janna. After a quick chat about problem areas she went to work on my chronically sore back and neck. It was amazing. She really targeted my painful areas without sending me crying which I find happens normally in my massages. The pressure was perfect and I could just feel my muscles melting.\n\nMy neck had the most pain and when she found the spots that were causing me all he trouble she did some trigger point stuff and I could literally feel the muscle just submit to her magic. I really left that appointment feeling more relaxed and euphoric than I had in a very long time. My head actually sat where it was supposed to as a bonus!\n\nAmazing massage place that really can help you out even if you only have a half hour for an appointment. I cannot wait for my next appointment!",

It's a shame because they are so expensive and would like to at least receive consistent quality. A young girl clearly in training made my smoothie. It ended up being chunky and tasting only like coconut water. All for 9$!! I don't blame her though. Two girls who looked like they were supposed to be training her were standing in the back on their phones. One even came out and leaned on the counter scrolling through her phone. Sadly this has ruined all my good experiences at nektar and I don't think I will be back for a while.",

  "text": "Me and my wife stopped in for happy hour on Weds night @5:30. The place wasn't busy yet. We sat there for 20 mins before anyone came to our table. I ended up waiting 45 min to get a beer. The first beer I ordered  came after 15 mins of ordering it and it was flat. I took it up to the counter to let them know. The rude waitress told me to go sit down and they would pour me another beer. When I told her that I thought ther must be an issue with the keg. She repeated harshly for me to take a seat and they would pour me another of the same beer . I then went and found our actual waitress and told her I wanted a different beer. The other waitress came over and told her to pour me another of the same beer . Again telling me to go sit . We got our food and I tried the Caesar salad. The salad was drowning in dressing that  was like watered down mayonnaise. There was something in a small condiment cup that looked and tasted like it had been scraped off of the bottom of the fridge. Finally after 45 mins my beer was delivered to me. We had ordered the \" special which was falafel plate .It  was deep fried to the point where it was hard to bite into. I opted not to eat any of the food . My wife was hungry so she nibbled at the gross food. I wanted to send it all back , pay for our drinks and leave but instead we left most of the food on our plates finished our drinks. Paid for the disgusting food and left a nice tip for the poor service. Not going back to this place . It's sad because we like the atmosphere and it has been fun taking friends from out of town there. Never again. Our actual waitress was nice and friendly and was juggling tables while the nasty waitress chatted with a table of friends , she also almost did a faceplant because of the inappropriate shoes she was wearing.",

They offer great service--maintenance requests are handled quickly and efficiently. They are easy to work with and flexible. Heather, the property manger, is a gem. You can have your packages delivered to the management office and they will drop them off at your door--no Amazon boxes left outside. There's free wifi and they don't gouge you on rent increases. They own buildings throughout University City, Center City, and other Philadelphia neighborhoods. If you want to move to another location of theirs, you can do so without breaking your lease and they just transfer your security deposit and last month's rent. They invest in the apartments and take good care of them. Highly recommended.",

The flavors in the dishes are distinct yet harmonious; the char on the rice noodles in the gravy chow fun come through and enhance the dish but do not overpower the delicate noodles and silky beef slices. The special greens (pea shoots when we went) were cooked perfectly, retaining their bright green color and a bit of crunch. \n\nWhen we first went, we were a little put off with the extra cost of rice and perhaps we ordered the wrong thing. But, after reading the rave reviews, we thought we'd give it another try, and I'm glad we did! Kwok's is a bit cozy, seating no more than 32. But, the food is definitely worth it!",

  "text": "With the poke bowl business becoming more abundant throughout Reno, it's difficult to pick a place! Bluefin stands out (at least out of the other poke bowl places I've been in) by having their regulars and large having an extra scoop of protein. For example, Poke King's regular is 3 scoops ($10.95), large - 5 scoops ($13.95). Whereas Bluefin offers 4 scoops for their regular ($11) and 6 scoops ($14) for their large! An extra scoop of seafood for the same price? Sure! My go-to sauce is always the spicy aioli with the unagi sauce. Their variety of toppings are for the most part pretty similar to other poke bowl joints. \n\nWe've come here to Bluefin on a multiple of occasions; location being the main reason for we live close by. The service is fast and efficient and most of the time we come here for a poke bowl on the go to enjoy at home. \n\nAlso, certain days they may have specials! This past Monday [6/25/18], they had a Unagi Bowl where unagi was the protein of choice with pre-set toppings. \n\nThe fish is good and reminds me of home. Coming from Hawaii, poke bowls are addicting and to have a couple of restaurants in Reno is great to have! It's no place like home, but it's pretty damn close. \nI'm no taste expert to what's fresh versus what is frozen, but as long as my taste buds don't taste anything too fishy then I give my seal of approval. \n\nWe'll always be back here whenever we have our poke bowl on-the-go cravings.",

  "text": "Wow! We have been wanting to try LuLou's for a number of years now, for a special occasion since it is so expensive...so we went for our anniversary this past Saturday. Wow, again...everything was excellent from the beautiful but trendy/hip/chic/mighty cool decor to the wait staff and most especially the food! Sezmu used to be my fav restaurant in Reno, but sadly they recently closed. 4th St. Bistro is really excellent, too, but something about this place....is making it my new fav. Too bad it is so expensive or I might drive down to \"Draino\" more often to eat here!  Since we had some martinis at Roxy (gotta love their happy hour) prior to dinner, we skipped wine with our meal here. For starters: I had the chile \"relleno\" (1/2 of a pasilla chile - at least I think it was a Pasilla - stuffed with tempura FL rock shrimp and served with a citrus salad), which was spicy and incredible tasting. I especially enjoyed the citrus flavors with the spice of the chile and the crunch of the shrimp! YUM! My husband had the Baked Lobster, served escargot-style. I tasted that, as well, and it was also very flavorful. For mains: I had the BBQ'd Quail with harissa sauce, a lovely spring succotash, and a truffle mac & cheese that was to die for - in fact my husband finished mine off! My husband had the veal tenderloin for his main dish, and while it, too, was wonderful, I was on a spicy kick that night - so I liked my spicy choices better!  Can't wait until next year's anniversary to return and try some new things on their ever-changing menu. They don't have a website or an online menu, but if you call them and ask them to fax you a menu, they will.",

A no-frills kind of place in the middle of the broadway strip, you will experiance the whole spectrum of Nashville; from the Woooo girls out on a bachelorette party, to the hungover honkeytonk cowboy about to start his next no pay gig around the corner, it is an event just walking in the door. \n\nIt's not the best BBQ in the world, but if you can stand the line it's a best bet in Nashville.",

The sign said \"Please wait to be seated\" so we waited five minutes for someone to come and give us a table. We then waited for fifteen minutes for someone to come to our table to take our order along with a drink order. We never did get any water. \n\nHe ordered a steak burger with thousand island dressing on it. I ordered chili Mac with a steak burger with mustard and onion.   Of course his burger had no dressing on it. My steak burger with onion was laughable.  It had one piece of onion on it. NO, NO!!  Not a slice of onion - one piece of onion. After waiting a while for our food, we were not about to complain about anything and have it taken away to get it fixed. \n\nAs we paid our bill at the counter, we both looked at the floor behind it and it was horrid. French fries and trash all over the floor. I'm amazed no worker slipped and fell. \n\nWould I come back here?  No, I'll go the extra miles to the one on Hampton Avenue. I won't catch you on the flip side here.",

  "text": "So how do you tell the story of a building that houses multiple venues for todays varied performers, performances and audiences, that was originally constructed over 100 years ago?\n\nIn my best Elmer Fudd, verwyyyy carefuwyyyy, hahahahahah! So pay attention and I'll tell you the story you've longed to hear.\n\nIt was 28 Feb, 1910 when the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine replete with Potentates, Nobles and Ladies, opened the state-of-the-art Murat Theater within the Murat Temple at the corner of E Michigan and N New Jersey streets.\n\nThe Indy Shriners named the ornate building, complete with Islamic, Arabic and Egyptian architecture, after Joachim Murat (Mur-ah), a general serving Napoleon in Italy and Egypt back in the day.\n\nThe original theater of those Potentates, Nobles and Ladies, the venue that so many of todays theater goers love to hate, has had the Indianapolis Symphony and Indianapolis Opera Company call its original 1,950 seats home over the years.\n\nBut wait say you, todays' web-o-matic says there are 2,600 seats in that space. S'up wit dat?!? So this is where the pissing and moaning starts!\n\nIn '95 the Indy Shriners saw income decreasing and refurbish costs skyrocketing so in an attempt to stop the madness, they struck a deal with Sunshine Promotions, todays Live Nation. A-HA!\n\nNow I wasn't there, but i imagine it could have gone something like this...\n\"Tell yous what...yous guys pony up da dough for da fixes and we's 'ill give yous a 99 year lease... AND yous can even jam in anudder 600 or so's chairs... AND charge des mooks anudder saw-buck just fur da prillage ta buys a ticket.  What say's yous?!?\n\nWell, maybe not like that but you get the picture.  Money was tight and this was a way to save a truly historic theater! Give and take and... get took so to speak.\n\nAs Pharaoh said in the days of Yule Brenner... So let it be written, so let it be done!\n\nAnd all that, brings us today, to reviews with \"bad sight lines, big heads in the way, narrow seats, no leg room, no slope, poor acoustics, bad signage, expensive booze, steep stairs to long pee lines, crowded intermissions, chaotic clustersf*@!\"(wow that IS harsh) and finally...neanderthal patrons who can't tell time or understand the words \"your, don't, electronic, turn, talk, off and device\" no matter how they are arranged and regardless of punctuation!?!\n\nAnd now for the the other side.  After 2 decades of supporting this venue and its myriad of shows and performances from Widespread Panic to Radio City Music Hall's Rockettes High Kick'en Christmas Extravaganza with live Camels to Little Feat post Lowell George, to Friday nights' Book of Mormon and all things in-between, you too can survive the FUBAR.\n\n1. Always GO EARLY to the Murat box office to buy your tickets.  You'd be surprised at how helpful the underpaid ticket person can be.\n2. Save your pennies (actually fives or tens would be better) and buy the best tixs you can afford for Broadway Touring shows. From an acoustic and visual standpoint shoot for something in the center section (orchestra) at least 15 rows back and no further back than EE under the balcony or on either side in the first 10 seats off the inside aisles.  Believe it or not the seats are in fact offset just a little in each row and yes there is a gentle slope to the stage almost the entire length of the theater on the main floor.\n3. The Balcony is also not a bad way to go. In the upper air, look for the first 15 rows with the same rules off to the sides as the main floor.\n4. Yes, seats are narrow, check your coat, and loose some weight lard butt.\n5. Yes, leg room is airline like. Deal with it and stand up when someone needs to get by...be a human being!\n6. Yes your first experience with this theater can be confusing, but if you arrive early, take your time, you should be able to figure it out.  There are signs and arrows, kinda like driving a car, not rocket science.\n7. Don't buy the overpriced watered down hootch and you won't have to piss and moan about pissing and moaning in long lines at intermission thus avoiding chaotic clusterf*@!(wow that IS harsh). Heck, I'm the poster boy for an AA ad and even i can go without for a couple hours.\n8. If, like me, you suffer from WMD (think about it, short and slow), all you can do is pray to the higher power of your choice that no NBA player taller than Muggsy Bogues sits in front of you, cause if you get two NFL Jeff Saturdays side by side, you ain't see'en much.  I don't care what venue you're in, you can just Listen to the Music.\n9. As for the Neanderthals, you know, i hate to say it but, i beleive it has gotten worse over the years.  The only thing you can do is call them on their inappropriate behavior from incessant talking to the ubiquitous cell phone fumbling.  Call em fast and call em often, just don't call em on your phone, no pun intended.\n10. Finally, when you go to the Murat, go in Steely Dan style, do it with your Fez on!",

They room heating/cooling system is on a timer that shuts off constantly so my room was never warm enough.\n\nI've been telling everyone Im staying at the NorthPole, feels like it!",

The salads are always fresh, bins are always full, the bread is fresh and warm, the soups are worth trying, although there are only a couple that I truly like.  The prepared Ceasar and Wonton Happiness are both very good.  The staff is friendly and always willing to help.  I would have given it 5 stars but the parking lot at dinner time is horrendous.  So difficult to get a spot and when we are in season...fuggetaboudit.  Considering the money this chain takes in, and the fact that this is is the best Sweet Tomatoes in the area, they should invest in redoing the parking lot before next snowbird season.",

The pancakes are the stars.  So many choices, went with the Georgia peach.  My advice, just get the pancakes. No need for eggs or sausage, you'll be full before you're done.\n\nThe pancakes are just right, not too heavy and plenty of flavor.  No need for syrup on these, they're plenty sweet as is.\n\nI had heard stories about long lines getting into the place.  I guess we were lucky because we walked right in.  It was about 1pm so that's probably a good time to go.",

Because they know what they want n dont need to think too hard or make a decision over small things like coffee and dont need to be too surprised as they know what to expect. Thats why chains typically do well. People dont always have the energy to figure out if a store is selling something they want when they are out shopping and get exhausted and need to fuel up their bodies. By the way...the Decaff was a tad bit sweet. I just needed something hot. Usually dont like that much sugar in my decaff.",

  "text": "Definitely the trendiest-looking Vietnamese restaurant I have ever dined in. You can tell it's not your usual pho spot when you walk in and there's no smell of fish sauce lingering around. \n\nMy group decided to let me choose my post-Broad Street Run brunch. I asked them how Le Viet's Cafe Sua Da is and it took no further discussion. After twenty minutes of circling the blocks around Le Viet, we found parking (thank Buddha, I was starving). The restaurant wasn't too busy for a Sunday during brunch hour. Worked out well for us and we were seated right away.\n\nSince I knew I was going to be gorging at some type of buffet in the evening as my BSR reward to myself, I opted for small items. I ordered Goi Cuon, Banh Xeo, and a Cafe Sua Da. Little did I know, the appetizers were not small at all. The Goi Cuon was stuffed with noodles, a little too much in my opinion. But the dipping sauce was delicious.\n\nThe size of the Banh Xeo was on a different level. It was probably the size of a cheesesteak! Unlike traditional restaurants that overfill the Vietnamese crepe with bean sprouts, this one had a lot of pork and shrimp, very tasty. Beware, the dish is served with a tremendous amount of vegetables that you will probably not finish.\n\nMy Vietnamese iced coffee finally arrived after my meal was almost finished. Not sure what took so long, but the server apologized. It was ready to drink in a plastic cup with a straw, no drip cup necessary.\n\nGood company and good food helped ease the soreness from running ten miles, until I had to get up. I had a good experience at Le Viet and will be back soon!",

Being as hungry as I was, and knowing I can't actually eat that much I wanted something I could easily heat up the next day as well. Answer- chicken parm with a side of angel hair pasta. Huge portion! Everything was cooked perfectly with a really nice tomato sauce. My friend got a Reuben and loved every bite.  \n\nThe menu was large with a copious amount of options. I was deciding between shrimp scampi, strip steak, blackened chicken wrap.. I was on the point of being hangry, but the chicken parm hit the spot.",

I know this is seafood in Nashville but it was literally the best food experience I had while visiting. \n\nMy friend and I arrived from a long flight from NY and had a couple cocktails at Skull's Raimnbow Room before heading over. Yet, Maci our waitress, sold me on this gin, blueberry, egg white cocktail, called Negative Space. Mind Blowing! It's like this girl could read my mind. I am a sucker for gin and egg white cocktail. I could not have been happier. \n\nThe restaurant itself felt modern, clean and spacious. I like to not be elbow to elbow when I am splurging on a meal. \n\nWe started with a dozen oysters. The oyster menu was perfect. It explained the flavor notes for each, of course some of the obscure ones were sold out. Our dinner was pretty late. I would say come as early as you can for the full menu. Also remember to check the boxes for mignonettesauce, horseradish, cocktail sauce and lemon. This was the best way to start the meal. \n\nThey suggested 4-5 plates to share. We ordered 4 after the oysters and it was a lot. But happy we got to try so many of the dishes. \n\nPoppy's Caviar - was a delicious and light dish \nOctopus salad - So good with the grapes, avocado and crunchy pepitas\nCrab Dip -  A really meaty one of the dishes, rich and comforting. Loved the cast iron skillet it was served in\nSmoked Trout - a lovely layering of flavors. With the potatoes it became a lot heavier too\n\nWe ended up taking some of the crab dip and smoked trout home and it made for the perfect morning chilled breakfast. \n\nThanks to our lovely waitress for helping us through the menu and making our experience so enjoyable.

Flashback to 90s is what the pink walls reminded me of. My chair was not comfortable. I'm tall and felt like my knees were at my chin. The lady giving me a pedicure was quiet for about the first half and then started asking questions I felt too personal (do you have kids, why don't you want kids, what do you do for work). And the worst part, my feet were still rough and dry when I left. Terrible.",

Started with so many delightful plates of appetizers- including the meatballs on toast, corn and crawfish bisque (which. Should NOT be missed) and Vincent brought a complimentary eggplant appetizer. Everything was on par with the best Italian food in Nola. The service was unrivaled and we were constantly met with pleasing waiters who were eager to fulfill our needs (the waiter had a 5 min conversation with our 11 year old about the state of the NBA). Overall all--- best family meal in New Orleans and we are regulars. DO NOT PASS UP THIS FANTASTIC ITALIAN RESTAURANT. thank you, Vincent and crew !!",

  "text": "Finally made the trip to the unsuspecting spot where Perennial resides. What a gem!  Based in the bottom of a refurbished Coke factory that now houses loft apartments, this place is awesome. As soon as we walked in, the bartenders gave us a friendly greeting and asked if it was our first time - indeed it was!  She then went through the menu and all the beer options available that day.  My husband and I both opted for a flight of beer to find out which one we liked best. My winner was Midnight Rambler, a dark full-bodied Belgian Stout. Mmmmm, mmmmm, good.\n\nTo pair with our beers we ordered the charcuterie plate and the pumpkin humus. Both were spectacular but the pumpkin humus blew my mind! I am a fan of all things pumpkin and it makes so much sense to use it in humus. It also came sprinkled with pomegranate seeds on top which gave each bite a tart, acidity to it. I am drooling right now just thinking about it. \n\nOur experience at Perennial could not have been any better. The beer, the food, the service all five star worthy. Oh and we got to chatting with a group of home brewers who traveled up from Memphis to try the place, very cool.   Got some great tips to use for our future home brews.  This place is a winner and we can't wait to go back to try and get our hands on some of their famous Abraxas beer next month!!",

Amy carefully, and with great surgical skill, had to cut the tail bit by bit until all the damage had been removed. The poor little guy was then lovingly rehabbed, before presenting him to me for adoption.\nMaybe another vet would not have dedicated so much personal time to save an abandoned mutt. All I know is that without the skill, compassion, and generosity Dr. Hoffman showed, I would not be the gloriously happy owner of \"V\" the coolest mutt in the world.\nDr. Hoffman was also the doctor who saved my cat, many years ago.

(Sponsored post, I believe)  I see a lot of reviews that rave about the cheesy grits, so I had high expectations!  Unfortunately, I was let down.  The price was $12.99. Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.  If we go back, I would like to try the fried green tomatoes.  That is IF we go back.",

  "text": "I came here for my 17th birthday with my two best friends and family. We stayed here for one night. We got two rooms which were connected through a lockable door. My outlook on the experience was that it was good, great with friends, but overall just good if I wasn't taking into account that my friends and family were with me. \n\nI'm not a very picky person, most things I just go with the flow with. However, having said that, there was definitely a few things I can talk about that was negative with the actual hotel rooms. For one, the sheets were awful. I am never picky about sheets but they were stiff and felt like paper. Another issue is the thin walls. We were able to hear conversations down the hall from people in the hallway as if our door was open. At one point I went over and checked because it sounded so crystal clear. My friends who used the shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner that came with the hotel room, said they all felt the same, just dyed different colors. Overall, the room experience isn't great. Luckily, you're not spending majority of your time there, or at least we weren't.\n\nNow, the views. This place is beautiful. I think everyone who has been here can attest and agree to one thing: this is a beautiful resort. The waterfalls, the roses, the greenery, the hanging and twinkling lights - it's all so very beautiful. \n\nAs far as options to eat in the resort, we went to a pizzeria place I can't quite remember the name of, but it was pretty good! We also had Carvel and Auntie Ann's for dessert and that all tasted splendid. For breakfast we ate at Auntie Ann's and Cinnabon. The lines were pretty bad but nothing like the marketplace line. They moved relatively fast, though, and the food was hot.\n\nWe spent majority of our time at the waterpark, which is huge and tons of fun. The rides are a-plenty and we swam for hours on end! Only complaint here is the lockers are, you guessed it, way too overpriced. The smallest locker, a \"medium\" is 12 dollars, and they don't accept coins. You're best just hiding your stuff like we did.\n\nIn summary, though, I believe this place is way too overpriced. I feel bad about how much my parents paid - don't get me wrong, I had a wonderful time because I always will when I'm with friends and family, but if I had come here alone I would have been immensely dissatisfied.",

I forgot to show the cashier my coupon and asked him if he could give us a free grilled cheese since it's buy one get one. He said no because the purchase already went through but told us we can use it next time. I thought okay that's fine we'll probably come back! \nWhen our grilled cheese with added bacon came out it was SUPER dry and TINY... there were about 2 pieces of dry bacon in there cut into tiny strips of four to fit the equally tiny sandwich. Tater tots were good, but not worth the price.\nI won't be going back to use that coupon :(",

The prices here are really reasonable and they have a good selection of stuff to order. \n\nIf the roasted meats hanging in the window are not something you are interested in you can also order some of the other stuff they prepare in the back. \n\nThe best thing about this restaurant is the service. While the waiters here may not have the smiling faces of waiters from most American restaurants, the speed is incredibly fast. For each of the times I went to Ting Wong's,  it takes the server usually 3-5 minutes after I place my order to bring me my food.

It's always full, no matter what night and expect a 15-30 minute wait, but you can go for a walk while waiting or have a drink.  \n\nThe food is awesome although I generally go for the a la carte items.  Their best in my opinion are:\n\nOysters Rockafeller - best I've had at any restaurant. Always get them. \nBeer boiled shrimp\nOyster Shooters\nBaked climbs\nCalamari - they are known for their calamari.\n\nThe staff is always great and usually cute girls. Prices are good and the view of the harbor is awesome. I suggest you ask to wait for an outside table for better views and a bit less crowding although you won't have a ton of elbow room wherever you sit. \n\nIt's defiitely on my top 5 restaurants I go to, especially when wanting to show a friend from out of town, a Santa Barbara experience.",

Met some friends for dinner last evening and were seated at a nice booth in the dining room. Ordered cocktails, which took much longer than expected to arrive. We ordered some of their small, shared plates after we ordered the drinks, and those arrived before the drinks showed up. \n\nWe ordered the breads and spreads, the burrata, two of the bloody beet salads, and a cheese plate to start. I highly recommend the bloody beet salad- it had a great yogurt sauce and was just really light and fresh. I could have done without some of the things on the breads and spreads platter- the chick pea fries were a little soggy, but there was an interesting kale fritter thing with a yogurt sauce that was very good. The burrata dish was very unique so props for thinking outside the box! I could have done with less of the toppings and more of the burrata itself. I think the proportions were a bit off. The bread it was served on was basic and forgettable, but the \"butternut peperonata\" that it was served with was delicious!\n\nI ordered the shrimp & grits, which were good, except that the proportions were off again. Massive grit cakes, and only 4 shrimp. The short ribs were delicious, very tender and, the veggies were great. A friend ordered the seared tuna served on a pesto risotto. The tuna itself was overcooked, but she said the risotto was excellent. The other three ordered sandwiches and raved about them. I think that might be the way to go. Everybody, except myself, had been there several times before, and were raving about the open faced greens sandwich. \n\nNot sure I'd go back, but now I'm very interested in trying out their Philly location to compare!",

After this interaction, I emailed Sadie requesting a refund of my daughter's summer camp tuition (my daughter had not yet attended the camp, so there were no services performed). Sadie apologized for the woman's behavior, who she explained had been dealing with some stress and drinking too much. However, Sadie refused to refund any part of the tuition. I explained I did not feel safe with my daughter attending a camp on a property where a woman acted like that in front of children. Sadie has continued to refuse any refund despite repeated requests. Thus, while the camp may have at one time provided a good experience for SB kids, the business practices of the organization are such that I would not recommend purchasing any camps or activities.",

I guess to be more expeditious while filling orders, the staff has pre-bagged those items.  Not a bad Idea, I guess, but for me I like to have my pig feet, turkey necks and corn sitting in the juicy juices, yeahhhhhh baby!!!!!! \n\nThis day in particular, this Cajun's restaurant's crawfish were about .50 cent cheaper that one of the others that I frequent & the line wasn't too long either.  As at other Cajun restaurants there's a line for cooked seafood & a line for the food that has to be prepared.\n\nAll in all this place was there for me in a time of crawfish-feining, I got my fix & i was good!!!!",

Their salad is usually awesome.,plus I love all the add Ins such as cheese, olives, hot peppers and more.\n\nThe staff is always great as well.\n\nOne day, we will have to try them for dinne\n\n  I'm going to update my review. I have been back several times since this first review and on occasion I find that the salad is just fair. Sometimes their great salad really pops with amazing flavor. Today it tasted very flat and it's felt or seemed that it had to been out for sometime, and I arrived upon the store opening. The pizza was good as always and I only eat the vegetarian pizza so that's all I can come in on. \n\nAs I love salads, I may not go back as often as I had been since the salads have been somewhat less enjoyable. \n\nAs always the staff is great.",

I would love to give it 5 stars but I can't recommend the prime rib or any steaks we have ordered as they are consistently super fatty and they use a very strong black pepper crust recipe. If that's what you like, you'll be in heaven! :) I order the wings or the pork lately and it's always delicious but brunch is where the party's at. Hoping the Brewery will open again soon, we always had a good time when bands or karaoke were happening!",

Mix and match friends!\nThey don't have octopus or crab as a protein choice. They do have crab salad as a topping. The proteins they give you are a good portion. We like our poke chunky so this place was good for that. Their fish isn't diced up fine and they didn't use the smallest scooper they could find.",

The crowd never really showed up but the service was still VERY slow because they could not keep enough chicken wings cooked.  We had to wait for 2 batches of wings to be cooked before being served but once we received the food it was all good.\n\nOne thing I noticed that I didn't like was the first server you encountered was eating food off the line which was not sanitary or healthy for customers.  From my table I could see her taking pieces of fish eating them ... this happened more than once.  She was obviously trying to hide it but not very well.  I don't think the management would allow this behavior but it happened anyway ... she also gave some food to the girl who was learning the register when she came to socialize during some down time",

However he was a little bitchy with me. I asked if the Dhal was soup-like (that's how it is in the NY places I have been too) so I could use it for dipping the Naan. IDK, but for some reason that ticked him off. Anyway he brought my out Dhal that was thick, so I spread it on the Naan. The he didn't offer us desert and gave us our check. I didn't feel like we were being kicked out though because we sat there for a long time before we got the check. Sooo to sum it up the food was excellent, but the service was a little lacking.",

When you got 10-18 people looking for a place to eat its amazing that this place is adaptable to accommodation.\n\nThis time I had a great pasta that was properly oiled and graced with proportionate amounts of tomatoes, herbs, and feta cheese that was just a great meal. \n\nWe also had those fried zucchini sticks with the mozzarella atop. but it was obviously from a prepared and refrigerated mix, since it melted far to slow. Hand grinding is usually thinner imparts some warmth and melts faster. That's how i know.\n\nThe drinks came out in good time, or waters were always filled, and the waitress was very nice even though we continue to invite our difficult friend. He makes for laughs and assures me that our hosts \"earn\" their keep. He's not mean, he is challenging. \n\nAnyways while the huge menu, and service are very good there are things that keep the restaurant from reaching the top echelon. Perhaps a higher end selection or more paired items. I think a menu revamp should be in order. Surprisingly this has a lot of  sub conscious behavioral affects on people.",

He made the entire process super easy and was a professional from start to finish.  The day we picked it up was quite wet and nasty and Ben suggested that I bring it back for its cleanup and detail on a better day.  I was impressed with his concern and even more impressed because none of the other dealerships talked about this kind of service being included with the purchase of their used vehicles.  We thought that only came with a  new car.  \n\nWe loved the fact that we only had to deal with him, and that we were not turned over to another person to finish the paperwork.   Bottom Line - Rivard Buick GMC and Ben Pugliesi treated my family great, and we got a tremendous deal in the process.  \n\nNothing negative to share.",

I ordered the Nashville chicken bone in hot chicken wings. They definitely weren't hot but seasoned well. They are served with pickles which is awesome and goes with the \"Nashville\" name.\nAs a table we also had the Coney Island poutine and a Meatzorilla pizza. \nPoutine was good but just like most stacked fries or nachos the top layer has all the toppings then you have a ton of naked friends/chips left.\nThe Roadstone Meatzorilla pizza was great! Loaded up with meat and cheese. I would recommend getting it \"well done\" if you like a crisper bite. Otherwise the pizza was great! \nAlso had a blood orange sour from their tap, Five foot freak. It was good but just seemed to be missing \"something\". \nMy only complaint is that they offer certain apps at $3.33 between certain hours. They have the list inside each menu. After our group finally agreed on a few apps the waiter came back as said \"I was just informed we aren't doing the discount on weekends\". There was no days listed on the app list only times. I'd recommend they remove the advertisement during the weekend or list the days that these items are offered. \nThe server did ask if we had a Sahm's card and explained what it was but never offered to sign any of us up even after we all said we were first timers ‍",

As soon as you walk in there's a whole section set up by women's bathing suits for summer fun including pool floaties, personal coolers, fiesta decor, and margarita fixings! \n\nIf you thought target stole all your money before, beware of this one!",

Lol) was Drago's.  He proclaimed they had the best charbroiled oysters, and he told no lies.  The piping hot oysters arrived at the table crusted with Parmesan cheese on top, and swimming in butter.  I grabbed a piece of French bread, gave my best somersault tuck, and dove in!  So rich and flavorful, just sublime.  The spinach dip was tasty as well, but the oysters are a must.",

The oil that came with the amuse bouche was not EVOO. Clear, flavorless oil. The bread was pretty good. If the pasta is home made mine was a few days old. The sauce with my veal appeared to use canned/jarred ingredients. Pizza was undercooked. No color on the crust or cheese. We'll give it a try again in a few months.",

How's that for going back in time.  \n\nWe ordered up a couple of specials and since they brew their own gin there the YS decided to try a martini.  It and the turkey sandwiches and soup/salad were all quite tasty and decent sized portions.\n\nThe service was good and the refills on the soda and water were right on track.  \n\nThis looks to be a fun place to hang later in the evening.

Fast and friendly service, great atmosphere, outdoor seating on the patio in the back and front, nice decor inside, and of course the food was delicious! We ordered specialty drinks Drunk Geisha and Summer Splash. The drinks were perfectly balanced with flavor and alcohol. We had the appetizer of Tam Yum Goon which was similar to crab rangoon but much better quality! And the sweet chili sauce that went with it was to die for. We each got Pho which is a broth with your choice of noodle and protein, bean sprouts, cilantro, spicy peppers, basil and seaweed. You got to add the ingredients  to it with as little or as much as you wanted. We left full and happy and with some leftovers. I highly recommend this place if you like Asian cuisine. We were also told there is live music on the weekends!",

  "text": "ATTENTION VETERANS do not support this dealership.  I drove over two hours to try and purchase a vehicle here and what they promised on the phone and what happened when I got to the dealership were two different things.   \n\nFirst they removed the window sticker from the car and tried to tell me the MSRP was different.  Secondly they claim to honor USAA certified car buying pricing and they flat out refused to honor the certificate that I presented them.  Finally, I tried to negotiate with them because we had driven so far and when they came back they made it look like they gave me a deeper discount but changed the price on the car again.  \n\nI found my experience there as a veteran insulting as they treated me like I was some kind of idiot.  The salesman even called the next day and asked if we had bought a car yet.  I told him no because we spent all evening driving back.  I told him I have never been treated so poorly and manipulated by a car dealer in my life.  He said he was sorry they couldn't earn our business.  Folks, they didn't try to earn my business.  They tried to rip off a disabled veteran and his family.  Stay away from this place.",

As others have mentioned, it's a bit of a Subway for pizza.. but with better toppings.  \n\nThe crust itself was good, but a bit on the chewy side.

  "text": "My girlfriend and I tried City Winery for a Griffin House show in mid-November one Wednesday night. Mostly we wanted to see the new concert behemoth of SoBro (I still hate the name SoBro). \n\nFirst off, the atmosphere. This place is beyond superlatives beautiful and tasteful, all at the same time. They've made it obvious it's a nicer place without overwhelming the concert-goer seeking to just enjoy a show with a nice glass of wine. They'll start making their own wine here in 2015 so we'll be interested to go back and see even more of this gorgeous venue.\n\nThe wine. I'm just starting to understand different types of wines and an amateur at best in describing what I want in a wine. The waiter was well-trained and did not lead us astray when we were making our selection from the multiple wines on tap, available for a glass, and those available by a bottle. We tried a couple of these before we left and weren't disappointed. \n\nThe food. It was good, not great. I had the leg of lamb pizza, which was tasty with a good mix of spices, crunchy pine nuts, and melty cheese. She got the Chicken Fricassee which was good but reminded me of much less expensive items I've had elsewhere. The food was tasty and good to munch on during a show or for dinner. I'm probably going to have dinner elsewhere the next time we visit City Winery, however.\n\nPros: Amazing building and predictably great wine selection.\n\nCons: Food was kind of expensive and didn't blow me away. The parking was pretty terrible. They offered paid valet or you can park on the streets, which is not the best option in this neighborhood.\n\nOverall: This a relaxing, romantic place to take a date for a concert. You will win friends  and influence people if you bring someone from out of town in for a concert. If you can stand the parking situation and high-priced food, you'll be elated to make this spot one of your regulars!",

  "text": "After ten years as Executive Chef for the Century Hospitality Group, Chef Paul Shufelt decided it was time to start up a restaurant of his own. The Workshop Eatery officially opened a couple weeks ago in The Mosaic Centre, Canada's largest net-zero commercial building. Choosing to open up in a sustainable building definitely poses its challenges, but supporting local producers, sustainability, and using seasonal produce are concepts important to Chef Paul. \n\nThe Workshop Eatery is located in the far south neighborhood of Summerside, which can be a fair drive for many in Edmonton. But once you enter the building you're greeted by an open space and living wall, which shows how unique and beautiful the Mosaic Centre really is. As for the restaurant, you're greeted into a space that is warm, rustic and inviting. I love the open concept and the visibility of the kitchen - there's nothing to hide! \n\nThroughout the different seasons, the menu will consist of roughly 20 staple dishes and a different feature each day. What makes the menu seasonal will be the different accompaniments and sides to a main dish. If you're ever wondering what's on the menu on a particular day, just check the website! It's amazing that they will be updating their online menu daily! \n\nWe started off our meal with a couple of appetizers, first up was the Arancini ($12). The arancini at Workshop changes daily, and the \"New York Deli\" arancini with deli meats, a balsamic tomato smear, and Nefiss Lazizz Olive Oil was the feature for the day. These fried risotto balls had a golden, crisp exterior, and broke open to reveal a creamy mix of risotto, green peas, and small morsels of meat. I personally prefer my arancini to be rich and cheesy, so these arancini didn't quite deliver for me. \n\nNext up came the Chicken Liver Parfait ($11) served in a small mason jar with crostinis made from Bon Ton Bakery's Cranberry Raisin Nut Bread. The liver was whipped with a mousse-like texture and topped with a port and Saskatoon berry jam. It was a perfect balance between sweet and savoury, and I loved the different textures that the crostini added to the mixture.\n\nOur last starter for the meal was the Duck Carpaccio ($17) featuring Moosewood Acres cured duck breast, pickled shiitakes, carrots, daikon, a soy reduction and blood orange vinaigrette. I really enjoyed the fragrant orange paired with the duck, and the tang of the vinaigrette, but found that the dish was much too salty. Typically a carpaccio dish features meat that is extremely thinly sliced or pounded thin, but the duck in this carpaccio was thickly sliced. The thick slice combined with the soy reduction was quite salty, so with some adjustments to the cut and seasoning, I would really enjoy this dish!\n\nJust like the arancini, The Workshop Eatery has a feature dish each evening. On the night of our visit Tangle Ridge Lamb Chops were being served with a butternut squash, corn and bacon hash. The lamb chops were moist and tender, and looked beautiful against the brightly coloured hash. The hash itself was naturally sweet but lacking in smokiness which we expected from the bacon. As it turns out, we didn't find much bacon in the hash either, so that could have accounted for the discrepancy. \n\nFor myself I ordered the Duck Duck Couscous (how fun is that to say?!) ($32) which featured beautifully seared Moosewood Acres duck breast on a bed of warm couscous with raisins, almonds, pickled cherries and vanilla parsnip puree. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium, and the lightly sweet couscous was a great companion to the duck. The parsnip puree was also a delightful addition to the dish, and complemented both components on the plate. Although I love lamb, the duck was definitely the winner for me and I would happily order it again. \n\nWhen it came down to the desserts, I was torn between two options. The panna cotta at The Workshop Eatery is made with the rooftop honey and would have been my first choice, but I couldn't resist the Croissant Bread Pudding ($9). The flaky croissant pieces are paired with white chocolate and cranberry, giving this dessert some tart notes to balance the sweet. Topped with a generous scoop of Pinocchio's cinnamon ice cream, this was a comforting dessert that I would eat again. \n\nTaken as a whole, we had a great dinner at The Workshop Eatery: our dishes were good and the service was attentive. If there's one thing I love about The Workshop Eatery, it's their commitment to sustainability and supporting local producers. Their decision to move into the Mosaic Centre means that the drive to their restaurant is long and far for many patrons, but the principles of the building align with the values of the restaurant. It's great to see so many local farmers mentioned throughout the menu, and I think it will be interesting to see how things shift once the growing season in Edmonton comes around.",

Once we found a table, I was passed by several servers during a 10 minute time period. After 15 minutes of waiting, the server that was assigned to our section and table came out of the kitchen chewing and eating.\nOnce we flagged him down, we stated that we were ready to order. He then informed us that the kitchen as closed. \n\nWhen we asked, \"When did the kitchen close?\" His reply was: \"When you all walked in.\" I then explained to the server that we had been sitting here for 15 minutes, which he then confirmed, as he stated that he had walked passed us twice. Yet, he never approached our table. I would hate to think that as the only Black patrons in the building that night that it was race related. When we asked to speak to a manager, the manager looked at us and never approached our table. \n\nThis establishment refused to serve us after waiting for several minutes with no service. It is not an inclusive establishment. Being blocks away from historic North Nashville where many people of color reside, this establishment continues to show us the horrors of gentrification. The experience was disgusting and I'm disappointed. \n\n--Dr. B",

Eggs perfect consistency, although the Hollandiase sauce started separating by the time I got home. I did have a 15 min drive and the food was probably sitting for a good 10mins before I picked up too. \n\nThe avocado toast was 1 piece of toast, with a really meager smear of avocado(like the amount that you would spread for butter on toast). The turkey bacon and egg was good. But that was it. A little lacking for the price that you pay for it. \n\nThe strawberry French toast cost $1.50 more than the regular French toast but all I got was some sliced strawberries. She had asked if I wanted fresh strawberries or the strawberry sauce, so I knew what I was getting for the fresh strawberries but I thought there would be more pizazz. On the bright side, the French toast was yummy.",

  "text": "Fish is a hard sell in Alberta.  Pride in Alberta beef (mediocre in my opinion) and distance from the coast play a part in neglecting this healthy protein option.  When I received a great coupon for this particular Joey's, I was reminded that we do like our fish in this house.  We intended to go there with another couple but sickness meant that we were only two that Saturday.\n\nIf location is everything, Joey's is at a disadvantage.  It's hard to see from the street - I recommend using a GPS to locate.  The entrance is also difficult to access because of a concrete walled patio (useless on a cold winter night.  Once inside, the restaurant is roomy, well-lit with a large screen TV on the north wall for those addicted to Hockey Night in Canada.  The staff are friendly and service is initially quick.  My only quibble with the service is that I had to go to the kitchen to ask for coffee and dessert when we were finished our mains.  We never know how we feel about dessert until we finish the first course.  However, the owner served coffee/tea and dessert as well as took our payment.  The waiting staff seemed to be busy with cleaning up, which made us fell slightly rushed.\n\nHow was the food you ask?  My wife had the halibut with mashed potatoes, pronouncing the mash great but the halibut too dry.  I must take her word for it because I learned to dislike mashed because that was the only way my father wanted potatoes served and because I ordered the endless shrimp plate.  I was full with the single serving so I couldn't sample my wife's halibut (which disappeared despite the bad review) or eat any more shrimp.  For dessert, we shared the mud pie, delicious.\n\nThe coupon worked because we plan another visit some time in the future.",

  "text": "I know that I do not need to give any review for this chain restaurant, because I have never wanted to go here anyway. However, we decided to go to this place with my in-laws because we thought it could please everyone (adults and children) and it was one of the few family style restaurants in the West side of town. We have been avoiding dining at Olive Garden for at least 7 years, and now I know we should have gone to another Italian restaurant. \n\nTheir menu is quite extensive and very similar to other Italian restaurants, such as calamari, pizza, spaghetti, salad, chicken or pork scaloppini etc. Everything sounded good in the menu and the pictures looked very enticing.  However, nothing tasted right, and in almost all of their entrees, they have added cheese to their dishes which means extra creamy and FAT. YUCK! Their  kids cheese pizza did not taste good either. The only thing that is fresh is their Garden Salad. The service is good. The price is not cheap for the quality of their food. \n\nWe will cross out Olive Garden from the list...FOREVER.",

  "text": "Suppa had one of the more interesting offerings for Restaurant Week, which is why my wife and I found here on a Friday evening in August 2015. The restaurant had seating outside and being a nice evening, we preferred that option.\n\nLooking through the menu, we decided that one of us would go for the Restaurant week offering while the other of us would order ala carte from the menu. It was nice to have that option and I think not all restaurants have that option when a RW is in progress. The RW menu we chose consisted of crab fritters, mac n' cheese, ricotta cavatelli, and choice of a dessert item. It was nice of them to also include a beverage in the offering. From the ala carte menu, we went for the duck poutine and the cubano melt sandwich. \n\nThe first comment is that the food took a long time to come out. The restaurant was quite busy on a Friday evening and we could only see one server doing the rounds. The first dish to come out were the crab fritters. They were crispy and hot but as my wife puts it, there did not seem to be any crab meat in it. I thought I had found some traces of crab when I first took a bite but I could certainly see what my wife was saying. The next two dishes to come out were the mac n' cheese and the duck poutine. Both dishes were tasty and as the poutine is not something I have often had before, I enjoyed the novelty of the dish. What surprised us were the huge portions. Even though I was very hungry, I decided to not finish all of my duck poutine and leave some room for the other things we had ordered. The cubano melt sandwich was also very nice. The bread was well toasted and the ham, pulled pork and cheese all went nicely together. The cavatelli pasta was quite flavorful too. Finally, when it came to the dessert, we were so full, we just had a cupcake to go and had it at home. \n\nPositives:\n1. Interesting and eclectic menu.\n2. Huge portions - I could have a full lunch based on what was leftover from the meal and even then there were some leftovers.\n3. Reasonable prices - For what was being served, prices were reasonable.\n\nNegatives:\n1. Pretty slow service: We got in at around 9:20 p.m. and left at around 11 p.m. Certainly we were enjoying the evening and lingered on but then a part of the delay can be explained by how long it took for things to come out.\n2. Waters were not refiled promptly. In one instance, my wife requested a glass of water and the waiter, absent-mindedly perhaps, just left her with a glass full of ice. It wasn't until another 5 mins. or so after we could hail the waiter that we were able to have our glasses filled.\n\nOverall, this is the kind of place I would be very excited to have in my neighborhood. I wouldn't have the hassle of having to drive and search for parking and that would make it easy for me just to swing by for perhaps a sandwich or maybe one of their brunch items over the weekend. It is certainly a place I would like to return to.",

  "text": "My husband and I have lived here for almost 4 months.  We really like the apartment that we are in (they call it a townhome), but we do have some complaints about the neighborhood.  There are usually lots of children running around with their parents nowhere to be seen.  There have been times I've been woken in the middle of the night by people being loud, but that has settled some since the neighbors from two doors down moved.  There are lots of dogs in this neighborhood and lots of people that let their cats out during the day.  It is a gated community, however the gate is broken most of the time and be ready to have a lot of people call your phone when trying to enter the gate.  The system allows guests to look up names and have the system call that person to buzz them in the gate.  We get at least one call a day from this.  They have two pools: one is an indoor salt water pool (a little too warm for me) that stays open year round and an outdoor pool that is average size for an apartment complex.  Neither are usually very crowded. If we had it to do over again we would hold out for one of the townhomes on the back of the property on top of the hill.  It seems quieter and more quaint in that area.  Oh and if you have AT&T the service here sucks.  Not sure about any other carriers though.",

The hollandaise sauce was disgusting, not even sure it was hollandaise sauce more like white cream poured over the eggs.  The eggs were the size of quarters, not kidding and didn't even think they could be that tiny....The english muffin was soggy and the potatoes were hard and bland..all in all a pretty poor experience. \n\nThe Good:\nService - A\nI spoke with the manager regarding the my situation and he was more than understanding and accommodating.  The waitstaff is very nice and out going.  \n\nFuture:\nWith at least 5 different spots in the area that have fantastic breakfast options, this restaurant will have to do much better to survive...As this is there 2nd day opening i am going to return in a few weeks to try the food again.....with that being said i am giving this diner a generous 2 out 5 until i try the food again.",

The owner came over to tell us where we were at in line to get a table, and to tell us a little about the menu. He was a unique guy to say the least. Obviously very friendly and passionate about his business. When we got seated we had an extremely friendly server who helped us out. The menu has a lot more of the breakfast options than lunch, and a lot more savory items than sweet. I had the biscuits and gravy which were very good. The Ava potatoes are a little different from what I like. I like a crispy potato at breakfast, and these are a bit more of a breakfast mash type of thing. All in all this was a good breakfast spot and well worth the visit.",

  "text": "My sister in law raves about this restaurant so we trekked all the way from NJ to Philly to try this place. I was initially skeptical, I've been to many a noodle shops in my days ranging from Taipei, HK, LA, to NYC so the bar was high. Still though I was pleasantly surprised by my meal.\n\nFirst off the appetizers were different. They serve a ping pan appetizer where you can choose three appetizers. The beef tendons were rather good! I know I know, who eats beef tendons right??? But this one was different. Slice super thin, wasn't mushy, tender but still had a chewy texture to it. Their appetizer combos also come with pao chai pickled veggies that were pretty tasty.\n\nNoodle texture: glad to report that they are indeed hand drawn! You can choose between the thin noodles and knife cut chunky noodles and the texture was chewy, just what you would expect from a hand drawn noodle\n\nThere's several beef options all of which were tender and flavorful. Try the House Special Combo, comes with a meatball that has a different stuffing/tecture. \n\nThis restaurant also offers other appetizers such as fried mantou's with condensed milk, a slew of boba drinks, smoothies. Service was great and food was served fast! Restaurant was very clean and there are larger tables for groups along with smaller tables. \n\nWord of warning: we came at 130pm for lunch and it was still busy",

We then had one of my favorite Mexican sides, corn on the cob with mayo, cheese, and seasoning. That alone was worth the visit. My fiancé ordered chicken flautas and I ordered the mole enchiladas. It was my first time trying dark mole sauce, and it wasn't my favorite mix of flavors but I appreciated the dish nonetheless. My fiancé's flautas were delicious with fresh salad and guacamole. \n\nDespite being busy, our service was phenomenal. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. At the end, there was a small mix up with our check, but it was handled quickly and very professionally. The staff was apologetic even though we weren't even upset.

Let me start off by saying the experience of purchasing my dress was fine, nothing special they didn't make me feel uncomfortable but it wasn't the experience I wanted. However, the alterations department that this place is unprofessional, rude, and wants to take your money.  3 of my brides mates paid an additional 200$ for alterations on top of 220$ for the dress. They purposely order dress sizes larger to up the cost of the dress and then charge twice as much because the alterations are so dramatic. It was not only for the wedding dress but for each of the bridesmaids dresses too. Each bridesmaid was ordered a dress that was 4 sizes  or more too big. They were charged extra for more fabric and then had extra charges for alterations. The alterations ladies would alter the dress incorrectly or not enough so that additional alterations were needed. I would not  recommend they place to my enemy for weddings dress or dress shopping.",

The noise level was horrible; I had to practically shout to be heard. We ordered a club sandwich (nice portion,) smoked salmon dip (which is delicious,) a Caesar salad, and chicken and waffles. It took about 40 minutes to get our order even though the only things that actually had to be cooked were the chicken and waffles and the fries that came with the club, and still the chicken and waffles came out cold, not lukewarm, but cold and we had to ask another server for syrup.  We sent it back and told them that they could just heat it up instead of making a fresh one; the new plate came out quickly and hot but the waffle was dense and undercooked. The family used to like going here on special occasions b/c is literally within 6 blocks of home, but this is the last time we'll take our chances. It's sad because this place had so much promise when it opened but the prices aren't worth the noise, cold food, and slow service.",

Little care is taken with the garlic spinach not to overpower the dish. \n\nThe steak offerings have been the same for too long, and technique has suffered. My husband loves the Cowboy ribeye so when I stopped by for a solo cocktail, I got one \"to go\" to surprise him. There were grill marks on one side and gray nothingness on the other. This steak had not seen a broiler at all. I thought perhaps they cook it differently for take out. I inquired on my next visit and was assured it was supposed to be exactly the same. I don't mind paying a premium price for a premium steak. Premium price when I could have gotten a better sear at home in my cast iron pan? No thanks. While this is just one example, we have been unimpressed with the food and outdated menu for some time. Dry aged or grass fed beef? Nowhere to be found. I can now get prime beef at BJs. That alone isn't a selling point anymore.",

  "text": "Who doesn't like to pick their own steak ? I love it! As soo as you walk in they're right there to get your menu selection off to a good start. Our server was a young man named Paul, I like him because he went out of his way to make sure that my wife and daughter were taken care of with their orders from beginning to end. When he initially came over to introduce himself and take our drink order, he knelt right beside me and my daughter looked at me and asked/stated... \"Daddy, your face is saying that he committed a Man-Law Violation?! Yes, yes he did... much too close. But no points are deducted when a person is giving great hospitality and service.  Makes me wonder if everything really is BIGGER in Texas.\n\n\nLet's see how the main coarse goes... 45 minutes later... So I had a 16oz sirloin and it melted like butter! Great steak! The house steak sauce was another story altogether... watered down, very bland and not a good pairing for such an amazing steak. Thanks once again to Paul for rescuing a choice steak with a bottle of A1 steak sauce.\n\nOur appetizers were great as well, thanks Paul for the suggestion of a \"Triple Treat\" Potato skins, fried pickles (Amanda's favorite) and buffalo wings. My daughter loved her baked potato but was a title puzzled by the chicken tenders because they looked more like chicken nuggets.\n\nOverall, great Job Paul! We live closer to the Wesley Chapel location but this was a great fill-in spot.",

The bullseye section was pretty small compared to other stores but somehow I found the ducks I was looking for both times. I don't know if no one really buys that stuff here or the staff do a really good job of restocking it. They had a lot of the Disney ducks so I was able to get 2 full sets and give some to my niece as well. \n\nI was also looking for peeps plush stuffed animals that I couldn't find anywhere and I ended up finding a bunch in the holiday section in the  back on the top of a shelf. \n\nThis target never seems to be overwhelmingly crowded either with so many people trying to grab stuff from the bullseyes section.

  "text": "We were super excited to find an Italian Deli near Indian Rocks Beach, this review COULD have been so much higher but when we ordered our sub we asked for a roast beef, extra red roasted peppers, extra fresh mozzarella and Mayo. The young man taking our order told that because we wanted a crunchy bread that sandwich would be $14 we were like fine. We also requested that part of the sandwich have just a little mayo and ham for our child. He said he would make 3/4 with roast beef and 1/4 with ham with very little mayo, said perfect. He asked if we wanted tomatoes and lettuce we said no thank you.  He hands me the sandwich with lettuce and tomato, so we said we asked no tomatoes no lettuce- he started to reply that wasn't the case. We explained one of us is allergic to tomatoes could he please remake the sandwich. He did but this why I am giving this deli 1 star if I could I would lower it!!! He obviously just wiped the lettuce and tomatoes off the sub. When someone is allergic to something they can't ingest it. So now we are on the beach and I paid over $21.47 for a sandwich that has been fingered to get the items off it and given back to us. The ham has a ton of mayo not light mayo so now I need to find a new meal to order from since we can't take the risk of an allergic reaction. This was very disappointing! I know we are specific on what we want but there are reasons why we are so specific. This sandwich is not a difficult one to make especially for an Italian Deli! Note to management / Owner you need to train your deli staff to take allergies more seriously at this place.",

  "text": "So what happened to this Nordstrom? Customer service is terrible, the floor (at least upstairs) is way under staffed and the staff that is on the floor is not super helpful. \nFor instance I was looking for a shirt for family pictures, I wanted a navy or red wine colored shirt. When I asked the lady (from whichever section NYDJ is sold) if they had any good navy or red wine colored shirts she said \"oh I'm sure there are some around, let me know if you find something and need a room\". Hmmm that's not what I was hoping for. \nThen there was an older lady in the shoe dept that had no knowledge of shoes and a super attitude! It was bizarre. \nThe staff that used to be there, like 4 years ago was awesome! Now it's sub-par. \nI hate to be like this but are the employees at Nordstrom aware they are there to help/serve us the customers? \nSo for the time being I will be ordering my (and family's) stuff Nordstrom online and will dread the days I have to make returns. \n\nNovember 2018\nI just don't understand this place. The majority of the people that work here have the worst attitude. The only ones I have encountered that don't seem to hate their job are the ones in the men's department and a few in the shoes. \nThe ladies upstairs in tbd and bp are just down right pissed off at the world. I walked around with my hands full of stuff I wanted to try on for over 10 minutes, then I had to ask for a room and a lady said \"yeah they are right there\" pointed me in the direction-didn't grab the stuff, or help in any way. I was so annoyed at the whole situation I scanned what I wanted and ordered it online just so no one got commission from me. \nNordstrom are you listening? This store needs some leadership and culture training.",

  "text": "Schenk's Family Bakery on Veree Avenue in the Fox Chase neighborhood of Philadelphia, has been in the flour, water and yeast business since the early twentieth century when their first generation started baking in Germany before immigrating to Germantown  and opening their shop in 1938. Both the family and the bakery have moved around, but always remained Philly centric. Their recipes travelled well.\n\nToday, their storefront is small and lined with glass display cases and shelved walls, all full of their classic cookies, doughnuts, cupcakes, custom iced cakes and amazing pound cake. My small sample of half dozen doughnuts (glazed, vanilla iced, cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar) were all fresh, lightly yeasty and full of sweet flavor. They were perfect for accompaniment with hot coffee. \n\nThe vanilla pound cake was dense, moist and was solidly superior to any commercial effort I have eaten. Better even than Starbucks, which has been on my pedestal for a long while. It would have been great heated with a scoop of ice cream, but stood unapologetically on its own. Why they loaded it up on three sides with copious amounts of white icing is a mystery. It was truly an amazing sugar coating, but unnecessary given the quality of what it covered. Diabetic overkill. \n\nThat shelf of large Eagles playoff cakes looked great and gave comfort that they would be the hit of any party or cold afternoon tailgate at the Linc. Unfortunately, the sweetness would not be enough to change the outcome of the game to come.",

The company helped with planning lunch in the area and picked it up for us to picnic at a winery. The bus driver was so nice and fun and willing to take as many photos that we wanted. All the recommended wineries were great. And it helped that the driver knew the wineries and their staff well. We had so much fun! I highly recommend.",

This bar almost brings a tear to my eye.. \n(I said almost, dammit!!)\nThis reminds me of the bars from back in the day.. Smoking is allowed.. The bar and cooler is stocked with plenty of affordable drinks and beer.. Please don't walk in asking for your favorite craft beer...\nPeople sitting at the bar and tables telling the same stories you've might have heard the last time you were there... But it's still entertaining.. \nA jukebox full of good music.. and a kitchen in the back that I've heard have some really good food, although I can't confirm it.. Apparently lunchtime opening isn't an option.. \nBring a few bucks.. Say hello to Jasmine the bartender. She was pretty pleasant and attentive. and enjoy.. Bars like these are fading and you'll miss them when they're gone..\nUYE anyone??\nBut first, somebody send an I Love Yelp sticker to put on this bar's door..",

  "text": "As a Filipino living in Nashville, you can just imagine how excited I was to hear about this place so we just had to try it!\n\nCame tonight during their happy hour from 4-6. Mannnn were they packed! Nashville is definitely excited to try this restaurant out as they should!\n\nSitting right in the heart of the gulch, right across Sambuca, the restaurant is beautiful inside. It's big and it can hold big parties. I even saw a segregated room which hopefully you can reserve for private dinner.\n\nWe sat at the bar and had their happy hour cocktails. Delicious! But I do want to talk about food so let's get to it.\n\nPORK ADOBO FRIED RICE: this is the BEST thing that I've had just yet. It is honestly perfect and just right. Bartender even told me that this is the most underrated dish they have- people never order it. But he said it's what he always get at the end of his shift. It is DELICIOUS! GET IT!!!!!!\n\nSISIG:. Traditionally made with left overs from a pig's face - this is a traditional bar food in the Philippines. Don't worry! They only serve it with pork belly! It was my favorite from everything we've ordered. \nUpdate- it was really good the first time we had it. The 2nd time, I wish it was a little crispier.\n\nLUMPIA: traditional egg rolls. You know, I'm a little biased because I've had so many lumpia growing up. I've had better but my husband thought it was good.\n\nBAO: I had their pork belly bao. Really delicious! The bun is on point and that's always the hardest to make. \n\nCHICKEN INASAL: decent. Not bad. I didn't think it was amazing but I didn't think it was bad either.\n\nSUNDA SUNDAE: dessert and it's their take on the traditional Halo-Halo dessert. You should try it! Also Halo-Halo literally translate to Mix-Mix so when you order this, take a picture, then mix it all together. You have to mix it until the Ube ice cream is completely melted. Trust me!\n\nRIDICULOUS: this was pretty good. It's basically ice cream wrapped with cake. I thought it was just ok. \n\nService Was good, too! It was their first week so one of the items that we ordered didn't arrive so our bartender gave us our dessert for free. I thought that was really nice. Shoutout to them!\n\nParking- there is another parking garage across Bar Louis and it's really cheap parking. There's also a parking garage literally right next to it in the same building so don't worry about that!\n\n\nOverall, I'm so glad we tried this place and I'm so glad they decided to open a restaurant in Nashville!",

Super friendly staff and gorgeous restaurant! We ate outside and really enjoyed the vibes. Didn't get a picture of it but the double dip app was phenomenal! Drinks are also well-priced too - the $5 Mexican draft (Monopolio) really hit the spot with the burger! One of the co-owners Maren stopped by our table to chat and introduce herself which we thought was really cool - definitely excited to make this our go-to neighborhood spot, and can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu!",

The thrill of finding the hidden treasure is hard to explain unless you yourself are avid thrifter, a dumpster diver and a price checker! \n\nI had bookmarked my stops before traveling to Northern Liberties. And Once Worn was definitely in the to do list. As I walked up I could see a SALE rack! Those discounted racks can be the quick fix for sure. It  was my lucky day. I saw it hidden...it was a ..Catherine Malandrino dress!!! Wow! And in black! I tried to contain my glee for the true test. \n\nThen....dun dun dun...dressing room! The place that is the true decisions maker in my book.  I closed the curtain and the clerk remarked the Velcro that connects the curtain to the wall. Brilliant! I hate it when there's a little gap and people can see in. And then when I slipped the dress on..it was easily a Va-Va-Voom dress!! Fit like a glove! And I have to wear black at work some days. It was also work appropriate, flattering and feminine. There was black on black leopard pattern in the front section down. Gorgeous. \n\nI felt the need to pay and try to not tempt myself to buy the whole store. The clerk and I chatted for like 15 minutes! She was a total sweetheart! \n\nI had so much fun I told my friend who's into vintage to check it out! And from what I hear she made out like a bandit! Lulu Guinness was amongst the loot. Another one of my faves! This place is on my list for all future visits!! And I almost wanted to not review and keep it alllllll to myself but I'm too nice! Enjoy and find some treasures!",

  "text": "This is more of an \"I'm in shock\" review than anything else. We love Fork, we eat here every few months. But today after brunch, we brought home a cinnamon roll for my daughter who couldn't come along with us. I snuck a bite and THERE WAS A BUTTON in the dough! \n\nWe called the restaurant and after being put on hold for a good amount of time, the acting manager came on the line and was less than sympathetic. His response to the situation was super awkward and borderline rude. He noted that the chef was wearing the same coat as he was yesterday when making the rolls and no button was missing (ok, ew - why no clean coat?!) but that they'd \"look into it\" and someone would call me tomorrow. (I had to ask him if he needed my phone number to call me back so not sure about the sincerity of that statement. )\n\nWe were polite and definitely are not looking for a handout, freebie, etc., just thought the restaurant should know that a customer bit into a button. Why not just take responsibility and apologize? Super disappointed with the way the situation was handled, and now feeling like the kitchen is less clean/sanitary than we thought. Thumbs down, Fork. Photo of button for the manager who seemed to believe that a lost button in the cinnamon roll was impossible.",

She recommended an appetizer that was very thin like pita bread almost paperthin and it had a very fresh pico de Gallo on top with cilantro onions tomatoes and a sauce that we really liked. I ordered the chicken tiki masala. I'm not an expert on it but it tasted very good. My wife is vegan and they really bent over backwards to make some dishes for her. She didn't care too much for one dish but I liked it. The other Dish she did like it I wish I could remember the name but if you are vegan just let them know and they will make some suggestions or modify a dish for you. The prices were very reasonable in my opinion",

The crew brought it into the house unboxed the couch and put it together half way. Then hands me the clipboard and says sign for furniture. So I did and crew left. My husband and I put the furniture the rest of the way together and I noticed that the middle piece of the sectional was sagging in the back. So of course this place of business was closed to call anyone so we said we would call first thing in the morning on Monday. So I called and the gentleman I spoke to told me that there was nothing they were going to do because we shouldn't have signed for the furniture and asked if we purchased the warranty which we did and told us we needed to go through them to get the sectional replaced. I told the gentleman that I was floored that I would receive damaged furniture and have to make a warranty claim already. He said that how do they know that we didn't break the furniture over night I didn't even have the energy to fight with this gentleman. So my husband called the warranty company the next day and started a claim, the lady that was helping him said she was going to get into contact with the furniture store because if they delivered it damaged they needed to bring out a new piece. So after couple days of back and forth the furniture store said we were sol and warranty would have to cover it. Husband got back in contact with the lady that was helping him and she told him that they weren't going to replace it because the gentleman that she was dealing with at the furniture store admitted to her that the furniture was indeed BROKEN when it left the warehouse July 15th in the evening!!! So now we are stuck with a broken couch and no one to help replace or fix the couch.",

  "text": "In spite of many hipster references on Yelp to this business, I ventured to it late on a weekend night on a simple quest for good pizza.\n\nThat actually reminds me of one of my favorite hipster jokes: Why did the hipster burn his tongue on the slice of pizza? Because he wanted to eat it before it was cool.\n\nLee's pizza is tasty, made with care and the toppings you order on a custom pie are plentiful. And from what I saw while waiting for my pizza, the wings looked good as well. Those came out to a small group sitting near me at the bar that included a man who clearly needed some food in his stomach.\n\nIn my opinion, two people can easily fill themselves on this small size pizza while enjoying a drink or two to wash it down. \n\nThere are plenty of beer options, most of which are available in coolers appropriate for a small and older grocery store. There are a handful of craft beers on draft as well and apparently they do pour some wine too...or those wine bottles are just to hold big fake roses and throw people off.\n\nUnfortunately for people like me who drink \"crap on tap,\" as Mr. Dunderbak calls it, Lee's has none of that. Not even \"crappy crap\" in cans or bottles like PBR or The Champagne of Beers. Which is fine, I get it. They kindly offer Coke products for us old souls who do like French toast, but want the actual breakfast and not a huge brown bottle at an 8.8% ABV.\n\nObviously, they keep it real simple here: Pizza, wings, craft beer. Seems like they know what they're doing and the employees openly appreciate their customers.\n\nAs I finish this review, the Yelp survey questions below include \"Good for Dancing: Yes, No, Not Sure.\" I marked \"No\" because the only folks dancing here have had way too much of that French toast beer or ABV equivalent and not enough of their quality pizza.",

This location isn't in the best spot. It's near downtown and near the expressway. We were walking back to our hotel after doing the Honky  Tonk bars, so we ignore the untidy area and went inside. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. The menu on the board still had excellent prices and the same food items.  This is definitely the place to go for a good cheap meal, and the must-have milk shakes.",

We wanted to have another beer with our meal but he almost never even came back so we just got our check and left. We were thirsty! However, I will say he had wayyy too many tables for one person and could've used some help for how busy it was. All in all we really enjoyed our visit to Napoleon House.",

  "text": "Bravo! They did such a great job making this place special, as it seemed to have many unique and interesting touches. Very much enjoyed our visit here; from the magic to the ambiance, it was superb. They have an amazing collection of ancient playing cards, and Houdini's handcuffs. The upclose magic was really stunning, and two of the magicians really stood out as incredible, a mentalist and a guy with a floating cigarette, both leaving us scratching our heads and guessing days and days later! The food was okay, prices were high, but since you don't pay separately for the magic, it made sense. Would definitely be a repeat customer, but wonder if they rotate out the magicians/acts or if its the same guys indefinitely.",

The rooms were immaculately clean, but the furnishings and amenities were worn and definitely ready for the recycle bin. \n\nThe service at the hotel was wonderful!  The staff were wonderfully friendly, which definitely made up for any disappointment in the decor.  The evening reception featured an open bar and snacks, which was right up my alley as I had to go back to my room to  pack for a 6 am flight.  The hotel is close to the Saguaro National Park, which offers a stunning view of Tucson and its desert beauty.  It's also close to many restaurants and a Target in case you forgot something.  \n\nI hope to be able to return after the renovation so that I can really take in all of the improvements!!!",

This would have been 5 stars except for the noise level (so loud we could barely hear ourselves think and were shouting to converse). We didn't have drinks so I can't comment on those. Our food was really delicious though and I give all of what we ordered a thumbs up. One person in our party had the mussels and almost licked the bowl. Another person had the fish tacos (celiac so it was nice for her to have a full gf option) and I had the salmon poke (dairy sensitivity so again, nice that they were so accommodating) and it was truly amazing. It sounded good and was not disappointing. We each only had an appetizer size portion, but honestly, that was perfect. What was served at other tables looked and smelled great as well. If you can sit outside (it was raining so that wasn't an option), I would think that's a good place. Enjoy!",

The only spice i could taste in both mine and my wife's dish was salt or msg.  And lots of it.  More spices are definitely needed for Mexican style food.  The fajitas were bland, and the bacon wrapped shrimp tasted like they used Hormel pre-cooked microwavable bacon. I have seriously had better bacon at McDonalds.  The rice was as unflavorful as the rest of the meal, and even the guacamole, their namesake, tasted like it came from a can.    There are way too many superior Mexican restaurants in the area at a much cheaper cost for me to consider returning.  I would even consider Chipotle a superior restaurant.  Guac is one step above Taco Bell, but charges super premium prices.",

They have a set menu of drinks that are all fairly good (the Off-Duty Sailor was certainly interesting) and one of my favorite tricks is to request whatever the bartender wants to make.

Jacks or better $1 video poker are 9-5 machines, others are 8-5. Video blackjack lets you split and double down even at the $0.25 bet (yes!).

They have a poker room (of course), and if they have a sports book section, I didn't see it.\n\nTo the other reviewer: sounds obvious, but don't gamble money you can't afford to loose.

We used them to build a $36,000 spool (2500 gal in ground heated spa) They also sell PATIO furniture and build POOLS. And offer service and supplies.\n We had a rental with pool which tenants let go green without telling us quickly during Monsoon. We spent a lot in chemicals and tested frequently when told to. Finally got it under control. The last time I was in one of their stores was when I took a water sample in and the lady said    \n\"you know we usually like to do these tests about once a month. The testing piece we use cost a bit of money\"\n  So everyone who has never been to an E-Konomy Pool store should go there next time they need any pool/spa supplies or service. Tell them Kevin McConnell sent you.",

I loved the cute decor, and the menu was small but had a few great choices. Everything on the menu starts with a \"c\" which is so cute and clever! We had the lobster Mac n cheese, which was good, and it had enough fresh lobster within. My crustacean roll was good with lobster and shrimp and coleslaw mixed in. I wish the garlic butter marinade was more flavorful, but it was still yummy. The cowboy burger was huge and flavorful, and the house made Oreo cheesecake was shareable and also yummy! Service was great also!",

The meals were excellent with the fish surprisingly crisp (even with a 15 minute drive home). We anticipate enjoying Teddy's By the Sea again very soon.

My husband loves the Motivation Destroyer IPA, so appropriate for the times we are in and so, so good.  And the cheeseburgers with brioche bun and fries....heaven.

It's a chic little spot that sells uber high-end products.\nA.J. cut my hair and did a good job.  She gave me a nice overall trim with some layers in the front.  Perked up my color-- \nI didn't ask for anything radical so-- not sure what I can grade this place on.\nMake sure you look at the prices if you decide to buy some of their products.  I fell in love with the smell of their \"organic\" line of shampoos and conditioners.  I even had both bottles with me at the check out counter--\nThat is, until I realized they were $26 dollars a bottle!  Yeow...  that's above my budget for hair products, even if I do like the scent.\nHappy haircuts!",

  "text": "Our visit: This was our first visit. We visited on a Saturday at 7:30pm. \n\nThe reservation: The hostesses had a few mess ups with us. There were two working the hostess stand. The older woman (post 50) who is vivacious and energetic answered the phone the first time we called and pretended the restaurant was very unavailable. I called at 6pm asked for the first available table for the night for 2. She said they were avail at 8:15pm. I asked if there was anything earlier and she said maybe 8pm and eventually quoted 7:30pm as if she was doing us a big favor for a party of 2. After grappling with the consideration of waiting an hour for the table, I called again. This time the younger hostess answered the phone. She said there was no wait. LOL. So we arrived and there was no wait. ..........\n\nThe strawberry feta salad: amazing!!!! I devoured that salad. \n\nChicken parm: I didn't eat the chicken because the pasta was so good, but the pasta was amazing. \n\nThe lava cake: this is not a lava cake. It is a brownie that has not been cooked all the way through. I didn't eat much of it. \n\nThe service: now, despite all the flubs, this is why I can not in good conscience give less than four stars. Our server, Maria, was wonderful!! She was calm, collected, knowledge, and delightful. We later learned she's worked there for eight plus years. We briefly interacted with a young food runner with a bad attitude. She was 25-35 in age, thinning blonde hair in a ponytail, slender, corse in demeanor and a tad condescending. I held my tongue and was exceedingly polite to her to counter her condemnation and my usually obtuse husband actually noticed her rudeness and commented after she left the table. I later needed my waitress mostly because the foodrunner kind of left without saying anything-- haha I assume she's a food running because why else would she behave that way. I noticed another server, Kevin, walk by and asked him if he could get our waitress. He responded by saying that he could help us. And we learned from him that our server, Maria, is his wife and they met at this restaurant and have been working there for eight years. They were both so calm and courteous. Next time I return, I'll be sure to request that one of them take care of us on the off chance that the food runner is actually a server and she is our waitress next time. \n\nThe ambiance: sit down. There is a coat rack near the booths and it's a full service restaurant with evening lighting.",

I grew up with Pat's, Gino's, Steve's, Tony Luke's and Greenmans in my backyard.....\nI know what a good cheesesteak, hoagie or pork sandwich is. \nMaybe this place had a bad day, but I don't see myself coming back here any time soon. \nThe pork roll sandwich with spinach was very bland, there was a spice on it but otherwise the pork itself held no flavor. The only thing that was tasty about this sandwich was the roll. \nThe ultimate Italian hoagie was actually pretty good, it had good quality and tasty meats and cheese but it was sliced way too thick that one couldn't even fold it into a hoagie. It basically was an open roll. All the tomatoes and onions rolled off the top. The roasted peppers embedded in the sandwich were very good. \nThe bacon cheese fries, I wouldn't give to my pups. The cheese was very lumpy and thick, the bacon was very greasy and flabby and the French fries themselves were very soggy.  I can't believe people actually order these. \n\nLike I mentioned before, maybe this was a bad day for Pudges, but after reading all the raves from here, I definitely expected something edible and good.",

  "text": "I've been to Urban Farmer twice and my only gripe is the service (hence the four out of five stars). My first visit was spent at the bar area where I waited 15 minutes to order a drink! Then another 15 minutes to get a menu. Mind you it was a Tuesday night and they were not busy at all! Maybe I should sit in the middle of the bar as opposed to the side but regardless, patrons should never have to wait that long to be served... Or acknowledged. For my second visit, I decided to take my sister and her husband to dine in. We were seated right away. Awesome. We were offered bread! Hell yes we want bread! You would think the bread would come right away but it didn't. It actually came out with our appetizers.... No big deal though. Our main courses also came shortly after. I can continue to complain about the service but it really wasn't completely terrible. \n\nOverall, I think the place is amazing! I am also obsessed with the interior design... I seriously could live there! \n\nSo let's talk food. Everything I had was amazing! I ordered the duck and my sister and her hubby ordered the steak sampler to share. We also ordered brussels, mushrooms, butternut squash,  foie gras and bone marrow to share. Out of all the appetizers, I enjoyed the foie gras and marrow the most... but everything was just delicious! If you're a big meat eater, I suggest ordering the steak sampler! Worth the money! For my next visit, I'm going to go for the cheese cart and some dessert!\n\nThis is not only a great place for locals to dine, but a place tourists or guests at the Logan Hotel can appreciate. \n\nCan't wait to go back!",

  "text": "Three Sixty is a great place for drinks and appetizers with spectacular views and good ambiance. I've been there about a dozen times. I've used valet every time. The reason for my negative review, however, is that on my last visit, the valet driver damaged by vehicle and did not say anything to me. It wasn't as if they didn't know they did it - they hit the frame directly and hard. And my vehicle which is only a few months old stays parked in my garage all day every day. I wash it twice a week. I know exactly when the damage happened. I called the hotel and asked for the valet manager. Someone took a written message yet no response was received from the valet manager. I called again, asking for the valet manager, and had to leave a voice mail. Again, no response was received. That's poor business etiquette and shows apathy towards a good customer. The reputation of Three Sixty is highly tarnished in my mind. The date of the incident was April 3, 2013.\n\n\nUpdate, July 2013:\n\nAfter posting this, the valet manager did call me and they rectified the situation completely. Today will be the first time I've visited Three Sixty since the incident.",

  "text": "Initially when we moved it in seemed great, till move in day. Cheap paint, cheap everything. Floor is peeling up by their fake wood, which they will most likely try to charge us for even though it was like that the day we moved in. But that little compared to other issues.\n\nSince day one my wife and I experienced humidity levels in the 75-80% range. I told management a total of 3 times, which they never did anything about, because why would they do their job? The result of the humidity was MOLD starting to grow on decorations we have, which we ended up throwing out. The response I got from the complex was \"buy a dehumidifier\" or \"change the ac unit\". The ac units in the building are oversized ptac units which result in little to no dehumidification because they only sense dry bulb temps. Mix that with the cheap windows (I feel the draft coming in, plus a consistency of spiders I find in my apartment). Management said they would \"check on the humidity issue\" which they never have. And to management, the issue is fine now BECAUSE it's winter and there's a lack of humidity in the air. So that you for your \"concern\". But this will become an issue again in the summer. If you like to sleep comfortable do not live here. I can only imagine mold growing inside the walls this summer and us getting charged for it. \n\nNext issue,\n\nMy wife had been contacting the lady in the management office (I call her out because I don't know her name and she is the only one my wife has contacted) for our utility bill because we like to pay our bills on time. 2 months later it took a negative yelp review from her (which she took down because she is nice and the other lady who comments on these yelp reviews asked her to in exchange to waive the previous months utility bills we were waiting on). They finally sent us a bill, which was not waived, and as my wife fulfilled her end the manager who said she would waive it did not. We have all this communication in writing, and I might take this to court just for principle, because my wife also emailed her 4 times for verification the utility has been waived, but my wife has been ignored ever since she removed her yelp review (which is why I am doing one now). \n\nI have also been waiting for a parking pass for almost 2 months. The only reason that vehicle hasn't been towed is because security now knows my work vehicle. \n\nIf possible this would be zero star rating for this \"complex\". But because I can't, I guess the positive star goes to the front desk staff and security because they're always friendly and ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB. Maintenance as well, they always do their job well. \n\nThis is not all the issues I have just some of them. I would not recommend to move into this place. We are almost sure we will not be renewing our lease due to the multiple failures of management, and \"upper management\". \n\nTo the lady who comments on the yelp reviews and lied to my wife, you can be sure this review will not be edited or removed. Y'all have lied to us entirely too much for you to be trusted. And I have all your communication with my wife in writing too, which I may use as evidence. But for the time being, we are just going to pay our bills on time. And management stop giving my wife dirty looks or ignoring her because she called you out. \n\nDo not be fooled by the mimosas and smiles when you come in and look. The leasing office didn't even know the place takes money orders for rent payment (because paying online they just steal more money from you).",

My stepdad went in to see what was wrong with his car, and was told he needed his alternator replaced. Firestone wanted to charge $150 for labor and over $300 for the part. We found the part listed for cheaper elsewhere and asked if they could just do the labor if we brought in our own part, they said YES but that labor would be $160.\nAs soon as we actually purchase the part and headed into Firestone for the labor, they changed their mind and said they could not do the labor unless the part was purchased there. That is a total lie and a scam! Horrible customer service and company policy. I am appalled and this company should not still be in business.",

I don't know when Pitman stopped being a dry town so this is the first restaurant/bar in the town that we know of. The service is very good, the menu diverse and their beer selection includes local brews.  I would have given 5 stars were it not for the high prices.  We paid $17.00 for a flatbread pizza which did taste very good.  The wings are $14 for 8 split wings, once again done very well and tasty but a bit pricey.  My hope is that these prices are in effect to allow them to stay in business during the pandemic and employ people in a newer establishment but these prices may stop repeat customers.  We have been there three times, we love the ambiance but paying center city prices in this area is tough.",

It was super cold and I asked for a hot drink with something fun in it, she said let me check with the bartender. I heard her ask and then they gave her a hard time with recommendations. She never came back with suggestions on what we could order for drinks. Then she disappeared for at least 15 min. No one came over during that time. We were just about to leave when finally the bartender came out to ask us what we wanted. Really?! We already told the girl and you were the one giving her lip. It was so cold outside and we really wanted to warm up so we just ordered two coffees and a shot of Kailua, $17!? Another 10 min later our drinks came. We wanted to eat but after how long the drinks took we decided coffee was it. Unbelievable poor service. We're on our way to K-Paul's for lunch instead.

The section was $350 and we rented two. Fine. It came with 2 bottles of Ciroc- blah blah. Well when we arrived, we also had food trays for our guests to be placed on the tables in the section we paid $700 for. When we arrived, the we asked the Manager Rife Whiting if we could bring the trays. He replied \"no problem. Place them on your tables in your section.\" Somewhere between transferring the trays in and walking past him again, he said \"well there's really no food policy. We've never allowed food. It's $20 per tray\". Mind you, we had 5 trays in our section. I turned and said, \"$700 for the section and another $100 for the trays? If there isn't a food policy, where did this fee come from?\" I kid you not-- he told me, \"well I'm the manager and I can make up whatever I want to when I want to and if you dont want to pay this fee you can either take your food back to your car or I will take it for you.\" --- at that point. The situation escalated and my friends had to calm me down. That's bogus. It's not even about the made up fee but the tone and abuse of position.

Since I can't, I rounded up to 4.00/5.00 for the delicious wine and great atmosphere.\n\nOn my visit to Nashville, a friend who has lived in Nashville for 3 years suggested going to Rumours. It is labeled a Wine Bar for a reason - the waitress recommended a medium body French Pinot Noir that was easy to drink and did not break the bank. The wine went down like water, resulting in splitting two bottles between two people.\n\nWe paired the wine with the cheese plate, the meatballs, & the mussel bowl with spaghetti. The cheese plate came with four wedges of cheese, including a delicious goat cheese, tomato marmalade, nuts, and an array of bread and crackers. I enjoyed all of the cheeses, except the Dijon, and would recommend asking to substitute this cheese for an additional goat cheese or the server's suggestion.\n\nThe mussel bowl came fresh to order in a white wine & capers sauce topped with feta cheese. I will most definitely order this plate on my next visit to Rumours and highly recommend it to any guest.\n\nLastly, the meatballs were tasty but tiny. I expected the serving size of 4 meatballs as it was on under the small plates section on the menu. I was surprised that the 4 meatballs were roughly 1 inch in diameter. Still, the carrot-apple-fennel slaw complement the dish perfectly. At $8 a plate, I would suggest a try if you like meatballs but recommend ordering at least 2 for tables of more than 2 people.\n\nTwo bottles and a few small plates later, we stumbled out vowing to revisit the next time that I visit. I hope to go back when the weather is a nicer to sit in the gorgeous outside area.",

  "text": "I just leased a 2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. The salesman was great.  Service, not so!  On a side note, I love how the manufacturer sends out a survey within days of buying a vehicle wanting to know how much you love the vehicle.  Not just jeep but they all do it.  I always respond with...give me 6 months to a year so I can drive it in different conditions.  Then I'll let you know.  I never respond with \"I love it\" in the first few days.  On my drive home from the dealership I noticed an excessive amount of wind noise coming from the passenger side roof area.  I know this vehicle isn't aerodynamic so don't go there. I understand! But the noise on the passenger side was far more noisy than the driver side.  So, I decided I was going to take it back to have it checked.  In the meantime, the blinker that is supposed to blink three times automatically when you move the lever up or down (not locked) worked intermittently.  Most of the time it did blink three times but occasionally it would only blink once.  So, I added this to the list.  They kept it for two days.  Famous quote...\"nothing is wrong\".  So I asked, what did you do for two days.  The answer;  We drove it and the wind noise is normal and the blinker never malfunctioned. So I asked, do you believe me that the blinker occasionally malfunctions or do you think I'm making this up?  They said they believe me.  I asked: So if it did malfunction when you were driving it what action would you take?  It was like a dear looking at me in the headlights.  A blank stare.  He finally said he'd have to call technical service.  I asked why he didn't do that in the first place?  He said he had to diagnose it.  I asked, rather sarcastically, did you have some diagnostic equipment connected while driving it so that if it did happen you could troubleshoot it?  He said no, they just need to see it.  Unbelievable!  He said, as long as it doesn't happen for him, there is nothing wrong.  So, reluctantly on my part, we moved on to the wind noise.  Again, he said there was nothing wrong but...they put down a bead of silicone.  I asked why?  If there is nothing wrong, why put down a bead of silicone?  Because we felt it might help.  If there is nothing wrong and its, as you say, normal, why put down a bead of silicone?  Is there a problem or not?  No problem, we just decided to put down a bead of silicone.  A couple of weeks later (4th of July) I ran my jeep through a car wash in West Chester.  Within an hour, and on a 90+ degree day the A/C unit malfunctioned. Air flow went to a minimum.  I changed fan speed and while I could hear the fan increase in speed there was no change in output.  Minimal air flow and the vehicle started getting hot.  After about an hour and a half of this it finally began running properly again.  I called the dealership and told them what happened.  The answer, unless it does it for us we can't do anything about it.  Are you serious?  Are there louvers in the duct work?  Could one of them have gotten stuck?  Is there an area where water from a car wash could have affected or gotten into something to cause this?  Again, where is the diagnostics in all of this?  Simple answer is always, unless it happens for us we can't do anything about it.  Most frustrating group I've ever dealt with.  I HATE THIS JEEP and the fact there is not one competent person to work on it or someone who will take the initiative to diagnose the issues.  Worst purchase I ever made and what makes it so difficult is now that the sale is done, no one cares!  No one!  Oh, but the survey's keep coming.  Such a joke, an absolute joke.  Oh, to top it off, I was told to take it to David's Jeep in Glen Mills.  Perhaps they can find the problem.  Now that's a comforting thought. Just pass the problem on to someone else and in the meantime I'm having to run all over the place.  Never again.",

Everything was neatly packed and the food was still warm by the time we drove back home to eat. There's no indoor seating, it's a takeaway set up, but we saw a few other patrons eating in their parked cars. Service was very friendly and the guy who helped us wore a mask. \n\nOn our first trip, we ordered the jerk chicken and curry chicken. Both were excellent! Hubby described the jerk chicken as \"fall off the bone.\" Our sides were fried plantains, 4 cheese baked mac, veggie fried rice and rice & peas. All were tasty, but the plantains were the standout for me. We also tried one each of the pastries: pine tart (pineapple filling), ground beef patty and 4 cheese roll. Again, all were delicious! They threw in a caribbean lemonade and sorrel (hibiscus tea) that were the perfect things to top off our meals! \n\nIn addition to their standard menu, The Pepper Pott offers rotating specials, which are announced on their Instagram along with pictures to make your mouth water. Some of the specials have been jerk salmon, bake & salt fish and curry goat. \n\nDefinitely give this family-run small business a try!!",

  "text": "Do you ever feel like sometimes you were born inside The Matrix? While everyone one else's brain is receiving signals that say the food is juicy and delicious, all you taste is 'a single cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals... everything the body needs' but taste buds don't desire.\n\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nI read the reviews and came here with the highest of expectations. Immediately this place began to sweet talk me. I saw the meat smoker, which was a huge turn on! The sides were open exposing delicious pink meats being slow cooked right in front of my eyes like a sexy dance! I also saw the real wood stacked out back below a large tree with branches full of REAL LIVE chickens... yes I said chickens! (BTW the way, did anyone else know chickens climb trees or am I still inside the Matrix?) As a final act of foreplay, the interior decor was just right, like candles burning around a hot bubble bath. It had that seductive gritty down home feeling I like when enjoying BBQ. The only thing missing from this BBQ romance was blues music playing live!\n\nThe chef allowed me to sample several items since I just couldn't decide what I wanted my sides to be. They'd run out of mac n' cheese, which would have been my first preference, however, the collard greens and chicken n' rice were amazing! This took my BBQ expectations even higher as I anticipated a foodgasm once I got my hands on the pork ribs I ordered. Unfortunately, this romance was not meant to be.\n\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nThe ribs were smoked to the point of tasting like cigarette ashes. I've learned since being  an active yelper than many people crave this type of smoky flavor, but it was just too much for my extremely picky BBQ palette. I would much rather have well seasoned meat with just a kiss of smoke than eat meat that should probably have a surgeon general warning label!\n\nI also don't care for BBQ sauce. If the meat is well seasoned, to me sauce is unnecessary. Yet I found myself drowning these ribs in sauce to hopefully compensate for the ashy flavor. I emptied an entire table bottle on my order, and still with little desire to eat them, I threw away my leftovers later that evening. Other items to my disliking include the potato salad and baked beans. Growing up my mother used brown sugar to sweeten her beans and that is the flavor I'm used to, but these beans tasted of syrup or molasses, which I did not enjoy. They were also practically as thick as peanut butter.\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nI'm not sure why people find this place to be worthy of 5 stars, but I most definitely do not. This brief encounter felt very much like being in a relationship where everyone tells you how great the person is before you meet them. When you finally do meet them, they are presentable, attractive and say all the right things. However, in the end, they just don't perform!\n\nI'm breaking up with you Al's Finger Licking Good Bar-B-Que I didn't lick my fingers, not even once.\n\n\nSIDE NOTE - This review should really be a 2.5, but I really liked the staff. They were accommodating, hospitable and kind. Not to mention the chicken n' yellow rice was simply amazing! So I have chosen to round up instead of down.\n\n\n2016/4",

  "text": "I have never been to a barber before. I dyed my hair and beard so I used to go to a salon. I went on vacation to Orlando and I visited my first barber ever. I was amazed so as soon as I got back to Indy I decided to look for a barber. It took me 3 barber shops later (not great experiences) and I ended up at Commisary recommended by at least 6 people and telling me : get Phil Get Phil !!! \nSo I was like fine I'll get Phil. First of all Phil is booked like 2 months , and I was thinking that could be very good or very bad. I finally got an appointment. That was about six months ago. Since that first haircut Phil has been my barber every other week. I mean .. not even kidding. And sometimes I even go once a week. The feeling of professionalism is outstanding. You can see the people coming out of the barber shop looking Sharp!!!\nEveryone is extremely cool , they are all super good and you feel always very welcomed. My hair is always on point , my beard is perfect!! \nAnd is a plus you can have a Espresso or a beer there . \nCons:\nThey don't do color , I tried everything to convince them . So I still go to the salon to get my color and then I get my haircut there. Doesn't bother me. Still worth it.",

  "text": "This place advertises thirty-minute oil changes. So I made an appointment for 9am. Three hours and fifteen minutes later they were finally done. Need I say more? Okay, I'll break it down for you. I arrived at my 9am appointment about five minutes early. The person at the service desk said, \"It'll be just a couple of minutes. I've got a mechanic who is finishing up and you'll be next.\" So far, so good. Unfortunately, that's where the 'so good' ends. One hour and fifteen minutes later, finally, a mechanic comes to the parking lot to get my vehicle. He backs out of the parking space, and starts forward. A person from the service desk comes outside and stops the mechanic. After a brief conversation, the mechanic pulls my vehicle back into a parking space, gets out, goes inside and gets the keys and paperwork to another  vehicle, and pulls it in and works on it. To make matters worse, when the mechanic pulled my vehicle back into a parking spot...it was a handicap parking spot. There is nothing about me, or my vehicle that's handicapped. it disgust me when I see people parking in handicap space when they are not handicap. Yet, my vehicle sits in a handicap space thanks to the mechanic, who was pulled out of my vehicle to work on another. What happened to, \"You're next\", and \"It'll be just a couple of minutes\"? At this point, I'm about to 'blow a gasket', as the saying goes. Rather than create a disturbance inside their business, I decided to take out my frustrations here at the keyboard. So here I am. Besides, I wanted to see how this played out. At no point did anyone from the service desk call me to the counter, or come to me in the waiting area and apologize for the long delay. After more than two and a half hours, they finally pulled my vehicle in. At the three hour and fifteen minute mark, they were finished...and so am I. I will never return to this place, for any reason, as long as I live. Their website, and signs on the door advertise thirty-minute oil changes. Not true. Lastly, I will say that if you need an oil change, do not ever, never ever, go to Pep Boys. I would go to Jiffy Lube, or Valvoline. Hell, I can get a faster oil change at the dealership. It's interesting to note that there were customers who came in after me, got their vehicles worked on, and were able to drive away before me. And I had an appointment!",

  "text": "When I tell people in Philadelphia that I'm Greek-American, invariably one of the first questions I'll get is \"What's your favorite Greek restaurant in Philly?\" which is quickly followed by \"What do you think of South Street Souvlaki?\" I have always been at a loss to answer either because I don't eat out often, and when I do it's almost never at a Greek restaurant. Also, as a vegetarian, I just wouldn't go to a restaurant whose name celebrates meat. \n\nSo when my friend Brad mentioned that he'd heard about a new Greek restaurant and would I check it out with him, I was immediately interested. From the initial reviews it sounded legit, more like the food I'd grown up eating at home rather than Greek food catering to American tastes (the many complaints about the lack of lettuce in the Greek salad were a good sign). The menu does still lean more towards the preferences of meat-eaters (gotta give the market what it wants) but there are several vegetarian options. No fish entrees, which seemed like a pretty major omission for a Greek restaurant, but the garidomakaronada sounds like the shrimp Santorini I used to love, which isn't something you find often. \n\nBut anyway, for my first visit the seafood test was the xtopodi (grilled octopus). Because if a Greek restaurant can't do THAT well, it'll never be great. The verdict? It has potential, but I have to admit it's not the way I'm used to having Greek-style octopus. Usually it's cut into pieces (thus more thoroughly cooked), and here the tentacles were served pretty much intact. The flavors were right though, and maybe this is the way it's actually served in Greece? It's tasty so still worth getting, but it's a huge portion so you probably want to have at least 4 people in your party who love octopus if you're going to order this.\n\nI chose the spanakopita as an entree, and that was definitely excellent. The pita was clearly house-made (not ready-made phyllo-dough) and delicious, and the spinach filling was really well done. This definitely stacked up against plenty of the better homemade spanakopita I've had. Brad got the meat-eater's version, the kreatopita (which had chicken, pork and lamb). I've never seen that in a Greek home or restaurant before, so I'm guessing this was made, again, for American tastes. But it must work, because he liked it. Both dishes came with the horiatiki salad - yes, this is what Greek salad is supposed to be like!\n\nMoving beyond the menu, the decor reminded me a lot of the more minimalist Greek tavernas I've been to, though still with a good dose of Greek art and elements (wall tiles, prints, statuettes, etc.) I could heard traditional Greek music over the loudspeaker but the noise level mostly obscured it - the restaurant was PACKED. Lots of big parties, families, etc. Everyone seemed like they were having a great time, and the hosts and servers ran around frantically to make sure that was the case.\n\nSo I'm happy to now know a great Greek restaurant in Philly! Well, close enough - a Philly suburb. Since most of the Greeks I know seem to prefer the suburbs anyway, this actually makes sense. In the meantime, I still need to find a good Greek restaurant in the city itself (eventually).",

I hope people understand that that they are making moves with how packed they are, I even had a guy who was hanging out drinking and was helping a friend bus tables.. \nIf you go at night the menu is limited but that's ok! Get the whole fried chicken and all the sides and you won't be mad! \nThe chicken is cooked to perfection! And had this seasoning on it that is sweet and spicy and I wish I knew what is was, but it tastes great! \nHash brown waffle is to die for! The hatch Mac is the right amount of spice and the Brussel sprouts were seasoned and charred in just the right way.\nCan't wait to go back to try lunch foods",

Interesting layout as they have a second ring of 4 toppers AROUND the central bar. We got our first waters within 5 minutes of sitting without asking. Within 3 more minutes, our waitress appeared for drink and appetizer orders. Got our wines, (Xplorador, Chile) my glass was dirty and the pour was below my normal expectation of a normal pour. Didn't say anything. Appetizers come next. Got the slab cut maple bacon and the \"famous for\" shrimp cocktail. OUTSTANDING!!! If Ur a bacon and spicy shrimp cocktail lover, you MUST get this. WARNING: shrimp cocktail is NOT inexpensive. Waitress returns to ask if I want another glass of wine. Yes, I'm running low at this point. I tell her about the dirty glass and the \"poor\" pour. She says she'll tell the bartender. Glass arrived poured about 3/4 FULL! Now, THAT'S what I meant by a good pour! Main dishes come. We got the St Elmo's Prime Rib sandwiches with house onion rings and cut fries. The onion rings came with a spicy ketchup/cocktail sauce-VERY good! The sandwiches were excellent.  The meat was super tender and tasty. U could easily bite thru the meat after dipping in the au jus sauce. I liked the creamy horseradish sauce better tho. I ask for the bill. No room left for dessert. $110.00 pre tip for 3 glasses of wine, two appetizers (shrimp cocktail $35.00 alone) and 2 entrees. The servers were all attentive, the food VERY good, but the price I thought a tad on the high side.",

Luckily, I work just a few blocks away so I have plenty of opportunities to purchase the delicious smoked meats before or after work despite residing in South Philly!  \n\nThe dude who works the front at this place is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodates customers to the best of his ability.  That alone makes me more motivated to frequent this spot.  You will always get personal treatment here whether it is your first visit or if you have been a long time customer.  \n\nOh, and the smell of the delicious smoked meats...I swear, I could wait in line forever if necessary as long as I can smell that smokey goodness all around me as I prepare to make my purchase.  Just imagine, the food you purchase will actually taste even better than it smells.   \n\nSo far, I have tried the bacon, kielbasy (garlic and breakfast to be specific since there is a great variety of kielbasy to purchase), and pierogies (3 cheese and the loaded potato types, to be specific as well).  \n\nBest bacon ever.  I love the places I frequent in the Italian Market in Philly and back home in rural NC, but the best bacon I've ever had in my life came from Czerw's.  \n\nWithout even being asked, the guy at the front took time to tell me the best way to cook the kielbasy and pierogies as he rang up my order.  He seemed invested in making sure I truly had the best possible food experience with the delicious Polish goods that I purchased. \n\nI have never been disappointed with this place.  If you are in this neighborhood, then definitely make a stop at Czerw's.  Check out the history of the place too by taking a look around at the pictures on the walls.  \n\nOh yeah, check this place out on the most recent episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, too.\n\n*Edit*\n\nThey totally welcome phone calls if you want to order anything by phone and pick it up later in the day.  This place will often sell out of items, such as the bacon.

  "text": "So... I'd been to Kuzina a few times for lunch and thought it was OK so I went for a late dinner with my boyfriend last night. He's not a connoisseur of foreign foods so Greek was not familiar to him. I was excited to introduce him to the cuisine and know how delicious it can be, but was pretty disappointed by well, everything we got. The greek salad had a minimal amount of feta and WAY too many salty items on it. Olives - ok, that's pretty typical. Capers? well, sure whatever. but you cannot put olives, capers AND anchovies on one salad.. it's just too much. not to mention they were SO clearly canned anchovies which is kind of just gross.\n\nSecondly - we ordered the moussaka to share. I cook, and recently I took a stab at making moussaka myself. it was delicious, so i figured most greek restaurants would make it even better. Also - i thought it was kind of like lasagna which my bf likes, so I knew it'd be a hit. Well? not so much. It came with a side - we chose the green beans which were soggy and covered in what seemed like canned tomato sauce. And of course, then there's the actual entree. It was like a ground beef stew with eggplant mixed in.. ok normal enough there - but then it came with a literally 1/2\" layer of HARD THICK unappealing bechamel \"sauce\" (if you can call it that) on top. It seemed like it had been prepared a long time ago and was just heated up. And it was disgusting. When the waitress saw that we didn't eat much of it, she didn't say anything. I did - I told her it wasn't very good, that I know moussaka and this wasn't too great. I acted like I liked the salad so she wouldn't feel like all was lost.. but it didn't matter, she didn't really care. It was late and very clear that she just wanted to go home. \n\nThe worst part of the whole experience... my boyfriend and I both feel totally sick today, so we know SOMETHING in that disgusting meal had gone bad. We will not be back.",

  "text": "I had Wild Eggs in Louisville several years ago while visiting a friend, and when I saw the building sign pop up off of 31 on my daily commute from work, I think I immediately began salivating.  I've been anxiously awaiting a visit once they opened, and I wasn't disappointed.  I went with a friend and we opted to share a savory and sweet dish.  We got the buffalo chicken omelet and cinnamon roll.  The buffalo chicken wasn't what I would typically order, but it was scrumptious.  It basically tasted like the buffalo chicken dip you have at parties, but made with an egg and hot sauce.  Hello!  The cinnamon roll was large and perfectly soft in the center.  Yum yum yum.  I can't wait to go back and try more options.",

  "text": "Great location, a quick walk to the Circle Center Mall. Close to Lucas Oil Stadium as well. Hotel was very clean, rooms were beautiful with high-ceilings and were very spacious. Each room has kitchen, microwave, large fridge, kitchen table, stove, sink, paper towels, plates. etc. Great for families. We had a nice view of the city from our hotel room. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of options. Fitness center was small but nice and clean and had standard hotel equipment with one elliptical, one treadmill, free weights, etc. Hotel is close to several restaurants. Kilroy's (bar/restaurant) delivers to the hotel, it is also right next to the hotel, therefore we walked a couple feet, and enjoyed a good dinner there. \n\nValet parking is the only option at this location and was pricey. We wanted to leave our car there until 3pm but had to take it out by 1pm or we would be charged for another day of valet parking ($30 bucks/day). This was inconvenient as other hotels have not charged us for staying in their lot 2-3 hours after checkout. \n\n\nOtherwise, staff and valet workers were very attentive and nice. Had a decent experience overall and this would be a nice hotel to stay at again in Indianapolis due to its great location downtown and proximity great shopping, restaurants, and Lucas Oil Stadium.",

  "text": "After driving by a million times (give or take a couple), we finally stopped here on a Friday evening for a quick dinner, and we are now fans. \n\nBased on Yelp reviews we ordered the Bavarian pretzel with Obatzda, the wurst platter and the mussels in beer.  The house-made pretzel had a thick, chewy exterior which was the perfect foil for the richness of the Obatzda.  The deliciousness was further enhanced by Mr. M's micro-brew and my light and bubbly hard cider.   I would have been content to stop right there.  \n\nMr. M ordered the wurst platter, which he declared excellent (not a surprise given the distinguished pedigree of the wurst).  What really sold him on the meal, however, were the handcut fries and spaetzle, which recalled Mom's recipe.   The mussels were uber-delicious (and comparable to Monk's), and only the rules of decorum prevented me from slurping the remaining broth. \n\nWe loved the intimacy that the low-lighting created in what is not an intimate space.  The service was attentive, efficient and patient with newbies.",

Bar was moderately crowded but extremely loud for the amount of people. Drinks were mediocre at best. Sazerac was underwhelming and Moscow mules were some of the worst I've experienced in Nashville. For the price I'd expect them to be on par with Morton's or the Oak Bar. \n\nSat on time, but took longer than expected for waiter to approach table. After trying the pickles and bell peppers, the bread came which was delicious. We decided on the smoked salmon and bacon as an appetizer. I must say the bacon may have been the highlight of the meal. It was deliciously prepared with a great sauce. Salads arrived and contained surprising delicious tomatoes, especially for the time of year. Going into the entree I had high expectations. However  my ribeye, although prepared fantastically visually (medium rare) lacked the flavor I typically expect from the cut of meat. My wife ordered the shrimp pasta which even though the shrimp was cooked well, lacked flavor. The best part of the meal was probably the skillet fried potatoes and gravy... absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall not a bad experience, but for the price and ambiance I'd much rather go to one of the other steakhouses in Nashville. Definitely worth checking out, if for nothing else then to reaffirm your favorite restaurant.",

  "text": "I'm not much for writing reviews on Yelp; I usually only read others. However, I had such a terrible experience with this company that I actually feel obligated to write one (even though there isn't a single positive review anyway).\n\nI was in Santa Barbara for a dear old friend's wedding this past weekend. SIx of us needed to take a cab from our rental home to the Four Seasons. I called at 5 PM asking for a cab to pick us up at 5:40. The woman rudely informed me that they don't take orders for cabs in advance. Surprised, I said okay, and that I would call back in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later, I called back and asked for two cabs. The woman remembered me and was incredibly rude asking for my address and phone number. She said they'd be there \"momentarily.\" We used the opportunity to take some photos of us all dressed up for the wedding, but at 5:45 realized the cab was STILL not there (I had called at 5:20). We started to panic; I called back and the woman told me that the cabs were \"dropping off other customers\" and would be there in \"around 15 minutes.\" I was VERY peeved and said we would have to cancel our cab. We ended up having to drive ourselves to the wedding and leaving our cars at the hotel, meaning we had to go pick them up in the morning. It was so frustrating, considering we were only trying to be safe by taking a cab so that we could all drink comfortably. \n\nThis woman knew that I was trying to plan in advance, yet was incredibly incompetent and rude. I have worked in many different types of service industries and have never treated anyone with such disrespect, even if they were being rude. I can honestly say that I was not being short, rude, or annoying in any way, and yet she treated me with complete disregard. I wish I had gotten her name so that I could call the manager/owner, but based on other reviews it seems that this is not a good cab service at all. \n\nPlease take my advice and don't use this company. They are incompetent and incredibly RUDE!",

  "text": "This place is full of one health code violation after another! Originally when this place first opened up me and my coworkers raved about how good their burgers were! One day things happened to take a turn for the worst! My meat was tough and drenched in so much oil that the bread fell apart. They changed their fries from shoe string cut, to zig zag, and now to this thicker cut and none of them were ever crispy. I've asked them in the past to place my fries in a bag to keep them from getting soggy and eventually they started doing all of their orders like that, but now even in the bags they're still soggy. After not ordering from them for a few months my coworker and I went against my better judgement and decided to give them another try. By now hoping things may have gotten better plus I've never been to the actual location before. Before leaving my office I ordered my food on my Grubhub app. My office is 10-15 mins away plus we stopped to go to CVS for a good 20 mins so I figured that was ok because it's next door to the restaurant yet my food still wasn't ready once I got there. As I waited my coworker went and ordered a slice of pizza. They were busy so I waited and I waited in horror! The staff was all over the place and not a single glove was worn in site! I watch one employee take a rag and wipe food, paper and some rolls to the edge of the cutting board so he could prepare a pizza. That wasn't before he took that same rag and tossed it onto the roll which another employee proceeded to make sandwiches with! Next an older woman began making sandwiches along with the other young lady and because she was short she couldn't properly reach some ingredients she needed. She then proceeded to lean over the cutting board boobs mashed completely against the sandwich and once she had what she need she proceed to finish making the same sandwich! Mind you NOBODY was wearing ANY GLOVES! Between that and the pizza man rubbing his ungloved hands on his nose while making pizzas the cashier woman finally asked me had I been helped. I hesitated because I was in a state of shock but told her no and gave her my name. She couldn't find my food so I waited some more....Now I started looking at the food on the floor and then my eye began to watch the man on the grill. Jesus Christ where do I begin...well for starters a lot of cross contamination with the meats. Beef, steak and chicken prepared in the small spot on the grill and shoved off to the side. Cheese sat in a metal pan next to the grill melting and clearly not kept at the temperature it should be. I found out why my burgers have been so oily it was because the man was pressing the meats so hard against the grill cooking out all of the natural oils and grabbing this bottle of oil dumping it all over the meat. After waiting over 20 mins, my coworker asked if our food was ready. We were advised that her pizza was forgotten in the over and that my order wasn't anywhere to be found. I was finally able to get someone's attention and asked them to cancel my order because I couldn't stomach it. The young lady was ready to give me a refund and this old woman started yelling at her \"I told you her order was ready! The bag is right here!\" all while she's slamming my bag of food on the counter. The young lady still being polite says she didn't know and the old woman has now marched towards the kitchen and is yelling towards the girl speaking to a guy who I believe was the manager. I whispered to the girl \"If you're going to get in trouble for this then don't worry about it I'll just take the food\" she apologizes again and I got out of there. I get to work and the fries are soggy, the burger is burnt, tasteless, full of oil and the lettuce were wilted. I threw the whole bag out and proceeded to write this review...I will never go to this dump again!",

He offered to replace the battery if it fails to hold a charge and promised to speak to his team. \n\nWe dropped my wife's car off to get painted after some gravel damages. After a while of it being there we were finally able to pick up (insurance company kept delaying and avoiding communication). We arranged to pick it up on June 2 2020. We showed up an hour and half before closing time and the car was still not ready so we had to wait until 1200 the following day. When we showed up at 330pm, the vehicle was still not washed (that's why we couldn't pick it up the prior day) so we had to wait a few minutes for that. We drove off to get some prescriptions filled. When we tried to leave the pharmacy the car was dead. Turns out the battery died from sitting so long and they had to jump it to bring it around to us. They never told us this. Now it's 4pm and 89 degrees outside and we are trying to get a car started. When we called they just said that they were sorry for not telling us. I wanted to speak to a manager and was told he wasn't in and would call me first thing in the morning. It's now 120pm with no phone call. I'm very disappointed at the lack of communication from this company to their customers. They put my wife and I at risk by not telling us the car battery is dead and should be driven a while before turning it off. The only thing that makes this whole situation worse (disclaimer: they didn't know) is that we just spent 4 hours in the ER for a back injury of mine and now I'm out trying to move around under a hood).",

It's truly been a beautiful thing to watch and be a part of their vision come to fruition. \n \n \nThey have 2 other wineries in this location that do just about the same thing. I have had the honor meeting the owners as well and are very nice and can't wait to try some of their creations as well. Nevada Sunset was the first one to open so I have a little more experience with them than others.",

  "text": "The Rocky Statue and the Rocky Steps are one of the most famous attractions in Philly, both located at the Philadelphia Art Museum. \n\nBefore Rocky III came out, Sylvester Stallone had his character, Rocky Balboa made in bronze. Originally this statue was placed at the top of the stairs of Philadelphia Art Museum for the movie and then left there as a gift from Sylvester Stallone. However the museum did not consider this to be art and more of a \"prop\" from the movie and refused to allow the statue to be kept here. So eventually this statue was placed at the bottom of the stairs, to the right of the museum, where it lays now. \n\nWith both arms raised, this statue gives that feeling of hope since Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa was that underdog who took on the boxing champion of the world and went all 15 rounds in Rocky I. What a movie!\n\nJust as other fellow Yelp members had mentioned, there will most likely be a line to get a photo with this free attraction, any time of the day (even if the weather is not the most desired). But the line does move kind of quickly. Although you do see some people over do it and take more than a few photos with the statue, which will hold up the line. We saw several people doing that, which was a little annoying. \n\nBut anyways, definitely a nice keepsake photo for your travels.\n\nPlease note that if you decide to come here, there is limited street parking. Right at the bottom of the museum are loading zones only so just be sure to be aware of the signs so you don't get a ticket.",

Once had finished the exercises, Dr. Davis realized that I was suffering from Tendinosis, basically a drawn out version of tendinitis.

I asked for no chicken, so I only got the falafel, which was excellent (except it was doused in that overly spicy sauce that leaves a gasoline taste in your mouth for hours). And who serves pasta with falafel? The fresh greens served on top were delicious. I'm not sure what they were but they were yummy. Also, the red grapes sprinkled throughout were a great touch and added a succulent, sweet taste to the dish.\n\nThe guys in the truck were so friendly and nice, and I know a lot of people love this truck, but I wish the food preparers gave you a little more control over what you want. They do seem a little Soup Nazi-esque in that regard.",

  "text": "I love, love, love this place! I always try to stop by whenever we are in Philly, we actually came here a few times from NY just to have dinner here.  Did I mention that I love this place?  My ultimate goal is to try all of the dishes on the menu, which has been difficult as I always order the same 2-3 dishes each time.  See below for the dishes I have tried, which are ranked based on my preference:\n\nPrah-Hok Kateeh - My absolute favorite dish and I have to order it every time I come here.  It doesn't look much in pictures, but trust me, you will love it.  It is basically ground pork that is flavored to perfection and you eat it with an assortment of vegetables.  I can eat this dish everyday!  Actually Khmer Kitchen inspired me to try to replicate this dish at home, I have tried a bunch of different variations of this dish using recipes from the internet, and none have even come close to the ones served here.\n\nSah-Law Machue Yuin - Another dish that I always order. It is a sweet and sour soup that comes with either chicken, fish or shrimp.  My personal favorite is the fish version.  Due to the fact that there are no Cambodian restaurants in NYC, I try to order a similar dish when I go to Vietnamese restaurants, but needless to say, none have come close to this dish.  I love the fresh pineapples (most other places use canned ones), and the gourd melon, which I have never had before I came here, now I love it!\n\nCha Throp - stir fried eggplant that comes with either pork or chicken.  I love the pork version, the pork just melts in your mouth.  The flavor could be similar to eggplant with garlic sauce from Chinese restaurants, but Khmer Kitchen uses big pieces of perfectly flavored pork instead of group pork, which I think makes a huge difference\n\nCha Mussels - The sauce for this dish is out of this world.  True story, my friend actually took the leftover sauce to go so that she can eat it over rice for lunch the next day, no mussels, just the sauce.  The mussels are great too, but the sauce this the star of this dish, and I kind of wish they serve bread with this dish so I can sop up that delicious heavenly sauce.\n\nPleah Sak-Koe- It is basically a rare beef salad.  For people who are a bit squeamish about eating rare beef, this is probably not the dish for you. For the more adventurous eaters, give this a chance.  It is super refreshing, particularly during the summer.  Could be a bit spicy, so be forewarned!\n\nSah-Law Machue Kr'ung - another soup with either chicken or beef.  I liked the aforementioned sweet and sour soup better, but this one has my favorite protein, i.e. beef.  The beef is super tender and flavorful.  I picked out all of the beef while everyone else was busy talking (no, that's not rude at all)\n\nKuh-Puh Ch'in - Shrimps that are lightly battered and fried to perfection.  I am not a huge fan of shrimp, but if I have to eat shrimp, I would eat this any day.\n\nCha La-Pauh - stir fried pumpkin with either chicken or pork.  I don't like pumpkin, but the pork in this dish is so yummy.  I had to be sneaky and pick out the pork as I did with the previously mentioned soup.  Everyone that liked pumpkins at the table raved about this dish.\n\nCha Kr'ung - stir fry dish with celery and pepper, comes with either chicken or beef.  It was just ok, nothing too spectacular to report.  \n\nCha Lok-Lak - my least favorite dish.  It is basically beef cubes on a bed of lettuce.  Perhaps I should've dipped the beef in the sauce longer, but it is not as flavorful as the rest of the menu.\n\nThis is a family restaurant with the mother and grandmother in the back cooking, and coming here feels like going home to mom's cooking, well if your mom is Cambodian and an amazing cook.  The waiter is super friendly, I assume he's the son/grandson to the chefs.  He's always very patient in answering whatever questions we have, and always accommodating with all of the annoying requests I have (i.e. more vegetables for the Prah-Hok Kateeh, more napkins, takeout containers for the leftover sauce).  The only downside is that the hours can be unpredictable, so definitely call beforehand.  I have been disappointed numerous times because they had to close early, or open late for various reasons, as I don't live in Philly, I couldn't wait around for them to open.  It has been a running joke between us that we are 'lucky' if the place is actually open when they say they would.  However, they have a loyal customer in me, I will come back here again and again!",

  "text": "OK, I lied.  I decided to give this place another try. In all honesty, I drove by Acajutla to go to another Mexican restaurant but I found that one to be closed. So, last time I came here, the soup was good enough to allow me to convince myself that I may have ordered the wrong entree. Here we go again.\n\nI ordered the Tortilla soup again. It was even better this time. This stuff is delicious. It really isn't worth $6.99 but what bowl of soup can be. I must admit, this is as close to being worth it as you get. It has a little feta, cilantro, avocado, onion and chunks of chicken in a slightly spicy broth.   This is a must for any new customer.  I'm sure it will hook you.\n\nI decided to have the Combonation plate and a side of re-fried beans. The combo had a beef taco, chicken fajita, chicken tostada and a deep fried thing with potatoes and pork in it called a pastel. Kind of like a really big perogy that was deep fried. \nThe chicken tostada was delicious. With re-fried beans, chicken, lettuce, cheese and egg it was definitely the best thing on the plate. The crisp taco on the bottom made it almost impossible to eat but the flavor kept me trying.    \nThe beef taco was chunks of steak and onion on a soft shell. It was good, but plain. I was impressed that it was actual chunks of steak instead of ground beef. I added some Pico de Galo and dipped it in my beans and it made it pretty good. \nThe chicken fajita was ok but I could have done with out the pastel. It didn't taste terrible but for as bland as it was, I'm not sure my cholesterol spike was worth it. \nI don't know what the spicy vinegar cabbage is called but it seemed to be \"Mexican cold slaw\" if there is such a thing. It was quite nice.  I enjoyed it so much that I have tried to duplicate it at home, with out any luck I might add. \nThe plate didn't come with re fried beans so I ordered a side. They looked like paste, but they were very good. I like the beans to be baked a little and with melted cheese and these were neither. \nAll in all, this place was ok. If I'm in the area I will probably try it again.",

However, you miss the point, my husband called and spoke to Roger at 9.15 am to see if the car was available and was told it was. Any decent person with integrity and honest business practices would have told the person who bought the car later that morning as we were driving up to purchase it in cash, that someone else was on the way and would have offered that person first refusal in the event that the sale did not go through. Roger left a message when we were 10 minutes away that it had been sold. Then, instead of apologizing for being the unscrupulous shark that he is, proceeded to tell us it was our fault for driving so far. \nIt is interesting that most of the complaints on YELP and other review sites mention Roger, specifically by name.

My taste test determined that they were both really good, cheesy and scrumptious, but I found that the Acme oysters were a little bigger, and relied less on the cheesiness and focused instead on overall flavor.\n\nIn addition to the oysters they are famous for, Acme Oyster House has a good selection of New Orleans treats. My boyfriend went for the Fried Fish Po-Boy which he thought was pretty good and said he would come back for.\n\nOn the side, he ordered some French Fries. They were blah and he said he would order a different side next time.\n\nI ended up eating Red Beans & Rice. I thought it was delicious. It reminded me of something we eat in Jamaica called Stewed Peas.\n\nThe food was exceptional, as was the service. Our waitress was very friendly, engaging in conversation and making sure we were comfortable. Not sure if it was her doing or the chef's but the half dozen chargrilled oysters came with seven instead of the six, but it was awesome.\n\nAcme Oyster House seemed to have edged out Drago's in more ways than one, so if I ever have the craving, I am heading to Acme.",

I was saddened to see on this visit that the crab benedict had been taken off the menu and instead opted for the eggs and bacon basic breakfast.  My plate had several strips of thick cut bacon and eggs cooked perfectly, but their hash-browns could have used some seasoning oompf.  We were quickly seated, the environs were clean and spacious and the staff was accommodating.",

Do not miss this place if you're in Philly.  \n\nNote they are fine for the gluten intolerant, but it is not a gluten free establishment.  They are aware and will inform you of this: cross contamination could be an issue if you have a serious gluten allergy.",

The craft brewed soda could be a bit more flavourful and the pizza we had was good, but not worth the trip (this is way south for us). Still, the beer and atmosphere were good enough that we'll likely be back.",

  "text": "The premise is clean organic eating which I love!This establishment is counter service during the day and table service at night. First trip I had the Smoked Salmon & Scrambled BLT it was $14 and it was only ok. I drank the free water on the table. There was a lot of bread and I ended up eating the sandwich open-faced. I wish I had gotten a juice or smoothie to try but after $14 on a sandwich that wasn't an option this time. My coworkers ordered other meal options but no one was blown away. It was just ok.\n\nOn my second trip I came for dinner with my family because my sister loves this place and I have to say it has improved since opening. I got the chicken salad sandwich and hot cauliflower. I am in love and wish I could eat it everyday! \n\n I will say the ambiance was fabulous and this place is truly adorable! If you think you might be into it, I say just go for it and try to form your own opinions because you might like it more than I did.\n\nThere is EiO & The Hive parking right outside but it indicates that there is a 20-minute limit which doesn't seem like enough time.",

Our waitress was outstanding. We ordered  2 appetizers the flaming cheese saganaki... Amazing, and Tzatzikii which came with pita bread. Yummy yummy yummy!! I could have licked the bowl but my family would never have gone out to eat with me again. I got the chicken gyro platter... Loved it... it was so much food. It comes with fries and a Greek salad. Three people in our party got the regular gyro platter. Everyone of them had to get a take home box as well but they loved every bite... they wanted to eat more but felt they may have to roll out the door. The salmon was very good and she ate every bite of it! My nephew ordered the  cheeseburger and Greek fries and he was as satisfied as a teenage boy with a phone and a burger would tell me but there wasn't anything left on his plate   The waitress came through and put on the music and danced threw napkins up in the air and all over us yelling  OPA and dancing around the room celebrating my daughter. They threw plates into a aluminum bucket  braking them in Greek tradition yelling  OPA and clapping! And dancing! It was great fun and such a sweet surprise for my daughter. We will be back! The food was great the atmosphere was fun and the staff was so friendly!  ( also we were more than 6 feet apart from any other table ... we felt very comfortable)",

We had the black bean burger, which is served on a giant pretzel bun.  I ordered it with lettuce, onion, pickle, tomato on the side and they packed up the condiments in a foil packet, so the bean burger wasn't soggy.  We also has a cuban which was great, pretzel bites with cheese, french fries, onion rings, chicken wings, and pepperoncini dip.  The orders were all completed accurately, the food was delicious, and it was prepared quickly.  We called the orders in, and 20 minutes later they were ready to be picked up. The serving sizes were large. The pepperoncini dip was my favorite. Will definitely get food from there again when we are back in the area.",

He's the guy who plays the music to fill in the gaps of conversation while you fumble for words to say to the stranger who you've regretfully invited to eat with you, whom you've just met on Tinder, hoping for an escape from this nightmare you've found yourself in. \n\nAnd then it happens... the man at the piano plays a sweet tune that brings a smile to the face of your date. It's an oldie but goodie. She begins to sing along and you find yourself awkwardly smiling and looking around because you don't know how this is going to turn out.\n\nShe encourages me to sing along: \"You know the words!\" she says.  Of course I do, it's Journey... I hesitate.. she gives me a prod.. So I give in. \n\nFast forward 10 mins and we're at the piano, drinks in hand, arms around each other... and Marc, belting out tune after tune. An hour went by and the lights came on. It was the end of the night and I didn't want to leave.  I tipped Marc and took a card... and then gave the man a big hug. I think we connected that night.\n\nI just found his card in my jacket pocket. It's been almost year since I saw him, but now that I've found him here on Yelp I had to share my story, I can't wait to have another great night, sharing a piano bench with him. \n\nAs for the girl.. she took the midnight train going anywhere..",

The emails felt very personal and I liked how the customer service line also had their pronouns in their signature, they seemed very inclusive and welcoming. I emailed again a month later wondering where my book was because they said it should've been shipped that night I emailed before and they refunded me another 30% on my book and yet again had a long apology talking about the circumstances. They offered me a full refund if I wanted that instead even though they don't do refunds on my product typically.

  "text": "I am a regular at Zizzo's, because it has the best brewed coffee in town. I probably go at least 1-2 a week just for a 24oz large coffee for 2.50!! A delicious cup of coffee (or technically three) at this price is unbeatable.\n\nI'm definitely a coffee snob and I care deeply about the roasting. My husband is from Seattle and my mother travels quite often to Colombia. Zizzo's is my favorite because they always have a light roast, medium roast, and dark roast coffee of the day to chose from. \n\nLet's talk about light roast. I have a deep appreciation for light roast coffee for a couple of reasons. First, it has the highest caffeine content. Second, it's hard to do light roast that has a good prominent flavor. All of Zizzo's light roast coffees are amazing. I personally love the Mexican Altura and the Guatemala Antigua roasts.\n\nThe medium roast is the Santa Barbara blend and it's great too. A solid go-to. I'll occasionally get a dark roast, and have never been disappointed. Occasionally they have a Tanzania peaberry, and I can never pass that up.\n\nTheir food is okay(but delicious at their other location), the clientele are friendly, they love dogs, and I've never ever had bad service. Tammy is my favorite barista, she seems genuinely happy! \n\nThis was all about the brewed coffee, but their espresso drinks are also really good. I like the Mexican mocha the best. I don't recommend the biscotti, but the other baked goods are fine.\n\nThey also give my pup a dog treat, and that makes me happy!  I also forgot to mention they have a few great beers on tap, and a fun system where locals buy each other beers in advance and Zizzo's puts their names on the wall and what someone has purchased for them.",

If you're from the Northeast it's always a challenge to find a great deli sandwich.\n\nPickles plus has the real thing, their corned beef and or pastrami sandwiches are lean, carved thin and piled high on freshly baked breads, pumpernickel, or rye. Great, spicy deli mustard. Everything's home made. I love their home made potato salad, unlike other area deli's whose condiments come in pre made manufactured tubs.\n\nFridays I make a special trip for their homemade New England clam chowder. Nice and creamy with lots of clams.\n\nPickles plus has one of the best Greek salads I've tasted, it's huge. Very courteous servers who go the extra mile to ensure you're satisfied. I understand they have an excellent breakfast and that's what I'll try on this Sunday morning.\n\nLocated in Northwood plaza at McMullen-Booth and Enterprise Rd.",

I ordered 2 Raw Samplers for the table.  As I (the hostess of the dinner) was about to eat an oyster; I noticed a little worm moving on the inside of the shell.  I did not want to alarm my guests as they all ate parts of the sampler.. I gave the oyster to our server, Diego P and wanted to at least let the server know what was being served.  Not once did the manager stop by throughout  the course of our meal.  \n\nAs the checks were presented and after payment was taken, I asked to speak to a manager.  The GM claimed she stopped by twice, but didn't know who to approach about the situation.  This is completely false... The only people that stopped by were part of the service staff.   All I was looking for was an apology and a reassurance that the seafood is delivered fresh... She just continued to claim she stopped by the table...  \n\nThose little details in a guest's dining experience makes a big difference if to return or not...",

They're located in a nondescript shopping complex but you need to turn before you get to the sign otherwise you'll have to loop around.  The first time I went, I was not very impressed with their offerings or the atmosphere.  It was very hot and they did not have any ac (or so it felt like).  They've got maybe 5 tables and a bar, which can be kind of limiting if you're with a group of people.  I've been to 2 beer geek bakery pairings and have gone several times since then because their beer is very good and they usually have a pretty diverse selection.  I've actually never had the same beer twice there.  Most recently, I tried their saguaro patch, which was everything I could have hoped for in a sour beer.  They also have very good IPAs and ales each time I've been.  I would recommend them and currently they've got a pretty good deal on Groupon as well.",

  "text": "I had long marveled at the fact that Franklin was such a black hole for good coffee.  Starbucks was everywhere, good coffee shops had shut down, and even the few place you could go were mediocre at the very, very best.  Downtown was especially bereft anything resembling good coffee.\n\nSo, I was driving down Bridge Street, and I see \"The Coffee House,\" and suddenly, I realized that hope abounds.  To be fair, I do know that recently another coffee shop has opened downtown, but I hadn't been able to get a coffee there, so I'll call \"The Bubbly Gorilla\" to maintain anonymity.  I actually had stepped into the Bubbly Gorilla, but the line to the counter was practically to the door, and I just didn't have time.  This is not the establishment's fault, and I will get around to it whenever I have an hour to invest in downtown Franklin\n\nWith all that said, I do enjoy The Coffee House very much.  I could see it as a casual relationship whenever I am in the area, say as a local buddy I visit if I have time.  I go to see it whenever I am in town, maybe get a cup of coffee, but The Coffee House will never be my serious coffee relationship: it's just too far from where I live.\n\nWhen I made my order, the fellow that I had was competent, thoughtful, and considerate.  I'll be the first to complain about brain-dead  teenagers at making my coffee, but my experience did not reflect this problem.\n\nIt has a nice comfortable layout.  Various rooms for various purposes.  The record room was a really nice touch.  It's literally a room where people can listen to old albums.  Other dining areas were nice too.\n\nI will echo those who complain that the counter area is not well deigned.  There's just room to maneuver around if someone is standing at the ordering area.  It's a serious flaw, and they should really figure out a better solution.  The also use Bongo Java coffee, which is tasty, but I can get it very easily elsewhere.  So many places use Bongo Coffee in Middle Tennessee that a coffee shop trying to distinguish itself should really go a different direction.  That's just my opinion, though, and The Coffee House does still makes it very tasty\n\nFranklin was desperate for good coffee options, and it looks as though they're doing a lot better.  I can't wait to try the Bubbly Gorilla, but I already know that if it is a disappointment, The Coffee House at Second and Bridge is a great place to visit.  Do not ignore this place if you're in Franklin and like coffee.",

I went on a Sunday morning. They told us it would be a 30 minute wait, but they probably got us seated slightly faster. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was absolutely first rate. Everyone at my table loved their dishes. The coffee was excellent. Service was efficient (not overly friendly + got shit done). If you're not in a hurry, Sabrina's is well worth your time.

The wait for the food wasn't terrible.

  "text": "Great Food, TERRIBLE Service. \n\n23\n\nYes, 23. That's how many servers passed me in the 7 minutes after being seated before one came to my table (of course, some of them were actually serving).  That put the experience off to a bad start, what with my low blood sugar and all. I was about to walk out, feeling snuffed and ignored, more so when the table next to me was immediately greeted upon seating.  \n\nWhen the server finally arrived to take my drink order, things began to look up. The Wisconsin Cheddar Bites arrived and were excellent!  Hot. Crispy. Tasty. Not quite worth the wait (because the wait was so long) but still delicious, with a tasty, chunky Marinara.  \n\nBut then another 23 minutes of waiting for my main course and then they got it wrong. Once they finally got it straight, the manager brought it out herself, IT WAS GOOD!  Tasty. Fresh. And Generous. The Baby Backs were fall-off-the-bone good (but still had the silver skin on) and the BBQ Chicken was done just right. Their Honey BBQ Sauce is very good, but you'll want to ask for extra. \n\nVicky, the Manager on Duty, checked on things and seemed to care, but still the Service left so much to be desired. Unfortunately, I didn't have a Penny to leave for a tip.",

  "text": "We've been to the Blue Dog a few times, to both locations (in Chalfont and Lansdale) but as Lansdale had a beer we really wanted to try, we hit them up for some dinner.\n\nThe crowd was quite light, with several booths open so we made our way to one in the center of the restaurant and proceeded to take in the menus. The Blue Dog has a decent amount of pub food, but it's rather limited in variety. You won't find juicy burgers or the like on here -- the only burger I saw was on a pretzel roll. Also, no cheesesteaks (a Philly staple!!). The beer menu is pretty deceiving as well. You are handed this large menu with what looks to be about 40 craft beers on it and you think \"SCORE\" until you get to the point after the 11th beer and it says \"Coming Soon...\" *womp womp* and then there are arrows of ones coming soon pointing upwards. \n\nThe food was ok.  Not that it was bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  The French onion soup is perhaps the best I've ever had in awhile, but the sandwiches (I had the chicken italiano and he had the filet Panini) were loaded and soggy. There was no way you could eat it as a sandwich. I had multiple versions of fries on my plate, too (steak, regular, small .. very odd and inconsistent). I do have to say that our server was top notch and very helpful and attentive.  The dessert we had (homemade chocolate peanut butter pie) was probably the highlight of the evening. Very good but chunky (has nuts for those who aren't a fan).\n\nI believe the pub has a bunch of events throughout the week - we happened on Trivia night. I guess the locals enjoy it, I've been to better (Steppy's in E. Norriton on Wed.nights). The MC was a little too creepy for my taste and the questions weren't really trivia relatable - just stupid knowledge.\n\nAs for the take-out area, they have a lot of decent beers, many locals that are bottled. If you drink those in-house, it's a $2.50 upcharge per bottle.  You can also try Capone's in E. Norriton for some really great brews as well and I don't believe they have an upcharge for drinking in the restaurant.",

They require that you cancel by a certain point within the month for it to become effective for the upcoming month and you have to do it by signing paperwork in person. I was there once and the receptionist was struggling with someone on the phone about how they absolutely needed to cancel in person.

One table with about 10 people, and the other with about 18. Experience (as a patron and working at restaurants) tells me that, other than the obvious noise, food quality drops drastically when that happens as cooks struggle to get all the food out for that table at the same time, and other orders are either rushed through, or die in the window as they are ignored being the mountain of plates for the party. This is a good test of a kitchen, but let's keep an open mind. \n\nOur waitress Tiffany was very nice, friendly and helpful. She said she would put our order in before party which she did. Very nice. \nWe ordered the Texas cheese fries, and the grown up grilled cheese. I usually have the Monte Cristo but wanted to try something new. Had a Caesar salad for my side. \n\nWe ordered before the big party so our food got out fast. \nThe Texas cheese fries were great as expected. No complaints there. \nThe grilled cheese had roast beef in it, which tasted very bland and over cooked. The worst part was the cheese. It was sliced cheese which was by far not high end to say the least. \n\nCaesar salad was fine. Not bad, not great. \nThe croissant on salad was awesome and sadly the best part of the meal. \n\nNot sure we will return. Not good enough for the price and so many other great choices with a 3 mile radius.",

  "text": "I have been coming to Boyette Animal hospital for 4 years and I've finally decided to call it quits. I kept telling myself they were good enough because they are close to my house, have convenient drop-off and pick-up hours and they could usually work you in quickly on a Saturday if you had an emergency. But none of that outweighs their inept reception staff, long waits for scheduled appointments, long hold time on the phone, ridiculous fees for followup appointments, high prices for basic things like vaccinations, poorly trained vet techs that give you bad information, and doctors that don't communicate with one another and honestly, aren't the best in town.\n\nI usually see a different vet every time I visit (there are several on staff), so I have to bring them up to speed on my dog or cat's medical history every time I go. It's annoying. I could schedule my appointments with the same vet each time but their random hours don't work with my schedule so I have to go with whoever is available. In the course of 4 years, I've seen 6 different doctors. \n\nMy main complaint is the treatment. My dog developed a cyst-like wound in the pad of his foot about 2 years ago and was having trouble walking and had a lot of discharge from his eyes, like allergies. I brought him in and they treated him with antibiotics for the wound. The size of the cyst was reduced but it never went away. I kept bringing him back because the cyst would swell up, he still had trouble walking and his eyes still had discharge. After about a year and a half of antibiotic ointments and sprays, steroid shots and finally some anti-inflammatory medication, his foot was permanently mangled and his joints were shot. Three of his nails turned inward because of the cyst and he can't walk without a limp.\n\nFrustrated, I took him to another clinic. I was immediately told my dog was 10 pounds overweight and that was causing stress on his joints, making it hard for him to walk. After a full x-ray, it was determined he had degenerative joint disease and needed to go on arthritis medication. The vet recommended a homemade low-calorie, grain-free diet to help him lose weight and reduce the allergy symptoms. I was told the cyst in his foot could be surgically removed but the deformity was permanent. I would just have to continue to put ointment on the cyst when it came back. Most likely with the weight loss and arthritis medication, the foot would be less stressed and the cyst wouldn't be irritated. \n\nI've gotten far better results and much more reasonably priced care within one visit to Dr. Easom at Christina Animal Hospital in Mulberry than I have in the 4 years and dozens of visits at Boyette.",

  "text": "Overall Value:  Super crispy, juicy chicken at a reasonable price.  Far superior to Bon Chon and most other Korean Fried Chicken that I have had.  And they have a fairly large menu -  we will definitely come back to try some of the other items (and get more KFC, duh).  \n\nThe Food: We got the half chicken Korean fried chicken ($12.95), which you can get in two flavors - we got honey soy super spicy and sweet chili spicy.  We also got a tuna taco ($5.25), which they were nice enough to cut in half, they through in a free crunch ball (normally $2.75) because it was our first time visiting, and we got a medium matcha green bubble tea ($3.50).  The chicken was SUPER crispy and still very moist inside - it was phenomenal.  This was especially impressive because the half chicken isn't just wings or drumsticks - it's a half chicken that is cut into smaller pieces, so you are getting pieces of chicken breast too.  But these pieces were still impressively moist and flavorful as well (and I usually much prefer dark meat).  The sauces were both good, but my only complaint is the spice level on the super spicy was kind of weak.  If you are going to call something super spicy, it needs to have a bigger kick.  \n\nThe tuna taco was also quite good and had a really fresh flavor with the guac, cilantro, salsa, sour cream etc. A minor quibble is that because there is so much else going on in the taco, it overpowers the tuna a bit, but still good a decent size (it better be for over $5!).  The crunch ball was awesome.  Again, SUPER crispy outside and delicious filling with kimchi and rice, covered in flavorful sauce.  Matcha green bubble tea was delicious as always.  \n\nWe skipped out on fries because we thought it would be too much for two, but probably should have added fries to the order.  Half chicken wasn't quite big enough for the two of us, even with the taco and crunch ball (we eat a lot though).  We will go back to try the Korean Oven Chicken when that is available (there was a sign that said coming soon), and also try some of their many other dishes. \n\nService:  So friendly and helpful.  On top of giving us a free crunch ball, they also were patient with us and gave great recommendations for the menu, and let us sample the sauces.   \n\nSpace and Pace: Fairly large interior with plenty of seating.  We came on a Friday night around 7:30pm and it wasn't too crowded - great spot to meet up with friends and get some awesome chicken.",

Best part was when we arrived, we got a wonderful table outside right away.  The service was friendly, prompt and accurate.  The food is amazing.  My boyfriend is very picky about burgers and really enjoyed their burger!  I got the fried cod Banh Mi.  Being Vietnamese, I am a Bahn Mi snob.  Theirs was very good.  My only disappointment was the bread.  Don't get me wrong, the bread was delicious.  However, the most important part of an authentic Banh Mi is the bread and this just wasn't the right bread to use.  Nevertheless, it was delicious!  Although we sat outside, the interior of the restaurant is just as gorgeous.  This will be our go-to place for sure!  Great job and congratulations!",

The sashimi is sliced very thick, but I really don't mind as I slice it to my liking at home (take out) so that I get more pieces. :-)",

At Toast, in New Orleans, you may suffer from \"too much toast\" syndrome, but by suffer, I mean benefit greatly from... until you enter into a debilitating food coma 30 minutes after finishing your meal. I love toast (the bread). I love to toast (the bebidas alcoholicas). And I definitely love to Toast (eating brunch at Toast, the restaurant). All three of which, I can do at once, at Toast! On my recent visit there, I ordered the Croque Madame, and instead of the side salad, I substituted a side of bacon because... bacon! It was so good, and so filling, I couldn't finish my meal! I haven't tried the Aebelskivers yet, but can't wait to do so, along with pretty much everything else on their menu, to be honest...

She wags her tail and definitely has a pep in her step when she sees him. He knows her condition and is thoughtful enough to carry her up and down the stairs to the grooming salon (trust me she's not a small dog! She's around 45 lbs) and she always leaves very clean and smelling nice. he even takes time to put a cute bandana on her.\n\nI definitely recommend this location, if my dog was younger I'd definitely look into the daycare as I've heard great things about it.

Since I'm not too fond of the taste, I canceled my subscriptions. However, when canceling instead of it canceling right away, Snap kitchen charged me for another order. I called their customer service number to ask them for a refund and to stop delivery. Their customer service rep was not very empathic or concerned. I will now have to contact my credit card company to ensure they do not charge my credit card moving forward. \n\nDue to their lack of good customer service, I  would not recommend Snap Kitchen to anyone.

I highly recommend both specialty rolls and next time would opt for all specialty rolls since their menu had many more delicious options.\n\nAmbience was casual but nice...it was apparently the date-night spot for the two tables of first (or second daters) we were seated between. \n\nWhen I'm in Philly, this is definitely on my short-list of affordable eats, and I'd happily return.",

After psyching myself up to go bowling for the first time in years, I must admit I was a bit disappointed tonight that Splitsville was closed. \n\nI cannot blame Splitsville for only being open on select nights. After all, these Channelside businesses need to make some sort of profit. I only pray Jeff Vinik's bid gets approved by the end of this week so that there is some sort of revitalization of Channelside. \n\nWe plan on returning soon so I will need to stock up on my Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer and start mentally preparing myself again.

My friend and I were lucky to be the only ones that got the single person kayak and the rest were double riders. Some of my friends struggled with coordination so it's probably a good idea to let the staff know beforehand that you want a single rider. The swamp (Manchac Mystic) was beautiful! We learned a ton about alligators and other wildlife. We were lucky enough to go on a semi sunny day so we were able to see at least 4 alligators. I have to admit I was a bit scared at first but our tour guide advised us that 'gators are actually pretty dormant and since they're cold blooded, they try to conserve as much energy as possible. Also, the ones we saw were adolescents so they weren't too big. \n\nThe tour altogether was 2 1/2 hours and it was a great arm/shoulder workout but it won't completely burn you out. Make sure to take water, mosquito repellent, sun block, and cash for tip. I'd definitely try this again at Honey Island!",

  "text": "Nice interior design and decoration. Lovely mural and well customized menu. Great quality ingredients but the taste is a bit off balance. The deviled duck egg is too sour. The burger and fries are very salty. The risotto has a lot of veggies and taste rich and creamy. The barley can be less cooked so as to be much more chewy. \n\nVery curious about the brunch menu, so will come back and have a try. The staff there are very friendly, and kindly suggested that reservation for brunch would be a smart idea. \n\nOverall, the contradiction between trendy interior and heritage building gives unique feature of the place. A great place to grab a drink and chat with friends.",

I really appreciate how generous and concerned they were, and I think it reflects highly on Essenza's quality of customer service and care.\n\nJessica was able to remove the myriad of colors that were in my hair and even out the blonde without damaging my hair at all.

After the first tea I tried (I believe it was called African Honeybush) I needed to find out where I could get more of this tea!\n\nFirst, I googled Davidson's Tea and found their website which has a HUGE selection and many different options when it comes to what kind of tea they have and how many bags are in each box. I knew I wanted to get a variety so I could figure out which ones I liked the best. On the website they offered a tea \"sampler\" for each category of tea (black, green, holiday etc.). Each sampler has 40 tea bags and you could get three sampler boxes for only $20. Sign me up!!!\n\nI called the store here in Sparks to see if they offered the same price in store & the woman I talked to said everything that's offered online is also offered in store. I went in the next day and the two women that were working were so extremely nice and helpful. I knew I wanted white and green tea but I couldn't decide on the last box. They guided me to the honey tea based on my other two selections and I couldn't be more happy. \n\nEach of the three samplers has four different kinds of tea so I'm still slowing trying each one! I'm so excited and I can't wait to go back for more!",

The store itself is geared mostly towards \"women's wear\" with only a small selection of men's clothes near the front. It was interesting, sitting in the change room, watching female customers being doted upon with different sizes and being asked if they needed anything while I was relegated to do the running for my husband myself (which kind of sucked because I'm allergic to the elastic in most their clothes and left with red welts on my hands). I would have asked for help, but the \"changing hosts\" seemed content folding and chatting about staffing issues when they weren't helping the ladies.

Pulled pork was the runner up. Also tried pork brisket, beef brisket and sausage. \n\nThe sides were sadly all just meh.  The hot dishes were cold and cold dishes were lukewarm. We are big fans of bbq beans and we all agreed while the bean combo presented well, they lacked flavor. based on the servers suggestion, also tried- Mac and cheese, potato salad, collards, purple slaw, blue cheese slaw and fries. None were homeruns. \n\nService was super speedy. The sauces are impeccable! Our table polished off a full bottle of sweet sauce.\n\nNot sure I would drive over just for dinner again.

The outdoor patio right next to the rail were already slowly getting filled up with patrons. We were lucky to secure the last table right next to the rail. Our host was very nice and told us our server would be with us shortly.\n\nSure enough, our server popped in to get our drink orders. \n\nThe three of us shared a combination of things from the menu.\n\nWe ordered the Fried Clam with Tartar Sauce, She Crab Soup Bowl, Grouper Tamales, Super Cajun Grouper Sandwich with Fries (+$0.99 for fries to substitute chips), Tuna Poke Tacos.\n\nMy least favorite was probably the fried clams because of the inconsistency of batter to clam ratio. Some pieces were just pieces of batter. That being said, the clam pieces were delicious. \n\nThe grouper tamales were average. The grouper was delicious and so were the sauces they served with it: rojo and salsa verde. I didn't like the masa mixture. I thought it too thick and bland. \n\nThe she crab soup was delicious but super rich. I don't think I could have eaten the entire thing by myself so thankfully it was shared among the three of us. \n\nThe grouper sandwich was delicious and very flavorful. I wasn't a fan of the fries that came with the sandwich. They were cut way too fat and not crispy enough for my liking.\n\nMy tuna poke tacos were very flavorful. I really enjoyed the sweet thai chili sauce and cabbage slaw that was underneath the tacos. The fish was generously portioned. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered their Beer of the Month special which was $2.50 for a bottle of Banks Beer. He said the beer was watered down and not flavorful but considering the price, I wasn't surprised. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience and I can see why people love coming here. I loved sitting right next to the rail enjoying the oceanfront views.\n\nService was great. Our server got my tuna taco order wrong but was quick to fix the issue and apologize even though we ordered a lot so it's easily misunderstand as another dish on their menu.",

First of all they have much longer sessions available and the prices are great. Next, they actually do have you take off your clothes and they use oil, hot stones, hot towels and the like. It was seriously amazing. I had Jenny and I highly recommend her to you. Seriously seriously great place.",

You can't drive too far for delicious ice cream, and coming from Cincinnati, OH with Graeter's Ice Cream, great ice cream is something Philadelphia is missing. I'd give this ice cream a four-star rating, but the small business and Judy push it to a five. I had a hot fudge sundae with two flavors. It was delicious! A HUGE amount of ice cream, too. HUGE! The ice cream was pretty creamy and flavorful. The next time--and there will be a next time--I will try just some scoops of ice cream so I can really experience the texture and flavor. \n\nThis a definitely worth a visit for ice cream!",

  "text": "Couldn't go last year and luckily had time this year to attend. Came by with two other friends who likes avocados and although I'm warned it is a small festival, it was a bit larger than I imagined. However, I still think it's just an average festival.\n \nWith the main selling point as an avocado festival, I imagined all the stands or vendors would have at least one avocado themed food. Several of them did not. This was off-putting to see since I would imagine the festival is just finding vendors to fill up spots and grow while not staying to the purpose of the festival. Aside from that, the avocado theme things I tried were the avocado beer, avocado tri tip sandwich, holy-guacamole with salted chips, avocado ice cream, and sampled the avocado cream pie. Kind of wanted to try the deep fried avocado, but I saw someone carrying it and decided that it wasn't worth it for that price. As a sum, the food is pretty much basic festival food. The only creative ones I liked trying were the beer, ice cream, and cream pie. The beer is IPA based and not overly hoppy - an easy to drink beer. Although, the cream pie and ice cream are overpriced for the amount given. I definitely wouldn't consider getting them another try due to the price point. The tri-tip was nice to have and enticing due to the smell, but it was just plain store-bought guacamole instead of freshly made guacamole. The holy-guacamole was severely overpriced for what it's worth. Other items such as elote (in a cup as well), hot dogs, tacos, fish tacos, and etc were sold as well. Avocado brownies were sold out unfortunately.\n \nThere were two avocado sellers and they were severely overpriced. If you are fanatical about it, go for it, but I rather buy them elsewhere at more normal prices. \n\nThere were goods vendors on site as well as a ferris wheel. There were several stages for live music and the festival itself spans 2-3 blocks. At the non-beach end of the festival, there was an educational booth about avocados where I thought should have been the main attraction instead of the food vendors. I enjoyed seeing all the different varieties of avocados and reading up some history.\n \nAll in all, if you like avocados, you'll still come to check it out. Be ready for overpriced food and not enough seating of course. I definitely think 1-2 hour at most - depending on how large your group is and how willing you are to spend money to buy the food. I can't wholly recommend it as a popular attraction, but if you are close or visiting the area, it's worth a check. I wouldn't plan a trip with this solely in mind.",

Furthermore, they are a great asset to ensure all homeowners maintain homes in a consistent manner. However, in Concord Station, we have Terra Management as our management company. My communication with them has been poor and challenging. In 2017 countless emails and telephone calls went unanswered. Escalation attempts to the management at Terra went no where. Furthermore, recently, in the past 60 days, I experienced similar communication challenges. It is important you determine which management company a community uses before you buy a home there. That is because if you have a concern, I believe, communication with the management company is paramount. In the case of Terra Management, my experience is very poor and I do not feel this company understands and values communication",

  "text": "My response to Mark's reply:\n\nApart from the self-promotion, the fact remains that the work done is problematic at best. When discussing the AC, you offered it would suffice to flush the condenser, not replace it. Furthermore, it was the compressor a previous shop had recommended be replaced, NOT the condenser. Hence why we agreed to replace at some expense the compressor. \n\nWhen talking about these issues, I said to you, \"talk with your parts vendor and get back to me with some suggested resolution\" as it was obvious from the video I sent you the compressor was a defective part. In fact, you also added it wasn't the first time that had happened to you with this vendor.\n\nWhat you could do is refund the cost of the parts and labor for defective parts, poor communication and the incredible inconvenience caused us. That would be the level of customer service you claim to offer but lack here with this customer.\n======================================\n\nI'm not happy having to write a negative review, but really have no choice. Driving from LA to Mexico through Tucson, our truck developed excessive overheating and failed air conditioning. We contacted these folks, went in for an estimate, agreed to price and time, and waited for the repairs to be done. Along the way, we were shown a bad thermostat, junked up coolant/radiator water and cap. We agreed to replace liquids and parts, and the AC compressor \"kit\" at over $500 for parts alone.\n\nThe parts arrived late and the work was completed several hours later than what was stated. The AC blew cool, not cold air, so, we paid (with a \"new customer discount\"), and went on our way, headed to NM. It was evening at this point, so no need for AC and engine temp stayed within normal range.\n\nThe next day we crossed into Mexico and by 10:30am, we found the AC didn't work and the coolant was over flowing. Contacted them twice, phone and text, sent videos and pics, and asked for a suggestion for resolving, as we were deep into Mexico and not headed back to Tucson. Twice more the truck overheated to above normal levels through our trip requiring hour long stops and fluid replacement.\n\nAfter the initial contact, we have heard nothing back - it's now 2 weeks. AC still doesn't work, truck still overheats and looses fluids frequently (no leaks), and we paid almost $1000 for what turns out to be a huge mistake in having our truck \"repaired\" there. Perhaps more attention to quality control, results, and customer service after repairs would have saved us and them this negative review and further actions I know have to take.",

  "text": "Honestly, this place was a pretty big waste of time and money. My girlfriend, friends, and I went here for New Years last night.\nWe paid $85 to get in for an open bar which seemed fair before we arrived. When we got in, they had limited their bar to really cheap beers, a few alcohols, and pretty much no real mixed drinks. The bartenders there didn't even know how to make most drinks more complicated than rum and coke... The music was mediocre at best and there were some snack foods.\n\nThe most obnoxious part was when we decided that we could at least try to have a little fun hanging out and playing shuffleboard. The table had one of the end boards broken by some drunk girl about an hour earlier, but the table was still playable, so we just pushed the board back in and played. The bouncer came up and tried getting in our faces and blaming us about the table. Multiple people stepped in to let him know it wasn't us and then we asked if we could still play on the table since it wasn't going to get worse. He stayed being douchey and disrespectful to us and then the manager told us not to play on the table so that nobody else would get hurt. So we ended the night sitting down on the chairs and trying to get drunk off of the weak drinks they made at the bar.\n\nTL;DR Don't waste your time or money at this place, at least not for New Years. The bouncer is a total chach, the bartenders are inexperienced, the music is mediocre, and the place is nowhere worth what they charge.",

We had amazing service until Randy the lead waiter took over. He was way off for sure . Foreshadowing, he almost tipped over my wine glass. Thank goodness for Nick , he was amazing and made sure we had water and anything else we needed. Then captain Randy shows up. Don't most steak houses have you cut into your steak before you eat it? Well, that didn't happen here. Fast forward to dessert . When Randy asked what we would like for dessert, my daughter asked for the cookie cake, he left and came back and said well sorry. We ran out of That last night. Weird , don't you make your food fresh each day??? Ten minutes later, he says that he was mistaken , they DO have the cookie cake. Ok , so we get our dessert and have that and then we have been finished for quite sometime before Randy graces us with his presence again. When he does show up and all the dishes have been cleared, he reaches over and spills water all over my husband . No apologies. My daughter and I are handing him napkins and the awesome guy who brought us coffee and water helped get it all cleaned up. He is the one who actually apologized!!! We said. Well you didn't do it. Such a nice guy. Randy came back with our check though and still nothing mentioned about his crappy service. We were done by then. Way too many cool restaurants to go back to this one . Just no!",

  "text": "I was in Philly only for a night, and chose Reading Terminal Market (RTM) to spend my precious hours in philly and it did not disappoint. It is akin to an Anaheim Packing place, Grand Central Market, or any other kind of space with lots of food items inside.\nRTM hits all the points: Philly Cheesesteak (of course!), organic market, deli, bakery, dessert options, and veggie/vegan stands. \n\n1) Spatros Cheesesteak- apparently it is traditional to have yours with cheese whiz, and I got mine with mushrooms and sweet peppers as well. It was very flavorful, and it was a solid cheesesteak. Nothing too spectacular, but i you're looking to check of trying a cheesesteak at its namesake, it'll have you crossing it off your list\n\n2) Beilers Bakery- I had such a hard time choosing what to get from this place, as everything looked sooooooo good. I ended up with the blueberry bread, which was divine. It had fresh blueberries and it took lots of mindpower to stop myself each time I got started\n\nAltogether, this is a bang for your buck while you're in Philly and should come here for some ambience and food if you're in town!",

It was the end of breakfast and they were all getting ready for lunch. The servers were at a table by the kitchen and all on their phones. They were looking at dresses as I past to go to the restroom.  I am a server and we are not even allowed to have our phones on us ( but we do and hide them) let alone on the floor for the customers to see. Ok on to the food. It was mediocre. I ordered the Benedict with biscuits sausage and gravy it said fried eggs instead of poached so I asked mine for scrambled. When it came the scrambled eggs look like it came out of the carton and not fluffy like real eggs and the taste was bland. I had to add hot sauce and pepper for some taste. The potatoes were good with the bbq sauce on it. The sausage was dry and my cousin did like like his always he said his was very dry..Not sure I will ever go back. If I do it would have to be a different location.",

  "text": "First of all, if I had the opportunity, I would rate this place a zero (no stars) but not able so they get 1 star. Honestly, we ate there a week ago and I am still disgusted at the experience. When we were seated, we were told that we could not order wine by the glass. Ok, so we ordered a bottle of wine (party of 4.) We were then presented with a menu featuring 4 courses for $55 per person. My first course was scallops with a cilantro sauce. Please note, the references to portion sizes are NOT embellished but actual. The plate came out with 4 scallops the size of dimes with droplets of green sauce. I could have EASILY piled all four scallops on one fork. My husband ordered the tartare. This came out in the portion of MAYBE a tablespoon and 1/2 over ONE cracker. The next course was a sweat bread ravioli. Yep, you got it. ONE ravioli and barely enough stuffing to even taste it. Third course was lamb. 4 Slices of thinly sliced lamb with absolutely NO flavor over approx. 3 tablespoons of some lentil mush. Not to bore you with what everyone ate, but the final straw was dessert. Chocolate layer cake with espresso mousse. What a joke. I wish I could draw a picture. The cake came out on a 12 x 12 plate and the wedge was the size of a medium size strawberry. The express mousse was no more than a tablespoon. The waitress then proceeds to ask us if we would like more wine and then informs us that we can order the wine we are having by the glass now... Really?? Why now and not at the beginning of the meal? The tables are very close together, and we spent the better part of the evening shouting because the table of six next to us were right on top of us. The lighting is dreary at best. And here is the best part: with tip, our bill was over $400. We ate on our way home. My husband and I are not big eaters and appreciate smaller portions when dining out, however this was an insult--really. What a disappointment.  I will be surprised if this restaurant makes it a year. Certainly the neighborhood where this is situated cannot afford these prices. Shame.",

Bill said he could have someone over in the afternoon, however Lee Gravelle was able to make it at about 10:00 am. He quickly diagnosed the problem and replaced the non-functioning flame sensor. He tested the ignitor which was on its last legs so we had him replace that too as long as he was here. We had an air filter which was very unusual and had tried to have it replaced before, but without success. Lee was able to modify the air return and replace the old filter with a standard size. Everything now works perfectly, and we are very appreciative of the excellent service we received. We highly recommend Lee and Silver State.",

  "text": "We ducked in just for drinks when it wasn't busy. My husband's never been to Philly and I wanted to show him the gamut this city runs in a short time. I knew it'd been an old bank built in 1925. Today, this place may appear unassuming from the outside, but definitely has WOW factor once inside, the kind you just don't see anymore in newer buildings. The ceilings, the columns, the marble counters, the wrap-around staircases, the wrought iron, a beautiful dining mezzanine, the old vault, etc. etc. This place is a CLASSIC.\n\nWe order old-fashioneds everywhere we go. The ingredients the bartender used were simple and humble, but she made hands-down the BEST old-fashioned I'd ever had in Philly. So well-balanced between the whiskey, the bitters,  and the simple syrup. She finished it with a bit of fruit cocktail. Now I always ask if I can add fruit cocktail if I need to doctor up an old-fashioned. They always look at me like I'm nuts, but don't knock it till you've tried it, and guess they haven't been to Del Frisco's in Philly!\n\nThank you so much for the wonderful experience for my husband and me on that cold afternoon, with the mid-afternoon light filtering through those stories-high windows, and our drinks warming our bellies.",

Last weekend, my wife, daughter and I went and got two very large, fresh made Horchatas and a Loco nacho and 1 order of chicken nachos.   The red salsa is VERY tasty and hot.  At $9.00 a plate, it was WAY more than we could eat.  I eat a lot too.  We were, once again, impressed with the price versus amount of food that you get.  I do see some folks on here complaining about the prices and cleanliness.  If you want a spotless place to sit down and dine, try an INDOOR dinning place....don't come to a walk up window and bitch because the tables and chairs aren't clean.  That's just dumb.  Another thing, this isn't some cheap walk up taco window where you get a small portion of meat, onion and cilantro for $1.00.  Their tacos are about 3x the size of a standard street taco and you get a lot of meat with it.  So for those wanking about the prices, do a fair comparison if you are going to whine about that!  To top it off,  my daughter left her purse there with her easter money in it.  I pretty much assumed it was gone.  The next day, I walked by and just asked the owner if someone turned it in...he went to the back and came out with her purse, everything inside.  Honesty earns you a lot pal...we'll see you again this week for another meal since you were so kind.",

The best part is it's BYOB, just know in advance we brought a cooler and you have to get it down two flights of stairs from street level into the alley and that can be a little tricky.

  "text": "I have thick, frizzy, wavy/curly (2B) hair. I usually switch it up between chin-length and a few inches below my shoulders. \n\nEvery time I go for a cut, I always have to ask the stylist to thin it out, because if I don't have layers, my hair is a frizzy pyramid. Unfortunately, every time I've gotten layers, my hair is flippy and shaggy, a complete mess. When I blow it out, I look like I have The Rachel, circa 1994. When I leave it curly, it's even worse.\n\nSo, I went to the Parlour on a friend's recommendation and got an appointment with Crystal. Before she started working on my hair, we talked for quite a while. She said that she and I had the same texture hair and she knew exactly what to do to make it look less shaggy but not poofy.\n\nShe also told me that it either had to be just above or just below the spot where my neck meets my back because it would flip up otherwise. Nobody else has EVER told me that, and my hair has always flipped. She really took my hair texture into consideration when she was cutting it.\n\nFor the first time in my adult life, I don't have old-timey Jennifer Aniston hair. Crystal did such a good job that my shortest layer actually looks LONGER. I don't know how she did it. She must be a wizard. \n\nThe real test was after I got home. I re-wet my hair and styled it myself. Because anyone can look good when leaving a salon. But I was able to style it on my own and it still looked good.\n\nI also got highlights and I almost gave this a 4 star review because the highlights are a leeeeetle more subtle than what I had in mind. But they were expertly done, and I'm honestly so happy about the cut that I'd give 6 stars if I could.",

  "text": "Used the no wait app to get in line and we were able to walk right in for our table without wasting time standing around. Service was great and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. I have never tried oysters and let him recommend one, The Duxberry,  it was absolutely delicious and so fresh tasting. I like that you can order only 1 or as many as you like instead of having to pay for a full serving. I had the Connecticut style lobster roll and my husband ordered the crab roll. Holy cow this is what lobster is SUPPOSED TO taste like. Perfect texture and not overcooked at all, buttery and rich. The crab was excellent as well and the brioche buns they are served on are just heaven. The hush puppies we ordered as an appetizer were crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside and just  slightly sweet. Just as they should be. We can't wait to return multiple times and try the rest of the menu!",

The cocktails were slamming!; with original drinks I have only seen at Booty's. I loved the way the \"Loos\" (rest rooms) were decorated as Booty features 2 different artists works monthly allowing them to showcase their talents by decorating the rest rooms.  My only complaint is I live too far away to enjoy Bootys on a regular basis, you lucky Nola gang!!!. Next trip I will have my Booty on a stool at Booty's Street Food. oh yeah and loved me some Stumptown Coffee!!!!",

  "text": "Rather than cook after a long day, we decided to go to Steak n Shake in Maplewood.  We were seated quickly, no problem there.  We placed our order, again no problem.  I really wasn't all that hungry and just ordered the small fries and a drink, while the person with me ordered a sandwich and fries, plus a drink.  Now here comes the problems.  We weren't offered water, but I thought my drink would be out quickly.  Nope, not even.  So, we waited a half hour, all the time looking back at our food sitting up on the counter.  The cooks were coming out serving people while the waitress was doing whatever it was she was doing.  Finally, we got our food and drinks.  My fries were barely warm, but I douse them with ketchup so figured since the ketchup was good, I wasn't risking waiting another half hour by complaining about the quality of the fries.  (Besides, I know better than complain to the one handling my food)  We weren't offered refills on our drinks, and by then, I just wanted to leave so I didn't ask.  Before we were finished, our waitress came and grabbed up my companion's plates.  We were never given a check, so we just went to the counter and paid our bill.  The family behind us had kids that were asking for something they had ordered and never got.  I guess we weren't the only ones that were less than pleased.",

  "text": "As a resident of Mt. Airy I had such high hopes learning that a jewish style delicatessen would be opening in our neighborhood; sadly I have been disappointed by this new establishment.  Growing up in a Jewish household I have had a lifelong love affair with all things delicatessen from local to NYC joints that serve the glory of corned beef, tongue, turkey and pastrami sandwiches piled high on luxurious rye bread.  This new place is very far from attaining this level of delicious.  \nFirstly, they opened too soon.  No signage, no register (an appliance that can be procured for under $100 at any staples or rest. supply store), no phone number, cash only, unprepared staffing and an unfinished location still not complete from their construction.  \nThe corned beef is decent as far as meat of this style goes but far too lean to remain moist and tender; the pastrami tastes just like the corned beef with no discernable flavor difference that you expect from a peppered and well seasoned pastrami.  The \"rye\" bread they are offering is a sad excuse, something that resembles a square loaf of wheat and tastes nothing like true authentic rye; there is a great artisan bakery in Chestnut Hill that could source great rye if the ownership looked into them.  The portion size for a sandwich that runs around $10 on average is quite minimal and nothing that any true deli connoisseur would come to expect from a deli. Their pickles are satisfactory, at least the dill pickles.  The \"pink\" pickles made with beet juice, not so much. \nThe second point of contention I had was with the health code standards.  The main \"chef\" preparing the meal was in compliance with washed hands and gloves whereas the would be owner decided to assist him in setting up bread for our sandwiches having not washed his hands or put on gloves but after touching his head and face; these are clear health code violations.  Employee open beverages held behind the counter on food prep surfaces as well; all big pitfalls to those unaware of proper health code operating standards.  \nOn paper this place is a great idea but not well executed and pushed to open too early.  It is unacceptable to not have any sort of register to run transactions, phone for ordering or even full scale signage or menu boards and expect to operate soundly and successfully.  \nI would recommend Knishes and Dishes in Lafayette Hill, a mere 10 minutes away and with incredible meats and the Rye bread needed to compliment those offerings.  \nMy advice to the ownership:  take a minute, regroup, do your research, prepare yourselves and your team to be able to run this establishment properly.  \nThis neighborhood is spawning some great establishments as well as being the steward of some years old fantastic spots; Mt. Airy and the residents here deserve only the best, remember that.",

Mike's is a small ice cream parlor, one that barely fits the patrons and its popularity. There is some effort that went into decorating this place like an old school ice cream parlor, with it's small tables and chairs, counter tops, and unique wall décor. \n\nMike serves a wide selection of handmade ice cream in a variety of different ways and they are extremely generous on their scoops. Between the two of us, we shared a single scoop of pralines and cream on a waffle cone and it was almost too much--and we're both like our ice cream! The ice cream is very creamy and incredibly delicious. In this particular flavor, there were generous amounts of praline--a few in every bite, and lots of caramel swirls. Our ice cream was truly divine and it seems like everyone else's ice cream was also delicious as no one could make it to the register without first taking a bite! \n\nAlthough we didn't venture this way, I noticed a few cool things that could spice up your ice cream treat here, such as a cookie cone or a Nutella sundae...but who needs spicing to this already delicious treat? Definitely a must try and completely worth the calories!!!",

They share a parking lot with Barnes & Noble and Great Basin Brewing so I imagine parking can be an issue during busy times.  They have two dining options - the first is with their traditional menu where you sit and a waiter takes care of you, the second is their express dining.  It's sort of a lunch line where they make the food fresh, but it's a limited menu and they do it for both lunch and dinner.  We went with the traditional dining and were seated promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and he kept the drinks and fresh bread coming.  The bread was delicious, piping hot with rosemary and they have olive oil and balsamic for dipping.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli for lunch and it was really good with lots of mushrooms.  However, I think the plate may have been left under the warmer a bit too long.  The plate was scalding hot - no biggie but the parts of ravioli without sauce were very dry and almost crunchy.  That's really the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4.  I was really looking forward to that cheat lunch and it just didn't live up to my expectations.",

  "text": "Ordered some late night grub from here for delivery when in Nashville after a night out. They were great! I ordered a wood oven, 18 inch, gluten free margherita pizza. I was mostly just intrigued because I have never seen a gluten free pizza that size. Shortly after I ordered, I received a call from the restaurant saying there was an issue with the order and they were going to send two smaller gluten free pizzas instead of one larger one. Sooo that's how you do it! ;) Oh well, I think I made out with more pizza anyway!\n\nPizza was a hit. Only downsides were a little too much garlic and it did not reheat well. But it was FABULOUS night of delivery. Very much enjoyed! Plus our delivery driver was also super friendly and perky despite the almost 3 am delivery time.",

  "text": "I have been extremely disappointed in Bar Crawl Unlimited.\n\nMany people were upset that they would not issue refunds to the New Orleans Margarita Bar Crawl at The Old Absinthe House on Bourbon Street in July 2019.  The event was cancelled the day before it was scheduled, with no refunds given.\n\nPeople wanted refunds because Hurricane Barry's landfall was scheduled in New Orleans for the night of the bar crawl that had been canceled.  After many negative Facebook comments, Bar Crawl Unlimited generously offered a refund to everyone for that special case.  HOWEVER, over two weeks later, no one I know has actually gotten a refund even after many emails and calls to Bar Crawl Unlimited.  \n\nThe only way anyone got their money back was to file a fraudulent business claim with their bank.  The Bar Crawl Unlimited Facebook is currently blocking anyone on Facebook that is leaving a comment asking for a refund, or suggesting that the business is weird for deleting comments asking for this refund that has been promised.  Comments asking for refunds, and comments containing negative reviews have all been hidden by the business' social media moderators.\n\nI actually spoke to their PR guy on the phone, who promised to give me free tickets to the New Orleans crawl in November for being patient and honest with him on the phone (he was nice, apologetic, and said he had no control over the Facebook moderators blocking everyone, but that he would work on it). He promised to speak to the social media team to \"unblock\" me on Facebook (for writing a comment asking why no one was receiving refunds). However, neither of these PROMISED things have happened, as well as no refunds, and because I am still blocked on their only social media platform, I have no way to tell others who may be interested in this event that they are being dishonest to both me and my friends.\n\nThey are behaving dishonestly, and unfortunately, I will not be attending any of their events.  I'm even afraid that the bars who host their events will lose business because of Bar Crawl Unlimited's dishonesty.\n\nThank you for your attention,\nTiffany Bell",

You walk in, grab a menu, order and then grab a table. \n\nI ordered a seasonal honey bear latte that I 100% recommend. It wasn't too sweet and the cinnamon was a nice touch. \n\nMeal was the roasted beet salad. I loved that the majority of the salad was actually beets. I'm usually hesitant to have dressings served on the salad instead of on the side but it wasn't overdone and the vinaigrette was not overdone at all. I'm actually regretting not asking for a bottle of it to go! \n\nWe also shared a cup of the carrot cauliflower soup.  It could have been a little warmer but they were very busy so it's fine. Flavors were incredible and it wasn't too thick. \n\nThe bread they served with it had excellent flavor, but it tasted like grease instead of butter.  Which is the only thing I wouldn't recommend. \n\nAll in all - It's worth checking out and the main courses were incredible.",

  "text": "Ahhhh I like crepes but not empty crepes lol.\n\nCame here during my stay back in 2018. I've been to the food court at West Edmonton Mall many times, and never really gave this place a thought in the world until one day when I was craving a snack that would keep me full for a few hours. I noticed this place while the rest of my family members were fixated on Subway and thought, eh, why not?\n\nPros:\n- In the food court near Galaxyland so it's definitely that spot for dessert or even a savory snack.\n- Serves both savory and sweet crepes, with their creations nicely presented as plastic representations at the front for you to see. Each crepe has its own name and pricing available.\n- Accepts cash and card.\n\nCons:\n- Overpriced for dwindling quality.\n- Crepes do NOT look as nice as their plastic menu shows them to be. They're lackluster and skimpy in terms of the filling. \n- Workers do not greet you, and they look like they don't even want to be there.\n\nI ordered #11 I believe which is whipped cream, strawberries. and chocolate drizzle. What I got was loads of crepe that had no filling, and probably a few strawberry slices with heaps of whipped cream and barely any chocolate. Prolly wouldn't come back if ever I'm back in Canada.",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because this was my first experience with the wonderfulness of Guatemalan food!\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI say it every time... I think I was meant to be Spanish. \n\nYelp celebrity Gerardo L took me here today for a little look at what Guatemalan food is all about. After one visit, I am completely sold. Everything I ate was amazing. The tamale was the best I've ever had. The bread was amazing. My meal was a uniquely seasoned pork dish called Cafe Adobada. \n\nIt was 50% familiar, and 50% unique... which I realize sounds weird. So allow me to explain. The taste was similar to other great Latin dishes that I've had, but at the same time, it also had a one-of-a-kind feel to it. It also had this really buttery sour cream that accompanied it... that was almost worth the price of the meal alone!\n\nFor dessert, I had a concoction of warm corn milk. Sounds gross, right? Well, it was not. It was actually pretty great. Definitely not your typical dessert, but I liked it.\n\nThe bottom line - this place absolutely rocks... and you should absolutely check it out soon!",

  "text": "This place is so pretty inside. The entrance has a nice waterfall glass. The other decoration throughout is warm and inviting to have a nice sit down meal with great ambiance and comfortable seating.\n\nThe staff was polite and helpful. The food was so tasty! Loved the flatbread with cilantro and basil raw onion and butter the combination was delicious.\n\nWe ordered dolmades they were not to our complete liking flavor was there but rice was too mushy inside, they cooked them too long or contemplated if they were from a can.\n\nThe salad we ordered was shirazi we were disappointed although it looks good we found the flavor not fresh. With dishes like this it should be cut as close to serving as possible not to sit in a big container so it gets funny tastes. The tomatos were too soft and could of been fresh as well cucumbers were not crunchy fresh. If this would of been cut fresh I know we would of loved it but it was not. \n\nThe main meal was delicious. We ordered Persian room special came with filet mignon, chicken filet, koobideh kabob with rice and grilled vegetables. Superb!! Flavors were jumping out of all the different meat choices and cooked perfectly. Rice was great and the grilled charred tomatos were so yum!\n\nOverall this place is great! When we come back we want to order the Tah Dig hope they have it.",

  "text": "This is the worst experience you'll ever have. In a world where you hear about the restaurant industry suffering and needing your business, no one told Benihana Plymouth Meeting! I was grateful they were serving hibachi at all, and our party was large so we're split to two tables, and they wouldn't allow me to add guests after I made the res due to Covid policy. I get all that. We were not greeted at the door, so already not great, after the frustrating attitude of the sassy woman who takes the reservations, and the inability to increase our party size. No one smiled. They took our cake, and I heard her say it was cut under her breath. Meaning the cake was getting more love than the humans about to pay them. We were finally sat, after I said something to the manager who told me they still had 5 minutes before they had to seat us. Ugh. Then our servers were slow, including ours that didn't turn on the table which caused a delay in our meal. The actual hibachi guys were great for both tables, they made jokes and catered to the younger ones. Very nice. The server ended our meal by bringing the wrong check. So that sums them up. I had a member in my party that reminded me that we had had a similar experience 5 years ago at the same location. I don't know if the entire company sucks, I'd try a different location, but this one should become another failed restaurant. I'll find hibachi elsewhere! Happy birthday to my son.",

  "text": "Cute neighborhood restaurant we stumbled upon while shopping. It is located in the back corner of a plaza with Michael, nutrition smart, and some others.\n\nOne tip here is that it is cash only! But they do have an ATM in the store. One thing this place makes me feel is like I am in a small town. Despite it being located in a busy area the atmosphere feels homey. \n\nThe menu is a decent size and they offer breakfast and lunch. Looking over the menu, it looks like they have a Greek influence. There are many greek items mixed in the different categories and a while greek section. \n\nThey had many specials available, including the pumpkin pancakes. We were pretty hungry after running errands all day, so I wanted an omelette and pancakes. Luckily, they have that as an option with their omelettes. I got the Greek\nOmelette with a pumpkin pancake as my starch. I also got egg whites instead of the whole egg.\n\nWhat I liked here, was that you get a lot of food for your money, that also tastes good. My food was as described and good. I think we found a new neighborhood breakfast spot to come to!",

  "text": "My husband was passing by Willie's while searching for a po boy for dinner, while he wasn't able to find a po boy at night. We decided to check out Willie's since they have several locations in the area, and they pride themselves for being famous for fried chicken in New Orleans. We had to see what the hype was all about. The skin was really crispy, the meat is tender, however my only critique is the amount of oil that soaked through the bed of fries, which made my fries soggy and into the piece of parchment paper. We are staying literally right up the street, it's a 2 minute walk here, and it was already like that by the time he brought it back. I'd say you'd have to dine in here if you don't want soggy fries. The biscuit is is made perfectly, buttery and flaky -- however, I didn't like how sweet the bread was. I guess it really comes down to your palette preferences, but the chicken is really good hands down. The fries and biscuit is something that I can personally take it or leave it. They also sell their food in combo meals, so you can't buy the chicken by itself or a la carte. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for some delicious fried chicken, and I plan on coming back before I leave this weekend to try their COCKtails (no pun intended).",

  "text": "Ok fine,,, I'll give it to you. I always thought that this chain was a bit too tourist trap-ish... BUT I can't just let my bias get the better of me. So we're here and we're going to smash.\n\nLet's begin shall we.\n\nWaffles:     I really enjoyed the texture, soft and crispy that's not painful to consume. The syrup was perfect accompaniment to the whole dish.\n\nMac & Cheese:     This side is fire yo, I adore the depth and meaty flavors. This dish definitely came to slay.\n\nGreens:     I can't believe I'm eating greens from a chain and it's actually phenomenal. We definitely enjoyed every bit of this dish.\n\nChicken Quarter (HOT):     WEAK, I was expecting my mouth to be on fire but it didn't. I feel as if an amateur spicy food eater can handle this level of heat. Plus the flavor was a bit lacking.\n\n3 stars, just because the opening acts should never EVER out do the main event. This spot definitely scored high marks on the side show category. High enough to forgive that excruciating wait to be seated. Anyways, it's whatever. I gave my score because I was not impressed by whatever food you're known for. People will still flock to you. Your marketing is definitely on point.\n\nThank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!",

The name really overstates and hypes the experience somewhat in my opinion but I applaud the creativity. I understand volume is the attraction for many but when the business model includes consignment items the quality can somewhat get diluted and I feel that's the case here. I'm not saying there aren't any treasures here it's just going to take a little more time to find them if they does exist. There was no interaction with the staff which is actually a positive for me I just want to explore on my own at my my own pace. I'm sure if I needed assistance it was readily available I could hear their conversation ring throughout the shop and they seemed friendly during the greeting upon my arrival. The bathroom was very clean...",

It got to me a lot faster the second time, it was the right food, it was hot, and the driver was very polite, and very apologetic. I am a huge fan of their food even the pizza.

  "text": "I have been twice, both within a week of each other, and the food is great! I would give 5/5 for food and 5/5 for ambiance. The only reason I took off one star is for service, as it seems it can be a bit of a hit or miss. The first time I came, the waiter forgot quite a few things and charged me for a spicy mayo he never brought. The 2nd time the waiter just seemed like he was new, but he was great aside from not being too familiar with the menu. .\nThey also have happy hour specials, with discounted sushi rolls and cocktails. I recommend the Lobster Fresh roll and the 1st Avenue roll, and the Bourbon on the Ave drink. All very tasty! The Lobster Fresh really lives up to its name, as it just tastes super fresh and crisp.\nAll in all, I am a fan of this place and will definitely be returning. It's a bit of a drive for us considering we have a usual sushi place we go to near where we live, but it is worth it for evenings where you want to go downtown.",

While on a coastal cruise from LA, our family of 10 spent the morning driving around with Sandy for our \"nostalgia tour.\"  He was very accomodating, as we didn't want the usual tourist tour; we wanted to go by my grandmother's house and places that were most important to us, like where my parents met and where they were married.
