  "text": "I really want to like bryn and dane's because their concept is so great, but every time I go to any location I am disappointed. I agree wholeheartedly with some of the prior reviews expressing that this place delivers anything but FAST food. I went to the Bryn Mawr location for breakfast on a Sunday morning. The place was deserted and yet they still took about 20 minutes to make two egg wraps, one smoothie, and sweet potato hash. Totally unacceptable! No sense of urgency and overall, the staff seemed like they had no idea what they were doing. No greeting when I arrived and no apology when they took forever to make my order, looking like bewildered, incompetent idiots the whole time. Very frustrating and irritating experience, and I won't be back to the Bryn Mawr location ever again. They really need to work on training their employees and making sure they know how to make what is on the menu quickly. I don't think that's too much to ask.",

Very consistent to the Spring House and Philadelphia location. \n\nThe rolls are 8 pieces- I got spicy tuna, tuna avocado, and shrimp tempura (3 roll special: $11.50) and my only issue was the shrimp tempura roll was very small. No veggies and the shrimp was small. \n\nAnother observation, most sushi places I've been to give a ridiculous serving of wasabi but I didn't get half way through my rolls before running out of wasabi! Never thought that would be an issue but the portion was very small. Other than that they have a variety of rolls and options. So good!",

  "text": "I just got home from a big family brunch at the Cheesecake Factory. It was probably my last visit. There was a ridiculously long wait for the food. I did enjoy my pancakes, which were served with only a tiny cup of syrup. My tomato juice was sour. Others needed more coffee, and were complaining about not having enough syrup. There was a long wait for the server to come back, then another long wait for coffee, syrup, and to have my sour tomato juice replaced with supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice. I stopped eating for quite some time, because I had nothing to wash down dry pancakes. The orange juice at least wasn't spoiled, but I have a hard time believing it's fresh squeezed, when my supermarket brand orange juice that comes in half gallon cartons tastes much better. I understand that people are busy, but the service was so horrible that meal should have been comped. No one even apologized for the endless waits for anything, or offered any reasons.",

When we were purchasing this home I knew it was going to be on me to make sure I went through the right company as this lot was missing fence in a big area.

  "text": "After hearing about the Franklin Fountain online, the fat kid in me was extremely excited to try a scoop of one of their \"amazing\" ice creams. So much for having a \"long list\" of ice creams! It was a short list of flavors you'd pretty much find anywhere else. I ordered a scoop of their pistachio ice cream and it was fairly standard. Perhaps it's the jaded New Yorker in me- being spoiled by the likes of Van Leeuwen, Big Gay Ice Cream, Morgenstern's, etc. but it was extremely underwhelming. \nIt did begin to pour while we were on line and I managed to get the only table available indoors. Unfortunately, the quaint and retro ambiance of the Franklin Fountain was pretty much ruined by their employees. Apparently they were conducting interviews for new employees and had set up a table right next to mine. After about 15 minutes of listening to their inane conversations (making fun the applicants, etc.), my boyfriend and I couldn't take it anymore and walked out into the rainstorm just to get away from them. I may decide to visit Philly again... But I'm definitely not coming back here.",

If you can look past the sales experience which tends to be a bit too pushy, the rest of the work is top notch. \n\nThe Quality of the windows are outstanding. The first experience was to replace a very large sliding glass door and it has to be the best I've ever had. The seals are strong, the window has held up so well in the last 5 years. The project manager was great and the crew was fast and efficient. Since then I called them to replace bedrooms windows and today bathroom windows.

  "text": "I've tried this location and the one in Whole Foods. This last time (from the Whole Foods) is why I've finally decided to complain. \n\nI thought it was a fluke with our first order, but both times now the food was extra special salty!!!!! From the Whole Foods location we ordered the whole (small) chicken with salad (maybe 2 cups), hummus (2 cups), and pita (6 of them). The chicken was extremely salty and the sad excuse of a salad was even worse. \n\nNot only was the salad salty, but it was also ridiculously small. It comes in the same size container as their hummus and it's pineapple, cucumber, spices, and some other various things. I'm not sure how that is supposed to feed an entire family???  There's barely 2 cups worth of salad in the container. What!?!?! That's not a salad for a family, that's barely a snack for an individual!\n\nThe only good things about this meal - the hummus was ok...salty again, but more edible than the salad or chicken. You get 6 pitas...although, they aren't outstanding pitas and not really worth eating.  \n\nFor $36 plus tax, this wasn't worth the price. Throw on top of it that it was barely edible because of the salt content, and I'd say it was pretty much worthless! Dizengoff, you should cut back on your salt for all of your dishes. Then maybe we could actually taste your food. \n\nWe are extremely disappointed and will never eat there again.",

Wait staff are pleasant but not adequately trained. The Treno cheese board has devolved from interesting choices of cheeses  and charcuterie to something that looks like leftover bits from last night's party. The sauces are all the same whether its bolognese, mussels or pizza. It was hard to find any short rib in the Short Rib Bolognese.  On the upside, pizzas are still pretty good.

Normally if we go on a Friday or Saturday night there is a wait. However the wait never seems as long as they said.  When we do have a wait we hang out in the bar section, We have always had friendly people wait on us.  The food comes out quick. The food is your typical pub, sports bar food. My husband and I enjoy having this restaurant in walking distance to our home. I know we will be back!",

  "text": "Tampa, FL: Last night I enjoyed a good meal at Ulele. Was it the best meal I've ever had? No. Did I enjoy the meal? Yes. Will I recommend the place? Probably.\n\nWe called to make a reservation for two yesterday. We were told we didn't need reservations but if we wanted to make a reservation, the only openings were at 7:00 pm and 8:45 pm. We took the 8:45 pm. We ended up finishing our tasks early and got to the restaurant at 7:45 pm. We were chastised - not joking - by the guy at the front, who told us we had arrived too early. We told him we understood and after calming down, the employee told us we could sit at the bar and sit get served food.\n\nAfter a rude introduction, I enjoyed sitting at the bar. Our bartender/server, unlike the man at the front, was very sweet and extremely attentive - my water glass was never empty the entire meal. Though I didn't drink last night, I also enjoyed the look and energy of the bar, including the unique cocktails the bartenders concocted.\n\nI ordered the Florida Pompano, complete with a creamy tomato sauce, fried carrot ribbons, mashed potatoes, and green beans. As an occasional pescatarian, eating meat is quite heavy on my stomach. That didn't stop me from scarfing down half of the pompano filet last night - the sauce was INCREDIBLE and everything, even the carrot ribbons, worked well together. Though I'd prefer a better presentation - having the carrots piled on one side of the plate wasn't particularly appealing visually - I didn't have any complaints about the taste and creativity of the entree.\n\nI ended the meal with a slice of guava pie. The presentation was lovely, and the taste decent. I didn't mind the dessert ultimately, but I'm not going to be clambering to find another slice.\n\nUltimately, I liked this place. While I didn't care for the look of the place - it was a bit busy - the location off the park was unique and lovely. I didn't appreciate the employee at the front, and I think the price was a bit high for what I got. The creativity was refreshing though and I wouldn't hesitate to send people to Ulele. It's a \"must try\" restaurant at least once.",

  "text": "Nothing like having your dishwasher stop draining with a houseful of family visiting for the holidays! After discovering my regular appliance repair folk had retired off to Oregon, I frantically started calling friends and using YELP for appliance referrals in my area (North Shore: Incline Village, Lake Tahoe). When the phone rang and I heard Victor's calm, reassuring voice on the other end, I felt like it was a holiday miracle, and it was. He was on his way to Tahoe City and said he could swing by our house first. He even let my husband know what to check for (hose wise) for a blockage that might be the culprit. When he finally arrived the job was completed with 45 minutes and the culprit was a shard of piece of glass stuck in the pump. Everyone I had called couldn't come for a week, and they wanted well over $100 just for the service call and evaluation. Victor charged $75 for the service call and it went towards all his labor. Final bill: $135. Victor, what can we say . . .  you were definitely our holiday hero! If you are ever in need do not hesitate to call on Victor. Young, handsome, polite & professional! \n~ Carole & Terry Bernardi; Incline Village",

  "text": "We came here on a recent visit to Nola, we came upon it wandering around after riding the streetcar. And what a gem we found! This is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at in Nola. I did not realize at the time but it's listed as one of the top 50 restaurants in America. I can see why. The outside of the restaurant is what caught our attention. Tables outside, beautiful top balcony with very nice plants. We were seated at a cozy table inside and were immediately greeted by our phenomenal server Rene. Impeccable service from start to finish. He helped us pick out a great bottle of wine from their very extensive wine menu, which was at least 7 pages! We were overwhelmed by all the choices. We enjoyed a bottle of Bordeaux called    Diem. They have wines from all over the world here. I never seen a wine list quite like this one. The menu is just as amazing. Unique selections. For starters we shared a seasonal green salad that had feta, cucumbers, croutons and the most delicious buttermilk scallion dressing. Excellent! We loved the flavor combinations. We also shared a small plate of the beef short rib. Fall off the bone tender, with a wonderful salsa verde and horseradish cream sauce. For the main entrees we ordered the crispy goat which came with curried cauliflower, black beans and yogurt. It was presented in a large bowl. It was delicious! Similar to a curry but had large tender pieces of goat. Wonderful flavors and the perfect blend of spices. Incredible choice. My entree was a grilled Zabuton steak with French fries. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare. Beautifully marbled cut of meat. Tender and perfect. The fries were served with a nice sauce as well. We loved this place so much. We passed on dessert because we were so full. The ambiance, food, and service were simply phenomenal. The prices are very fair and not overpriced. Highly recommend eating here.",

They do take reservations if you are on a time crunch, otherwise they do a good job of getting people in and out but there may be a small wait.\n\nFood options are a variety of salads, sandwiches, and even some wood oven pizzas.  Bread for the table is available but on request.  The salad I had was plentiful for a lunch portion and was very fresh.  If you're in the mood for something non-chain when at the mall, this would definitely be a good option.",

There was a decent overflow of people waiting and I anticipated a much longer wait time than what we experienced which was about 20 minutes. This gave us time to engage in some observation of the clientele as well as the delicious breakfast items being pushed out by the kitchen. \n\nI loved the decor, clean, modern and welcoming! \nThe breakfast menu can satisfy from savory to sweet. My friend and I shared a cinnamon roll before our main dish arrived. She had the eggs Benedict and I had a wonderful has. The food was seasoned really well, came out hot, and was ample in size for our post yoga consumption, I had to take some of my hash home. \n\nOverall I am for sure a fan of this place and look forward to dining on the patio when the weather is a bit warmer! \n\nMy only criticism is for a refill of coffee they charge you .75 cents.  I don't know enough about the quality of coffee they serve but I can't imagine it's so extraordinary that you'll need to charge customers extra for a refill. Was just a tad put off by this!",

(thank god) i tend to look like i'm crying when the spice level is off the radar so i didn't want to make a scene at one of my regular lunch spots lol\n\nbut yes i do recommend trying this! the beef was yummy with the slow cooked radish.  there was plenty of noodles in my bowl.  it took quite the effort for me to finish my lunch today. i was holding my belly walking out nan zhou...  so all in all, lunch-- well served! can't wait to return for another round!",

As you're eating the stage in front of you backs up to full glass windows from the length of the floor to the ceiling and what is on the other side of the windows in clear view, the beautiful lit up batman building (ATT building).  It's gorgeous. Great cameo pics.  So let's discuss the food, it seemed to be all high ticket items, like steak and the normal nice steak house sides, potatoes, etc. Nothing tasted that great. It was really bland and it wasn't necessarily HOT coming to us straight out of the oven. I wasn't impressed.  The drinks, I stuck with wine and I feel like they tasted skimpy on the pour for the price and a touch watered-down. I know, how is that even possible?

Upon walking in the attendant, Theresa, welcomed me and made me feel right at home. Customer service with a genuine smile and gratitude for her customers is what I appreciated right away.\nThe laundry itself is large, very clean, newer (some brand new) washers and dryers, a sweet little seating area where you can read a magazine, watch TV, or surf the web with their free WiFi. The prices are fair, not too expensive, and when I tell you that those dryers are brilliant I mean BRILLIANT! My clothes are dry in 27 minutes or less!\nSince I began using Campbell Coin I've moved into midtown Tucson, and even though there are closer laundromats to my house for me to use, I keep coming back here because I honestly believe this establishment to be the best in Tucson!",

But I will have to say I was looking at the kitchen the entire night which for me is how you can see if a restaurant is going to be good.

I appreciate a falafel place with few choices, and the sandwiches come fully loaded unless you say otherwise -- when I don't feel like doing my own toppings combo, this is perfect.\n\nAs you probably figured out, Goldie is from the same people as Zahav, with great falafel/everything as a result. When you're ordering, there are only a few choices (plus a couple on an \"off-menu\" board, for a change of pace) -- for falafel sandwich, you choose the flavor of falafel (plain, harissa, amba, or shug, I tend to get harissa because I forget what the others are). Fries are a cool $3 but super tasty ... you can probably share an order (small bag) with someone if you're like me, but I can also clear a bag myself pretty easily.\n\nTahini shakes are so great but I have to have room for it -- so rich! In general though, I love that they're on the limited menu, and I love that coming to Goldie is uncomplicated. There're places to sit down and eat in (with a pretty nice atmosphere for a sandwich shop), and in the warmer season, it's great to pick up and walk to Rittenhouse with your food.

I ordered the #7 regular which is turkey and provolone.  Mike's Way with mayo and extra oil and vinegar !  Customer service is great and you are greeted with a smile.   For those of you that don't know, there is a Jersey Mike's on south meadows and also in sparks.  Haven't tried those locations yet, but I think it's great we have 3 locations here in Reno/Sparks now!",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I moved to Indy about 6 months ago. It was time for him to get a check up and so he picked somewhere that accepts his insurance, had decent reviews on google and was close to work. He returned very happy with his care and a new patient goody bag! I unfortunately broke my permanent retainer from braces. I searched around close to home, but at the end of the day nothing beats a great review from another patient! The 25 minutes drive was way worth it. They were able to get me in quickly. I knew I was in the right place when the new patient paperwork asked about barriers to care such as time, money, etc. It was a sign that Kingseed Family Dental viewed us as humans with lives and priorities instead of numbers. I had Dr. Ebisinde Akah as my dentist. She gave me more than one option to solve the broken retainer dilemma and even asked if I had enough time that day or needed a second appointment (as a grad student, I wrote time and money as my barriers). Lindsey Davis, EFDA was also a part of my care team. Both women were incredibly friendly and considerate! When I came back to get my new night retainer fitted it was great but not perfect. They sent me home with the great one while making me a perfect one at no charge!  I'm excited to make Kingseed Family Dental my dentist for as long as I'm in Indianapolis Area!\n\nP.S. there are lots of tvs, even one to keep you occupied when laying all the way back in the dental chair. Big perk!",

They don't have massage chairs, you sit perched on a bench for the pedi's and at a somewhat regular desk for mani's.  Given how expensive their services are, all of the add-on prices seem even more outrageous.  The standard nail polish isn't great.  For some reason it seems like it doesn't dry all of the way, even if you sit patiently for over 30 minutes.  The free mini polish with some of the pedi's is a nice touch and frankly almost necessary given how odd the polish is.  The tecs are very nice but the prices are out of touch for this area.",

  "text": "This is one of the worst stores that I have ever purchased from.  I purchased a large order from them and after I came back to my office I realized that I had to exchange one of the desks for a smaller one to fit into the office.  I called the store in Conshohocken where I just made the purchase and found out that there is no way to get through to the store.  Since I did not know the extension number for the sales person I dealt with it said that I can dial by name by putting the first three letter of the first name.  I did and the message I got is that there is no such person in this store.   Calling their customer service call center I was on hold for 45 minutes before a person picked up the phone and advised me that he could not help me as he only deals with purchases online.  I asked him if he could transfer me to the store and his comment was that they really don't like that and that I should just go back to the store to make the exchange.  He said that he will transfer me, he pushed some button did not have the courtesy to wait to see if the transfer sent through and an error message came up that the transfer could not go through.  I now have to go back to the store which is a gross inconvenient since I am far away from that store.  This was my first and now the last purchase I will ever make from this store.  They have no services after the sale.  Amazon is where I will continue to go to as they don't have any of this nonsense.",

  "text": "WB Pizza \n\nA friend told me the WB Pizza offered a ton of vegan options! \n\nLocated close to the broad ripple area, I finically had a chance to try their pizza. \n\nFrom the outside you may be a little skeptical in which it is located in a small strip mall near a liquor store and not much else. \n\nWB pizza is a local business and has been around for a good amount of time, since 1999. It's always great to support locally run businesses. It is a small restaurant, but has plenty of tables to accommodate big groups if needed. \n\nTheir menu has so many options, including vegan cheese and newly added vegan \"meats\". They also have a large selection of beer for all of the beer lovers out there. \n\nWe ordered the breadsticks with some of their garlic butter which is vegan and cheese (non vegan) for the others at the table. \n\nThe breadsticks were to die for. Honestly they were my favorite, even compared to the pizza. They were warm, small in size, with a slight crisp, and baked just right. \n(See pictured below).\n\nThe pizza we had was \"the vegan\" with no cheese. However they do offer vegan cheese for an upcharge. We also ordered another speciality pizza that had meat and cheese, which I can't speak of since I don't eat those things. \n\nI was impressed with the pizza and the amount of veggies on top but I wish the actual base of the pizza would have been cooked more because it was a very flimsy pizza. I would have preferred a little more spice of some sort. I liked the taste, but was disappointed when the check came out...\n\nTwo pizzas (12'') and breadsticks, a piece of vegan chocolate cake for almost 80 dollars, not including a tip. Now that is ridiculous!! \n\nI do have to admit that the vegan chocolate cake really made up for the cost because the cake was AMAZING! I mean it too! It was moist, light, and the frosting was delicious. This came close to being my favorite over the breadsticks. \n\nThe trick is to make your own pizza and add few toppings that you want because the speciality pizzas DON'T state their price on the menu and have a lot of toppings on them which are totaled to the same price as a custom pizza. I get that the ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade, but pizza ingredients aren't that expensive and I know this because I have made my own many times at home. \n\nIf you want to support a local business and want fresh cooked pizza at a high price, visit WB Pizza. \n\nI am unsure if I will return due to the shock I was in with the cost of the pizza mainly due to the fact that the menu is very misleading. I would definitely return for vegan desserts and breadsticks though!!!",

  "text": "Shockingly delicious. Vegan only. Pricing is a bit on the higher end especially since there is 0 protein BUT portions are generous and the quality is superb. We went for brunch. The cubano was awesome and flavorful with a healthy portion of breakfast potatoes. It always stuns me how well their chicken substitute is. It looks and tastes like chicken... go figure. I had the huevos rancheros which were two large portions with guac -- major key. We also did coffee and one of their salads. Food was super dope. Similar to a true European restaurant you pay for still and sparkling water unless you say you want tap. Ambiance is great too. Small, nice bar area, takeout window is cute, music is nice. Might be a good date spot. Would definitely go again.",

  "text": "The restaurant owner is arguably the most inconsiderate person I have interacted with at Reading Terminal since moving here 2.5 years ago and going dozens of times to the market. For starters, he charges way too much for his food ($16.71 for the plate in the picture) but that isn't what led me here. He lacks decency. He gave me a salad container that was practically quarter filled only (how it looks in the picture is how I got it), and didn't even explain if he ran out or what the reason was. He just covered the container and handed it to me. I then sat at the place's counter top that has a few high chairs to sit at. He decided he wants to clean the area so he does so while I'm eating and pretty much works around me while giving me \"are you done with your food\" looks. Instead of taking my plate and throwing it away in the trash right behind the counter he points me to a trash in the corner away from the restaurant to throw my plate away in. I would give 0 stars if I could. \n\nHe just lost a customer :)",

The equipment was in rougher shape compared to other boxes but the humidity and weather take a toll on metal equipment. \nOverall, this box has an awesome community feel with a wide variety of class offerings throughout the day.

Matt was kind, professional, and didn't unnecessarily recommend things just to make more money (he even left me with some tools to help identify/fix the issue I was having with my sink drain in case it happened again).

Was immediately welcomed into the friendly tea house with grandma chic decor and whimsically mismatched furniture. The waitress invited us behind the counter to smell and the teas, it took awhile as there are so many options! We added the savory option to our tea choosing from a quiche or bread pudding. I chose the bread pudding with herbs, mushroom and kale. It was wonderfully reminiscent of stuffing. Im taking one star off here are we waited about 30minutes until this dish arrived. Otherwise the tea service was fantastic. The scones were delicious, i couldn't  get enough of the clotted cream and jam. Everything is made from a scratch, including the bread for the cucumber sandwiches. Cally herself came by to recommend eating the meringue with clotted cream, it was delicious! Although I think that cream could make everything delicious. The high tea was $40, which is cheaper than other high tea options in town. I would return for the lovely atmosphere and delicious scones",

Something was off with the third. As long as the baristas focus on TASTING the espresso shots they are serving and develop their own pallet for what is good vs what is mediocre this place will be a solid 5. When attention to shot weight, distribution of fines, tamping consistency, and shot extraction gets bypassed, they will drop down to a 4/5; just another hipster coffee joint serving mediocre lattes with Rosetta's on top... until then, I can say with confidence that this is THE place for espresso based drinks. Keep up the good work. Also if you are looking to slouch in a couch or comfy chair this might not be the place. Seating angles of the chairs are perfect 90 degrees !!",

  "text": "Went here for the first time since the remodel, which is actually still partially in progress. \n\nSome of the screens now have assigned seating with reclining leather seats. Our Sunday evening tickets were 11.99 each. No more cheap seats for the the big box office hits. :( \n\nTheater smells better (used to be a bit musty) and the sound was incredible. Enjoyed the nice seats, but they don't recline as much as Roadhouse and they don't bring you food. So I think I'd rather go to Roadhouse for a few bucks more. \n\nHowever, I might invest in a movie pass subscription which would take away my issue with the higher prices. Check it out if you're a big movie goer $9.99/month for unlimited movies/month (one movie per day) and this theater accepts it!",

So we took one to my mom's house since two people and two pizzas is way too much food!\n\nBesides the fact they have kids running the cash register and phones, we've always had a great experience with them.",

  "text": "If I were rating based on service, this would probably be a 4 or 5, but overall I don't think this is a must do in New Orleans. It's definitely an institution if you want to check it off your list, but for price and time, I'd probably prefer to check out other spots instead. We got the trio of soups to start (sampler of turtle, gumbo and soup du hour which was some vegetable soup for us). I think they were ok- but nothing memorable and honestly on the salty side. We both got fish dishes for our entree. I think my boyfriend's cast iron seared gulf fish was actually quite good- probably the best dish of the night. The pecan crusted fish was good, and supposedly one of their more popular, but I don't know if I'd order again. The desserts were actually pretty decent! My friend is obsessed with their creole bread pudding soufflé and may have raised our expectations too high...it was delicious and quite good! But not like mind blowing as he noted...but definitely worth a try if you're visiting the restaurant. The strawberry shortcake was actually my favorite between the two (we got both). I'll also say the cocktails were pretty decent and not too sweet. I got the sweet potato drink, which didn't taste much like sweet potato but reminded me a bit of a White Russian. Overall lovely staff and restaurant but not in my list of must-dos.",

She immediately recognized that this was my first time coming to the restaurant, and she explained the menu very thoroughly. It's a small selection, but it has, in my opinion, everything you could want for lunch. I ordered BBQ meatballs with macaroni and cheese and collard greens. My boyfriend ordered jerk chik'n with rice and collard greens. We also got two empanadas, one southwest and one pizza. The food was OUTSTANDING and very reasonably priced. Both of the owners are such kind-hearted people, and they each asked us several if we needed anything. We were offered many different sauces to try for no additional charge, and we got to try a mango smoothie that had just been made. At one point, they even took a picture of us to post on their Instagram story! We left with a couple more empanadas (pizza, because it's seriously delicious). The whole experience was definitely worth repeating, and I am already excited to go back!",

I go today at 4:58 am, they open at 5:00 am. I expect to wait at the door for 2 minutes as SB usually opens the doors within seconds of the opening time. A woman comes to the door and tells me that they open at 5:00 but they don't have any coffee brewed, so it will be about 5 more minutes. She had no intention of letting me in. I commented that perhaps they should have started the coffee 3 minutes earlier, a time that will allow them to sell at the opening time. I leave and go to a SB 5 minutes away. The SB that I went to had the Pike Place ready, at 5:04 am!!! This SB is 1 block from my hotel. I will not be back. It's a new SB, so I suggest that someone in management tell them what \"open at 5:00\" truly means. It doesn't mean that the lights are on and the door is open, it means open and ready to do business. Obviously I'm cranky if I don't get my coffee first thing in the morning. BTW, I have never left a negative review for SB, as I love SB coffee.",

Our wait staff, led by Steve were prompt and very informative of the menu. Since it was a special occasion we treated ourselves to the special seafood tower as an appetizer - deliciously fantastic; it included jumbo shrimp (and they were jumbo on steroids); Lobster and crab legs. Our party ordered various entrees from filet, ribeye and N.Y. strip. Sizzling hot, cooked to perfection and a serving size that required us to take home the leftovers. We also enjoyed the lobster bisque soup which was excellent. The lobster Mac and cheese for a side was an unusual combination that we had never enjoyed before- it was a real treat as well- very tasty. Always a evening to look forward to at Ruth Chris!",

The pizzas arrived late (just shy of an hour), lukewarm, soggy and pitiful. The veggie pizza had a generous portion of veggies, but the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas had so little meat on them, they were difficult to distinguish from the cheese pizza. Seriously. I had two pieces of the sausage and there were a total of 5 pieces of sausage between the two pieces, each about the size of a lima bean. In addition, the pizzas almost entirely lacked spice. All you could taste was provel cheese. That is absolutely the last time.",

While it does have despite on the menu it is actually vegetable-driven that is sustainable and local sourced. They have all proteins on the menu with veggies.

No one has ever called to confirm anything from the order to the delivery to the return. I had to go out of my way to call every single time, despite being told that one of their associates would be contacting me. In addition, I caught one of their sales associate lying to me multiple times and had to get the manager involved. The manager was nice and gave me a credit on my account since I had financed through them. Their furniture is nice but their awful customer service means I'm never shopping here again.\nWe ended up returning the couches. We loved them, but unfortunately another couch we were planning on moving to a different room didn't work and we had to send them back. Trying to return them took about a week and a half (despite calling the day after only one couch was delivered) to return them. Once again, I was told that someone would call me to schedule a time to return the couch and no one ever called me. I called in the middle of the week and the next available time was the following weekend.\nI got my bill this month and I saw that they charged me for the protection plan for the couches (despite me returning the couches before I was even charged). I also never received the credit that the manager had promised. When I called billing to clarify this, they were agreeable to credit my account for the protection plan, but the manager who previously helped me refused to give me the $125 credit because I returned the couches (despite him never saying this was the stipulation).\nI called a week and a half ago to sort out this refund issue. Despite being promised it would go through, no refund has been issued. I called the store to discuss this with them and spoke with a different associate who was not even aware of this refund that was supposed to go through.",

  "text": "One of the worst dining experiences i have ever had, ran restaurants for a long time and the wait times and service was out of the world, ordered simple dishes (bowl and chicken fingers) and after waiting for our food forever we were told it is a standard 45 minute wait for those kind of dishes. At any restaurant no food should take longer then 20 minutes tops. The manager Annette Borbon was not much better then our tweaked out service who kept grinding their teeth, all she said was that there was nothing she could do, it is company policy that food takes at least 45 minutes. Exact words. She didn't even listen when i tried explaining what was going on and kept insisting she is not in a position of power to do anything. Once galaxy theaters is built in town i plan on never returning to this business again.",

  "text": "Matteo's, an established Italian restaurant in Noblesville, has expanded to the Northwest side of Indianapolis. New to the location once held by Franco's brother, Arturo, visitors will be happy to know that the family recipes have returned to this charming little spot.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Adam, the Marketing and Sales manager, at an event where he was announcing the opening. He'd brought a creamy tortellini dish that was as absolutely wonderful! We exchanged info, and he reached out to share more information about catering. \n\nBefore long, I'd made plans to visit the restaurant and experience it for myself. Located on the southeast corner of 86th and Ditch, you need to pass the Starbucks to find it. If you're familiar with the old Cinema Grill, its right next to it. \n\nExquisite stained glass doors make for a stunning entrance, nicely framed by a pair of topiary trees. I was immediately greeted by the hostess and hung my coat before being seated. \n\nThe craftsmanship of the woodwork throughout the bar and restaurant area exudes pride and prestige, in line with the ambiance of the rest of the surroundings. This is a perfect location for a dinner date or special occasion. A floor to ceiling cellar is displayed, further complimenting the atmosphere. \n\nAs I was seated, freshly baked bread was served with a savory olive oil.  asked for a wine recommendation and thoroughly enjoyed Matteo's Private Label Cabernet Sauvignon with my dinner, Lamb chop Marsala. The sauce was luxuriously rich, slightly sweet and packed with flavor. My chops were tender, but required a serrated knife that I requested. \n\nService was impeccable throughout, and Franco, the owner, came out to greet guests personally in the dining room. I couldn't leave without the temptation of the dessert menu, and chose Franco's mother's own Crème di Fragole pie, a blissful combination of gelatin and fresh strawberries and cream. \n \nBefore departing I was able to see the Private Dining room, available to seat up to 60 guests. It was a tasteful layout and had potential for a nice reception or alternate meeting location. \n\nI'm thrilled to see Matteo's expansion and look forward to returning with colleagues and family!",

  "text": "Update: review is from before when it was Bay Harbor Hotel under construction. The place was basically a mess with a lot of riff raff.\nPros: gorgeous views of the water and sunset.  Tables and chairs outside behind the building. Restaurant has decent food and drinks. Staff is nice. Recieved 2 $10 vouchers for cafe in lobby.  Cons: hotel needs updating. Pool was not heated and birds were bathing in it. Needed maintenance. Too bad because the pool area could be a chill spot to relax and have drinks or get some sun and read, go for a swim but it's only used as a short cut from behind the building to bar/restaurant. Also, the beach bar was under construction. Last time we were here there were fire pits and volleyball and 2 bars. False advertising as far as the beach bar being open and \"heated\" pool being ice cold. Also, hallways in hotel were not air conditioned.\n When I asked a housekeeping maid if I could switch out a few dirty towels for clean ones, she basically told me no. Then changed her answer when she saw the look on my face. I have worked for 3 different hotel chains with impeccable hospitality. They need to work on theirs here. Rooms and hallways smelled stale and AC unit vents were not adjustable, so they blasted air toward the pillows on the bed, drying out our noses and throat.",

I tried out the wings and hot chicken and waffles. Wings had a good crisp, but past this crispiness was unflavored chicken meat. The hot chicken n waffles were good, but nothing too memorable. Nashville is only about a twenty minute drive from Rivergate, take rush hour out of the picture, and I would definitely make the drive downtown just to get good hot chicken. As other reviewers stated, definitely call in beforehand and you will get your food in a timely manner. Helen's is convenient for those living in the area who crave some chicken, yet again, I would take the extra drive to Nashville for amazing hot chicken and sides.",

They have a beautiful deck to enjoy in the summer and fall. During the winter months there's a fireplace inside to make it cozy! The food is good, but expect higher prices than in the valley. There's a cost to do business on the mountain, increased delivery charges and labor. Most employees have to commute, so please keep this in mind while tipping. The weekends are crazy but if you can get away during the week it's a delight. I really enjoy the Friday Fish Fry! Service is sporadic depending upon the staff.

I had them hold the sauces as I don't like mayo on my sushi. Well, I think they forgot the tobiko and the slices of tuna and salmon on top were literally so thin you could see through them. Not very good and too large to easily eat. I ordered the Philly Roll also, which is usually one of my go to favorites. I asked for light cream cheese, just a bit.  I am pretty sure they gave me 3x the normal amount of cream cheese and literally a teeny piece of smoked salmon. It was very tiny.  I most likely would not order the sushi again. \nMy husband ordered the SMASH BALL BURGER $14 SMASHED BALL OF FIRE OVER MELTED CHEDDAR CHEESE BURGER, LETTUCE, TOMATO, AND BIG GUP SAUCE. Sounds really good right? It was okay....it really didn't taste very fresh and the SMASHED BALL OF FIRE was significantly underwhelming. The fries were good though. \nOverall, I'd give it another try, there were so  many other things on the menu that looked yummy to me and we did like the atmosphere and service.",

  "text": "I know I shouldn't judge a place for something they're not known for, but I'm about to do it. My boyfriend and I went to Lafayette Square for a house tour yesterday and wanted to get brunch beforehand. Square One's brunch menu sounded really good, so I made an OpenTable reservation the night before. We were seated quickly, and the service was generally stellar throughout the experience. Unfortunately, the food was not. We ordered a Belgian waffle to share which was okay, but not outstanding. I don't know if it needed more butter in the batter or what, but it is not often that I am dissatisfied by a waffle. The real trouble came with my main dish. I ordered the Irish Skillet (I think that's what it was called) which was supposed to be corned beef hash with eggs. I am a CBH aficionado, so I was very much looking forward to it. Upon taking my first bite, my excitement dwindled. I kid you not...the hash was so spicy my nose was running after two or three bites. I have no idea why it was so spicy because the menu mentioned nothing about heat in the dish. Granted, I absolutely LOVE spicy food and the idea of hot corned beef hash is kind of intriguing, but this was so spicy that it was painful. It was the kind of spicy that you regret, and I did. I asked our waitress what made it so hot, and she said it normally wasn't and they must have over-seasoned it. Even before we got up to leave, I knew that heat would haunt me during our house tour, and it did. I had heartburn and indigestion for most of the day which really sucked. I have rarely in my life wasted food, but I didn't even take my leftovers as it was just too hot and my stomach was already upset. Generally, if I order really spicy food, I know there is a possibility I will suffer for it. What sucks is I didn't order spicy food, at least according to the menu. I will be back in the future to try the beer, but I will most certainly be skeptical if I'm ever ordering food again.",

  "text": "I just had a bad enough experience that I downloaded the yelp app, and created a log in just to be able to share. \n\nWe arrived at 11:26, the restaurant doesn't open until 11:30, but the door was unlocked so we walked in to get out of the 28 degree weather. The gentleman behind the bar said they aren't open to please leave. \n\nWe stood on the side walk for the four minutes until they opened and went back in. We were seated and ordered relatively quickly. The food took nearly an hour to come out and when it did oh boy. The pizzas two members of our party ordered were pretty terrible. One was burnt on the top, and both tasted like cardboard. \n\nI ordered the muscles appetizer, a side of Brussels sprouts, and a side of sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were okay enough-nothing remarkable. The Brussels sprouts were drenched in butter and were soggy. The muscles were sprinkled with slices of sausage that were so dry they looked like they were sandpaper. Onions also peppered across the muscles somehow burnt and shriveled but slimy all at once. The muscles themselves did not look appetizing at all. The broth they were in tasted like nothing and really bad all at once, It looked murky and not appetizing in the slightest. \n\nI asked our server for the check and nicely explained that none of us were pleased with our food and we wouldn't be eating it we would just like to get the check and leave. She offered something else and I politely declined again letting her know we waited nearly an hour and the food was not worth eating for us.\n\nWe were the only table in the entire restaurant and still received food that was well below acceptable standards.\n\nShe brought the check for the full table of food that we were unable to eat and had taken 20% off. We were still charged $45 for food that was so bad we couldn't even eat it. She did give us a coupon for a free appetizer, which was left behind because we will not be going back, and we will be telling others about our experience.",

Luckily after waiting on hold for hours and hitting nothing but dead ends.. The Inn At East Beach told us they had a room available! They got us right in with our handicap patient and took the best care of us! Their handy man Mike was very friendly and very helpful. From 7:30am-9:30am they have bread, muffins, seasonal fruit, and they usually always have fresh coffee brewed. We took advantage of their laundry room available near the pool with laundry soap available for purchase. Our room's heating source was a built in fireplace that turned on by a knob/thermostat (It made me want one in my house.) Our room was a junior sweet and came equipped with a kitchenette, including an oven, stovetop, apartment size fridge, silverware, plates, pots & pans, etc. Fully stocked and ready for whatever you may need! The staff was decorating the lobby's Christmas tree and using glitter to make presents. Vanessa was very nice and Maria went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of, she checked us right in and ensured us we had a welcoming place to stay after being evacuated from the fire. She provided us with masks and everything you could ever need to have a wonderful stay. I highly recommend the Inn At East Beach, the staff and the location is worth it if you're staying here in Santa Barbara. They will take good care of you!!",

Money well spent! \n\nWe all pondered how many lights there were total wrapped around tree trunks and branches and lights clinging to wrought iron fences. Has to be in the millions, easily.\n\nThe choreographed lights in front of Lilly House was a delight to watch. However I wished they had mixed up the music a bit, straying from the Nutcracker Suite (which I think they only played 'Waltz of the Flowers' over and over again). I think some more upbeat music every now and again would have added energy to the event.\n\nI like the small details that went into creating this experience. One would be the warming stations that weren't generic gas lamps, but rather real stoves fueled by wood. Very nice touch and right next to the treat stand. Eat and be warm. Good combo.\n\nThe kissing arbor was a big hit! There was a volunteer standing by to assist with photos. How often does someone offer to take your pic!! \n\nMy absolute favorite part was Snowflake Bridge, the first sight you see walking into the display. It was so angelic and lots of dimension. I wanted to stand there forever and look up at the trees. \n\nIF YOUR EYES HURT BY LOOKING AT BLUE LIGHTS, YOU HAVE AN OCULAR DISEASE... WARNING!!\nThere is a section near the big tree made of children's toys that is alllllllll blue lights. I literally couldn't even walk through that area. \n\nI could say about 20 more great things about the evening we spent at Winterlights, but I will leave some for your surprise and delight. Enjoy!",

The biscuits you get before your meal were hot & fresh. You get peach, blackberry, and strawberry preserves to go on them. (We bought some biscuit mix & blackberry preserves in the gift shop while we waited to be seated.) For our meal we split the southern sampler (fried chicken, catfish, and meatloaf.) The chicken and catfish were great but the meatloaf was pretty average. Don't waste your meal on the meatloaf when there's plenty of other good things on the menu. The hashbrown casserole and mac&cheese were both really good for sides. This place reminded me of cracker barrel but with more history. Would definitely go back.",

She's kind and knows so much about each product--how it is made, who made it, etc. in the era of same-day Amazon and Target it is so great to have someplace to go like Hey, Rooster.\n\nShe carries Inkkas (a great sneaker), has beautiful cards that might as well be artwork, and great jewelry).",

  "text": "Four of us went for Dinner. We ordered the Steak kabob, Pulled Pork platter, Chicken sandwich, and Ribs appetizer. The sides were french fries, mashed potatoes and gravy, and green beans. Conclusion: the green beans seemed to be canned. They were mushy and had no flavor except a bit of bacon. The fries ordinary at best. Same with the mashed potatoes. Pulled pork was Okay, as was the Chicken sandwich. Nothing special. The Kabob was much too salty and the meat gristly. The ribs were excellent, fall off the bone, moist and no fat. A challenger for best in Reno.\n\nThe ordeal of waiting in the crowds, even with the advance call in, and the noise, that makes it impossible to hear your table mates across the table, creates a truly undesirable dining experience.\n\nWe will not be returning. BJ's BBQ has better food, all around, and a pleasant atmosphere. So far it's our Go To BBQ place.",

  "text": "Extremely small space and long waits but the food made up for it. My boyfriend, friend, and I stopped in for brunch on a Saturday at 11:30. We had to wait about 45 minutes before getting the table, and were tempted by the Jamaican joint a block down the street, but decided to wait it out for hearty brunch food. Once we were inside we definitely waited awhile to give our order and get our food; service wasn't the best, but they were understandably very busy.\nThe food was, in one word, satisfying. Unable to decide between sweet or savory, i decided to get both with my friend. We ordered the short rib special, shakshuka, and pumpkin French toast. My personal favorite was the shakshuka. The tomatoey, soupy sauce was hearty and perfectly flavored, perfect on the toasted bread. The pumpkin French toast did not disappoint my sweet tooth, with the fluffy pumpkin toast meshing beautifully with the cream and caramel sauce. My boyfriend got the salmon bagel, which is a good pick if you're looking for something light and fresh. The cucumbers and sauce was refreshing with the thick slices of salmon on a toasted everything bagel. Can't go wrong with a salmon bagel. All in all, Little Spoon Cafe is a great lunch joint, though be prepared to wait if you come for brunch on a weekend.",

Good for VERY basic stuff but not granular level\n\nThe car I was having cleaned probably hasn't been cleaned on the inside for 5-6 years if I had to guess. \n\nGot the M5 which is inside and outside. They have more expensive packages. It says it takes an hour but they quoted 90 minutes which was fine. Keep in mind if you go beyond the morning it can be multiple hours even in freezing weather bc we are a vain society? Lol\n\nM5 is $119 which is $130 after tax and $150 after tip. I'd rather go get 2 temps or day laborers and give them 45 minutes and $50-$75 each and I'm pretty sure they'd do a better job.\n\nThis place is good if you need a quick wash/detail aka hasn't been cleaned in 3 years minimum. \n\nService was stellar just FYI but service isn't what I'm taking home.\n\nThey did it as estimated and I saw a few spots inside that I assumed were tough to get out bc again this car hasn't been cleaned in a long time. Nothing big. I'd say the equivalent of a few pimple size spots here and there. I gave them the BENEFIT OF DOUBT. I'm sure if I cared enough they would've tried to get it out but what was discovered after was so basic stuff you'd assume wouldve been taken care of originally. \n\nMy brother takes a look at the car and had some cheap wipes from Walmart for $2.84 and I ended up using 6 and the photo you see is evidence of how poor of a job they did. High level they do great work but anything beyond no way is $150 worth it. He LIGHTLY rubbed the seats and dash and they were all filthy. Some spots were visible like coffee drops here and there which i admit were hard to catch but just evidence of how once again they are great for a quick clean but NOT detailed for $150\n\nWhat makes it worse is that even if they offered a follow up I'd have to give up more of my day once again as I'm not in a position to do drop off service.\n\nThe fact that these Walmart wipes were barely used and filthy is where I do not have trust with Miles.

I'm never a fan of navigating downtown Nashville traffic, but last night the dinner was well worth it!  Four of us ate here yesterday evening to celebrate my husband's birthday and there was PLENTY of cheese and chocolate to go around.  A little goes a long way with fondue, so I'd recommend sharing when possible.  \n\nThe Melting Pot's menu is large, which is definitely helpful as the four of us had very different cravings.  We started out with the Fiesta fondue, which was a little less spicy than I wanted, but it was very good. When it came to ordering my entree I was pleasantly surprised to find they had a delicious vegetarian platter that had artichoke, asparagus, tofu and edamame.  I'd known that Melting Pot had a good variety of tasty meats but since I've been trying to eat ease my carnivorous ways, it helped that I had other options at hand.  Our server seemed fairly new and not terribly knowledgeable about the menu, but he was so friendly that it didn't matter.\n\nEven though I'd convinced myself that I was too full for dessert, I gobbled down the dark chocolate fondue with lots of bananas, brownies, strawberries and pond cake.  It was too delicious to resist.\n\nGetting a reservation on the weekend was a little harder since they were busy, so I'd say try to come during the week!

  "text": "A TOTAL RIP OFF. Aside from a clean and well kept facility, this place is seriously a rip off. One thing I miss about living in Los Angeles are the laundromats. I've been to this laundromat (Laundry on Pantano) twice since moving to Tucson and this second time around was the worse experience I've ever had in all of my years of going to laundromats. For starters, they charge $3.00 for the laundry card  cause of the chip on the card. You must only use the card to feed the machines (no coins). That in itself just swayed me the wrong way (the $3.00 for the card). Washers and dryers are ridiculously expensive, it was almost $6.00 for a 4 load washer. What really tipped me over was the big industrial sized dryers. I had to dry blankets and I placed just two blankets in one of these industrial sized dryers (.90/10mins) and after $4.00 having gone into that dryer, my blankets STILL weren't dried. The worker explained to me AFTER my third Dollar, that when I insert the laundry card, it's a good idea to press 10 mins into the dryer, take the card out, do another 10 mins, take care out and do it again (if I want 30 mins) AND THEN start the dryer.  Cause if you run the dryer just for 10 mins every $.90, it wont dry thoroughly cause your getting 8 mins of dry time and 2 mins cool down, its best to run the dryer more than 10 mins. AND THAT I HAD NO IDEA OF. I wish it was notated somewhere by the dryers after having fed my dryer $3.00...idk i spent dang near $40 on washing 5 blankets and 6 pillow cases. Ridiculous! I'm sorry but I won't be back at this laundromat ever again.",

You can tell they are trying to be like chipotle or moes but in my opinion they just aren't quite there.

  "text": "Wasn't the best sushi buffet I've ever been to, wasn't the worst. But in my opinion if my favorite thing was the crepe station for dessert, that's a problem at a seafood and sushi buffet.\n\nThe sushi itself was decent-I really liked the rice it was perfectly cooked. My favorite was this vegetarian sushi that had beet rice with avocados, carrots and cucumber. The spicy shrimp and the shrimp tempura was also amazing. Some of the other rolls I tried made me want to puke, but that's probably personal taste over certain types of seafood. I don't like much raw fish, so I skipped those options.\n\nThey had snow crab legs, which my fiancé loved and while I thought they were okay, I'm not a fan of them ice cold so I barely had any. \n\nTheir fried and grilled entrees and hibachi station were decent. I loved their beef teriyaki and butterfly shrimp. The hibachi beef and veggies we sampled was just ok but I think I could've made it myself and made it more flavorful.\n\nThe dessert was the best part (again, I think that's problematic at a seafood place). The crepe station was awesome and they had so many different fillings. Their soft serve ice cream is also really really good, which is rare at buffets. We both had two servings! They have some other little cookies and cakes but I didn't try too many of those. \n\nThe service was good, our waiter was on top of refilling our water and if you want this place is BYOB so that's also nice if you want to bring alcohol. \n\nOverall, I just don't think this place is good for $32.99 a person. I would expect it to be amazing and it was just eh. We left a bit disappointed.",

My sister-in-law and I split the crab cakes and crabmeat Karen (we couldn't decide) and it was a toss up as to which was better.

She didn't do small sections like the other waxers, instead she did huge sections. I had Wax all over me. Just strings all over my stomach. EVERYWHERE. I had to peel it off and hand it to her. Overall she is nice however, if I can save someone their money I would 100% not recommend for a Brazilian Wax. I usually just bounce around and take any waxer I can get but this was just horrible.

  "text": "We had such a great experience shopping for a motor home with salesman Dave W.  He was knowledgeable, asked pertinent questions and showed us only what we'd expressed interest in.  We found \"the one\" Jayco Greyhawk. The buying process was a bit more challenging as we wanted to do our own financing and that I'd definitely not what the dealership prefers.  When we got to the dealership to pick the motor home up, the troubles began.  The RV had not been \"gone through with a fine tooth comb\"- the door lock on the coach was rusted and the key didn't work, the armrest on the passenger seat didn't work... in hindsight, we should have left the RV there for them to fix, but alas, we'd paid for it and wanted to take it home!  The service department was a nightmare to work with and the worst part is that NOBODY calls you back... the customer service is terrible, because nobody calls back! Being in the service industry myself, it's frustrating to be treated so poorly and ignored.  Phone calls are easy.  Returning phone calls is easy- if it weren't for Dave W., Marnie B, and Crystal T., we wouldn't ever return to Bish's.  We love our motor home, but we sure hope nothing goes wrong with it and we need (further) help with it.",

  "text": "Shot down to Tucson for a few days and was able to catch two Breweries that have long been on my list - Borderlands and Pueblo Vita.  I've been a fan of NE Style IPAs and Toole Ave by Borderlands has been one of my favs for a while now.  The Clever Koi and Total Wine up in the Gilbert/Chandler area have both been carrying it and I've been drinking it as fast as I can.  I've also heard great things about their German Chocolate Cake (from the whining pig) which I was surprised to find a porter, not a stout.  \n\nOn arrival, I found a laid back and comfy bench style seating and barstools gathered around a good sized bar.  The tender was not a young kid and had a great knowledge of the brews they had and was very welcoming and fun to talk to.  He helped us score some good pizza from around the corner and eventually walked me through all of their beers.  I did a flight and really enjoyed all 5 brews.  I did go back to the Toole Ave which I just love so much but would have been happy with any of the 5 I tasted.    \n\nCool artwork is scattered throughout the place and some of it is for sale.  Bathrooms are locking and very large and were clean.  They had a few sandwiches behind the bar but also are stocked with a ton of local menus who deliver.  The music was just my style but others in our group were caught whining most likely because they jamming in the 80's to Menudo and not the punk I was.  I heard some DK, Clash, Sex Pistols, and Circle Jerks which I've not heard in quite a while.  Fun!\n\nI hear they have great live music but we were day drinking so we missed it.  Great outdoor area if you want to grab a pint outside as well.  Nothing but nice and chill people were boozin here and we met a lot of fun and interesting peeps - even a few pups (they are very dog-friendly) \n\nAfter hitting a few other places I can say that Borderlands was comfy, cool, and know how to brew a great beer.  I'll be back when I head down South and hope to see more of their stuff in the Phx area.  Big cheers to their brew and layout.  A Tuscon winner for sure.",

  "text": "Let's start with 6oz burgers. When I go out for a burger, I want to go big, but not half-pound big - who invented that idea? Therefore, 6oz is a nice indulgent \"just right\" middle size. Burgers come in an English muffin, and while I appreciate a nice toasted brioche, I much prefer db's English Muffin - the bread does not overwhelm the burger.\n\nAh, the burger...perfectly cooked, and graced with green chiles, grilled onions, pesto, and an egg over easy (in my case - dbhouse plus the chiles and onions). The frites are pretty good too, but I am not a fry fanatic; while I put a dent in the pile, the portion was big for me, whereas my kiddo and hubs ate theirs to the bottom. They have malt vinegar (available on request) so I got to scratch a little British-chip-shop itch that came out of nowhere. \n\nThe kid burger was a little small for our 9yo - it's half-size, and he could have eaten a full-size. 2/3 might be just right. Still, it's a good option.\n\nPrices: Tucson seems to be able to support $13-15 burgers, and that's where we are, paying for good quality. Total bill is not your typical burger joint bill, but this isn't your typical burger joint.\n\nBeers: selection is small but solid. We both had Deep Canyon Amber. Delish, especially as I ran the Tucson Marathon in the morning and had really earned it! At $6/pint, it's overpriced. \n\nOverall - we will be back! Great burgers, fun atmosphere and we enjoyed chatting with the other people at our table. It's kid-friendly too.",

I like spicy sausage, basil, tomatoes, white sauce, mushrooms, & asiago. I should have added ricotta too! Oh and I can never turn down pesto. You walk along the assembly line towards the register as you add items to your pizza. I've been to one of these pizza concept places before but the pizza here is better. If you want a beer with your pizza, they got you covered. I like that they have a few different sizes. You can come for snack size or medium personal size. Decent prices and the pizza is ready in no time! This place gets busy. They don't have enough seats for people to take their time to chat. I got up after I finished so that someone else can sit down. Bus your own trays.",

I especially enjoyed the Brussels sprouts and the artichoke \"crab\" cakes. The soup was excellent as well. We need more restaurants like this in Santa Barbara.",

No one had the answer until Stephanie from this Enterprise Dealership stepped in and confidently assured me it is a common problem & her 10 yrs experience could handle this quickly & she did!! What should have happened 3 months ago she resolved in 10 days. Not to mention how pleasant and happy she is. Any referrals I have will go to her for sure. She made this place look \"golden\"",

We decided to eat here as well. There are two options for eating. You can find your own table next to the gaming area on the floor or head to the back area that has restaurant style service where you are seated by staff. We initially opted to find our own table but after waiting with 2 other parties for a clean table for more than 15 minutes we decided to go in the restaurant area. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. The food was not good. It taste like warm frozen food. The kids barely finished. We spent $80 on food which was a waste! Next time we will eat elsewhere and just visit the gaming area. We had 3 little ones and the each had the $23 cards. They were able to play a lot of the games and had a lot of fun. My recommendation is to go to play, don't go to eat!",

It's taken me a long time to finally try it (namely due to their long waitlist for a reservation and I'm more of a last minute person). If you're like me and have a hard time making a reservation a month in advance come by and try it on a Monday like I did where I had no trouble getting a table. Every choice you have to make is difficult but if the entire wait staff is anything like our waitress on Monday then they do a great job guiding you through your experience. The cocktail menu is complex and creative, where their beer selection is certainly not lacking either. We chose the blue crab dip appetizer which comes highly recommended by both the staff and Yelpers alike. While their menu changes daily the blue crab dip never waivers. It was just as good as advertised with a creamy flavorful dip atop soft pretzel bread slices. Our waitress also brought us slices of Union Loafers bread (mad love for Union Loafers) with honey, cracked pepper, and salted butter sooo delicious! For our entrees my dad had the beef tenderloin which was perfectly cooked and tender atop a beautiful polenta. I had the rabbit pot pie which had a beautiful flaky crust and absolutely delicious! We finished our meal with the much raved about butterscotch pot de crème. It had a delicious granola topping that added a wonderful cinnamon finish. I'm so sold on this restaurant and it's already a new favorite!",

The fire roasted carrots are always a family favorite. The sweet papas bravas stole the show!!! It was truly amazing!!! One of my all time favorites. As our main entree we got the crispy avocado rice with chicken. It was awesome! We ended the night with a the butternut squash ice cream cake. It was a beautiful dessert and tasted even better. Tonight was truly, delectably exquisite!!!!",

  "text": "A friend & I went on a Saturday night, about 500ish, it was not busy, maybe 3 other tables w/people. Interesting decor. We ordered the Mini bang bang shrimp, which was pretty good, & a tuna roll(so-so), as appetizers.  I had a Delaware roll & a tuna roll, as my main course. The Delaware roll was good, the tuna rolll was bland. It was supposed to come with a side salad & miso soup, but the waitress forgot for several minutes. When she brought the salad, it was very cold- like it just came out of the refrigerator. And it was not good, it was basically just bland iceberg lettuce, shredded carrots, and some kind of orangey dressing. The miso soup was tasteless- it seemed mostly water and after a few minutes separated into 2 layers in the bowl...I've never seen soup do that!  My friend had chicken curry, with rice, he said it was good, but had to ask for another plate to eat it on - the curry was served in a bowl, the rice on a small plate. Strange.  \n  All in all, it was an okay place, I may go back for sushi, but not get any salad or miso soup.",

Started with the Coconut Tom Kah - a delicious coconut broth chock full of fresh mushrooms, red pepper, onions, and chicken.  Absolutely wonderful.  I chose the avocado salad for the appetizer and although the ginger dressing was tasty, the avocado was severely unripe and rock hard.  Disappointing.  My entree was the Panang curry with chicken - amazing!  Full of tender chicken and fresh vegetables and absolutely perfectly spiced.  Ample portions and very reasonably priced.

  "text": "We go to this theatre every time we're in Reno. Not necessarily because its the closest or because we like it the best, but because when we look at all the local theatres, it always seems to have the movies we're looking for and at good times. I decided to write a review because the fact that we always end up here says to me they are current, convenient and reasonable but I also noticed on our last visit, we got decent to good customer service. \nMy friend used a girft card for his ticket and even though we purchased together, they used his card and then let us put the rest on credit with no attitude. Doesn't seem like much but a lot of employees get snarky when you use gift cards and coupons, so that was nice. Then, he also used a gift card for his consessions, which were also totaled with mine and not only was the consessions guy nice and helful about it, but he let us use a coupon in addition the the gift card. He was patient and very friendly. \nThe consessions area itself is a bit confusing and the theatre should put up signs for a start line, but all the staff were nice so it was fine. The theatre was clean enough and comfy and eventhough there were annoying giggling girls seated behind us and a guy on his phone in the middle of the movie in front of us, I can't hold them responsible for the thoughtless people who might patronize their establishment. \nI am sure we will continue to use this theater whenever we are in Reno.",

We thought Seaworthy looked like a nice little spot to duck in, though it was obviously a cocktail bar and we weren't sure if they were still serving food. Lucky for us, they had a late night food menu available from 11pm-1am.\n\nWe actually didn't order any drinks, and instead got a half a dozen raw oysters and split the burger. The oysters were very fresh from the east, west, and gulf coasts, and average about $3 each, which I found to be higher than what's typically charged at home. The burger was 8oz of half brisket, half beef chuck, which I asked for mid-rare. It was cooked perfectly and had fontal cheese, roasted ham, and garlic aioli in a brioche bun, with a side of seaweed seasoned fries and spicy pickles. It was absolutely delicious, and the fries were crispy, well-seasoned, and actually ended up being a larger portion than we thought. We asked for some garlic aioli on the side for dipping for fries, and it made our meal all the more droolworthy.\n\nUnexpectedly fantastic meal, friendly service, vibe is trendy, and extra points for the late-night mood lighting.",

  "text": "Got there to find that you no longer need to put your name down for a table but to seat yourself. So we had a party of 6 squeezed into a booth made for 4. We were gonna accept it since the place was packed and you had to fight for a place to eat here. But then a miracle happened and a larger booth opened up. We already gotten out food but the waitress was really nice and let us move since it was still in her zone. No biggie. But then the service was not up to par. She only bought us one set of silverware. I figured she just put the one down to go and get 5 more. Nope. So we had to ask for plates and more silverware. She brings us the other half of our order and says she'll come back with the plates and silverware. Brings me my drink. By this time we almost done eating. No napkins. Ended up stealing a batch from the bar. No silverware. No plates. Finally she brings plates and silverware. But she only bought 4 silverware sets/napkins and 5 plates. We have a party of 6. You do the math. Then she disappears for the rest of our meal. We don't see her again. We ended up having to hunt her down to ask for our check. Also note that before all this we were almost given someone else's order. The people delivering it totally looked lost. \n\nThis place is still running around with its head cut off. I noticed that there is an entire area in the back that they closed. Then you have people hoarding tables while their brats run around to play games. If they are not actively order a continuous food/drink I think they are done. Maybe give em a hint by giving them the check. Just saying. \n\nAlso, if you parked in the garage they only have pay Stations on the first and 6th Floor. That's makes a whole lotta sense. People can either go down to the first floor pay for parking and then go back upstairs to whatever floor they parked on. That's not enough elevators for all that foot traffic. Or you can pay for parking before leaving the 6th floor where people are lined up to buy cards for the games and the foot traffic from the elevators. So now you adding to the foot traffic as well.

  "text": "Is it just my imagination, or is the standard of Asian fare in Nashville improving? Last night we went to Korea House after checking the reviews on Yelp. \n\nThe restaurant itself is small, a bit tired in a very Asian sort of way, and packed to the rafters with hungry, mostly Korean, diners. This is always a good sign in a Korean restaurant. We were seated quickly and the waitress was quick to bring our menus and drinks.\n\nWe ordered a typical Korean barbeque. While it wasn't of the strict Yaki Niku variety (it was pre-cooked rather than delivered raw to be cooked over an inset BBQ grill on the table) it was truly very good. There was a variety of pickles, vegetables and loads of meat and fried onions.\n\nWe had been on the road all day and, after a late lunch, we weren't particularly hungry. The portion served for one was huge and was more than enough food for us both. The price was very low considering the quality and freshness of the food.\n\nThe only drawback I noted was the available space. There is simply not enough. We were shoe-horned into chairs behind a well worn table. Behind me on the next table was a small child. Behind my wife on her side of the table, was another small child. I had to sit with the back of my chair perpendicular to the wall to fit in my spot, my wife fared little better.\n\nOne less table in this tiny restaurant would make all the difference...unless you are a shorty weighing around 100lbs. We will go back. If it is crowded we would not go in; if it is not so crowded you couldn't keep us out.\n\nThe food, price and service are excellent. The room is crowded and noisy.\nBut, it's good overall.",

  "text": "This review is mostly for the food, which is among the most authentic in all of St. Louis. Here is a dish by dish breakdown (no pics cuz we devoured everything asap!): \n\n- Soup dumpling - 4.5/5. Paper-thin wrapping, fragrant filling with the perfect amount of soup in each dumpling. They are bite-sized but those bites will be among the most delicious you'll ever take. \n\n- Lion head meatball - 3/5. Generous amount of meat per serving, but tasted a little bland. Comes floating in a bowl of watery, flavorless broth.\n\n- Squirrel fish - 3.5/5. Visually stunning, drizzled in sweet and sour sauce. It's a whole fish that's been flayed and cubed with all the meat still attached and then deep fried. Wasn't my cup o' tea (or cup o' fish) but it's certainly a crowd pleaser. \n\n- House beef in chef's sauce - 4/5. Gorgeous plating with a tiny figurine of a bull. Sauce was deliciously savory with a hint of sweetness, but a little heavy-handed for my taste. After a few bites it started to get a little salty, but definitely worth trying. \n\n- Peking duck - 4/5. Meat is well cooked, tender, with perfectly crisped skin. Served with steam buns, sliced scallions, and plum sauce to make your own little duck buns. This is really the highest rating I can bestow to Peking duck in the US, having eaten the real deal in Beijing which has forever ruined me. \n\n- Three ingredient vegetables - 3.5/5. And FYI the 3 veggies are eggplant, bell pepper, and potato. Stir fried in a slightly spicy brown sauce, it's quite a tasty dish, but again just a tad salty. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, it is imperative that you text the phone number on their fb page ahead of time to not only reserve a table but also place your order. \n\nIt will be a struggle if no one in your group can speak/text fluent Mandarin. Thankfully hubby was up for the task, as my broken Chinglish just wasn't gonna cut it. \n\nService is limited to bringing you food and check; the experience is mainly for the food. They don't serve liquor here but I believe my group was able to bring our own for a small fee. \n\nWill update when I try their other dishes!",

But I really did not like the food. I ordered the breakfast bowl during brunch and it was just too weird tasting for me and had too many pungent flavors, especially heavy on the mustardy flavor. The biscuit was very dry and the multiple sauces did not go well together. The tofu had the weirdest taste of all. I did not enjoy this dish at all. My husband ordered the potato bowl which was better with more familiar flavors of sour cream and salsa. But it was just so average and not tasty either.

  "text": "I think I'm hooked. I've been itching to go to one of Ballet Idaho's shows for years, and I am thrilled that my first experience was with the Christmas classic, The Nutcracker. \n\nThere were so many components of this performance that won me over--the combination of professional dancers performing with children from Ballet Idaho's Academy, the live music played by the Boise Philarmonic, and the contrast of beautiful dancing paired with humorous bits that got the whole audience chuckling. \n\nIn my opinion, the first act is mostly storytelling, whereas the second act features the more complex dance pieces. I enjoyed both parts equally and thought that they combined to make for a dreamy entertainment experience--one that was both intelligent and humorous.\n\nThe entire show had me pulled in with the same wide-eyed wonder my friend's three-year-old daughter had. I think that is perhaps my favorite part of this whole experience, the feel in the building is so child-like. Before and after the show and during intermission, the lobby of the Morrison Center was buzzing with people of all ages. And during intermission, the top balcony overlooking the lobby outside of the auditorium had a group of grade-school kids singing Christmas carols. \n\nTo put the cherry on top of an already amazing evening, as soon as we stepped out of the building, we experienced our first Boise snowfall of the year. Talk about magical, eh?\n\nPro Tip: If you are parking in the garage right outside of the Morrison Center, try to get there a little early and get a space on the first floor. We parked on the second floor and it took us about half an hour to get out. Eeeeeep.",

  "text": "I've been eating here since I moved back to Boise in 2009 and the prices have skyrocketed in that time. That would be fine if the quality hadn't gone downhill so badly. The salad greens on the salad bar are obviously from a bag and they aren't fresh. The choice is on the salad bar have gone down as well just not nearly as many as there used to be it's mostly pre-made salads now. \n \nI was there the other night on the sushi was warm, not good. My salt and pepper shakers were gross as well. I don't know what's going on but somebody should know about this and fix it. Still I will say that the meat and the grilled pineapple are out of this world! Lots of choices and they're awesome about bringing back the things that you prefer. The kids on the floor or just awesome.\n\nI do want to mention that this last visit was the 29th of November when I walked in the host asked me if I wanted to sit in the bar to which I replied no and then he tried to seat me in the bar. I told him no and asked him if I could have a half and half table. You know, the ones with half bench and on the other side a chair. There were plenty of seats that night that were available and he ignored me and put me at a table by the window. I was not in the mood to argue so I just took it. When I mentioned it to my server she gave me a blank stare and then completely ignored what I had said and asked me what I wanted to drink. Management really needs to take a closer look at the restaurant and the employees. For $25 I should not have had an experience like that.",

Thanks, Sarah S., for your continual spot-on restaurant selection.\n\nEl Agave is in Watson Plaza, a large, C-shaped shopping center, with Kohl's at the top (facing west), Shop 'n Save facing Watson and El Agave at the bottom (facing east). Just turn in when you see Kohl's.\n\nThis may be the largest Mexican restaurant I've ever patronized. There's a lovely separate bar and numerous smallish dining areas.\n\nOur server was pleasant and knowledgeable of the menu. I asked him for a recommendation, and that's what I got. But I don't know its name. The menu is sporting a picture of it. Nopales are involved.\n\nAnd this massive, wonderful dish was served in a huge black \"pottery\" footed bowl lined with foil. Besides nopales, there was chicken, shrimp, pico, sour cream and vegetables . . . no doubt other things.\n\nThis was the first time in my life I've had a Mexican dish that didn't include tortillas. And that includes Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, Cancun and all villages down the road from Cancun to Tulum and up the road from Mexico City to Taxco.\n\nAnd I was more than ecstatic with that.\n\nDang-bang it, was that good and continued to be fabulous with the abundance in my to-go vessel.\n\nIt was a fun evening with fellow Yelpers. Service was just right. Water was replenished in a timely fashion. And it seemed like everyone was pleased with their selections.",

Jim was always available if needed and I never had any issues in the 2 years I lived there. I will definitely rent another property from them if I move back to the Reno area.",

  "text": "Stopped at Vitarelli's for take-out since we were staying overnight at a local hotel. What a great find! Instead of the pizza we'd planned, we ordered delicious dinners to go. Try the stuffed shells-the portion is more than enough (some is in the frig for later!)- and the salad, bread,butter made me feel as if I'd been at my grandmother's for dinner. The other take-out dinner was the Baked Ziti with Eggplant. So much delicious food!!\n\nThe extra special treatment we received by the Vitarelli's staff was incredibly kind-- when they realized we were \"on the road\" they packed up utensils, napkins, extra Parmesan, pepper, butter, etc What a sweet and neighborly gesture.  \n\nWe are annual visitors to this area; we'll be back for the best Italian food we've had since dinner at Grandma's.",

I highly recommend the beets and the collard greens. \n\nAs for dessert, the chocolate chess pie is like fudge with a pie crust, it's amazingly chocolatey and smooth, with a flaky, beautiful crust.",

The catalogue headers give a good idea of the breadth available: cooking and baking, crafts and handiwork, dance, mind and body, music, photography, pottery and sculpture, silversmithing, soaps and lotions, theatre, visual art, and writing.\n\nThe hunnybunny has done some silversmithing, pottery (pix added to this review), and painting, and we've done a cooking class together. There's a lot you can use to distract yourself from a particularly heavy snowstorm :-)\n\nThe classes have been well planned and leave you with a nice artifact to commemorate your new (or growing) skill. The teachers personalities vary, so not all students will click with all teachers, but the centre seems pretty responsive in allowing switching between classes.",

  "text": "As one of the premier Italian options in South Tampa, Bella's has been a favorite of mine since I was a wee lad. We have gathered for numerous celebrations here over the years, simply because the atmosphere is cozy, the service is excellent, and the food is so delicious and never, ever disappoints. The small bruschetta sample plate they bring as a taster at the beginning of the meal sets the tables: The topping is fresh and vibrant, and we always end up ordering more! The carpaccio is another delicious starter as well, the aioli served with the paper-thin steak is a revelation. Try to treat yourself to one of their delicious caesar salads while you wait for your mains. My all time favorite dinner option there is Nate's Chicken. TWO gigantic chicken breasts topped with prosciutto, mozzarella and marsala sauce with sautéed spinach. I always opt to add a side of the wood fired roasted potatoes as well, as they compliment the dish and go great with the sauce. Other favorites are the Pollo Milano, Bella Luna and Grouper Picatta. If you have any room left (and your probably won't), they have an array of delicious desserts, my favorite of which is the Tiramisu. Pair that with a nice cup of coffee and you, my friend, have just had one of the finest Italian meals in the South Tampa area.",

So once they came out we went ahead and placed the order because we had been sitting for so long before the appetizers came now understanding that we had a big party of twelve however our waiter did not check on us hardly we had to keep looking for her the service was not to standard when you have a big party.  It took again another hour to get our food and by that time it was 9:45pm and on top of that the food was horrible everyone outside 3 ppl had the seafood platter the steaks were fresh and hot however the platters were all cold shrimp was soggy, heavy salted, and cold, fries were cold, and oysters were soggy and cold as well.  One of my staff members preceded tell one of the servers (Howard) was his name and he laughed directly in her face and walked away which was very unprofessional.  Once were able to get a manger she was very rude and didn't seem to care at all even though she refunded our meals and only charged us for the wings she didn't apologize or anything of that nature.

After the first bad meal, it took us a long time before deciding to give it another try. The second dinner was terrific. We were both so pleased with the food that we were looking forward to our next trip there. \n\nOn our third visit, as we entered the restaurant, the first thing we were asked was if we were using a Groupon. I have no idea if that determined where we were seated or even which menu we were given, but the question gave us pause. \n\nWhat I do know is that neither one of us had a good meal. My husband's fish was mushy -- I would not have eaten it. My lamb shanks were tender, but the sauce had an odd flavor and the vegetables looked and tasted like had been reheated too many times. \n\nWe also wondered if since we visited during the middle of the week that perhaps the chef was not working that night.

  "text": "I will never eat at this Domino's again after interacting with the \"manager,\" Josh, there, who wouldn't know customer service if it hit him upside the head.\n\nI don't expect anything to be done about it by leaving a review because review after review is posted for this store--almost all regarding the terrible service--and nothing has seemed to change.\n\nAfter nearly an hour and a half of not hearing a word from anyone and not receiving my order, I checked the tracker online to see the store had labeled my order as delivered and completed. I called the store only to wait nearly twenty minutes on hold. It was a Tuesday night in early December so it is unfathomable that they would be so busy someone would have to wait that long. I suspect the store knew who was calling and purposely tried to wait me out in a poor effort to get me to give up and hang up.\n\nMy suspicion was confirmed when Josh finally picked up because he immediately began ranting that he had tried to call me three times and that I was unreachable so the store wasn't responsible for my order as they didn't have the ingredients (supposedly ran out of pepperoni--really?) to complete it. I couldn't even get a word in. Nobody had called me three times. I didn't even know what he was talking about. More importantly, why call anyone three times instead of simply calling once and leaving a message? Is there really no policy to simply leave a message? That alone is baffling.\n\nHe sounded pissed and about ready to hang up on me. At this point my first and only priority was to get my money back as I hadn't received a thing from the store. He told me he had just then refunded me and then immediately hung up. No chance to even determine what happened.\n\nAfter this, I would never again step foot into another Domino's in my life if it wasn't for a delivery driver who called me about half an hour later, attempted to deliver leftovers from the store. This guy, who's name was Dan, seemed to be genuine and was willing to talk and listen regarding the issue earlier.\n\nWe concluded that another associate had called a number that wasn't mine three times by her own mistake before she \"left the store, pissed off.\" I assume that Josh, realizing her/their mistake later, then tried to task the delivery driver with amending the situation by delivering what was literally described as \"leftovers\" to me. I didn't accept them but thanked Dan for at least listening and trying to amend the problem. I will never go to this store again but will probably buy from Domino's again sheerly because of Dan's maturity.\n\nWhy someone as condescending and easy-to-anger as Josh is the manager while a guy like Dan is just the delivery driver is beyond me. As I said above, I don't expect anything at the store to change by leaving a review so at this point I'm just trying to warn other consumers to stay clear of a terribly-run store like this one. Buy pizza anywhere but here. It's just not worth an experience like this--being blamed for the store's own mistake and then getting hung up on, just lucky to get your money back after hours of waiting. You've been warned!",

We were meeting friends for drinks on 12-16-2017 (management look who was bar tending that night) and the bartender was the ABSOLUTE RUDEST bartender that I have ever encountered!!! That is a big statement! She had horrible body language, leaning back at the bar, slightly turning her head for the next person to order and shortly saying next, as if we were the most inconvenient people that actually want a drink FROM A BAR. We thought that we were just experiencing this for some weird reason until the next two people sat down. They asked if she had Blanton's (we had already looked for the price on the menu because that is a favorite in our group and it was not on the menu) the bartender quickly snapped back and said \"look at the menu, It would be there, AND the bottle is right there (pointed to it on the opposite side of the bar)\". Let me tell you, it was NOT on the menu and we had watched them look for it, both on the menu and in the massive stack of bottles. Now she could have handled every conversation (I mean attack) differently. We then made it a game after we ate to see if she still hated us after we ate dinner at a table, and dared our out of town friend to ask for a Togo beer. Same encounter, horrible person and if we were not meeting a group of friends there, I would have spoke to management that night, and if she is management, GOOK LUCK! If you go, don't sit at the bar, the waitress was nice, we will NEVER EVER EVER be back!",

My server was very friendly and helpful. I loved how the menu was divided into pork and non-pork sausage options. I had the beef bratwurst and a vegan sausage. The vegan sausage was hearty, totally nailed the texture, and had a slightly sweet taste to it. The beef bratwurst was incredible. I'm not a huge fan of beef sausages because I find they often taste like hot dogs, and I don't love hot dogs. However, this sausage had more of a texture and flavour reminiscent of a kofta kebab - ground beef with seasonings in a very thin casing. Intensely flavourful. For my side I had a small dill coleslaw, and it was extremely fresh without the dill being overpowering. The drink list was extensive but I was not in the mood for that, but will return again for that beef sausage and perhaps a libation.",

Take away all the signage that says Drug Store and most any Nashvillian walking in would finish their phone call with \"I have to hang up now. I'm about to get some coffee at [looks around for 0.77 seconds] Barista Parlor.\"\n\nI've been here yesterday and Josh said they were not opening for another day but [paraphrasing] you look like you're in withdrawal so have some of this coffee I made for myself.\n\nI won't go on about the attention to detail and the gorgeous execution since there is consistency among all their locations, but I have to point out that this particular location has the most feels like it belongs location of them all.  Heart of downtown.  Wide and tall windows unobstructed to accentuate that fact.\n\nThe barista was excited to be there, seemed passionate about barista'ing, made a decent Cortado.\n\nIt's downtown so parking is ... downtown.  \n\nThe hotel in which it is located, the newly opened Noelle, is beautiful and cosmopolitan much like the BP brand so the partnership seems like a match made in heaven.  Thanks for bringing Nashville up a notch as a world class city.",

The menu said the pancakes came with two eggs, but it only came with one. They were tepid when we received them. The pancake batter had not fully cooked so we could not eat those. The \"Belgian waffle\" was clearly just bland batter in a waffle press. If you can't do the basics well, you have no business serving breakfast or food for that matter.",

Burger was charred just right and every bite was juicy and tender - perfect!  Even the fries were hot out of the  fryer, so we didn't leave anything left on our plates to take home for the dog.  This evening they also had a smoked brisket soup that was tasty, creamy and chunky - did not go hungry tonight!  I did ask for some tomato and onion condiments, and they brought several fresh tomato slices and onion, super customer service!\n\nDefinitely check out their board specials when stopping here for a meal or cold one.

We told him we had only come too see the Honda.\nSalesman \"W\" said they will bring the car up for us in 15 minutes.\n15 minutes later salesman \"W\" said it would be quicker to go to the car instead of waiting for it to be brought up. \nWe followed Salesman \"A\" and drove another 15 minutes in our car to Marlton to test drive the car.\nAfter 15 minutes more at the Fiat dealership and nearly and hour in total spent with their staff we were told that the car had been sold earlier in the day, BUT MAYBE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING ELSE? \nDuring the process three different salesmen attempted too try to have us look at other cars that we did not want to see. \nEach time I had been asked about other cars I had informed each of the salesmen that we were only interested in seeing the Honda.\n\nIn short, the dealership staff was disorganized and seemingly incapable of locating a car that had actually been sold. They wasted an hour of our time knowing full well that we had only come to see one specific car. \n\nWe would never consider buying a car from this dealership, nor can I recommend it to family or friends. I've never seen more disorganization or more of a classic \"used car salesman\" approach and pressure from a dealership before.",

Just recently i called ldi and demanded to know what lies or pure laziness are you typing in your computer? Then I was told that the medication that I use for seizures so it is of great importance to not miss a dose for nearly 2 weeks one time. Anyway, the lady preceeded to tell me that the med has been sitting there w/o my knowledge of it as I had new rx for wal-mart. ldi had med ready and wariting there for 11 days. they did not bother to deliver or call and say that they had the medication. they r ringing up ik  their system without your knowledge so they cause you to look plain crwzy with the retail pharmacy. they make you look like your lying bcuz of theur crap. ldi is a horrible place to have to use bcuz your unsurance forces you to use them for certain meds. i would give them no stars if avail. they have the laziest staff as well. the girls up front are generally playing with their phones in their laps and ignore that ur there until they complete whatever it ois they are doing. they also take forever to fill medication. u can easily be sitting in their for 45 min b4 they have one script ready.

  "text": "On a cold Wednesday Nashville evening I found myself in need of dinner. Using a combination of Yelp and Open Table I was able to book a table for one at Gray & Dudley. I arrived about 30 minutes early but was able to sit at their fully stocked bar to have a pre dinner drink. I was impressed with their whisky variety as they went way beyond the local offerings with some nice scotches, Irish, and even a bottle of Kavalan (Taiwan). My table was soon available and I pretty much knew what I was going to order as I sat down.\n\nFood: Lots of great selections but I had my eye on the Crispy Pork Shank for a couple days now. I mean they combine two of my favorite culinary words that being Pork and Crispy..how could that not be great dish. My server warns me that it's quite a large portion but I assure her that I am up for the challenge. I also challenge her and the bartender to come up with a cocktail using a smoky scotch and they deliver a delish drink combo of Laphroig, Gin, and Bitters. The entree arrives and it's a sight to behold, that lovely piece of pork sitting on a bed of grilled Brussel sprouts. Brussel Sprouts are supposed to be very healthy right so I consider this dish to be partly vegetarian! It was very good, nicely crisped exterior, juicy tender porkiness under the skin...the sprouts were good as well and complemented it well. It wasn't as fatty as i thought and had wonderful flavor and texture. After that meal I had a little room for dessert so went with their special GD Cluster which was a GooGoo cluster made especially for them. While waiting for my dessert someone drops off a mound of fluffy, airy cotton candy...I was like how can this meal get any better..i know, have some on the house fresh cotton candy!\n\nServer: My server Emily was amazing, she's only been there a short while but she enhanced the evening greatly. She checked on me often, was super friendly (then again is that a southern thing), and really elevated the service experience to match the cuisine.\n\nAtmosphere: Nice restaurant that was down an alley way...seems like many restaurants in Nashville are down an alley so who am I to judge right.  Pretty large space with a nice bar,  I was seated in the back portion of the restaurant which I enjoyed because I had a view of the open kitchen. There's a blue penguin thing by the door..be sure to ask about that when. you dine at G&D.\n\nValue: Great value for the quality and service. Prices in general seem to be lower than other \"big\" cities and I've found food quality is on par with Chicago, San Francisco, and Manhattan. \n\nOverall: I'd recommend G&D to anyone going to Nashville, it's definitely worth a visit....just remember the words Crispy Pork!",

  "text": "Really disappointed in this place. I was greatly looking forward to trying their red beans & rice veggie burger, and was let down by both the food and the service.\n\nI dropped in on Halloween for some take-out. The place was packed and super loud, and I wanted to eat somewhere I could hear myself think. When I get up to the window, the guy makes me wait quite a while to order. Then I wait even longer for my food to arrive. Weird since there's only one other table of diners; most people are just drinking, because it's in a bar after all. \n\nWhen at last my burger arrives, in a brown bag toted by a young girl with a decidedly sullen attitude, it is smaller than expected and there's no sauce on it. None. Who the hell wants a burger, veggie or otherwise, with no flippin' mayo? Particularly when the menu proudly states that is comes dressed with tabasco aioli. \n\n\"There's no sauce on this,\" I say. \n\"Did you want some?\" asks the girl, as though baffled by such a request. Then she takes the bag into the kitchen and returns it moments later without a word.\n\nI check the sauce levels; there is one dab, the size of a damn nickle. Are you kidding me? I didn't bother to ask for more. My companions were itching to leave, and I had some mustard and mayo packets back at my room. \n\nThe burger tasted as tragic as it looked, too. The patty was dense as clay with very little flavor, and there weren't enough pickles or lettuce to jazz up the texture. The whole thing was very meh and it kind of bummed me out.\n\nOn a side note, the bathrooms at Faubourg were reprehensibly filthy, and the doors didn't lock properly.",

We ordered alligator bisque and two other appetizers for the table. We all got our soup, then here came salads for those who ordered them. Kept thinking the other appetizers were just a little slow coming out. Nope. They never came out, but certainly were on the check!  The entrees were good, but nowhere near how they should've been for the price. Get that.....good, not terrific, fabulous or wonderful. Just good. We've since been to two other iconic NOLA restaurants that ran circles around Antoine's! It's fun to say you've been where a famous dish was developed, so my suggestion is to go for appetizers and drinks. Dinner and service were both disappointments.",

The menu is very large right behind the counter and relatively easy to read. Tons of vegan and vegetarian options! I ordered the breakfast burrito with vegan cheese instead of regular and a large coffee. If you bring in your own cup they take 50 cents off. I got the French roast, which is actually really really good... Very robust. They have some really good soy milk out on the self-serve counter... I'm actually pretty picky about soy milk and get really particular about how my coffee is made. I am coming back here a million times. The bathroom was very clean, which makes one feel pretty good about the cleanliness of the kitchen. Also saw a bunch of pretty inspirational things written on the bathroom walls... There's plenty of outlets available in the cafe to plug in for a while and several places to sit. By the way, the burrito was very well made - not soggy, everything was mixed together well, and she grilled it so that it stuck together. Sliced it into perfect halves.

The decor was fun, eclectic, and felt very cozy. The wine list was well curated. One of the owners, Alejandra, helped guide me through the wine list expertly. She and the chef who own the place were so friendly and knowledgeable. The food was absolutely sublime - we had the steak tartare, crostinis, and the octopus (which was the best I've ever had!) Will definitely come back to this hidden gem next time I'm in SB.",

We were approached by a staff member who asked if we were looking to be seated. Not sure why else we would be standing in the doorway but um yes please.

Oh well too bad someone from this establishment told you 15 minutes ago there was a short wait, but we aren't seating anyone without a reservation.

It is smaller but that's what I love about it! I have been there when they first open all the way through the end of the night and I have never felt like it was busy which is of course a huge plus. \nThe childcare center is phenomenal! My baby boy is just shy of two years old and he loves everyone who works there! They're all so loving and patient and they will do everything they can before they have to come pull you out of your exercise. Some days I don't have him with me and they ask me how he is and why he isn't there. That shows me they take the time to get to know your child and really do care.\nThe trainers are absolutely top notch! My personal favorites are Laura, Angie and Jamie! They're energy level is unmatched! They kick your butt and make you work hard without belittling you. They make you want to give your all and push yourself which is what I need! I joined Angie's boot camp class and it has completely changed my life and way of thinking! The way she has developed a sense of community is just amazing! I wouldn't dare go  anywhere else! \nThe staff that checks you in and that you see throughout the gym is very kind and helpful. \nOverall, I love this gym and the people that is apart of it!",

  "text": "Timing is everything.  The place looks like a ton of fun if you come when the fun people are there as well.  We visited from 30 miles away on a cold, snowy Saturday for lunch.  My wife and I were first timers while we accompanied friends who had come before a few times.  \n\nFirst off, the beer is top notch!  Indiana Amber, Gnaw Bone Pale and the Snake Pit Porter are just fantastic brews.  Nice work, OB brew crew.  (I was a little surprised that I wasn't offered any to purchase and carry out but maybe they just don't have the process or place to do that.)  \n\nOverall, the food was good.  My grilled tuna sandwich & fries was terrific (nice horsey sauce) and my wife's tenderloin met up to Indiana's tough standards regarding such.  The \"Cowboy Caviar\" was an excellent appetizer, but the name doesn't really do it justice.  If it works for OB, then it works for me too, I guess.  One of my table mates wasn't a fan of the roasted red pepper on her Reuben but her husband was good with it.   The bread pudding for dessert seemed to be a table hit.\n\nWhile the service and the beer were both excellent, and the food was pretty good, the ambiance / atmosphere of the place didn't quite win me over.  Sitting over on the family side (to the left once you enter), I felt a little bit like I was in a cramped Ponderosa Steakhouse.  Next time I'm going to push to sit in the \"Brewhouse\" which looks much cooler.\n\nIn a city with TONS of other excellent choices, Oaken Barrel is worth a stop or adding to your rotation.",

  "text": "Short story: good burger, not amazing but good, and over priced. They offer vegetarian options as well which is nice. \n\nLong story: my husband loves this place so he took me here to try it. I was not blown away by it as he was. He ordered the CEO burger and I ordered the single CEO (same burger with one patty instead of two). The burger itself was good. It wasn't juicy but cooked well done, which I actually like in my burgers, no pink for me! It was good quality meat. It comes on a potato bun, which since I only ordered a single seemed like too much bun to meat ratio, they were fat buns but if you squish it down its not so bad. The condiments it comes with was slim so it was dry. If you cook a burger well done you have to have sauce on it. I added grilled mushrooms to mine ($1 upcharge). Those were good. \n\nI got a side of the special garlic fries they offer which were good but the garlic aioli is only drizzled on top so most of the fries underneath don't have the sauce, and don't try to ask for extra sauce it's $1 for a side of it. We ordered 2 burgers, 1 drink and 1 side of fries and it was $27!! Sorry too expensive for what it is. \n\nI appreciate that they do offer veggie burgers as well. I'm not a vegetarian but have many friends that are so that's kinda nice for a burger place. \n\nThe inside is cute but freezing cold! They also have an outside patio which we sat at because, did I mention it was like Antarctica inside?? The outside patio was nice as well. Honestly it wasn't bad food but I probably won't be back. Too pricey when there's so much good competition.",

I must insert here now that my husband is 69 and I am 61.  But I'd like to think that we are youthful and delight in new things.  This place is young and hip and we did feel a little out of place.  It's family seating with a modern flare.  We were undoubtedly the oldest is the place.  Now I must tell you that everyone treated us wonderfully.  And the fried chicken was fabulous.  We loved it with the spicy honey.  The mac and cheese and mashed potatoes and biscuits were superb.  I hate it when I order wine and get just a couple of sips.

I prepaid for my rental which the funds were taken out and when I got there to pick up the car the agent asked me for the credit card I used which has happened at other rental places so I thought nothing of it. She then proceeded to try and run the card again but my credit card company immediately Flagged it because I had just prepaid for the rental hours before. I told her that I got a text when she ran it that it was declined because it was ran twice for the same amount.I asked if they could just adjust the prepaid amount since it was already done and she stated that I would have to call the credit card company and see when it would be removed. I asked what was the point of prepaying especially when they already had the funds. I asked was I paying some additional charges and she stated no I was just paying for the rental. I was confused because she could clearly see I had already paid.I then asked if I could use another card as if I stepped out of line I would have to to wait again behind about 20 people and I had to be at work. I would call the credit card company later and remove the charge. I had my debit card and I asked could I use that and she stated yes but they needed to see my ticket for my flight out of the airport. I stepped to the side so I could pull it up and then was helped by another lady who never asked for it. The new lady then went on to tell me my total was over 700.00. I asked so it went from 132.00 to 700.00. Then she stated oh no it's 340.00. I asked is it because I am using a debit card are the charging me a hold. The lady stated yes and I would get it back. So I agreed so I could get the car and get to work. I start driving and get a text message that 565.00 was debited from my account. I get immediately turn around and go back and the was told by another worker in the service area where you pull up she only saw my prepaid amount and no other payment on the account. She asked why would another payment method be required when the total was already prepaid. She turned around the screen and showed me the prepaid amount. I proceeded to go back to the counter and speak with manager and the two ladies who helped me. I told them I was returning the car and I wanted to know where the charge for the 565.00 was at because I was only told that the prepaid amount was showing. They all looked clueless. I pulled up my bank statement and showed them and the manager did something in the computer and said oh I see it. I proceeded to ask why I was made to pay that if it was already prepaid. She stated no there was no prepayment I used my debit card. I laughed and showed her the receipt I was given when I pulled back in that only showed the prepaid amount. She then proceeded to tell me that the funds will be released in 24 to 48 hours from my bank. I told her that's not answering my question but thanks and that 90.00 would be deducted for the two hours I had the car. I left even more confused.",

  "text": "My girlfriend had this local in her list of places to try in the city so on the night of the 8th of December we visited. The place is rather small. I counted about 4 tables so sitting can be a problem. Luckily, when we got in, we found an empty table and we took it. After that we ordered an \"affogato flight\" which consists of 4 affogati and it costs $25 (it seems to be a special concoction). The ladies that were serving customers were nice and polite. One of them worked hard on our order which took about 5 minutes to prepare. He co-worker eventually brought it to our table. My girlfriend took the Cookie Monster (Mexican hot chocolate) and Vietnamese coffee (stracciatella). I took the Matcha Matcha (green tea) and the Classico (Tahitian vanilla). From what I tasted, I really liked both affogati and, as a fan of the affogato in general, they were somewhat pricey but probably worth the money. What wasn't worth was to listen to 3 adult jerks and 2 young kids trashing the place with loud behavior and their raging complete disrespect for the rest of the people around them. As I was trying to enjoy my affogati I was really trying to hold myself from punching the assholes that were sitting next to us (2 women and 1 man who were raised like savages and their kids are nothing different). The only reason I did not get into a fight is because I did not want my girlfriend to see me get into a fight.\nNotice: the plural of affogato is affogati and not affogatos!",

I actually had to go to the office to find out what was going on and they offered no apologies or reason for ignoring me and not showing up like I paid them to do.  BASICALLY THEY STOLE FROM ME!! Took my money and lied to me.  The one time they did come they guy left my house a mess and did not live up to what he had told me he was going to do.  Absolutely disappointed with this company.

I'd recommend putting in meat or peanut things called out in the menu for those of us who have allergies bad enough that we carry around $800 EpiPens (not to add to or immense street cred already). I'd also love a few more vegetarian options. The avacado tacos are baller but I'd love a few more things like Seitan bun or something to have alternative entree options. \n\nJust some things to think about.

None of us wanted desserts, we just wanted our entrees. When my entree came out, gnocchi in cheese sauce, it looked like white on white glop with no color or garnish.

  "text": "My boyfriend and I went out here for a date night recently and had a great experience! First, we were pleasantly surprised that Blue Monkey has a HUGE selection of beers. After ordering 2 Kolsches, we ordered the stuffed roasted red pepper and onion rings for appetizers. The stuffed roasted red pepper was a bit expensive for how small it was, but delicious nonetheless. The onion rings were also delicious - I really liked them with the sweet chili sauce.\nFor dinner, I got the Chicken Barcelona, which was chicken stuffed with sausage in a creamy tomato sauce. The sauce, combined with the sides of green beans and bulgar gave the dish a distinctly Mediterranean taste, which was unexpected but delicious. My boyfriend got the Chicken Bella Buca, which had chicken stuffed with prosciutto, served with spinach (my boyfriend was disappointed that it didn't come with a carb like rice or a potato-I personally think it would've paired nicely with mashed potatoes). The balsamic glaze on it was delicious, albeit a bit sweet.\nOverall, the food was delicious, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I'd definitely return here, especially to try out their pork belly or duck sandwiches which seemed unique!",

  "text": "KenScale: 9.0/10\n\nFor the second time in a row, my best meal in New Orleans turned out to be a sandwich shop. Coming to the Big Easy with my wife Jun, I didn't think I would have an experience as memorable as I've had at Cochon Butcher which I had visited a couple of years ago. Even when Turkey and the Wolf was declared the #1 best new restaurant in America by the highly respected Bon Appetit magazine, I was still somewhat skeptical (Cochon Butcher was that good!). After our lunch, however, I'm comfortable declaring that Turkey and the Wolf is one of the best restaurants in New Orleans, period. The ingenuity behind the art of sandwich-making was just so astounding that Jun and I were not sure if we can ever turn back to normal sandwiches again.\n\nThe concise menu at Turkey and the Wolf doesn't look like much, but each sandwich that we ordered really stood out on its own. Take the fried bologna, a humongous sandwich that came with mustard, potato chips (whole ones, not crushed in bits and pieces), shredded lettuce (\"shrettuce\" in their parlance), mayo and American cheese. All of these seemingly random ingredients combined to create bites that are so unique and powerful (but not overwhelmingly heavy or salty) in flavor, a sensation that neither Jun nor I have quite experienced previously when eating sandwiches. I would have been so preoccupied wolfing down this masterpiece the entire time we sat down at the table if not for the other sandwich we ordered. The collar green melt was truly a thing of beauty. How could a simple combination of slow cooked collards with Swiss cheese, pickled cherry, pepper dressing and cole slaw be as impressive as the decadent fried bologna, especially if there is no meat? Our initial doubts were quickly gone once we started biting into the sandwich. I don't know what kind of mad science goes into this one, but it sure was sensational! I didn't expect to be so dazzled by a vegetarian sandwich that displayed a complexity of flavor and texture that was thoughtful and pure genius.   \n\nTurkey and Wolf doesn't take reservations and the place packs up pretty quickly during lunchtime but the turnover rate is also fast so you wouldn't have to wait too long before securing a table (you make orders at the counter and a server brings to food for you). I do encourage anyone coming to the sandwich shop to try one or two cocktails with playful names such as \"They Grow Up Slow Fast\" (a bourbon based cocktail that I liked very much) or \"The Fish That Ate the Whale\". I feel sheer joy during my culinary journey with Jun when we discover a place with unassuming, simple philosophy that turns out to hand out some amazing foods. Turkey and the Wolf, not quite hidden after all the accolades, may look like a modest neighborhood sandwich joint but I won't forget their sandwiches in a long, long time.",

  "text": "At a wedding in Idaho and needed some late night snacks. These guys were open until 3am which really helped. When I called, the guy I was talking to was incredible nice and genuine. I don't know about you guys, but typically when I call and order a pizza, the person on the other end could care less about providing good service and typically sound rushed and even bothered when helping. But this guy, (maybe Nick or Nathan? Not 100% sure) was so kind and I want to hire him back in Cali because he really was that awesome. Not to mention, it was 12:30am and he still slayed. Another big plus, they came all the way up to my door and didn't make me meet them in the lobby which other places usually do. So huge win on the service piece, guys! Keep it up! \nThe food was decent. Not the best pizza I've ever had, but definitely not the worst either. We got the potato bacon just to try something different. I probably wouldn't get it again. It wasn't terrible, just not my fav. I did absolutely love the canned Root beer they had tho! Some folks in Idaho make it and it is one of the best I've had.",

  "text": "Found DT after looking online for a bit and based my decision on reviews.  I didn't know exactly what I wanted (percentage or film type) but Dan helped in the decision process with his cool bench setup and I went with a 35% nano-ceramic.  This was 7 months ago and I (deliberately) waited to post this review to see how things would hold up.\n\nI am pleased to report the quality is outstanding.  There are no bubbles or noticable deformations.  There is something extremely minor on the driver side rear window but it only bothers me when my OCD is flaring up and only I (or Dan maybe) would notice it.\n\nInstall was done within the timeframe specified and I had a nice walk on the Monon.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have gone with 20% tint.  35% looks good but it could be darker.\n\nSo why 4 stars?  Well honestly, the cleanup afterwards.  I don't know the precise chemicals used but there were serious amounts of haze and residue that I had to get rid of for a few weeks.  Main carp is there was another car after mine and I don't know if it was a scheduling thing but cleanup felt rushed at the end.  Dan offered to clean up but I really needed to get going.  After 7 months this still just stuck with me...for what I spent it just feels the should be adequate time built in to finish.\n\nThat said, zero complaints on the install quality...and ultimately that is what matters.  Nice work Dan.",

  "text": "I just love how their chicken is so high quality, flavourful, crispy and reasonably priced!! I'm in love with this place!!! I got the garlic soy chicken in the 5 piece set with house fries and pesto macaroni. The fries were decent, a little too thick for my liking. The pesto macaroni is tasty! The star of the show was definitely the chicken, cooked to perfection. It smelt great and made everyone in the car super hungry lol. However, the sauce is a little bit sweet, so if you don't like sweeter sauces you might prefer the OG chicken which I'll probably get next time. If you order the chicken online to pick up at the store, you won't have to wait once you get there! Overall, super delicious chicken, and it's a great deal too. For $11.55 you can get the 5 piece set, which is an extremely satisfying and filling meal!",

It was comforting to feel safe when eating out. \n\nThe best brownie bites (misnomer) taste like chocolate coconut macaroons- delicious. The burritos are so filling and hearty. I loved the sunflower seed sour cream. The cashew/coconut cream was nice, just wish there was more. I wasn't a big fan of the \"jerk\" dressing on the salad- very sour and not well balanced.

The salad bar was very nice and you could go in and just get the salad bar without the meats and still be satisfied; there was much more than salad presented and their version of eggplant parmesan was outstanding The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars was the service. The servers were hovering about our table the entire meal. They were a little too attentive. They engaged us in WAY too much conversation. I love attentive servers, but this was to the point of overbearing. At one point, one of the servers reached across and over my brother's plate of food in front of his face to pick up the wine carafe to pour more wine (which neither of us wanted). I definitely recommend giving this place a try. Just be prepared to ask the servers to back off a little.",

She was so happy! She couldn't stop talking about it! The children laughed so hard during the performance and my 30 year old brother laughed even harder! The act was professional, appropriate and extremely entertaining for both children and adults. It didn't drag out at all and everyone couldn't believe how fast that hour went by! The balloons were also a big hit! Matt is great and I already have so many guests asking about him, I'm sure he will get lots of bookings!",

Easily the best I've ever had. A friend ordered the Flat Daniel and said it was really good too. We also got an order of fries. That turned out to be on parchment paper and was the size of the table!  There's no way we could finish them but they were good. \nOur waitress was awesome. She was friendly, funny and helpful.",

  "text": "Chic Asian spot off central. Low lit dinner seating with open style kitchen and brighter bar area with Sunday night football. Outside seating was available but current temp ironically enough is Floridian icicle. Baos pork belly buns were bomb.com! Pork is a tad on the salty side but the buns had a sweet kick that paired perfect. Golden wantons were a good app as well but if you were gonna get one or the other, go with Baos buns. For the main event, miso ramen. If you're into ramen, this one is excellent. Broth = delicious and braised pork belly = super flavorful. Splurged for dessert deciding to go with the Royal Pairing - creme brûlée with mangosteen compote. Very small serving size and not typical of the traditional brûlée dish, yet unique in the best way. Bartender was cool and told my buddy he could have the imperial stout beer he was interested in on the house if he didn't like it - so nice of her to offer! I'll definitely be returning to try a few more menu items next time I'm in the Burg:)",

So order on the App and get in and out!\n\nYes you might be out of beans and rice if you come close to closing times! So again order online or using the App to get what you want. \nFor example at this visit I had a sofridas bowl, I was not expecting a perfect bowl because it was during the rush. \n\nHowever it was pretty close to the standards, and I skipped the huge line by ordering through the app. \n\nAnyways fast food is not far to come once and give a poor rating, the employees are always rotating...",

When we walked in to wait to be seated we noticed every open table was full of dirty dishes and the staff was making no effort to clean any of them. Several servers walked passed us without even acknowledging our presence. When we were finally approached we were told to wait again because they had to clean a table. Not ideal but ok. When we finally were sat the table had not been cleaned properly and still had food particles on the table. The floor was sticky and and nasty throughout the whole restaurant. We sat at our table for approximately 10 minutes without any interaction from staff members. While we sat there the staff continued to walk by us and finally one said that somebody would be with us but she continued to walk past us. She never stopped to take our drink order or see if we needed anything. As a general rule my family and I try to remain patient and understanding in restaurants. However, when the place is filthy from the floor to the tables and they employ staff who could care less then our patience runs out. We will go somewhere else to spend our money. I would not reccomed this location to anyone. You will have better luck going to McDonald's than you would at this Steak N Shake.",

I made sure I bought them within 10 days of Christmas so I could return them.  My daughter didn't like the color so we brought them back to see if they had anything else.  They didn't have the size she needed or color she wanted and wouldn't be getting anymore for several months.  It was at this point that they told me we can only do store credit.  They did offer to try and find me a pair but were unable to do so unless I wanted to wait for another two months.  At this point they have my merchandise and my money.  The store is disgustingly over priced and there is nothing in there I would purchase.  I went there specifically for Birkenstocks, not $800 sunglasses.  The Operations Manager did nothing to help me other than saying \"Sorry\".  If you can't provide the item I want to purchase then refund my money so I can purchase it somewhere else.

If that's your jam then hit up Genos or Pats alongside the tourists and those rare, truly die hard locals that actually think those places are delicious (my girlfriend included). For less than 9 bucks you get a cheese steak with your choice of cheese and a side of fries. I always get the mayo added with their fried onions. Soooooo good. If possible, pick it up and eat it ASAP but to be honest their delivery has become increasingly efficient. Their pizza is average but good and cheap. Pro tip: during the week they have great specials. Download their menu from their website and take advantage of major meals",

(Not all of them though, so make sure you aren't planning on seeing specific animals.) The little village set up right at the entrance has a variety of activities - visit with Santa, see a reindeer (who unfortunately wasn't there when we went), and even a mirror maze. We were already fans of the zoo, but this is a great new holiday tradition that we'll definitely continue in future years.",

  "text": "I really wanted to like the bar at the Ace Hotel. I drove into town and started my night there because I'd heard good things. But from start to finish the customer service was abysmal. I arrived ten minutes before happy hour ended but as I'm standing in the main bar area reading the menu, the hostess grabbed it out of my hand saying \"happy hour's over.\" Rude, but I was going to give her a pass. Walked up to the bar and got the same answer from the bartender, even after showing him on my phone that there was still two minutes left. To make things worse, while getting the drinks ready, he knocked over my can of beer and spilled half of it on me. At this point, most bartenders would get me a fresh one on the house. Not this guy. He still charged me the full price and drank the other half of the spilled one, himself.\n\nThe only saving grace for this bar was that the poutine was actually pretty legit. Basically a full meal. If you do go, I recommend that. Shame it's the last time I'll ever have it. There are way too many other good bars I can go to to have overpriced beer spilled on me.",

  "text": "When I go to Angry Chair, I usually leave angry. \n\nI've been to this bar several times because it's within walking distance of my mom's house and biking distance from my house. I like drinking close to home, who wouldn't? What drew me to this bar was it's reputation and the electric group of beers available for drinking. Each time I've gone to this bar, I leave a little bit more angry than the time before. Here's why:\n\n1. The parking is absolutely terrible and the people who live on the street post signs for you not to park on the street. Unless you can walk or bike, forget it. \n\n2. The service is rude, rude, rude. Each time I've gone, I feel like I'm inconveniencing the bartender. Once, I had trouble seeing the sign of beers and asked for a menu. The bartender told me they no longer print menus and that I needed to get up and read the sign at the other end of the bar if I wanted to know what was being served that day. \n\n3. This bar used to have interesting options like milk stouts and sours, making it different from every other brewery in Seminole Heights. Lately, they've been brewing what every other bar brews--IPAs. From a brewing perspective, I get why it's done, but now the bar has lost its originality. \n\nThe design of the building is neat and the decor makes it one of a kind, but for me, I can't move beyond the bad experiences I've had the last few times I've gone there. I probably won't return back to this bar.",

This was our second time here and we got to the restaurant half an hour before our reservation but were seated immediately. Bar has a good selection of cocktails. They serve sushi and Hibachi style dinner. Ordered chicken and salmon dinner which came as 6-7 course meal and ofcourse the main items cooked infront of us. After dinner, our clothes smelled like we had been working in a kitchen that night but it was a lot of fun. Chef Bryan and server Karli ensured food, appetizers, drinks and service are on point. Chef entertained the table by squirting sake in to guests mouth which turned out to be hilarious because the bottle got empty by the time it was my turn :). He also surprised us with squirt ketchup bottle prank. Manager Sophie was engaged with the guests and checking on tables. We received free sakes with Yelp checkin which was nice. \nIchiban has become a must stop for us during our trips to Reno/Tahoe and i highly recommend this place.",

My wife was the one who told me about these guys and they have been taking care of her vehicles for a long time now. I am definitely a fan now. The service is good and they get it done. As with any place is Reno good mechanics are hard to find and once you can trust even more difficult. I am trusting these guys more and more. With that said they are pricey but I think anywhere you go there is a price to pay. But I think they are priced competitively to other mechanic shops around town. I just started trusting these guys more than the alternative. I have been to other mechanics who have pull a fast one on me and I would never wish that on anyone else. Because it cost a lot of time, money and just plain sucked if you have to pay for work on your vehicle just to have it break down on you. \n\nI will say they do get very busy so wait times can be a bit long but I feel they are worth the wait because I trust them now. Just keep that in mind. I usually leave my vehicle here for a while but I do have another vehicle to use in the mean time so that's not an issue for me. But it might be an issue for you. \n\nI have been coming here to a couple of years now and like I said the more I take my vehicle here the more I trust them. I hope this helps you decide on you next mechanic shop. Thanks for reading my review.",

We ordered the potatoes with cashew cheese and vegan sour cream to start and it was amazing. Then we order roasted vegetable Alfredo and Brussels and mushroom sandwich. Both super yummy. My sandwich was so incredible I ate the whole thing, Brussels sprouts were roasted and they had an aoli that was to die for on a baguette. Also got side salad with vegan ranch and it was so amazing. Fresh dill in the ranch was top notch in flavor. The vegetables in the Alfredo were so delicious as well. Everything fresh of course but I thought it needed a little salt but the flavor was fantastic. All the food was beautifully prepared and so fresh, tasted like it was just picked out of a garden!

The atmosphere was welcoming and intimate, even though the tables were set in an arrangement with neighbors nearby.  The cheese opener was well paired, but even more so was the variety of crisps, beads, nuts and spreads that accompanied it.  My guest had the plate of root vegetables which was as beautiful as it was delicious.  The fish en papillote was yellow snapper- moist, flaky, and so good as to make me ignore the rest of the plate.  My slippery slope cocktail was the first of two- I nearly ordered a third (hence the name?).  I was disappointed not to find the same desserts on the menu as I'd seen online (needs updating) because I had my heart set on pineapple right-side up cake but was delighted by the apple crisp with quinoa and caramel that we shared.  Service was polite, efficient, but when we overheard the server at another table offering explanations of the menu selections we got server envy.  We might have ordered another course or two with such enticement.  All said we are likely to return, being a superior dining experience.",

I love how it's landscaped and decorated, especially the central area.  It's very welcoming and it's being maintained very well.  There are plenty of places to sit down and rest if needed, which is probably nice in the hot summer months.\n\nThe mall has some good stores and some duds.  You can find some pretty nice deals, some easily and some take some more patience, but they exist.  Some stores have no deals at all and aren't really worth the time.  \n\nI like the selection of the major sports apparel brand stores especially.  It's nice to find a good deal on everyday clothing and work out gear.\n\nThey also have an app that has deals in it sometimes.  I scored a $20 gift card to Michael Kors from it (no strings attached).  I ended up with a nice wallet for about $10 after the in-store promo and the gift card.

We considered it better than any similar restaurants we have been to in New York or Italy.\nThe location is just off of Broad in South Philly and parking was no problem on the street .\nIt is small, and once one passes the front kitchen/pizza section, two charming little rooms contain small tables set up cosily.It feels one is in a small neighborhood restaurant in Italy.\nThe waiters were very attentive and without asking they divided my girlfriend's and my dishes on separate plates after overhearing that we were talking about trying each other's dishes. We were very impressed by this!\nThe food was simply the best we have ever had; the grilled calamari and the shrimp appetizer were out of this world. The gnocci with mushrooms and the duck were also exeptional. The desserts were also fantastic.

  "text": "I am a frequent customer at Benihana, I've eaten at locations in Maryland, Miami, San Diego, and Nevada. However, this was my first and last time visiting the Cherry hill location in New Jersey. My family and I made a reservation for nine at 7:45pm. We arrived at 7:40pm and were not seated until 8:50pm, absolutely ridiculous. If there was still going to be an hour wait after our reservation time the hostess should've informed us of that when we called to reserve our table or when we checked in for our reservation. Instead, she just kept telling us \"only a few more minutes.\" After being seated, our server did not come over to take our drink order for an additional 15 minutes. By the time she came over we were all ready to order food. I asked the server if we could order our food with our drinks and she responded \"no\" (Which I know is not true). She then took an additional 20 minutes to return with our drinks and STILL did not take our order until returning to our table for the third time. At this point, it is about 9:40pm and we still have not ordered our food, despite having a 7:45pm reservation. The waitress finally returns to take our order and the chef began cooking around 10:00. The chef on the other hand was great! However, my family and I did not leave the restaurant until 11pm. This dinner turned into a three hour trip when it is usually about an hour to an hour and a half. Needless to say, this was my worst Benihana experience thus far.",

Absolutely! \n\nThere is Aaaaaaa Lottttt of selections to chose from and very diverse there is definitely something for everyone's taste buds.  \n\nMy favorites - the shrimps and salmon. \n\nMy least favorites - the cream of carrot soup and pumpkin pie. Both very bland and tasteless. \n\nDrink- Arnold Palmer and it was perfectly made and mixed. \n\nLine was quick, staff was very nice and helpful. Would I do it again YES !",

The food was amazingly good and the thing I loved most about it was that they had a range of spiciness for you to choose from (I'm a sucker for spicy food so this was just amazing!). You can choose from a level of 1-10 for how spicy you want your meal to be. I chose a 8 and it was little hard to get down (so just make sure you don't get anything to spicy that you can't even eat it)\nOur waiter was very helpful in informing us on the dishes and making us make our decisions!(super hard cause I'm so decisive oops), So I'm very thankful!",

  "text": "Grabbed a classic, no frills, yummy pizza from here! Found ourselves walking around Yardley looking for a warm place to hide out from the cold with enough space to seat 5. A local suggested Verrelli's to us (in her words, the better pizza in town), so off we went. \n\nVerrelli's is located in a cute little strip mall in the back of a large private parking lot. Parking was ample and free around noon on a Wednesday, which was an added bonus!! \n\nThe inside is small, but they pack a lot of tables in! There is a large counter where you can order slices or other food to go, or you can choose a table or booth and stay in. \n\nOnly tried the pizza on this trip. The crust was delicious- the perfect blend of crunchy and soft. The sauce was good, but not great. Just a really solid piece of pizza!! Large pizza was huge (as expected) and inexpensive- $12.25 for a large cheese. Took maybe 15 minutes for it to come out after we ordered. \n\nDefinitely a very positive experience here, and I would recommend this to anyone looking to grab a yummy slice!",

  "text": "Extremely unprofessional, unethical company...avoid them at all cost!  The owner of Portofino and his sale associate are as dishonest as they come.  They told us to CHILL when we confronted them after weeks of nonstop stories and lies.  Cindy L's review from Yelp is correct...this company is struggling, a dying business. There's virtually no traffic each time I was at their showroom. A contractor in SB described the owner as sick, twisted, crazy and shameless; the owner's former employee will not stop telling everyone to avoid Portofino windows & doors at all cost. \n\nPortofino will not deliver, install and guarantee doors they measured and ordered as agreed in their contract instead they demanded all the money without installation/guarantee/warranty by the manufacturer once they received 50% of your downpayment. They will confront their customers by asking \"Where on your invoices does it state installation?\" Their invoices doesn't state installation/finishes etc., because they will tell their customers all their door prices include installation/delivery/finishes/hardware etc.  \n\nBefore they deposit your 50% downpayment , they will tell you....\"We're a ONE-STOP-SHOP, NO NEED TO FIND A PAINTER/STAINER AS WE'RE KNOWN FOR OUR FINISHES. NO NEED FOR A CONTRACTOR TO INSTALL YOUR DOORS AS THE OWNER IS A CONTRACTOR\"...THIS IS A COMPLETE LIE!!!  Employees are trained to be dishonest when it's time for them to install the doors. They will tell you they forgot to add the cost of finishes so you actually owe them more and that install isn't part of the cost. I've text messages and emails from and to the owner & his salesman that refute their claims. \n\nI contact Renewal by Anderson Windows & Doors, setup a free in home estimate. Anderson offer 12 months interest free for all purchases and their product have a 25 years warranty. Their grand total included... install, delivery, tax, factory finishes, professional finishes, trimmings, permit by the county as it's required by the building and safety department, dumping fee, stucco patching, hardware, satisfaction guarantee, etc etc. https://www.renewalbyandersen.com \n\nAnderson Windows and Doors was so professional, my project was smooth sailing. My doors is so amazing and the people were professional...Top notch, exactly like Neiman Marcus & Horchow. No matter what, ALWAYS GO WITH THE BIG BRAND NAME RATHER THEN A SMALL BUSINESS SUCH AS PORTOFINO WHEN INVESTING IN SUCH A BIG TICKET ITEM.  Portofino have nothing to loose and everything to gain. I had to reach out to the CSLB and they told me to call his Bond. In doing so, the owner of Portofino offered to give me back my 50% downpayment. Do you think Horchow, Anderson Windows & Doors, Sears will behave like this? \n\nPortofino offer me nothing but a WOW website, at the end my journey with Portofino resulted in legal fees, anger and a waste of my valuable time. Anderson Windows & Doors have been in business since 1903, a truly magnificent company vs. Portofino, a very poor mindset, unethical company where the owner is unable to foreseen the future for his business and his employees. A truly dead end company!",

  "text": "For my sister in laws 31st birthday last night she wanted to do karaoke extremely badly. We have never been but a quick search found The Point just down the street from where we were at. We didn't know what to expect. First off it's a tiny place, kind of hard to park unless you know where you are going. Yes they have bars on the windows but who cares cause it's a bar/karaoke place. The bartender was one of the hardest working bartenders I've ever seen. Constantly moving but she even had time to sing a song. They do not skimp on the alcohol too. The mixed drinks my wife and sister in law had were extremely strong. Prices were on par with most places. We had 8 rounds of drinks (including 2 rounds of shots) between 4 people and spent $100 including tips. The beer list was what you would expect from a karaoke place, lot of popular domestic beers (Miller, Coors, Blue Moon) and popular imported (Corona, Modelo, Stella). Stuck with Stella the whole night which was fine. The interior was nice and clean, but again since it's a small place it got crowded very quickly and everyone was trying to get a drink. The restrooms were kind of weird because they didn't have doors on them so you could hear people peeing (again not a big deal). \n\nNow the only reason I gave them 3 stars is because of the complete disdain and quite hostility we received from the regular clientele. Now I get that a business can not control there clientele but the constant stares and judgmental whispers honestly killed the whole experience. Yes my sister in law was dressed in a pretty revealing attire but wore a full length coat over it. She still get disapproving glares and whispers by some of the women there even thought we attempted to be extremely friendly and polite. Unfortunately we all received a lot of glares and whispers regardless of how we acted. It got to the point that I stopped saying excuse me or sorry because the regulars were just rude. We just stuck to our little corner and tried to have a good time and ignore the constant quite hostility. \n\nSo even though the establishment was kind of fun, the mood that the regulars give off to anyone new completely kills the vibe and makes it extremely uncomfortable. Unfortunately I do not think I will ever return which really is a shame.",

  "text": "This place is a classic family favorite serving a bit of Italian and a bit of Greek. I find the cozy atmosphere to be a bit more updated, brighter and less stuffy than other places on The Hill. They have bar, booth, table and patio seating, so take your pick. They have a full service bar that serves the full lunch/dinner menu. The service here is good and it's a safe bet that you'll leave satisfied.  \n\nMust try's: toasted ravioli, pizza and salads. T-ravs are some of the best I've had. Love the pizza--plenty to share and you can get different toppings on each 1/2. Don't forget to get a house salad with your pizza-yum. \n\nA couple of the pastas I've tried were a bit on the salty side. I would shy away from the pastas if you are sensitive to salt or consult with the wait staff about it before ordering. \n\nI've only dined on the Italian side of Anthonino's and can't wait to go back and try some of their Greek menu items.",

  "text": "I used to be a big fan of Ossip when I started seeing them in 2013/14. They were always good with customer service and I really liked my doctor, but this last year something has really changed on the customer service front. I went in for my annual eye exam and they were just having an off day, no big deal, I figured it was a one-off type of thing. They recommended contacts so I agreed to try them out provided my insurance plan would cover them, so they said they would check and the \"trial\" was all covered by my plan. Later on I receive a bill for 96.00 for a contact lens fitting that my plan apparently does NOT cover. I specifically made sure to verify with the staff that this service was covered before making the appointment in the first place. Thinking this was a misunderstanding I called into the office and spoke with the front desk and nothing was settled. They then had someone named Johnny contact me from their insurance office; they informed me what my plan covered. My issue is of course that I was told by the office the benefit was covered. She said she couldn't do anything to help me but she'd reach out to the regional manager. Really I was just looking for an apology given the fact their office staff incorrectly interpreted my plan. Partially my fault as I should have double checked and been aware. So in the end I get a call from a woman, Not sure her title, but I think she said she was the regional manager. Does this company not know how to resolve issues during the primary complaint, are they seriously this inept that I had to have three conversations and speak to a regional manager? This woman leaves me a message, not even with her personal contact information, but two separate locations that she'll be at that week that I can call and ask to speak with her. At this point I gave up- its was obvious they weren't going to be of assistance, and had no understanding what my complaint was despite my four plus years as a customer. \n\nAfter this experience I don't trust doing business with them anymore. They are sneaky with offering clinical and retail services because its quite obvious they do not care about customer relationships, just their profits.",

You will wait in the drive thru line for 30 minutes for milkshakes that are made right when you order them so they are flavored milk by the time you get to pay for them. When you complain that they are melted they try to bs you and say it is from the whipped cream. My advice, drive further down the road and bypass this location. The absolute worst customer service skills. The idiot in drive thru charged us for someone else's order tried to tell me I was wrong. Then the manager comes to help her and not one apology from him. That place is a joke. The owner should fire everyone there and start over and hire people with at least a high school diploma.",

Displeased with CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION . with a group of 3 women being waited on by the two men servers. I was up next to waited on after standing in line approximately 10 to 15 while the women were being serviced. When my turn came I asked the guy behind the register what flavors were available and he said the list is located over there. I was in a wheelchair. I asked to sample the flavor that appeared to be sugar cookie and was totally ignored. The guy was rude and uninterested in serving a handicapped individual. I will never patronize this business. The guy seemed more interested in standing around then making money.",

I held all the money in my hand along with the items and didn't lay it out. There was only one other person in the store and I know this as the only vehicle in the parking lot was the one I came in. \n\nI said he should pull the video so that he can just see and this would clear it up. He then started to raise his voice and told me he only works here and he isn't the owner. Naturally I started to raise my voice also.

He then followed me into the parking lot and told me I better not come back at 9 and that I would not step into the store.

So as a patron I would have followed 'procedure' if I knew I had to save the burnt pizza. I'm sure they use for the burnt pizza. I was excited to get it as I'd heard good things and where I'm stationed in the military there's no Imo's. Horrible. Just wanted to let everyone know about the 'swap it out' clause at Imo's.",

Thank you Jockamos!\n\nDo not order delivery from this Jockamos. I ordered two spinach salads with extra dressing and breadsticks. They arrived with NO salad dressing or sauce for the breadsticks. I called to ask them to please send the dressing and they refused. The woman said that she could ask the driver if he wanted to come back out but he was out on a run and she didn't think he'd \"want\" to. She then offered if I would like to speak to a manager also stating that I'd be told the same thing again. I wasn't angry at this point until she hung up on me. This is the second and last time they've done this. Beware.",

We got chicken liver pate. The most disappointing meal I had in New Orleans. They also don't have a menu online. \nOnly good thing is the space is trendy and cool looking.

They have a nice bar inside, and cozy happy hour or cocktail seating outside.  The bar inside has nice big screen televisions, and from the banquette/table seating on the opposite wall we could enjoy our lovely early dinner and watch the Saints game at the bar.  Station 6 is a definite keeper on our rotation of eateries.  The seafood is ecclectically spiced and carried out very well.  We had the raw oysters which were fine.  For entrees we enjoyed the pompano with curried brown butter and the blackened snapper with delery sauce.  The preparations were exceptional, and the portions were very generous.  We did not have room for dessert, but hope to try their daily cobbler on our next trip. Station 6 is Excellent.",

So he calls us and tells us to come in after we had sent him pictures and talked on the phone about what we wanted but it wasn't until 4 We go in and it's the exact same tattoo so we told him that mine was a little different like we talked about he was super sweet about redrawing it up but it took another 2 hours and then about another hour to set up. So none the less we didn't start the tattoos until 8 and it was a Monday my husband and I had to work early the next day. So he finishes my husbands tattoo after about 4 hours which was beautiful. Even though it was super late he wanted to do it. He basically hauled ass through my tattoo and now it's only been about 4 months and there is a random line through my tattoo. It's not colored in all the way and my purple flower has turned brown. My husband called about getting touch up but they said Danny isn't even there anymore. I just didn't want my tattoo messed up even more than it already is so I'm going to have to pay for another tattoo artist to fix it. The place was nice and clean but the experience was horrible.",

It is located on the third floor of a casino and can be confused with the steakhouse downstairs. \n\nOne of the days, the wait time was pretty ridiculous. It took about 25 minutes to get seated, then another 20 for the waiter to make her way over to ask us for our drink order. The second visit had a brief wait time and the service was much more efficient. \n\nThe food itself here isn't the highest of quality but is quite large and cheap. An example is the steak and fries (pic will be provided) was only $5 and tasted pretty good. The salads and soups aren't too bad either. Salads are simple with dressing and croutons laid upon some fresh greens. I highly recommend looking at the Cal Neva originals on he menu first because some of them, like the burrito my brother ordered, was huge and delicious.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone wanting some cheap but large portioned food.",

Nothing left but one ok room, one handicap and no lake view. They said they were all booked out. I wonder why they can't reserve our rooms knowing we booked and paid extra for specific locations. They tried to fight it saying that Expedia never provides proper channels of communication and that it's not their fault. Fine. At least give us a discount right? I also had a horrible night only to realize my restless sleep was due to 30 high school kids banging and screaming until 5am. I'm assuming the kids got my lake view but yet we paid over $60 per each room for an upgrade. \nSo I'm pretty tired, grouchy and frustrated. Also, cleaning was inconsistent. One day they clean and two others they didn't.... not sure why. \n\nExpedia and Marriott, please communicate better on your deals and description. And for your consumer willing to pay more, please put them on a separate list. Nothing is more frustrating than knowing that I got ripped off and that I was surrounded by high school kids that got better rooms than me.j",

We showed up on Friday night and the bar was busy, but not near as crowded as I thought it might be.  They don't have a cocktail menu, but they have Russian Standard vodka and a great whiskey selection, which is all we need.  We were greeted by someone that took our name and checked back on us regularly while we chilled in the bar.  There are only a handful of tables in the bar, and the area upstairs also has limited seating, but upstairs are these big leather couches and chairs with coffee tables and small tables.  The feel is if you are sitting in your best friend's house that just happens to have a great kitchen staff and several people that are purely there to make sure you have anything you need.  The decor is absolutely perfect and the historic building is stunning.  After seeing people in the bar order burgers and fries that looked and smelled amazing, I already knew what I wanted.  We were shown upstairs around 35 minutes after we arrived, and we started with the bacon wrapped figs, which are outstanding.  I ordered the burger and fries and they were both perfect.  GF ordered the salmon, but replaced with fries, which is not her normal order, but she was not disappointed and the salmon was great.  We could have sat there all night and were taken care of so perfectly neither of us wanted to leave.  This will absolutely be one of our regular places, and it was one of our best nights out recently.  Thanks so much to all of the staff that took such great care of us.",

Worth every penny. Available, flexible, communicative, make you feel comfortable, will work with you to achieve your vision, and they know people or are experienced with most venues.

  "text": "Very, very similar to what was here before. \n\nThey're working with a fairly small space for a grocery so I think they do a decent job with what they have. A few of the standouts during my visit include the impressive cheese counter with big wheels ready for fresh packaging, an impressive salad bar and wine and dessert cases. I also noticed that this Kroger has adopted the new prepared meals concept (similar to Blue Apron). The flower section was meh -they could use a larger variety of offerings and the prices always seem so salty compared to Trader Joe's and Aldi. \n\nThe parking makes this spot a winner- first and second floors of the building (covered) and free. You can also find street parking and bike parking easily. It would hurt for them to offer some of the interactive tasty stations and heightened elements that other groceries are now offering.",

I went for Thai: Tom Yum Goong, Pad See Ew and a few Sing Ha beers. Also, some Prik Nam Pla to bring the fire. The food was pretty good and the service friendly, if not the fastest. So, a pretty good place all-in-all. I do recommend Yoshi and will definitely be back to try their Sushi and, this time, I'll change my beer order to Kirin.",

  "text": "After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to take my car here for an oil change, break pad inspection, and brake fluid flush. I drove a little further for this place (~3.5 miles) because of the good reviews. I called the day before and made and appointment for 2:00 the following day. I got my car there at 2 on the dot and was a bit disappointed that they didn't have a shuttle service. I was told that if I wanted to wait they would be starting to work on it in about 25 minutes. I elected to pay ~$7 for a Lyft home instead of sitting and waiting. I did not get a call from them until 3:50 telling me what needed to be done (nothing had been done at this point). I asked what time it would be ready and the guy sounded irritated and said \"some time before closing\". I arrived at 6:15 to pick my car up (45 minutes before they close) and the car still wasn't ready. I ended up waiting until 7:15 for my car when it was dropped off at 2:00 with an appointment. The other thing that I was unhappy about was i ended up paying $400 for an oil change, brake flush, and cleaning of my brakes. Also, I specifically told them I wanted full Synthetic oil and I was given semi-synthetic. Very unhappy with the service, wait times, and price. Do not go here despite all the other positive reviews.",

  "text": "We were treated like refugees coming across the border. Being a \"Platinum for Life\" member means nothing to this location so just be prepared for a world of disappointment and of poor treatment. Both of our Credit cards were charged for the same room and that shouldn't have been; we were told that we BOTH had to have a card on file for the same room we were sharing as family(nowhere in the world has THAT happened!) and the three night stay had been reduced to one without knowledge of or permission unless we paid double the original booking rate. When a call to Platinum Guest Services was made, they begrudgingly 'found' our reservation for our room for the three nights. We had requested foam pillows, we had none. We requested luggage racks, we had none. The front desk staff must hate their jobs as they're much too consumed in a game of 'slap and tickle' with each other and seem quite put out to wait on guests. Curt words used to interrupt guests made one feel that you were imposing on them to do the simplest thing like oh, check you in. \nThe room on the 16th floor: the rusted fixtures with an extra layer of dust, grease and regret on them gave a creepy feel as well as an odd smell to the room. There was absolutely never any hot water and the lack of water pressure meant that it would indeed catch you with soap in your eyes and/or shampoo in your hair when the water would shudder to a trickle . That was followed by a cold blast of water from the faucet that would hit your feet as you fumbled to get the shower to work again. Talking to the front desk staff is exhausting and you won't get any help whatsoever. The room itself reeked of dirty socks and sweat.\nConcierge Breakfast/Snacks: sadly, this is much worse than the rooms, if possible. Hot things were cold, cold things were warm, pretty sure if the health department had been called it would've been closed. Coffee was always luke-warm but the worse was Saturday night/Sunday morning when they 'closed'. The cold, days old coffee was left out so elite level guests would go to get a cup only to get a cup of ice-cold sadness. The trash at the coffee area was overflowing to the point it was stacked on the counter area. This is visible to arriving guests no matter what their level was. ALL bottled water was removed in an attempt to force one to use the bigger $3.50 bottle of the same stuff in the room. When I approached the front desk to alert them to the matter, they were once again poking and playing with each other in a way that made me uncomfortable to see. I checked back an hour later and it was worse than before. We left Sunday morning saddened that the hotel was such a mess in so many ways. \nStay #2: Again, Platinum member checking in at 7:45 PM and you would have thought we asked the desk clerk to wax her mustache. We gave her our name for the room but she couldn't spell it. We started to spell it to be helpful but she rudely cut us off saying she could find it. \"Frau Blücher\" couldn't. We spelled the name for her twice only to have her scowl at us as if we had said something nasty to her. She finally found the reservation but acted as if we had none. She scowled at us again and said we could have a king room with a pullout or rent a bed. No, we had requested two beds for two grownups. We also needed foam pillows due to allergies to feather, as requested in the reservation and in our profiles. We were cut off by Frau Blücher again and told, \"The hotel is sold out. We have no more pillows for you\".  Another desk agent recognized us from when we checked in the first time days before and panicked. She said she would try to get us two foam pillows. In a while a young man came to the room with the frick and frack of pillows; one under-filled one and one of those monstrous egg-shaped weird ones that no one can use. The room itself was like an afterthought or a poorly pieced together puzzle: the bathroom is hidden down a creepy, narrow, dark hallway barely wide enough for a petite woman of 98 lbs and 4 ft tall. The door opens in the middle of the room and onto this awkward kitchen counter space with a microwave and fridge on it. It makes no sense at all and blocks part of the entry to the creepy bathroom hall. The airflow in the room is completely obstructed by the weird counter thing and the fact that the air handler is in the creepy hallway. So the room temperature fluctuated between like a bi-polar person with insomnia. You can also throw a cat ass-first under the room door - the crack is that large.The water was luke-warm but the pressure on the 15th floor seems a tad bit better. I would compare it to the shower water pressure in a 500 year old youth hostel in the south of France. I hope that gives the proper visual to those whom have experienced that.",

We got our order and the cashier offered us a drink for the long wait. My mom was already sitting at the table waiting. As I walked off I heard the manager yelling at the cashier about why he took our order because she was ready to close and he better give her the 1.09 for the drink he gave me! I Sat down to eat with my mom and the manager then yells at us that we can't eat here. I said we came inside to be able to eat here. My mom has trouble getting around and we were looking forward to our meal there. She says we're closed and you can't be in here, you all need to leave right now. I said we got here way before closing time to eat here and we would've already been done if we didn't have to wait so long for an employee to appear. I said I've never been kicked out of a McDonald's before and it's because people are allowed to be there to eat their meal as long as they arrive before closing. I said at least let my mom eat, she hasn't eaten and is starving. She said no ya'll have to get out of this place. My mom had to get all her stuff together and struggle back to the car. We ate in the car with difficulty dropping lettuce full of sauce on ourselves and the car from the big Macs. As we Sat in the car we watched as the door stayed open with a wet floor cone and no employees going home. Later I had to clean the car from this uncomfortable meal. Manager said her name was Pam. Worst manager ever! Even the 2 employees that were there were embarrassed and tried oppologizing for her. Actually the cashier that took our order was about to clock out but took our order since no one else was coming. I will never eat here again!",

I liked the fact that the place was busy but I still felt I was able to have a good conversation throughout the meal. Tables are arranged in a way you don't feel packed in but has lots of seating options. Staff was very friendly and in general the place has a nice atmosphere. The location is within the long strip mall on 99 st, so if you're driving south towards it, best to turn at the lights just before, as the road can be quite busy at certain times of days making a left turn difficult.\n\nFood arrived very quickly! It was hot, fresh and great tasting. The spring rolls we ordered ahead of time were the perfect amount to add to the meal. Vermicelli bowl and rice dish are both very reasonable costs and we were very happy with our choices. I think the next time I've got more apatite I'll try the rice dish as it also comes with a small bowl of soup. Definitely will be back again!",

I don't even live in the area, but was able to 'walkthrough' the house thanks to Kevin's 3D walkthrough he was able to put together and send me very quickly. That's one of the neat things I've noticed about Kevin: He looks for ways to solve his client's problems. He opened a second company that helps his clients with staging and handyman repairs (even renovations). That experience was super helpful in our deal as well since the city hit the sellers with code violations during our transaction. Kevin always negotiated hard for us and ended up helping us get $15,000 off the price of the house during escrow! He's trusting and really does provide more than most for his clients -- well, at least he did for me. When it comes time to sell, we will definitely be using him as we know he'll walk us through any recommended improvements and will know the most efficient, cost-effective vendors to use as well. 5 stars!!",

But I  am only giving this a 1 star because you can't give 0 stars. This was the worst service I have ever received from a restaurant. We had reservations at 6:30 for my mom and I's birthday. Got seated at 6:30, waited over and hr and a half for our food, in the mean time our waitress was MIA several times so we were unable to get refills or even check in on our food. Finally a little over 2 hrs later we got our food which wasn't anything to talk about. Our waitress was not apologetic at all and acted like this was okay, and we never saw a manager to talk to. Anyways, 4 hrs later we were able to leave. Needless to say, we will NEVER be going back. Save yourself and go somewhere else",

  "text": "I lived in Lansdale for about 8 years and this was the place I used to go to for Chinese because it was the nearest.  The food is your average Americanized Chinese food, nothing to write home about, but if you got that bad Chinese food craving, it's not the worst place in the world in terms of their food.  What makes this the place to avoid is their delivery service.  They take forever, and I've had a delivery guy, who spoke very little English, who refused to let me use the coupon from their own advertisement, and have the audacity to ask for more tip.  I'm an immigrant myself and I like to support foreign people who work hard, but not if they lie and have bad manners (I'm just old fashioned that way).  So I started driving over 15 min if I wanted Chinese food from there on until I moved away.  So if you're visiting Lansdale and think you want Chinese food, just go get yourself some pizza instead (I'd recommend Olces, though they aren't technically in Lansdale).",

  "text": "Conveniently located about 5-7 minutes away from the airport, this Enterprise was one of the better rental car experiences I've had. It only took a few minutes to book the rental online and they called a day ahead to confirm my reservation as well as let us know what documents would be required to secure the rental.\n\nUpon arrival, we were warmly greeted and promptly provided keys. Trey assisted us with picking up and inspecting the rental vehicle upon return. He was so pleasant, polite, knowledgeable, and eager to assist. He was our first impression of Southern hospitality and really got our vacation off to a great start. I liked that after returning the vehicle, we were asked if we needed a ride anywhere and they were so kind as to deliver us back to the airport. Trey also asked how we felt about their customer service before we left which I found to be a nice touch from Enterprise.\n\nI would have given 5 stars but the vehicle we rented was pretty dirty / in need of a wash on the exterior , although the interior was clean and it had a 14 inch crack in the driver's side of the front windshield which Trey asked  whether would be too distracting to drive. While I appreciated him acknowledging the giant crack and gaining manager approval to offer a discount because of it, I don't think a vehicle with such a huge crack in the windshield should remain part of rental inventory at all. On this day, it was also the only available vehicle of its class and capacity so we went with it.",

  "text": "The stadium DSW is my favorite place to shop for shoes! Located in the same plaza as Home Depot, Nordstrom Rack, Target, Whole Foods & many more businesses, one can accomplish many shopping objectives without even leaving the parking lot! However, getting OUT of the parking lot often requires a great deal of patience. There are basically two main ways in and out, and that is just not sufficient for a business plaza of this size. \n\nRegardless, DSW makes the trip worth the hassle. They have a wide variety of women's shoes and bags in plenty of sizes and colors at incredibly reasonable prices! Their sale section is located at the rear of the store which is similar to most locations, and the shoes are all in pretty good order. If you're looking for something particular, you can try to hunt down a DSW rep (which can be a little hard to do if they're real busy). I have also noticed that the employees don't exactly seek you out to offer help after you've been greeted at the front entrance. \n\nBeing part of their Member Rewards program is completely free and for those looking to save a few dollars, I have found it to be very beneficial as they mail discount coupons and cards to your home. You also get a birthday coupon during your birthday month which - if memory serves me correctly - is a $10 certificate to spend in-store or online! \n\nAlso, if you are ever searching for a shoe in your size that DSW doesn't have in stock, they will offer to order it from their headquarters and either mail it to your home or you can pick them up in-store.\n\nWhile I find that DSW sells solid brand-name shoes of high quality, today I discovered that two of the pairs I purchased had some defective marks around the toe area (something that I missed while in-store). I took them back as soon as I noticed and switched them out for something comparable with no defects. After this experience, I will always be sure to triple-check the shoes I am purchasing to avoid multiple trips. But you'd better believe that I will be back soon to use my new $20 coupon!",

I waddled in here on a snowy Saturday, and the vibe was perfect for a boozy blizzard snow crawl. They boast many signature cocktails, and honestly, I had a hard time choosing. The drinks are about $10-11 a pop, which is honestly a steal because their vodka is as smooth as it comes. Most of the time, vodka shoots me back to memories of my worst college hangovers, but I left Stateside with nothing but love in my tummy. \n\nThe bartenders were lovely and precise in their mixology, and the drinks were amazing. One came with an ice cube that had FLOWERS frozen into it. It was BEAUTIFUL and made me feel like a fancy, classy lady - this was the \"Winter is Coming\" cocktail, just incase you're searching for a very instagrammable drink. I chose the Philadelphia Politics, a pink, lemony gin/vodka concoction. It was palatable, smooth, and sophisticated. These are not words I typically throw into a Yelp review, so you know it's sincere.\n\nThere was lots of room to sit or stand on the day and time we came here, but I could see how this place could very easily get crowded. They do offer tours and a delicious, unique bar food menu, but I can't comment much on either as I just stuck to my drink. The music, however, was the best playlist of jams to sing along to - I can NEVER resist the \"BAH BAH BAHHHH\" of Sweet Caroline, no matter the setting. \n\nI'm definitely keen to come back here. It's a great hang for a girls day or date night, and definitely worth EVERY penny!",

They use local, fresh, organic ingredients and I believe the restaurant is 100% powdered by wind which is so cool!\n\nIve had everything from coffee and a cookie to juices to salads to veggie burgers. I have never been disappointed. Its also a great spot to hang for a while if you need to do work or have a meeting, etc. There is a great little area in the back with so much natural light.

In addition each employee was polite , courteous and friendly and obviously enjoyed their jobs. Such a pleasure to deal with. I highly recommend them and will definitely be back for any future needs or wants. \nFor reference I purchased : Ancher Folding Electric Mountain Bike with Alloy 6-spoke Integrated wheels and large capacity battery.\nPs : I brought them some Dunkin Donuts to enjoy for the remaining hours at work.",

It's honestly exactly what I want when I go out to eat... endless salad (that is actually fresh and not wilted), homemade soups, and tasty muffins/desserts. I like that there's a rotating menu so you can try a variety of items. My favorites are the quinoa salad, the chicken noodle soup, tomato bisque, cheesy garlic bread, and the traditional Mac and Cheese. The staff is always friendly at the Broadway location and someone is always there to scoop up an empty plate. I routinely get coupons in the mail as well! Fair prices for such a wide selection.",

  "text": "This is a review for the Half Marathon component of this race. \n\nWhile the race course was OK, that stretch of 3.5-4 miles straight without porta potties between the Columbus Blvd. area and Drexel University was incredibly painful, especially after I had to skip the previous one or two potty stops due to the few stalls and insanely long lines at each stop in the first 4-ish miles of the race. For a race of this size and pricing, it was unacceptable not to have anywhere to pee for the first 8 miles! I'm not even sure whether this helped or hurt my pace... Did trying to find a place to pee make me run faster or was I so uncomfortable that I pretty much hobbled from Columbus Blvd all the way to University City? \n\nAlso, the post-race refreshments were weak, highlighted by cold/stale/cement-hard Philly pretzels and preserved fruit cups. (They did have bananas, though, which I do appreciate.) In contrast, other half marathons I've been to this year (all of which had lower entry fees) provided varieties of fresh bagels, fresh doughnuts, multiple bottles of water/gatorade per runner, whole fruits, protein bars, yogurt, hot New England clam chowder, flavored water ice, pizza, and/or hot pancake/bacon/sausage breakfasts. Some of those races also provided free race photos, whereas photo packages for this race are ~$50-100. \n\nTo top it all off, the medal design was horrendous this year. I loved the 2015 medal design with the Liberty Bell and ring around it, and supposedly they chose to do the bell again this year \"by popular demand,\" but instead of a classy-looking frame for the bell like in the 2015 design, the bell this year was supported by two thin rods fixed on top of a rectangular base - so cheaply made that the bell came off the base when a runner accidentally dropped it. The bells also actually rang, which was kind of cool for the first 2 minutes, but then I started getting a migraine being surrounded by thousands of ringing bells all over the Art Museum area. \n\nOverall, I liked the more city-centric course this year, and even the parts that went through Fairmount Park. The water stations were well-spaced out, though I didn't use them so I could avoid having to pee even more. However, among the 11 organized races that I ran this year, I'd rank this one in the bottom tier and probably won't sign up for it again.",

We thought we would give this place a try but was wrong about this place. The food was horrible. We ordered conch fritters as an appetizer and for our main meal my husband and I attempted to share oysters on the half shell, baked oysters, and the shrimp special. The baked oysters and shrimp weren't awful but they were not great for the price. The oysters on the half shell had beesitting there for awhile you could tell. They were not even close to fresh and we did not eat them!! They did remove them from the bill. Total our bill was $54 minus the oysters on the half shell plus 2 beers. For the price of this place it is ridiculous. I am usually easy going and can enjoy any restaurant, NOT THIS PLACE!!!",

We were craving charbroiled oysters and headed to Acme Oyster Co. in the French Quarter because it was walking distance from our hotel. The line was around the block. Drago's is fantastic but it was too far to walk and we didn't want to mess with the trolly to get there. We decided to just go back to our hotel on Common St. and just grab anything available. We started to walk past Gallier's but stopped to look at the menu. Charbroiled oysters! We said \"why not?\" GREAT decision. We got seated right away but the place was still vibrant and active. In short, the food, the service, the staff, and the ambience was EXCELLENT! This place is truly a treasure.

The light seasoning really allowed us to appreciate the meat. The sushi was very good- a little over priced for the area but I don't mind paying for food that is worth it and it was. I would be going there more often if it was closer to our work and home near the main line area. I have recommended this place to many people I know.",

The only thing I'd say is bring earplugs because it's rather noisy at times between the parties on the patio, the pigeons in the a/c unit, the church next door, ha ha.

  "text": "I picked Luke solely because it was one of the few restaurants open on Christmas for dinner. It is a hotel restaurant with a generic NOLA menu, raw seafood to steak. The cuisine tilts toward French what with rabbit pate, crab en ravigote, etc. Some dishes are served en cocotte, small cast iron deep pans, and the portions are fairly large, perfect to split. After ordering the mixed seafood platter and waiting a while we received without explanation a slightly altered variation. When we inquired we were told the kitchen had run out of one of the items, so they had upped the oysters. Had to send it back, because one of us can't eat oysters and miffed that the plate was plopped on the table without any explanation. One of the two servers who took care of our table was an absolutely clueless airhead. Luckily, we had the better one wait on us the rest of the meal.\nAs a second alternative,  we had the boiled gulf shrimp, not deveined and unpeeled. Somewhat messy to eat and the veins soiled the whole experience by making the texture somewhat gritty. The server brought us soaking wet napkins to wipe our hands. LOL. \nWe split the grilled drum and ended with a simple salad, both fairly good. \nThe kitchen is not where the restaurant is and I think the temperature of the dishes suffer for the distance, the room temp.  fish and accompanying veggies, as well as the butter emulsion, almost solidified. \nThe space is large with a handsome main dining room, a pressed tin ceiling and a dark wood bar, newspapers hanging on dowels. I'd avoid the rear room/the Siberia.",

The restaurant was still hopping with people, which is always a good sign.\n\nThere were four of us and we all tried something different.  Our table got the Hot Chicken and Cheddar sandwich, the Hot Chicken B&B, and the Hot Chicken entrée.  I got the Beer Butt Chicken--even though I could not eat a quarter of it, I got the whole chicken because that was the best presentation.\n\nAll of our food was outstanding.  My Beer Butt Chicken was so delicious--smoked chicken but still moist.  I got a side of collard greens and they were amazing as well.  \n\nFor those at the table who got the anything that said \"hot chicken\" on the menu, our waitress warned us that if you like \"Hot\" chicken wings, you should order mild.  We went with medium.  It was definitely hot.  One person at the table said that while the medium was good, he would go mild next time so he could really enjoy the chicken.\n\nThe beignets that were served with the Hot Chicken B&B were really good too.  The sweetness of the beignets mixed with the salty, spicy chicken were really good.\n\nParty Fowl also has a good craft beer selection.\n\nI will definitely be back!",

I'm originally from Hawaii, so I have a biased opinion when it comes to all things poke, but this place is not bad.\n\nI have tried two different bowls, one with rice and other with Spring mix. The first bowl I got was with spring mix topped with hamachi, tuna, salmon and scallops. I got it with the garlic soy. It wasn't bad. I just wish I had opted out of the scallops. I didn't like them at all. The second bowl I got was with sushi rice and spicy tuna. This bowl was pretty good with the spicy aioli and unagi sauce. The one thing I really like about this place is how generous they are on their serving size. A regular bowl is more than enough to get your fish craving satisfied!\n\nThe two girls at the counter were very friendly and very fast at getting my poke bowl made.

  "text": "I drove 45 minutes from PA because a friend from Portland gave me a $100 gift certificate to Kabuki Japanese RESTAURANT. The food was very good but took long to come out. The owner refused to accept it saying it's from the Philly location which was false. It should work anywhere with this name. There are hundreds of hibachi restaurants near me, I wouldn't drive this far to do business with this shady owner. I thought about giving two or three stars but honestly I didn't like the attitude I got from him. As Gordon Ramsay would say \"A restaurant making excuses is a failing restaurant\"",

My company and I were here for a trade show so we tried to hit up as many delicious restaurants and I'm glad we came here. \n\nLOCATION: Parking can be tricky but we got really lucky by getting a sweet spot on the street right by the entrance. It's located on a main street where you can see tour buses and carriages driving by - it's really cute. Ample outside seating and the inside area is enormous! \n\nFOOD: Where do I start? You need to try their special drinks. They made their spirits in-house so you gotta try it! We shared a salad, eggs rolls, and the baked mac-n-cheese. Salad didn't blow me away, eggs rolls were okay, but the mac-n-cheese was out of this world. YUM. My entree was the Lemongrass Shrimp. My coworker ordered the garlic shrimp and I think those were better!! \n\nSERVICE: Oh yeah, make sure to make reservations because it gets crazy busy here at all times. \n\nWill I come back? Yeah and next time I'll just order drinks!",

Every bite is very yummy.  Must try the Martinis.  We tried their Martini with Vodka and Lemon drop Martinis.  It went really well with our entrees.

K&S offers a variety of international food and products, but the quality of these items may not be as fresh as you would like them to be. The seafood section is my favorite, mainly since they usually have live fish and crab for reasonable prices. As someone who lives in an area with little diversity, this market is probably one of the better markets where you'll get when looking for items not typically sold in grocery stores. You could go somewhere for a certain genre of food selections, but when you just need a place of variety then I would check out this place.

  "text": "I had no idea that this place existed until I purchased a groupon. The restaurant isn't anything fancy, but fairly clean. We were greated by a very friendly lady who's service was very attentive. We were the only people in the restaurant when we got there, but soon after, more people showed up, and it seemed to be very popular with the 'skip the dishes' as there were numerous orders being delivered when we were there. There are a few pics up on the walls to give you an idea of what the orders look like. We ordered two different plates of noodles, one with seafood, the other with chicken, and some dumplings. Plate portions are huge, so sharing is suggested. From the time we ordered until the time we got our food was pretty fast. The flavors didn't disappoint at all. The taste of their hand pulled noodles was very fresh, and wasan't bathed in layers of goopy sauces, very simple flavors and spices. The dumplings we had were really good too. Next time I think I will ask to have them pan fried instead of boiled as I missed the crunchiness that I'm used to having, nonetheless, the dumplings were very flavorful  and filling. The order we got had  10 dumplings, so needless to say some came home with us.\nAll in all, we were very impressed with food. We've been to other noodle houses and this one campares to the higher end places that we've visited minus the fancy decor. Parking in this area can be a challenge as it's right in the heart of chinatown.Next time I would like to try one of their soups to see how those play out. Also, I think they need to take pics of their food so that patrons know what they're buying and the menu needs to be revamped to give better descriptions of what each order is.",

  "text": "Me and my sister came for the Pay What You Wish admission day (first Sunday of every month), but the cool thing about this little museum is the option to always pay what you wish, although there are suggested prices listed at the register. We had plenty of fun having a photo shoot inside and outside of the museum, imitating the statues. The statues themselves are really spectacular works of art, but there unfortunately aren't enough pieces to occupy yourself for more than 15 minutes, unless you take advantage of the sketchpads located in at least two locations in this museum. I can't really see myself coming back soon, but I had fun.",

  "text": "Alma de Cuba is a beautiful establishment that gives off an unique casablanca vibe with its high ceilings, soft music, and well-dressed servers. If you take out its ambiance and eccentric charms, however, you are left with slightly overpriced, but good, fancy cuban dining. We came to this joint after an exhaustive day at work and were immediately surprised by the sheer height of the restaurant (three flights of stairs). We shared a flight of cerviche, including the mojito shrimp, yellow tail tiradito and the agua chile cobia, followed by smoked marlin tacos, oxtail croquetas, and we shared the lechon asado. My favorite was actually the oxtail croquetas, served over a giant slab of semi-sectioned leg bone with scrappable marrow at your disposal. I tried the classico mojito...it was good, but nothing to extraordinary. The cerviche came in three small bowls, maybe 1-2 bites total and cost about $30 and the two appetizers were about $16 per piece. While the oxtail was worth it, the over-fried fish tacos were definitely skippable. Finally for the lechon...what can I say, it's hard to find lechon, but as Ala de Cuba proved, it's also hard to make it. The lechon was served over a bed of bacon congri rice, but the meat was so salty, and the skin so dry that it felt like chewing on a tree bark.\n\nAt the end of the day, Alma De Cuba is a place that you'd bring your date to impress him/her, but not a place you'd bring your foodie husband/wife. \n\nFood: 3 stars\nService: 4 stars\nPrice: 3 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars",

  "text": "Great food. Service is ok.\nStarted off on the wrong note with this place. It's quite frustrating to be excited about a new place in your neighborhood, but they appear to not really want your business. \n\nI tried twice to get there in time after work before they pre-emptively closed, but finally got there twice. The food is really good. Probably tied for my favorite Crab Rangoons in town, and I love an appetizer spring roll.\n\nTheir lunch special is a great deal!  Stir Fry for $5.45, extra $ for fried rice, and Pho lunch for $6.45.  With both, you can add on an additional appetizer/side for about $1, so even with some add-ons or a beverage, you can stay well under $10!  Also, I'm glad they don't default include a soft drink in the lunch deal.  There are so many beverages I could want, why force soda or iced tea on me.  This works particularly well at Super Bowl as they have a wide variety of unique beverages.  I love the hot jasmine tea, but they have Boba tea, milk tea, Thai Coffee and tea, and others! \n\nThe menu has much more variety than I expected, so don't shy away if someone in your group isn't a pho fan, they can order sweet and sour or a bahn mi or other options!\n\nHours/service not the gleaming example but I got what I ordered in a timely fashion and the food was very good and inexpensive. period.

The wontons were literally just ravioli. Those crisps on the salad are from Thai cuisine, not Chinese. Why do you have to put mint in everything?? Also, this \"Christmas special\" thing a total ripoff. $40-50 for a meal? You can order real Chinese food for a quarter of that price. I feel personally insulted that you would call yourself a Chinese restaurant. The only reason I'm rating this two stars instead of one is that the wonton cheesecake was pretty good.",

When we picked it up to remind them that it was substituted, they stated they don't substitute anything. Fine, is what it is. We then noticed before leaving the parking lot that it had cheese on it and when we went back to ask for a refund, they tried to make us another, but after everything, we insisted on a refund.

I think you may want to discuss the quality control in your kitchen his answer was yeah I'll probably mention that to them. Overall service by the waitress was excellent",

I wouldn't consider this \"cheap\" pho, and I feel that the larger serving size is not exactly more noodles, but just more broth.  If the pho wasn't so good, I would have given them 3 stars for the inconsistent service and the pricing, but the broth is just THAT good.  \n\nFree wifi available.\n\nLots of parking in the area, but because they share the same little corner as the bank and the pet store, it can get a little busy.",

I ordered the Lobster Bisque cup with a puff pastry (DELICIOUS) Brussel Sprouts (My favorite out of any restaurant around) & I tried the Popcorn Shrimp which were tasty as well. I ordered the Spicy Guava-rita which was sweet & spicy. I sat a while without any drinks but that won't stop me from visiting my favorite fish house. I will definitely be back..\n\n**UPDATE**\nManagement here is hands down, the best. Due to an Insurance Claim for evacuating my home in relation to the Thomas Fire. I needed an itemized receipt. Diego, the manager did all he could possibly do in effort to find my receipt/transaction. It was a pleasure working with someone who follows through and puts in that much effort to follow up and complete my request. A+ Fish Enterprise & Wonderful Ahi Tartar!",

The salsa was very unique with a thicker base than most. The Mahi Mahi tacos were great but I laughed when the menu said \"large tortillas\" and they were probably the smallest I've ever seen.\n\nMy colleagues enjoyed the enchiladas and burrito as well.

  "text": "Best chicken, bad service!\n- Overview: I came around 8-9pm on Friday to skip the dinner peak time. The wait was around 15 minutes. Parking is very limited. You can order takeout to avoid waiting.\n- The food: best hot fried chicken I've ever had. Not sure if it's the combination of hunger, the cold, and the excitement, but it was delicious. They were lots of tourists there when I came. They all talked among each other to see what to get. We got the hot chicken and a side of clucking hot sauce ($0.50). Even though my stomach did not greatly love me the next day, it was still so so good.\n- Service: We chatted with some guys in front of us in line who was visiting from Canada. The cashier gave him the wrong change. Luckily, he found out soon enough and the cashier was like, oh ok oopsie. Then we waited for our food and they forgot our side sauce and beer (he said he had accidentally given our beer to someone else instead). Ok I'm not expecting a full restaurant service experience, but these guys don't seem to care at all.\nWould I be back? Yes, definitely. Love the chicken. I'd probably do takeout next time!",

  "text": "My boyfriend in came to this place back in February for our first date and and LOVED it. So much so, that we invited another couple to come join us  here this past Saturday. So we went upstairs for dinner and were seated immediately, however after placing our orders the couple we came with received their food after about 40 minutes. When the waitress came by about 20 minutes after that we flagged her down to ask about our food. She said ours was taking longer because we requested separate checks at the beginning of our meal. Like her excuse made no sense. Another 10 minutes go by and only 1/2 of what we ordered comes out. At this point our waitress is gone and can't be bothered to come check on us. As another item trickles in 20 minutes later I ask for a manager. He comes by, apologizes and is nice enough to offer us drinks on the House. Our last item\nNever showed up by this point and he says, I took it off your bill, if they come out enjoy them on me. The waitress comes back at the end, and says \"I heard about what happened, but we can't go backwards so can I get you anything else\" we all request our checks. She only \"heard \" about what happened because she went missing and abandoned us after you took our order. My boyfriend pays in cash, and requests his change back, which is exactly $1. The nasty miserable excuse for a waitress brings him his change in all Nickels because she's pissed he requested his change back. I showed the manager and he made her some apologize, then offered To comp us a free hour of bowling for the trouble. It was a really bad experience to say the least. It sucks that \"our first date spot\" is now an empty low class place with Terrible Service. Do yourself a favor and skip this place!!",

  "text": "Bad experience - so disappointed after all the good reviews I had read.\n\nFirst the bad service -A few minutes after being served dessert the maître d' asked us to move to a new table to he could sit someone else. We hadn't even been at our table for that long. It ruined the whole evening. \n\nThis was on top of the wait staff going in and out of a back room with a very squeaky/noisy door opening and closing all night. Also they kept turning on and off the lights in the back room which shined into the main room. The menus were also stained with food. Very disappointing.\n\nNext the ok/bad food - they told me they refused to cook the shaking beef anything above well - I told her I was fine with it being more on the well done side to my liking but she wouldn't budge or even check with the kitchen - not very accommodating at all.\n\nFinally the bad cocktails - I ordered a bottle of sake. They serve it in a little box to drink out of. The waitress then went on an unsolicited 5 minute lecture when she poured me a glass into the box how Western sensibilities aren't sophisticated enough to drink out of overflowing sake boxes - totally bizarre.\n\nWe went early and the place which is pretty small to being with wasn't that crowded. The chef kept coming out into the dinning room and watched everyone eat. I think it's nice when the chef comes out but this was like every 5 minutes. \n\nOverall an odd disappointment - in my opinion go somewhere else - you'll enjoy it more.",

Woodside Farm Creamery does in fact fit that description. It's as good of an ice cream you'll find anywhere. They have lots of creative flavors like motor oil and dirt, and they have a peppermint spin to the classic mint chocolate chip. We were there at about 7:30 on a Wednesday night and there were two long lines filled with patrons. WFC's reputation in the region continues to grow, so be prepared to wait. \n\nI would offer a couple of suggestions, though. First, stop charging by the ounce. It really slows down the servers. They have to weigh everything, so it makes it harder for them when there's a large order of four or more ice cream cones to handle. They do have a food truck that they use for local events where they charge by the scoop. That would speed up things. \n\nAlso, they are cash (or local check) only establishment. Credit cards in this day and age is much faster. \n\nYou can see farm animals during your visit, too.",

The spirits are off the radar selections so right away i felt somewhere far away and special. My scotch was perfect and her martini was too.  The lighting in the dark room was just right and the noise never rose to that level where we could not hear each other in our normal talking voice. \n\nThe food had classic familiarity and simplicity. Dining at Billie Jean will be a perfect compliment to this trio of St. Louis' finest experiences (I Fratellini and Bar Les Freres). The Asian influence is meaningful, and even though i dislike the word fusion it fits. No bread here, instead a scallion pancake with a ginger hoisin soy sauce. Again it felt special and different. So tasty. We had the tuna poke style lettuce wraps which definitely pack a spicy punch but I loved them. The mushroom radicchio salad with the warm bacon dressing and parmigiana was - according to the successful chef who tried it next to me - the perfect flavor profile. Julie and I both loved it. I was very happy with the Asian flavored spare ribs perfectly tender and then a split swordfish with a parsley verde sauce so subtle we were able to experience the swordfish in its perfect preparation. Subtlety and style combine wth a bold atmosphere to make Billie Jean another reason Zoe is our towns finest creator and leader of the dining experience. And we can walk there.",

  "text": "I came here today December 2, 2017 around 6:00pm. I witnessed two young girls who work the register partake in very unsanitary behavior. They rang out customers at the front desk and proceeded to sit at a table in the dining area where they handled the cookies and cakes as if they were bags of chips.  They picked up the cookies to bag them for customers to purchase and in the process they are consuming the cookies. Eating over the cookies and dusting their hands over the cookies.  The young girl scratched her head, coughed in her hand, scratched her leg all while dealing and handling food for the guests. Went back to the register and returned to handling the cookies. If you have cashiers they shouldn't handle food until they've thoroughly washed their hands. This promotes disease and sickness.",

We love the atmosphere of the outdoor terrace in the summer months when they have live music some evenings. In the winter months we prefer the bar side where there's a handful of table tops or a nice L-shaped bar to find a seat.\n\nYou must start with the Zozo Shrimp for an appetizer. These are like the Bang Bang Shrimp from Bonefish if you've ever experienced those. For your entree I would recommend the Lasagna. It's fantastic and the salad is also delicious. Their house dress is good but they also have a homemade ranch which is really good. Out of all the Italian restaurants in town Iozzos is by far our favorite.",

The restaurant is small and cozy.. kind of feels like you are in a train car.\n\nHad an 8:30 reservation but when we arrived they told us that it didn't seem likely that a table would be available anytime soon and asked if we were okay to sit at the bar, which was fine.\n\nWe took our time and ordered 3 rounds of food at different times. All of the plates (including entrees) were on the smaller side but great to share.\n\nTo start, we had the fried chickpeas and potatoes. The chickpeas were well seasoned and the potatoes were crispy and drizzled with aioli. For our second round we had the Gouda cheese plate and the ricotta squash toast. The cheese was paired with garlic brushed bread and honey. The toast was phenomenal- butternut squash spread with a hint of salt from the ricotta topped with fresh vegetables. \n\nTo finish we had the meatballs and spinach ricotta gnudi. Both dishes were excellent. The gnudi was creamy melt in your mouth goodness. The meatballs were well prepared and served with more garlic brushed bread because you obviously can never have enough of that. \n\nThey had a good cocktail and wine selection though I stuck with a basic vodka soda. \n\nI loved every dish I tried here and honestly can't even pick a favorite because everything was so good. I highly recommend!",

The hash browns are done right and so are the eggs. If you ordered scrambled, you get actual eggs that are scrambled and not the kind that's poured from a carton. Oh and their coffee. A solid diner-style coffee, they're more than happy to keep refilling every minute or two.\n\nIf you're health conscious, you can help walk all this goodness off at the Santa Barbara Mission which is a mere 2 minute drive away.",

Hmm, we are in 2017, and you are telling me there is \"no way to track it\" or you just don't want to take the extra steps to do it? Clearly, unsettled by the response, but gave another week as Sales Rep suggested and still no call to let me know the table is in. We are now two weeks into December and understandably even more frustrated I called and asked to speak directly to a Manager. I was connected to Jen who took the time to look into my order and escalate it, as she agreed it should have been delivered by now. The table is supposed to be in next week and now free delivery!\n\nI am hoping there is no further delay. \n\nThank you Jen for stepping in, so far, and helping with the situation.

Spain is okay and there's cheap Portuguese. German wines there are dreck. American wines are pretty well represented, but like everywhere else, American wine is expensive if you want quality. The worst aspect of the store are the huge southwest-facing windows which let sunlight cook most of the wines on display. Why don't they pull down blinds in the afternoon? The sun also shines in your eyes, making shopping unpleasant. I rarely buy beer there for two reasons: 1)prices are higher than other places (but selection is good, I'll admit), 2) I've also gotten skunked beer there, so I question their handling of the product. Cashiers are notably grumpy --- sorry to bother you by making a purchase, my dears!  Website is godawful and useless. A high schooler could design a more informative site for Joe Canal's customers.",

The chicken is insanely, perfectly seasoned; I'm re-shocked each time I get it at how delicious this chicken is (and dang jealous cause I can never get anything to taste that good). Add some beans, rice, salsa, sour cream, all on some lettuce and voila! An excellent, rounded, filling meal! There's salsa on the table which I always dab on because *I like it hot* but it's certainly great all on its own.\n\nHappy hour specials pretty much every day, and they vary. I've had the 2-for-1 margaritas and 2 was more than enough to get a little buzz on. I almost forgot the BEST PART though! Free chips and queso dip when you sit are excellent as well! \n\nHighly recommend Sarita's, it's a great, locally-owned restaurant that takes pride in its product and consistently makes great food.",

We ordered drinks (wine) and table side guacamole for the table to start. She came back 20 minutes later and was sooooo rude!! She even yelled at one of us \"I got them right here\" when we asked for more chips bc we didn't see her whole tray. After that every time we wanted another drink we had to hunt her down. Side note: this establishment was NOT BUSY!! On top of that she got a couple drink orders wrong but we could t say anything because she would bring stuff to our table and disappear before we had a chance to speak. An hour later she returns for our food order....we had been there two hours already and couldn't be there all night and had really filled up on the chips bc we were starving when we got there so we all ordered soup. When we explained all this to the manager she decided to talk to the server WHILE WR WERE STILL THERE!!!! Hat was totally inappropriate!! We were still waiting on our bills. I woke up the next day to being charged twice for my bill!! We all agreed this wasn't the first time he service was beyond bad. I doubt any of us will ever be back!!

The positives are there are generally always sales, it's easy to get sizes and check out quickly, and they always offer you that extra step getting you a drink while you browse their small store. The negatives for me have to be how narrow the store is and the way it's set up seems very claustrophobic (I can't even get cell reception in there). And I find it strange how many employees they always have working in such a small store it seems excessive. It's like you have to go through layers of employees that all ask you what you want help with before you get to the end. I'm someone who likes to be left alone while shopping until I need some help so it's offputting to me but very helpful for other people that like more guidance. But I don't feel that's something to judge them too harshly on, more customer service is always better than not enough!",

Costco cake would have gone over better and cost half as much.\n\nThe reason I give it 3 stars Is their customer service was fantastic \nand had a red velvet from there once before in June  that was dynamite again really sweet but overall yummy",

  "text": "TL;DR this was NOT a good experience. While the atmosphere and waitress were nice, the food was the exact opposite. I ordered a 6oz steak, medium rare, with steamed broccoli and loaded mashed potatoes. What I got was a 4oz steak, cooked medium, with microwaved broccoli that was seasoned to hell and back, and mashed potatoes with cheese, also seasoned to hell. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the garlic butter that was put TO THE SIDE of the steak. Everything is overpriced as well, this was about $14. Every appetizer is at least $7.\n\nProtip: If you want good food, dress up real nice and go by yourself. They will think you're a food critic and go above and beyond to please you. Or you could go somewhere else and pay less for better food.",

  "text": "I like being adventurous with food, but when I find something that a place does well, I stick to it. And Johnny Chang's does a very good shrimp pad thai. I can't speak about their other selections, but I highly recommend that you try out their shrimp pad thai. I would regularly order it from Grubhub and the delivery is super speedy. \n\nNow, why do I like it so much? Well having attempted to make pad thai at home, I know how difficult it can be to do well. \nHere are the highlights:\n+ Doesn't skimp on the protein, like they seriously give enough shrimp for each bite. That's a serious win!\n+ Their sauce has a nice sweet & savory blend that is atypical of the more peanut-tamarindy variation. A squeeze of lime into the thick sauce is just perfect.\n+ Noodles have the right bite and length to them (and that's really hard to do!)\n\nI'm a fan and you should give them a try!",

  "text": "Ok... So we went here on Christmas Eve because they were open. The staff was super friendly. We ordered the shrimp remi poboy. We thought the shrimp maybe needed a little longer on the grill but everything looked and tasted fine so we ate it. Fast forward an hour later and my wife and I are both violently ill  with food poisoning. A plus to the servers, they were awesome. I would not eat there again after getting sick, though.",

  "text": "I recently purchased a home and when we moved in one of the carpets had stains (thought they may have been pet stains, but there wasn't as odor).  I wanted to start fresh and reached out for a steam clean of the carpet. Nick came out and was very knowledgeable, polite, and thorough.  He kept me informed of unexpected delays due to traffic. After discussing my options for the stains we decided that a deep clean would be better than just a maintenance steam clean. It turned out the stains were pet urine. The deep clean wasn't enough and when I informed Nick a couple days later he returned and did all he could to remove the pet odor. He continued to follow up with me on the status of the carpet over the course of a few days. I highly recommend In and Out Steamers. So much so I have requested Nick to clean the carpets at the rental home I am leaving. Grade A for professionalism!",

  "text": "So we've eaten at Zydeco's down the street from Salvo's and thoroughly enjoyed our meal there. We (my wife and I) were on our way to Zydeco's when we passed Salvo's and made the mistake of choosing to try it. \nI got the all you can eat boiled seafood special for $25.99 while my wife got the all you can eat fried shrimp and catfish special for $14.99. The best part of my meal was the room temperature sausage. The shrimp were dry and under seasoned. They obviously boil the seafood earlier in the day. By the time we arrived at 8pm the shrimp were no longer any good. The crabs were very dirty and had an overly powerful fishiness to them. The best part of my wife's food was the fries, which are the same they serve at Popeyes and Rally's. \nIt was when I tried my wife's fries that our night took a turn for the worse. Our waiter who was behind the counter about 10' from our table decided it was OK to scold me for trying my wife's plate. We immediately asked for our bill, didn't tip (for the first time in history; I supported myself for 10 years waiting and bar tending) and left very unhappy. Salvo's aggressiveness regarding sharing did not make us feel welcome. We will never return here, especially after bringing our unhappiness to the attention of the manager without even an ounce of concern. \nNow some might say a business has the right to enforce their policies, but I say they need to use some common sense. If two people sit down to eat, one orders an all you can eat special, and the other person orders a water, then go ahead and enforce your no sharing policy. If two people order two all you can eat dinners, you've got a nice warm place waiting for you in hell, if you feel that is an appropriate situation to call out your customers for trying each other's meals, from 10' away from their table. \nMy recommendation, spend a little more, go to Zydeco's, enjoy yourself, and don't worry about being verbally accosted by the wait staff.",

  "text": "Stopped by today to get flowers for my aunt and coffee filters. I don't usually go here but I was Christmas shopping nearby, so I figured I could run in.  I couldn't find the filters so I asked an employee for assistance who was having a conversation with a customer about Hawaii. I said excuse me, and was IGNORED. My mom asked another employee for help and was told she would page the manager. I was in the same isle as the rude employee when he got a page... he said I'm in aisle 6 and continued his conversation. THAT was the manager? The employees need to page a manager for coffee filters??? No wonder they're hiring. Never again. Im going to Whole Foods from now on, along with everyone else.",
