  "text": "This place was on my list for very long and finally I got the chance to give it a try.\nFirst of all, I have to say the owner and staffs are so friendly and welcoming. Great thumbs up for that!\nThe 4-star rating is all due to the food.\nI ordered the classic Cuban since it should be the signature dish. I hate to be so snobby but this is not a cheap cheap place with around $10 per sandwich. The portion size is huge for sure, but I really expected the ingredients can be better.\nThe texture of the bread is nice but so lacking good flavor.\nThe mustard and cheese are ok.\nThe roasted pork and ham have a dampened taste instead of pleasant porky aroma.\nAltogether, it is just a really bland sandwich (in terms of flavor but not salt) \n\nI also tried the special rice sides called Moros. The bacon bits are lovely but spice is a little overpowering.\n\nOverall, maybe it's just me that I am not a big fan of Cuban cuisine in general. But I feel it is a little bit overrated.",

I love sitting near the windows or the seats overlooking the center court. If you can help it, try not to drive around this area, there is always lots of cars coming through here and it always seems tight.",

  "text": "I first heard about Famoso's on the day we moved to Edmonton, when we asked a neighbour about good restaurants in the neighbourhood.  We discovered this place early on and it has remained a favourite since our arrival.  I am only half joking when I tell people that we bought our home in Oliver to stay within walking distance of this place.  It's truly fantastic.\n\nThe salads?  Outstanding.  Every single one.  And I have tried all the vegetarian ones.  The appetizers?  Delicious.  Again, every vegetarian one.  Desserts?  Spectacular.  All of them.  (We sometimes even walk to Famoso just to get a scoop of their gelato).  The wine?  Fantastic.  Every recommendation from the staff has been spot on.  The coffee?  Sublime.\n\nBut the main reason we come here is for the pizza.  It is simply wonderful.  Their thin crust is crisp, yet pliable, always cooked to perfection.  And every pizza combination we have tried has been superb (and we have tried every vegetarian pizza, in both red sauce and white sauce - I love that you can switch up the sauces!).  Their seasonal pizzas are always top-notch as well.  \n\nWe've never been disappointed when coming to Famoso, oh, except when the line is longer than we were hoping.  But an hour to wait for this meal is worth it!  Totally worth it.",

  "text": "Ended up walking into this place New Years since everywhere else had long lines. I had to admit at first site I was worried about the food. We were so hungry that we decided to just take the risk. I am so glad we did as we loved it so much we came back twice during our stay.\n\nTheir Jambalaya was wonderful and portion was just right. It had the perfect amount of spice. My boyfriend ordered the crawfish combo and he loved it. The next day we ordered their crawfish po boy and that was great as well. The only negative was their bread pudding it could have been much better.\n\nService was wonderful both times and that is saying a lot since for some reason New Orleans is not the place to find southern hospitality. \n\nI would definitely come back here if I am ever back in NOLA.",

  "text": "I was visiting my best friends sister on music row and she recommended Edgehill Cafe to us because we were looking to grab a quick bite to eat. I walked in around 10:30 and walked up to the counter and was told the kitchen was closed. Talk about feeling bummed out after looking over their tasty menu options. We were standing outside for about 10 minutes and got called back in because the kitchen was some how opening. I am not sure what happened, but I am sure glad I was able to order my Belgian waffle. I added bananas and chocolate chips for a .50 cent up charge and it took the waffle to the next level. The waffle is made with a cinnamon vanilla buckwheat batter and topped with walnuts and syrup. The waffle also comes with a side and I went with the bacon of course. It was nice thick and crispy. You can tell they only use the freshest of ingredients. The coffee mugs are a pretty decent size which allowed me to enjoy more of my peach white tea. \n\nWhat I thought made this cafe unique was that it served beer. This isn't your typical coffee shop. They have something for everyone. You also order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when its ready. The interior was very modern chic. I loved the tufted benches and light fixture in the larger dining area. They also have a really neat patio and lots of tables inside. I would recommend this place if you are looking to grab a quick breakfast.",

  "text": "Let's start off by saying I absolutely LOVE Schlafly beer! I will drink it over any other beer nowadays. However, Schlafly Bottleworks has a couple minor details to work on. \n\nCons\n \n- No wait service in the bar area. You must go to the bar to order everything and the 1 food runner/buser was not good at all about coming and cleaning off dirty dishes from the tables. I carried most of our dirty plates away myself b/c we ran out of room on the table. Yuck! Let's work on the service aspect guys.\n\n- The food is not that great. I would give the food 2.5 stars after multiple visits. \n\nPros \n\n- Awesome atmosphere. The bartender got up and sang a song with the band. Pretty laid back and friendly all around. \n\n- Kick ass, huge patio/beer garden in the summer, and they have live bands out there too. Always a fun time! \n\n- They host multiple beer festivals throughout the year.\n\n- Obviously, fantastic locally made micro brews. Pumpkin Ale, Oktoberfest, and Summer lager seasonals are my favorites!\n\nOverall, I LOVE SCHLAFLY. The end.",

  "text": "I love Jones for dinner, I have been there on multiple occasions and always had a great meal, great cocktails and great service. The food is very affordable, the cocktails can really add up though. It's definitely a one or two drinks with dinner type of place.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is great, it's got a modern retro diner feel with a fire place in the middle, very cool looking exposed stone as walls and the mural behind the bar of the 50s women playing with red balloons is awesome. Pretty much everything fits the theme from the chairs to the lights. I also like that the waiters and waitresses wear jeans and tshirts, I know I love my job more because I can go to work in jeans and a tshirt. \n\nNow as for brunch - I had a gift card and my boyfriend and I wanted brunch, I love Jones so I figured yesterday would be the perfect opportunity to try the brunch, take my boyfriend there who has never been and get a free or very cheap meal. We walked in around 2:15 (brunch lasts til 3) and were sat promptly. The restaurant was busy so maybe coming towards the end allowed us an immediate seat because the restaurant cleared out around 3. \n\nI got the BMW pancakes which were buttermilk pancakes with carmelized bananas and walnuts and maple syrup. Wasn't a fan of the bananas, but the pancakes were delicious. They give you way too much though, do people complain about getting too much food? haha.  It's literally three plate size pancakes that could easily fill two people. Definitely a good dish to share. The coffee is strong, the orange juice is fresh and the bloody marys are made to order (I got the classic jones mary with ketel one and olives stuffed with blue cheese - they get more interesting though - you can get jumbo shrimp, old bay on the rim, and countless other things.) \n\nThe only negative is that the waitress got my order wrong because apparently she misheard me so instead of BMW pancakes I originally got Potato pancakes. My dish had to get sent back while my boyfriends got a little cold sitting there because he was being polite.\n\nBut despite that, I definitely recommend it, I will definitely be returning.",

  "text": "Sugar....awwww honey honey! \n\nThis is a great corner brunch spot! On a lazy Sunday we strolled to Honeys Sit & Eat at the 4th street location for a late brunch. Honeys is a hip-sty cool spot with close seating & fun bar area.\nChalkboard menus adorn the walls with daily specials. Diner glass domes of sweets line the counter along with refreshed coffee cups and chatting locals. \n\nI love the laid back atmosphere of Honey's. The hostess was friendly and offered menus for kiddos and sat us right away. Our server was as laid back as can be but friendly.\n\nWe ordered the well known potato latkes with sour cream. These are fantastic and a must order. Crispy on the outside, squishy potato mash on the inside. My 8 year old devoured his immediately.\n\nLa Columbe coffee served here. A++ for that!\n\nKids had the egg sandwich on brioche bun & single pancake filled with chocolate. Pancakes are huge so for kiddos one is more than enough. My kids polished their plates... Thumbs up from the mini peeps.\n\nMy husband had the French toast special which was caramelized coconut & banana. Holy moly.. Yum! Gooey and sweet.\n\nI had the Toad In Hole which was by far my favorite. Hollandaise soaked Challah bread with a poached egg in the center topped with melted Jack cheese and truffle oil. Served with a side of spicy arugula with a tart lemon vinaigrette. To die for. The flavors were amazing together and the portion was just enough. \n\nOverall good experience. Only downside was we saw a couple come in and they sat so long without being served that they got up & walked out. Sadly they missed out on a crazy good toad in hole!",

  "text": "A trip to St Louis would not be complete without a stop to Ted Drewe's Frozen custard in the historic Dogtown neighborhood. This St Louis icon is perched right next to the famed route 66 Highway. Its façade is classically retro, of the same caliber we often associate with structures that aligned this national highway. Everything about this place is nostalgic, sweet, and distinctively American. The Frozen Custard is simply perfect! The taste is so rich, pure, and creamy. With a large variety of flavors to choose from you can't go wrong. The portions are very generous. The large size is more than enough, you'll see when you get there, but nonetheless, if you are new to St Louis, or visiting, please make this a stop on your tour. We made this a destination after visiting the Botanical Gardens and it definitely hit the spot. If you love ice cream, you GOTTA COME HERE!!",

  "text": "This was my second time eating Ethiopian food, so I definitely can't tell whether things are authentic. But what I can attest to is how pleased my taste buds were! \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the TA2, which is a large platter of pre-fixed 6 items, comprising of few different kinds of meat and veggies. We got the platter \"for one\" and thank goodness we did- the two of us struggled to finish it  (Be aware, the food is much more filling than it looks).  The goat was cooked well, and the beef was so tender and rich.  I loved the spices and unique flavors in each of the items.\n\nThe only negative thing I could think of was that the extra plates of injera were served at room temperature.  (At the place I first tried Ethiopian cuisine, they came out warm).  But it didn't ruin my experience since the food was so delicious anyways. \n\nOur waitress handled our large party like a champ and was willing to do separate checks. I know some people are a bit wary of eating only with your hands, so rest assured, they had hand sanitizers at every table!  The restaurant has a cozy ambiance, and with the Ethiopian decor and furnishings, you forget that you're in Indy.  It's a charming place, and I look forward to returning!",

  "text": "More than meets the eye, this restaurant is everything I could want in an Italian cafe. When you walk in there is a bar area (deceptive because it is small, but it has a chalkboard menu which immediately made me love it). We had a reservation for my friends birthday so a host walked us through an arch way to a dining area, which was bustling with people eating (and there was another smaller dining room in the back!) It is family run with a few family photos on display around the dining space. The atmosphere is welcoming and filled with the smell of delicious food.\n\n    Our waitress was very kind and attentive but not over bearing, always refilling our glasses and checking to make sure we enjoyed our dishes. We ordered calamari to start and it came out with a dijon horseradish sauce, perfectly breaded and fried calamari (very tender and amazingly tangy and sweet with some lemon sauce) over a bed of spinach which was a nice touch. \n\n     I then ordered the Linguine Dolano as a half order as my friends ordered the baked lasagna and the Cavatelli Broccoli. The half order was just the right size, still a decent portion and at a great price (mine was only $6). My dish was delightful; pasta tossed in olive oil with pine nuts, sun dried tomato with fresh garlic and basil. I was in pasta paradise. It was simple, refreshing, and extremely good. My friends loved their dishes as well and we were all members of the clean plate club. \n\n        When our waitress came back to ask if there would be dessert we couldn't turn it down--it was my friends birthday after all. Once she knew this, she created a \"sample platter\" especially for us, on the house. She brought us in house made tiramisu, a chocolate chip filled cannoli, and a dish of ice cream that was pretty amazing--everyone's favorite (possibly chocolate chip with some sort of sweet fig possibly) And all of their ice cream is from Serendipity's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/serendipity-homemade-ice-cream-st-louis) so I must say kudos for also promoting a fellow local business. \n\nMamma Mia! This was an extremely satisfying meal and first visit to this charming cafe.",

Donuts looked good and the local vibe of the shop was appealing. \n\nI ordered a variety of donuts.. And was disappointed to find that all of them lacked flavor. It was hard to tell which donut was a certain flavor because they all appeared bland and boring.

For quite some time, I have been hearing good things about this little cafe from a mass amount of fellow foodie friends and simply hadn't gotten around to trying it.  \nGhini's is a darling little cafe with quaint indoor seating and a large patio in front.  Since the weather was nice, we debated indoors or outdoors but eventually decided indoors. They have a phenomenal drink menu.  It is one of those menus that I have to narrow it down to 4-5 drinks and then decide. So many yummy coffee drinks on their menu!  I was in the mood for something refreshing and so I went with an Orangina.  Next trip, I will be trying the chocolate hazelnut mocha. \nLots of deliciousness is on their lunch menu and again comes the hard part of making a decision. MB has been to Ghini's on many occasions and raved about their Croque Madame.   Eventually, we both decided on soup and salad.  I had the  baby field greens, which were lovely and they had the perfect amount of dressing. We each had the French onion soup, which was so flavorful and pretty much perfection.  \nLa Baguette Bakery is inside and we made a quick stop there on our way out to admire all the pastries, breads, tarts and cookies!  MB bought chocolate croissants and I purchased a big sugar cookie loaded with sprinkles as a treat for my favorite kid.  He shared a bite with me and it may have been the BEST sugar cookie I've encountered.  \nI love it when you leave a restaurant feeling totally and completely blissed out by the experience, which is exactly how I left Ghini's.",

They are known for their brisket but personally I have found it to be a bit dry and do not care for it -- I would stick with their pulled pork and delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs.  I am a big fan of their sauce more so than other joints, and prefer their mac 'n' cheese over both Edley's and Peg Leg.  If you save room, the Pecan Pie is life-altering.  They also have a good local beer selection and ample parking.  \n\nDespite all the positive reviews, I've yet to try the nachos -- next time!\n\nPro-tip: There is no hostess so drop your name in the bucket when there is a wait!",

  "text": "Love this Starbucks. It's the closest to my home and it's a quick stop on my way to work. Bob, the guy on AM drive-thru, always has a kind word for me, and made the effort to know me by name. The drinks are almost always good, though I have had mistakes before. The staff here isn't as diligent after the busy morning hours, but no major complaints. A good tip for any Starbucks patron visiting even once a week is to sign up for their Rewards program. By paying with a pre-paid gift card that is registered on their site, members are treated to special offers, periodic freebies and more. It's really worth it if you frequent often.",

I fell in love with a $3100 sectional and I'm hoping one day ill be able to afford it. The staff are so friendly and there are tons of different fabrics available for the furniture they have in the store. Everything in 29 Armstrong seems mismatched but still perfectly in place. I love how chic but still elegant the pieces are in this store and if I could afford to do so I would finish my entire home with pieces from here. I was happy to see their new location is much larger than where they previously were on 104st. If you are looking to furnish a trendy space, this is the place to go!",

  "text": "Sabino Canyon is tops in my book.  Tops for everything- running, hiking, tours, nature talks, etc.\n\nA one-use day pass is $5 and an annual pass is $20 (so it pretty much pays for itself if you come here often enough).  The parking lot can get crowded on weekends, but stick it out!\n\nI love that on Saturdays, bikes aren't allowed at all (sorry cycling buds!) and on Sundays, no bikes are allowed past 9:30 am.  There are a LOT of pedestrians on the tram road during those hours and to be honest, the cyclists hardly ever let you know they're passing and it can make for a dangerous situation. \n\nThe tram road is a 7.4 out and back paved path, and absolutely beautiful.  I love running it in the early morning with the sun peeking over the mountains.  The scenery is stunning and you will be hard-pressed to find another wonderful attraction like this.\n\nThe trams start up around 9:30 and are diesel-powered 2-car trams,  one with a shade over it and one open.  These are a great way to see the canyon without hiking/running the whole thing.  Another idea is to take the tram in and then hike out or vice versa.  \n\nSabino Canyon is a Tucson staple. If you've never visited the desert before, this is definitely a great all-inclusive stop.  The visitor center has awesome activities and educational stuff for all ages.\n\nImportant tips:\n- Wear a hat!\n- Bring lots of water.  7 miles in shaded woods is different than 7 miles here!",

She carries GREAT and affordable accessories and I love the sunglasses she carries, so much so that I currently am rotating 3 pairs. \n\nLove that she supports other small business owners via trunks shows for various local jewelry, hat, purse makers.

Beautiful decor and happened to run into a few people I knew who happened to be dining at the same time, so I know it was a hot spot. I also had heard nothing but great things about the place, so I knew we were in for a treat. \n\nI ordered the skillet de la casa, made with chorizo, biscuits and gravy, cheese and over easy eggs. Also came with a side of potatoes. Everything was delicious... I almost wished it was a larger serving because I ate everything. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelette and enjoyed that as well. I was in the mood for a mojito, only to find out it was the best mojito I had ever had since Tao in Vegas. I'll definitely be back for more of those! \n\nGreat first impression.

Their unique flavor combinations leave me wide-mouthed and drooling every time I walk in, and knowing the ice cream isn't filled with potentially harmful hormones and chemicals keeps me coming back. I have been taking my son sometimes weekly for about eight months now and the staff has been friendly, courteous, and helpful every time I have gone. I love that they constantly have new flavor combinations frequently, and flavors that match the seasons and holidays. The first ice cream I tried was a strawberry balsamic. I still dream of the incredible flavor. I honestly tried it on a whim and it's been my favorite flavor ever since. I've also loved their Sangria sorbet, because who wouldn't like a cocktail in the form of a sweet frozen treat, and their Game Day (I think) ice cream; chocolate ice cream with pretzels, potato chips and a few other indulgent ingredients that melted together incredibly well. Other favorites included bourbon & bacon, Rocky Road, pumpkin pie, chocolate with chiles, and one of their regulars that has cake in it. I think I might need to stop by this weekend and see what's new.",

You got to choose 2 entree choices and a side plus salad. I upgraded the salad to the Lobster Bisque soup. It was a thick creamy soup and a little fishy. For my combo I chose the fried clam strips, garlic shrimp scampi, and the mashed potatoes. I loved the fried clam strips. The shrimp scampi had a decent garlic flavor but I felt it was a little greasy. The mashed potatoes had a good flavor and if they were hot would have been perfect.  My lunch date ordered the Asian glazed salmon. He loved it. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say the best thing going here is the Cheddar Bay Biscuits. They are a bit salty but really good. Service was decent. All in all it was a positive chain restaurant experience. If you're going to spend $50 on lunch I can think of a lot better places though.",

We were given the back room to ourselves where she kept the mimosas flowing. Very accommodating to my food and drink allergies as well. For breakfast I ordered an omelette with steak, cheddar and spinach, which came with home fried potatoes. They apparently ran out of tots but I was going for home fries so it didn't bother me. Everything was delicious and portioned huge. I couldn't finish. The Ginful Desire was a pleasantly refreshing cocktail. Raspberries, lime, basil, and ginger beer. Garnished with fresh raspberries and highly pulpy. Since I can't drink beer, the bartender recommended ginger syrup instead. I spent just under $20 on myself which is on my cheap side for brunch. I would love to eat here again thanks to Cadia's outstanding hospitality. Not to mention the women's restroom is an unexpected mermaid themed oasis!",

  "text": "I only knew about Southgate from a video about their brunch menu and how they make delicious korean fusion dishes. Typically I'm hesitant when trying korean fusion dishes as I often feel like the flavors aren't handled properly when trying to americanize or change traditional korean foods (or maybe I'm just a korean food snob? or both??) but I must say... I loved my experience at Southgate this past weekend! \n\nI started brunch off with their kimchi blood mary, which was spicy! I was actually very happy with the spice level but also how they use kimchi to elevate the bloody mary. I didn't think it was too overwhelming which was what I was embracing for. I enjoyed the spicy house-made soju shot that it was paired with as well. It was like a nice little cool down break from the kimchi Bloody Mary :)\n\nMy friends and I decided to do tapas style for brunch so we could taste as many things as possible. Best idea ever! We started with the kimchi deviled eggs which were tasty. Again, I am pleased that they were able to subtly infused the kimchi within the dish, which wasn't overwhelming or overbearing by any means. But it also wasn't just adding kimchi on top of a traditional deviled egg. I believe they blended the kimchi and some sesame oil in the egg mixture which really just made the mixture smooth with a hint of sweet and spicy. They had four pieces so it's easy to share.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the kimchi poutine, short rib and korean fried chicken (KFC) and green tea waffles. It is hard for me to choose one clear favorite, mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. The kimchi poutine was delicious and I loved that the fries and cheese on the stone bowl continued to cook and get crispy even at our table. They don't have any gravy on this dish (like traditional poutine), but it works out very well. Very easy to share. The KFC and green tea waffles were a huge surprise to me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the waffles that much, mostly because I wasn't too sure about green tea waffles... but it was very good! And paired with super crispy KFC was like icing on the cake. I wish the chicken was spicy though, that would have definitely put it over the top for me and been a favorite. Lastly, the short rib dish was good though it doesn't stick out as much as the other two. My friends really enjoyed the short rib itself, but I was under the impression it was suppose to be like galbi so that let me down a bit--still good but just not what I had been expecting. The short rib was placed in a huge bowl with rice, two eggs and jalapeños. The nice surprise was the sweet soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl, where the rice was soaking it up--it really brought the dish together.\n\nOverall, Southgate is a wonderful place to experiment with Korean fusion dishes. One of my friends had never had korean food before and really enjoyed our dining experience here. I like that they offer a variety of things outside what you'd expect. I will most definitely come back here for brunch the next time I'm in Center City! Especially for the spicy kimchi Bloody Mary :)",

We stopped in without reservations around 1pm and when my bf told the server we didn't have a reservation but it was his birthday, they did their best to accommodate us. Luckily, one of the tables didn't show up for their reservation so we got to stay! Our server was AWESOME. So eager to help and make recommendations, and super friendly. We decided on the watercress salad and cuttlefish, both of which were specials. We also got the lamb sausage and duck egg breakfast. The food was good, but we weren't OVERLY impressed by anything. We really enjoyed the lamb sausage dish, but felt that it was a bit small. The salad was good, but nothing special. I felt that the flavor of parsley somewhat overpowered the cuttlefish, but I also don't really like parsley so I may have been particularly sensitive. Given the incredible reviews, I'm wondering if we just didn't order all that well, especially because we LOVE Meditarranean food. The service was excellent...the server put a candle in our order of baklava without our even asking. I would definitely go back and try it again.",

Everyone playing the slots would love to see Lucky 7-7-7 for BIG MONEY!\n\nWhile I was in Tampa, I decided to check out the Seminole Hard Rock Casino. The new South Parking Garage had just opened when I was here. I didn't stay at the Hotel, so this review is based on the Casino.\n\nOh man! The floor was very busy and MOBBED with a sea of old folks, with most slot machines in this big casino being played. I felt very young, like I was walking through a huge and glitzy senior citizen recreation center. I think to myself: As a current working class taxpayer, I really hope those folks are financially stable and not gambling away their Social Security and Medicare checks. (sigh)\n\nThe Casino also has poker tables, Texas Hold Em tournaments, bars, nightclub, restaurants, food court, and the Hard Rock Retail Store. I saw the food here was on the pricey side and it's good that I ate lunch before stopping here. I did some shopping at the Retail Store and picked up some cool Hard Rock pins and t-shirts. This store does not accept the Hard Rock Cafe All Access Card (points program), but they gave me a 10 percent discount for showing the card. \n\nOverall, it's not Vegas, but it's a decent place to play the slots in the Tampa Bay area with very easy highway access to/from I-4.",

  "text": "A few years back Das Racist, a hip hop band, crafted a track about the beauty of being lost in a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. I've often pondered what Das Racist would've come up with had they called the bay area their hometown. I have no doubt that if they were tracking tunes in this area during the present tense, the song would incorporate the Blind Tiger Cafe and their combination coffee shop and clothing store. I'm not sure there is a better spot in town to get lost and spend a few minutes (hours) enjoying what's around you. The Blind Tiger Cafe is the first coffee shop in the bay area that I\"m completely enamored with. I love the product, the design of the space and the education opportunities the cafe offers.\n\nProduct wise, The Blind Tiger Cafe offers coffee, tea, baked goods, locally brewed kombucha, a Cafe Hey style oatmeal bar and locally made apparel. I've yet to purchase anything from the apparel side, although I see a t-shirt or two in my future. For now, I've spent my cash/bitcoin/credit card on the coffee and baked goods side of the store. My drink of choice has been, to date, the Cafe Mocha with almond milk. This drink blends just the right amount of almond milk and coffee. The coffee taste, which is normally a no no in my book, is one that I've actually come to desire. That's because The Blind Tiger Cafe uses really good coffee. A cup of coffee at The Blind Tiger Cafe is by no means cheap. Adding in almond milk and a tip brings the drink to six dollars or so. But, the drink is vegan and I enjoy the flavor, so I'm ok with treating myself every so often. On one of my visits I purchased my daughter a plain bagel which came toasted. It was served alongside grape jelly. The bagel was pretty big but other than that there wasn't anything that really stood out about it. I guess that's to be expected because people don't visit coffee shops for the bagels.  \n\nThe design of the Blind Tiger Cafe fits right in with the rest of Ybor. It has an industrial look, with its exposed pipes and brick walls. Speaking of the walls, they are covered with graffiti style decorations. One large mural shows the process that coffee goes through before it gets into your cup. It fits with some of the other murals that are featured on the walls around Ybor. \n\nOne of the unique things that The Blind Tiger Cafe offers is an educational opportunity in the form of a coffee class. This class shares some of the different types of brewing processes that the cafe uses and how those brews contribute to the taste of the coffee. I had a chance to participate in the class through a Yelp event and it was a completely fascinating class whether you were a coffee enthusiast (like some of the other Yelpers) or you just enjoy learning new things (that would be me). A Yelp check in to The Blind Tiger Cafe brings with it a coupon for money off of the class. Totally worth it if you have the time and money.",

My family and I can't decide which one is better because everyone in my family have a different favorite.  The only thing that could be better about the place is to liven up the courtyard a bit. Maybe add some more plants and some lights strung across for more ambiance.  Over all love this place.",

I physically had to remove myself from the store after filling a basket with about 15 books around $120.  I can't wait to go back.\n\nI am an avid book lover and this place is my Mecca! There were only 2 downsides:\n\n1) The used and new books were mixed together so you would find and awesome book only to realize it's $30 \n\n2) Some of the used books are grossly overpriced.  In my hometown in Pennsylvania you can buy beautiful antique books of all sorts from as far back as the 1700's for $7, while the ones from the 1940's at Haslam's were $30-$40!  It's ok I won't complain too much, they are the only store like it around and I am SO happy to have found it!\n\nCan't wait to go back!",

The longest wait I had from getting in line to getting my food was less than 10 minutes. \n\nThe best part of my night was the hookup from Uber for first time app users - up to $20 for a classy, comfortable ride back home.

  "text": "Ok. I hate this. I went here because we were able to get out of the rain here and get seats at a counter without reservations (a couple of other places were full, or reservation only) on New Year's Eve. It's loud, had college football on the TV'S and cheering patrons. I know, it's New Year's Eve....expect loud, obnoxious people. \nThat being said, our server, Tootie, was a sweet, polite professional. Obviously used to dealing with this type of environment.  \nI didn't expect much in the taste department, but I was TOTALLY wrong! \nTHE FOOD:\nWe started with an appetizer of Gator Traps. \nPanko-breaded alligator and jalapeno cheese stuffing, deep fried with sweet corn rounds. Came with 2 sauces.  The gator traps had great bite and flavor, and both sauces were above average. \nFor my entree, I got The Debris..Two burger patties smothered with roast beef debris, pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms on a brioche bun. Tater tots on the side. The Tater tots were fantastic,  but hey, deep fried potatoes in any form are fantastic! The Debris was a taste surprise to me. I took the top of the bun off so I didn't fill up on carbs so early in the evening (7 pm). The bottom of the bun was too soggy to pick up any way. I cut it up and ate it with a fork and knife. The roast beef debris was peppery and plentiful and tasty. The burgers were great, too. Apps and entree I give 5 stars for taste. \nThe girl who would be my girlfriend had the Buffalo Shrimp Salad. They were ok with a substitute buffalo chicken with the shrimp, and the girl loved it. She was really satisfied with it. \nOverall, food fantastic. \nThere was a glitch when a patron was throwing his arms around behind us and knocked a server carrying drinks into the girl who would be my girlfriend and got her a little wet. Not the servers fault. \nI'm going to give 4 stars overall.\nThe bill was kind of high for 2 cans of Miller Lite, 2 Chardonnay's, 2 entrees and an app ($75. Plus tip)\nThe men's room has 1 stall, and was only kinda clean.",

The hummus is also delicious with some toasted chic peas on top for texture. \n\nThe roast beef with cheese sauce is a grown up version of a childhood favorite of mine. Like I said - so sophisticated but still true to what the item is as a whole. It's a hearty sandwich that will fill you up! The burger is not to be missed either - it's got a little kick of spice thanks to some jalapeños. \n\nThe environment is lovely - perfect for a lunch meeting or date night. \n\nThe cocktails are inventive and potent.",

Great setup in this restaurant, I had a chance to eat in the back room where I could see throw a glass preparing the food, which I extremely enjoyed and made me want to be a chef for a moment at least. \n\nThen the food came out, mmmm. I went for lunch and I had a Pressed Sandwich of Whole Roast \"cochon de lait\". This is probably the best cochon de lait I ever had! It came with house-made fries, which I couldn't stop eating. They were addictive! Thankfully they weren't unlimited because I probably would have turned into a fries.\n\nI treated myself to a cocktail, The St.Charles Streetcar. It was St Germaine, Pear Vodka and Champagne. First off, no drink could go wrong with St. Germaine, but add in pear vodka and you have one of those situations that make you want to start singing Janet Jackson... or maybe that part is just me.\n\nTruly enjoyed myself here!

It did not disappoint. Their location reminded us of Portland, OR. I had the chicken slider -- it was okay, not out of this world. But, what is out-of-this-world are their donuts! We bought 3 to have champagne and donuts to ring in the new year and they were amazing. As we were walking out of the restaurant we were talking to the manager and he gave us 4 more for free (they had already closed)! \n\nOn NYE, we were able to cut the donuts into 6 slices (yes, they're THAT big), so everyone could try some of each. By far, the egg nog was our favorite... then the Chunky Monkey. The one's with no filling or icing were a little dryer, but still quite good. These aren't you're typical greasy donuts, they're fluffy and yummy.\n\nMy partner and his mom really loved their sliders (see photos) and we all LOVED their salad! I would go back to just have their salad and donuts. \n\nWe would recommend this place to anyone coming into town. It is a little pricey, but the food and how they work with charities is amazing. So, eat local!",

It comes with the cilantro lime rice, but I'm not a fan of that so I usually ask for double veggie instead.\nMy daughter is a fan of the classic rib plate with french fries.\nThe entire family loves the Texas Cheese fries. the fries are topped with cheese,  bacon, green onion and jalepenos. this is my favorite appetizer.\nAs for deserts, the cookie/icecream combo is very tasty. the cheesecake does taste a bit frozen, but it is a good size portion for sharing and the strawberry sauce is very tasty.\nThe service is good each time we visit.",

  "text": "Here's the absolute truth: I don't like ice cream very much. Gigs at two big ole ice cream chains really ruined my taste for the stuff, but I know a taste sensation when it smacks me in the taste buds. \n\nHere's the other truth: Everyone I've dated in the last 5 years is an absolute fiend for ice cream. I brought a date to Creole Creamery weeks after moving to New Orleans to try and cheer up my blue little love, and it worked. I was an instant hero. The case of just chocolate flavors (6 + chocolate in the hidden case) was a major selling point, especially because the chocolate flavors CHANGE. There is always something new and lovely to try in that case, which sold pretty much everyone ever. \n\nMy present love is all about the ice cream to the point that it's a separate food group. A visit to Creole Creamery was a little overwhelming (\"Suzanne, there are too many choices!\") but won me a fair amount of acclaim because everything that we tasted was fab. The mini samplers are really great because it's easy to get lost in all that ice cream if you don't have One True Love for each visit. Not too many other ice cream places in this world will do a sampler with just a few bites for the picky, indecisive, and expansive among us. \n\nMy favorites are usually Creole Cream Cheese (which is subtle so don't expect it to dazzle after eating three mini-scoops of super sugary peppermint or whatever), any sorbet that contains the word \"pear\" in the title, and the chocolate-orange flavor. (It seems to change names. That or I forget what it's called between each visit.) The pear thing seems odd, but this is true: the texture of the sorbet is the same as the texture of the flesh of a beautifully ripe pear. I am completely enchanted by that trick of sorbet making. \n\nYes, it's cash only. Yes, it's a PITA sometimes. But there is a charm to something so quaint. (Plus, being cash-only keeps me from dropping by more often for that pear sorbet. This is probably a good move.) \n\nAccessibility notes: door opens out. No Braille menu or signage. High counter. Can get loud at peak hours. Both restrooms are accessible for mobility devices.",

  "text": "My family chose Bluewater Grill to celebrate our parents' birthdays. My father and I love lighthouses and found ourselves gravitating to this restaurant despite its heavy tourist location. The food was delicious. We had the crab artichoke dip, mahi mahi tacos, grilled octopus with potatoes, crab Louie salad, and a lobster roll. Dani, our waitress was a doll! She was patient, clear and just lovely. I greatly appreciate her kindness and patience to my older parents. The crab artichoke dish was hot, bubbling and delicious. The seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked. Dani brought a birthday sundae for my parents to enjoy towards the end of the meal. Everyone who worked at Bluewater Grill was exceptionally polite, thoughtful and welcoming. I applaud all the great people working at Bluewater Grill and look forward to coming again!",

  "text": "Perfect balance of flavors, perfect amounts, and the prices are super fair for all the things you get (specially their special combination menu that comes with spring roll & fried shrimp and fried wontons as appetizers, cup of tom kha soup (exquisite), and steamed rice). \n\nThe pumpkin curry special combo was MILDLY spicy and sweet.  Very flavorful with a generous amount of meat (chicken in my case), pumpkin & veggie add-one. Highly recommend for those who are sensitive to spice but still want to enjoy it. \n\nSubstitute the steamed rice for coconut sticky rice (also amazing) for $1. I'd stick with the steamed rice to balance the pumpkin curry since the sticky rice is pretty sweet. \n\nThe pad see ew my boyfriend ordered was absolutely delicious. It can be too greasy in some Thai restaurants or over-salted but they hit the spot here. So savory with a very generous portion of meat (beef) mixed with thick noodles and fresh broccoli. \n\nTom kha soup was sweet with a hint of spice. Lots of chicken and mushroom as well. One of my favorite soups and I loved it even more here! \n\nEfficient, attentive, and friendly staff. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and well maintained.  Theres a lovely wooden patio with plenty of heaters as well. \n\nThere's street parking and public parking lot that's about a 6 minute walk from this Thai paradise.\n\nOne of my favorite Thai restaurants with just one visit. Everything was on point but even my words won't do it justice, definitely check it out !",

Very juicy, tasty, and tasted just like any other burger, not gamey or healthy like it might have. I also had the truffle fries, very gluttonous but very tasty and I would suggest sharing them...well maybe. Their homemade sauces were pretty special as well and were oh so good with the burger and fries.\n\nI would totally go back to try some of their other burger selections.",

Walking in, there's a birds eye view of various pastries, goodies and this day... this Saturday... the bloody mary bar!  I settled on the breakfast burrito w/potatoes for my meal and it was soooo good!  There aren't many places who do a good job with their breakfast burritos in terms of flavor, but this place is tops.  I'd have to say, this place will be my go-to spot for a breakfast burrito.  Now, potatoes being my favorite food, I wasn't overly thrilled with them.  They could have used about another 2 minutes in the skillet grill.  My friend and I felt comfortable here and actually spent several hours hanging out and talking.  The servers were friendly and weren't bothered by the amount of time we were there.  Matter of fact, we were there so long that happy hour kicked in and I ended up having 2 glasses of $3 house white wine!   Love it, love it!",

I visited SEE with my partner, with a glimmer of hope, after checking out its website.  Happily, I found many frames I liked, so much so that I had difficulty in making the final selection.  The staff was friendly....maybe a little too friendly and clingy.  We were hoping for a moment's solitude while I tried on frames, but an overly friendly attendant followed us around with commentary, a little awkward in the small space. My only other minor criticism is that I was not contacted when my glasses arrived and had to reach out on my own, so would suggest a different delivery mechanism.  Overall, I liked SEE's shop and customer service, but loved their frame selection.",

We had heard great things about it from other hotel guests and also my parents and my brother who had been on past trips.\n\nWe went for lunch because we wanted to make sure we would get a full rotation during daylight.  I think this place gets really busy just before sunset, but at lunchtime on a weekday it wasn't busy at all.  \n\nThe food we had was pretty good.  We got the caprese cocktail for an appetizer.  It was much more than two people could eat when expecting more food, but we enjoyed it.  For my main course I got the Italian panini, it was very good.  I forget what the hubby ordered, but it was some kind of seafood dish and I remember that he liked it.\n\nWe really loved the views you can see from up there.  And they have signs on every other pillar naming various cities and their distance from you.

  "text": "Finally, a Hai Street in University City! A perfect combination for those chipotle + sushi lovers! The ordering process is very similar to Chipotle. You can add your own ingredients into a wrap or if you're feeling like you'd rather eat with with utensils you can opt for a salad bowl. If it's your first time and you're not sure which ingredients will taste good together, I would recommend the signature items! Even with the signature items you can switch things up with your own preferences. I had the Slammin' Salmon which was filled with tataki salmon, gochujang sauce (a red chili and soybean korean sauce), romaine, cucumber, red cabbage, pickled jicama. This blend of the ingredients made for a delicious sushirito! \n\nThe service was friendly and fast as well! The interior was clean and modern with ample seating. For fast and delicious sushirito, this is a convenient place to grab your food and go. For convenient location, great food, decent prices, and innovative concept I give this location 5 stars. I would definitely come back to try The Crunch!",

  "text": "I've long admired the Hotel Mazarin for its picturesque courtyard because I'm often in the adjoining wine bar, the exquisite Patrick's Bar Vin. I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar. Plus it's just nicer all around than other FQ hotels in this price range.",

You can even get partially baked pizzas which can be super convenient.\n\nTheir crust falls somewhere between STL and NYC - soft but not too soft, with a bit of crunch. Not soggy (I will never understand why New Yorkers think pizza crusts should be soggy). Their crust is pretty good, but it never quite 100% does it for me.\n\nTLDR: solid pizza, good crust, real cheese, lots of choices, vegi friendly.",

  "text": "A parched dining experience....\n\nI used to live near Citrus Park years ago and always enjoyed the classic pub style food and casual Key West style ambiance. I was in the vicinity recently and decided to check Ballyhoo out again. I was really looking forward to the fish tacos that used to be one of my fav menu items in the past.. \n\nFrom reading previous reviews it seems that the management had changed hands, any my beloved fish tacos were a huge disappointment! I order the grilled fish version and although the portion was huge, I rather have quality over quantity. \n\nThe fish was horribly overcooked,and the tacos were dry. They did not serve any type of pico de gallo or salsa with it, nor was there any shredded cheese, a taco staple. Just bunch of lettuce, sparse tomatoes and dry, unseasoned rubbery fish.I asked for some salsa and lime and the server brought back one tiny little plastic cup of pico de gallo, and some dried up limes.. \n\nI like to smother my tacos with salsa. The server was friendly but very good at her disappearing act so unless I got up to find her, that was about all the salsa I was going to get! The tacos were accompanied by black beans and rice which were just dull, no seasoning.\n\nMy friend ordered a salad which looked like nothing special either. \n\nI did enjoy my cosmo martini though so a little buzz was nice to get through the mediocre meal. \n\nI'm rating Ballyhoo two stars because of the martini and because I didn't sample any other menu items and perhaps they do better at wings and burgers. But I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again...",

I can't speak for the service inside the restaurant, but I love sitting at the outside bar, and service has been spot on.\n\nIf you get there by 6 pm, there are a few happy hour specials; after 6 pm it's about $8 for a frozen strawberry margarita. We always order chips and salsa, and it comes out of the kitchen in minutes. Chips are fresh, and the salsa is decent, if uninspired.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the grilled avocado halves topped with ahi tuna.  So surprising that a dish of this caliber is on the regular menu - but it is, and it is delicious. Served with a side of boring rice, this is still the item to eat when you go here.\n\nThat being said, I tried the Southern Tacos last night: chicken strips, slaw, corn salsa, and avocado ranch with a bbq drizzle, served in two tortillas - and they were awesome!  So, now I am torn as to what to get next visit, but it's a good problem to have.  Shout out to the bartender for recommending the Mexican corn bread as my side item-it was outstanding, and heads and tails better than the rice.\n\nHablo Taco has surprised me by being way better than I expected, and I look forward to trying other items on their menu.",

I absolutely love really janky malls so you'd think Lafayette Square would be right up my alley, but apparently it's nicknamed \"Lafayette Scare\" for a reason. My personal safety trumps my love of dead malls. Because of this, I'm never down in this neck of the woods. As I drove by, there are a lot of empty strip centers showing the remnants of what probably was a thriving area of town in the 80s and 90s. Come to find that the reason why there are so many ethnic restaurants in the area is because rents are hella cheap.\n\nAnyway, if you know me, I'm not a big fan of pho. The taste just doesn't do it for me, and the portions are way too big for my bird-like stomach. So, the first time I went I got what I assumed was just going to be a tofu platter. What I got was a tofu platter... and about six pieces of rice paper on frisbees. I was not expecting that at all, but I really enjoyed making my own rolls!\n\nThe last two times I've been, I actually, unbeknownst to me, ordered the same thing (see my pictures below): #91 on the menu: Pork with egg rolls and vermicelli noodles. Protip: If you're not big on pho like me, opt for a vermicelli option. I practically licked the bowl clean.\n\nHidden gems like Saigon are my absolute favorite kind of places!",

The organization is easily figured out (though they have helpful maps at the front and in the back), it's much better than the corporate chain bookstore that was my other choice.  Although there are both new and used books, the used book selection is merely good, not great, I ended up with a new book on sale I had been meaning to read.  Interesting collection of collectible rare books.",

We had a group of 7: 5 of us are sushi lovers, 1 person said she did not like sushi and the other had never had sushi and was very skeptical.  By the end of the night, they both tried a little of everything and were making suggestions to eachother about what to try next.  The Imperial roll (or something close to that) has a great presentation: wrapped in foil shaped like a duck (we thought it looked more like a dragon), flaming and mouth watering good (once the flames go out). The martinis were delicious too!",

Lo mein here has become consistently greasy & has a lovely burnt flavor. It's so oily that I leave the last few mouthfuls so I don't have a heart attack on the spot. The food here overall is overpriced and crappy. The one thing I order [shrimp w/broccoli] is really hard to F up, but eating with other folks has shown me how hit or miss GC is. For some reason it always takes 10 light years to get the food when I order in store for sit-down service. That gives me homicidal thoughts that I can't shake for days.\n\nThis place isn't even trying anymore. They know they don't have to because an entire neighborhood that's flush with cash thinks GC is the only viable option for Chinese. See all the reviews post 2008? They ain't lyin.

I got some stuff from guitar center, but I felt better getting everything else from Corner Music.\n\nThe people who work here are top notch. They know their stuff. Take a guy there named Ray. Is he there to help me buy something, get a sale for the store? Sure, I guess that's part of the business, but he's better than that. Classic guy, very kind, and he's answered all sorts of questions about my equipment, the best use of it, what my priorities in getting together a home studio should be. It's certainly paid off. I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality of work I am doing, and I have Ray to thank for that.\n\nYes, I research equipment online. I find options. But Corner Music has personality. I love that.

Recently, my friend and I have enjoyed walking here. The sidewalk surrounding the park is a nice 1 mile walk. The park features tennis courts, handball courts, a large playground,  soccer and baseball fields and plenty of space to play, sit, relax or exercise. The interior path has a lovely water feature and small art sculptures that add to the beauty of nature. There is a concert series in the summer and the park is the sight of many local festivals like Grub n Groove and Art in the Park. It is also the home of Lanai Coffeehouse. Beautiful, old, brick, city homes border the park on each side. So no matter where you are in the space your view is charming and lovely.

It also came mixed w/ Brussels Sprouts, and a perfectly cooked egg. The sweet potato puree perfectly balanced out the saltiness of the corned beef. I already dream about going back! Maybe tomorrow?! Haha. My other friend ordered the Pork Belly Beni. Beni, as in eggs Benedict. It came on a decadent cheese biscuit. I tasted it, and loved it as well. We will definitely be back soon! \n\nService was friendly and helpful.  He was attentive, but not annoyingly so. My friend and I wanted to order some pastries to go, but were worried that they would sell out of the kind we wanted. Our server was nice enough to box up a croissant and coconut lime dossant (a.k.a. cronut) for us. Good thing he did, b/c when we left, we passed by the pastry counter, and they were sold out! :)",

It is a big enough place where if some machine or equipment is occupied, there are many other stations you could do while waiting for people to be done. There are many young men and women here (some of which I believe are VERY good looking; but you know, see see no touch -- dang it, right? Unless...) Anyway, I signed up for the group fitness classes here, too, for summer II and those classes are great. From Spinning and Zumba, to Core and Yoga; there is bound to be something for everyone. I really love the Anusara Inspired Yoga -- it's very soothing and it targets muscles which I never knew (well maybe Anatomy class grazed over it) existed and it stretches and wakens it. It is awesome to me. Most of the time, when I come in the afternoon/evening times, there are a lot of people so choose your time wisely. If you want a particular machine, come earlier when no one is awake yet. :D But overall, this is very convenient for students, faculty and other members! There are so many little kids here for camp and swimming; so adorable. \nAll in all, if you want a place to work out and you go to school here (if not, you can be an alumni or know someone who goes here to get a great deal [so I've heard]) then why not use it? You pay for it in your tuition ANYWAY! :D \nSee you guys around!",

Tough back bacon, overdone english muffins, the disconcerting perfect roundness of eggs poached in that certain pan, hollandaise sauce that was not present in sufficient amounts to taste, poor coffee, and nasty not fresh orange juice (in Florida no less) were too much bad to be redeemed by the pretty good potatoes.\n\nAdd in service that was neither friendly nor particularly good and you have an experience that I will not be repeating.",

The pricing is way too low given the quality..but that's great for us patrons!  \n\nBackspace Bar is open late and has a full kitchen until \"at least\" 4AM according to the bartender.  Cocktails are made from scratch from house-made syrups, fresh squeezed citrus, etc.  They're really affordable too!  A Pimm's Cup ran $5 or $6 at 1am, sans any sort of happy hour, and beers were ~$4, which were mostly local drafts.  \n\nFood...so good I ended up here twice.  The roast beef sandwich (The Whitman) is one of the best sandwiches I've tried anywhere.  Seriously.  The Meatloaf was also good, but I didn't love it as I'm still not sold on anything that has the words \"meat\" and \"loaf\" combined together.  The grown up grilled cheese was just okay, however.

  "text": "I love the pizza at New York Pizza, and I like the fact that you can order the pizza by the slice.  I had been missing that option for a while, as I'm very used to getting pizza by the slices back home, since I can't eat a whole pizza on my own, and I'm usually running off to do something.  Although it can be a wait sometimes, when you are ordering a whole pie, the pizza here is one of my favorites in the city.  It's also nice that I have a place to go for a super late night eat.\n\nBut aside from the pizza, since there are many reviews on the pizza.  I want to focus on the other dishes that are available now.  From thursday to sunday, New York Pizza offers an alternative menu for lunch and dinner.  The alternative menu features traditional Italian entrees (e.g., parmesan, marsala, pepperonata, piccante) your option of chicken or veal that comes with a salad, fresh made al dente pasta, and 2 slices of garlic and italian herb bread. The portion is large, usually 3 pounded pieces of chicken/veal, and you can easily share the dish with another person.  I highly recommend the parmesan and the marsala dishes, however, I did not like the piccante (capers are not really my thing), and I have yet to try the pepperonata.\n\nI cannot neglect some of the appetizers, you can order an AWESOME French onion soup, and yummy eggplant parmesan.\n\nI would like to say that I often think of the French onion soup at New York Pizza now, and it is the biggest draw for me to go there between thursday and sunday.  The onions, you can tell, have been slow cooked on a low heat and caramelized to perfection, and the broth (vegetable) is so flavorful.  The bread is tender in the savoury tasting broth, and there is a generous, but perfect amount of melted cheese on top.  When I was eating it, I was just having fun scooping up the soup, bread, onions, and twirling the hot melted cheese around my spoon.  Writing this is making me want to go get some right now.\n\nThe breading on the eggplant parmesan and the entree parmesan are the same, and I definitely love it.  Usually, I don't eat eggplant, but in this form, it was very good.  It was fresh, the breading was fresh and crisp, again with a mix of italian herbs, and it was not overly greasy, like you would find in other places.\n\nWhat is this that I've also heard recently and got to try?  The chef added chicken fingers for children that also comes with a salad, the breading is the same that is used for the parmesan, and let me say, it was fresh and delicious.  You could switch out some slices of chicken fingers for mozzarella sticks, whatever your kids, or maybe yourself would like.\n\nI think I'll hit up New York Pizza again some time this weekend. Whether for pizza or pasta, it's all good.",

This location is close to us and I am a sucker for coupons we get in the mail every so often..  Not that I'm giving lame remarks to cover my snobby food attitude but you can't beat their Mc Cafe drinks which are just like the fancy lattes you get at other nameless places which I won't mention.  The lattes are better and half the price.  I especially love the caramel latte with whipped cream.  I won't eat a burger here but the egg mc muffin is shamelessly yummy. The service is good and this location is always crowded. Kudos to Mickey D's.",

  "text": "I have finally found great seafood in \"da parish\". I don't live too far but I am not intimidated by a 10 to 15 minute car ride in search for my next great meal. As I entered the stored, I must say I did not get the typical corner store vibe. This place is extremely neat and clean. I was flabbergasted!!! Immediately I felt comfortable and wanted to try new things. The long line of customers that ended at she door was also a good indication that Son's Seafood was good. Behind the counter the owners children worked the counter. They were quick and courteous. The young lady allowed me to try a crawfish prior to purchase and I was blown away. I ordered a couple of pounds. I love crawfish but these are are awesome! They were fresh, hot and spicy. While at the counter I also ordered what I had even jonesing for all week. I ordered a small roast beef point with gravy and small French fry. The poboy was good but not great. I am saluting Son's Seafood and returning because of the crawfish. The service was polite and the store was clean. The table was clean and properly stocked. While eating my crawfish, the owner son kindly gave me a tray to eat my crawfish on and once I was done he retrieved it. I will be back soon to try more seafood. I spoke with many people as I ate my crawfish and they raved about their seafood. Son's is open everyday.",

  "text": "This gym is pretty decent.  It's small so just know that going into it.  I was used to PSC where there was a ton of different types of equipment so it took a week or so for me to adjust to a smaller gym.  The staff is very pleasant and is probably the best gym staff I have ever seen in my 15 years of being a gym rat.  The personal trainers actually look the part!  This isn't always the case at other gyms which has always been confusing to me.\n \nMy only complaint about the gym would be the use of the space on the upper floor.  It looks like they could fit more equipment (weight machines or free weights) on this floor.  Additionally, one room has a really nice set of circuit equipment in it and suspension training equipment in it but it is always occupied by the \"We Fit\" class.  It's a great class and I am sure the members who take it regularly love it but the class is given at 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm eliminating that entire room and all of its equipment during the busiest hours of the gym.  It doesn't make much sense to me to dedicate that room during those busy hours to a very small percentage of members working out.  The equipment in that room would relieve the wait times and overflow in the free weight room and the only other weight circuit.\n \nOverall the gym does the trick and I can get a good workout in.  Like I said, the staff is great which is sometimes hard to find in a gym.  I was told there would be a juice bar but there have been no signs of it yet.",

  "text": "These are the BEST CHURROS I have ever eaten in my liiiiiife. Perfectly deep fried, hot and piping with a side of delicious dulce de leche dipping sauce. I am so happy that I went for dessert after my meal- though next time I don't think I will be sharing!\nFor our mains my friend and I shared a half a chicken with the sides of roasted carrots, roasted cauliflower and potatoes (which came with the chicken). The chicken was phenomenal. I can't say any more than what all the other reviewers already have, but only to affirm that it really is that great. We both agreed that the cauliflower wasn't the best we had ever tasted, but the carrots and the potatoes were excellent sides. Between the two of us there was enough for leftovers for one which was great. It is definitely a place where you want to take more people so you can sample a bit of everything. I think that while the main course was great, I still think the home run for me was the dessert! Simple, yet so delicious. The atmosphere is really fitting- love the decorations and the warehouse look and feel of the place. It is very inviting and there is lots of different seating options depending on a) how many people are in your party or b) what kind of meal you are there for. Whether it be just drinks and an appy or a full family style meal. Such a great place and unique dining experience in YEG using lots of great local ingredients.",

I wasn't having any of that - I just wanted me some good burger. And I had one so I was happy as a clam. I can't even get my thoughts organized to rave about the burgers. My mouth is salivating right now - to the point of droolage. The burger is cooked to perfection(got med-well because I was second-doubting the grill-man...should have trusted him and gotten med-rare! next time...)and the cheese, mushrooms, tomato, pickles, lettuce... I scarfed it down within minus 3 minutes, I believe. My friends who were not (wo)man enough to get a beautiful burger got a little dessert thingy that they were still working on when I looked up from licking the last bit of burger juice on my plate.\n\nOH and they have raw oysters, too! I have unconditional love for places that has raw oysters. Done. I love you, Village Whiskey.\n\nHowever, I didn't care for the duck fat fries but it's just me because everyone else liked it very much. But that's because they didn't have the burger, I'm assuming. \n\nHonorable mention...the hostess that was working last Thursday night(Feb 10th or Feb 3rd - I can't possibly remember) - you greeted me ever so nicely and you took me right to my table so I didn't have any in depth conversation with you but you were the most pleasant hostess I've seen in a very long while..even working in that little vestibule with cold air leaking in from the front door, you had a genuine smile on and very welcoming.

I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.\nThe vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",

We had a great band when we were there and were able to grab a table right by the bar so all we had to do to place an order is turn around and say what we wanted - that made the experience even better (otherwise you would have to walk up to the bar to place your order).\n\nThe food is simply outstanding.  We had:\n\nSteak and Cake - Nicely cooked slices of steak coupled with a PERFECTLY prepared crab cake (just enough crisp on the outside).\n\nPork Belly - Excellent.  Served on little pancakes with some apple slices.  Just a great dish.\n\nFeta Fries - A must have.  Good fries, lots of feta, seriously you can't go wrong with this one.\n\nWe loved everything we ate here, and ran out of time before we could order desserts, I'm sure those would've been awesome as well.  The drinks here are nicely prepared as well and fairly creative as far as the combinations.\n\nJust a great, great place.  Absolutely LOVED it.",

I also discovered that I am a bit of a soccer fan after my first visit a fews years ago. I think it is nice that they carved out a niche and are sticking to it. All the wood walls and beautiful bar really make you feel like you are in an English Pub.\nThe little space set up out back for seating is nice on a warm day and you really don't feel like you are just sitting in a parking lot.\nThis place is not big and once people come they tend to stay. Plan on arriving early to get a table or seat at the bar, if not you could be waiting a bit. It is worth it. \nOne this to beware of is the bathroom situation, they have 2 unisex rooms, one in the front of the bar and one in the back.",

And you get to see how it's bottled (which is captivating BTW).  \n\nWe've gone twice with groups of friends visiting and loved each visit.  The guides are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly and seem to be very educated about the entire brew process.  My favorite part is the portion of the tour that takes you through the \"quality control lab\".  The guy that works the lab is hilarious.  You have to be I guess if you're job is to taste beer all day:)  Everything would probably be funny.\n\nThe free beer you get at the end isn't standard offerings either, we've had some experimental brews in the tasting room that aren't offered to the public.  \n\nThis is a Tampa, must-do.",

Very chill and very friendly and ready to blow us away with Fountain magic.\n\nMy husband started with the Dark and Sinister, but chocolate by itself isn't really his thing. So he ordered a second sundae - Three Coins in the Fountain - and he fell in love! If you want mint ice cream, this is definitely the way to go!\n\nI got Chocolate Brownie Cake in a Cup with Black Cherry ice cream instead of plain old vanilla. It was pretty big and pretty yummy. I can't say the brownie was anything special, but the Black Cherry ice cream and hot fudge made it all come together. Especially considering the huge chunks of actual cherries that I found bite after bite.\n\nI would say that this place has very similar sundaes to Crown Candy as far as serving size and quality are concerned. So if you want that kind of food, but want more of a dark romantic spot, this is the place for you!",

  "text": "I travel quite a bit for business and pleasure at various cities so I have a good idea of what to expect at various levels of hotels.  If this were an average priced hotel I would give it 5 star, but since it advertises itself as a luxury hotel and is quite expensive (I paid $260 per night with tax, and that was with my conference discount!), my expectations are understandably somewhat higher.  I will say I did very much enjoy my stay, but was it worth $260 per night for 4 nights? Not really. Also watch out for the $45 a night valet parking (what?!) and park down the street at 12th and sansom in a self-park garage for a much more reasonable rate ($18-25/24 hr).  The hotel is very conveniently located a block away from the convention center and reading terminal market, subway stations.\n\nSo the rooms are quite elegant and modern looking.  I love the sleek and elegant design, and the rooms on the upper floors have amazing views of the city.  It took me forever to find the keurig coffee maker but it was hidden in the cabinet under the TV.  I had a large king size bed and a large desk that could sit 2 people, and the bathroom was also quite spacious.  We did have free wi-fi which was nice (upto 3 devices at a limited speed).  The thermostat/temp control seemed to work pretty well.\n\nThe hotel does have a nice bar downstairs (Bank and Bourbon) which also serves drinks in the lobby area, which is a nice area to hang out, though the cocktails are a little pricey.  Sometimes the lobby has infused water, which is nice, but that was quite inconsistent.  The pool (a 2 lane lap pool) and fitness center facilities were quite nice, but the one day I made it down to the pool to swim laps, a few minutes later it was taken over by a hoard of small children who didn't understand the concept of a lane pool, and their parents provided them no direction in this, which was quite frustrating.  There were 2 lanes and no one was in the other lane so I would've been fine with them staying in that lane, although they were noisy and boisterous, but they were jumping in on both sides (jumping also wasn't permitted) and they were swimming all over both lanes and even walking on top of the lane dividing down the middle and blocking my path when I was trying to swim back and forth.  Their parents were just sitting in the chairs around the pool fully dressed and staring, but not directing their kids, which just added to the awkwardness.  But I felt like the hotel should have stepped in too and provided some direction about what the pool was meant for. \n\nI found the cleaning service a bit lacking for such a luxury hotel.  Spots of my room and the hallways were quite dusty, especially the bathroom and hallways outside (where I could see quite a few dustbunnies and a layer of dust!).  They also didn't fill the toiletries each day, although I used them. I usual like taking a sample home of the shampoo/conditioner at some of the nicer hotels since they provide high quality samples but they didn't provide more each day as most hotels do (I was there 4 days).  Also, the bathroom started out with a nice white fluffy mat that was very cozy to walk on.  Unfortunately I dropped a few drops of coffee on it the first morning.  I thought they might clean it, but instead they replaced it with a really thin crappy white mat that was fraying on the edges and it would slide around everywhere and not stay in place (not safe!).  I felt like they were punishing me for spilling something on the other one, which just seemed incredibly rude, but either way it was quite poor quality material for a luxury hotel. \n\nThen my last day I find that they left me all decaf coffee!! I call but no one comes for 15 min so I ask the maids outside if I can have some regular coffee.  They tell me they have been out of regular coffee for 2 days and can't give me any.  Seriously?! There's a 711 across the street, there is no excuse for being out of coffee.  I would've have gone to get some myself but I was still packing and getting dressed and ready to leave and check out and had limited time.  After a few call backs from the front desk we finally get it sorted out and someone brings me a few keurigs (I suppose they had some stashed somewhere after all).  Definitely not what I expect at a luxury hotel, but glad they finally fixed the problem after a half hour (not a pleasant half hour when you enjoy a coffee to get going in the morning).\n\nIn sum, this is a pretty nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay, but a few areas I felt were lacking to make it worth the luxury name and price.",

You really feel the warmth of the establishment. Also, Dizzy is named after the owner's, Wayne Baquet, grandchild. \n\nThe first thing I ate was the grilled biscuit. That biscuit was fantastic, I didn't think it could get any better. But guess what?! It did. I ordered the grits, eggs, and catfish with a side order of the fried chicken. THAT FRIED CHICKEN WAS SO DARN GOOD! It literally was the best fried chicken I've had. The skin was just the right amount of crispy and the seasoning was amazing. I love thick grits and Li'l Dizzy's grits was the perfect amount of thickness. \n\nThe owner, Wayne Baquet was very personable and kind.  Also, another staff person came to check in on us. I did not eat the buffet, but they do offer a buffet for $17.99. I didn't get it because I planned to eat later. The the buffet included gumbo, fried chicken. The sweet tea was the perfect level of sweet.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the catfish. It tasted like the river to me and my sister. However, we are city gals, so that review with a grain of salt.\n\nI will definitely be coming back and next time I will try the buffet!!",

  "text": "This is kind of an awkward thing to review but since I haven't really seen any reviews about it yet, I'll go ahead anyway. That's right, I'm talking about sugaring. TMI goes out the window after giving birth ;)\n\nI received a gift card to Sweet Momma while I was pregnant. While they offer a variety of spa services specifically geared towards pregnant women (I'm told the massage is heavenly), I opted to get my lady bits sugared since I had reached the stage where I couldn't groom myself anymore.\n\nI've never had anyone do any kind of, um, personal grooming on me before, so I asked the esthetician to walk me through every step. She was very thorough in explaining to me exactly how sugaring worked (apparently it is less painful than waxing because it doesn't take off any skin cells), what she would be doing (also asking me exactly how much hair removal I wanted), what I needed to do to prepare myself, and also how everything is sterilized and kept clean from one client to the next.\n\nI felt very at ease during my treatment and the pain was totally manageable (to be fair, I do have a high tolerance for pain). The esthetician did a great job and I was nice and smooth for a week before regrowth started coming in. I wish I'd heard about this technique earlier as it would have been nice to do before a beach vacation!\n\nThey also have a loyalty card where you get a stamp for every $35 you spend on sugaring. Your 5th stamp gets you 10% off, and 10 stamps get you a free sugaring session. The only thing I didn't love was that the room I was in was right next to the front desk, so I suspect that if you are screaming in pain, people would probably hear you. No biggie for me though. I don't know how popular sugaring is but I would definitely recommend coming here to do it!",

Good, fresh diner coffee, prompt refills.  Super mixed crowd, too.\n\nI've eaten at many \"greasy spoons\".  Where I come from, this is an affectionate term for a local place that serves breakfast at all hours and does it with more regard to patrons' love of butter & bacon than local sourcing or calorie counting.  It most definitely does NOT mean the place is greasy - I peeked and Biscuit's grease catcher on their grill is scrubbed so clean it would please Chef Ramsey.\n\nSadly, Biscuit's skillets/scrambles wear an egg frisbee. Scrambled eggs are cooked in an omelet-like shape instead of the fluffy bits I expected. It's not a traditional breakfast skillet - a \"hash\" of ingredients that can be tossed together (i.e. scrambled eggs, sausage crumbles, grilled ham or veggie cuts).  \n\nWe ordered some variety to find the gems.  We struggled to fit the massive plates on our 2-person table. Hubby enjoyed the biscuits and spicy pink gravy.  Pancakes are tasty, fluffy.  The breakfast sandwich, though, reminded me of hard times... the tiny sausage patty and fried egg only filled half my toast and I was left with empty bread.\n\nMaybe we should've tried the Breakfast Burrito...",

  "text": "Captain Just's is located directly across the street from Yuengling Brewery and with this place, you don't want to judge a book by it's cover. Make sure you check in on Foursquare so you can receive a free draft beer (I got a Yuengling of course). They have a daily happy hour from 11:00-8:00 and you can score draft beer for only $1.25. My two yuenglings cost less than Gabe's Coke. I love when that happens!\n\nCheck out the Oyster Menu! First the prices are amazing, only $8 for a dozen of classic oysters. Second, they have the largest selection of specialty Oysters I have ever seen. Cheeseburger Oysters? Philly Oysters? Dessert Oysters!?!? I had all intentions of ordering the Apple Crisp Oyster - I just couldn't bring myself to do so once I got there. I chickened  out.\n\nI started off with a dozen of the classic, lightly steamed. They were very good. I then went for a traditional specialty oyster. This girl couldn't cheeseburger oysters. I ordered the Oysters Rock - also known as Oysters Rockefeller. Half a dozen only sent me back $7. Amazing!\n\nWe also trieed Chicago Baked Oysters, which were Garlic Butter & Parmesan. Sounded greatly like Acme Oyster House charbroiled oysters. Half a dozen for only $6. \n\nThe oysters were amazing, the prices were very good. If you were looking for something other than oysters, they have a pretty decent menu with options for everyone. It was definitely worth the trip to that side of Tampa. I still can't get over the Apple Crisp Oysters and would love to know if anyone is daring enough to try them.",

It's really beautiful, and feels open and upscale. I love that they have a light menu as well, it encourages people to linger.\n\nThe only downside is that when you order a flight to sample what's on tap, they don't fill your flight glasses. They only have a couple of sips each, which is a bit disappointing. \n\nWhat they are producing is fantastic though. I'm smitten with the Gold Rush, and I'll be back to fill my growlers on a regular basis.",

  "text": "This food truck was in front of USF Health today and I decided to give them a try. I ordered the Miso Love Love with Chicken. The Miso Love Love is a creamy miso coconut sauce that is on top of your choice of chicken, pulled pork or pork belly. It was served over rice and had a side of asian greens. The asian greens looked to be chinese broccoli and was topped with a sesame paste-like sauce and sesame seeds. Surprisingly, this was my favorite part. I wish it came with more. The chicken was very flavorful also and the portion size was good. Total was $8 for the meal. There were a lot of great options and I feel like I played it safe today. I want to try the other, spicy sauces next time. \n\nI usually stay away from asian fusion food trucks because the food is usually not as authentic and portions are small. But Kind Grinds was an exception! As mentioned before, the portion size was just right and there was a lot of chicken. It tasted like something I would order at an asian restaurant. The people on the food truck were also very friendly and patient with me as I took a little longer deciding what to order. I saw on their Facebook that they will be opening a restaurant space soon in Seminole Heights. I might venture over there once they open.",

The fish is grilled, and tacos are soft and on a larger size tortilla than you usually find and the veggies are fresh and crunchy.  Chips are chips and I would have liked more salsa, but how can I complain?  $5 was including tax; what a steal!  I've gotten the taco plate before and unless you're a linebacker, it's way too much food for one.  This was just the right amount for my husband and I.  Wish they would open one in Arizona.",

  "text": "I love Macy's.. they have pretty much everything you could need to shop for. However we had a pretty awful experience at this Macy's on Saturday. First, I waited in a ridiculously long line just to get someone to grab some shoes for me to try on (there was one person working the whole busy area), and when he was my turn she looked at the shoes I was holding and impatiently went to the back and came out with half of them saying the others didn't have my size, and she was very unpleasant and rude about it. I think she noticed the shock in my face after how she spoke to me because she approached me afterward and was very helpful and chatty. Later, we went to buy some pajamas and the lady at the double sided counter ignored us and stood with her back facing us as we stood there waiting to make a purchase. When I asked, \"are we able to check out here?\" She said \"yes just let me finish what I'm doing.\" So we walked to the opposite side of the counter and she said \"I told you I could check you out. I did not say I would check you out on this side. You can go back to the other side\" in a very stern voice. I considered putting my items back and leaving the store if I hadn't wanted them so badly. I will be avoiding this Macy's in the future because of the employee experiences we had.",

There is ample cubby space for your belongings and a nice seating area (complete with a comfy couch) in the waiting area.  The studio itself is very calming, with lovely wood panels.  They have areas marked where your mat should go, which alleviates spacing issues and ensures that you aren't cramped like a sardine next to your neighbor, which honestly makes yoga less enjoyable for me.  So, bravo, Priya!\n\nThe classes are challenging, which I enjoy.  You will get sweaty, but you won't be dripping sweat and sliding all over creation.  I like that there are some 4:30 or 4:45 class time options during the week.  I do wish the studio had some natural light, which I think would enhance its beauty.

When we looked up hotels in the area, we saw that this place was dog friendly. The dogs love this place because there is the lake across the parking lot and at the end of the lake, there's a small grassy area where my dogs could go potty. It is really hard to find grassy areas near a hotel, in general.\n\nUpon arrival, I instantly thought that this was a motel (which was what we expected for the price we were paying). To my surprise, when we got to the room, the inside was pretty nice. We even had little shampoo and lotion bottles (which a normal motel does not provide). \n\nIf you're looking for a cheap, dog-friendly place in Reno, this is your best bet!",

  "text": "My first visit to this brewery/ restaurant and I'm close to being a fan. We were here to celebrate a friend's birthday and it seemed like all 12 or so of us were satisfied with our food and experience. \n\nIt is a large and open space, both dining room and bar area, with some outside seating available as well. If I were to revisit( a good chance I will) I'd probably opt for bar area, especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room. Trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch, the day of the event our 5:30 was changed to 5:00 by the restaurant. This was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7. We were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party. \n\nI first perused the beer offerings, there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans. I selected their blueberry Hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night, even though little to no berry taste came through. I would probably try something else next time. The food menu was possibly too large( in my opinion) with sandwich, pizza, apps and entrees offered. I was very hungry and 75% of the menu appealed to me, so I went to our excellent server Frank for his advice. He suggested a few dishes and I thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree. It proved to be good advice, a nicely cooked Frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fowl was tender and juicy still, the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed, it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened. The mashed were ok, and probably the weakest link in the dish. I had an add on Caesar salad that was fair and overpriced( as add ons go) at $6. Trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special, she loved it and I have to admit, they are sourcing quality crustaceans.\n\nMost others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things. Surprisingly no one else tried any beer. We brought our own bday cake and were not charged a plating fee. Beer aficionados should consider joining their reward program, for a $15 one time fee you are entitled to a special glass that holds 22 oz for the price of a pint, along with other perks and incentives. Great place for gatherings, let's go with 3.75 ongoing research Yelps",

I was disappointed that they do not offer sprinkles, only dipped or crunch toppings. An ice cream shop without sprinkles! What?! I was shocked when the cashier told me this.

  "text": "Absolutely positively the best Mediterranean restaurant in the Tampa Bay area.  This is a Jordanian restaurant with a wide mix of foods available. I enjoy coming here because the service is good and the staff are always attentive. It is also clean and comfortable.\n\nI always order a hot tea with mint when I come here.  They use tea bags but they are using tea that is popular in the middle east.  They will refill your tea cup with hot water if you ask.  I wish they would brew their own tea though and this would be a great thing.  \n\nMy favorite appetizer is the Foule.  It is puree of fava beans, some garbanzos spiced with garlic, jalapeno, lemon, olive oil and parsley.  It is served warm and with pita bread.  I love that this place gives enough bread and you do not have to ask for more.  If you are running low they ask you if you would like more.  Great customer service.  Another appetizer I like is Mesabaha a puree of chickpeas and humus with humus, jalapeno, olive oil, parsley and garlic.  The Babaganoush is also good and it has a nice smokey flavor. \n\nTheir lentil soup is well seasoned and you can taste the flavor of cumin \n\nI usually get a sandwich because it is a smaller portion than a whole plate of food since I get an appetizer as well when I come and otherwise I would not be able to eat all the food.  I would recommend the Kufta Kabob sandwich (seasoned ground lamb patties), Chicken Shawarma with their amazing garlic sauce.  My all time favorite is the Falafel sandwich with tahini sauce.  I love that the falafel is not cool when I get it and the inside is a nice yellow color.  The taste is the best falafel in the greater bay area.",

The entree for me this evening was the chicken thighs and boudin sausage over succotash.  I've had boudin in the past and didn't love it but this dish was fantastic.  The chicken was tender and tasted wonderful with the succotash.  The berry cobbler was a perfect summer dessert.  Everything was so delicious that we must return to experience great food.",

  "text": "TL, DR Brief:\nThe Alligator Meatball didn't taste like Gator, but still delicious, and the warm bread is divine at this elegant restaurant.\n\nI have time to read a review:\nIt was our last night in NOLA and we were walking around Bourbon St looking for a place for a good meal. We wanted crawfish and we stumbled into Desire. After walking in, we were amazed by the decor first and foremost. It looked like an old hotel with nice chandeliers and old school fittings. I was also glad that there was a television above the bar because I was really keen on keeping up on the NBA Finals Game 2 with the Miami Heat & San Antonio Spurs. Throughout our meal, it was fun to see the waitstaff get into the game and provide commentary.\n\nAfter perusing the menu, our order included 4 lbs of crawfish, crawfish carbonara, alligator meatball and oysters on the half shell. Some warm bread was brought to our table and not devouring all of it was a feat in itself! Our food came and I was able to try them all and loved it. The crawfish was spicy and a joy to eat, while the crawfish carbonara was smooth and very delicious to eat. The oysters were fresh and quite tasty, and the alligator wasn't as gamey as I envisioned it would be with marinara sauce that was a little sweet which I liked. All in all, it was an enjoyable experience on this Sunday night and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting as a place to eat on Bourbon St.",

The atmosphere was vibrant with open windows and, fun music playing through out. They had a fun selection of beers and brunch drinks ( belinis, bloody marys, etc). The table agreed that the food was great. The banger sandwhich and goat cheese omlet I split were so good. I sampled the burger which was delicious. The disco fries are a must! cheese, gravy, ham and a fried egg on top. This place defintiely loves it's eggs but that's ok with me:) Our waitress was awesome also. After working until the early hours the night before she was still pleasant and prompt. If I were you, I'd add Pub and kitchen to your brunch list for sure!",

We stayed in a room in the Gardenia building. The room was nice and was renovated but they definitely need to work on the exterior of the building as well as the hallways as these look pretty old and gives the hotel a motel feel. Otherwise, we loved our room and really enjoyed going to the bar patio and enjoying the sights and sounds while enjoying a drink.",

Tons and tons of produce, and the prices aren't bad for the quality you get.  I bought a pound of organic mixed greens for $5.99!  I found everything I needed very easily.  The store is the perfect size to accommodate all your needs but not be an overwhelming mess.  The meat and seafood are great quality and how can you complain when they offer 5 different kinds of salmon priced from $13.99 up (e.g., wild, organic, etc.).  There were a few deals so you can def try to save here and there but not skimp on quality.  I only tried a baguette from the bakery but it was delicious!",

Seriously, the BEST hummus. the cilantro hummus is what dreams are made of. \n\nI also love the staff here. They are so emo and cute. I kind of want to feed them all carbs to get fattened up in their skinny jeans, but it fits well with the hipster ambiance of the place. Love you Pita J! \n\nOH! They also have $4 and $5 glasses of wine from noon-4 and a reverse happy hour --- great selection of organic wines that are typically $11 a glass, you can't go wrong.",

  "text": "I've lived in the area for almost thirty years and this was my first time eating at Tortugas! Recommendation came from a friend who has been here. She knows I love Mexican Food so I was interested in it, I didn't think Tortugas could be as good as my fave, El Limon.\n\nStrike one, the hours on Yelp and on their sign said they were opened at 4:30- when we arrived, the lights were off and it was dark. I really was irritated with that. There is confusion with the info on the website versus the menu. The web says they offer drinks and cocktails etc, the menu says it's BYOB - ummm so which is it?! I asked the server and its BYOB, they offer one free margarita a certain day and time range but I honestly forget what the server told me. I don't drink, so I don't care. I do want other Yelpers to know about the drink situation- remember it's BYOB.\n\nThe server was a young lady with strawberry blonde hair, extremely friendly and attentive. They served us delicious chips and a side of luscious pico de gallo. It was fresh, with just the right amount of heat, diced onions and cilantro.  My order was three enchiladas one cheese, chicken and beef with rice, no beans. The rice was tender, moist and flavorful- no dried up peas and carrots either that seem to be the standard in Mexican Rice.  The chicken and steak were delicious and tender, it was shredding right from the fork.  I didn't detect much seasoning though in the meats. The cheese enchiladas was stuffed generously with cheese.  My friend ordered three cheese enchiladas w rice and beans.  \n\nThe delicious food and kind service made me forget about the restaurant being closed when I showed up. I would definitely come back again! This may very well replace El Limon as my fave! Can't wait to bring my family here soon.  I think the meals are a little more thank what you would expect but it's worth it- the quality is there!\n\nKeep up the great work, Tortugas!!",

  "text": "I've actually been to the Burger Bar before, but this was during my pre-Yelp days (and pre-meat eating days; yes, I was a vegetarian for seven long years!)\n\nSo I'm going to start a fresh review based on my most recent experience at the Burger Bar. \n\nMe and Andy visited the Burger Bar on a weekday night during restaurant week. It was completely EMPTY. We spotted one other couple there. That's it. Maybe that should have been the first sign?\n\nOur waiter was terrible. He seated us, handed us menus and grabbed us some water, and then all but disappeared for the next 20 minutes. What was he DOING? Like I said before, the restaurant wasn't super busy. \n\nBut that's not why he was terrible. No, he was terrible because he did the one thing that bad waiters always do: they turn into douchebags when you ask them for suggestions.\n\nLet me explain. The burger bar has tons of combinations that you can use to put together your own burger. You choose your bun, the burger itself, your cheeses, toppings, etc. Of course, they also have specialty burgers where everything is chosen for you. But who wants to do that when you can play chef for a night and make your own burger?\n\nOkay, so here comes the waiter douchebag part. We asked for some suggestions on what combinations are popular among other guests, and the waiter POINTS TO THE MENU and tells us that the pre-selected options are pretty good. Gee, thanks, hun...I know how to READ. Gah! Maybe I'm weird, but that just burned me up. \n\nBut anyway, the food. We ordered the trio of fries as an appetizer: zucchini fries, onion rings, and pickle fries. \n\nFor my entree, I made my own burger using a ciabatta bun, buffalo burger, pepperjack cheese, avocado, and jalapeno bacon. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium. \n\nWell, guess what? Our appetizer came out at the same time as our entree. Awesome. Don't you just love when that happens? Poor timing, folks. Poor timing. \n\nThe app was pretty terrible to boot. How can you go wrong with deep fried goodness? Well, let me tell you: I bit into the deep fried pickle, and the whole pickle slid out in the first bite, leaving me with a sad empty breading shell. Ew. Same thing happened with the zucchini fries. And the onion rings. I guess this was God's way of telling me not to eat things that are deep fried? It worked. I stopped after a bite of each. \n\nMy burger was also lame and sad. It wasn't cooked medium. Instead, it was well-done. *sigh* If a freaking BURGER BAR can't cook my burger right, I've lost hope for all burgers out there. Sorry. \n\nAside from the meat being overdone, it was dry and bland (probably due to being overcooked!). The toppings were decent, but they didn't add much to the burger. The ciabatta bun was hard and didn't seem fresh. \n\nAll in all, this was a complete disaster. Since our meal was comped, we felt obligated to leave a decent tip to our not-so-decent waiter. I'll tell you what -- leaving that $20 tip on the table was HARD. \n\nI'll never be back. Hubert Keller, you should be ashamed of yourself for this abomination.",

A bit pricey, but Grouper is - unless you are ordering grouper's playmate. Love their French Fries too.\n  I am a terrible creature of habit and the above is what I get EVERY TIME I go to Ballyhoo's and it is always outstanding.",

  "text": "After a failed attempt at a much busier and more popular restaurant nearby, we found the Tavern to be the perfect spot to start off our Nashville trip. \n\nThere was no wait on a Friday night around 11pm. We were starving and impatient for something satisfyingly unhealthy and delicious. \n\nThe two of us definitely over-ordered. After we received our beer and cider orders, we placed our gargantuan order for two: the Tuscan style Tavern fries, which was HUGE, the chips and guacamole and the fish and chips. Obviously, the healthy factor was not an issue.\n\nEverything was tasty, just in huge portions. The Tavern fries were easy to munch on, although there was way too much. We probably could have ordered this alone. But I guess if an order of fries cost $6.50, I wouldn't expect just a small tin.\n\nThe guacamole was interesting. The goat cheese gave it a different flavor - but I liked it. There were so many chips but at the same time, there was a lot of guac. \n\nThe fish and chips wasn't bad, not mind blowing either. It was so greasy I could only take several bites before calling it quits. I love when my fried fish is super tender and juicy, but this was a bit much. When each bite you take the grease seems to flow out into your mouth, it may be too much.\n\nOverall, a delicious late night meal for ones who were unable to wait 45 minutes for a table at 9:30pm elsewhere... I'd definitely come back here for a couple beers and an order of their Tavern fries.",

  "text": "Yes it's expensive, but that's what you have to expect from any healthy grocery store located in a city never the less. But to give Whole Foods some credit some of their prices beat the prices of Superfresh. Regardless you will wind up spending a lot on a little when you shop here. My suggestions are: \n\n- Shop for specialty items only that you cannot find in other grocery stores\n- Skip the produce, buy else where (unless you need your organic stuff) \n- I'm a huge fan of the bulk section- really cheap for oats, seeds, etc. nuts are pretty expensive. \n- If you're looking for a not so cheap quick, fresh, healthy meal come here. I love the salad bar (especially the tofu). More recently they added a grilled seasonal vegetable section which includes eggplant, portabellos, squash, zucchini, etc. it's so yummy! \n- They usually have pretty good deals on fresh fish and their poultry prices are average. \n\nOne huge complaint is that they have a small selection of fresh ground fresh nut butters (at least compared to the Plymouth Meeting location). The almond butter machine is always broken and has been gone for the past couple of months. I recently went in yesterday and it was to my surprise back up. \n\nIt gets super busy on the weekends and if you drive good luck finding parking in the lot. \n\nAll in all- don't make this your regular grocery store if you shop on a weekly basis, but good for some things you like to indulge in!",

Okay so really it is just the long community tables with benches that you can sit with complete strangers.  You can share fish stories with them, oh beer stories.   \n\nFood\n  Drinks - Started with Enjoy By IPA with the date of 04-20-2014 on tap.  This is a really hoppy beer which I love.  I noticed they had a Cast of Union Jack.  I was curious to try it but did not want a full beer and asked for a flight, which is about a fourth of a pint not really sure the exact size.  But large enough to give you a good taste.    \n\n  Appetizer - none.\n\n  My Main Course - Went and got a burrito from around the corner as the only veggie option was a veggie burger.  Never been a fan of those.\n\n  Dessert - none.\n\nService - They had one bartender working the bar.  She was helpful and friendly.  She even gave us our two flights (one for each of us) of the Union Jack cast beer for free.  She showed us the cast and explained how it worked.  The tap for that is on far left while the regular taps are on the right.  Which was really helpful as this seems to be new trend.  \n\nFuture - Signs up saying grab a beer and walk around while shopping.  I think the next time the wife takes me there I will have one to talk around.",

It's so awesome to see SLNPC doing well and growing with new menu items!\n\nThe second part of my review is to RAVE over the New York style crust.\n\nWhen the carpenter and I popped in there a few days ago we tried out our first NYC style pizza, which was a combo of the Rae Rae's Amazeballs Mozzarella cheese and the substantial toppings of the Downtowner. Which BTW, is one of the best reasons for pizza lovers to come to SLNPC..is that Big B tries to visit with all of his customers and finds out what they like, so each time you go back, you'll get the perfect zaa to fit your mood! \n\nBut anyway, the NYC crust is SO GOOD. It is the perfect inbetween if you're not feeling thin, and you're not feeling a lot of dough, (and to be honest, ladies, who isn't feelin a lot of dough these days!) it is baked just right with perfectly crispy edges and a well done bottom, all while being substantial enough to fill you up!\n \nPlus, for something new try out the olive oil sauce, it is SO GOOD with the pizza crust, I would be happy just eating that by itself!\n\nDid I just say well done bottom??",

  "text": "We had lunch here today and loved it.  We were seated on the patio.  The space heater was on, but it was unnecessary on such a lovely day, so I asked if it could be turned off and the obliging young man did.  The menu is extensive and enticing.  There are several breakfast offerings and several more for lunch.  It was difficult to decide and when I did make a choice I thought wistfully of roads not taken.  Though many things tempted me, I went w/ the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque.  Alan ordered the tri tip slider, a house made cheddar biscuit, scrambled egg, arugula, jalapeño jam, served w/ country hash.  He ordered coffee and I ordered Lady Earl Grey tea.\n\nThe tea was served in a French press-type device.  We had whole milk on the side for both coffee and tea.  My tea cup was tall, graceful white porcelain.  The contents of the press just filled it.  The tea was very tasty.  When our dishes arrived they looked beautiful.  My sandwich contained tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella, brie,\nparmesan rubbed bread, mint cashew pesto.  It was luscious and generous enough to share bites w/ Alan and still be too much for me to finish.  The tomato bisque was dark and subtly smokey, w/ occasional chunks of tomato.  It was my childhood comfort food grown up and elegant.  Alan gave me a taste of his biscuit and it was delicious.  He loved the dish, although he found the finely diced potatoes disappointingly bland, lacking onions, peppers or anything else to give them interest.  His expectations may have been raised by the term 'hash'.  We were taken enough w/ our lunches that we discussed returning tomorrow to explore more of the menu  Perhaps we will.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't full when we arrived shortly before 11:30, but a steady stream of people arrived in groups of two and larger and soon both indoor and outdoor tables were close to full.  Our server told us the restaurant had been open a little more than a year and that it was quite popular.  We could certainly see why.",

From my experience the items that are a little cheaper tend to be much tastier! I went with a big group after my graduation and the people in my party who ordered the specials and the bigger plates/entrees seemed not to be satisfied with their meal (i.e., someone ordered the steak and didn't love it, someone else ordered the fish special and was not thrilled)... but everyone who ordered the sandwiches/burgers really seemed to love it. All the drinks and cocktails were delicious. \n\nItems I really love: the bacon jam, and the brussels sprout! Also the burger and pulled pork sandwiches are delicious here! \n\nI was a little nervous because I had a large group and they dont take reservations! But I just called in ahead of time to check and they said they would work it out. I appreciated how accommodating they were! Everyone who works here is so friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the service is EXTREMELY slow and the wait staff seems super disorganized. For instance, one time I went there there were 3 different waiters who tried to serve us (even after we explained someone else was already helping us). \n\nIt is a good thing I didn't try this place out until I was about to move out of STL because it is a little pricey.

They also brought an extra plate without me asking (I hate when food comes out and you have to ask for a plate and wait there with the food sitting in front of you).  They are also really good about clearing away the used dishes on our table so they don't stack up. The wait for food was pretty quick and we paid a total of $22 before tip for a yummy dinner.

As it happens my dining friends weren't as excited as I, so I visited with a fellow ceviche eating friend for a \"day after\" dinner.\n\nFirst, small place with lots of personality and ambiance. We arrived around 7 and had the place nearly to ourselves (World Cup time, you know). The bartender/server was very accommodating when it came to the wine list and trying out different things.  The wine list is gargantuan, by the way. Thank goodness my friend knows wine better than I and was able to help me choose. \n\nWe were seated quickly.  Warm rolls came to the table first (with REAL butter!!). Our order of the ceviche pescado sampler arrived quickly along with yucca fries and chorizo y morcilla. \n\nCeviche was fresh and the \"Peruvian hot\" was perfect for us - not burn your face off hot, but nicely spiced with good flavor. While the yucca fries came with their own sauce, I preferred using the left over ceviche sauce.\n\nThe morcilla was pretty fantastic in my opinion.  I wasn't crazy about the chorizo, but it was good as well. \n\nDessert was an incredibly rich double chocolate cake. I mean, just wow. Since we were stuffed I rescued about half of it for tomorrow's breakfast!! \n\nAll in all, I really loved eating here. The food, the atmosphere, the people and service - all really made this dinner an enjoyable experience I hope to revisit soon. I absolutely will strong arm friends into going here for dinner in the near future (or I'll round up my ceviche eating partner in crime!).!",

Room service did a great job every morning and even replaced the shampoo conditioner bottles for me even though I did not finish the previous bottles.\n\nThere are two restaurants downstairs that are open late. Con Murphy's and asia on the parkway. I tried both of them during my stay and thoroughly enjoyed each one. Don't forget to use your room card because hotel guests get a discount. \n\nThe location was perfect for me to get around everywhere. Just a block away from suburban station and there are many bus stops around the area. Two taxi lines always available around the corner. It's right next to restaurant row so you have a huge variety of places to eat within walking distance. The museums are also right up the street. \n\nThe room itself was quite impressive. I had a full kitchen with stove, microwave, refrigerator, dish washer, keurig coffee maker.. Couldn't have asked for more. There was also a full walk in closet with hangers. Sleeping area had a VERY comfortable king sized bed, small dining table, office desk and tv. \n\nI will definitely be staying here again during my next trip to Philly!",

  "text": "When my visiting cousin wanted some good BBQ, I knew we'd have to give Edley's Bar-B-Que a try.  My coworkers had recommended it multiple times,  yet I'd still never been.  (Even if a restaurant has been around for a while, I like to review it when I go for the first time, in case my experience can add to the venue's track record.)\n\nThe ambiance at Edley's is very BBQ... paper towels on the tables, extra sauce, reclaimed wood everywhere, and the wonderful BBQ smell.  They also have a great bar area.\n\nYou order at the counter, then they bring the food out to you.  You can see the delicious desserts (like gooey butter cake and chess pie, oh my!) up there too, tempting you.  My cousin got the banana pudding as a side, and I was jealous.  But I had my hands full with my pork sandwich, cornbread, and macaroni and cheese.  The cornbread was good, and it had a little jalapeno kick to it.  I prefer plain cornbread, but still good.\n\nThe macaroni impressed me!  I love macaroni, but usually the sides at BBQ places are kind of bland and generic.  This macaroni was thoughtfully seasoned (I know that sounds so pretentious, but it's the only way I could describe it) and worth choosing.  I am lactose intolerant, so I have to take medication to eat mac 'n' cheese, and I'd deem this worth it!  The sandwich was top notch too.  I really thought the ratio of sauce to meat was perfect, and the bread was good too.\n\nDan got a half rack of ribs, as well as the brisket chili.  I got to taste both, and it was delicious!  There's great brisket meat and spices in that chili.  I'd recommend this option too, if you're into ribs.  My cousin got the ribs, mac, and banana pudding.  The sandwiches comes with two sides, but the ribs come with two sides and cornbread.  Bonus!\n\nWhen you're done with the meal, you toss the trash away and put your tray on the pile.  Edley's is definitely my new \"old\" favorite for BBQ in the Nashville area!",

Definitely try it if you're a fan of a little pep! Most recently I tried the \"Wooly Mammoth\" which contained dark chocolate, cardamom, cinnamon and blackberry. It was very delicious! \n\nThey always have two menu posters on the wall noting the seasonal drinks, both teas and coffee which they are currently offering as well as one poster with their signature house favorites. They are all uber creative and it's really hard each time I've visited to choose just one of the options with quirky names such as \"Walking Dead\" & \"007\".\n\nLucky Goat of course offers all of the standard coffee shop beverages, but honestly, that's not why you're going to want to come here. Stepping out of your comfort zone a bit here would be my advice. I love the feeling of coming in knowing I can try something new each and every time I visit, but can always go back to an old favorite if I so choose. \n\nThere's a couch and some outdoor seating which I where you can usually find me. There are barstool seats by the side windows as well as two tops in the main room. There's also an upstairs which is a tad more spacious. There's games for adults and books for kiddos. \n\nI haven't tasted any of the food, but I do go a few blocks out of my way just for those unique drinks alone when in Fairmount/Brewery section of the city. I say try it! Oh, and they have almond and other non dairy milk varieties for the fellow veg-heads out there!",

I was really surprised at how good it was.  Not that I was expecting something bad, but really, I thought that was the best latte I'd ever had.  I hardly needed to put any sugar in it (for example, at Starbucks, I usually put in 1.5 - 2 packets of sugar to wash away the bitterness).  \n\nAnyway, I won't pretend to be a coffee aficionado.  I'm not.  But I'll just say that, for what it's worth, I love La Colombe coffee.  And I come back regularly to buy their packs (Corsica blend) to brew at home in my french press.\n\nThe actual cafe is a nice place to study if you can tolerate the noise and/or have headphones.

They will not let you. \n\nThe employees all seem miserable. Even the manager has the \"Get out while you still can\" look.

However, I prefer my thin slices of meat rare and thin.  My noodles were a bit limp and I like my bean sprouts crisper.  I also would have loved me some more jalapeno, limes and Thai Basil.  Can't get enough of the Thai Basil.\n\nMy sister got her usual bowl and WOW that was amazing.  I would definately reccommend that.  Ban Cha Gio Tom Thit Nuong a lovely medley of Rice noodles, egg roll, grilled shrimp choice of pork or chicken served atop of lettuce, cucumbers, bean sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and served with a ddipping sauce (containing fish sauce I'm guessing).  Solid.  It's also called the #32 in case you are wondering.  This bowl is bursting with flavors.  My sister got the pork and it was tender and full of flavor.  Addiciting.\n\nThe 2 young men behind the counter were very sweet and lovely.  Although I'm more of a salty girl but when it comes to Vietnamese Coffee, I go all out.  Give me the 2 inches of condensed milk.   They go light here, maybe just looking out for you.\n\nYeah a bit pricey for a Vietnamese joint but I'd rather spend 10 bucks on a meal here then spend $7 at a drive thru.  Much better for you and go ahead and titilate your senses.  You can alwasy douse your pho with Siracha or Hoisin Sauce.",

  "text": "I'm really at a 3.75 stars here.....I've been here twice.  Once for a private baking event - for that I give it 5 stars.  And then I was here for a little coffee meeting....I give that like 2.5 - 3 stars.\n\nDuring the baking event, we had a group of about 12 and we were making babkas.  I wish I remembered the chef's name because he was fun and fantastic.  We learned how to roll out the dough, a little help from the fancy rolling machine and how to knead it properly, how to load it up with filling, how to cut and fold it and then they baked them for us.  They turned out lovely and delicious.  For storage purposes, they also told us how to package them so we could keep them for Thanksgiving 4-5 days later and mine kept perfectly!  My family enjoyed it!\n\nThe event itself was fun and doing the work and baking was fun.  We even got to help with the next day's croissants - rolling them...  They laid out some nice snacks and drinks for us after the baking was done so we could chat with one another until the baking was complete.  Very nice small baking event for a very reasonable price.  That was 5 stars!\n\nOn a separate occasion I met a friend for coffee and had a breakfast sandwich.  I was happy that they could accommodate my need for non-dairy in my special drink and the croissant with egg and bacon was nice...however, I could not taste the caramel in my caramel macchiato...I went up to request more and she loaded it in there and I took a seat and again, still could not taste the caramel.  The coffee did not taste nice.  I was VERY sad about that.  My croissant was very large (update to include that this large croissant was not a negative thing!  I liked that it was large), the egg was decent and bacon was thick...but a lot of fat.  I peeled off a lot of fat from the 2 slices and left it on the side of the plate.  You're going to get fat on bacon, yes, but it was kind of a lot of fat...  And the flavor was plain.\n\nI think this place is a bit over-rated, as much as I enjoyed the baking class...but the baked goods are very good.  It's just not a great place for coffee or to eat here unless you are having one of their baked goods.",

Ive had so much fun in this tiny little joint at the end of the pier, a place offering fresh steaming seafood without a care as to who the hell you are or where you come from. They work fast and hard and I was amazed at how much food was prepped and pushed in front of avid, eager and hungry patrons of all walks.\n\nFarm raised abalones tasted wonderful fried quickly in butter and wine and served on a bed of rice with tomatos and basil with fresh sourdough. Mouth-watering delectables,  these abalone guys support a cottage industry from the greedy ab diving pigs and asses who don't obey conservation rules or countries with no rules whatsoever. Only $17.95 gets you one of the finest delicasies from the sea. And the clam chowder is excellent.\n\nWe went back on our last day for more abs and the dungeness crabs and I felt wonderful flinging bits of crab everywhere, my care gone with the wind, and I was a mess though Jon still thought I looked killer in crabmeat. I was in shellfish heaven and I get a little crazy sometimes snapping off arms of tasty white meat.",

  "text": "Very impressed with this place and surprised I haven't heard more buzz about it. Everything I had was great and my whole party of six loved every single course, from drinks and appetizers to dessert.\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived first so we waited at the bar. The bartender was friendly and accommodating and didn't mind transferring the check to our table when everyone else arrived. The oyster appetizer was delicious; the portion of four is perfect for sharing. They were rich and flavorful. Yum. For my main course I had the steak frites, which I figured was a safe bet but I was jonesing for some red meat. I usually get the fillet but they served a strip and I had no complaints about it at all. The fries were crispy and awesome. Everyone else loved what they got too -- the snapper was apparently very good but had a strong coconut flavor, so watch out if that's not your thing (like me). The only complaint we had was that my uncle said the scallops weren't hot. They were just room temperature so he sent them back to get them warmed up. I'm pretty sure they gave him a whole new order since it took a few minutes to come back to the table. \n\nThe service was also excellent as our waiter took care of all of our needs but wasn't overbearing or intrusive. I can't comment on the price, really, as I was treated to this meal. Entrees range from the mid $20s to $34, which was the highest price I saw on the menu. Shockingly, it was for a burger! But it did have foie gras on it, so I guess that's why it was so pricey. This is definitely a special occasion kind of place but I hope to be back again soon.",

  "text": "I ventured away from my hotel in search of a casual dinner and local brew on my first night in Indy.  Unfortunately, I did not check the game schedule and wandered right into Pacers mayhem.  After finding that my original choice was pack to bursting, I found Pearl Street Pizzeria and boy am I glad I did! \n\nIt was pretty full when I came in but it cleared out a few minutes before game time.  I was treated to lovely, personal service that I couldn't believe.  When I put a few bucks into the jukebox right before it switched off, they actually gave me my $5 back.  I don't think that's ever happened to me before. \n\nThe local beer selection was well rounded and the staff all seemed to have a pretty decent knowledge of the varieties on tap.  I had the honey mustard chicken pizza at the suggestion of my waitress.  It was kind of life-changing, you guys.  Like, mustard on a pizza?  This could be the new \"put an egg on it.\"  \n\nBottom line: You treated me very well in a very unfamiliar city, Pearl Street.  If I ever make it back to Indy, I'll be stopping by.  And I'll be bragging about your pizza to everyone in the meantime.",

I have since cancelled my membership due to leaving for work nowadays at 530 am leaves me little time to actually go but I am hoping one of these days my work schedule changes and I can start going again. My favorite part would have to be the large amount of cardio equipment that was usually readily available and the usual staff I encountered was always incredibly friendly. When I made the decision that I needed to cancel I was a little nervous because I am insanely non confrontational but the process was smoother than I could have asked for. Within an hour of sending my email through the website I had an email back from the manager and I really respect that. I would have to say the only thing I wish was different about the place would be the hours. I have a long commute and having them open earlier (or later) would be very beneficial.",

Honestly, yes I do, but the reasonable person in me says, \"no.\" So, instead I decided to get a latte and the boy went for a combo of the gelato-espresso special. \n\nYou have won over that last star, Capogiro. That was a perfect latte and that espresso gelato thing was like fireworks in your mouth. It was the dark chocolate gelato with hot espresso poured over it and it was served with whipped cream (not the fake canned stuff, either!)\n\nIt was incredible and reasonably priced, too, which I found surprising. \nOne word: Ambrosia. \n\nI would also like to add that their happy hour specials and beers on tap are also reasonably priced and they offer a decent selection. \n\nThanks and much love, \nAddicted",

That was my first time to Village Pub, but it hasn't been (and certainly won't be) the last. Some bars are expertly designed and equipped to accommodate laughter, music, fun, etc. Village Pub goes for a different motif: home. There is perhaps no other place I feel relaxed to sit around drinking outside the confines of my own property.\n\nAside from the relaxation, the mules are another great reason to come here. The gin-based version is fun to order (\"The English Ass\") and equally fun to drink. I can't immediately think of a more refreshing alcoholic beverage. The beer selection is also superb.\n\nOne final note: I played two games of chess with my friend when I was in here. The pre-drinks game went well for me. The post-drinks game did not.

  "text": "So today was a day where my wife wanted to try something different and new. Cool, why not I mean new is always good right!! But in this case it was WRONG!! In so many ways.\n\nWe were out and driving down Dale Mabry and she said let's go into this shopping area. We were surrounded by different options and she saw [Jazz] open for breakfast, New Orleans style food so she was sold!! When you walk in you can see the potential in it, though the decor was to dark especially during the day you could see the vision they had for when it was a Jazz night. \n\nThe Hostess Petal was 1 of 2 things that were right for our visit here. The 2nd was the 2 for 1 Mimosas she made, OMG!!! Not shy with the champagne just the way a Mimosa should be. So we were like okay we might be okay here. Once the food arrived it was straight downhill and what's so bad about it is you want to root for this place. Every thing that came out you can tell there is no love being put into these dishes. Every last one looked like something you can make at home and even better looking as well.\n\nMy wife had the chicken and waffles, lil man had pancake [1] and eggs and I had the Tace classic egg Benedict which came with / thinly sliced ham, two poached eggs, topped w/ Louisiana hot sauce Hollandaise. Choice of fresh fruit, grits or brabant potato. When the plate arrived no ham [for it wasn't thawed] So they replaced it with bacon. I wasn't asked if I wanted grits or fruit they just decided for me and did put what suppose to be a fancier named for home fries [Brabant potato].\n\nThe food was something a guy might try to make to impress his girlfriend that spend the night. I do believe a real CHEF is needed and not that average Joe they have back there cooking. Because nothing is New Orleans about their food. I can see why this place is empty and Starbucks is winning. Goes to show you people would rather have microwave food then this establishment food. Next time if we decide to come again will be for Petals 2 for 1 Mimosas she made us cause this was the only thing worth paying for.",

  "text": "We were taken here yet again last night.  Our English Mastiff was 12 years old, and for the last few months we have been discussing what to do with her when she passed.  I looked up pet cremation and it didn't seem that there were any in Tucson that would take a dog of her size.  We can't exactly flush a 150 pound dog down the toilet, and not even a little part of me wanted to dig a hole that size.  We decided we didn't know what we would do, but that we would just decide when the time came.\n\nThe time came last night.  We went outside to call our two dogs in for the night and only one came to the door.  We walked into the yard and found our poor Mastiff's body.  We called a friend to come over at 2 am to help us dig, when my husband had the brilliant idea to call this place and see if they could do anything with her remains for us.\n\nWe called, and before we gave our names or the dog's name, we explained that she had been there before.  The person on the other end said \"Oh, I remember you!  Is this Tawny's dad?\"  This person actually remembered our dog from when she was there months ago.  She told us they could cremate her and either keep or return the ashes to us, and to just drive around the back with her when we arrived.  The price for our ginormous dog to be cremated and have her ashes returned to us was $165.  This was much less than I was expecting to pay, based on my previous searches for this service and her size.\n\nBy this time my friend had arrived ready to dig, but instead the three of us wrapped her in a blanket, loaded her into the truck and drove over.  When we walked in, she asked about our cat and remembered his name also.  She commented on how good Tawny had looked last time she saw her, that she was a really good dog and how sad she was that Tawny had passed.  She also asked us if we wanted a clay imprint of Tawny's paw, free of charge, so we could have a little reminder of her.\n\nShe met us out back with a gurney and another blanket for her, she climbed into the bed of our truck to load her up, and very respectfully moved her and took her away.  There was no banging the dog around, and she did everything as gently as she could, considering the dog probably weighed more than she does. \n\nSouthern Arizona Veterinary Specialty and Emergency Center has never stopped being a five star experience for me.  From the staff to the pricing to their willingness to help to the amount of turmoil they have helped our family avoid, I can honestly say these are great people who genuinely love animals and want to do everything they can for them.  I am so happy that I found this 24 hour clinic.",

Its like dirty foreplay talk to me.\n\nSo when my weekend plans got cancelled at the very last minute and I heard that we were going to Santa Barbara instead I got understandably excited! Oh, the mission! *Squeal*! What I wasn't aware of, though, was the fact that Santa Barbara has a presidio! Being from San Diego, Im well aware of presidios and missions. We have the first ones in California. But unlike San Diego, Santa Barbara actually has a presidio. It may be fake and reconstructed, but its there, and right in downtown SB nonetheless! It was the first established settlement in the town. Since this is the case, the actual area of the presidio is stretched over 4 blocks. like right in the middle of an intersection. \n\nWhats really cool about this place is that they have reconstructed rooms and signs that tell you of the uses. It may be small, but you can actually see what the presidio was used for. They even have gardens with vegetables and crops growing! It was really cool stopping by after lunch and doing a quick tour of history. No one was there so it felt like I had the whole place to myself. I didnt go into the church area because there was a wedding going on, but it looked interesting from the outside.\n\nThis is a nice interesting place to stop for a quick attraction. Theres plenty to do in the area as it is right in the middle of town.",

Although, I will say that the bacon bits in my salad seemed more fresh on Sunday morning than they did on Friday night.

The DJ booth was dialed in as was the guy on the mixing board.  It's a great feeling as a performer to just be able to show up and perform, not having to worry whether a sound check was even done, whether everything is hooked up properly, and know that the promoter is passionate about his brand or club night.\n\nThe crowd is a mix of young and older (leaning toward young) and the bar staff and security were both very cool.  Add a splash of professional go-go dancers and concert lighting and you've got a solid club experience.\n\nIf you're a fan of house, techno, etc. and are looking for a club night to get wild at, I strongly suggest you check out TheKnit on Saturday nights for 'Late Night Love'.",

The drinks on bored are a bit pricy and you have to be careful about how much you spend on them because you don't use cash you can spend way more then you think or want.  There is a way around this though.  Each person is allowed to bring on two bottles of wine in there carry on bags.  Also each person can bring on a case of pop or water.

  "text": "Absolutely beyond the 'woohoo! as good as it gets!' 5 Yelp stars!  \n\nZeppoli blew me away with every course from start to finish!    Hands down - BEST MEAL OF THE YEAR 2016!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is small/intimate and no big deal of a decor; however, I loved all of their fresh plants and black & white photos of Italy.  \n\nBread - two varieties of each (3) with an incredible seasoned olive oil (comes w/ three olives).  \n\nWe shared two appetizers - a shrimp and bean one (three large and totally taste galore shrimp!) and an incredible pesto pasta one.  The sauces on each were insanely delcious!  Even the pasta itself was devine & that's my 'area of expertise!'  \n\nI had a hard time choosing from the (small) menu b/c I do not eat (nor have ever tried, nor want to) rabbit, wasn't in the mood for chicken, was still teetering about the branzino and wasn't interested in the other menu items for differing reasons.\n\nI did decide on the 'Fisherman's Stew.'  GREAT choice!!!!  It was absolutely AMAZING.  Clams, mussels, swordfish, shrimp and calamari in a broth that I made sure to get every possible lick of w/ my large spoon!  It also boasted really good cous cous (a touch more would've been nice).  Everything was cooked perfectly.  I cannot say enough about the broth!!   W  O  W  !!!!\n\nVince had a wonderfully delcious 'slab' of swordfish accompanied by an orange fennel salad (not up my alley) that he enjoyed tremendously.\n\nWe finished w/ a fabulously delectible dessert - pistachio and walnut semifreddo.  I have NEVER had a dessert such as this one before.  Every bite was absolutely luscious!  \n\nThey even put a sparkler atop for Vince's birthday!\n\nI did not want this night or meal to end!  \n\nI will & would reccommend 'Zeppoli' to everyone, especially those who are looking to impess someone for a special occasion. \n\n TO DIE FOR!",

Everything about it conjures images of Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop; delicate, pink, princessy. Absolutely adorable. Secondly, the displays of baked goods is astonishing. Everything looks perfect, yet edible and delicious. Lastly, service is so friendly! Love all around. Can't wait to go back and try their champagne cocktails. \n\nPro-tip: they have a small parking lot, use it! Also, cake slices are HUGE! Buy one to share. Lastly, service is great, but comes with a bit of a wait. Build in extra time for your stop!",

I've been to many yoga studios and one thing I can't stand is the moldy, gym-sock smell that lurks in some of Philly's studios.  \n\nYoga Garden sounds just like its name - fresh and clean.  The studio space is quite large and they keep extra mats and blocks nicely organized in the rear of the room.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable too!\n\nI really like the sunrise vinyasa classes at 7am, but I wish they held them every day of the week (excluding weekends, of course).  Right now, they are only offered Tues/Thurs.  If you're on a budget like I am, the early morning or lunch hour classes are affordable ($8).  They do offer a week of free yoga, so you really have no excuses not to try it out, do you?",

  "text": "Stopped by before the Blues game last night. There was a 30 minute wait but I think it was quicker. It was definitely hopping. Our waiter took our order right away because we wanted to go quickly so we could get to the game. \n\nI started with a rosemary white peach boozy lemonade. It was delicious! Good sized and perfectly flavored. They have lots of variations of fruity boozy drinks, which I love. It was hard to decide what to get. My dining partners each got something different, and each liked theirs. \n\nFor my meal, I knew I had to try the veggie burger, which has changed since my last (dismal) review. Now it is described as \"sweet potato patty, pecan butter, sage aioli, spinach.\" I wasn't so sure about the toppings but got it as is because I wanted to try how they had hopefully improved the flavors since last time. My husband and I also ordered a large order of fries with sriracha catsup and cheddar sauce. \n\nOur drinks took awhile to come but the food was quick. And.... REDEMPTION!!!! This veggie burger was DELICIOUS. SO MUCH BETTER than it used to be! The flavors of the aioli and pecan butter were perfect with the earthy flavor of the burger. The bun was so soft and fresh. Just wonderful. I ate it all up. The fries here are really good, and the sauces also were. They bring bigger portions than they did the last time I went. The total bill for 2 drinks, 2 burgers and a large fry was about $40 without tip. A little pricey, but good for the quality and location.\n\nThe only bad thing was that one of my dining partners got a burger that was still mooing, but he sent it back and it was redone and brought back quickly. The others enjoyed theirs. I liked mine so much that I really want to come back soon to get another!",

  "text": "I'll preface with the \"there's no shame in getting three stars\" caveat. I had brunch at Home Wine Kitchen this morning and it was A-OK. Not knock-your-socks off good, but not bad either. \n\nWe went after noon, so there was no trouble finding a seat. We opted for a high-top table, and I thought it was plenty comfortable. \n\nMy friend wanted a Bloody Mary, but nothing too spicy. They only serve their house mix, which our server warned would probably be on the peppier side. Grateful for the warning, my friend asked if they served fresh-squeezed orange juice. No. But they are working on it, so that's nice to know. \n\nIt would be nice if the brunch menu listed out some more beverage options than just the mimosa or bloody mary. Do you have lattes or just coffee? Juice? Sodas? \n\nFor a starter, we had the cinnamon bread. The topping was lovely and had a great flavor, but the bread itself was just ok. For entrees, I had the eggs benedict and my friend went with the steak and eggs. \n\nThe eggs benedict: 3.5 stars. The eggs were poached perfectly. I liked the crispy spinach and the buttered ciabatta or whatever toasty bread they put everything on. It came with a deceptive amount of prosciutto. I really liked it, but at the end I had a big pile of it left over. I was not a fan of the brown butter hollandaise. It didn't look appealing the way it was squirted on the dish and I wasn't crazy about the flavor. There was something spicy that kind of turned me off. But on the whole -- it is a solid dish. \n\nI can't comment on the steak and eggs, as I only tried a little piece of the carpaccio. My friend enjoyed it. \n\nI felt the portions were generous for the price. The service was excellent. My coffee and water were always full. Also, those little clear jars for the sugar are a nice touch. \n\nAll that said, I don't think this is somewhere I would think to come back to when I'm craving brunch. Everything was fine and good, but nothing really stood out to be crave-worthy. \n\nI'm going to give them a try for dinner, which is where I'm sure their biggest strengths lie.",

  "text": "My boyfriend and I just moved to Tampa and are really enjoying our new home just off Bayshore Blvd but seeing all of the happy looking bikers enjoying the breeze as they cruised by us as we walked in the hot sun made us decide that some new bikes were definitely in order right away! \n\nHe called the shop a day before we visited and the salesman who answered was wonderful: asking a few lifestyle needs related questions and then recommending that we consider Electra brand bikes for our relatively simple needs and modest budget for this spur of the moment purchase. \n\nWe researched them online and found that consumers love the classic design of the one speed cruisers, high quality construction including patented flat foot operation making frequent city stopping and starting easy plus their very low maintenance requirements. Sounds good! \n\nWhen we arrived the next day, Bill greeted us promptly and showed us to the requested bikes right away while sharing some general features and benefits of this brand and reinforced our initial positive feelings about Flying Fish Bike Shop as well as the bikes we thought we wanted to purchase. \n\nHe welcomed us to take a test drive so we each made a selection of color and style and after he carefully adjusted the seat and handlebar heights, we took them for a 10 min spin around the quiet residential neighborhood behind the bike shop, perfect for getting a good feel before making a purchase. \n\nMy bf loved his choice right away, but I did not find mine to be comfortable at first, so Bill adjusted the seat height again that was much better but a beautiful 3 speed lilac colored \"Townie\" model had caught my eye when we first arrived and while it was significantly more expensive than the simple one speed cruiser, I wanted to take it for a spin just to see and I LOVED IT! It was perfectly comfortable and operated exactly as I had hoped, so the decision was made. \n\nTwo bikes, lights for front and back, a basket and bell for mine, a bike lock for both etc and the team in the back of the shop worked quickly to get the bikes customized for us as we paid up all the while learning about incredible riding trails and local bike events - even monthly pub and restaurant crawls - and then rode them home. \n\n\nBuying local is important to me and the selection and service was top notch here. You get what you pay for and more and your purchase also includes a free tune up a month or so after owning your bike plus a warranty on top of the manufacturer's warranty. \n\nWhen you are in need of a bike or accessories, even just some valuable free bike related advice, this is a great place to check out!",

Our last visit was to support Dining Out For Life, an annual fundrasier for the Damien Center. \n\nI was surprised to see the menu had recently changed, and the beloved (by me, and perhaps not many others apparently) dolmades are off the menu. So, on this visit I tried something new! I ordered the veggie quesadillas and added spinach. Good choice, and this might just be my new staple! This dish packs heat, so beware. \n\nOther things I love about the Brew Pub:\n-Plentiful outdoor dining space\n-Interesting and truly homemade menu options\n-Beers available by the pint, or in smaller portions (this was much more appealing to me when I was a breastfeeding mom and just wanted a smidge of my favorite Porter)\n-Great kids menu (go for the Shepherds Pie, every time!)\n\nThings that add to the charm of the Brew Pub, but might be irritating to some:\n-Slow-ish service\n-Cigarette smoke wafting over from the fire-pit area IF you choose to sit outdoors on that side of the building (not a fan of smoke? Request to sit on the street side and you'll be in the clear)",

Apparently it's GEEKS WHO DRINK night and it was kinda hysterical to watch (but we didn't participate).\n\nStella on tap, seats at the bar, happy hour specials - not bad for a quick reunion. Love all the military unit stickers all over the place and the SEAL Trident in the bar - reminded me a lot of a few places I've gone to on North Island and around the world. \n\nFood was typical bar food - some guy down the bar from us got the biggest hamburger I've ever seen (it was literally like a foot high) but it looked amazing. Had chicken tenders (was WAY too much for me but good) while Rob got the fish tacos, which were so good that he got two orders. \n\nGonna head there again tonight for some pre-gaming before the UA/Cal game - really looking forward to it!!",

  "text": "This place has grown on me over the years. I find myself going here more and more, despite the (fantastic) proliferation of coffee places in the northern Camden County area. It's just a solid place to come back to again and again, and hopefully this'll give you some insight into why.\n\nLet's start with the seating. It's got a lot of different areas to hang out; aside from two large seating areas on either side of the counter, there's an awesome courtyard right on the corner of Haddon and Redman Avenues and plenty of sidewalk seating out front for the warmer months. Not enough places in the suburbs have outside areas for hanging out, so these spots for people - and puppy - watching is much appreciated.\n\nTheir coffee's always been pretty good, and I think they keep switching up what beans they get. From what I can remember, I've seen Rival Brothers, Square One. They do pour overs, which I love, and they've got some more exotic things sometimes, like the Gibraltar (a variation on a cortado) and the \"Americola\", a fascinating mix of Mexican coke and a shot of espresso. To eat, there've got a variety of pastries like muffins and homemade pop tarts and quiches.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this is one of the only coffee places open on a late Sunday afternoon/early evening worth going. There're a lot of coffee places around here, but they all seem to close between 1 and 3PM. For years now, Jersey Java's open open til 6PM on Sundays, which I really appreciate. I don't know if the other places think people just hide out at home on Sunday afternoons or what, but it's great this place stays open.",

  "text": "The Blue Duck describes itself as a relaxed tavern featuring classic and new American eats. OK, I can go with that. I stopped in on a Tuesday night to the new Maplewood location with my father and stepmother. We got there right around six and we were the only table but after a couple of minutes it started filling up. Thank goodness because I have a thing about being the only table in a restaurant. I never want to eat somewhere that no one else wants to eat but we were OK here. Our server was friendly and pleasant but not that well versed on the menu. My father was asking about the Chow Chow side and she was trying to describe the flavor to him and I blurted out that it's pickled vegetables and she said oh yes, pickled is correct, they're pickled. So we ordered the Falafel Balls (harrissa tahini, smoked green tomato jam, cilantro, grilled flatbread) appetizer for the table. The grind of the chickpeas was too fine and the falafel had little flavor. The pita bread had a nice char but was very thick and cut in tiny triangles. The harrissa tahini turned out to be incredibly spicy and we are a family that likes heat. My father ate so much of the sauce he was sucking on ice cubes to relieve the heat. He was worried he wasn't going to be able to eat his entree. He ordered the DLT, a duck sandwich, and subbed the side for a small salad. The salad was tiny and no big deal but the sandwich he really liked. He commented on how moist and flavorful the duck was. My stepmother ordered the Seared Trout. This dish was beautifully presented and quite good. There was a tower of fried brussels sprouts on top and a squash puree under the fish. It was all excellent. As soon as I read the Pastrami and Pimiento sandwich I knew I had to order that. I love pastrami and I love pimiento cheese. I got the Mac N Cheese side which was just fair. The sandwich was delicious. I was only able to eat half of it. It was messy but good. I'd order it again and again. They ordered the cookie plate for dessert but I couldn't eat any. I was too full. The macarons looked delicious. Maybe next time.",

A friend and I stumbled across this place one day and it's now become our go-to. Whatever you do, GET THE TILAPIA BURRTO. Don't let the captain crunch scare you because somehow it works. The short rib tacos sell out if you arrive too late in the day, but I actually prefer the chicken anyway. And the curry is sweet, savory, and piping hot. The katsu is probably my least favorite thing on the menu, and I even love that. Everything from the tortilla to the rice, and even the garnishes and sauces at this place are perfectly made and balanced. DEFINITELY worth a visit!",

Very dimly lit maroon-colored with random Russian-esque art haphazardly hung about and small cutesy little courtyard in the back. \nYou can get your absinthe fix here (although yeck, the stuff is foul!) or just stick to your regular spirits and beer.  I think they have all sorts of vodka here - that's their shtick?  That and their absinthe.  I vodka, hate absinthe - do you get what I'm trying to say here?\n\nAnyway, the bartenders are typically quite friendly, the drinks really vary in alcohol potency, but I stick to the basics here.  I don't think they have specialty cocktails to the best of my knowledge.\n\nI love sitting up against to the booth seating to the left and just observing the people ebbing and flowing from Pravda - usually younger hipster kids, pseudo-goth people, and sometimes older people set up shop here with their books and laptops (there are classic books available on the shelves here, should you feel a moment of bold literacy). \n\nThere's free wifi here, which is good as my phone signal usually blows in here.  \n\nI would say that it's never gotten REALLY crowded in here, so it's a perfect pre-gaming or post-gaming site.",

The fountain in the front provided a nice soothing water white noise and awesome private rooms with sunken tables and seating areas where you have to take your shoes off. :)\n\nI tried the Sweetheart Roll with spicy tuna and mango with tuna on top; the tuna roll and another roll that I don't remember the name of with shrimp tempura inside and tempura banana on top with a sweet sauce. I loved the sweetheart roll, especially the heart presentation. Too cute. The tuna was really fresh and tasty on both the sweetheart and the plain tuna roll. They weren't shy with the fish either! The banana/shrimp tempura roll was a little too sweet for me together so I ate the banana separately but I still enjoyed it.\n\nI would definitely return to Tako if I happened to be in the area.",

The answer is YES PLEASE!). They're high quality and full of rich flavour. \nIf you're looking to take your tea experience to the next level, I suggest you try some of their freshly bakes scones. They come served on a lovely platter with a side of fresh cream and jam. **drool**\nThe owner herself (Cally!) is usually in the shop, making sure you're enjoying your experience. She's incredibly friendly, approachable, and makes a genuine effort to get to know you. \nWhile tea and dessert at Cally's isn't super cheap (it's not super expensive either), you definitely get what you pay for; delectable teas and baked goods, knowledgeable and friendly staff who go above and beyond, and an overall great experience. \nTo top it all off, Cally's Teas takes customer service to a whole new level. When I mentioned that I was lactose intolerant, I was quickly informed that they didn't have any lactose free options for me... BUT, I was told by Cally herself that on my next visit, I should call ahead before coming in, and the staff would make sure to have a lactose free option available and waiting for me. \n:O!!!!! Customer service like that is hard to find. \nTell ya what Cally's Teas, I'll definitely be back... and I'm bringing everyone I know.",

First of all, the staff was very nice and I loved their set up. It was both indoors and out. The indoors offered more of an art set up and little shopping centers. The outdoors was very beautiful and relaxing. I took a lot of pictures because it was giving me ideas of different plants and landscape that I can do around my house. Also, the further you walk up, there was the Lilly house along with a tour. It was enormous and  gorgeous inside. I won't tell you who the Lilly family was because I don't want to ruin the tour for you guys in case you'll decide to check it out. They also had the beer garden which we didnt get a chance to check out because we had other places to be. They have their own parking lot and Cafe shops with plenty of seating areas. I would visit again just because I didn't get a chance to walk and see everything. You will spend a couple hours out there. I even seen some couples having a picnic.

We were never asked to move faster than our pace, our waters kept refiling and our waiter had no issues clearing our numerous wine bottles. We were one of the last parties in there and he still very happily gave us dessert recommendations. The one thing that was off was that our dishes didn't come out together so we waited awkwardly for all 4 main courses to arrive before we started eating. Other than that, I would definitely come back here for another BYO dinner!",

For those complaining on price, this is not Taco Bell. If you wants 69 cent taco's stuffed with \"meat\" then go there. For those complaining on staff, I have had nothing but appreciative and informative order takers (as that's really the only people you interact with other than the people who deliver your order a la Tijuana Flats). Lastly, for those complaining on taste...huh?\n\nI'm not Mexican or by any means a food expert but that said, I like eating...a lot. This is now my go-to Mexican place when I'm home (sadly, Senor Taco http://www.yelp.com/biz/senor-taco-pinellas-park is closer to work and takes the cake w/ the 5 stars)\n\nI've had the fish and spicy pork taco's here...both were on point. I will say, with the fish, I didn't so much like the pineapple but I knew it was on it when I ordered it...and had no problem scarfing it down all the same. The spicy pork taco was a taco lovers dream, yum. Why have you guys not taken pictures of their food yet?!?!? Added my taco pic!\n\nI've also had the carne asada torta here which is replacing my normal ordering at this place...this thing was a HUGE sandwich...stuffed with carne asada, smothered in guac and black beans, grilled onions, and awesome.\n\nI've parked at the boxing place both times and haven't had problems (even though there's sign warning not to)...what can I say..I'm a risk taker.",

I am working my way through their menu, and always have a hard time deciding which of their flavors to try next. \n\nTheir Passion Fruit is light, tasty and seems to be made from real fruit. It is perfect for these hot summer days. The coconut is delicious, milky and spot on for coconut flavor. The Matcha is exactly what you would expect, and goes so well with their delicious boba. My personal favorite, the Taro, is to die for. \n\nThe two people behind the counter are very friendly, and seem to be working very hard all the time. I've never seen this place without a line, but they work through it efficiently. Their prices are reasonable. For the same price as Bing's large, you would only get a small at some other places in town. But best of all, you get tons of their delicious boba in each cup. (I normally have to force myself to ration the boba in bubble tea, but with this place I have enough for every sip!) I love having enough boba to last my entire drink, and this is the only place I've ever experienced that.\n\nMy only complaint is their location. I hope they do well enough to open a more central location, but until then I am happily driving across town for my next fix.",

The house-made chips are a perfect example. One time they were perfection, served with a spicy dip; another time they were cold and greasy business. The cheese fries were incredible. Bacon, chili, and more of the spicy dip. The pineapple fritters had amazing ingredients....and were served a tad bit burned. I really liked the Midwest BLT (Fried green tomatoes on a sandwich, awesome.) One of my favorite sandwiches in the Tampa Bay area is the Rib and Mac. Oh. So. Good! The Fried Oreo Sundae is a decadent end to any American meal.\n EATS! also offers a pretty solid burger on Mondays for $5. You can add toppings for a little extra $. I added chili and cheese, yum!

I found that across the board (with only 3 or 4 exceptions) that Rollin Oats is not only cheaper, but sometimes substantially cheaper!!!!!! I compared identical item, brand & size to make sure I had an exact comparison.  There is nothing that they don't have that we need.  At first, I found myself still going to Publix every now and then but now that they have expanded the store size, I can find everything! They will also special order stuff for you, no problem.

  "text": "Wow! I'm in love here! New fav Italian spot on the other side of the bay. I met my husband here on his dinner break. A nice mom and pop spot with dark intimate lighting and friendly serving staff. My husband got there before me so I just walked in and sat with him. The menu is clean and laid out nicely. They have what most Italian places have. Plus, they had a few French & Mediterranean items. I wanted to stick to something light and fresh so I ordered the Faithful farms mixed salad while my husband ordered the Penne a la Vodka.\n\nI was so happy with my choice! What a gorgeous salad, colorful fresh and the flavor a meshed so well together. When I saw my husband's penne I knew I'd be snagging a bite or two.......ok so it was like 8 bites. Haha. My salad had fresh sliced strawberries, peaches/nectarines, dried fig, tomatoes & dragon fruit! Now I've never had nor seen dragon fruit, but the color is vibrant neon purple. The salad mixed was arugula mostly, Gorgonzola and a vinegarette (sp). I was so please to have such a beautiful layout of my salad.   My husband penne a la vodka was creamy goodness to my tastebuds (get your minds out of the gutter!). Seriously, my fav penne vodka dish is back home in VA and they use applewood smoked bacon. Here at Luigi's it's chicken. And it was still delicious. The bowl was overflowing with penne, sauce and cheese. I want to go back and just order another to enjoy myself! \n\nOf course at check in you get a 10% off your meal. So my reason I gave 4 stars is when we showed our waitress the offer on Yelp she took my phone and was like \"hold on a sec\", I watched as she went behind the bar to show another waitress and she shook her head and you could tell she had an attitude about it. Well if you don't want your business giving 10% off a bill, remove the offer. So they did take it off our bill, but we of course tipped based on the original bill amount. We've both worked in food service so we know about serving & how to tip. But, It was just weird she walked off with my phone. I'd make sure they have the manager come to you vs walking away w your cell. We will definitely go back. The food was perfect!",

But my problem is the service. We went on Sunday and after sitting at a table for about 5 minutes I went up and ordered beers at the bar from the bartender.  I grabbed menus and after sitting with our beers for another 5 to 10 minutes i was able to flag down a waiter. We ordered an appetizer. The appetizer was brought and I was told that he would return in a minute with plates and napkins. Never happened. We finished the appetizer and ordered another beer from the waiter. We were never asked if we wanted more food or water although I saw other tables with glasses and pitchers of water on them. In fact, he walked by us with a pitcher of water twice. To get my check, I had to go back to the bar and ask the bartender to ring it out.  If this were the first time, maybe I would be kinder. Unfortunately it is not. Often you can't tell if there is wait staff or not. So, go for the great beer- try a Take Me to Church- but be prepared to get it yourself.",

  "text": "This place. So, you're going to look at most of these reviews and feel like this place must be pretty good. Which is exactly what we did when we found ourselves in Maplewood and hungry.\n\nBut. An $8 \"vegetable\" salad consisted of arugula and carrots (barely heated up and basically raw) with an über salty brown butter \"dressing\". And it was on a side salad plate. Not good.\n\nWe continued to the veal meatballs which were completely dried out and dense. They didn't even really taste like veal -- you expect a little gaminess with some sort of aggressive spice. We got nothing. The polenta on the plate and the sauce was pretty good though (and it's a lot of food, definitely shareable if the meatballs themselves were better).\n\nThen, it was on to dessert. We love dessert. Especially panna cotta. And even more if it's chocolate. Which is what was advertised. What we got though? Some sort of watery, jello-y concoction ... I wish I would have taken video. It was so weird. Like it was made from a box with water instead of cream, or milk even. Tasteless and boring.\n\nAnd damn, expensive to boot. I can't imagine a scenario where I would want to go back here -- unless I just wanted to sit down for a while with a glass of wine, cause it is a nice looking place with nice people working there and what appears to be a good, extensive wine list (we did not partake). Just, the food. Yikes.",

  "text": "Came here for a wedding, spent the night at the inn, had both a catered meal at the reception, and breakfast inside the following morning.  So, I'm not pro to the Mendenhall Inn, but I've definitely sampled pretty much all they have to offer.  :)\n\nI'm going to go in chronological order, and highlight the pros and cons.\n\nCHECK-IN\n\nPROS: \n* Clean lobby, very friendly and inviting.\n* Covered area to pull up and check in during inclement weather; it was raining that afternoon, so this was quite welcomed.\nCONS:\n* Wow, what shoddy service... The woman checking everyone in did so in a one-by-one fashion, which is fine, but not when the rooms aren't all ready.  We were arriving for a wedding that afternoon, and though they were only promising a room ready by 3pm, many people were being checked in before we got to the front.  When we did get up there, our room was NOT ready.  So, we spent 15 minutes in line waiting for something it took her a second to check.  Maybe she was too busy... but what about the receptionist sitting about five feet away from her, not interacting with the long line at all, not helping, not even making eye contact?  That's just plain ignorant customer service.  Then, the woman who was checking us in said she couldn't even check us in without our room being ready yet.  Some line about \"that's how our computer system works.\"  Yeah, bull.\n* So, anyway, we had to just hang out or go get a drink somewhere, which we did (Buckley Tavern, yay!), all the while pondering the wasted quarter of an hour that we could have spent getting dressed/made up in another room.  Disgraceful.  \n* Here's the kicker, and what really ticked us off.  When we came back almost an hour later, another person, possibly a manager, was also helping to check people in.  Where was he before?  Both women from earlier were there, the first one still doing her gig, and the second actively running back and forth, but still not making eye contact with any customers.  What was her actual role, I wonder?  Anyway, the guy checks us in, and clearly he knows how to work the computer system I guess, because our original room was STILL not ready, but he found us one that was!  Imagine that!  The power this guy must have had, where he could click and type and make magically appear a room of exact description where we could rest our weary heads and change before the rapidly approaching nuptial ceremony!\n* Okay, so, I'm a little bitter, whatever.  Anyway, long story short, I know you're a busy inn with a lot of events, but that's why you plan accordingly.  Hire more staff on a temp basis if you have to, but get the rooms cleaned out and find the right staff for up front to check them in.  That was embarrassing for your hotel, and I certainly wouldn't want you representing me in my business.\n\nCEREMONY/RECEPTION (in the Grand Ballroom)\n\nPROS: \n* Big space, very lovely, enchanting chandeliers and décor...\n* Catered dinner was agreeable, nothing too drastic in any direction.\n* Incredible bar-tending crew!  Very fast on the creations, knew their craft well, and were quite friendly to everyone!\n\nCONS: \n* One serves from the left and clears from the right, monsieur.  Minor complaint, but indicative of the level of training their wait staff has had.\n* Little things, like a light bulb out here, a hole in the wall there, not big stuff, but minor ticky-tacky stuff, but it adds up over time.  Place just needed a once-over by someone who cares greatly about the finished product.\n* Nothing was really standing out in the main meal.  The soup was tasty (crab/asparagus, we think), but the salad was kind of bland, the chicken was a bit dry, and the white sauce was borderline flavorless and incognito.  Hardly memorable fare, at least not for the right reasons.\n\nROOM\n\nPROS:\n* VERY comfortable bed!  I got a great night's sleep.\n* Clean.  Hopefully a given this day and age, but want to point it out all the same.\n* Powerful shower head, and up at a good height for a tall person.  I didn't have to crouch over to wash my hair!  Being a taller gent, I appreciate that.\n* Free WiFi!\n\nCONS: \n* Not super huge, but that's a minor complaint.\n\nBREAKFAST\n\nPROS: \n* Great selection of items, most of which seemed to be very fresh.\n* Make-your-own waffles!  Always a good idea, especially for the kids!\n\nCONS:\n* Sausage was inedible, very disgusting.\n* Potatoes were undercooked and bland.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThe convenience of having the wedding, reception, and rooms all in one place was phenomenal, and I would readily stay here again for such an event.  The hidden gem was the restaurant attached, which we kind of took over after the reception.  The calamari was actually pretty darn tasty, too!\n\nI'd be wary about checking in, but overall a good place to stay.  I'd like to go back and try the restaurant for dinner someday.  Looked very tempting.  Bartenders were really awesome there, too!",

  "text": "I do love scrolling through the reviews of fellow Yelpers to see how experiences vary.  I am coming down in the camp of \"Great lunch spot close to work and verrrryyyy intrigued by the selection of whiskey and bourbon\" but that last one will have to wait until happy hour ;)\n\nHad seen the overall rating of Hendrick's as good and wanted to give it a shot as there is NO WHERE to eat in Hazelwood..seriously..no where..NO I DO NOT WANT JIMMY JOHNS!!!  :)\n\nSo I dragged a coworker along to sample some BBQ.  Slow at lunch but as many have noted the decor is great! I am a huge blues fan so the portraits and short bios were a great touch.  The Blues Bar remains unopened as of this review and i couldn't get a projected opening date.  \n\nTwo sandwiches were consumed (and I do have to comment that I was confused by a fellow Yelpers note that no sides are offered with entrees?  I am 82% sure that they were on the menu i perused) with appropriate sides (slaw, beans and fries).  I had pulled pork and I do agree it is neither pulled in the traditional sense, not super smokey and not wet (but guess why you have sauces at the table).  But the pork was tender and juicy..I can work with that..  Coworker had a brisket sandwich and based on the quick disappearance appeared to have no qualms.\n\nBut the drink menu..local beers only on tab...no INBEV is not local..I was very happy to see that the are supporting UCBC, Four Hands, Charleville, and others on their taps (and yes Mr and Mrs. Inbev you are there in bottles).  But the whiskey slections..you crazy beautiful bastards!  Pappy van Winkle 15 year...really??!? I think I just drooled on myself..although you cant get Pappy in any flight (and it would be waste to do that) there appeared to be some creative thought given to all the flights as well as the signature cocktails.\n\nAs another Yelper noted there is no BBQ in St. Charles (well not that I am aware of) and there is no similar selection of local brews AND selection of whiskeys anywhere in St Louis....well I haven't been to EVERY Bar",

  "text": "I can't believe I'm just now reviewing this awesome place that I've been going to since moving into the neighborhood almost two years ago. This is not just a pub. It has helped establish a little area of wonderful restaurants and unique shops called Riverside Village.\n\nIt's cozy, classy, and friendly, with an excellent neighborhood vibe. They strive to keep it local with an impressive selection of local brews, considering the small size of the bar. Make sure to try a Mule, which is your choice of vodka, whiskey, or rum (I think) mixed with ginger beer, served in an almost too cold to touch pewter mug. Go for Mule Mondays and get them half priced!\n\nI was disappointed at the food selection when I first went, but now actually crave their yummy pretzel sandwiches. I'm not usually a cheese dip fan, but they have the BEST beer cheese dip served with hot breaded pretzels. It's SOOO good. \n\nThis is not a sports bar, but the owners love the Preds, and turn up the sound for those games on the few TV's they have. \n\nSpeaking of the owners, they are truly awesome folks!\n\nFor nice days out, the patio is perfect and usually packed. Live music, somewhat quiet as this is partially in a residential area, is featured some nights. \n\nWe have taken a lot of out of town friends here, and they all seem to love it. This was even where everyone hung out and had a fantastic time after our rehearsal dinner.",

  "text": "I love trying new drinks and the Underground is definitely a great place to try new beers.  There are 72 beers on tap and featured on their own menu.  All of the beers are sorted by score with a pretty decent description of what you're about to order.  That's one thing I definitely appreciate, as I love trying new beers but don't want to order a pint completely blind, I'd rather know if it's hoppy or not, a porter, etc. As for their food, I've never had an issue with their burgers or mains.  On this past visit there I had their pulled pork nachos ($19) and while they were good and had a great ratio of cheese to nacho, I found it was a little small for my liking - normally nachos are stacked!  The tray was a decent size but there was really only one layer of chips.  Good for sharing with one other person, but I think if we had gone in a group we would have needed more food.\n\nLast night's service was great and our food came out reasonably fast.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy so it's great for date nights or catch up with friends.  I don't come here that often in the summer time as it's located in the basement - I'd rather hit up somewhere where I can drink while enjoying the sunshine :)",

  "text": "I've stayed here countless times when I travel to Nashville for business.  I like how it's not too far from all the action, but still convenient to the downtown area and right near the highway.  I also love visiting the Gulch neighborhood so this location is perfect for that.  The hotel is also usually on the more budget-friendly end of the cost spectrum, which is great. One of my favorite bars is located just behind the hotel so it's a bonus to be able to visit every time I stay there. It's also near some great restaurant options, including the famous Hattie B's hot chicken. Front desk staff are friendly- free cookie bars are usually available during check-in hours in front of the little store area and you get a free GooGoo chocolate bar and Nashville postcard in your room. (Another freebie is bottled Dasani water upon check-in, if you are a Starwood member.) Expensive but convenient valet and self parking- valets are always very fast and friendly, unlike many of the other Nashville hotels. There's also a free shuttle bus that runs regularly between the hotel and downtown locations, and anywhere else you like within the city.  The rooms are standard, but they are clean and fairly spacious...mini-fridge and Keurig coffee maker are available in the room.  The only negative is that the hotel rate doesn't include a free breakfast, but hey, you're in Nashville...head to the Gulch for Biscuit Love! The hotel was recently renovated as well so it's pretty nice and comfortable.  Definitely one of my top choices whenever I stay in Nashville.",

This is ground zero for people watching on 21st.  You can watch all the people buzzing about, getting to work, shopping, etc.  There are big tables and smaller tables so all types of parties can be accommodated outside.  \n\nThe second win is the menu.  Pretty much everything in this place is unique and tastes pretty darn good.  I love the Verde dip as an appetizer.  It is great for a big group of people, but some of my favorite dishes are the Panni Sandwiches.  You can really never go wrong with a Cuban with loads of pork and crisp pickles.  So good!  They also do a brunch too, so anyplace that believes in breakfast on the weekend completely scores.\n\nThe beer, wine and mixed drinks list is amazing.  Jacksons is committed to some serious high gravity beers like BBC Bourbon Stout, Victory Garden Monkey and Abbey.  They do have the good old standards like Yazoo and Jackaloupe on tap too.  The wine list is big and they do feature a wine of the moment for only $6 a glass.  This changes alot.  Jacksons is pretty innovative with drinks.  My favorites is the Misery and Gin:  Gin, Pear Cider, and Ginger is pretty different, but oh so good.",

The server had been there since they started in the 70s. For a pizza place to survive that long and in the same family, they must be doing something right.\n\nI went with a cheesesteak hoagie and the wife had their 10\" pizza. They are supposedly known for their cheesesteaks and they advertise 1/2 pounders. I must say that i was pleasantly surprised, it was very good. The steak was juicy and the roll was extremely fresh. There was an ample amount of meat and the sandwich was seasoned as it should be. Next time I would get the roll toasted. The pizza was also good but different. I love the cheese to sauce ratio, I always prefer more cheese than sauce. The cheese blend is unique and adds a nice flavor, I think it's provolone and mozzarella. The crust was nice and crispy but a little thick for our liking. Overall it was a good reasonable lunch and we would return. Solid 4 stars.",

For $50.00 on the weekends you get a full 6 course experience complete with dancing (and its mandatory). They offer affordable wine and we settled into a lengthy dinner experience. \nHighlights: \nThe focaccia with olive oil was the first item I tried and one of my favorites. It was perfect! I also loved the scallops, rigatoni with butternut squash, sage, and brown butter. I couldn't stop eating it! The herb crusted pork loin was a home run as well, and the cappuccinos with our donuts didn't disappoint either. I wasn't such a fan of the short rib pasta or the risotto cakes (very bland), but the good thing about this experience is it's family style, and you get to try a bit of everything and if you aren't a fan of one item, another heaping dish is right behind it for you try! \nThe staff was absolutely incredible and fun, and you can tell that this isn't just a restaurant, it's a passion for them! I appreciated all the work they put into making our meal an experience.",

  "text": "First things first, this is a dining establishment within the Ritz Carlton, so like all resorts a meal comes with a fairly high price tag. I know this going in...so...aside from that what's not to enjoy about spending the day relaxing poolside with a gorgeous view to the Arizona desert and the loveliest most polite staff in the Tucson city limits? Turquesa is the poolside restaurant at the resort. The menu covers your standard Latin fare from tacos to Nachos, salads, guacamole, ceviche and more. After two days at the pool we determined our favorite item were the Nachos. A GIANT bowl that's easily big enough for 6 people is about $11 with all the fixings- cheese, jalapeños, nachos, a TON of cheese, and your choice of chicken or meat. These nachos are legit. Sure, the green chile tacos were tasty and the grape fruit and avocado salad was certainly crispy and refreshing, but a giant bowl of nachos with a buckets of Tecate light can't be beat. Ultimately, the staff at Turquesa makes it worth while. The team here is all smiles and seriously at your service. Mac and Joel are two in particular that were so wonderful to our group. They remembered us by name the next day too! And our orders. I love staying at the Ritz for a staycation and the team at Turquesa makes the poolside experience totally fabulous.",

The paella was awesome filled with chicken, sausage, and veggies. We both very much enjoyed it. \n\nAs for the not so positives, my margarita swirl was not good. I wasn't able to drink more than a few sips. Also, our waitress was a smart ass. Weeks later, I'm still not sure if she was rude or funny. I'll keep pondering that. \n\nI would definitely return for paella, but I may skip some of the other parts of the experience.",

  "text": "Having returned to El Camino Real twice in the last month for dinner, a few conclusions can be made since my last review over a year ago. First of all, it has exploded with popularity. Dinner service, even at 5pm, is extremely popular. It has become a trendy place to see and be seen in the uber-chic neighborhood of Northern Liberties. \n\nThe second observation is directly tied to the first- the outstanding food. No wonder El Camino has drawn rave reviews and grown exponentially since my first taste; the food is magnificent. Without a touch of pretense, the menu reflects both Tex Mex and authentic Mexican cuisine. It is extensive and has options for both the picky and adventurous, the carnivore and vegetarian, the glutton and the lush. \n\nMay I point out that the Fried Pickle Chips are heaven-sent? I sometimes catch myself daydreaming about them at nite. The crisp vinegary crunch of the pickles, the savory, molten hot breading, and of course, the spicy, smooth, simply decadent chipolte mayo dip served on the side makes my mouth water. The flavors explode in your mouth in a WOOSH of satisfaction. The Fried Pickle Chips at El Camino Real are my favorite appetizer in Philadelphia. \n\nI won't wax poetic about the rest of the menu, but just know that it is nearly equal to the said satisfaction of the Pickle Chips. Just to name a few, I love the Texas cheesesteak, the pork bellies, the chili and the enchiladas.  \n\nFurthermore, El Camino distinguishes itself in decor as well. It isn't overly oozing faux authenticity the way that the Cantina begs to (for real, you use flour tortillas, so let's not pretend this is actually South of the Border, ok??) and yet still satisfies the exotic taste inherent to Tex-Mex. The servers are great, it is not overly loud, and oh yeah, the brunch is amazing too. \n\nLooking for a good Tex-Mex joint in Philly that will satisfy your Mexican craving? El Camino Real is the place to go.",

There are plenty of tables (square tables so good for laptops), free WiFi, and lots of people on laptops -- my kind of place. A lot of med students and people on laptops camp out here all day, which can be kind of annoying when trying to find a seat at a busy time, but I'm one of those people too (I stay for 2 hours tops) so I can't complain. The coffee is great and there are a ton of non-coffee items to choose from if you're not into caffeine.

For value, go elsewhere.  For pretty food, lovely store displays and a feeling of smugness, check out Whole Foods.\n\nDespite my snark, I have to admit that it's nice to see an enormous, clean and well stocked yuppie market in Reno finally.

For myself, I'm too cheap to look seriously at this place for my regular shopping needs, but for lunch and the odd stopover, it's awesome.   Beautiful produce, drool inducing cheese selections and a bakery that would break my budget if I bought everything that struck my fancy.\n\nPlus it's proximity to the freeway (for those of us who do our shopping based on distance from the 395 or 80) makes it an ideal stop to/from the airport.",

The salad consists of mixed greens, salami, smoked turkey, tomato, garbanzo beans and parmesan cheese served with the house vinaigrette. The salad was lacking for me. I think such a salad would be so much better with a few more Italian-esque ingredients in it, perhaps a little more anitpasto like. I know, it's not advertised as antipasto but c'mon....this salad was boring.  Throw in a couple of olives, some artichoke hearts, some sliced pepperoncinis. Maybe my tastebuds were having an off day but the salami wasn't very flavorful either. Charge a couple dollars more for a more inventive salad. Please!\n\nI do want to give them another chance since so many reviews on here are glowing. Maybe I need to stick with a panini or something but I really do love salads for summer lunches.",

  "text": "First impression:\n\nHome Wine Kitchen's \"No Menu Monday\" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\n\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\n\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?",

For our main dishes we ordered the calamari, saganaki and bureki and the lamb kofta entree. \n\nThe Calamari was served with a side of Armenian tomato dip. It was perfectly cooked and tasted light, crispy and tender.Next up was the Saganaki- a favorite of mine. The pan friend halloumi cheese was served in ouzo and lemon sauce with a delicious caramelized fig and side salad. This was one of the best I've had...including those which were devoured on many restaurants in Athens, Mykonos and Paros.  The Bureki was served next: a fillo pastry parcel stuffed with feta and thyme drizzled with honey served with a side of roasted beats. The presentation was so beautiful with a taste to match. Crispy layers of fillo oozing with feta cheese. The Count found that the honey made it more appropriate for dessert but I loved it, especially the presentation.\n\nThe lamb kofta was served next. It was a skewer of ground lamb kofta mixed with apricot and pistachios served with a  side of pomegranate salad, lentils and Greek yogurt. The lamb was excellent filled with magic flavors. But what truly made it special were the side dishes. The pomegranate salad was so original. I've never had pomegranate served as a salad as in Iran it tends to be eaten as a fruit or juiced. The mixture of pomegranate with onions and spices was excellent. Then there was the lentil salad which was again a first for me. I mixed spoonfuls of the kabob, pomegranate and lentil salad together and found the combination to be intoxicating. The quality of the ingredients are present in each spoonful. You can tell that the chef really prides himself on his food. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the pistachio and olive oil cake and warm chocolate mousse. Both desserts were out of this world. I really loved the pistachio cake it was light yet intense in flavors served with a side of pistachio ice cream and cherries.  The Chocolate mousse was baked to perfection oozing with warm gooey chocolate served with a scoop of ice cream. Wow. Is all I can say about this restaurant. I loved the food, the presentation and the friendly chef. Kanella offers rustic home-made dishes with fresh and mostly organic ingredients. I was very impressed and can easily say this was one of the best places I've yet to dine",

  "text": "Full disclosure: I've never taken a fitness class of any kind in public much less a spin class. I had the opportunity to take a class as part of a Yelp event. I was glad to learn beforehand that my friends who were first-timers like me were pretty much as terrified (in a good way?) as I was! \n\nOur instructor Chris was very funny and helpful in letting us know how to get \"clipped in\" and how the bikes worked. I think next time I'll be raising my handlebars, but it wasn't too much of an issue. (Look at me, talking about \"next time\". We'll see!) I think the music plays a big part in keeping your energy up, but you definitely have to listen to your body and not be gassed by minute 20. I had to back off a few times and sit down while most were standing, but it's not about how good you look doing this. It's HARD WORK! By the end, I was more in the groove and could withstand the climb to the summit. It really helps to have a stat board, I think. I liked being able to see where I was, and it gave me a little extra motivation about sticking with it. After you're done, you definitely feel like you've accomplished something! \n\nI was expecting a standalone building, but CycleBar is in the middle of a little strip in front of Meijer. I wish there were more showers (one per private bathroom), but space is limited so they do a great job of maximizing the space. \n\nCycleBar offers water bottles so you don't have to bring your own, which is a nice touch. If I return, I'll be sure to bring it with me. (Because, come on, you don't need more than one!) I also love the fact that they don't do memberships (nobody likes those contracts) and offer packages of rides (and specials) that you can use when it's convenient for you! I'll be spreading the CycleBar love to all of my friends!",

You can't beat the location because it is one block from bourbon street and if you get lost, you can just look up for their sign towering above the hotel.

All of the gadgets are easily accessible to let you play around with and see if you would be comfortable using them. The new customer-centric vibe is inspiring to me, and makes me interested in going to a store front instead of buying online. Bonus for them -- I'm probably going to spend more somewhere if there is a person explaining how to use it, what they use it for, etc. I love to see enthusiasm when I'm being sold on new things :) Very excited about the home-integration system to turn on/off lights, lock doors, control thermostat, etc.  We all know technology is progressing, its great to see a store progressing its service just as much or more.",

The cool thing about the place is that there is a lot of wide open space and the \"family style\" tables allow you to get to know your fellow beer lovers. My one tiny complaint about the location is that I know it is gonna be really hot in there once summer hits. They have a few big fans going, but I can imagine you are going to have to come ready to sweat once the heat kicks up.\n\nI've had a few beers here. The two times I've been I've gravitated towards the Charming Wit, only because it's not super heavy and it's nice to sip on a warm day. I am eager to go back and try the fruit based beers as both of my visits here were brief.",

  "text": "I have visited the Good Oak Bar twice now and each time was quite happy! I can't say anything about the food because frankly, I didn't realize they even served food until I was ready to leave. \n\nDrink time...I was quite impressed! The sangria (go cones) blew my mind. I don't usually order sangria because I am not a fan of sweet drinks. The ingredients were so intriguing that I just couldn't resist and had to ask about them. Strawberry, Rhubarb, mint, basil, cucumber, and honey (I may be missing one or two)... I was convinced into trying it out. The bartender promised it wouldn't be too sweet. She was right! This drink was not sweet at all and you could be sure that every ingredient was all natural. I was in love! I also tried the coffee press... not something I would get on a regular basis but it was pretty good and something new and fun to do!\n\nThe ambiance was awesome. It seems like a little underground bar that not many know about but it is actually quite popping when you step inside. The bar was at least half full and every booth was taken each time I went in. What was great is that it didn't feel crowded and we were still taken care of very well! The owner happened to be in while we were grabbing a drink and he was really friendly. He stopped by the table, said hello and told us a little about this bar and his others in Tucson and Flagstaff. Before he was heading out he dropped back by just to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. You can't beat that... so we bopped on over to his other restaurant for dinner!\n\nI probably wouldn't make this spot one of my normal hang outs but it is a great place and I will be going back! It would be an awesome date place if you're looking for a drink or two and want to try something new! They have an adorable Photo Booth with fun lips, glasses, bow ties, and more fun sticks to take funny pictures.",

Pad See Yew: Made with Chinese broccoli and plenty of egg in a savory sauce.  Very very good.\n2. Red Penang Curry: Spicy and creamy with fresh veggies, plenty of beef, and the best curry broth.\n3. Ginger stir-fried chicken: Amazingly savory and cooked with tender pieces of chicken breast.  Great if you are looking for a non-spicy dish.\n4. Crispy duck fried rice: The duck definitely rivals Morimoto's with tender meat and a crispy skin.  The rice is delicious with plenty of veggies and egg.  \n5.  Siam Salmon: Great tangy sauce with a delicious fillet accompanied by crispy, fried crab.  Love!\n6. Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls: Filled with actual whole jumbo shrimp and served with a delicious dip.  This is unique to Jasmine Rice so highly recommend trying.\n7. Papaya Salad: Good but not differentiated from the other versions.\n8. Chicken Lettuce Wraps: A great spicy version of a classic.  It's a Gar pao accompanied with large Romaine leaves.  I would recommend getting a bowl of sticky rice and having the chicken with the rice.\n\nService is very attentive but the seating is pretty cramped so definitely book reservations for a party of more than 2.  It was a Tuesday night and packed!  Will be back to try more of the curries but so far so good!",

Your serving quality wines, and everyone knows Woodbridge does not fall into that category.  \nThe staff is friendly and provides good service, but while we were there they seemed to be over staffed and falling over each other. \nThey've decorated well for the holidays and I love the heated front patio and the fire pit in the back patio. \n I'll revisit and I am sure they'll pull it together so I can upgrade my # of stars.",

  "text": "Choosing to work with Kim Alexander, founder of No Macarena DJ & Custom Music Service, was one of the best decisions we made.  I first reached out to Kim in December of 2013 for our October 2014 wedding -- she was recommended by one of my coworkers, by one of the caterers we were considering, and by Adriana Robinson (site manager of our venue).  She replied to my email on the same day with a copy of her standard contract and some additional site-specific info on our venue.  \n\nI was sold on booking No Macarena, but my husband wanted to pursue hiring a friend.  Four months later we were left high and dry.  I frantically sent an email to Kim to see if she was still available.  She was prompt in her response and four days later we sent her our $500 deposit.  We loved how transparent Kim was with her fees, you won't find any nickel-and-diming here.  \n\nOur wedding venue, the Colonial Dames, is a 2-story, early 1920's house with several beautiful, private gardens.  We had our ceremony outside in the garden, moved inside on the first level for the cocktail hour, and then upstairs for our reception.  Kim was with us every step of the way from ceremony prelude to the last song of the night.  \n\nKim listened to our varied tastes -- we requested Pride & Prejudice (BBC & motion picture) music as well as Nirvana, Texas is the Reason, and Alice in Chains -- and tailored her selections to our crowd (30% baby boomers, 60% Gen X/Y).  Kim was phenomenal!   She pulled back on the volume during our tapas style dinner so our guests could mix and mingle without having to shout at one another, then got the party started with some oldies (but goodies) when it was time to dance.  \n\nWe highly recommend Kim and No Macarena.",

  "text": "The Tiki gods have answered my prayers! New Orleans now has a fabulous Tiki bar, with just the right dark Polynesian atmosphere that's straight outta Trader Vics circa 1965. My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved caçaca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).\n\nOh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle. Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.\n\nMore fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes. Apparently there's a tale of him drinking one too many zombies at Don the Beachcomber and then killed a pedestrian with his car. Bad Howie!! I hope it's not true. But yeah, beware the ENTIRE ZOMBIE MENU (seriously. TIki Tolteca has an entire zombie menu!!)\n\nWhat's next Tiki Tolteca? Maybe scheduled thunderstorms over a lagoon a la San Francisco's Tonga Room?",

It was a comfortable wait that didn't include standing awkwardly in the way of the servers. I think this place really benefits from having so much extra space. The decor was really cool. \n\nSo our party was three. So we three decided to try a bunch of things on the menu. Everything from mushroom hummus, yogurt, to the falafel. Then we got seconds. \n\nWe spent a good amount for three people but it was money well spent. I don't regret it and I'm eager to go back and try dinner sometime soon.\n\nP.S. don't leave without trying the French fries!",

  "text": "Overall, the food was tasty but way too spicy at times. As a baseline, I'm generally pretty wussy when it comes to spiciness. However, it was especially bad when the waitress said our pico de gallo was mild, only to discover it to be mouth searing, eye watering, cough inducing, cry for your mother hot! The waitress said nonchalantly mentioned that a serrano pepper may have gotten into it. To the naked eye, there were no visible signs of peppers in the dish. It would be helpful if the menu included some sort of rating scale regarding the hot/spiciness levels of the dishes. Not everyone has such a high tolerance for spiciness and I am definitely one of those people!\n\nThe tamales appetizer was tasty. There were two fairly small tamales for $16. This dish was spicy as well but not as much as the pico de gallo. I was able to tolerate the level of heat in this one. The taste was reminiscent of the homemade tamales that my friend's mother makes.\n\nI also enjoyed the quarter rotisserie chicken served with potatoes and sauce. As well as the quarter pork dish and potatoes. My boyfriend and I shared the meals and still had some leftover for takeout. Both of these meals were about $18 each. They were also served with tortillas and some salsa. \n\nChurros for dessert served with dulce de leche sauce was also very tasty. The churros were hot and crispy. They weren't coated in as much sugar as you would find in the amusement park versions of this dessert. I did however fantasized that the churros would've been perfect with plain vanilla ice cream.\n\nI'd recommend this place to friends and family, especially those who love spicy foods. I definitely caution those with low tolerance for heat, this food can definitely be hot!",

Caruso's is not a fancy Italian joint, which is a good thing. I find all fancy Italian restaurants to be duplicates of each other. Caruso's is best described as a superior flavored Buca Di Beppo or C&O.  Sad thing is I only went there on my last night in Tucson after 4 years. I'd love to go back, its got fantastic outside seating. Especially on those fantastic Tucson nights. I can't quite recall what I ordered, but I remember enjoying the bread, the side sausages(a lot!), and the prices!",

  "text": "I have to say, I always leave Yelp Events being impressed. However, this time I was impressed with myself in addition to the fine folks at Board and Brush! I'm fairly creative but it's more in writing and ideas, thinking outside the box kind of stuff! But apparently I'm pretty good at summoning something awesome from the depth of my inner creative cat! \n\nIf you've ever been to a paint and sip and even remotely enjoyed it you definitely have to give this place a visit! It's a little less structured than a paint and sip but I definitely enjoyed it a lot more because of that. The instructors give you all the steps of what you're going to be doing at the beginning and then it's up to you to work through it all at your own pace. I really loved that aspect because paint and sips make me feel a bit rushed. While here I got to really put the finishing touches on a couple of the steps I wanted to turn out well. \n\nWhen you sign up you get to choose your design that way they can have your wood and stencils ready for you when you show up. After the instructions are laid out they lets you go crazy banging, scraping, clawing and generally going to town on your wood to stress it and make it look like it's been through some stuff with you. After that you move on to staining and washing it so you can give it that perfect finish to match your sweet interior or exterior of wherever you have in mind for hanging it up. Once that happens you get to see how surgeon like your skills of placing your stencil down is.(this was the only part people seemed to have a bit of trouble with. But through teamwork and perseverance we got through it!) After that it's time to bring out your inner Bob Ross and get creative with coloring. Once your done designing your dream sign you rip the stencil off like a bandaid and proceed to pick your jaw off the floor because you just made awesome happen! Once that's done a little finishing wax is added and then they add some mounting supplies to the back and you're out the door like the newborn rockstar that you are. \n\nAshley and her crew of kids that she has working for her are really a fantastic bunch. They all have great ideas to help you achieve the perfection you might not even know you were capable of. I have to give a huge shoutout to Bella, she was an excellent tour guide through the land of possibilities I had in front of me. Together she helped me make probably the sweetest and most patriotic rendition of a rooster that place has ever seen! (Okay maybe I'm a little biased! But Ashley didn't help by telling me it was one of the coolest signs she's seen since they opened!) i had loads of fun and I definitely plan on coming back to make something else that I'll surely be proud to hang on my walls!",

  "text": "Was in town for work and while I typically stay at the Hilton Penn's Landing (Diamond Member), I had a free night at a Kimpton property that I was going to lose soon and decided to take advantage of it in the City of Brotherly Love.  I also took note that it was relatively close to my favorite pub in the city, Khyber Pass.  This location is in a cool historic part of town, excellent lobby and typical Kimpton feel/ambiance.  I did venture up to check out their rooftop bar but was beat so didn't stay for a drink.  Seems like a cool spot but without really any great views of the city.  Only issue I had was with valet taking longer than expected the next day while heading back to the airport.  I did like the texting service but 15 min turned into about 25 min and at the time I was leaving they really didn't seem that busy.  I believe it's $50 to park overnight as well which is a bit more than some other big cities I stay in such as LA and Seattle.  I didn't have an opportunity to try out their restaurant on site but I'd definitely consider staying at this property again in the future.",

Buyer beware: when you choose all of those delicious options for a build your own salad the price adds up fast!  That aside, I love HG.  I probably love too much for my own good and the good of my wallet.  It is a healthy oasis in the land of fried/mass manufactured crap that is City Ave.    \n\nHoneygrow's ordering system is all electronic and you can even swipe your own card to pay.  Bonus- they remember your previous orders with a card swipe so once you create the perfect lunch you don't have to rack your brain to remember what you put in that salad.  Their turnaround time on salads is very quick - under 5 minutes even during the busiest times.  I'll admit that I'm a lettuce snob (if it's wilting at all  or dirty get it out of my face) and I approve of the quality of HG's lettuce and the freshness of the rest of their produce.\n\nI'm not one for stir fry but many of my fellow lunchers rave about it as well as the smoothies.  \n\nOnly cons of HG:\n-Can get pricey, fast\n-Often hard to find a seat because they're so busy\n-They don't have salt packets and their salt shaker is weak....",

Wow, the charcuterie plate was amazing... there were three meats and three cheeses, homemade jam and mustard and garlic bread.  It was amazing, wow!  The scallops were also delicious, it was a small plate with 2 scallops but it was very very tasty.  The beef ribs were also amazing, but I am not a huge meat lover... my husband however devoured that plate.\n\nI had the mackerel for my main dish and it was very good, however I thought the appetizers were better then the main meal.

Conviniently located across the street from countryside mall, Tijuanas is an awesome place to chill, eat and drink when at countryside. \n\nFirst, their food is pretty fresh. It doesn't have a generic  pre-prepped taste. I am a huge fan of their chicken tacos, their chicken or steak chimichangas! The \nverde sauce is stellar! \n\nSecond,I absolutely love their hot bar. They keep the salsas exciting by changing them up ever couple of months. It's fun trying them while you wait for your food! Dare your friends to try the x_x faced ones. Lol.\n\nCons: I hate to admit that Tijuanas has had some pretty off days. I frequent here about 2 or 3 times a month on weekends or taco tuesdays. I will excuse them though because this place is often packed whenever my service is ho hum. Considering how popular this spot is, the food remained pretty consistent.\n\nOverall, If your first experience at Tijuanas is not the best, please don't write it off. This is really a cool spot to eat at as an alternative to chipotle or the lame mall food. The vibe is good, outdoor seating is plenty. They have a limited but satisfying selection of wine and beer too to keep your weekend of shopping super chill!",

We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. \n\nThe two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!\n\nDessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave. \n\nI will definitely return to try other menu items that looked great-like the pastas made in-house daily...that's next!!",

Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.",

Sure the fig olivade, \nbaba ganoush and hummus with pita bread were tasty but I don't think the price matched the plate? I also awkwardly waited for a table at the host counter for 5 minutes without any staff member addressing me during that time.\n\n-BUT THEN-\n\nA scrumptious glass of well-edited wine makes it sway to the table while a melodic live acoustic performance serenades the room makes me steer 4.

You can meet here for meetings, events, and or a low-key evening out due to the cast of mood lighting which literally feels like it swallows you. I dig it. I still have yet to check out the upstairs area but loved the spiral staircase that led up to it. \n\nI will try this place out again so hopefully I can finally make a \"big girl\" decision about this debate.

Had no problems getting in and finding a table, there were also plenty of open seats at the bar. \n\nLocation: down the street from Fogo & Mortons, around the corner from the crazy Dunkin Donuts on Penn, i.e. located just off a corner block-- so it's easy to stumble out and get a cab; or, park in the convenient public garage across the street.\n\nAmbiance: It is not 'lounge-ish', but relaxed & enjoyable nonetheless. It is a longish room, high loft ceilings, modern clean lines, grays and whites, soft lighting. Not too dark where you can't read the menu, not too bright where the mood is shattered. not too big not too small, trendy but not too cheesy I'm-trying-to-impress-you, not too loud that you can't hold a conversation without losing your voice, not too hushed that you feel awkward laughing outloud, high end but not pretentious. Bartenders in uniforms of vests and newsboy caps. Great place to come on your own, with a small group of friends, or on a date.  NOT a place to come to get rowdy.  \n\nService: The host greeted us with a welcoming smile, bartenders were all smiles and seemed to love what they were doing.  Waiter was extremely attentive, competent, and well-informed on all menu items.  No condescending or impatient attitudes anywhere.\n\nPrice: As mentioned by others, slightly higher prices but at this joint you know you are getting quality. And it caters to that clientele that can appreciate that distinction. I feel the price is right.\n\nDrinks: The drink menu is a work of art. This is not your average bar-- this is not even your average artisanal bar. This place serves up another realm in a glass. Excellent handcrafted concoctions. The menu is categorized by the main spirit-- i.e., gin, whiskey, rum, tequila, vodka, and yes, absinthe. You will find your classics as well as some more intriguing choices. The drinks are made of the finest ingredients, and each drink is precisely as you have wished it when placing your order.  Their signature, the Seelbach, was a successful delicious start.  Every drink thereafter was also divine. You can tell they really put time & effort in making their cocktails.  All are beautiful and there's an elegance to them.  Many come with very nice in-house steeped fruits & syrups. They do offer a fine wine and beer list but I could have cared less.  You want beer, go to Twenty-tap or Tomlinson. You want wine, go to Corner Wine Bar... or find your Opus at Kahns across the way.\n\nFood: Delicious small plates. Again, obvious invested thought, quality, and careful preparation here. I recommend getting food if you sit at a table. We had duck meatballs w gnocchi in a wonderful jus/sauce, 3-bacon flight w/ condiment sides of aioli/beets/horseradish-ketchup, lamb rilette w shallots/mustard/ super thin crostini, and the perfectly grilled one-eyed jack with fig jam & roasted garlic. the bacon (from Smoking Goose) was my favorite. Everything was delicate yet hearty, if that makes any sense. Next time I'm going for the apple salad, mushroom salad, beef tataki, and either the pate or one of the sandwiches.  We saw others getting the oysters. \n\nLittle Touches: white cloth napkins. fresh herb garnishes. check out the quirky personalized coasters. the postcard that comes with your bill. the pretty orange peel zest. \n\nSynopsis: 5 stars. I loved everything about this place. Yes, more than both Ball & Biscuit and Black Market.  Easily.  If you enjoy quality cocktails in a mature, urbane setting, this will quickly become a new favorite... I know I'll be a regular at The Libertine.",

  "text": "I think I've heard of this place a long time ago but it just escaped my mind to ever visit. I'm always up for food so I ventured there recently.\n\nThe menu wasn't what I expected. I made sure to check it out online first because it takes me forever and a day to figure out what to eat.\n\nMy plan was to get the hummus and pita. I love that. My party ended up skipping appetizers and just going straight to the entrees. \n\nI got the tilapia +spinach+rich. The other got the chicken and waffles (I yet to try that combo anywhere) and the meatloaf.\nSince I vowed to cut down my alcohol I got the peach non-alcoholic fizzy drink. \n\nThe tilapia was encrusted with pistachio crumbs. I enjoyed it but towards the end, something about it became  nauseating. Maybe it was pistachios overkill..maybe the semisweet butter sauce surrounding the spinach and rice. Either way, towards the end I lost interest and ate the rest as fast as I could just so I can say I finished it.\n\nFor dessert we shared the brownie and ice cream (meant for 2-4 people). It was quite large  and it was good but not great.  I wouldn't get it again. \n\nThe restaurant as a whole was okay. Nothing special I'd say.",

  "text": "A lunch time staple in Ucity! What I love about this location is that there is plenty seating and the decor is very cool. It's casual but comfy with vertical gardens. Lovely. \n\nMy number 1 fave is absolutely the Udon noodle salad. The combo is just awesome between the salty peanuts, arugula, noodles, cabbage and glazed chick'n with a hint of sweetness from the chinnese black bean dressing. Other faves include  the crispy hipcity ranch, the fajita wrap and of course the sweet potato fries. I'm a cilantro black bean dip gal with the fries and it's to die for though the sriracha aioli is also pretty delicious. \n\nIn the summer, I'm all about the groothie as well. It's a perfect way to enjoy lots of fruits and veggies in one delicious smoothie. So refreshing on a hot day! \n\nYes the pricing is a bit high but they strive to use all organic and locally sourced ingredients and all of their packaging is compostable so I get it and I'm ok with it. If you enjoy plant based foods, definitely check it out!",

  "text": "I cannot vouch for the importance of the collection here, but there is something simultaneously calming and stimulating about this place, and I end up finding myself here some weekends just killing time, sitting around, taking it in.  I really like the floor plan, and I love the programs they offer, the movies at the Toby, the Lilly House, and the grounds, including the 100 Acres.  And even though I support the museum through membership, I am really so, so happy that they do not charge an admission.  I am not always sure this city is very supportive of the arts, so the IMA's decision to open its doors to the general public was very welcome.\n\nAll that being said, when I visited last weekend, the contemporary art section was a little ragged -- two exhibits were out of order, one was shut down (to make room for an upcoming exhibit?  I don't know).  It definitely needed some sprucing up.",

  "text": "I agree with my real-life friend pre-Yelp and pre-FB about this place. And I just looked over the other reviews. There is ABSOLUTELY something rotten in the state of Denmark here. The slew of 1 star reviews are by people who have from 1 to 3 reviews total. One was a flat out fake and one by a Montecito resident I personally know who is quite possibly mentally ill/delusional.Sadly, he got 25 notes on this review as he's a writer and funny. \n\nI forgot about it for awhile, living on the border of Montecito and SB and staying mostly on Coast Village Road. \n\nI had a great brunch here last year, trying the butternut squash pizza with the crinkly sage (flash fried I think), goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil . Sublime! \n\nThe new bartender , Hannah, is terrific and knows her wines. She told me the Riesling was too sweet for her and that if I liked less sweet Riesling, I'd not be happy. I tried a Sauvignon when I picked up my to go pizza and liked it so much I ended up staying for another. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, when Piatti closed, my boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner and I remember the succotash side fondly along with a soup and appetizer but don't remember what it was specially, but definitely one of us had fish. \n\nPiatti was, well, Piatti. The best thing about it was the decor and the 7/glass Piatti cab, along with that bread basket with the chili /balsamic dipping sauce. A good budget meal with the 7/glass wine and a soup or appetizer. \n\nBut Piatti was underwhelming and probably lasted as long as it did for sentimental reasons. \n\nThe Wine Bistro is far superior both in terms of food and overall experience. We love that side room with the little fire but the  main room is nice as well. \n\nThe clientele is pretty much the same, lots of Montecito locals and longtime residents. \n\nI will come back soon, at least for a drink and appetizer. The sides are terrific and if you want to keep the bill down, wine by the glass and a couple sides is the way to go.",

When I have inquired about sold out or missing items I have received apologies in return and also told I can call the store before driving in to see if they have particular items in stock.

I love the Latin inspired menu and the fact that you can order half sizes of the richer entrees. We split a Cuban Toast and the Breakfast Tacos. I had never heard of breakfast tacos before so we were intrigued. They are each wrapped in 2 tortillas and generously filled with  an eggs, salsa, guac mixture. \nThe Cuban toast had walnuts sprinkled on it and was great also. It's made in condensed milk and was rich and sweet. \nI also ordered a Cafe Olla which I loved! Id go back just for that coffee. It's a cafe with I think nutmeg, orange, and some spices and topped with whip cream. I didn't need to add any cream or sugar. It was pretty and different and tasted great. \nThe service was very friendly and our waiter was helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations. I would def recommend this place and will be back with the husband!",

We arrived at 530 and were immediately told it was a 1-2 hour wait. \n\nIt pains me that this restaurant does not take reservations. We were cool waiting for a table but I could see this being an ass ache for out of towners or people looking to celebrate a special event. I really hope they change this soon. \n\nWhile we were waiting we had a few appetizers and some drinks. The Hangry snacks were a hit. I love their homemade salsas. It elevated the tortilla chips. The scallop aguachile was also amazing. The fresh flavours were a nice contrast to the chips and salsa. \n\nOnce we were seated we dove in for an epic meal. We gorged on the rotisserie for 4 with a side of cauliflower and vegetables. The runs on the meat packed so much flavour. The roasted potatoes were heavenly. The sides truly elevated the whole meal. Meat sweats? Yes! And it felt so good. \n\nAfter a few more libations we decided that our stomachs didn't feel complete with dessert. So naturally we ordered their amazing churros, the pastel de tres leches and some apple pie thing. Soooooo goooood! \n\nIf you want to eat and drink like a king one night. Go here. If you want a good experience in a setting met for conversations and unifying friendships. Go here. \n\nThey will not disappoint.",

Each exhibit grows with the children. There were things for the 1 1/2 year old to do, different things for the 4 year old, and on and on as the kids grow.\n\nI want to go back without the kids so I can spend more time exploring on my own.

They have everything from simple food (my personal favorites #1 or #9 -- if you really want food coma) to chicken and waffles to their signature sandwiches at the bottom of the menu; all their food is unfathomable. \n\nEnvironment: Usually I'm particular but because of the \"old-school West Philadelphia environment\" they steal the stage away with its appropriate location and \"local West Philly\" vibe.\n\nService: We happened to come with 6 people initially, then 2 more 15 min later, then 2 more another 10 min later.

  "text": "Keyword: Authentic, Northern Thai, Unique \n\nI believe the above word define this restaurant. They are the best Thai now in my book in the Bay Area. This restaurant just open less than a month but it does have all the unique food that you will not find any where. One thing I have to warn you is their food is spicy when you have the chef select the medium hot. For me I like very hot. \n\nThey serve street food that only can be found in the northern kingdom of Siam - Khao Soi. This is a unique dish that only this restaurant have it. The  dish include crispy and egg noodle with chicken in coconut milk curry. The chicken include the breast and chicken drumsticks. \n\nThey also serve Pla Koong that I like. I have this dish when I am in Miami from an authentic Thai restaurant. I have try many Thai restaurant but non have come close. Now I found my favorite again. This is broil shrimps in very spicy mixed of lemony base spices. It include lemon grass and kefir lime leave. Yum. Very spicy. Love it. \n\nWe also order the crispy duck in basil leave. The spice they use is difficult to describe. Very good dish. We order a drunken noodle. But this time the noodle is too soggy. I have this noodle at their lunch before and it is better. We also order another northern Thai  - ginger curry. It is pork shoulder in long hours braised cooking. This is a sweet dish. For the rice you can order the white rice or the sticky rice. I never thought the sticky rice go very well with curry. \n\nI hope all yelper make an extra mile to support new and unique restaurant. The menu is still evolving since they can cook many northern dishes of the Thai cuisine. This restaurant do not serve alcohol but they allow you BYOB. I brought my sake. Very convenient and saving.",

Especially when I found out it was a burgers and shakes kind of place. I've already been to its sister restaurants: Chocolate Bar, the Bridge, & Rooster, so my expectations were high... and yes, as with all Bailey's establishments, Bailey's Range exceeded my expectations.\n\nFor a Saturday afternoon, there was plenty of seating. I love the rustic decor. The service was friendly. My fiance and I ordered the\" American\" to split. The description alone won us over: beef patty, fried mac 'n cheese patty, bacon, house sauce, and sriracha mayo. A perfect combination of flavors. Almost makes me wish I ordered my own instead of splitting... but the fries definitely made up for it. We ordered fries with the \"rooster\" sauce, which was a must!\n\nFor drinks, I ordered the Crown Valley Peachie Wit, which was FRUITY DELICIOUSNESS. I got the 9 oz, instead of the 16 oz, but then ended up ordering two 9 oz. Highly recommended. My fiance got the Sweet Sweet Bacon shake, which was a combination of maker's mark, candied bacon, salted caramel ice cream, but Sweet Sweet Bacon was NOT so sweet, it was TOO salty for our taste. The waitress was nice about it, so my fiance replaced it with an horchata shake (and I LOVE horchata)..so RumChata, vodka, and cinnamon ice cream made this 10x better.\n\nMy only thing that I thought was strange were the bathrooms. There were shared \"closet\" bathrooms and then it was a \"communal\" sink, but no big deal, they were clean.\n\nYes, Bailey's Range, I will be back.",

When I saw this morning that they dropped it to $29.95, I was sold!\n\nNow, let me start by saying that they did decrease the size of the buffet to make the price better.  Honestly, still an amazing buffet.  You get a full on buffet as well as about 20 different small plates to choose from, which they bring out quickly and with no issue.  My favorite part of this brunch:  unlimited mimosas and bloody marys, which they do not skimp on!  I won't go into the details of all of the food, but I will say...it was allllllllllll good!\n\nLocated right on Rocky Point, it is a lovely spot to look out and take in the beauty of the Tampa water and after a few mimosas you will be feeling quite happy!",

  "text": "This spot was our jam back in the day when it was Kildares. On a tour of of old haunts in honor of my husband's recent birthday we decided to stop by despite being a bit super partial to the old residents. We were actually quite impressed with the renovations and the new vibes! \n\nThe place is super hip and obviously inspired by music. I loved the photos of my old pals Janis and Jimi downstairs, and certainly the guitars and old school blues concert posters on the walls upstairs in the \"juke joint\". \n\nWe came for date night and enjoyed live music by  Big Soul Chicken band. (Check their site for a listing of upcoming performers.)They were awesome and played their original tunes as well as classics we all know and love. Perfect place to come whether you want it as background music or more of a concert/dancing type of night. \n\n While the \"juke joint\" wasn't nearly as nitty and gritty as the authentic ones I've been to on the back roads in Mississippi and in the south in general, it certainly gave me a bit of that area I desire from time to time. There's not enough live music places in the city in my opinion. Let alone free to enter ones! This place is a great find! \n\nIt's super groovy, dark and sexy feeling up in the juke joint. Lots of candles and even a fireplace. Perfect for a night out with my love! \n\nThe cocktails were awesome and ran about $26 for two before gratuity. We chose the Lynchburg Basil Lemonade (Jack Daniels, Fresh Basil, Homemade Southern Lemonade) and the Black Cherry Gimlet (Black Cherry Vodka, Vanilla, Lime, maraschino Cherry). I honestly cannot choose a favorite! Both were carefully crafted, alcohol filled and absolutely delicious! Whiskey and Bourbon are obviously their specialty and I really loved the barrels scattered about doubling as side tables! The beer list was rather extensive also! \n\nThe menu, like the entire place, is influenced by the South. They have a late night menu, kids menu, brunch, lunch and dinner. We can't wait to return perhaps for brunch with the kids or \"social hour\" as they call it. There's daily specials during that 5-7pm period with $4 wines, $3 brews and $4-$6 smaller plates. The mushroom and kale salads were calling my name and the crawfish Mac and cheese sounds right up hub's alley. \n\nSuper fun find!! \nKiosk parking. Lots of spots. There's also an hourly lot under Abbots Square.",

The space is really open and attractive.\n\nThe food was good and the prices were inexpensive compared to other Vietnamese places. And the food is more traditional than some of the other spots uptown/garden district. \n\nI had veggie avocado spring rolls and they were perfect. My Mom had a small pho (which was huge for her) and she really enjoyed it. I also had the bun with tofu and it was OK. \n\nThere were definitely regulars who must be in all the time since they were greeted and asked if they wanted their usual dishes, which I would appreciate if I were a regular. The porch seating seemed to be dog friendly too.\n\nThe steps were a bit steep and my Mom did struggle with them a little but she had been walking all over the place for a few hours.",

  "text": "The three and a half stars this place has right now is about right. \n\nI can't say it's a three, because it has some menu items that are tasty and different than other breakfast/brunch restaurants and is not a diner. I also can't say they've sold me on a four, and it's for sure not the \"Best Breakfast in Town.\" \n\nI'm giving this place a four because the Bloody Mary I had was delicious and my server was extremely friendly and helpful. I also thoroughly enjoyed the toasted mini baguette that came with my corned beef hash in place of the English Muffin. The corned beef hash was decent, but not the best, and while I ordered my eggs over medium because I dislike having any runny white part, one of my eggs was not runny in the yellow part either, which I would have loved to sop up with my yummy baguette. \n\nThis place is BUSY on the weekend. We went pretty late brunch, around 11, and still had to wait around 5-10 minutes to get a decent table. They attempted to sit us at a table awkwardly positioned next to where both servers pass by and the patrons stand to pay. We opted out of that one and waited a little longer for them to clean off a table in the side dinning area. The patio was packed and loud, and about half way through our meal a group of loud college boys were sat near us, which sped us through the second half of our meal.",

  "text": "Oh Momo's where to start....this was my first time here. My siblings many times here. Service was not as great as expected. We saw our server a couple times. Others had brought our food out. I would rate this establishment as a 2.5 if that was an option. \n\nWhat we ordered...\n\nRoasted Red Pepper Hummus: absolutely delicious! The best hummus I've had in awhile! The bread was nice and warm. Downfall, they should provide more pita. \n\nGrilled octopus: first bite was good. Second bite wasn't so sure. Third bite...I just wanted to throw up. I love octopus but and this was something different....perhaps spoiled octopus? The only dish that just sat there because no one could eat it. \n\nBacon Phyllo: I love phyllo in general, the people in my party do too! The description is BACON phyllo...and non of us were able to taste the bacon at all!\n\nLobster Mac n Cheese: we all enjoy this dish! Way super creamy and cheesy with chunks of lobster! Yum! For the dish we expected the noodles to be a little softer for Mac n cheese style. \n\nTraditional Gyro: this gyro was absolutely delicious! We all enjoyed this very much! A matter of fact it we killed this dish before all other food lol. The meat is very flavorful. And all the veggies and tzatiki were superb! \n\nOverall, some food was good, some was ehh. What bothered me the most was that there's a trash can right next to the soda machine with ice. The ice was not covered. The trash was next to it. I saw employees throw trash in it and some bounced off into the ice. Yuck! And very unsanitary.",

It is very quaint and cute inside, the staff is all very friendly. The owner immediately greeted us after we were sat and brought a coloring book and crayons for our two year old daughter. The menu is on the small side but i kinda prefer it that way since it limits me from getting overwhelmed by too many choices. We ordered the special of the day, the banana nut bread pancakes for the little one although they were so delicious I think we ate most of them. I had the meat lovers omelet which was amazing and my husband had a custom egg order and potatoes. All of the food was fresh and so good! We love this spot and will be back regularly.",

The decor is very simple and elegant, making the place feel nice and clean.\n\nMy spouse and I came here with another couple for breakfast, arriving around 9am on a Saturday. Parking can be a little difficult in the area, but there is a parking garage right next to Whitebox. When we arrived, there was still plenty of seating at the restaurant. You order at the counter and your food is brought out to your table.\n\nI wasn't terribly hungry, so I got the steel-cut oatmeal, and my spouse had the Florentine Omelet. My oatmeal came with fresh berries, but I felt like they skimped a little on the berries. Basically two strawberries and a few blueberries on top of a bowl of oatmeal. However, I did really enjoy the few bites omelet I had. I loved the artichoke in the omelet, I don't see that too often.\n\nAll in all, a great breakfast spot with fresh and tasty food.",

The ricotta  \"schmear\" smothered the toasted bagette slice so much that the bread tasted soggy and stale. It was way too much. I sampled my friend's potato pizza and it was so disappointing. I highly anticpated this since I love potatoes so much but the truffle oil overpowered instead of highlighting the dish.\n\nMy friend's brussel spouts smelled like feet- this made my experience even more miserable. I really thought someone took off their shoes ( I know , I know, they're supposed to smell like that- they could have toned them down somehow though!)\n\nI have always enjoyed the bar and the selection of beers they have and would return again for that anyday but I think I'll skip the dining experience.",

We found the staff to be friendly and helpful with all of our requests. The kitchen staff even remembered my two year old's likes and dislikes at breakfast! \n\nWe arrived and realized that our room didn't have the tub that we requested at check in, but the front desk employee quickly changed our room and put us in the back building (which was actually better for us - considering the kiddo - a bit more isolated) and apologized for the confusion.  \n\nWe enjoyed our private patio feature and he large bathroom.  I also appreciated the amenities provided in our room.  Make-up remover was a nice thing to have provided in the room (though they stopped replacing it half way through our stay) and we also enjoyed the option of being able to bike places (as the hotel provided bike rentals).  My only complaint about the amenities is that they seemed to stop replenishing things towards the end of our stay (didn't replace shower caps, make-up remover, soap or tissues in the bathroom the last two days).  \n\nI thought the provided breakfast was a a pretty good quality of food and we never had a problem getting seated or asking for substitutions to our dishes (though we do not have any allergies) and everyone was friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend and stay again.",

Bacchanal has also become much more well known so you have to get there earlier if you want a table. There were 11 of us that went and we got there about 1:30 pm on a Saturday and had no trouble getting 2 tables. We proceeded to get wine and beer and go to town for about 5 hours. Around 3:00 pm all the tables were full and by 4:00 pm when the band started it was standing room only. The vibe of this place is fantastic, you are pretty much in paradise as far as I am concerned and I would have spent all night there too if everyone didn't want to go elsewhere.

  "text": "Are you looking for a nice hotel in Philadelphia?  Well look no further.  This is your dream hotel.  YOUR DREAM HOTEL, I TELL YOU!\n\nI have wanted to stay here for years, and back in the days when I lived in Philly I would often walk by and think \"what could I do to justify a stay here even though I live walking distance away?\"  That moment arose when my husband and I came to town for a friend's wedding and their hotel room block was at the Hotel Monaco.  Sure, it was still expensive (a place this swanky comes with a price tag!) but I told my husband that we basically had no choice but to live it up for the night and book a room.  Carpe diem.\n\nWe walked in and it was glamour from the very first second.  Everything is just gorgeous and impeccably decorated.  The customer service is unbelievable.  All I could think was \"don't slip up, Jessica, pretend you're classy!\"  We got to our room and holy cow.... who decorated?!  Don't get me wrong - I loved every square inch of it.  We found \"loud\" wallpaper, a pillow with an adorable quote, a perfectly propped up book of Alice and Wonderland, and the coolest bright red TV stand / media center that I have ever seen.  In the closet were robes (including a leopard print one) and a yoga mat (whattttt).  The bed was unbelievably comfortable and we had the most luxurious night's sleep.  And the bathtub came with bath salts so that you could really soak and relax (I didn't utilize this but it was tempting).  The ONLY thing that could have made our room better was if we had a cool view (some people I know had an incredible view of Independence Hall).  We had kind of a semi-view (ok, this is a stretch) of the Liberty Bell.  But this should tell you how great the location is - you are RIGHT in Old City.  You step outside and BOOM it's Independence Hall.  We had 45 minutes to kill and went on a guided tour of Congress Hall with no problem.  You can go to the Liberty Bell, the Betsy Ross House, the Constitution Center, or the American Jewish Museum (among about a million other cool places) without needing to hail a cab or set foot on a subway.  \n\nThe two annoying things (well, one is actually kind of cool).  The first: parking was something like $43 a night.  I mean, I get it - you're in downtown Philly in the most touristy neighborhood in the whole city.  But no way, Jose.  Fortunately I know Philly well and we found free street parking in the Grad Hospital neighborhood and took an Uber to the hotel (for about $7 each way).  Second: Lil Jon was in the house.  Seriously.  There was some type of late night event with Lil Jon as a DJ up at the roof top bar.  When we caught a cab back late at night after the wedding was over there was like a whole swarm of people trying to prevent us from crashing the Lil Jon party.  There was even some guy who looked like Secret Service blocking us from going up one of the elevators because that was, like, the Lil Jon party only elevator.  Cool your jets, I don't want to party with Lil Jon that bad.  (I mean I kind of do but you know.)\n\nCome here, stay here, feel glamorous, check out Philly tourist traps, learn a little history, wear a leopard print robe, read Alice in Wonderland, and maybe party with Lil Jon.  This place rocks.",

He brought a sashimi appetizer, gyoza, tuna with avocado & ponzu sauce (EXCELLENT), a selection of maki (there was a special monster roll with soft shell crab on top that was great), then finally a selection of sashimi. It's not exactly what we would've ordered had we just done it ourselves, but everything was delicious and we each ended up paying around $25.

The design is much more open and more conducive to bringing people to and through the center core.\n\nNow that Locale Market has opened for business I expect the flow of people day and night will definitely increase. More traffic means more vitality.\n\nThree restaurants on the second floor will be opening in 2015. Farm Table Kitchen which is the upstairs dining component to Locale Market. Ruth's Chris Steak House will bring a nationally known brand to the mix and Sea Salt, which is expanding from its original location in Naples, Florida, should bring additional attention and spark to Sundial's dining options.\n\nBut the retail mix to date just does not do much for me because I can either find the same shops elsewhere - Tommy Bahama, Chico's and Lululemon athletic clothing - or the new-to-the-market or locally owned shops are limited in what they offer.\n\nThis is a lovely complex in the center of a lively downtown that should become a destination for food but also for other reasons that encourage spending time and spending money. Here's hoping the retail can be amped up enough to shine just as brightly as its neighboring foodie-focused businesses.",

  "text": "I went to this store to experience the famous Blue Bell ice cream. My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, \"Best on the earth,\" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. \n\nThe Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.",

However, the service we received was atrocious.  I'd cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor's note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn't sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.  Overall, the food was a 4+, but the service brought my rating down.  I felt like we got one of the only people on Bourbon St. NOT having a good time.",

The pool alone deserves its own review. Lovely, lovely views and two jacuzzis along with a poolside bar makes me -- and others -- very happy. And you can rent out a cabana and get the special treatment. I like that you are actually able to close each of the drapes in the cabanas and have nearly full privacy. \n\nSo, this casino is still relatively new. It opened November 11, 2011. What that means is that you don't walk into the place and find that your entire body is cutting the cigarette smoke and smoke residue. \n\nYou know what I'm saying. \n\nHave you ever been in one of those old timey casinos? Maybe in Vegas? You walk in and the cigarette smoke is so thick you can literally feel it on your skin, sitting on your eyelashes and glazing your eyeballs? \n\nBleeccchhhhttt!!!\n\nMoving on in the review. \n\nSo, yes -- everything is still shiny. And they have some very nice restaurants. I like Mr. Ans and PY the best of the, what, five restaurants they have here. Also, the bar areas are very nice. Trusted there is absolutely no way to get away from the clanks, dings and swirling sounds from the machines. That's OK. Just come along with a date or someone you are so entralled with and you will never notice. \n\nBut -- what?! No taste on the wine?! Fail! Also, the room service can be so, so slow sometimes. But some of the other positives make up for it. \n\nSo, yes -- I enjoy this spot and look forward to my next night over.",

Throw me an apologetic smile or something once in awhile. \nSo when I went over the weekend and waited 20 mins only to get completely dismissed by the barista when I asked for her help in figuring out why I was so waiting for croissants, I was thoroughly disappointed.  When I apologized for interrupting HER and kindly asked if she could help, she offered nothing and said to me \"oh i don't do warming station, my shift supervisor does.\" And that was it, you can imagine my frustration.  I hate leaving a bad review but she didn't even yell for someone. Or point to someone. Or anything. Not cool. \nSo when I did find my person, she said the ticket never printed then walked away. Then 30 seconds later came back with a bag of my food. She said it was accidentally left at the drive thru window. The end. It had been sitting there for awhile..and I'd been waiting for 20 mins. \nFrankly, I want to give a lower star but because I received excellent service from a kid the day before who normally worked at a different store...

  "text": "Trident never disappoints for me.  It's going to largely be bar cuisine but I find it quite delightful.  I go here not when I'm in the mood for something healthy (though the Paleo Bowl would fulfill that if  you are looking for something healthy) I go here when I went delicious bar food.\n\nIf you like regular nachos, the kind with real melted cheese (not fake cheese sauce), these are some of the best you can get.  They're nothing crazy, no unique twist, just damn good nachos.  If you want fancier nachos, try elsewhere.  But here is going to be one of your best options for straight up regular delicious nachos.  The half portion is more than sufficient for one person.  I cannot even imagine trying to tackle the full portion. I'm a vegetarian so I never get it with beef, but you can totally add a meat option should you wish.\n\nAlso delicious is their mac and cheese.  It's so cheesy, never dried out, and always has some nice cheese melted right on top.  You can get it as a side with many of their burgers, or you can order the entrée sized.  And in my opinion, you can never go wrong by adding green chiles to the mac and cheese.  Because green chilis are a gift.\n\nI love their caprese appetizer as well.  Standard mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic.  But it's always tasty.  Same with the mozzarella sticks.  Their white bean hummus plate is also delicious.\n\nThe other thing I love about trident is they do what, in my opinion, all restaurants with burgers should do, they say at the top you can take any burger and substitute a veggie patty.  It's baffling to me how many places don't even offer a veggie burger at all (they're frozen!  not that hard to keep them stocked!) or if they do, they're hesitant or unwilling to accommodate a request to add it to a different burger than the one veggie burger listed on the menu.  Why in the world, if you already have veggie patties on hand, do I have to order the ONE veggie burger you have listed?  Why can't I just substitute the veggie patty onto any other option?  It drives me bonkers.  But for Trident, this is never the case!  The mushroom swiss looks good to you?  They'll make it with a veggie patty.  The green chile burger looks great?  They'll make it a veggie.  Etc., etc., etc.  It's a standard Boca Burger, which are ok.  Normally I avoid Boca Burgers, but Trident makes me excited to eat a veggie burger!  I recommend the Green Chile with a Boca Burger, and add a fried egg.  Side salad and no bun if you want low carb.  Or, if you're indulging, side of mac & cheese.\n\nFor non-vegetarians, my friends are always happy to eat here too.  Popular choices among my friends include the grilled shrimp skewers, the non-veggie burgers, the crispy shrimp po-boy, and the paleo bowl.\n\nThey also have a fully stocked bar.  Good prices on their beverages.  And the wait staff has always been friendly and kind.\n\nWord of caution, if there's football on, it's probably going to be crowded here.  So plan accordingly.",

  "text": "I was staying downtown for work, and I needed to grab lunch before a meeting.  I walked into Sun Diner, a pretty new spot at the time, because there aren't a ton of restaurants downtown with awesome reviews.  This one looked intriguing, and I love breakfast food any time of day.  I loved the decor and layout!  Really fitting for Music City, delightfully retro.  Most of the seating is at the counter, which is casual and laid back.  \n\nThe food was pretty good.  I had a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes surprised me because there were sweet ones in the mix, not bad.  I got the wrong tea from my server at first, but it was corrected pretty easily.  Prices are on par for downtown, touristy Nashville.  Steep but expected.\n\nMy one complaint is that I had to pay at the register, which is located by the door, and there just isn't much space there if there's a line.  I kept bumping into people entering the restaurant while I waited.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a safe bet when you're downtown, and I think it would taste even better at 3am.  After all, it's a 24-hour diner!",

The calamari is the best calamari I've had in quite some time. Perfectly crisp, not rubbery, full of flavor. Yum.\n\nFor dessert? I had the Duncan Hines slice of yellow cake and glass of milk. Genius.\n\nWe came back AGAIN a few weeks ago when a friend was visiting from LA. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The husband had the Halibut. Our friend had the Roast Beef Dinner. Our friend won when it came to food selection. My belly was so warm and happy after one bite of his roast beef. The meat was succulent, juicy, the perfect medium rare. The mashed taters were creamy with a slight hint of garlic. Mmmm.\n\nI preferred my husband's halibut over my tuna. The tuna was good, but the halibut had more flavor, IMO.\n\nCan't wait to go back again. Yum yum yum.",

I needed to be drunk to really appreciate the grease. Since it was my first venture I'll say its worth a try, but buyer beware they're super heavy for being small balls of dough. \n\nThe curry chicken I had was a bit disappointing.

I'm used to doing brunch in places where eggs and cheese and breakfast meats and sweet treats like french toast over flow on your plate. \n\nIt's not that the servings at Ants Pants are skimpy, far from it, but I don't leave there feeling like I overdid it or won't eat again for days. I also love that some of the menu items are slightly unusual or interesting. My favorite is the bacon stack; (which gets a thumbs up just in name alone), a delicious piece of thick toasted bread topped with a fried egg, bacon. arugula and shaved pecorino. This tastes like something my Mom used to make for us when we were little, it was late Spring and the garden had started to produce the yummiest greens I've ever eaten.   \n\nThe other nice thing about Ants Pants is that it is easy walking distance from center city, but far enough west that you will be able to find parking on Sunday morning.

You can pretty much name your pasta and your sauce and get it there.  Every lunch (and I'm assuming dinner) comes with a house salad that has an AMAZING balsamic vinaigrette.  I would have ordered that salad as a meal it was so good.  I got gnocchi with fresh diced tomatoes, and she got fettucine with bolognese sauce.  We both loved our meals and left with doggie bags for later.  \n\nI've been told that Fellini's is owned by the same person who owns Trattoria Giuseppe down the street in Newtown Square, and I have had an equally positive experience there.

Forget that the \"specials\" food items may not be the perfect temp.  Accept that they will offer neither the best table service nor attentive hosting.  Assume cramped seating and unforgiving table sizes if you choose to dine in or out front.  Oh, and prepare yourself for zero condiments available at your table too.  If you can handle those things, then come in for a simple weekday dinner that is altogether different and affordable.  \n\nWe all loved the chicken soup.  It makes you thirsty, but at the same time contains chopped up bone-in chicken so my daughter could learn the flavor benefits of marrow to brothy soups.  More refined restaurants will hide this fact by removing those pieces and charging double.  \n\nThe roast pork smothered in red beans and sauce served over a bed of yellow rice disappeared quickly and filled me up for $6.  It was seasoned enough to appease my need for hot sauce while simultaneously not requiring a glass of water for sodium balance.\n\nWe all thought the tamales were odd and represented the low point of the meal, but then again we are from Chicago and Tom Tom Tamales definitely represent a less ambiguous approach to this dish.  Covering lukewarm corn based mush in a lukewarm corn based wrap is not what we expected.  \n\nBut I digress...\n\nIt would be great if I could gush over everything we experienced, however the truth is you should come here.

The Mac and cheese that came with the platter tasted a little stale though, but as a side dish it worked out okay. I would recommend getting the roti instead - it comes out hot, with a substantial filling, and is really satisfying to eat. \n\nWould love to come back to try the juices or pastries - they have a pretty big assortment on the menu!",

  "text": "This delicious ramen really warmed me up! I had the miso ramen and I loved the flavor profile of the broth. The noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory. I also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special (add an app for $4). I was not a huge fan; even with lime juice sprinkled on the top, the fry on the wings was too heavy for me; I wonder if they were twice-fried? While I appreciated the crispiness, I would pass on these the next time around. I would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12:15; they only have 4 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and then the seats at the bar. However, this is a great place to come for a solid bowl of ramen, especially if it's cold outside.",

Honestly, I was not expecting much since the place definitely has that minimalist, we-do-one-thing-great-and-that's-pizza vibe, but it was awesome!

  "text": "Albasha is a total hidden gem!! Do not let the sketchy appearance of this restaurant fool you because you would be missing out on some truly delicious Greek/Lebanese cuisine. I didn't realize this was a franchise until I checked out their website, but it seems like just a Louisiana franchise. I don't eat Greek food too often but I've been craving it a lot more frequently lately. I dined here for an impromptu dinner with some friends one night and loved everything we ordered.\n\nFirst of all, their portions are HUGE, so I'd recommend sharing if you're not starving. Two people can easily share one entree and be full. We split an appetizer of the lamb hummus to start with which turned out to be a great idea. The hummus was probably one of the best I've had. I was initially hesitant to order the lamb with it because I was worried it would be dry or overcooked but it was perfect and I could really taste the lamb. The pita served with it tasted fresh and hot and our server was quick to refill our basket when we ran low.\n\nFor my entree, I order the beef kabob platter and it was DELISH. It came with a green salad sprinkled with feta, rice, huge beef kabobs, more pita and more hummus - I probably could have skipped the appetizer hummus but oh well. Our server had asked me how I wanted my beef cooked, medium rare, and it came out perfectly medium rare (You never really know). It was also very tender and juicy. I picked at my bf's gyro plate and it was sooo good! The other couple we were with also really enjoyed their food. One of our friends ordered a vegetarian plate, so it's nice that they offer vegetarian options.\n\nMust go back to sample the grape leaves and falafel. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I really wanted to order these but there's absolutely no way I would have been able to finish it all. The moral of this review is definitely do not judge a book by it's cover.",

This location is great, friendly staff always clean and a fun place to shop.\n\n\nTJ's is crazy different from any other grocery store and most people don't know!\nA few things about Trader Joes:\n\n1. Everything with the Trader Joe's Logo is \n-GMO FREE\n-Has No artificial Coloring\n-Has No artificial Preservatives\n\n2.You can try anything is the store!! As long as it doesn't have to be heated (frozen meals etc) you can bring it to the sample station and they will open it for you to try!! I'm talking Cheese, juice, fruits, ice cream, yogurt, chips, protein bars, cereals, candy..anything!\n\n3. They are always sampling items!! While most stores do this for you to buy things (of course they want you to buy it too) Trader Joe's actually wants you to try something you normally would never buy.  They have so many unique and different foods, this lets you try something you may have never even seen in the store before.\n\n4. They always have new products!! This is good and bad, because if you are a fan of a seasonal item you have to stock up when you see it.  Not only do they have certain items that come out seasonally but they are always introducing new items every week.  They even have a New Item Shelf that you can check out so you don't miss anything.  Again though the down side is they are a small store and if certain items don't sell great you may never see them again.\n\n5. You can return anything, no questions asked!  They want you to try new things and if you don't like it just bring back the receipt or an empty wrapper and they will refund you on the spot.  It's also good if something you buy spoils fast.\n\n6. Every store has a mascot (a stuffed animal) the staff hides it everyday so that kids can look for it.  When you find it, go to the sample station for your free Lolipop.  Its a great idea and a great way to keep kids occupied as parents shop.\n\nThose are just some of the main things that set TJ's apart.  It is such a fun and colorful store to be in.  Everyone that works there is always in a good mood and there is always someone around to help you.",

I had everything that a guest would want from a large clean room with a flat screen TV with lots of channels to a pool and fitness center. The room we got was huge and had a couch in it, a mini fridge, great a/c (a must in FL. when it's hot), a coffee maker with coffee, and a complimentary breakfast. The breakfast consisted of bread, bagels, mini muffins and danishes, fruit, juice, fresh bananas, apples, and oranges, coffee, tea, various cereals, oatmeal, and milk. They serve breakfast until 9:30. \n\nThey also have free wi-fi and the place is within walking distance to CVS and a few restaurants and a deli. If you don't have a car to get around and are stuck there, you don't have to walk far to get something if you'd rather not order room service or if you happened to forget to bring something like deodorant. \n\nAlso, the staff is nice and friendly. The room service menu has limited options, but I won't knock them down any stars for that. The price for our room was booked through a hotel site, I can't recall which one, but we got this huge luxurious room for only $89.00-:D I also loved the fact that I had the pool all to myself most of the time which was a big surprise to me. I guess since we were there mostly during the weekdays, it wasn't as busy. We'd go back here again if we ever go back to FL. for future business trips.",

  "text": "Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called \"One\". In the lyrics, it stated, \"One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do\". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. \n\nNot once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. \n\nThe second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a \"limited menu\". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, \"no\".  I ate else where that day. \n\nWhat I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?\n\nI understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option. \n\nDisclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity.",

The appetizers were the best - the peking duck roll was good as was the foie gras roll, but the lobster dumpling was basically a dried husk.

I got the Southern Belle cocktail to drink - honeysuckle vodka, fresh peach juice - OMG, to die for. One of the best cocktails I've had. My chicken melted in my mouth it was so succulent and tender. Oh, and the goat cheese grits for an appetizer? Wheel me away and bury me. I could have died right there and been happy.\n\nAmbiance and decor were great as well. I didn't sit outside, but from what I could tell the little patio area looked lovely. \n\nCan't wait to come back next time I'm in Nashville!",

Our waitress was attentive and we always had enough coffee (very important).  I love the menu because most of the items aren't too heavy.  For breakfast I got the fruit crepes covered with yogurt, which came with a muffin.  These were delicious! I can tell you that I will want to come back for these.  My husband got the avocado toast. WOW! That alone was worth 5 stars.  I want to know where they find their avocados?!  My dad got one of the hash meals and my mom got oatmeal with marinated berries.  It was all great and very reasonably priced.  Everyone was happy with what they got and would return.",

  "text": "They lose a star for having TWO STORES on essentially the same road...one on the far northeast side and one on the far northwest side. Really, Trader Joe? Your stores are all over the place in other cities, like Chicago, DC, San Francisco......but southside Indy gets ZERO...downtown Indy NONE. That's not cool, Joe. Not cool at all. \n\nHowever, the employees are pretty useful and cool (and sometimes even funny). The food is affordable. I like that it doesn't take me 15 minutes to get through the store because it's petite. LOVE the products. Once I got a spoiled piece of salmon, and they cheerfully refunded me and I didn't have to bring back the gross fish. I like the free samples (last night I had a bite of pumpkin pie). LOVE that I can have a cheese party without going broke. Their low-budget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends aren't super snobby about booze. \n\nKefir, non-dairy milks, organic products, cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores. Their frozen foods are very good and the MorningStar Farms sausage links' everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores. \n\nI am particularly fond of the somewhat-strange party snacks, although they are much pricier than at Saraga. \n\nTrader Joe's is a great place to find food to \"cheat\" with if you're not much of a cook or are pressed for time. For example, you can buy an already-seasoned tri-tip to use for your steak fajitas. You can find pre-marinated chicken to put on the grill. They also sell many pre-cooked foods that you just have to microwave...if you can't cook at all. \n\nIn conclusion, start writing letters, people! We need a downtown Trader Joe's! It isn't fair that so many of us (including students, who want nothing more than to eat healthy) have to drive 30 minutes each way to get groceries!",

  "text": "The dancing bonito flakes are a lovely effect as the sizzling takoyaki make them sway. Take a second to soak in the presentation. No but really take a second. Don't be like impatient me who bites into molten takoyaki, disregarding all warnings and good sense! I knew better, but I do these things constantly with pizza slices, and with delicious Japanese street food snacks, evidently.\n\nI am a fan of Maru's savory ping pong-ball-sized pancakes, filled with pickled red ginger, scallions and octopus. Takoyaki, handmade while you wait, eight of them are served up nice and hot... A golden steamin plate of takoyaki, covered in shavings of dried bonito, nori, a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce. It's a really great snack, and you know I love a little nosh to share \"on the way\" here or there. I need incentives and rewards for everything. The spicy octopus variety with a little shichimi mayo fits the bill quite nicely.\n\nAlso, after peering at the Maru ball cooking process, I am sure that I now really want a nice cast iron takoyaki pan for my very own, to add to my stockpile of kitchen paraphernalia. In addition, just want to note that I love Maru Global's red lanterns with the cute octopus fella on em... My house needs some of those too, because I can't stop hanging decorations from my ceiling. I can not stop.\n\nA really nice couple run this very tiny shop of wonderful authentic Japanese bites. I'll be back and back and back.",

  "text": "The IMA's collection rests on its chief benefactors, namely the Clowes, Lilly, Marmon and Pantzer families and their differing collecting tastes. While Indianapolis is a relatively old Midwestern city, the IMA's history is recent; it was known as the \"Art Association\" until 1969.\n\nThe recent multi-year renovation, redevelopment and expansion of the Museum and grounds created an entirely new experience for art patrons.  Let's all say our condolences to the Krannert Pavilion's Brutalist architecture of the 1970s and hello to a somewhat uninspired series of camera-ready atria that will no doubt allow some very impressive parties.\n\nThe collection itself is conservative and unprovoking.  Highlights include Robert Indiana's iconic masterwork (and trademark-infringed) \"LOVE\" painting and sculpture, a beautifully painted though incredibly ill-placed Rembrandt, a decent Hopper, an encyclopedic Asian art collection that is one of the best in the country, and the largest collection of JMW Turner drawings outside of Great Britain (although quantity does not trump quality).\n\nI thought the gift shop was as poorly stocked as the previous one.  Not a single postcard of the new museum's exterior, yet there were plenty of old postcards showing the now-demolished Krannert Pavilion.  And for an artwork that's been copied, dubiously appropriated and downright stolen, why was there not one postcard available of Robert Indiana's outdoor \"LOVE\" sculpture?  And what about museum merchandise based off its own artwork: scarves with motif from the museum's Tiffany piece, jewelry pieces mimicking something from the Asian galleries or pop-up note cards laser-cut with the new museum facade?  Sure, all the \"LOVE\" stuff is nice, but capitalize on other museum strengths.\n\nThis is a wonderful museum that has a decent collection.  The parking is free, the new eating options are terrific, and there are other fun attractions on the museum grounds, most notably the Lilly estate, Oldfields.",

  "text": "My husband and I are sushi junkies. We absolutely love it and could eat it multiple times a week without batting an eye. Where we live, we get some pretty good sushi, but it's nothing like the sushi we had when we ate at IRB Sushi. Holy smokes it was delicious! Often here in Cincinnati, we often treat ourselves to sushi when the few places around here offer half-priced sushi deals on certain nights of the week. For the price and quantity we had here, it blows every single place we go to locally, right out of the water. The fish was delicious and fresh, the rolls were beautifully crafted, it was truly an enjoyable meal and we both enjoyed every single bite we had. For the two of us to have 5 rolls, and two house salads, the damage was a mere $53. We looked at the bill and our jaws just dropped. That's such an inexpensive tab for the meal that we had. The server we had was great, she was attentive, and kept our drinks filled, despite being completely busy. My only concern was the amount of open space in the actual restaurant felt a little... empty. Like they could have fit at least 3 or 4 more 4-top tables in. That would have eliminated the need to wait for 30 minutes like we had to when we first arrived. \n\nThis was our first trip to IRB, but I know when we come back, we're going to be going to IRB Sushi again!",

  "text": "A very upscale and respected chain, with a short list of cities to allure with their prime cuts of meat and their fresh seafood. Philly is lucky to be one of those three cities! \n\nThe bar melds perfectly inside the restaurant and does not make you feel like it is the \"bar\" area. Tables fill this room for dining or having a cocktail. One step up and to the side is an elevated floor, where we sat.  Beyond the \"bar\" area that you walk into, is a more secluded dining area, but we were center stage and had a great view of it all. \n\nHubby and I ordered and shared three appetizers. We loved them all, but I was partial to the escargot and the oysters Rockefeller and he to the clams casino, so I did not mind letting him finish the clams while I devoured the other two appetzers. We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. \n\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect. \n\nWhat I loved most about the service, for such an upscale establishment, the wait staff was not at all uptight. The waiters were professional, but with charisma and humor and knew how and when to have conversation. \n\nBottom line, I would go back in a heartbeat!\n\nWheelchair accessible with ramp through main entrance into the lobby of the hotel and entrance right in through their door.",

  "text": "We made the journey through the cold and snow, all the way out to St Charles, with our friends the D's to try Hendricks BBQ.  We found a warm bustling place with a nice Saturday night feel and some decent barbecue.  Hendricks offers most meat choices that you would expect; both St Louis style and back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and sausage (what no goat? Oh well.)  Hendricks has a seriously large menu, obviously centered around barbecue, but the weirdo in your party could find something else to eat.\n\nWe had a great waiter, Aaron.  He was well informed ( I was impressed that he actually knew the definition of St Louis style spare ribs) and when we each ordered a Pick 2 platter, he informed us that each couple could split The Whole Shebang for the same price and actually get to sample all six meats for the same price, so that is what we did.  Apparently it is a default to serve the meat without sauce, which \"meats\" with my approval.  There are four sauces on the table.  Each of these trays of meat comes with four sides; so Ms T and I had two slaws, greens and sweet potato fries.  The D's added cheddar grits, sweet potato casserole, green beans and baked beans.  So here we go from first to worst.\n\nHendricks makes good ribs.  Both the St Louis style and the back ribs were smoky, moist, tender and nicely seasoned with rub.  The rub is the same on all meats and has a slight sweetness.  If it were over-applied, it would be too sweet, but it was in the proper proportion.  I would order these ribs any time and to me there is really no significant reason to choose one over the other.\n\nNext for me was the pulled pork.  I am not a fan of pulled pork in Missouri.  Often it is in large hunks and dry.  This was pulled to bite size and was moist, but not wet.  I would recommend this for a sandwich and it would be my second choice after the ribs.\n\nThe brisket was surprisingly good for this neck of the woods.  It had a good balance of smoke bark and beefy flavor.  It was nice and tender, but was on the edge of dry.  This would also make a good sandwich, but might require some mayo to lube it up.  I know this can vary a lot from brisket to brisket.  This is also worth ordering but at least this one night, was not quite as good as PM in Chesterfield  Valley.  Still pretty good for Missouri.\n\nTurkey breast and sausage bring up the rear and I would not re-order them.  Turkey is always a real gamble.  If it is not overdone and you get to eat it as it is sliced, before any juices run out, it can be magnificent, as we experienced at Black's Barbecue in Texas.  This had pretty mild smoke and was fairly dry.  It was not sawdust though and you could make a sandwich with plenty of mayo that would be credible.  I just would not order it again, though on another night it might be fine.  \n\nThe sausage was, hmmmm.  I almost liked it.  It was not like Hillshire Farms (a point in its favor).  It had some nice heat, Ms T and the D's found it too spicy but it is not really.  I like the locally made jalapeno and plain sausages in Texas.  They can be sensational.  My issue with this was that it tasted like Pine Sol.  This is either carelessness at the butcher shop with disinfectant or it has a spice in it resulting in that flavor.  Is it juniper berries?  A-1 Steak Sauce kind of has the Pine Sol thing going, maybe they are basting it with that or it is in the mix.  Whatever, all I can think of is \"the Power of Pine Sol, Baby\" when eating it.  I'll pass on that next time.\n\nSides - Ms D declared the green beans to be just a little better than plain out of the can.  (try some at Alcenia's in Memphis) They loved the sweet potato casserole, likening it to dessert.  They liked the cheesy grits and the baked beans.  I did not sample them.  Aaron warned me off the baked beans due to onion.  \n\nThe only think Aaron was not accurate on was the slaw.  He thought it had no onion, but that was all I could taste.  This is very finely ground (not shredded) slaw in the style that you get on dogs and burgers in Carolina.  It is unique, but inedible.  This was one of those rare times when we left the slaw.  It is unspeakably bad.  The sweet potato fries were fine.  The collard greens with bacon were good.  They were cooked well enough and seasoned with meat.  I enjoyed them.  There are even more sides to try.\n\nHendricks was worth the drive on a winter night.  I think we need to meet our St Charles friends, the L's there.  So go, have some ribs, maybe a pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  You will want to bring your own slaw.  I'm going to be generous and go four stars on the strength of the ribs.",

And I got those oysters. \nI also got a warm welcome, great beer and hello - happy hour!  Thank you John Besh for doing what you do.  #superstar #kingofnola",

  "text": "It's more of a solid 3.5 stars.  This was our first time at the jersey location.  It was very spacious, clean, and empty.  Well, it was a Tuesday night and there were only about 4 other patrons there; we had the whole back room to ourselves.  We ordered quite a bit for two.  We started with scallion pancakes, meh i've had better.  It was nothing special.  The guy had the spicy beef noodle soup, beef was braised as well.  The broth was delicious and spiciness level was a 5.  When he asked the waiter if the size was comparable to pho the waiter did not have a clue to what pho was.  You work in an asian resto my dude!  Granted this is not a viet joint, but you should be well rounded about asian cuisine overall.  Anyway, the dan dan noodle is a staple when dining at Han's, the spiciness level was a 6 and they accommodated me by not adding meat to it.  I also ordered the spicy cucumber, spiciness level was a 6.  After one helping i was over it.  The garlic overpowered the rest of the flavosr as i kept munching on it.  My eyes locked in on the salt and pepper shrimp entree so i had to order it.  I love this dish.  The minced pepper and onion just heightens the flavor of the shrimp.  Shame that it was on the pricey side, $19.95.  I think there were only about 10 pieces of shrimps.  The guy had a chicken entree that he liked, nothing special.  We ended up having leftovers cause we wanted to try different things.  I think next time i'll just stick to the lunch menu or take out.",

I ordered and split the dan dan noodle and the pepper fish. The dan dan noodles were great! The spice goes great with the peanut taste. Plus I love the type of noodle they use. Nice, chewy, and carby-YUM! They mix the noodle right at the table, so it comes out so quickly.\n\nThe fish was also great. So crispy, yet not overly fried/oily. It came on a bed of red and green chile peppers, and green bell peppers. Be careful not to eat the chile peppers, they are hot!! \n\nWould come again and highly recommend this place!

It's like the stuff you might get on an airplane. However, who in their right mind comes to black thorn for Chardonnay anyway??? It's all about the beer here.\n\nI know this place seems sketch...they do not even have a menu online. Oh noes, what will I do? Well if you have a hankering for Chicago style deep  dish pizza and you want to know what they offer you seriously need to call them or look at the yelp pics of the menu. If they give you sas, well I'd say that's expected of a grungy place, but that's not necessarily true. I really didn't get a good feel for their attitude here. \n\nWhen I was there it took forever to get a drink because of how \"busy\" it was, but like I said it was mostly expected. It's tiny and a bit rundown feeling like a dive bar. Not my favorite feeling but that's part of why they don't get 5 stars from me.\n\nIf it's busy you probably won't find seating immediately. The best solution is to scope things out and play some arcade games until something opens up! \n\nThe pizza here is seriously an awesome combo while you are drinking. I love deep dish, and while black thorn isn't my all time favorite, it's pretty good for st Louis. \n\nKeep in mind deep dish takes forever to cook and when you are in line for your pizza to be made it could take an hour, which means you might already be feeling the buzz of your alcohol kick in.",

The ladies doing our toes were very nice and they attempted to engage my daughter. They were very sweet to my other 8 year old daughter who doesn't care to be touched and so didn't get her nails done. I got the basic pedicure, which I liked, but I think next time I'll go one up. My daughter had little flowers painted on her toes which she LOVED. The ladies were very patient and nice, and that goes a long way. The only thing that would really make this place awesome was if they acquired a couple of cute kid pedicure chairs. My girls and I love going to another salon where they have 2 pink kid-sized chairs, which they can sit in more comfortably in as they're made for their size. If that happened, we'd be here all the time!",

  "text": "I love visiting new places and I love trying local brews and wines when I am in those places.\n\nWe were out and about in Saint Louis and decided it was time for some beer (it is always time for some beer) and turned to Yelp to find somewhere not Anheuser or Budweiser to go to, that was also close by.\nEnter 4 Hands Brewing.\n\nAs we drove up the dead end street, we saw what we thought were food trucks and I got a little excited. But upon closer examination, they were pop-up clothing store truck things. Also very cool! But not of interest to me on that day.\nThere is street parking, but there is also a decent sized lot across the street from the brewery. \nIt is kind industrial, which I like. It fits well for a brewery. Like Brad G said, if gave me Rhinegeist vibes. Two floors for your local brew drinking needs. Exposed brick and wood is the kind of vibe going on. On the second floor are plenty of community style tables, arcade games, projection television, and another bar. If you are floor-hopping, the POS system is connected between the bars, so you can order on your tab at either one.\n\nAs for the beer, they have a nice variety to choose from. I don't like IPAs, and they definitely have more than just hoppy beers! Fruity beers and sours/goses/saisons/shandies are my kind of thing and they had several on hand to sample.\n\nI do wish you could get a flight of 4 for the price of a regular beer, but the prices are per sample. 3 small samples end up costing more than a full pour of something, but if I want to try a few different beers without getting wasted it'll cost me more.\nAlso some bartenders were letting some patrons have free samples (about half a tasting glass worth) before they ordered a full glass of something, and others didn't offer it, or it was just offered to some customers. I would have liked that option and then gotten a full pour of my preferred choice.\n\nStill, if you like beer and you like drinking local, 4 Hands is a cool place to do it!",

  "text": "Featuring only Canadian ingredients (over 90% of which are sourced in Alberta and BC), the now 11 week old addition to Edmonton's growing 124 St was not far down on my list to eat. Our reservation was for 7pm last Saturday and when we arrived, it was surprisingly not fully seated! A long bar counter actually allows diners to show up without reservations, something I wish I would have known earlier. Large windows made it feel quite open and as the night went on, the dark interior gave it a very trendy atmosphere.\n\nTo start, I had my mind set on a Caesar, a truly Canadian drink. I didn't even bother to look at the drinks menu (whoops!) and when I ordered, our server Chris kindly told me they had removed it from the menu. Aperol Spritz then? North 53′s mixologist Brendan Brewster (formerly Woodwork, Manor Bistro), happily accommodated my off menu request. \n\nJoe and I decided to order off the a la carte versus the $85 tasting meu (lowered from the original opening $100), although many tables were doing so. There's just something about being able to choose what to eat!\n\nThe \"Various Beets\" has been on the menu for some time now and that's always a sign that it's a winner. Indeed it was. Beets sourced from Riverbend Gardens, done in a multitude of ways: sorbet, pickled, and dehydrated meringue; layered with a goat's cheese mousse, red wine vinaigrette, candied walnuts, and nasturtium (a watercress-like leaf with a peppery taste). Best presentation ever. And incredibly delicious! The beet meringue was the most intriguing, dehydrated to the point that upon contact with moisture (your mouth), it almost dissolved into a burst of beet flavor. What just happened there?!\n\nWhile I was pondering away on the use of a dehydrator, Joe was trying the duck rillette, which he chose from the menu. Similar to a pate, the Fourwhistle Farm's duck was cooked until tender, shredded and formed, topped with pieces of smoked duck breast, and cherry gelee. Gastriqued cherries along with a cherry and hazelnut puree decorated the rest of the plate. Joe loved the gastriqued cherries and both of us enjoyed the smoked duck breast. More of that, please!\n\nSauteed carrots came on top of pearl barley risotto, finished with the Cheesiry's pecorino stock, freshly shaved perocrino, and watercress. Sprinkled over top was a dehydrated brown butter powder, giving the dish another layer of seasoning.\n\nThe black cod, sourced from Vancouver Island, was done to perfection and supremely moist. Little neck clams and a clam froth were mixed in with the butternut squash puree and roasted butternut squash, although a different server (not Chris) said they were oysters when he brought it out. I really enjoyed this dish and it's because of dishes like these that I'm always keen on ordering a fish entree instead of another protein. I won't know how it compares to the wild boar or milk fed veal sirloin tip until my next visit!\n\nI have learnt that two desserts will always make me happier than one and seeing that we were both 80% full, why not. Chris highly recommended the sunchoke ice cream. This dish is definitely not to be missed! Aside from the creative use of sunchoke, it was placed on a thyme sponge, layered with balsamic vinegar curd and more of the brown butter powder, this time with black malt. The ice cream was very well done, smooth, no crystals of ice and had such a pleasant flavor. The thyme sponge had a... spongey texture. Honestly one of the most interesting things to eat, next to the beet meringue we had earlier. Really starting to wonder what kind of dehydrator they're using back there!\n\nOur second dessert was the wild blueberry sorbet, accompanying a goat's milk panna cotta. On the bottom were dried blueberries, roasted rolled oats, and a blueberry tuile to anchor the dish. All components were gorgeous, and overall the dish was very unsweetened, which can be a nice way to end a meal. The tarragon granite might not be for all, especially if you do not enjoy licorice! I didn't even know tarragon had that natural taste, it's always mixed in with other herbs when I've had it.\n\nOverall, the meal was one of the best that I've ever had. Points all around for presentation, creativity, and taste! It's like an episode on the Food Network. Not only that, the service was excellent and the kitchen was timely with our plates. Chris was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and its ingredients. I had read from some diners that the atmosphere was quite formal, but not so when we went. Quite relaxed in my opinion but they may have eased up, much like the cost of the plates.",

  "text": "Wow. I was really impressed with the taste of the burgers and fries at Five Guys. They stand head and shoulders above other fast food joints in Edmonton (and area). \n\nI went to In 'N' Out when I was in Vegas, loved it, and was talking to a friend about wishing we had them here. She said the closest thing was Five Guys, and she was right!\n\nI went on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm, and it was busier than I expected it to be. There seemed to be a little bit of organized chaos going on behind the counter, but they must have their system down. Our food came pretty quickly.\n\nNow, all the burgers come with two patties as the standard, so if you only want one, order the 'little (burger name)'. I had a little bacon burger, my husband had a regular sized bacon burger, we and shared large cajun fries - everything came to $18. Holy moly, yum. Just delicious. Kind of indescribable, actually, which is a little funny for a fast food burger. It was just so fresh and juicy and actually tasted like something, rather than a slab of cardboard with ketchup on it. The cajun fries were nice, too, although I still want to try the regular fries sometime. Even though I got a little burger, I still couldn't finish it!\n\nI wish there was a Five Guys in Edmonton, but for now I'll have to settle for hitting this one up when I'm in ShPk. Sure it's more expensive than \"regular\" fast food, but it's also way tastier.",

I loved the food I ordered.. except everything lacked a little seasoning. Also, the bacon was completely dry. I love bacon in any shape or form, so I didn't seem to mind the lack of grease. The jalapeno grits were spectacular and so was the biscuit. My friends seemed to really enjoy their breakfast as well. The fries again, lacked seasoning which seemed odd. How does one forget to add salt to fries? We were too hungover to notice or care.. Overall, its a pretty good place if you're looking for decent French food.",

It's tiny with small tables and you'll have to twist your way around the chairs to get to the back corner, but the food is great.\n\nI really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.\n\nAnd for those of you who can't handle spicy too well like me, don't forget to request it mild because they won't ask you how you like it and it'll come served with a kick like it's supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).  We ordered the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and pad thai.\n\nLove the food, but the venue is pretty cramped.",

The owners of the place are super friendly and very knowledgeable do they were able to give us a brief history of escape rooms. You can tell that they want everyone to enjoy the experience as much as they did when they did their first escape room which is great! I would highly recommend this place! It is relatively new but I think it'll really take off over the next couple months!",

Our waitress was awesome, very welcoming and knowledgeable. I started off with the red pepper and gouda soup- just as wonderful as it sounds. Plenty of substance, not overly cheesy - very filling for a soup. Everyone else got one of the signature martini's. Everyone loved them, except two people with the same martini complained their drinks were dissimilar, and the waitress and bartender quickly corrected it, no problem. They have small plates there, which aren't my thing, but the one person in my party who got one liked it.  There was a fish special that looked and apparently tasted delicious. At the end, we each got desserts. \n\nThis is definitely a dessert bar- the portions were huge. I seriously thought they brought me two. I ordered a blondie, and received a large brownie AND a nice portion of ice cream- I was in heaven; just as delicious as it looked. \n\nGreat service, great food, great dessert. All I need. \n\nOn another note, I love that they had several areas, a bar, an area with tables by the window, and two sections with more personal seating, sofas and comfy chairs in the back. Really something for everyone, except for people expecting big burgers...",

I looked for places near the interstate that were highly rated and East Coast Pizza was a match.  There a good amount of indoor and outdoor eating.  I'm so glad that we stopped here because this is exactly how I like New York style pizza.  There are a large number of pies on display that you can get individual slices from.  I always prefer getting a fresh pie out of the over so that's what we did.  The sauce and crust were especially perfect.  I was full after two slices but had half of another one because I didn't want to stop eating.  Someone who I assume was the manager or owner stopped by our table to ensure that we were happy with everything, which I thought was nice.  They have a loyalty program if you are a regular customer.  I live too far away to come here often but I will definitely be back.  Thanks Yelp for another great find!",

The difference in the customer service alone is worth it     GREAT floral section, amazing fresh fruit section, and the baked and organic breads are so good,    With the app on your phone, when you go into the store in registers what you usually buy, and you get great deals on that.

And even if you aren't an alcoholic, they have so many lovely choices that you could soon be on pace to be one after talking to the super helpful staff.\nI had been here a few years ago and it was nowhere near the empire it is today. They have great selections of wines and liquor in a store with a relatively small footprint. I had fallen into a bad rut with my red wine habit which I was standing in front of sighing, knowing that the spark in our relationship had fizzled, but not quite being ready to break up with my go to wine. A clerk took mercy on me and suggested that if I like something that was full body but not ultra high tannins, I should try Charles Martini Cab and a Francis Ford Coppola blend. Both were amazing and sooo much better than what I had been drinking at about the same price point.\nI had come in with an out of state friend who was looking to get awesome whiskeys and found a better selection than Frugal McDougal's. I also picked up some new bitters for my growing bar and, don't you judge me people, some giant sippy bags of margaritas. I don't know why. They were on sale and it was pregame time of year. As I stood in the check out line looking at the oversized sippy boxes that were the equivalent of a giant glass of margarita, the checkout guy seemed to sense my doubt. He said, \"you know what these are good for?\" and I shook my head to indicate 'not really'. He then held one up to his mouth in a mock chug and said - Red lights with no cops around.\nIt was all the wrong. So, you know. They are clearly my people.",

  "text": "Harbor Seafood is the type of restaurant that's most like a bag of Lay's chips. One visit is never enough.  I can't begin to count the number of patrons I hear say they have just landed at the airport and headed straight over, or they have been in town a few days and already visited multiple times, or are headed home and just had to stop in one more time before the flight home.  The one thing I love most about this restaurant even more than the food is the fact that I can sit at the bar on any given day and I'm just as likely to sit next to a regular as I am to sit next to someone from half way around the world. People literally flock to this hole in the wall neighborhood seafood restaurant.  It's a relatively small restaurant so if you need a table your more than likely going to have to wait. Sometimes when it's real busy there is even a wait for the bar. All seating is first come first served & they do not take reservations. You can also order food to go if you don't have the inclination or the time to sit in the restaurant and eat, but I'll admit this is the type of food that is at its best when you sit in and eat. \nSpeaking of the food.... All of the fresh fish served in the restaurant is taken from the fresh market which is next door to the restaurant. It's all in the same building just two separate entrances.  There is always a fresh fish of the day on special along with various other specials to tempt your taste buds.   Harbor serves boiled shrimp all year and boiled crawfish and boiled crab when in season, fried or grilled baskets, various seafood po-boys, and seafood salads.  Some of my favorite items to order are: Appetizers... fried calamari, fried pickles, 1/2 blackened gator 1/2 fried gator, cheese sticks, fried crab claws, and fried crawfish tails. Some of my favorite main dishes to order are... Boiled shrimp, fresh fish of the day, stuffed lobster, any of the baskets including stuffed shrimp, catfish, oyster, the combo basket which includes shrimp, catfish, oyster and stuffed crab, also the swamp platter which is a special combo that includes fried crawfish, frog legs, gator, cajun gator sausage, turtle soup, and  crawfish etouffee, and don't laugh at me but I also like to order the kids burger.\nHarbor also serves raw oysters on the half shell! You can order by the half dozen or dozen, or multiple dozens. There is always an oyster shucker on hand, and they always shuck in full view of the restaurant.  I have to say this: if you order raw oysters, don't forget to tip the shuckers because they are working just has hard as your waiter or waitress.\nHarbor seafood is my go to restaurant for seafood,  a burger, a drink at the bar after work or any other time of day. I enjoy the variety of people who work here and also enjoy the variety of patrons I come across on any given day, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I enjoy seeing my artwork on the wall in the restaurant.  I've made friends here over the years so all I can say now is, Cheers! Hope to see you at Harbor one day!",

There was live music performed on a Saturday night that was pleasant and upbeat.  \n\nWe shared the cold appetizer sampler (traditional hummus, eggplant and giant fava beans and dolmades - delicious and the dolmades are perfect) among 4 people, which was a good starter. \n\nI loved the special whole bronzino wrapped in grape leaves, but not as much as the whole dorado that I had at Kanella.\n\nI did NOT love the grilled calamari, as it was probably too fresh from the sea for my taste.  I am not accustomed to this style.  I like mine cooked through and sliced in rings, rather than large, soft, tenderized whole pieces (there were 4).  This may be a traditional Greek style of grilled squid, but I wasn't open minded enough for its mushy texture.  \n\nPersonally, I thought the Horiatiki salad could have used more cucumbers and tomatoes and less green peppers and red onions, however it was refreshing and tasty all the same.  \n\nReservations for weekend dinners are probably a good idea: I was told that it was a \"slow night\" at Kuzina by Sofia because there was a famous Greek singer performing in AC that evening, yet there was but one table free at 7 PM!  \n\nThough I enjoyed my  food from my first visit for lunch far better, Kuzina by Sofia still gets 4 stars from me for dinner based on the kind service, their welcoming accommodation to disabled persons, cleanliness, and the fact that Sofia smiled at me.",

We need three or four of these days a year.  \n\nIt worked out pretty good for us.  I had the Blue Ribbon burger and it was awesome.  I loved every part of it, and it was cooked perfectly.  My wife had the Magic Mushroom burger.  She really enjoyed it and it was so big, I got to try a bit of it too.  I wasn't as impressed with this one.  It was fine, but needed some zip IMO.  Our daughter had a kids grilled cheese and fries,  ate every bite and loved it.   We also got a mixed basket of regular and sweet potato fries, which we were too stuffed to finish.  They were pretty good, if not especially memorable.  \n\nDani was our server.  She worked extra hard to make sure we all had a good time and we did. \n\nI think the prices here are fair for the obvious high quality.  We don't go out for burgers much, but if we do, we'll probably be back.  I also noticed they have happy hour 4-6 SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, which is pretty unusual in these parts, so we might go back just for that.",

I was looking for a lambrusco and since they were out of that she helped me find a different italian sweet red wine (the adessa)  that was deeeelish.\n\nThe prices of goods here are about 50 cents to a dollar more than other places (for the same item, if u could find it elsewhere) but i still love it.  \n\nOh and their desserts look so good!\n\nI love dark, organic looking supermarkets :)....especially ones that have designated parking for expecting mothers.  haha.

Well... if we weren't so lazy, I guess we could peruse the website to see what they were, but that actually seems like a lot of work. So, I'm just going to say that for me, the three muses represent good food, good music and good cocktails. \n\nSimple enough, right?\n\nBut really, how many places do you go to where you LOVE the food, but the cocktails are so-so? Or the have delicious cocktails, but the food is lacking in flavor or originality?\n\nWell, this place gets it right!\n\nThree owners, from three different backgrounds, work together to bring us one place where we can get it all.\n\nI want to say that I've had different drinks here, but that would probably be a lie. The only drink I have here is the Blueberry Bellini... It is spectacular. If you like champagne and blueberries, then this is the drink for you. If not, I feel sorry for you. No one should go through life without a wonderous love of champagne.\n\nEvery now and again the chef will be inspired to add something new to the food menu, but the staples remain the same. My favorites are the  Lamb Sliders, the Lobster Eggrolls, the Feta Fries and the delicious Pork Belly. I've never had a bad dish here, but that Pork Belly is simply divine!\n\nThe music is one reason that I frequent this place so often. The shows are free, but they ask a 1 drink minimum per set. . I never have a problem with a 1 drink minumum. (Blueberry Bellini, of course). \n\nThe music various from traditional jazz to blues to local singer/songwriter reviews. They do a really good job of booking talent and being that the venue is so intimate, you actually have a chance to talk to the musicians before, after and even inbetweent sets. (Don't forget to tip. And if you can, buy them a drink.)\n\nThe only problem I have with Three Muses is tt's a pretty small place. and  it can get pretty packed... especially for the 7pm music sets; leaving you without a table or a bar seat. So, I suggest getting there between 6 & 6:30 for a pretty much guaranteed seat.\n\nThe crowd varies. But it's always cool people, who enjoy good food, good music and good cocktails, so you will be in pleasant company.\n\nHave a great time!",

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  \n\nI ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  \n\nIf you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be \"politely declined\" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. \n\nThey do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.  \n\nI will say that the their menu has changed since they opened and a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews is no longer on the menu.",

  "text": "It pains me to rate anyone a single star, but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.  \n\nWe, a three-some, went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door, smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork, but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good, or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard :).  \n\nFrom there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared, ripped, with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.  \n\nWe were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list, the server said, \"We don't have a drink list, but I can get you a wine menu.\"  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed, use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue, their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.  \n\nThe food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok, fine, benefit of the doubt, it must have been excellent and super-popular, right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns, I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.  \n\nOne of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy, the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends, if your mother ever made you mac and cheese, this will be a disappointment.  \n\nMy glass of wine was empty for, I don't know, a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.  \n\nThe facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser, mirror, and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.  \n\nI wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur, and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service.",

Food was ok, service was top-notch, serving size was small.\n\n-Free bread with green olive tapenade was served before our other plates.\n-Coca de Sobrasada- supposed to be chorizo, goat cheese, and honey.  The flatbread was soft, covered in a red sauce, topped with about 8 dime-sized pieces of goat cheese, and honey was drizzled on top.  It was delicious, but lacking any indication that chorizo was involved. Sliced into 6 pieces.\n-Pollo Relleno- manchego and chorizo stuffed chicken with lemon paprika sauce.  I found that the chicken was dry, so make sure to soak up the red sauce on the plate.  The amount of cheese was very lacking. 7 pieces served.\n-Tocino con Pina- crispy pork belly with pineapple sauce.  Tasted a little too much like charcoal and not enough pineapple to hide the burnt taste.  8 pieces served on the plate.\n-Datiles rellenos- bacon-wrapped dates- these were the table favorite.\n-Patatas Bravas- spicy fried potatoes with tomato sauce.  Not spicy at all.  These were ok homefries, but nothing that you could not make at home.\n-Queso Frito- fried goat cheese with lavender honey- this was my personal favorite, but there were only 2 discs of goat cheese in the order, maybe about 2 inches in diameter?  Would have loved to have more in an order!\n-Alcachofas Fritas- fried artichokes- delicious!  About 8 in an order.\n-Ceviche de Vieiras- thinly sliced sea scallops with citrus and avocado sauce- delicious, but maybe the equivalent of one sea scallop was in the order.  Disappointed about the quantity in this dish most of all.\n-Pastel de Tres Leches- sponge cake with three milks and whipped cream- another table favorite.  A good way to end the meal.",

I have not been blown away by anything, and the flavors of the dishes I have sampled (Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Mumbia Dal, and Navratan Korma) were fairly muted.  They also tout that the food is prepared without butter or ghee.  Um - I am not sure this is a good thing.  I enjoy the richness of Indian food; if I want light, I'll get a salad or something Mediterranean. The mumbai dal (a lentil dish) was so saucy and skimpy on the lentils that it might as well have been a broth-based soup.\n\nIn spite of my gripes, I do expect I will go back to Mumbai Bistro.  They fill a void for low-key, inexpensive Indian takeout in the immediate neighborhood.  They have a few tables set up to eat it, but it looks like their primary business is simple take-out.  The food (while somewhat uninspired) was all cooked well, and seemed fresh and hot in the buffet.  The space is clean, and the staff have all been friendly.  The idea of \"lighter\" Indian fare is not a bad one, but I would love to see them amp up their flavor a bit.",

It was light, but there was enough to make lunch filling.\n\nClaudio Mozzarella Sandwich - 4/5 stars - really tasty.

From 10-12 on Saturdays (and maybe Thursdays and Fridays as well?) they have a late night happy hour.  The special was $5 house margaritas.

I like when you can actually taste the tequila in a 'rita.\n\nWhile we weren't here for a full meal, we did try a few of the snacks:\n\n-queso fundido: Delicious melted chihuahua cheese, served with piping hot fresh tortillas, mushrooms, pickled red onions, and peppers. I really loved those red onions.  I could bring home a jar of those.\n-the chicharrones: pork rinds served with a dangerously spicy salsa verde.

  "text": "I purchased a Groupon for a night stay here in a Jr. Suite & the room was 50% off & ran $200 with the discount.  I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  \n\nFirst off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  \n\nThe hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated \"Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings\".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told \"our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted\" I replied \"I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted\" I was then told \"well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available\" and I said \"no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed\" and was told \"OK, sorry you are disappointed\".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.\n\nOnce we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said \"oh, they aren't running tonight\" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  \n\nI'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.",

I love that I can go in there and spend less than 20 dollars and have a dish for a party that will serve well over 10 people. I also like that I can drive 2-3 extra blocks and find gas significantly cheaper. For example today the gas was approx 3.70-3.79 on 86th street. I drove a few miles down the road and got gas for 3.51 there. That is extremely well worth it when you are in a budget and drive an SUV. The gas alone is worth the membership. The only reason I gave them a 4 star rating and not a 5 is because for all the hard work they do they could pay their employees a bit more. Additionally their lines tend to get a bit long at times which can be nerve-wracking especially when there are employees who want/need extra hours. Other than that kudos from me.",

I had fun just walking around the entire property exploring different things, I took the opportunity to walk around after midnight for an hour or so and it was very peaceful walking through the garden areas and listening to the waterfalls. The room was nice, but nothing spectacular. Loved the small balcony. We ate a few times on property. The Old Hickory Steakhouse was high above expectations. Food was really good and the service was exceptional. One of the coffee spots (closest to the lobby) had breakfast sandwiches for $5.39 which turned out to be a sub-par product. It was first made incorrectly , and then when it was re-made, it was ice cold. If $5.39 is going to be the price, it better deliver $5.39 worth of value--and it did not. My interactions with staff around the hotel was very good. Everyone was friendly and pleasant to talk to, and would go out of their way to acknowledge you and make conversation. Even one of the maintenance people asked how our stay was while riding in the elevator.",

I felt like it was like their menu, simple and to the point.\n\nHere is what my wife and I ordered.\nBiscuits and Breads with Molasses-Pecan butter, Pistachio-Mint butter, and Burnt Orange Marmalade - This was delicious. My favorite part of the meal I would say. All of the biscuits and breads were cooked to perfection. The butters were a really good touch. I didn't prefer the marmalade though. Would definitely get this every time I go.\n\nHalf Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy - The meat itself was very juicy and flavorful. I was not particularly fond of the skin though. I can't pinpoint it. It was cooked very well, but I just wasn't a huge fan of how it tasted. The mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious though.\n\nI would definitely give this place another try sometime. I would really like to try their Mama's Cheesecake with Whiskey Sauce. Oh and get more of the biscuits and bread. Maybe I'll just order two of those next time, man were those good.",

I'm pretty happy that there doesn't seem to be any pilling or wear in the seat or along the inseam. I haven't washed them yet but I have stuck them in my freezer a few times for a couple of days after I sat near a fire and they got a little smelly. I've since gone back to get my 2nd pair, which were a skinnier leg cut. I see it as jeans that wear well and last are an investment--my last pair of chain store jeans were pricey and are already peeled and rubbed out. I am taking one star off though, because all the women's shirts are cut SLIM. I am a full busted gal, and there was no room in these shirts for the bust part. Which is unfortunate, because I love the styling and the look of the clothes. Hopefully someday there will be more space in the shirts!! Service is excellent, and friendly. I'll be back soon to check out the warby parker glasses they now have...",

Make sure you try the jerky, papaya salad, and pork sausage!\n\nYou know what else rocks? Phan's Kitchen! My top favorites of the night were her 10 chili papaya salad and that fantastic pork sausage!\n\nThe sausage that Phan makes in-house has such a great crispy exterior to it, and a lovely flavorful interior. Like the best bratwurst you'll ever have, the skin gets a great char while the filling is lovely and juicy.\n\nThat papaya salad ! Woo! Prepare yourself for a trip to flavor town! (Am I becoming Guy Fieri?) The way Phan crafts her papaya salad is unlike anything I've had before, and can only be described as authentic. Tangy, garlicky, and even vegetarian upon request, it's the best I've had in the city! The hand-shredded papaya is carefully hand-pounded in a mortar and pestle until the herbs and sauce ingredients are fully incorporated and the papaya is perfectly tender. I love it!",

If you're in the mood to stop in to a cafe, sample a few different flavors, pick your fave combination (I love the ciocolatto scuro), spend $5 on a small, and leave, Capogiro is a really good choice. If you want to hang around for a nice date or to get some good coffeeshop work done, it's not. The music is loud and hipster-ey. The lattes are good and the teas are okay, but the coffee is bitter. The service is also pretty questionable; it takes anywhere from 3 minutes (on a good day) to 15 minutes (on a bad day) between ordering your drink and having the staff put it on the bar and yell out your order. I like the free wireless but hate the lack of outlets. All that said, my biggest issue with Capogiro? The floors make this loud, *awful* noise when you slide your chair back. It sends chills up my spine.  Really good gelato, though.",

And the fact that they have kati rolls on their dine-in menu  for Tiffin Etc. doesn't hurt either.\n\nI was a bit confused as to how the menus worked when I first walked in, but that was cleared up after I figured out that people do take-out and seating is upstairs, where we could order from Tiffin and Tiffin Etc.'s menus.\n\nWe ordered a papdi chaat to start, which was pretty good (chaat is one of those things that I love eating, but then I realize that it's not that hard to make). When I saw kati rolls on Tiffin Etc.'s menu, I was giddy. Kati rolls are basically constructed of roti that may or may not be fried with eggs and then wrapped around tasty filling of your choice (hopefully). I really don't know why I get giddy when I see kati rolls on any menu, but I have to try them when I see them. (I have this same knee jerk reflex towards papdi chaat, masala dosas, and sometimes samosas. Yea, I'm into unhealthy Indian food.) I got the shami kebab kati roll which was great! My friend ordered his dish and a Masala Pepsi; obviously he didn't enjoy it because he didn't like the mix of cumin and salt in his Pepsi. But it brought me wonderful memories of India :)\n\nI'm not sure if they still offer diners both menus, but I would definitely order at least one item from the Tiffin Etc. menu; besides the pizza options that I didn't try, I think Tiffin tries their best to offer street/vendor type food here in Philly.",

I had to watch my budget the last time I was down in NO, because I really only wanted to spend on the most important part of my trip - food!\n\nThank goodness my sister's graduation dinner was held at Olivier's.  I was determined to save my ever growing appetite for that meal - even skipping breakfast.  We started with a salad & some fresh cornbread, which were both great.  The three entrees she chose for her menu were: jambalaya w/fried catfish, poulet au fromage, & shrimp creole.  My other sister & I went the jambalaya/shrimp creole route - 'borrowing' from each other's plates as we've always (lovingly) done.  \n\nThe food was good - albeit, expectedly,  a little mild on the spices.  I frequently make shrimp creole at home, so I tend to prefer my own.  I loved the jambalaya & catfish - in fact, I'd like some right now.  I had some merlot; and, then, another glass of an obscure blush wine.  I thought I was set for the evening after that....\n\nI'm never prone to using profanity, but the bread pudding here = obscenities!!!  Maybe I need to add a star to their rating.  My mother gave me a lecture about using whiskey versus rum, and what's the 'traditional, authentic' Louisiana recipe.  Hmmm, thanks Mama, but I really can't pretend to care when it just tastes so good!  Even my 2 year old niece knew that that was the best item served that afternoon.  I took my other half home to eat later & it was soaked in sauce. Yum!!!!  \n\nThe service was great, and my entire family had a great time.  The staff was very cordial and pleasant.

In fact this is one of my youngest daughters favorite places to get a chicken sandwich; specifically The Spicy Chicken Sandwich. This sandwich has a kick to it that will excite your taste buds and potentially make your nose run.\nThe reason I am giving this eatery such a high rating is the service! They have the nicest young people staffing this place with great manners and they are so attentive to the customers. They are always VERY busy, but they manage to take your order and get your food to you quite quick. They even walk around and ask if you want your drink re-filled!! That is going above and beyond. My over-all impressions are that they keep the restaurant clean, friendly hard-working staff equals great customer service, and pretty good food (for fast food). I just have to mention this too.... They are closed on Sundays (the Lords Day) to give their employees this day to worship. If you don't like or perhaps totally love the owners politics/in your face family values that is a big consideration when contemplating eating here and spending your dollars here. #gaymarriage",

This includes walking dogs, cuddling with puppies and kittens, socializing cats, grooming cats and dogs, doing office work, working at adoption events, fostering animals, grant writing or fundraising, transportation of the Teddy mobile shelter, adoption aide volunteer, Working on the pet food bank, Wednesdays pet visitations to the elderly, etc.  They also have the Rover bus that fixes cats and dogs.  They come to various neighborhoods and sometimes partner with other local animal rescues like the Pet Community Center to offer low-cost spay/ neuter.\n\nThis shelter is very clean and the animals are so sweet. Come visit!  Adopt your new best friend today!\n\n* Side notes:\n1. If you visit the shelter often, one perk of being a trained volunteer is that you can go to the shelter when its closed to the public on Wednesdays and before hours!\n2. If you are considering adopting, but aren't quite sure that you are ready, you can foster first and if you fall in love with the cat or dog, you get first dibs on adopting him or her!",

I swear I've been following the website and blog for months now trying to figure out what it was all about. The answer? Take the immersion or the 101 class. Only then will you understand what you're getting yourself into. \n\nAfter finally taking the plunge and taking a 101 class, I was thrilled with what I experienced and ready to jump into my first class. Since then, I've taken a split class and skinny jeans and wow! Both were so different but both were incredible workouts. I swear muscles I never knew I had are getting some action finally from these classes. \n\nWhat I really love is the variety. The classes can be cardio focused, strength training focused, or some wacky combination of both. Classes have elements of cheer, ballet, pilates, yoga, and sometimes everything in one. It's keeps every class really interesting, exciting and challenging. I can already see a difference in the way my clothes fit and this is only after three classes. Lauren Boggi, you're a genius!\n\nMy only complaint will likely go away once I'm a veteran and that is it's very hard to tell from the descriptions of the classes what I'm getting myself into exactly. I think once I have a few classes under my belt, I'll be able to get a better feeling.\n\nOf course the classes are expensive but they're worth it. The nolibs location is small but so intimate and convenient for me since I live in the neighborhood. The good news is that if they don't have a class I want to take, I can head over to the Old City location as the credits can be used at any location. All in all, I'm thrilled to welcome Lithe into my life!",

In the end I went with the Pork Paperdelle and my date had the pork chop, and we did the flash fried brussle sprouts for an appetizer. All amazing. Plus an excellent drink menu, lovely atmosphere, and friendly helpful staff rounded out the evening. Plus I'm pretty sure the chef/butcher was coming around to the tables making sure everyone was happy. A nice touch! Can't wait to come back and try other menu items.",

  "text": "Thank god there is now a Costco on the southside. I love this place but ... The north side location is too far away to take full advantage. \n\nGood selection is nice... And a lot of things I've found a very sufficient savings on; eggs, some condiments, coconut water and more. \n\nI like finding little gadgets that somehow are both practical and something I've meant to buy... Just hadn't taken the time. \n\nI used my \"free pizza\" voucher recently and was happy with the pie. Even at 9.99, it seemed like a fair deal when one does not feel like doing any food prep after unloading a vehicle. A vehicle that has an extra $100 worth of shit I didn't plan on buying when I walked in the door. \n\nThe staff has been helpful... Samples are convenient, as are the trash cans so I do not carry shrapnel from 7 samples through every aisle as I must make sure I haven't missed anything new. \n\nSome things are way too large of a supply for me unless having a party or the decision I love rice to the tune of 20+Lbs. to each their own. \n\nI have a feeling when I check my 2% balance I'm both going both be happy at the \"free\" money, but there could be a little sticker shock of what that means I've spent here. \n\nThe only downside is sometimes you have to watch out for inconsiderate people. I spent half of today finding ways around people. When you are in an aisle and can't get out... Blame the inconsiderate people, not the business owner",

I love you Three Muses.\n\nThe first time I came to this bar was a little over a year ago, I came to celebrate passing my qualifying exams, and because I was in such a good mood, I ended up ordering half the menu, only half cause I would have seriously damaged my wallet - hey, I'm only a grad student!\n\nSince then, I have come to Three Muses on several occasions, mainly for the food and REALLY for the desserts, I've had every single dessert offered here. I have not been disappointed with any of the dishes that I have had here! My favourite? Banana Marscapone Struedel by far!  The Peach and Blueberry Cobbler coming in second... Okay for some real foodz other than desserts, Kurobuta Pork Belly, Steak & Cake, Ms Moon's Boolgogi Rice Bowl, Lobster Spring Rolls, and Lamb Sliders.  Yes I may have named half their menu, but that's just how good they are!  Oh and don't forget to check out their daily specials! \n\nI love the food, I love the fancy sounding drinks (the sips I've had, since I can only have so much alcohol), and I love the live music. Did I also mention that it's incredibly romantic?\n\nThree Muses is definitely my favourite spot on Frenchmen and I frequently just want to come here.",

  "text": "I wish there was a half star option, so I could say 4.5, but since there's not I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. \n\nI really liked this place! I will say as a disclaimer that I didn't eat here, but I did drink, dance, and see a show. \n\nMy friends and I came last weekend to see the Disney After Dark burlesque show, and all of us loved it. We laughed our asses off. Don't get me wrong, there were sexy moments too. And live singing, which I definitely wasn't expecting! The show featured characters like Beast, Ursula, and Maleficent. Maleficent and Ursula, both drag performers, were absolutely fantastic. I really liked the balance of men, women, and drag that were all here. Way to be inclusive, 708!\n\nWe also had drinks. Two (of the four) of us were a little bummed because we wanted to try a cocktail called the Cruella de Ville, but they were out of one of the ingredients. It was a definite bummer but, stuff happens. Our \"cocktail kitten\" (I believe her name was Serenity?) was super sweet and apologetic about it. Instead I had a Lost Boy and a Tarzan, both were well poured and good, though I preferred the Lost Boy. I loved that the servers were dressed in burlesque style outfits as well- the one dressed like Alice is stunning. Our server was super cool about taking the Yelp discount, and was just overall really attentive and nice. \n\nAfter the show, we grabbed a few drinks at the bar. The bartender was super nice and attentive. The cocktail kittens were friendly and energetic and danced and talked with us, which I appreciated because all four of us were women. I was happy to see that they weren't just focusing on the men (which I've seen at other bars). I took a selfie with one of them, and she let us know if we checked in on Facebook we'd get a free shot. Which, who says no to a free shot?\n\nWe wandered outside to drink, and it was just a really great night. I'm not from the area, and have never been on that block in STL before. Everyone was really friendly and chill, the weather was warm. There was just a nice (and safe) vibe all around. \n\nI will definitely be back. Hopefully, to try the food next time as well. Thanks for a great night, Seven Zero Eight!",

(You could dress up or simply dress well and be at home here.)\n\nI was delighted by this place in three ways:\n\n1. Impeccable service. There was never a nearly empty glass of tea, and the server was simply among the best in her profession. The wine pairings she chose were also spot on.\n2. Everyone at my table loved their meal. My steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The pear salad was delicious, having the right balance of cheese, dressing and pear. The seafood gumbo and redfish garnered rave reviews from others in my party.\n3. The setting of the restaurant is also very relaxed. There were a few families with children here as well as all-adult tables and everything seemed as calm as it could be. You are steps from all the action of the French Quarter, but feel worlds away in here.\n\nIf you want to have a delicious meal, this is it.

  "text": "About a year and a half ago, my then-boyfriend and I were in New Orleans and took the Strange True tour with Jeffrey. It was a small group (5 people), and we loved it. I had been to New Orleans several times and taken a few of those big-name tours, so I thought I was going to get a lot of redundant information, but we didn't. Not only was the content great, but Jeffrey was a great storyteller and if you had any questions, he had answers. I could tell immediately that he enjoyed his job and actually cared about being a good storyteller, unlinke some other tour guides that I've had who were just going through the motions.\n\nFast forward a year and a half, and then-boyfriend is now my husband, and we were back in New Orleans for our honeymoon! I decided to book us on their bike tour, the cemetary tour, and the ghost tour. All of them were fantastic. And this time, we met Jeffrey's wife, and she gave us the cemetary tour. She's just as good of a storyteller as Jeffrey, and we got to watch her yell at someone who was writing \"XXX\" on Marie Leavau's tomb. (You shouldn't do it, it's disrespectful. And a felony.)\n\nThe bike tour was lots of fun, and we got to see areas of the city close to the French Quarter but a bit beyond walking distance. The ghost tour was interesting, and the only tour of the three this time that had other people on it. Being the night before Halloween, there were more people on the tour than normal - but it was still only a group of 10 people! We were walking by groups of 30ish people, and I can't imagine trying to deal with that many people while trying to jockey for good position to hear the story. Blah! I have no idea how Jeffrey can afford to keep his groups so small, but I'm glad he makes it a priority - it really adds to the enjoyment of the couple hours you'll be spending with him.\n\nIf you're still on the fence....just take one of his damn tours already. You won't regret it.",

The drinks were kid of pricey but that is expected at a concert venue.  The bathrooms were pretty clean for the most part.  The sound was pretty good too.  I have been here twice and both times the upstairs was closed.  Bummer.  I would love to check it out.  There was a lot of little kids running around having fun which was pretty cool.  Made the place seem happier.  I will definitely be back.",

  "text": "After finishing my meal at Abyssinia, I sit here thinking to myself and wondering why I have never tried Ethiopian food before. I must say it was quite the experience. I live up on the North Side around 116th & Ditch road and it's a bit of a hike to get down there, but today I said what the heck and headed down to the little strip mall that houses Abyssinia and several other worth while \"joints\" as well! Having never done this I wanted to read up on it a little which actually helped me and I knew what to expect at least as far as tradition went. I chose the spicy lentil pouch to begin. Similar to a beef patty but triangular and stuffed with spicy lentils. This was awesome and piping hot! Then I got a recommendation from the server and ordered the sampler platter. This says, on the menu, that it comes with beef chicken and spinach in various ways of preparation. It sounded very good. Because I've never eaten goat and was a little apprehensive I wanted to stay away from it my first time out. When my order came out it had.... Well..... I really had no idea what it had!!! The dish came served on injera with rolls of Injera on the side. Injera is a very spongy almost rubbery flat bead that has little holes in it like an English Crumpet. The trick is to rip off a piece and scoop up whatever it is you've been eyeing on the dish! This was fun for me because I started to have wondrous flashbacks of all the times my mother would yell at me to get my hands out of the food and here I was digging, scooping and squeezing my way through an absolute heavenly plethora of spices, flavors and self made concoctions from my plate. I was a little afraid to ask what I was eating because it was so good I didn't want to know, YET! Of course I waited till the last piece of injera was gone and tried to eat the flattened out piece on my dish that had been there to form the wonderful spongy cradle soaking up all the flavors. The problem was I was stuffed and couldn't enjoy this last little tidbit. Just for the record, on my plate was some type of curried lamb. I love lamb but this was a little tough ( hence the 4 stars). I feel it could have been cooked to tenderize a little better. Chicken in a dark BBQ looking curry and cumin flavored sauce which was excellent. A sort of creamed but not creamed spinach, if that even makes any sense, at least that's how it tasted. Some curried potatos in the center of the dish several hot spices that I was warned by the server to go easy on (Really not that spicy ) But the best, to my surprise, was the Goat!!! It was extraordinary. So much that I could probably bathe in it. I'm mentally bathing in it right now while  I recount the tender, full of flavor spiced Goat.  Why have I not ever eaten this before. The server was extremely pleasant and attentive and the chef actually came out to my table and asked how I liked everything. I couldn't have like it any more. I will say this, I will come back. I can see me regularly ordering the spiced Goat and indulging with fingers grasping the injera to cradle the love on that plate.",

I ordered the hot chicken sandwich with truffle fries. The sandwich wasn't as hot as I'd hoped, but I also have a pretty high heat tolerance so most food isn't. The sandwich was juicy and flavorful, though, so I'd definitely order it again. I've found a new love for truffle fries recently so I approve of the ones here. A girl friend that I was with never had them before so when she tried it for the first time, she instantly became addicted. I look forward to trying more of their menu.",

  "text": "Quick service, friendly staff, and MAN-O-MAN do I LOVE the Chick-fil-a sauce. Chick-fil-a used to be my favorite fast food chicken sandwich, that was until I found PDQ! I still think Chick-fil-a is a good sandwich, don't get me wrong, but PDQ is probably twice as good, and it is definitely not twice the price.\n\nI still love the waffle fries and PDQ does not have Chick-fil-a sauce, but I am sure that I will be making less stops at Chick-fil-a now that I found PDQ.\n\nGrowing up in Michigan, we did not have Chick-fil-a. That being the case, I immediately became a fan upon moving to Florida. I have even gone so far as drawing cow spots on blank paper and taping them to by business suit to get my free chicken sandwich.\n\nI always go with the #1 and cover that baby in the Chick-fil-a sauce. I also give my fries a hefty dose of salt and pepper and then proceed to dip them in the Chick-fil-a sauce. I have it down to a science. I even started making my own fried chicken sandwiches at home and took steps to make them more Chick-fil-a-ish.\n\nNow that I found PDQ I have a huge internal conflict. I sure hope Chick-fil-a can drop the price of their #1 by a little bit, and then they may win my heart back, even though PDQ has a leg up on quality.",

  "text": "A regular stop on our errand circuit and a godsend during the winter months.   The positives are the generally good prices, the regular appearance of high end items (such as black garlic, purple asparagus, figs and heirloom tomatoes),  the sizable  array of chilis and peppers and the lovely, fresh flowers.   A concrete example of PJ's great pricing:  Three bunches of cilantro for $2 versus one bunch for $1.99 at Tanner's.   \n\nThe downsides are the divided fruit and vegetable counters forcing a shopper to stand in multiple lines, the uneven produce quality (some items appear to be seconds) and unreliable inventory (can't rely on any particular item being in stock) and the cash-only sale terms.  I also don't love the fact that you can't select your own fruit and veggies (pre-bagged) and the absence of scales so you can check the weight of items.",

  "text": "Two years later and Al & Co at Falconworks continue to impress and completely spoil us for any other mechanic.  We now take all our cars here to do any sort of work needed. The staff has been nothing but upfront, helpful and understanding, and we have zero complaints. \n\nAs for the reason behind the update, my boyfriend loves unique cars and has a hard time finding a good mechanic to deal with them.  We started bringing all of them to Al and he not only gives us great work, but seems to love doing it too.  We recently picked up a new 'project' in the form of an old FJ55.  From top to bottom Al has had great recommendations for the future of the car and has bent over backwards to help us manage the restoration.   He loves servicing old and/or unique automobiles and is great about doing research and contacting vendors that may have that hard-to-find part or advice you need.  His shop has even fabricated some of the parts we couldn't find.  Throughout this process we had times where we were the typical 'difficult customers', changing our minds about what we wanted done, not returning calls, having issues getting our paperwork in order, calling just to ask for advice, and not only has the staff here taken it in stride, but have been positive and patient with everything.\n\nAl truly loves his craft and is dedicated to making sure you not only get quality mechanic work, but takes time to explain (in person) what he is doing and why.  They also hate to take shortcuts and would rather do the best work possible once instead of fixing a symptom, but not the issue. I think out of everything, this is what I appreciate most about their service.",

  "text": "Ah Peppermill, home for the weekend. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I tend not to when there's a casino involved but I've learned to let my bf enjoy gambling while I enjoy sleep. One of the things I really liked was the landscape video slideshow, lots of Costa Rica footage which coincidentally is where my girl friends and I will be vacationing soon! Not to mention slides of Seattle which is where I'm pining to live. The large tvs are everywhere in the hotel/casino, it gives you something to look at while in line for the buffet, waiting for someone or when people watching isn't enough. We skiied for 2 days out of our 4 day trip and the Mt Rose shuttle picked us up directly in front of the hotel (in an airport shuttle, FYI: the REAL airport shuttle says Peppermill on it!) One of the first nights, we wandered around and found the bar across Biscotti's with music and singers, those singers can sing! I loved the rendition of Tainted Love. The trumpet player could use a little practice though, his playing was over powering and choppy when I think he meant to compliment the song with accents. The bar stocked Yamazaki whiskey which has been a fun find for my bf. The Island Buffet was ok, I wouldn't stand in line for it again, although there were a ton of various crab dishes and crab legs available. The spa was AMAZING. The smoke level at this casino seemed more tolerable than other casinos, Atlantis was gross in comparison. I hear they utilize air filters separately from built in systems to deal with the smoke. My favorite part of the trip was that we didn't have to rent a car, very rare for our travels.",

  "text": "So glad Mimi's is finally opened! It provides a great option for pizza, cheesesteaks and salads in Cherry Hill. The prices are very reasonable and they have a wide variety on the menu! \n\nWe called for pick-up and got a bunch of different things so we could try a little of everything and share in a big group. We did a cheesesteak, pizza steak, buffalo chicken cheesesteak, fries, and mozzarella sticks. The owner was so nice and since they were closing he gave us 6 slices of pizza free!! \n\nThe cheesesteak was great. Much better than a lot of other places in the area. You get a big hoagie stuffed with meat and cheese. The pizza steak was also delicious with a nice tomato sauce. \n\nThe buffalo chicken cheesesteak was really good! It is spicy and definitely has a nice amount of sauce on it. There were big hunks of bleu cheese which I'm not a huge fan of but I know some people like! \n\nThe mozzarella sticks come with like 8 to an order and were good. They tasted almost homemade! And we got a nice big order of fries for the side. \n\nThe pizza slices were gigantic. The crust is the perfect amount of crispness and we really liked the flavor. My sister loved he tomato pie while I preferred the white pizza with broccoli and tomatoes. \n\nWe will definitely order from Mimi's again and are happy to have them in the neighborhood! The owner is super friendly and we can't wait to try more. I believe they will have delivery or do already as well!",

  "text": "I must say by recent visit to Duckweed Urban Market was quite a shock and a surprise. I'm a Native and never imagined that a hip, trendy independent store would be lurking in downtown Tampa. I can imagine it in Seminole Heights,  but it blows my mind that it is in the downtown district.\nThis hidden gem offers such as assortment and variety of products for a small store. They had a few items I had been on the lookout for, but had been unable to find. PB2 is a ground powder of peanuts that you reconstitute with water and have a much more fat free peanut butter, they had 2 or 3 varieties. \nArtic Zero, a wholesome ice cream substitute is 150 calories per pint! Yes, you read that right & and as an ice cream lover, I have really been wanting to try this product.\nThis small grocery store carries a diverse selection of various wines and beers. Many products are locally grown, made, packaged...all Tampa area. They have a fresh produce area, homemade butter, homemade all kinds of products,  it was incredible. For a small store I spent over an hour perusing their offerings.\nThey have a deli full of many Boar's Head products, other tempting and tantalizing products & they also sell various fish & seafood & specialty delights. There is a juice bar & a bakery & a coffee bar, everything looks so tempting! There are pre made sandwiches,  wraps and specialty items as well as their regular menu & specials. I took home some mayo free homade tuna, it was absolutely delicious,  so light and flavorfull. Duckweed also has various frozen foods answer a wide assortment of juices. To meet all needs they also have staples like cereal, oatmeal, flour, toothpste... something for everyone.\nYes, this was quite a pleasant surprise and exciting for me as well as Tampa. Service was very pleasant and helpful. If I want to be picky, I would like to see some fresh pasta, more appetizer types of meat and lower prices. I understand it is a mecca of unique products, but I think some of the prices could be adjusted.\nIt is not real easy to access, but definitely worth the effort. I will definitely be a repeat customer. That tuna will always have a special place in my tum!\nWhat's a girl to do?  Always keep her eyes open to new ventures and food opportunities.",

  "text": "This Wawa is allegedly the highest grossing Wawa in the country. The reason for this is because it's right next to Penn's biggest freshman dorm, and it's open 24 hours. If you come here on a weekend night, there will be an abundance of drunk college kids, and you will have to wait a very long time to get any food. They usually don't have enough staff to keep up with the higher demand either.\n\nBut apart from that, Wawa is an amazing convenience store. They have a great selection of custom made food ranging from hoagies & sandwiches to frozen beverages to mac & cheese to quesadillas. Most of it isn't amazing, but it's really good when you're starving and need something cheap and filling. I also love Wawa's self service milkshakes. They of course also have the usual snacks and beverages of a regular convenience store.",

If you want a guaranteed reservation - go a little early, like before 8.

The crash of the balls, the pins, the happy folks - whether or not they are 300 bowlers (heck, I'm happy to break 100!), we always have a great time.\n\nFor 2 people 2 frames, shoes and a beer (I was too full from supper), was... $43 We had a ball.  \n\nI know they have live music from time to time, and hey - FRED PENNER was there last Friday.  I couldn't leave the house because of the air quality, but they have all the feels!\n\nThe only negative - and they can't help it, is the stairs.  Bowling alleys in basements were the norm when this one was built, so stairs.  There are larger stalls in the washrooms though.  Give them a call, before you go if you have mobility needs, and maybe there is an elevator somewhere that isn't up front.\n\nThis gem is our favourite in town... it's close, but if you plan to go in July - call first as it's their low season and they might be on vacation or undergoing needed maintenance!",

  "text": "Came here because a dear friend gave me a gift card.\n\nI'm sorry to say that Allegro il Gelato has completely spoiled my tastebuds. Completely. Obviously Frost has struck a chord here in Tucson, with all of its fans giving high reviews here and its many franchised stores. Me thinks that many, if most, have not tried Allegro's.\n\nOK, I start sampling flavors. I think I'm going to try as many in-common flavors as Allegro's for a fun comparison. Start with one of my perennial favorites--salted caramel. Yuck. Tastes artificial. OK, cinnamon next. Nope. The same. This is not good. Two of what should be home run flavors foul out. Maybe a fruit flavor will be better. Strawberry. Ugh. Tastes like grocery strawberries. (Coming from CA, that's NOT a compliment. How *does* Ivan at Allegro Gelato get his to taste so much like fresh CA freshberries?!!!) Only three flavors and already my mouth is \"frosted.\"\n\nMy wife tried Peanut Butter Crunch, Pumpkin, and Cinnamon. She said they all kind of tasted the same. She loves anything peanut butter. She passes.\n\nShe ends up with Cookies and Cream. It's OK. In desperation, I try chocolate. Acceptable.\n\nAfter experiencing Allegro Gelato, it was disconcerting to watch them just slap the gelato in the cup. Almost unappetizing. I'm thinking, \"You're not slinging mortar to lay bricks! Isn't your product better than that?\"\n\nI liked the flakes of chocolate in my flavor. It gave it a little nice texture to it. But let's compare other qualities. The texture of Frost in this chocolate was not bad. The texture in the other flavors were more \"airy\" than at Allegro. One thing that struck me was that with Allegro's gelato, there is a wonderful after taste that lingers on the taste buds like a romantic memory on my palate. 'Twas not so with Frost. The flavor was only present when it was in my mouth.\n\nLike Allegro, Frost has a round cookie (see photos) they put in the cup of gelato. It is a cheaper cookie than the hazelnut cream filled pirouettes you get at Allegro. I mean it's a good cookie, but I'm comparing here, and it is not of the quality at Allegro.\n\nThe spoons. Ah, here is where they outshine Allegro. They are multi-colored mini spade-like paddle things. And bigger than what Allegro uses. They are kind of cool.\n\nPrices are comparable with Allegro. Service is really good. My server always called me \"sir.\" Many employees on a Friday night made for fast service.\n\nSo bottom line is Frost is OK. At least the chocolate. The rest tastes like medicine to me. Will you Frost fans, who obviously have fallen in love with gelato, go give Ivan's gelato a try? He's not only Italian (like the owners of Frost, I understand) but he got his degree in Italy at the gelato university in Bologna.\n\nTwo or three stars?....Oh...I don't know....\"Meh, I've experienced better\"...Yeah, I guess so.",

After 2 hours - I was done haha.  So the coupon for the 2nd hour free worked without any problems. \n\nIf I came back, I'd definitely rent from them again!",

  "text": "It's the biggest and the best for a reason!\n\nMy parents brought us here on spring break when we were kids (Disney was out of our price range), and I brought my 4 1/2 year old cousin here over the weekend, along with my cousin (her mom), and my own mom. It was so much fun! I loved the costumes display...as most adults will. I was especially excited about the Star Wars items and the Ghostbusters costume. My mom got a kick out of the Whoopi Goldberg from Ghost and Laverne outfits. The 4 year old liked dressing up in the various play costumes in front of the mirror. \n\nShe liked climbing all over the stuff in the Dora exhibit and all 3 generations enjoyed the Barbie exhibit. The little one tried on lots of costumes and walked the runway, and we all drew outfit designs from various fabrics and magazine photos. New word for her: inspiration. Lots of boys were really enjoying the Barbie exhibit too.\n\nShe planted some seeds in the Biotechnology Learning Lab, rode the carousel, used several computer learning stations, helped sift sand to find fossils, and climbed around in the play areas. \n\nOur lunch was good too. There were fun kids meals like mac & cheese and potato smiles available, but we ended up going with pizza, breadsticks, a cheeseburger & fries, and a turkey sandwich. There is a nice selection of \"adult\" food like potato salad and multigrain sandwiches with gourmet aiolis alongside the hot dogs and finger foods. Milk, soymilk, juice, water, and dinosaur-shaped sugary drinks are available.\n\nAt the end of the day she told me she was going to come visit me \"all the time\" so that we could have \"lots of fun at the Museum\".",

She spoke with excitement about the food and was right on point with her recommendations. \n\nI ordered the veggie breakfast burrito which was pressed to make the wrap nice and toasty. The ranchero sauce is delicious and and feel free to be liberal with those dunks because its made from greek yogurt so its totally healthy. Win! \n\nPlease allow me to write a separate paragraph about the grits. As I wipe away a tear from my eye just thinking about the creamy consistency that one only gets from a grit after whisking for an hour an a half. The owner explained it's a true, \"labor of love\" and you can tell he loves his customers because he only serves food that is delicious and fresh. \n\nI can see myself becoming a regular at Refuel for the fun and friendly people, the bright interior with natural sunlight pouring in from every direction, the oversize mug with fresh brewed coffee, and lets not forget the food, ehem, grits.",

The bread pudding muffin was very good ...I don't necessarily believe that it was intended to be a breakfast item, but it worked!  They warmed it up and put a nice icing on it, delightful (4 stars).  As for the bagel sandwich, it wasn't mind-blowingly different than what you'd expect but was tasty nonetheless (3.5 stars).\n\nWe loved the cappuccinos and the friendly service.

  "text": "Famished all day, I was on a mission to find a new place to eat, but something fairly close to home. I felt adventurous, but NOT that adventurous to go too far.\n\nAfter living in the Tower Grove area for nearly 2 years, I finally decided to give Black Thorn a shot. All I've heard were good things minus the long wait people usually endure when coming here.\n\nJason and I got here around 7:30. To our surprise there was not a line nor was it insanely busy like we had anticipated. Another thing we had not anticipated was the set up of the place.\n\nYou have to place your order at the bar, get your own drinks from the bar, and pay all before you receive your pizza if you aren't going to keep an open tab. It basically has the same concept as a Bread Co. or Qdoba. Once you order, they'll bring you your pizza out.\n\nWe ordered a 12 inch Chicago style sausage and pepperoni pizza and a bowl of caesar salad to hold us over until the pizza came out. Little did we know that we were going to wait 30 minutes to receive the salad, then an additional 30 minutes after that for our pizza. As mentioned before, it was not busy. It had a few patrons, but not enough to cause the wait like we had to.\n\n8:30pm. Pizza is out. We're ready and holy hot damn, am I excited! The pizza lived up to the hype I had hoped for. The time spent waiting was well worth every bite I ate. I think the only downside is the wait time. I don't know how long it takes to cook the pizzas. I'd assume awhile considering how thick the crusts are, but still, could they not have told us?\n\nAs far as the attitude of the bartender, I have to agree with Aimee K. The girl looked like she had a blank stare on her face, and she didn't seem too pleasant to talk to. I asked her when our salad was going to come out, and her reply was, \"when we get to it.\" I went back to my seat and continued to wait without questioning. I didn't want anything to happen to our beloved deep dish pizza!\n\nAnyway, aside from that, I like Black Thorn. The rustic looking 1980s dive bar setting who outlived its hay day truly adds character to this place. It has darts, hurling, and a juke box. You can't go wrong, especially in this hipster neighborhood.\n\nCome check it out and you'll see what I mean.",

If you get there early in the morning you avoid the tram all together.  Also if you have elderly family visiting or young children/children with disabilities  you will greatly appreciate the paved route.  And you can always get off the paved road onto a variety of trails. \nI like Sabino more than Mt. Lemon- 1. its a shorter drive, 2. it really feels like Tucson!",

  "text": "If you're really into food and dining out, Vetri is a must. Besides earning you foodie cred, it's an opportunity for a memorable evening. A special occasion is a good excuse to go, and the staff will make a big deal out of it which will add to the charm of it all.\n\nWhen you're seated, take a sip of your complementary prosecco, take a deep breath, and relax. This is a 2-hour slow-paced tasting experience. The portions are tiny, but there are a lot of them.\n\nLook over the menu to be sure you're not going to get something you know you'll hate or miss out on something you know you'll love. But don't spend too much time on this process. Keep an open mind because you might be surprised to love something that didn't sound appealing. \n\nThe price is steep, yes. But you're paying for quality ingredients, impeccable service, and combinations of flavors more interesting than spaghetti and jarred sauce. It's important to remember that taste is subjective, and no one can guarantee that you absolutely love every single thing. If you expect to have visions of the Virgin Mary with every bite because you're dropping $$$$, and you'll be disappointed with anything less, you might as well stay home and order a pizza. \n\nAnd if the cost scares you, do what I did and save up your loose change for a couple of years.

  "text": "Love this hotel! I've travelled a lot (well, for a college student at least) and stayed in a lot of hotels, and this is the one I use as a benchmark to judge all other hotels by. I've stayed here many, many times.\n\nFree breakfast buffet and drinks (which now include an option of coffee too, yay for us non-drinkers) if you're a Priority Club member. Bonus! And the buffet is really nice, it's not just a continental breakfast. It's got the fruit, cereal, yoghurt, etc., but there's also eggs, home fries, bacon, sausage, even make-your-own Belgian waffles!\n\nThere's free parking, too, and also a free shuttle that takes you within a few miles - it takes you downtown, that's the important thing. Plus it runs until 11 pm so you have plenty of time to do whatever you want and still catch the shuttle back, rather than rely on a cab. The WiFi is free as well and works pretty well. Nice and fast, it's only been sluggish when I'm there when a convention or some huge business thing is there.\n\nThe rooms are awesome! I like staying on the executive floor, though the rooms aren't any different on that floor so if you don't want to shell out the extra cash, you can just book a standard room. It's nice and clean (I've never had any problems with dirty carpets or dirty anything else). You get a balcony no matter what, with either a view of the Parthenon on the even numbered rooms, or the stadium on the odd numbered rooms. The bathrooms are great, too. All I'd change is some extra shelving in the shower area as there just isn't enough room in there to put much of anything. But I love the shower itself! Nice water pressure and temperature, and the shower head is awesome. And I love having a shower and not a shower/bath.\n\nThe pool is nice, too. It's outdoors so it's only open in the summer, but it's clean and big enough to accommodate everyone. If you wait to go in the evening, by then everyone will be leaving to go to dinner and you'll basically have the pool to yourself, if you don't want to deal with kids.\n\nThe only downside is the parking. They stay so busy all the time that it can be really hard to find a parking space here. Be prepared to walk! Tip: the handicapped spots fill up (even the ones in the back) so if you have problems walking distances, make sure you get to the hotel in the early afternoon to get a better spot, and just rely on the shuttle or cabs. There's always cabs hanging around too so you'll never have to wait for one. Another plus is if you have a hybrid or electric vehicle, they have two charging stations in the back of the hotel! I only just noticed it this time and don't drive one so I'm not sure what the pricing is, but if you need to charge your battery while staying there, you don't have to drive around finding a charging station.\n\nIt's just an all-around great hotel with a nice mixture of affordability and amenities.",

Also, there is technically parking available, but it gets filled up super quickly, so be prepared to wait awkwardly if you come during busy dinner time.\n\nAs a large group, we pretty much ordered all of the appetizers, including greco salad, the broccolini caesar salad, the roasted bronzino, crispy artichokes, meatball, chicken parm, asparagus, octopus, short ribs, and a multitude of pizzas including margherita, eggplant, mushroom and zucchii and cipolla. while I can't speak much about the pizza, but heard great things about the cipolla, I really enjoyed the two salads, especially the broccolini and the spicy chicken parm. The asparagus and artichokes were a bit too over-oiled or fried for my taste. The short ribs were decent but just also a bit too fatty. The octopus was a tad bit on the chewy side and given how much it cost with how little were on the plate, I'd likely not get it in the future. I think if you want to eat frugally, the pizza and salad combination is likely the way to go, as the antipasti can add up, but overall, it's a decent, but expensive little Italian joint.\n\nFood: 3-4 stars\nService: 3-4 stars\nPrice: 2-3 stars\nAmbiance: 3 stars",

  "text": "I have only been here for one visit since I don't make it up to this area of town often, but this will certainly be high on my list of places to go when I am in the area. \n\nMy visit came on a Friday night, and it was packed. Parking was made very easy in the free parking garage just go north on 1st Ave from Main St. (the intersection of Pint Room), and you will see the garage on your left immediately. There was a hostess that said she could seat us in the dining area of the place, or we could have a look around the open-seating bar area. We got really lucky and grabbed a table as another group was leaving, but trying to get a table in the bar area on a Friday night looked like a game of chance, as it was busy the entire time. There wasn't really a lot of standing room, so if you don't get a seat you might just want to put your name on the list for a table in the dining area.\n\nI wasn't there to get food, which is good because it took me long enough just to decide on a drink from their enormous beer list. They have it broken down into categories of beers, and they cover the majority of the spectrum. The majority of their beers are on the safe side of things, but there are certainly some adventurous options on the list as well.  Don't quote me on this, but I am fairly certain that the beer list includes the name of the beer, the price, what state it is from, and the ABV %. It'd be nice to have an IBU rating, but even I will admit that I think that might be pretty ambitious for a list that long. I love that the price of every beer is listed by it. I'm amazed at how many places just have long beer lists without ever showing a price until you get your bill.\n\nOur waitress did a great job relative to how busy it was. The guy who came over to clean our table after the last group left was not so much in that category. We got beers filled quickly and our waters stayed full the whole night. Our server even knew a decent amount about the beers they served and she was able to remind someone at our table what they had they last time they were there by just the description alone. One thing that is really frustrating at a place like this is when you finally make a decision on the one beer you want the most, and then they server goes to get it only to come back and say they are out and need a second choice. I know with a place that likes to rotate taps and gets in limited quantities of some beers that it happens, but the waitress didn't even take the time to cross it off of the beer list on our menus so the next person who sees that option and orders it will also be faced with coming up with a second option with no time to think. \n\nIt was a little loud in here just due to the number of people, but it wasn't so bad that you couldn't have an easy conversation with the people at your table. The majority of the people here were young professionals, and the crowd was that of people who wanted to go out and get some drinks and dinner to catch up with friends, rather than to just go out drinking and getting wild for a night. There are quite a few TVs in the bar area, so all of the games you could want to watch will likely be viewable here, although it is much more of an upscale bar than a sports pub. As I said before, I wasn't here for food but everything I saw at surrounding tables looked delicious and I would like to give the food a try sometime, which I will likely be back to do in the summer when longer bike rides take me up to the Carmel area and I need a pit stop along the way.",

My BF and I came here late on a Tuesday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Not wanting to keep them open later than they intended, we asked if it was too late to be served.  Without hesitation, the host insisted that we stay and enjoy a private dinner.  It was lovely!  We started with the spring rolls which were the freshest spring rolls I have ever had, most certainly rolled to order, and absolutely delicious!  We then ordered a papaya salad and two of their special dishes - a beef curry dish and a shrimp dish.  WOW.  Each dish was better than the next.  The shrimp were some of the largest I have enjoyed in Reno and the curry was perfectly balanced and unexpectedly light.  Amazingly, we polished off 3 beers and 4 dishes because everything was just that good!  I love thai food and this is most certainly my new favorite!",

  "text": "Sky Cafe has now become a regular Sunday outing and it is better every single time I go. Normally I love having a \"secret\" restaurant, but the whole experience of eating there is so positive that I just want everybody to have the opportunity to eat there and have the lovely family that owns it do well.\n\nThe noodle soups are absolutely to die for. I ate the barbecued pork noodle soup today (N4) because I had been thinking about it since LAST Sunday when I went there. The egg noodles are great and made in house. The vegetables are fresh. I eat the wontons last because they soak up the broth and are even better at the end than they were at the beginning. The coconut rice is a delicious side and has the perfect amount of sweetness to it. I tasted everyone else's meals as well (including a pork platter which comes with an absolute TON of food, and a coconut based chicken soup) and one thing was better than the next. The tea is great. Water is always full. Not to mention all of the food I just listed, a huge lunch for 3, came to a grand total of $19.\n\nIf the great food, atmosphere, and prices weren't enough - the family that owns it is completely fantastic. A brother and sister do the serving and know every single customer's name after only asking once (and in my case - they never asked at all, I just came in one day and they said \"Hi Jessica\"). They are warm and friendly and really make the restaurant.\n\nPlease, everyone go to Sky Cafe for a dining experience that is what you wish all dining experiences were like.",

  "text": "I was torn about whether to give this place one or two stars. Our dining experience was terrible terrible terrible, but you can't beat the location or the open air set up. It really is quite lovely to sit, quietly watching   Jackson Square by that ever-present flickering lamp light. And the interior of the restaurant is lush and lovely and oozes history. It would have been much nicer, of course, to enjoy these things while consuming, say, drinks, or food. After a certain point, I might even have settled for the smallest acknowledgment from any employee.\n\nSadly, that was not in the cards for us. I'll spare you the details but the gist is that we sat, totally ignored by all the staff, for far longer than is acceptable. Once we were noticed, we waited far too long for drinks and food. The service was terrible terrible terrible. \n\nThe food (we both had red beans, rice, and sausage) was fine, though there was something slightly funky about the parsley garnish. Nothing outstanding, but I wasn't expecting outstanding. Given the size, location, and menu, I was betting on some adequate, tourist grade food, which is exactly what we got. \n\nSo, ultimately two stars for the location, ambiance, and the fact that the food is not terrible. But there is not a chance in hell that I would go back. You can find something better.",

I followed instructions, read all the reviews, and ventured away from the airport hotels for this one, and you proved me right again.\nAs advertised, the owner was there preparing meals while her two helpers were the waiter and food prep staff. All three greeted me, told me about the specials, and then let me know which of the menu items they were sold out of...luckily, I am not a huge sauerkraut fan, so I did not miss out on its absence. One thing I was not informed of, but overheard at the end is that there is a tasting menu, which I made me almost eat a full second meal!\nI had the stuffed cabbage, which was just perfect, good sauce, seasoned beef with rice and tender cabbage wrapped around it. I would almost call it a Bosnian Spring Roll! Other options could have been stuffed onions, grape leaves, or bell peppers.\nThe warm pita bread had a nice herb baste and delicious flavour, especially when mixed with the cucumber sauce. \nThen, without further ado... you MUST save room for dessert. Have a Bosnian coffee and the baklava. Best. Baklava. Ever.",

The surface is not flat, there are rolling \"hills\" and various ups, downs, and sideways breaks on the putting surface.\n\nThere is a fair number of trees, so a decent amount of shade.

Live music, a lot of vendors (30+ usually), free yoga (not my thing, but lot's of people like it), such an eclectic gathering of people, and you just gotta love Tower Grove Park.\n\nI am a bit disappointed to see people complaining about it being expensive.  Yes, it actually costs a lot of money to produce things, much less make a living off of it.  And you pay more for quality.  If you can't tell the difference between produce here and the produce at the grocery store, then please have your taste buds checked. [communist] I have zero problem paying more to support small farmers and small business over a faceless conglomerate that primarly profits from being cheap and from exploitation [/communist].\n\nAnyway, I love the atmosphere here and it just a great community gathering spot.  Sometimes it's more fun to people watch than actually shop.  If you have kids, there is a nearby wading pool and playground, and there are always tons of kids around.\n\nTo top it off, the owners update their website and facebook every week to let you know what will be fresh and for sale the upcoming weekend.  And they also have recently started a farmers market downtown, which shows a major commitment to the community.  If you need a reason to get your ass out of bed before noon on Saturday, this is it.",

Their check in deal included a free soy candle tonight which I loved. I chose the lemongrass scent and can't wait to burn it at home. They have an area to create your own massage oil, lotion, and seas salts with essential oils. Had a mini-reiki session with a lady they call Tattooed Nana which was interesting and different. I'm probably missing something but there's so much packed into this little place! I'll be back for milk paint, and hopefully to score some original accents for my home.

  "text": "I will definitely go back and explore the menu more and hopefully can then move to a 4* where it probably should be.  The bar was set very high as I heard lots of great buzz about Nox but on this visit it missed just a little for me. \n\nThe service was best part of the night, top notch staff, server was very professional, responsive and on his game.  The staffs attire, friendliness, demeanor, etc. all are a perfect compliment to the concept and enhance the experience.    \n\nWe started with the poblano soup and although it had a great flavor it wasn't at the appropriate serving temperature, it came out tepid, lukewarm.  And the soup was served fast so its not like it was sitting around waiting to be served.  Miss. \n\nFor entrees the wife got the salmon and I had the burger.  I wasn't totally in the mood for a burger but In my opinion when a burger is on the menu at a place like this you expect it to be amazing but it fell flat for me. It was overcooked, (ordered medium rare) and it was almost well done.  It had good flavors and I am sure it would have been better had it came out medium-medium rare. Bacon and cheese were nothing special and the pretzel bun was too dry and I tossed it after a couple bites.  I also can't eat much, bun and all, so that is probably on me as burger probably eats better with the bun on every bite.  The fries were good but nothing special.  Had to ask for an aioli to fun it up and the chipotle aioli was tasty.\n\nThe wife's salmon was tasty, loved the chili flavors and brussel sprouts, different enough from the usual salmon dish so that one scored big.  Was a little overcooked though. Was too full for desert but maybe next time.\n\nA suggestion on a way they could improve upon the experience is making better use of the space and decor in the back.  The place has a great ambiance when you walk in but it loses everything in the back where we were seated. I would like to see better decor in the back and you have to do something with that big empty space in the middle.  I know its a weird shape back there but need to get some fung shway going. Our table was against the wall and then next to us a huge empty space with visibility into all the server areas.  And a big plant that the servers bumped into every time they went back there. There is also a a very awkward 2 top in the corner along the bench seating.  \n\nI am picturing consolidating the server stations to one in the very back and putting in two big butchers block tables and seat family style.  And/or wrap the bar around and create some fun seating out of that like a breakfast bar/nook with just one butcher block.  \n\nI think the decision makers could get some great ideas from this place http://holeman-finch.com/ it reminded me of what Nox could be.  Same deal they are in a strip mall with a weird shaped space.  It would seriously be worth a quick trip to Atlanta to check it out and have a great dining experience while there.  With a few tweaks like holeman and finch Nox could be a home run.",

The gal that took my order was friendly and efficient, though she quoted my total due incorrectly twice, but it was funnier than bothersome.  She told me that the pizza would be ready within 5 minutes.  I took a seat and before the seat was warm my name was being called to pickup the pizza.  I cooked the pie for 14 minutes (recommended is 12-18), which cooked it perfectly.  There were plenty of toppings, cheese and a nice golden brown crust.  The only knock on the pie was the sauce, which had issues with consistency of spices.  Of the few slices that we had, we would occasional get a heavy dose of Italian spices.  I love spice in my sauce, but it was a bit overwhelming.  We will go back for the deal, as there isn't a better pizza deal in town, when you just want something quick to make at home.",

  "text": "I finally made it back for a \"regular\" visit. The last time I was here was for the Elite dinner and I gave it a 5 star review. Today I was not as satisfied with the service or the food. \n\nI arrived around 2pm to meet a friend for some lunch. I believe the hostess saw us, but we actually had to ask her for a table. We were not greeted at all. We did have the option to sit on the patio and so we decided to do that; we both love patios! The hostess brought us to a table, placed the menus down, told us about brunch (which runs until 3pm on Sundays), and walked away. I didn't get the sense that she wanted to be there. A few minutes passed by and no one came to our table...then a few more minutes passed and finally a guy showed up to take our drink order; he was not going to be our server though. Our drinks came out and our server showed up. He was friendly once he arrived so things got better. \n\nWe placed our orders ordered some beer and waited for our food. The food arrived in a good amount of time. I was a little disappointed in my meal and I know my friend was as well. I'll start with my order; goat cheese and strawberry salad with grilled chicken. The salad looked like it was drenched in salad dressing. I completely forgot to ask for my dressing on the side and didn't want to send it back. I like dressing so it was ok, but not everyone is like me and that amount of dressing may have been discouraged another customer. The chicken was really tough and dry! For a grilled chicken I was expecting it to me juicy and flavorful; it wasn't. I was disappointed in the overall salad. My friend ordered the steak salad; medium well. When the salad was brought out she too complained about the amount of dressing; maybe we both should have ordered the dressing on the side? Oh, and her steak she said was tough and more like well done. The kitchen missed the ball on this one. I don't think we will recommend the salads in the future. For the prices of the salads I know we were both expecting something better! Each salad was about $15! Whoa! \n\nOur server did offer bread and was attentive throughout the meal, so he gets some major Kudos! Good job Mike! I just think the kitchen has some work to do. The food has potential if it is done correctly.",

It's Philly!\n\nRight now I'm a fan of Enterprise. I can hear you scoffing, but $9.99 weekends are heaven for me. I can rent a car for the whole weekend and do all the things I want to do like .... go car shopping so I can stop coming to freakin' Enterprise.  \n\nThe best part of the $9.99 weekends is that even if the Enterprise close to you isn't participating, you can RETURN the car at any Enterprise location. Awesome. So I returned mine here and this branch was nicer than the one I rented it from. It was warm, smelled clean, and didn't look depressing at all. The guy was a little too enthusiastic for a Monday morning. I think he saw me check-in on Yelp! because he held out his hand and was like \"Please tell me you're a satisfied customer and we did everything we could for you today!\" in this fake boisterous robotic voice. Scared the s*** out of me. Almost docked them one star for the ass-kissing, but realized quickly, it could have been worse. He could have \"kept it real\" and treated me like ass because it's early on a Monday morning, but he didn't. He put on his best fake smile. And you know what? Thanks guy. Firm handshake back!",

  "text": "How have I not reviewed the Range yet? \n\nOne of the few \"Bailey's\" restaurants you'll find around STL. The biggest thing I love about these places is the \"Farm-to-table\" food. Menus revolving around the season, locally sourced meats for the burgers, and heck, even the tap beer selection is local! I enjoy the selection of unique beef, bison or even goat burgers, as well as trying the variety of dipping sauces for your fries. You feel like you are dining in a cleaned up barn while here...and I mean that in a good way. The decor appears to have been salvaged parts of farm houses and barns. Adding to the home on the range feeling and something I've never seen anywhere else (other than an Amish family restaurant) is the long \"family-style\" table running through the middle of the building. It encourages sitting next to strangers and making new friends! I love it. \n\nBefore arriving, they do not take reservations, so don't bother. Also, parking is on the street if you can find a spot. Otherwise there are plenty of lots and garages within walking distance.\n\nEnjoy!",

Although I don't think the floor has been swept in a while. So, the food was meh. Really meh. The eggs were not scrambled soft as we ordered. So, we didn't eat them. My daughter ordered Mac and cheese. It was thin and watery with a bread crumb topping. Tasted like a box meal. Then I ordered a sampler which comes with coffee and juice. She brings me a large juice. When I get the bill, I have a charge for a coffee and juice. The manager says, you got a large juice so I'll just give you an adjustment. No, you'll give me what I ordered. I didn't ask for a large. I asked for a juice with my sampler. I've never been here before and won't be back. How would I know this? She says if it's really a big deal for you I'll just take it off. No, it's not that it's a big deal for me. Doing what's right and not nickel and diming me is important. Hell, I'm still hungry. The fact you cleared our plates and two of us left 80% of our food on the plate should tell you something. The coffee was never hot. The pancakes were microwaved. And, so was the Mac and cheese. I only ate my bacon. My daughter had a club sandwich. We probably all should have went with the sandwich. My home fries were gross. I don't think they use seasonings at all in anything. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Love supporting mom and pop places but if your food sucks, your service should shine.",

Pretty much everything is within walking distance - even the conference center on the river front is only a 20 minute walk away. \n\nI enjoyed my stay here, and really appreciated the fact that they let me check-in at 8AM on the morning of my arrival even though check-in time is typically not until 4PM. I also loved the room that I was given (a corner room on one of the newly added floors). It was spacious and the bed was so, so comfortable. It was like sleeping on clouds, I kid you not. The only thing that kind of irked me was the separate elevator that was needed to access the top 3 floors - it made the whole commute up and down the building quite a hassle. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this Wyndham for either business or pleasure. They make things very convenient for you - with cab pickups, printing services at the front desk, etc.",

Hubby polished them off!  \nCeviche- tried the ceviche creama de Rocoto - holy smokes, so do good! Tender calamari, sweet potato and little corn things to offset the spice, wow! Try this!\nDinner- Tacu y Tacu which was similar to con con (in the Dominican world) crispy rice but this was mixed with white beans, topped with Lomo saltedo great texture, taste and the steak was tender.

I guess it really depends on a variety of things, including the day you went in, how parking was that day, how your service was, and who was the chef that day. \n\nEither way, we have been to Ru San's twice and used Groupons both times and loved our experience. I am not sure if I would return here for a full priced meal just because Nashville has so many options, and some of them cheaper than Ru San's but for half-priced these guys were great. \n\nWe loved their appetizers, especially the avocado-shrimp nacho looking thing (I cannot for the life of me remember it's name). We also really enjoyed their calamari. \n\nThe sushi is great. They have a lot of friend options and regular sushi options. Their speciality rolls are good too. \n\nWe have never run into a problem with their service. The first time we went there, we were in and out in a matter of 1-1.5 hours. The second time, we were using a Groupon and usually you cannot use it for alcohol but the waiter let my boyfriend use it for his beer anyway. That was cool of him!:) \n\nTIP: I would park with the valet at Sambuca. It is the easiest way to find parking at the Gulch and worth the dollar tip.",

Finding someone to dine with at a vegetarian restaurant can be difficult so I often find myself saying \"I'll just get a salad\" when going out to eat with friends. At Blue Sage there were many options for me and I couldn't have been more pleased.\n\nBefore I get to the food I would first like to compliment our server, Charlee. She was very kind and well educated on the menu. This is important because I can't eat gluten and get very nervous when dining at a restaurant for the first time. She made my first experience at Blue Sage fantastic!!\n\nFor starters, she offered a delicious UNSWEETENED raspberry iced tea, which is almost impossible to find! We also got an appetizer, the Tacos Verduras. The amount of texture and flavor piled high on a homemade blue corn taco was more than satisfying. I split this with a friend but was tempted to put in another order as my meal. \n\nInstead of doing that I went for the miso pumpkin soup. The miso broth was jam packed with flavor and even developed a slight creamy texture. The soup was hearty and had medium, bite sized chunks of cauliflower and pumpkin which was accompanied but the punch of flavor possessed by scallions. I was In love. \n\n\nOverall, I was extremely satisfied with the service, flavor, portions and prices. I am so excited to go back to Blue Sage and try more of their menu!",

Not sure if they have a/c there or not but to spend that kind of $$ and be uncomfortable was a bit disappointing, and had to cut my date with my friend short due to it.\n\nThe drinks are as tasty as they look/sound but again with what you get for for the price? 5/10",

I chose the silver or gold plated earrings knob and got a cute pair of dangly  sterling silver earrings designed by an artist!!! Other options were necklaces, watercolor painting, some kind of fortune cookie and many more. All in all, it was a great way to spend the day with my family.

The grits themselves seem overcooked and a bit too creamy to me, but their menu does describe them as \"slow cooked,\" so I assume this finish is intentional.  I like my grits a bit, well, grittier.\n\nBeyond the grits, they have lots of other breakfast foods, including some good sandwiches with sausage, eggs, etc.\n\nIt's a big cafe, with plenty of tables, large and small.  The staff seems to support the fact that lots of people like to settle in and hang out a while.

The hostess was friendly but the waiter was just a plain @$$ ...pardon my language here.\n\nYup, we got the head to toe look and he walked around and talked to us with his nose pointing to the ceiling, oh, come on!! We didn't care really... all we wanted were just some fresh oysters and great beer to wash away the heat.\n\nWe ordered a dozen of the oysters and the duck liver and rabbit pate $8 with two glasses of beer (we later got a second round of beer).\n\nThe oysters came out slowly.. we almost finished our beer when they arrived. They looked grossed and not cleaned well. I understand it was 50 cents each..but they shouldn't cut corners on cleanliness especially while serving raw food plus they are a fancy restaurant..how do you expect us to come back for the pricier dinner if you can't even clean the oysters well?\n\nWe were thinking to order a couple more dozens but the fact that we tasted the debris from the oyster shucking process in each oyster PLUS the unappetizing look of the small shells sticking on the oyster' shells.. we just got turned off!\n\nThe pate was excellent and we loved the pickled cucumber etc and the warm toasted bruchetta that came with it and $8 was certainly worth the priced. We licked it clean!!\n\nWe were planning to go to Luke for a couple times during our NOLA visit and even considered going there for dinner (we watch food network and top chef masters) BUT our not-so-great first (and only) happy hour experience @ Luke left none to desire to come back.\n\nOur total tab including tax and tip was about $40... they get you on the alcohol..\n\nThe pate is a 4 to 5 stars..the oyster price is also a 5 stars, BUT the snotty service and lack of cleanliness didn't make the cut..so I'm giving Luke a fair 3 stars.",

I hate hate hate touching my food without utensils so when I go to a seafood place, I want to go to one where I can get dirty and not feel judged.  My boyfriend and I got a whole crab and whole lobster.  They came with some sides and with two drinks it came out to be about $95, which is decent for the size of our fresh, steamed crustaceans.  The menu/prices are written on the chalkboards above the bar area.  The atmosphere was great and the service was good. I would definitely come back and recommend to others.",

  "text": "Face it, people -- you don't go to IHOP for gourmet or ambiance, you go for a heaping stack of good old carbs! And do carbs ever disappoint? Personally, not at IHOP. It's one of my top 5 places for comfort food. Just gimme a big stack of those old-fashioned buttermilk pancakes and lay on the syrup! Yeah, I'm an easy girl to please, but don't tell anyone else that.\n\nI have and always will love pancakes. And I always used to lament that Edmonton paled in comparison to Vancouver (Burnaby specifically) because we did not have an IHOP. (There's something odd when you don't much care about the ocean and the mountains but more for pancakes) So when the fiance and I were driving back from the airport one night on Calgary Trail, I gasped and found myself literally unable to speak after seeing the billboard announcing that IHOP was finally coming to Edmonton. My fiance was freaked out of his mind, as he thought there was something wrong as he was driving.\n\nNo matter what time of day it is, morning, noon or evening, I will exercise my right to have pancakes. So naturally, my first meal here was a dinner of pancakes. That's normal enough, right? If you're a fellow pancake-lover and have a sweet tooth, I recommend getting the Tooti-Fruiti (I'm so not making that name up), which comes with strawberry pieces and strawberry sauce drizzled on top. If your sugar tastebuds don't rule your mouth, go for a combination instead. You can choose your type of pancakes and throw them together with the classic side choices of bacon, sausage links, eggs, or hashbrowns. I'm going to be honest and admit their scrambled eggs are not so great --they're pretty much some kinda pre-mixed egg liquid they pour into the frying pan and stir up, i.e. not fresh.\n\nBut you don't go to IHOP for the eggs! You go for the pancakes ... they're not called The International House of Pancakes for nothing! If you plan on going, avoid Sunday afternoons as it is mayhem. We attempted going one Sunday around 1:30 PM and the waiting area was packed. One woman walked out muttering, \"It's not worth it.\" So be forewarned! But have fun, stuff your face, and get your pancakes on :)",

Nice crispy chicken, always ready on time. $15 for a 6 piece, but it's enough to feed both me and my husband. \n\nThey will only include sauce if you ask for it.

  "text": "Pancake Pantry is one of those restaurants that your family considers its own. The one you know you'll be eating at on vacation, every time you visit that city/town. The kind of homey, nostalgic place that you elevate to greatness in your mind and speak of with reverence.\n\nThe fluffy pancakes, in what seem to be a gazillion forms, are the main attraction. I love the blueberry variety with its warm, fruit compote. I'm also a fan of a Frankenstein creation which involves breakfast potatoes (not hashed browns), veggies, multiple cheeses, ham (which I sub for mushrooms), and two eggs. A meal that lasts most of the day into early evening. My mom's new obsession is the banana walnut cakes which she says taste like banana bread in pancake shape.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the large portion size and service is very prompt. They want to get you in and out with a smile so the line can keep moving right up until their afternoon closing time. I've never left hungry and never needed to have to much after a breakfast here.\n\nHaving said that, the Pantry (we use one name after all these years) isn't perfect. Parking in Hillsboro Village is challenging - it's right in the middle of a busy hub of shops, restaurants, hospitals, and Vanderbilt. The wait can be obnoxious - on this last trip we stood (yes, stood, they do it old school here) in line for over an hour on a Friday at 11 am. However, neither of these things has ever deterred us from going. It must be love!",

But there may be a disclaimer, I came on a very rainy day and we were practically the only customers, so there was plenty of clean seating and service was nice and fast!  I ordered the ginger chicken and broccoli with brown rice.  The rice was very plain but I thought the ginger sauce was yummy and the broccoli was very good.  Nice huge crispy chunks.  The chicken was also tender and well made.  Not tough or chewy or any mystery bites like you get at sketchy Chinese places.  I used the red pepper spicy sauce that they provide at the condiment counter, I love that stuff, gave my food a nice kick.  I went in not expecting much considering the whole Chinese chain ordeal, but I had a good experience.  Fast service and hot yummy food.",

After going to the amazing Pierre's, I wandered into this place because I wanted a cheap tube of white greasepaint. That's it. To my amazement they carried ben nye makeup as well-- all marked up about 3 -5 dollars more than the place I was previously at. Super lame. However they do carry woochie prosthetics which is really cool.  \n\nAfter I found the greasepaint, I went to go over to the line... which went from the registers wrapped around an aisle, and snaked to the back of the store. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Luckily, it only took me about 5 - 10 minutes to get to the front. I promptly checked out, and went outside only to notice there was now a line to get INTO the store. It went down the building towards the awesome bagel place.\n\nAll I know for sure is the day after halloween, they better discount the shit out of their inventory so I can go crazy with cheesy home decorations.

  "text": "So I usually hate Yelp reviews that rant about the service. Because, I honestly think that if you're a true food lover, you wouldn't give a rats behind about service. Really good food speaks for itself. And it you wanted to be a big baby and spoon feed, you would have went to your mama's place. So with that aside, let's talk about Germantown Pub.\n\nFood isn't good. Everything I've had here has been frozen and reheated/refried. From the fries to the catfish to the chicken tenders. Nothing here is made fresh in-house. So expect things to be overseasoned and oversalted to cover up for lack of freshness. And let's not forget how dry the food usually is. Like your great aunt's cooch, this food hasn't been moist in ages. \n\nThe real insult to injury was the service our group received tonight. Our group of 12 came here for trivia which is actually really fun. And we're not the standard a-holes that move from our original seats, make tons of modifications to the menu and confuse our server. \n\nSo, I was pretty freaking shocked when the server asked me what \"number you were\" like I was cattle or standing in line at the DMV when I tried to order another beer. When I asked her to clarify, she stated \"I gave you a number when you sat down.\" Um no, you didn't because I would have actually asked you what you mean by number. I've worked in to service industry before so I understand large groups may be difficult but ultimately it's your JOB to remember who orders what. Blaming the customer for your lack of memorization makes the experience uncomfortable for everyone involved. She also claimed my friend's food would \"be here in a moment\" then 20 minutes later came back and accused him of never ordering it in the first place. Like seriously, we all heard him order it and then heard you confirm his order...twice. She also told me \"don't get the Thai sauce on the chicken tenders...it's terrible.\" so I went with plain chicken tenders and just honey mustard on the side. But guess who ends up with the terrible Thai sauce on her chicken tenders, this girl. But I didn't even bother to send it back and ate my dry Thai sauced chicken tenders anyways because you can tell when things just weren't going ever be rectified. Also, not to the server's fault but due poor planning, ALL BUT ONE of the happy hour draft beers was available going into the 1st hour of trivia. Like, you guys didn't realize that as a bar on an event night you may want to have more beer available?\n\nShort summary is, come here for the trivia and good company. Expect the happy hour beer to run out. Avoid the long red-headed server. And eat dinner elsewhere beforehand.",

A cheese plate, which was served with prosciutto, high quality olive oil and bread, followed by a small plate of figs and gorgonzola. The figs were smaller and tougher than I had hoped- they seemed previously dried, not fresh. An artichoke panino came next, which we subbed goat cheese for instead of feta- delicious. We wrapped up our meal with another sandwich- dessert, this time. I recommend the caramel, banana and marscapone cheese panino over anything else on the menu. Mmm...",

It's just...forgettable.  \n\nFirst, it's cash only, as are most places in this area.  The wait for brunch on the weekends is insane and in my opinion, not worth it.  You can probably make many of their menu items at home, and save yourself some money too.\n\nWhile the decor is cute and my mom loved the granola and yogurt (which is near $7...highway robbery!), I'd suggest walking down the street to Honey's or Resurrection.  You might have to wait a bit longer, but it will be worth it.",

They also know what the hell they are talking about people!\n\nThey have a fabulous liquor and wine selection, and are eager to offer a suggestion or opinion on what they carry. Complaints... they aren't the most cost efficient place in town (though not crazily so, just noticeable) and since times have been a bit tighter financially for me lately, I feel like a bit of a bum shopping here for my box o' wine or cheap selections. \n\nYou know what I mean. I actually wanted a boxed wine recommendation (I prefer bottles but you've gotta do what you gotta do) but I noticed I wasn't approached once when I was in that area, whereas other sections will get you some customer service. Oh well, I guess it was less embarrassing to just grab my box and get the heck out of there before I was judged too harshly. \n\nBut I do love shopping here, especially if I can afford something of the nicer variety!",

It seems like most of the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.\nShe let us try one bite of everything they had to offer in little sample cups. There is a wide variety of flavours, very spicy to very mild. \n\nThe chutneys are something you should avoid if you do not like spicy food. They will also offer you some yogurt-sour cream sauce stuff if you are a big wimp, or accidentally put chutney in your mouth and it is now burning and numb at the same time and you are desperate for relief.\n\nI really liked the butter chicken, and opted to order that. My boyfriend ordered the chicken curry but I forget what it was called. Both tasted great and were very filling, I even had enough leftovers for lunch the next day. He horked it down to fast for leftovers. We also bought a lemony dessert ball thing. It was yummy, if you see a lemony dessert ball thing being offered by the register you should try it. \nWe also bought naan. We did not like the naan and threw it away, it was tough and sort of chewy and singed. We did come right before close though, so this could simply be because it wasnt fresh naan? My other thought is that I would love if I could add some mixed vegetables or something to the curry, because it is sauce and meat only. I know that is not exactly traditional, but it would be nice to have the option IMO",

  "text": "I am not known for my meat-eating abilities. Pampa nearly killed me. I don't like bacon (seriously, I know - please keep reading, I promise I will redeem myself one day). I am more of a starchy, carby kind of person. When it comes to most meats, I'm sort of... .indifferent. Sometimes I even willingly choose to eat tofu. But whenever someone suggests to go eat at Sloppy Hoggs, I'm all for it. In fact, I'm the one driving. And cheering as I drive.\n\nI was initially very wary of going for BBQ due to all of the above. But going into Sloppy Hoggs, I got a great first impression. The restaurant is clean, very minimal and laid out nicely. It is a rather small space (and at times it can be near impossible to get a table) but the smell of meat emanating through the restaurant is amazing (AND doesn't cloak you in meat cologne stench).\n\nMy significant other is the polar opposite of me - huge meat eater, lover of bacon, barbequed anything, red meat monster. I went because of him and watched him consume a huge platter of pulled pork. I was a little daunted but I ordered The Cure, which I had to admit I thoroughly enjoyed. Fried egg, amazing waffles, pulled pork, bacon (which I even ate!), some sort of sweet sauce, flavor, flavor, more flavor and sweet potato fries. So good.\n\nSo we went again. And then I tried the pulled pork. Then we went again and I had the chicken. And the cornbread. And honestly, it has never disappointed me, other than the days when they literally couldn't give us a table due to multiple reservations and lack of seating (and this has happened several times). But that blip aside, we keep coming back. It's just that good. For a bacon-fanatic, meat lovin place, I, the meat-indifferent, love it all the same. Bravo, Sloppy Hoggs, bravo.",

The cashier was really friendly. It took about 10 minutes to get the ice cream. The atmosphere is super casual. The only downside that I found was that there weren't enough seats/tables to accommodate all the customers.

The parking lot is a bit tight but we were able to get a spot - it was the holiday season though, and I think it probably gets a little more hectic during a usual work week.  Something to keep in mind.\n\nOur waitress was so sweet and helpful.  The food was great and presented beautifully - the dishes they used were all so cool that I wanted to take them home (I think the waitress was laughing at me a little as I oohed and ahhed over everything).  Loved the décor as well, from the tables to the seat cushions to the artwork on the walls. It's not a large space, but it's not too small either.  Overall, there's a really cool vibe in the place.\n\nThe food was really good - we tried a bunch of stuff.  We started with the fried vegetable spring rolls (two per order - we should have gotten two orders, or maybe they should add one more?  it wasn't enough of an appetizer for three people). My daughter enjoyed her sushi platter (it came with a nice little salad) and my husband liked his ramen soup.  I had a steak teriyaki platter which came with some really good rice and sautéed veggies (I actually ate my meal with chopsticks - first time ever!  So what if I had to stab the steak pieces!?!).  My meal also came with a cup of miso soup - it was good but I just don't see what's so special about miso soup.\n\nWe ended the meal with the green tea snow ice which was tasty - the interesting part was the sweet beans that are served along with it.  Yes, actual beans - sort of like baked beans with the sugar but not the BBQ flavor.  It was served on a bed of mangos or peaches - we couldn't figure out which.\n\nWe really enjoyed our experience at Kawa. You should definitely check it out sometime...  I think it will be around for a long time.",

I came here with a group of friends this weekend (6 of us total) because I didn't want to try getting in at one of the usual brunch spots and having to wait for hours. Seating was easy, and we pushed together a few tables to accommodate everyone.\n\nHowever, the food choices are a little strange and not extremely descriptive. I split the jalepeno cornbread and the mushroom frittata with my boyfriend. Both main items were extremely small (like 5 bites) and came with a small arugula side salad. All the flavors were just okay. For $9 each, I felt like the price point wasn't quite right, especially for this neighborhood. One friend ordered a green tea cupcake that came out very hard and dry, like it had been made days ago. The best-looking dish by far was a vegan sandwich off the lunch menu. \n\nI was happy with my latte and happy with the ambiance, but this place isn't in my 'hood and I honestly probably won't be back.

As soon as you walk in the aromas of the spices hit you like a wall.  Although pleasing to me and many others it might not be your cup of tea. A definite gourmet of spices and great cooking ideas. I could not just choose one. They even have genuine extracts. Not just vanilla, but butterscotch, espresso and rum. The blend of spices and seasonings which many have testers. You can sniff and taste before you buy which is right up my alley. They have a decent selection of pepper spices, chilli powders from all over and even some gourmet curries. Pink salt if that's your thing to dried hot peppers to cinnamon. Their grilling rubs sound delicious. They are moderately to run of the mill price some are expensive depending on what you pick. But a grocery store can sell you a watered down version of curry powder for 5 bucks and less than 3 oz. Why not pay a little extra and get a damn amazing curry powder that has flavor. Definitely worth a stop in you never know what flavors await..",

The only lot we could find was $18, which was ridiculous considering we only wanted to walk around for an hour or so. We ended up parking across the street at Cracker Barrel and walking over. It's not a long haul, but it's not short either. (We might have been better off staying where we'd parked for the Opry, not sure.)\n\nOnce we got into the Gaylord Opryland, though, we were SO glad we came. We started in the main lobby with the waterfalls, then went through to the next section with the gazebo and gardens, then continued past the pool to the Delta atrium, with its river, restaurants, and dancing fountain. Each section was absolutely lovely, like a small (climate-controlled) paradise. Between our two cameras, we must have taken a few hundred photos.\n\nAfter walking around for over an hour, we decided to sit and relax at a bar/cafe in the first section (just off the main lobby). Though we didn't try anything off the menu (because we had reservations at the Bluebird Cafe) it did look very tasty and reasonably priced.\n\nWe all agreed we would love to come back someday, possibly to stay in the hotel, possibly just to walk around at night or at the holidays when things were lit up.",

The avocados and tomatoes were so under-ripe I had to go to Safeway after to finish my shopping, and items that I had been hoping would be of better quality/freshness than a grocery store (i.e. green beans, red peppers) were just as sad and uninspiring as anything at Sobey's or Safeway.  \n\nWhen ringing up my purchases, the cashier keyed in at least three of my items incorrectly, perhaps more while I was getting my wallet and bags out.  Given that H & W is an extra 10 minute drive from home, the produce wasn't anything special and that I couldn't wait to escape the crowded cramped aisles, I won't be back - the experience wasn't worth the few dollars savings.",

My friend described it perfectly: good food, good prices, but the place smells of their cooking so be prepared to smell like brunch. Heeding her warning, we opted to sit outside. Luckily it was a nice day. \n\nWe looked over the menu and then placed our orders inside. I opted for the vegetarian egg white omelette with lots of vegetables! Loved the spinach and avocado! They also have several beverage options. I chose coffee and the peach mango smoothie. Cool and refreshing. \n\nThe prices are good and staff is friendly. Effoc's does smell like their food on the inside though. Not a negative, just a comment.",

  "text": "I don't really understand the fascination with Han Dynasty. My friend and I came for dinner and neither of us were impressed. \n\nThe spice/heat rating attached to the foods is ridiculous. Really, a scale of 1 to 10? Anything above 5 is hot enough to make you not able to taste any of your food, so what's the point?\n\nThe steamed dumplings had hardly any meat in them at all. Literally it was like the size of a nickel, and they were covered in chili oil. Actually, that's really my main complaint with all of the food, it's just covered in chili oil. I love chili oil and cook with it all the time, but just dousing food in it really isn't good cooking. \n\nMy meal and my friend's meal were both just OK. She got the garlic sauce style and I got the double cooked style. Again, both were floating in chili oil.\n\nThe only real reason this place stuck out above the rest was with it's staff - they were very friendly, if not borderline overbearing.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars because nothing was \"bad,\" but I'd never go here again when there are so many other places I have yet to try.",

  "text": "I lived in Atlanta for 16 years and I have been to Zaxby's several times. My friends that went to UGA in Athens, GA love this place. I think they have a good quality product, and generally speaking a clean environment.  I tried the location on Waters and Dale Mabry and the product is consistent.\n\nThey have a plate called Wings and Things. I supersized it and had a bunch of wings, chicken tenders, French fries, celery and Texas toast. I paid around $10 and it was definitely a lot of food. The chicken tenders were excellent!!! great flavor, moist and...well, tender. The chicken wings were really good, they have 9 different flavors and I went with the Tongue torch, equivalent to a Buffalo sauce. I'd have them again.\nFrench fries....good, toast... good.\n\nIn an objective review I would give them 4 stars. I believe the price for the wings is more consistent with that of a larger restaurant where you get full service; although they make an effort to have a nice décor inside, it's really a fast food restaurant.\n\nNow...what's up with that poster at the entrance of the Serengeti in Africa and a feline violently biting into a Zebra? I thought that was a little disturbing. My ex is vegetarian and I used to go with her to Zaxby's and she would have a grilled cheese. If she would have gotten to this store we would have had to turn around and look for some other place. This is an opinion and a very personal judgment that might not affect other customers. \n\nI would recommend their chicken tenders and their wings, and I can see myself at the Drive Thru picking some up again.",

Well, we just got our first in that category and I'm impressed. \n\nI love that it's large enough that you don't have to wait to get gas because all the pumps are full. More importantly, I'm embarrassed to say, the convenient mart is a pretty fun shopping experience.\n\nThey have it all - a big selection of booze with an entire walk-in beer case. They have pre-made sandwiches/salads/wraps that look every bit as good as something you'd get at the Schnucks or Dierbergs deli. For breakfast, you can get fresh donuts, sourdough breakfast sandwiches, etc. They have every darn kind of fountain drink that you could possibly want - including an Icee machine that you can fill with your own flavor choice (!) and some kind of ice cream shake machine. Unbelievably, they have some staples like a small selection of produce and an impressive selection of breads. They also have healthy car treats, packed in containers that fit into your cup holder. What haven't they thought of?\n\nThe customer service is ridiculous too. You are always greeted by someone when you walk in. Do these people know that they work in a gas station? Every last one of them has been pleasant on every stop.\n\nSo, here...I've gone and reviewed a gas station and gave it 5 stars. And I don't care because it's pretty freaking cool, as far as gas stations go. Welcome to South City!",

Cool, gotta go back to Preservation Hall . . .\n\nPreservation Hall is probably unlike any other place in the world.  N'Awlyns is acknowledged as the birthplace of Jazz, and The Hall is a living musical history of that era.  All the way down to the building, a dirty-looking hole-in-the-wall that you'd want to pass by if you didn't know what is in there.  Pay your admission, crowd your way in, and listen to the musicians blow.\n\nI was in town for Jazz Fest, so I felt like I had to go here, otherwise I'm missing something.  The set was only three songs long, and I knew only \"Back Home Again In Indiana\", but it was still a top experience.  The music was very good, and you could tell that the musicians loved what they were doing.  It felt like I was back at the turn of the *last* century.\n\nI'd want my daughter to hear this in person, but I clicked NOT good for kids.  Waiting in line in humid Crescent City, then standing the whole time in a stuffy room, makes for cranky kids.  Bad for them, bad for the parents, bad for the audience.  I'm sure there's a similar place like this in this city that's more suitable for them with all that jazz.\n\nYou can get recordings of the same music and same personnel, but it's not like seeing them in person at Preservation Hall.  Actually, Café du Monde is also a must-do, but if you can do only one of those, I'd say to choose Preservation Hall.\n\nBig laugh:  When I went, there was a small sign up:\nREQUESTS: $1\nPOPULAR SONGS:  $2\nSAINTS:  $5\nIn other words, if you insist on them playing \"When The Saints Go Marching In\" yet again, it's gonna cost ya!",

Although, it is hard not to be busy in a place that is so, in a word, Lit-tle. With seating for around 30, not the most comfortable in the world, mind you, it does well to have a reservation if you are going to be a guest.  The Italian menu reads like Lit-erature (I know, I couldn't help it!), sparkling with Italian classics such as antipastos, olives, flat breads and pastas.  The wine list is excellent as well, as one would expect from a venue de vino. The deconstructed environment is sparsely decorated with a few paintings and Lit-hographs (I swear, that is the last one) by local artists.\n\nSo go fall in love with Lit.

I've always enjoyed coming here and I have to insist that the original menu and it's variations for the first few years were much better than it is now.  They're going through some changes and it's painful.  \n\nI had come here in December and had a terrible meal and the GM invited us back to try them again.  I was kinda thinking that before he wrote me that it had been my last visit.  We ate here last night and had a very good experience.  Of course, we received some special attention (the service last time wasn't good) last night was terrific.  We liked everything but the duck dish.  Even the oysters, still not nearly the best in NOLA, were decent.  \n\nI liked the burrata salad a lot, it's really well balanced and was perfectly dressed.  Miriam's Luke salad similarly so but over salted.  Still edible but over salted.  \n\nI liked her shrimp and grits a lot.  Too shrimpy for me, not my thing, but I appreciated it anyway.  She loved it.  I liked the grits and sausage.  The duck dish is too much.  Too sweet, too rich, too much rice, too salty.  It's cloying in the end.  The duck was prepared perfectly and it was delicious.  I loved the texture and preparation of the rice too.  I doubt anyone finishes this dish.  1/3rd of the rice, a little more confit and maybe a small pile of those great Brussels sprouts on the side would be perfect.  \n\nWe love their French press so we finished with some coffee and some of the best creme brûlée in NOLA.  The biscotti is a complete miss.  Heavy and made by someone who doesn't have a clue.  These are easy to make, by the way.  \n\nHere's a big problem though.  It's a corporate restaurant.  Upper management here is ruining this place.  They're still serving the worst bread in NOLA, they know it, and are still serving it.  When you have people making decisions for your restaurant who don't work there and don't know anything about food you're in trouble.  It's just about the money.  It makes it impossible to create and execute a clear vision about the food your serving and why you're serving it.  How can you serve a product you know is bad and do it anyway?  Can't be 4 stars until they decide that their staff can make decisions about the food and they focus their vision about what the heck this place is supposed to be about.  Says a lot about the Besh group.... sadly.",

We had a favorite restaurant we would go to often so when we moved here earlier this year we wanted to find a new favorite. We tried St Yared and that experience left us disappointed. Our experience here was a complete 180!\n\nService 3/5\nService was as expected. Our waitress was friendly and got our order right. The restaurant wasn't super busy but I had to flag her down a couple times because she just didn't check on us very often, not a huge deal though. Our food didn't take too long and it was hot when we go it.\n\nAtmosphere/Ambiance 3/5\nThe restaurant feels very dated and not very warm. But it was clean and the seats were comfortable enough. They also have a bottle of hand sanitizer at each table which is nice. This is probably a strange thing to mention but they had an electronic sign at the back of the restaurant that blinked between the word \"coffee\" and the picture of a coffee mug in neon colors and that was fairly distracting actually. Next time I'll try to remember to sit on the opposite side of the table, my husband isn't bothered by things like that as much as I am!\n\nFood 5/5\nLet's be honest, we didn't come here for the service or the atmosphere, we came here for the food and the food was most definitely the star of the show! We got our usual entrees...my husband got the Kitfo and I got the beef Awaze Tibs (mild) and both were absolutely delicious! They tasted exactly the same as what we got at our favorite restaurant in Arlington. We are beyond excited and will absolutely be back!",

On a whim, my bf suggested we try the Centennial.  Recalling that a co-worker of mine ALWAYS brought tasty-looking danishes and muffins to work from Centennial, I wholeheartedly agreed to give it a try.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and grits. I loved it! It was served PIPING HOT with mushrooms, onions, tomatos, and cheese and of course, grits. it reminded me of a cajun dish like shrimp creole or jambalaya.  I wish they served something else with it though, because after a while, you do need something else to break up that taste.   My bf shared his french toast with me, which solved that problem.\n\nHe ordered french toast, eggs, turkey sausage links, and potatos w/ onions and peppers. To drink, he had a hazelnut steamer and I had my usual cup of darjeeling with cream and sugar.\n\nThe only complaint I have with this place is that they are slightly overpriced.  My breakfast was 12.95, and his was $12.95. Our grand total was $33.oo, which I think is a lot for breakfast.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this place and will be returning.",

Although I love Kalyra wines, I think this place is fun because they have so much of a variety, with wine and beer flights.  They have a traditional beer tastings, as well as fruit beers.  You can apply the flight price to your wine/beer purchase, which is always a plus.  \n\nThe flights are pretty affordable (normal for the area), with a range of options for different prices (i.e., chardonnay/white tastings are cheaper than some cab/red tastings).  \n\nThis is the best place to take a group, even if they are newbies to the wine/beer tasting world.  The location is great - take a walk along the coast after you taste!\n\nThe only reason I give this place four stars instead of five, is because the staff weren't the friendliest.

  "text": "Fantastic location if you want to be close to Broadway & the downtown sights. The staff were all so friendly & accommodating & went the extra mile by providing area suggestions & assisting us in renting & parking our car (special shout-out to Andrea for her helpfulness (I hope I remembered her name correctly!)). Our room was on the 13th floor (I thought all hotels skipped the 13th floor?) & had recently been remodeled. I loved, LOVED the fact they used faux wooden flooring instead of the typical carpet (I hate carpet, it's so dirty & grosses me out!) & they did a great job on the bathroom, particularly the beautiful shower & the makeup light around the mirror. The hotel provides ample complimentary Aveda toiletries (shampoo/conditioner, body lotion, mouthwash, etc) as well as a sewing kit, cotton balls & swabs, & makeup remover wipes- all very impressive in my opinion, as I've never seen so many complimentary items in one hotel room before. There is a nice bar area downstairs & although they do not have a separate restaurant, they do have a pretty decent menu to order from & you can enjoy your meal at the bar or in the ample seating/lounge area. They also keep a constant rotation of complimentary pastries & cookies in the front desk area so that was another nice touch offered by Hotel Indigo. I like how they've kept some of the original features of the building in their design, such as the big windows & the mail shoot found across from the elevators on each floor. I highly recommend Hotel Indigo Nashville if you're going to be visiting the area.",

  "text": "Tutti Toscani has been a south jersey favorite of mine for a long, long time... Even predating my yelp reviewing days (feeling nostalgic!). I've hosted a baby shower here and was so incredibly impressed with how accommodating the staff was and how incredible our service was.\n\nI was here last night with my family and was not disappointed one but. We started with the family style appetizer, with fried calamari, fried zucchini and mussels in red. All were Perfectly prepared and the portions were appropriate for sharing.\n\nFor my main course I had the fettuccine bolognese, which had generous helpings of ground meat. My mom had the eggplant rollatini served with spinach ravioli.  Both were delicious, and I was impressed with the spinach ravioli- you could really taste the spinach!! My dad had the mussels as clams and considering he left nothing but a bunch of empty shells in his bowl, I'm guessing he was satisfied.\n\nI didn't get to try my brother (penne al vodka) or sister in law (rigatoni with chicken, sausage and broccoli rabe)'s dishes but looked and smelled delicious and I saw some happy-food-dances going on, mid-consumption.\n\nOh! I forgot out the bread! How can I forget the heaping basket of fresh rolls and tomato pie that we were greeted with!? Nothing but love for that basket. \n\nThis is a Byob in the heart of South Jersey that you won't want to miss out on.",

  "text": "Wonderful little neighborhood coffee shop.  I have yet to try the food, but I would love to if it worked out.  The coffee / espresso is delicious and not overpriced.  \n\nI do have to recommend the Vanilla Chai though- it's spectacular.  \n\nThey have plenty of space inside and out to sit and study or just relax.  I was using LaVa as a study break from my house for a little while and always felt very comfortable.  They have a water cooler which is nice too.  Baristas are very sweet.\n\nA little note that made me like this place even more is that although they have a $10 minimum for payments made by CC- they suggested I get a $10 gift card and use it so I'll have a \"free\" coffee next time I come in.  I'm not sure why other places with minimums don't suggest this as well!  It worked for me :)",

  "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time given the stellar yelp reviews. After finally squeaking through the door last night just before 8 pm, I can now say I agree with its good reputation! It is truly a gem in the neighborhood. I love that it is BYOB. At ~6.50 a plate, Sky Cafe boasts street food prices, but the dining area is nicer than I expected given the cheap prices: it's clean, comfortable, and well-decorated. Although my friend had to take my order over the phone at 7:45 as I rushed there before closing, the waiter was patient and excellent at recommending a vegetarian dish I would enjoy. He was very helpful and polite and he never made us feel rushed.\n\nNow, on to the food. Everything was fresh and arrived speedily to the table. My friends both got the Mie Kepiting (homemade egg noodles with crab meat). The noodles were phenomenal; a delightful and unique combination of texture and flavor. The noodles and crab meat are in one bowl, and the broth is served on the side, so you can pour it in to suit your ideal ratio of noodles: broth. I got the Nasi Urap with what were described to me as \"stinky beans\" (I did not find them very stinky at all, which is a good thing). The beans came in a rich, spicy, coconutty sauce that I absolutely adored. The plate came with a nest of assorted crispy fried vegetables, which complimented the texture of the beans and rice perfectly. I was a little disappointed there were not more vegetarian items on the menu, considering the many vegan options available at other Indonesian restaurants in the area, but apparently they can make several dishes to order, so I would love to come back and try a vegetarian version of the noodles if they have it.\n\nI'm so glad I finally tried this place! I'll be back for sure.",

  "text": "I've been a fan of Nino's for a very long time. I don't make it there very often since I moved away from p-town.\n\nStory time:\nBack in the day when they first opened  ('96-ish) my high school friends and I would go here. Often we didn't have the cash so we'd split plates. Nino (the owner) would see us doing this and would give us extra food because \"growing kids have got to eat!\".  \n\nDuring this time my mom had cancer so when she'd actually feel like eating I'd call in a pickup order for her. He'd tell me to stay home and take care of my mom and he'd have his kitchen help run down the street to my house to hand deliver it. \"Fresh food help you feel better fast 'eh?\"\n\nSeveral years later when one of the high school gang died suddenly my hubs and I stopped by Nino's after the funeral. After he heard what happened he refused to let us pay for lunch and then poured us two very large glasses of red wine. \n\"Some times wine and a full stomach makes bad things a bit easier\" \nYes Nino, yes it does.\n \nI love Nino... he's a character and a very very nice guy.\n\nThe restaurant used to be a toddle house when I moved to the 'hood. Nino redid it into a cafeteria style Italian restaurant. It's smallish with 4 or 5 tables on the inside and 4 tables on the outside. Daily he picks 2-3 dishes and makes them from scratch. Everything is very very fresh.  Watching him make the bread and dough is pretty awesome.\n\nOf the cafeteria style dishes I love  the lasagna and the veal parmesan. \nAs for the other stuff they have..OMG the philly cheese steak. It's probably not a real proper philly cheese steak since we're not in philly but so so tasty. Nino makes it fresh on the grill and pairs it with bread he bakes.\nThe pizza! Nino's pizza will ruin you for all other pizza. He makes his own dough and sauce. I've watched my hubs put away a whole  pizza all by himself and they are NOT small just very very good.  Nino actually knows the difference between stromboli and a calzone. Dat stromboli yo.\n\nExtra parking on the side and rear. Does not take cards.\n\nMommy notes: Nino loves talking to kids. Always gives plenty of napkins. Small inside so leave the stroller in the car. Bring cash. Clean bathrooms.",

  "text": "Solid brunch place in Tucson. \n\nLet me preface this review by disclosing that my usual stomping grounds are Los Angeles and Scottsdale, the brunch capitals of the West.  And call me, #basic but I love brunch more than most things.  My friends and I came here because Prep and Pastry was way too crowded (1 hr wait, no thank you!) and Ghini's had none.  The interior is cute and French-themed with painted trellises, stained glass art, and artfully placed wine bottles, which would please any Francophile.\n\nI ordered the carafe of Bloody Mary, which I really enjoyed!  We got it Nola style so it was spicy, and the alcohol content was on point.  For my entree I got the spinach, ham and swiss crepe.  Not mind blowing but definitely not bad. I had some of my friend's croque madame. also not bad.  The stand out of this meal was definitely the bloody mary.\n\nThey were more than happy to accommodate for all the outside requests we had.  One of my friends is notoriously picky and always customizes her order.  the servers at Ghini's took it in stride.\n\nThe best part of this cafe is that you can split the check really really easily!  I wish the brunch spots in LA would adopt this policy.  Added on a whole star for the ease of this payment scheme.  You just go to the front, tell the cashier what you ordered and you pay for it. \n\nThere is also a bakery appended to the other side of the cafe.  They sell macarons, cookies, huge pull apart cinnamon rolls, and tarts.  The cookie I got was ok.",

While I don't find it professional, I decided to give it another go today. The yogurt was very tasty. On point as far as cost goes. Staff was friendly enough. One thing in particular that I liked is that 80% of the toppings are in individual containers which leaves less room for cross contamination... and germs. Loved the modern decor.

When I found out that they were located in my part of town (UC), I was elated and immediately tracked them down!\n\nWhat is not to love here? I've tried everything on their menu and they're all sooooo good! \n\n+Thai short rib or chicken satay taco ($3 a piece): great flavors, not too heavy, avocados aplenty, and delicious spicy mayo sauce\n+Chicken Katsu ($5 + 50cents for egg): substantially-sized, crunchy chicken strips with rice, tomato chunks, and sesame seeds in tonkatsu sauce \n+Red veggie curry ($5): potato and pumpkin chunks with rice in a creamy curry broth, DELICIOUS. Spice level is perfect.\n+Cap'n Crunch encrusted tilapia burrito($6): slightly sweet, crunchy, and flavorful; generously portioned. Don't miss out on this one!\n+Mexican veggie burger ($4): I'm not a vegetarian but I really wouldn't miss meat if I could eat this daily. Love the spicy mayo!\n+Thai ice tea/thai green tea ($2): refreshing, not too sweet, waaay better than starbucks\n\nOwners are super gracious and friendly. They really care about their customers since they make an effort to engage in conversation with you.\n\nOnly downsides:\n-Some of their menu choices take a long time like the Tilapia, especially during the lunch rush (~15 minute wait) but totally worth it\n-Random closings. I've been here a couple of times only to find them closed. A few weeks ago, I dragged my friend after class to try my favorite food truck. We were so disappointed that we trekked all the way from Penn only to find Cucina to be closed. I wish they were a bit more consistent with their schedule.\n\nAll in all, Cucina Zapata is a safe bet for an affordable and delicious meal. I'm a huge fan!",

  "text": "My friends and I searched out Crystal BBQ with Korean Ribs in mind. That was all I wanted - some delicious korean ribs and some kimchi. We went into Crystal BBQ with fairly low expectations and came out happy.\n\nWe didn't even look at the menu - we ended up having the all you can eat barbeque dinner, which was basically just every meat they could possibly offer, cooked right in front of you. The restaurant was dead, so we had one server all to ourselves (mostly) all night to help facilitate the cooking process, as cooking on the crystal bbq was tricky (as was figuring out which meats were which, and which were cooked or not!). The menu was huge, the waitress was very friendly and just said she would bring out a little of everything and we could try what we wanted before we ordered more. We barely made it through our \"try\" of everything before we were bursting at the seams. Tons of korean beef, beef ribs, pork, bacon, marinated chicken, shrimp, you name it, we had it. And it was actually REALLY good.\n\nAlong the piles of meats, they also served up korean dishes like kimchi, potatos, salads, veggies and steamed rice. The cost was very good, I think it ended up being something like $18 a person, including soft drinks. \n\nThe restaurant is located in a rather shifty area of downtown, just east of the court houses and slightly north of Jasper. It's fairly nice inside and the staff were very accommodating and friendly. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but all of the meats we had in our dinner were seasoned just right and were super delicious. If you are looking to try out a variety of korean barbeque, I definitely recommend Crystal.\n\nONE RECOMMENDATION I HAVE: When this place gets busy and all the tables are cooking meats, the whole place can get very warm/greasy very fast. I don't recommend making this your go-to date place or dropping in for a meal before going anywhere important, because you walk out completely drenched in the smell of the restaurant. Just a tip. If you have dogs, they'll love you when you come home, if you know what I mean.",

It is a little touristy just because of the location (out on the pier) but as soon as you go upstairs to the tasting room all it is easy to forget where you are. The view is amazing. You can take your wine tasting out on the patio and just venture back in when you are ready for your next pour. The inside is lovely too, nice couches and seating + it is a little cooler on a hot day and warmer on a cool day to sit inside. \n\nThe wine is really good. I've done both the regular tasting and the reserve and enjoyed all of the wine. Pro tip: 2-for-1 tastings with the Axxess Pass. \n\nThere is a restroom in the tasting room and also a public restroom on the pier. The pier also has parking but it is an easy walk out to the Deep Sea Tasting room from the main streets of downtown Santa Barbara, so no need to move your car if you are already parked in the area.",

Besides what I thought to be a not very inspired menu, the plate presentation was weak. Everything was the same color. I know that's nitpicky but it's an expensive place and I want the food to look and taste beautiful.\n\nOur desserts (creme bruleee and a chocolate cake) were very rich, too rich for my boyfriend so I was forced to finish them for us.  No espresso, I really hate that at nice restaurants. French press is good but it's not espresso, plus it was so weak I could practically see through it.  I wasn't displeased with our dinner but I would much rather go somewhere else for the amount of money we paid.",

  "text": "Oh my Joy, the Children's Museum!!!!!!!!!! When was the last time I even went here??? I have no idea ! I've missed every Adult Swim event over the past three years and I don't have children, so I don't come properly equipped to handle loads of kids running, screaming and living their lives as I infiltrate my adult desires to play in a museum created for THEM! So I stay away. \n\nBut thanks to Yelp and Sacred Journeys, I was able to go experience a taste of #TCM! I had a great time and I hope they are planning to do it again, as I will be back.\n\nSacred Journeys started off with a complimentary drink token, to which I indulged in some red wine. From there, the open bar was $5 for drinks (Im not sure if it was an all inclusive price...they had Sun King beer and wine). There was small table with lightweight snacks for dining, but the food and drinks were not allowed into the exhibit. Pretzels, chips, hummus and pita bread, fried wontons and spinach artichoke dip and some mini pizza bagels lined up the table for guests to cure their stomach rumblings. I admit to over indulging on the pizza bites.\n\nI unfortunately only saw two of the exhibits, which means they either have to do this again OR I will have to go on my own and deal with the big laugh & play time of the children. Seeing two of the exhibits and not even in their full capacity just opened up the Pandora Children's Museum Box that now says I MUST SEE MORE!!!!! \n\nI visited Sacred Journeys, which is really incredible, interactive exhibit about five different areas of the world that people journey off to in order to celebrate their  religion. The long corridor that leads you into the exhibit has a looped video playing that gives you the synopsis of what you will see. Once you turn the corner, all colors of religion, spirituality and love shining. They even had the throne that the Dali Lama sat on in a glass encasing. Pretty cool ! I didn't see the entire exhibit as I was called away but what I did see, I loved !!! I love that the kids have a space that teaches them ABOUT religion and the differences in people, all while showing some of the most beautiful parts of the world. \n\nThe other exhibit I checked out was the Beijing exhibit which comes complete with a replica airplane that flies you into the Beijing while you feel the vibrations of the chair and see the amazing sights that you would see out your window if you were really flying. Once you get off the plane, an entire world opened up ! There was everything, themed and precise, including a grocery store, a Saigon theater, a house, restaurant and much much more. You are really allowed an authentic experience of life in Beijing if you were to travel there. Me and my group had a ball in this area playing dress up, taking pictures and learning to write calligraphy and say hello in native tongue.\n\nUpon leaving, we were asked to sign up on their email list. The ladies told us there would be more of these events in the future! I can't wait and hope they don't change their mind because what adult would not want to take a break from working and paying bills to go unwind with a glass of wine at the Children's Museum and be a kid all over again....in the midst of other adults !!!!",

  "text": "So, I hate to be a nay-sayer in the homogeneous list of 5-star reviews, but at this point, I find Village Whiskey just \"A-OK\".  That's not a bad thing, but I was decidedly underwhelmed.  I had been hearing the burger raves for months, but had also heard about the 2-hour waits.  I had been waiting for just the perfect occasion, and it came on a random Wednesday afternoon at 3:30 while entertaining an out of town friend.  \n\nGarces has done a very nice job with the space, and has achieved a classy, old-school bar vibe.  The tiles and woodwork are beautifully restored, the mirrors are antiqued to perfection, most of the light fixtures are charming.  In light of how-well designed everything else seemed to be, the cheap white metal fluorescent fixtures above the bar with label glue still staining them stood out like sore thumbs.  But I digress . . .\n\nWe claimed a primo table by the bar and set out to enjoy the \"best burger in Philly\".  Our waiter was very friendly, helpful with beer selections, and solicitous without being intrusive.  My friend went with the burger as described on the menu; I added cheddar.  We split an order of duck fat fries and washed it all down with beer.  To get right down to business, the burgers (both ordered medium) were good.  They were so good that I did not even mind paying $10 for them.  However, they were NOT the best burgers in Philly.  Both were slightly overcoooked, and the meat, while juicy, would have benefited from a bit more salt or seasoning.  If I had waited 2 hours for the experience, I would have been right pissed.  The duck fat fries were very good - crunchy on the outside, redolent with duck fat flavor, and filled with fluffy potato-y goodness.  Though the order looked on the small side, they were rich enough that the two of us could not finish them.\n\nI expect I will be back to Village Whiskey.  I really dug the vibe, and I saw some intriguing cocktails being prepped with tender-loving-care at the bar.  I was entranced by the shaving of limes and muddling of herbs.  Speaking of cocktails, I ordinarily loves me some whiskey and the list at Village was pretty spectacular.  It makes it all the more sad that I will probably not be having any of them there.  The mark-ups were fairly ridiculous, especially since good whiskey does not really require any Iron Chef magic.",

I really wanted to find a gem here. \nPlaces to sit inside and out along the loop. \nHas a older look to it but clean. \nWe had not heard of this place but we love NYC pizza and we're excited to maybe get to have a taste of it once again. \nThe waitress said it would be cheaper to order by the slice so we did. We got bacon and sausage. \nIt came loaded!!! So much in each slice we could have used it on two more slices. \nSadly this was not NYC pizza. The crust was hard. Too hard to fold it in half. Hardly any cheese. I want crazy about the flavor but my daughter likes it. The pieces were so big we couldn't finish them make the cost quit a deal. \nNot a place I'd visit again but not too bad.",

  "text": "I agree with both the good and bad reviews on here.  I think the trick is in ordering.  There are a few standouts and also a few things that should be left alone but if you stick with the tried and true favorites, you'll do just fine.  That would be oysters on the half shell (especially during 50 cent happy hour) and French 75s.  Perfect way to end a long day!  The pork rillette is also phenomenal, I realize I might as well just spread it directly on my love handles rather than eat it but sometimes you just have to indulge, right?  Make sure you let it sit for a few minutes to come to room temp and that's when it gets really good.\n\nBoudin noir, not so great, cochon sandwich, fine but not worth repeating and the Choucroute Maison kind of made me feel like Fred Flinstone.  I have had really indifferent (bartenders) and even downright rude (hostesses) but mostly I just find the servers there either preoccupied, unknowledgeable or overly busy. But I don't go for service, just those perfectly mixed cocktails and briny, cool oysters!",

Two huge pancakes (took half of them home to enjoy for breakfast the next day.) \n\n And the Benton's Bacon was perfectly cooked. The eggs were over medium, which sounds simple but you would be amazed at the variation I get when I order my eggs. Some people just don't know how to do over medium eggs. \n\nI \"upgraded\" (an additional dollar) to sweet potato pancakes and was very glad I did. I love sweet potatoes but sometimes restaurants over do it when making sweet potato things (the bright orange color is always a dead giveaway that this is the case.)However, to my delight Puckett's sweet potato pancakes came out and were a golden brown color. Had they forgotten the sweet potato? Nope, there was a distinct sweet potato flavor in the pancakes and just a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. Very well done. \n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful. Yesterday's weather was crazy, so I started sitting outside and ended up having to move inside when the rain started getting the pages of my book wet. They accommodated my mid meal move well. \n\nAlso my coffee cup was never less than half way full. Which is a much early mornings. I will def be back for breakfast.

Waxing is always somewhat painful, but it is much less so here since they use the blue wax that is great for more sensitive skin.  The prices are  maybe slightly higher than some places in the immediate area, but this place is so great that it is worth it.  You get fantastic customer service as well. Everyone that I have met who works here is super friendly and look like they want to be there/enjoy what they do.  Lori B. is who I always go to.  I love her!

They specialize in what they do and I like that I know when I get there that each person who works here know what they are doing  and do it very well.\n\nI hope to try some of their other services soon!",

  "text": "Pralines and Peanut Butter!!\n\nReview my photos and you'll see that my wish-list line of sweets include peanut butter, peanut butter, and more peanut butter.  Yes, I love me some peanut butter and it wasn't until now, that I enjoy a good praline once in awhile too.  We stopped at Southern Candymakers not once, but twice, during our weekend stay in New Orleans.  This only means that we wanted more and more is exactly what I got. \n\nWhat to expect...\n-Southern Candymakers has entrances on both sides.  I prefer that you walk through the Decatur Street side. From there, you're immediately in line to the register.  Make up your mind quick because the line goes quick. \n \n-The Selection...all sorts of goodness.  Chocolates galore!  As you get to the register, you'll get to the Pralines.  Some of the best pralines are found here.  \n\n-Pre-Boxed Treats\n\n-Souvenirs\n\nMy Selections:  Peanut Butter dominates my choices.  I'm sure the other chocolates were good, but it's all about the nutty taste of PB for me.  Love their PB Pralines, PB covered Oreo's, and the PB Pretzel.  All PB cups were a little too much for me to handle.\n\n-Peanut Butter Praline:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uTva7BqdYwI3JfN8eY5OsA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Covered Oreo Cookies:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jN748Nb2T6S-mletDtm8wA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Chocolate Pretzel:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ELiAwzEGyDkvWPYxac0JOw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Yinlqhp2O-Hw5OO5VeSjw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-White Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ch3Sm7fF-vBcjzosWb_DDA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Passion Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BFNVDZvRgAGHoi1QHkGj2Q&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nOverall, I'm giving Southern Candymakers 4 Stars for service, selection of sweets, the abundance of peanut butter choices, quality, and taste.  The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 Stars is price.  $2.50 for one peanut butter cup?!?!  \n\n\nPS:  Read Terri R's review.  She's right, you are hit with the sweet smell of sugar.  You can even smell it from outside.  Need to wake up..try walking inside Southern Candymakers. If the smell of freshly made chocolates or peanut butter doesn't wake you up, then you must be made of stone.\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (033/366)",

  "text": "My mom and I ventured to NOLA for a girls weekend (first time for both of us). I found Hotel Mazarin on Trip Advisor's website. The hotel was highly rated with awesome reviews and I decided to book! The hotel does fill up fast and I'd recommend booking sooner than later.\n\nWhen we arrived our room was not ready but we received free drink tickets for the bar and headed up for a glass of wine. Cute bar attached to the restaurant with a nice small outside sitting area.\n\nRoom: We opted for a courtyard room (street views tend to be very noisy especially on the weekend). Lovely room with 2 queen beds and granite bathroom. We could hear noise from the courtyard on Saturday night (there was a wedding) but the other nights were quite peaceful.\n\nAll staff are friendly and helpful. Major props to Janet the concierge. She gave us great dinner ideas (Tableau and GW Fins) and set us up for a plantation half day tour.\n\nThe restaurant is around the corner from Bourbon Street and walking distance to the church and Mississippi river.\n\nI highly recommend this hotel if you are willing to spend a little extra money. The staff, great buffet breakfast with courtyard seating and free wifi make up for the cost in my opinion.",

  "text": "Marrakesh is all about creating an experience, and sadly that experience is one I would prefer to never have again. \n\nI went with my bf, his parents, our close friend and her parents and friends to Marrakesh. She chose the restaurant, having been there before, and chose the 8:30pm seating time for our party of 10. The restaurant is located off of South Street on this almost alley-like street, and the moment you walk in you grasp the concept they're trying to throw out at you: a traditional Moroccan-style meal in a setting that's supposed to mimic Moroccan interiors, with loud Middle Eastern style music (that sounded like the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack). Rugs are everywhere, on the floor and wall, and you sit on low couches or cushion stools around round tables. \n\nThe meal is a 7 course prix fixe $35 per person (no a la carte menu), although they do have vegetarian alternatives to the meat dishes. The only menu they hand you is the drinks menu, which ranges from beer to wine to rose water to Coca cola. The menu is as follows:\n\nFirst course: 3 salads, eggplant, tomato-cucumber, and carrot\nSecond course: phyllo pastry filled with chicken and egg with powdered sugar and cinnamon on top. Vegetarian alternative is without chicken, just egg.\nThird course: Whole chicken, slow-cooked, either mild or spicy (we asked for spicy sauce on the side). Vegetarians get a lentil dish.\nFourth course: Either honey lamb or beef shish kebabs, we asked for both. Vegetarians have a spinach-filled rolled pastry.\nFifth course: Couscous topped with chicken, raisins, and vegetables. No chicken for vegetarians.\nSixth course: Fresh fruit bowl\nSeventh course: mint tea and baklava.\n\nThe meal was awful from the start. They sat us all the way at the top floor, in the back - we're pretty sure they continuously forgot about us throughout the meal. Our waiter looked like he was in high school, and it took him 15 minutes to get our drinks (only 4 people ordered anything); in the mean time, the music was so obnoxiously loud we could barely talk to one another, let alone the people next to us, and the air conditioning was so high that I was shivering - and I was wearing a sweater! - and even after asking them to turn it down, it was STILL cold.\n\nConsidering that its a prix fixe menu, you would expect the food to come out quickly, but we waited about 45 minutes for the first course, which isn't even cooked! Our waiter was not attentive in general, and each course took far too long to come out (he also took forever to realize we were done with each dish). The food overall was not good - edible, but where were the spices? The FLAVOR?! My bf said the lamb was good, but otherwise we were all very disappointed in the dishes. And there was waaaay too much food, we felt bad towards the end because of all the wasted food since we could barely have more than a bite of the later courses. The fruit plate mostly went into people's purses. I was most disappointed by the baklava, which was truly awful just phyllo pastry and honey WHERE WERE THE NUTS?! I'm Greek, I love baklava and this was awful. \n\nPerhaps the worst part of the evening, after suffering through awful service, bad food and too much of it, obnoxious atmosphere (which includes a belly dancer going around to each table), the waiter brings the bill and tells us AT THAT MOMENT that they take cash or check but NOT credit cards. They didn't tell us when we made the reservations, they didn't tell us at the beginning of the meal to allow us to run to a bank and get money, they had the audacity to tell us right at the end. I thought he was joking, but no. We managed to pool enough cash together, but the entire experience was not worth it and I will NEVER go back there. If this restaurant is about creating an experience, all they did was create a bad one.",

  "text": "I am so thrilled that we finally have Korean BBQ in Pinellas County. We had Korean BBQ in Winter Park once before and I was hoping it would make it to our area. 66 Q-Pot lived up to our expectations. \n\nCurrent prices: \nHot Pot $22.99  (Sort of like fondue..you cook your food in broth)\nKorean BBQ $26.99 (You cook your food on a grill that is in the table) \nCombination of both $29.99\n\nWe decided to go all out and do both for our first visit. Honestly, we will probably stick to Korean BBQ in future visits. We liked the meat and the end result much better on the grill than we did the items cooked in broth. \n\nFor the Hot Pot, you pick your broth, meats/seafood and veggies/noodles. You are able to pick more than one broth. We tried the original and spicy. I don't recommend the spicy because while it had a good flavor, it was oily from all the added chili oil. We went with udon noodles, potatoes, beef and pork and mushrooms. The meat comes rolled up and is blanched in the liquid for a quick cook. There is not a lot of flavor to this style of cooking, which is why we liked the bbq better. \n\nFor the Korean BBQ, we had quite a few different items. We liked the black pepper steak, pork belly and the curry chicken probably the best out of everything we tried. However, there wasn't really anything we didn't like on the Korean BBQ side. We also tried corn, mushrooms and onions. None of these came out great on the grill, but you need a little something with your meat. \n\nThey also have a really awesome sauce and seasoning bar (try the special soy sauce..it's great) and a small accompaniment bar that has lettuce for wraps, kimchi, fruit, desserts, etc. I grilled some pineapple which was delicious. We also seasoned and sauced all the meat we cooked which brought it to another level. The only thing I really wished that they had different were some rice at the bar (or a bowl brought out with the meats). It would also be a good idea to have mushrooms and onions on the bar instead of having to order them each round. \n\nOverall, we left really happy and full. This is definitely a fun and interactive eating experience. We loved it and we will return.",

Don't come here for service 'cuz it is slow. In their defense, this place is always packed so I imagine things get backed up.\n\nI was really eyeing their special that night, but once we ordered it, it was already sold out! So I opted for the chicken livers as my entree (even though it's listed under appetizer, that thing is huge) and ordered a side of collard greens and cornbread. My husband started with a cup of gumbo, which was just ok and then had the meatloaf plate, which was not a very big plate, surprisingly. After gulping his down, he started helping me out with mine, and said I had the better dish! Even with him helping me, we didn't finish the whole dish so we took it to go and it was our snack the next day. Being stuffed from dinner didn't prevent us from ordering dessert. We shared a peach cobbler but we weren't too impressed by it.\n\nNext time, I will have to try the fried chicken and bread pudding!!",

  "text": "Oh. my. god. I am madly in love with this place! I had been there for dinner once before and adored it, but I always wanted to return for brunch, since I heard excellent things about Kanella's brunch. My brunch experience this morning solidified Kanella's place in my heart forever. It is probably in my top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Philadelphia, since the dishes here have been consistently fresh and flavorful. The food manages to be rich, complex, and filling yet surprisingly light. \n\nI had family visiting from out of town, and I wanted to take my family to somewhere unique instead of a typical brunch spot with all the predictable items. Kanella's brunch menu is creative, and integrates some lunch and dinner items with more traditional breakfast mainstays like fried eggs. To start, we got freshly pressed coffee and the dips of the day. The dips impressed right off the bat. The baba ganoush and hummus were perfectly garlicky and lemony. Our favorite was a blend of carrots, feta, and some other delicious ingredients I really wish I could remember (facepalm). The grape leaves on the Kanella platter were among the best I've ever had. The rice was well-textured, and the grape leaves avoided being overly oily and mushy, a grape leaf pitfall I've experienced in the past. My dad had the most breakfast-y item out of all of us, which was the stewed tomato and onion shakshouka served with eggs and crispy bread. He enjoyed it greatly and described it as a fresh variation on huevos rancheros. The haloumi here is the best I've ever had. \n\nI was very happy in my decision to take an out-of-towner here, and I will keep it in mind  when I need to impress my next Philly visitor! Oh, and did I mention it's relatively affordable and also a BYOB? Win.",

It is a breed of cattle from the region of Piedmont in north-west Italy.  It was the best steak I've ever put in my mouth.  I was too full for dessert so I got it to go.  The Truffle Indulgence was dark chocolate ganache, peanut butter, and goo goo cluster.  What's not to love?  \n\nThe entire staff is always very friendly and do everything they can to make your dinner very enjoyable.  They are truly glad you are there to dine with them.

It makes me uncomfortable and a little sad to see someone on the stage, belting out Total Eclipse of the Heart with tears in their eyes. \nBut, last night at the Barbary was a different kind of Karaoke. As I walked in the door, there was a man singing I Would Do Anything for Love. Yes, the Meatloaf song. And he was doing quite the job sounding like the one, the only, the man, the myth, the legend. \nThe beers were cheap, at $3 for a High Life, I think I can dig. I can dig on this place real hard.",

The chef has an impressive pedigree and his food speaks for itself.  Everything is made fresh and very tasty!  I particularly like the salvadorian tamale, stuffed with scrumptious roast pork and steamed in a banana leaf, which makes the masa extra tender and tasty.   Other things I have enjoyed here include the pupusas ($1), tacos, and burrito bowls.  And of course, who doesn't love a self-serve salsa bar with all the tasty treats!",

The bartender was pleasant and knowledgeable.  The only thing better would be if he was the opposite sex and gorgeous.  But hey, you can't have everything!\n\nThe place was just starting to fill up.  It was an interesting mix of blue collar, white collar, and the occasional tourist.  There was even a couple sitting at a table with a beautiful Labrador retriever at their feet. \n \nAlthough I was at the bar, I was watching the wait staff work.  They appeared to be friendly and efficient.  Always a good thing.  \n\nMy beers were great.  Yelpers have commented on the fries so I ordered a plate.  I urge you to do the same.  They are really excellent.  The small size was a meal for me.  They have a large.  It scares me to think about it!\n\nI can't wait to come back for more great beer and to try some of the food.",

There must be a theme when ordering breakfast, because yet again, we started with the cinnamon bun. YUMMO. Also, I just love how you get this little appetizer of granola. It was mighty tasty, reminded me of shortbread. I opted for an omelet and it was very filling and fresh. Our server was very kind and helpful when deciding what to order. It's a little tight when needing to use the facilities, as there is only one and you have to wait in a hallway where the workers are also coming around, but you make do. Super cute!",

And of course there are counter seats facing the open kitchen (best view in my eyes). We were famished by the time we got there so we took the first available seating which was at the counter. We saw how the seafood was hand picked (literally) and prepared.  \n\nService was very attentive as our orders was taken right away. Food came out fast and the hotel that we stayed at (Milo Hotel) gave us a complimentary clam chowder order for this place, it was definitely put to good use. The clam chowder came in a cup, not in the bread bowl. It was more than enough as an appetizer and tasted so good. For our entrees, we had the Rock Crab Special and the Calamari Sandwich. Both orders came with a side of cole slaw and union rings. I am a big seafood lover so getting my hands dirty for that delicious crab was so well worth it. The crab was a little smaller than expected but super fresh and delicious. The Calamari Sandwich was also good, the seafood quality here is unbelievable for the price. \n\nI can't wait to come back the next time I'm in SB! Already craving my crab & clam chowder [drools]",

In town for just a few days, it was really important to me to find a minute to see some good friends who have just moved to Nashville. We met here on a Saturday morning at around 10 before my flight. The line was out the door when we arrived. It moved quickly, and we were seated by about 10:25 (3 adults and two kidlets). Once you're in, the food comes quickly, so I was actually thankful for the time spent waiting in line, getting to catch up with my friends before we were elbow deep in pancake goodness.\n\nI had four silver dollar pancakes, two strips of perfectly-made bacon and a scrambled egg. The pancakes were among the best I've ever had, if not the best, and I know from pancakes. There are crayons for kids, as well as some M&M pancakes that were the hit of the party. There aren't so many M&Ms that you run the risk of sugar shock, just enough to add novelty and get picky eaters out of their shell enough to get some calories into little bodies before their Saturday adventures.\n\nA morning with lovely company at a charming place: I won't soon forget my morning at Pancake Pantry.",

  "text": "Do not let the strip mall location fool you, this is a fabulous restaurant. As far as I know, it's the only Peruvian restaurant in the St Louis area.\n\nThe decor is simple but pleasant. Nice furniture, warm neutral color scheme, and some pretty metalwork all make you feel like you are leaving the strip mall scene behind when you walk through the door. (You know how it is, when you go to a cheep little restaurant, and you can just *feel* the supermarket two doors down? Mango thankfully manages to block the supermarket aura)\n\nThe meal starts out with fried plantain chips instead of bread. They get 5 stars for this alone. I am deeply in love with all fried banana-type foodstuffs.\n\nOur table ordered about half a dozen appetizers, and all I remember is a delicious blur of hot and cold, sweet and spicy, and lots of bright colors. I do remember for sure that the ceviche was excellent. If you've got a group of people, order a bunch to share.\n\nFor dinner, I had the seafood special, which was mahi mahi that night (I think). It was served with delicious mashed potatoes (did you  know that Peru has some enormously huge number of native potato species?) and a delicious chunky mango-based sauce. Though I did have tastes of a number of the other entrees, and they were also wonderful. All very different.\n\nVegetarians take note: They do have vegetarian options. A couple of them even look like they could be ordered without cheese to make them vegan.\n\nFor desert, I had the flan. It was great, soft texture, and the sauce was thin like it ought to be (not just regular caramel sauce poured over pudding) Others at my table had the Torta de Chocolat, which was excellent.\n\nOverall, I loved how the food had a very playful combination of sweet, starchy and spicy. One of the people at dinner with us had gone to high school in Peru, and according to her, the flavors were very authentic. She was also very excited to see they had Inca Cola. We had a really wonderful dinner experience, and will definitely be back.",

The place was busy and it looked as if a reservation was necessary.  However, with little effort we were seated and enjoyed a wonderful lunch.\n\nThe experience at Café Ponte addresses both the taste and the visual.  The dining room is lovely to look at with tables and booths adorned with white table clothes and fine flatware.  Some of the booths have an artistic and participatory feel about them as they are half booths facing the dining room allowing you to look out toward the activity.  There is a beautiful wine cellar that accents tables as the open up into a service/kitchen area that you hardly notice because of the curved lines allowing it to blend in with the interior.  A very beautiful place.\n\nI enjoyed a special for lunch; a beet salad which was as impressive as the interior.  Every component of the salad tasted fresh.  It was huge mounding portion of mixed greens with halves and quarters of yellow and red beets.  There was no need for an additional salad dressing because the way it was prepared was excellent.  Most salads are boring and something I find myself getting solely for dietary reasons.  This salad blended flavors and textures that satisfied and delighted; from the cool leaves of the greens to the crunch of the beets this was a salad that you could not stop eating.  Even what appeared to be croutons was a delightful surprise as it was actually spice bread th complimented the salad so completely that it was genius.  I really enjoyed this salad.\n\nIf you are looking for a night out or a special lunch I would recommend this place.  After my visit I would definitely encourage reservations because you would not want to miss out.  I hope to return soon to try other items.",

We ordered a side of bacon as well. \n\nOnce the food came out, I dug in and enjoyed every bit of it. The touch of honey on the grilled cheese really brought the flavor together. I loved having the egg on top as well. The bacon - wow. We couldn't even finish all the bacon but I loved it. We both enjoyed our meals. The items on the menu may seem strange to a first timer, but trust that you will be satisfied with anything, so give it a shot. I would love to come back to try more. \n\nI gave it 4 out of 5 only because I need to try more before giving it the title of \"best brunch in Indy\", but I was definitely impressed with what I had!",

  "text": "As much as I love Indian food, this place was kind of a disappointment.\n\nI came here during lunch with my intern friend and we both wanted to try this Indian \"chipotle\" concept. I ordered the rice bowl + chicken, along with some toppings. \n\nThe chicken was dry and bland, and the toppings were not fresh. The owner recommended that I get the crispy chickpea topping. BUT it was not crispy at all, except 2 bites. So, my guess is that those \"crispy\" toppings were not fresh. The spinach sauce topping was good though, as the owner recommended. I've had better Indian food, and this really does not cut it. Though if you're looking for a quick lunch with protein and veggies, this is worth a try!",

We were fortunate that after the hostess told us that the wait for a table was close to two hours a couple of seats opened up at the bar.\n \nWe started off with a couple of amazing cocktails that were expertly prepared (2nd only to Hop Sing), an order of deviled eggs, and the duck fat fried fries covered in a delectable cheese sauce and topped with beef brisket....WOW! We were content but decided to push on and try their famous burgers. I had the special of the house that had a terrific homemade thousand island dressing and my wife had hers topped with foie gras and bacon. Both came out cooked perfectly medium rare surrounded by a very fresh and delicious bun. Even though we were fairly full before the burgers came we ate every bite leaving in a blissful state of food intoxication.",

Go for one of the top picks- I'm so glad they have that labelled really well now it makes it super easy to experience with new friends. \nBut some of my favourite go to choices: sunflower and dream. A couple weird choices you might not think of getting but are SO good: sesame, red bean, and taro (if love purple and sweet totally get a taro). \nSago and jelly? Don't worry if you don't like these gummy things that make you feel like your chewing your drink just ask them not to put it in. Personally I'm a fan and used to ask for double the amount of both- I've hence lowered that addiction so my bubble tea looks more normal now. \n\nDream Tea house off whyte Ave is one of the best locations- with a new Reno this place is beautiful and they have board games you can sign out to play(just make sure you bring ID). \nParking is good for a couple hours but be cautious they watch the time limits really closely here. \n\nOn a side note this place is busy! Expect a bit of a line but they can seriously pump out the bubble tea's fast! And don't forget t get yourself a stamp card- for every 9 drinks get the 10th one free!",

My favorites are usually the shrimp cocktail and the filet sliders. The shrimp were definitely not fresh and had a bad taste. I've sent them back twice now.  I asked for medium filets and received them very well done on 3 separate occasions. I had to also send back the gritty asparagus. It was filled with sand.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the food gets back to where it was. It won't be my last time dinning at Harry and Izzys, but I will ask about the freshness of the food before ordering in the future. Wine selection is always great.",

I'd like to think it adds a little spice to everyone's 8 to 5, handshaking desk jobs.  \n\nI try to stay away from the lure of Fast Burrito as much as possible because I always end up gorging myself in a gutbusting pile of rice, beans and pork magic before it's all said and done. Or, on the flip side, I'll go there from time to time to make a measly order of \"a side of rice and a side of mixed beans (pinto/black)\". This is my guilt-free approach to Mexican food. What I love about the folks at Fast Burrito is that they never get pissy about my silly 5 bite orders. They charge me, what I believe to be an underpriced $2 for the 2 sides. This $2 is followed by a generous tip because I feel guilty walking away with such a steal - granted it's just rice and beans. \n\nPiece of advice - when the day comes for you to pay a visit to Fast Burrito,  I recommend throwing a little Spanish back at 'em - totally worth the surprised smile on their faces:)",

  "text": "I would probably give this place 5 stars if I had much experience with other places but this was my first time ever getting a colonic.  Also, my boyfriends experience was just a bit different than mine (we went together, at the same time, in two different rooms).\n\nMy room was awesome...it had the bed and the 'cleaning station' (with wipes and whatnot for you to use afterwards) and next to the bed was a mirror that was angled upwards so you can see what was coming out of you!  Of course it sounds weird but I loved it! I enjoyed watching my body get rid of all that stuff- it was reassuring that I was actually DOING something for my body.  I was also given this awesome heat pack for my stomach for when I had minor cramping (best heat pack ever...I want to know where they get those things! It keeps the heat for EVER!)  I was checked in on by two different ladies (Cheryl and her assistant Ruth- I believe those names are correct but I could be wrong, im horrible with names).  Both were friendly and accommodating.  \n\nDownsides: my boyfriend tells me afterwards that he did NOT have the viewing ability.  There was no mirror and no tube where he can see what was being flushed out.  Is this right?  I told him maybe he missed it and didn't notice it but I feel that he would have noticed something like that.  Maybe only one room was equipped with this.  That was a huge bummer because I feel like that was a huge part of the experience! He also didn't get the heat pack for some reason and I think he could have used it because he had slight cramping as well.  \n\nI wish that Cheryl could have maybe spoken to us (or rather just me because I had the viewing tube) about what I was seeing.   I thought that maybe after she would but that never happened.  Next time maybe I will ask but I know that each color and consistency is very important and means different things.  I was hoping that I could leave that place with the recommendation of eating more of one thing or less of another or something based off of my excrement (eww gross I know, but its true!)\n\nPrice is ok, wish it was less so that we could do it more often.  Definitely want to go back for a second time around to really get more stuff out- we just need to wait for the paycheck, its about $55 per person plus tip for a basic hydrotherapy colonic session (smallest package)",

  "text": "I'm a little puzzled by all the rave reviews for this place. Don't get me wrong, I still continue to go here despite the \"meh\" food, but the attractiveness of Mumbai Bistro lies nearly entirely in the location and the price (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).\n\nI am definitely glad that there is place in walking distance from both Jefferson and Pennsylvania hospital that serves ready-made Indian food I can grab on my lunch break. The standard hospital cafeteria fare can grow old quickly, and I often fantasize about a delicious curry when I contemplate grabbing something predictable from the hospital cafe. \n\nAnd I suppose it's a smart business strategy to serve Indian food that is palatable to pickier eaters or people who don't normally enjoy spicy cuisine, but for someone like me who loves Indian food for its vibrant and complex flavors, the food served here is a bland facsimile of familiar favorites. The malai kofta and the mixed vegetable curry are probably the best meatless dishes served here, but even those lack the expected richness and texture. The Gobi Malasa tends to be overcooked and mushy and the paneer masala is downright watery. The naan is somewhat soggy and seems like it has been microwaved.\n\nI don't like giving bad reviews, and I want this place to remain in business, but I think there are some very easy fixes they could do to improve the food here, namely not watering down dishes and not using a microwave to heat up naan. I think it is great that they do not use butter or ghee, but I've also made vegan Indian food in my own home that was more flavorful than this, so I don't find the health claims to be a valid excuse for blandness. I think the concept of a cheap vegan & celiac-friendly buffet that is 5$ a pound is a fantastic idea, but I don't think that it should come at the cost of flavor and consistency.\n\nIf you work close by and you're really craving some cheap and fast Indian food that meets your dietary restrictions, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to come here, but if you have your choice of Indian restaurants, I'd definitely recommend choosing a different one.",

They service has way more personality than your usual lunch waiter or waitress, but they also are very buttoned up.  Its a pleasure\n\n2) The beverages- so many waters to choose from!  I've never actually had one, but the range is impressive.  What I HAVE had is the Arnold Palmer which is delicious.  A little sweet, a little wake-me-up- delish\n\n3) The views.  WOW.  The place could serve dysentery and I'd still come as often as I could.  Boathouse Row, Kelly Drive, 76, The Zoo Balloon, 30th Street Station, The Art Museum- just a lovely panorama view of the city, and the river actually looks pretty!\n\n4) The food- while it COULD be awful, it isn't!  It's so so good!  They serve you fresh rolls at the beginning of your meal, and the appetizers are so delicious.  We split a flat-bread, and the octopus.  For my entree I got the grilled vegetable sandwich and fresh fries.  The fries are twice fried so they have that lovely crisp, and they're perfectly salted.  The sandwich is cheesy and warm and not soggy and so fresh and delicious.  I just can't say enough good things.\n\nI don't lunch often, but when I do, I lunch at Water Works.",

  "text": "Before I hear from all you lovers of the tavern let me say that maybe I didn't love it here because it was an extremely busy holiday weekend, or maybe it was because I had a tick bury itself into my foot! \n\nLet me say, I'm not a camping or woodsy guy. I would much prefer a nice hotel with a five star dinner than being at a tavern in the middle of no where. With that, I do enjoy new things. \n\nNew things here they come...we arrived around 11:30AM at the tavern on a holiday weekend and most of the shaded spots had been taken up. It was hot and I was ready for a beer. With beer in hand we decided we needed to try one of their famous tri-tip. \nTip: You need to purchase the ticket at the bar to pick up the sandwich outside. \nSo on to get the sandwich. While chatting with some friends in line I was interrupted by a stranger with a \"hey, you got a tick on your foot.\" Not really knowing what to do, I played it cool and squeezed it out of my foot. After a bit of blood, I followed with a polite \"thank you.\" I then went on with my chatting and drinking, all the while thinking....I had a tick in my foot...can't you get some sort of disease from that?...I'm glad he knew it was a tick because I had no idea....I really should know stuff like this...why didn't it hurt?...I've only had a sip of my beer so I still should feel it, right?...and why the hell am I here anyway? \n\nThe debate and questions in my head raged on. I finally approached the tri-tip bbq area where I was greeted with a wall of smoke that had now blinded me, albeit a nice distraction from my tick situation. I got my sandwich which was basically meat and bread. They had some bbq sauce and a couple other condiments on the side, but without a plate and beer in hand it was hard to manage. \n\nWe finally found a spot to sit and eat. The sandwich was good, not great. The band started playing some music and the day got a bit better. \n\nI probably won't return, but I have now educated myself on ticks and if I encounter one in a plush hotel in the future I will know just what to do.",

The food is still good but the service here, maybe because of all the people, isn't as good as the Western spot.  I literally watched nachos we'd ordered sit in the window for 10 minutes from my seat at the bar.  Really??  The space is just small and crowded and damn near claustrophobic.  Ok, so the Charlotte one is newer, yes, so its bigger and shinier but considering you get the same food (confession: I do love their burgers) and drinks at each location I'd rather go to the larger one with better service.  You're better off sitting at the bar at this location if you want faster service.  They do serve food all night so its a great place to grab grub after a long night out.

  "text": "We stumbled upon Wheel Cafe last weekend in search of some breakfast. After looking at the Yelp photos of delicious pancakes and omelets from Wheel we decided to give it a shot, the banner on Yelp claimed that Wheel Cafe serves brunch \"Saturday & Sunday, 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.\" We arrived around 1pm on Saturday and were disappointed to find that they were only serving lunch and it would seem they only have brunch on Sunday during those times. \n\nThe 20% off coupon was incentive to forgo our pancake cravings and try something from the lunch menu instead. I found the menu to be a little limited, some items were scratched off leaving really only some sandwich or salad choices and a few burgers. My husband and I both got the Wheel burger ($9.99) which comes with bacon, a sweet onion ring, beer cheese, and arugula on a homemade bun served with house made potato chips. I found the bun to be a bit tough and my burger was a little tough and dry too. The burger is a 6oz. house made brisket and chuck patty. My husband absolutely loved his, he thought it was perfect and cooked to perfection hence the 4 stars. I am going to chalk this one up to mine just having been a little overcooked. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience, the staff were friendly. The sweet tea was a little un-sweet for me but the house made chips were good and I ordered a side of ranch that I think may be homemade and it was really good for chip/burger dipping. We will definitely visit again and check out the breakfast soon, those Elvis cakes look real good.",

I blew in here for lunch after an aborted jury duty experience.  \n\nMy first impression was IMMACULATE.  This place was spotless!  In the men's bathroom I swear you could eat off the floor.  I didn't check the ladies room as I didn't want to deal with the yelling and screaming that would ensue.  A place this clean is a good thing. \n\nThe ATMOSPHERE here is pure classic pub.  Lots of beautifully finished dark wood and slightly dim lighting.  The bar is very nice with about 15 seats and a few high-tops near it.  I loved it.\n\nI ordered Beef Barley soup ($6) and a Roast Beef sandwich ($6.50). I added sharp provolone for $.75.  My soup was hearty and delicious and served at the correct temperature so I could enjoy it right away.  I hate it when the soup is so hot you just have to stare at it and wait for it to cool.\n\nIf you are a roast beef sandwich aficionado there are two things that might surprise you here.  First, this sandwich is served with rich brown gravy not au jus.  Second, if you pay your $.75 for sharp provolone, and you should, it's served on the side.  I don't know if you can tell from my pic but that was a lot of cheese.  Way more than you would normally get on a sandwich.   BTW- This was one delicious sandwich!\n\nThese folks are coming up on their one year anniversary.  I hope they stick around.  I'll help out by coming back for sure.",

  "text": "THE LAYOUT:\nIt's a pretty small, cozy spot, nestled on ever-bustling South St.  Kind of conspicuous, but let's hope it can establish itself in a neighborhood known for its diverse offering of venues.  Surprisingly enough, however, the main floor is VERY conducive to groups, it's wide and inviting...in fact I met some new friends before I could even get a brew in hand!  The decor and mood are modern, trendy, sophisticated without being snobbish.\n\nTHE FOOD/DRINKS:\nI doubt the drinks we had were typical of Sonam's offering, but DAMN were they good-- I had the pale ale (I wish I would have explored these microbrews more) and then got into the vodka drinks, the green melon/lime mojitotini or whatever it was was delicious...delicious enough for Dave and myself to drink them as shots.  Surprisingly enough, I didn't get toooo drunk.  \n\nThe food was good too for the most part...the skewers and empanadas were good, but what the hell was going on with soup in a pear??  Keep the soup, just give me the pear...I know it's very cool nowadays to mix flavors and foods in unconventional new ways, but soup in a pear is not a good exercise in gourmet food.  Desert was lovely as well.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nThrow a party here, it is a great place to hang lose with a group.  I can't speak for Sonam on a normal night, but my interest has been piqued enough to want to check it out again sometime soon.",

  "text": "I love Brixx. I have probably been about 8 times this year. It's got something for everyone. Good beer and wine plus their pizzas you can split half and half so if you can't make up your mind between two kinds or want to split; you can. They do not charge extra for that. \n\nI LOVE the buffalo chicken pizza with blue cheese and the mushroom with arugula. They are my two favorite but I have never heard anyone complain about their exotic combinations or variety of choices. \n\nThey have an outside patio that allows dogs which is open in the summer. \n\nThe only sad part of this restaurant is the lack of professionalism or maturity in some of the employees. During one visit I was waiting at the bar and the pizza oven sits behind so you have a direct view. This one girl dropped a pizza on the floor scooped it up and put it in the box and was debating if it was still presentable. I don't think she had any afterthought of how insanitary it is to serve food that falls on the floor. It was for a to go and when I noticed that others around her didn't make a comment or mention how they should make new, especially when she went to close the box an employee that saw it looked at me and I said \"you cannot let her serve that.\" He got embarrassed and kind of pretended not to hear me so I said it again. Finally an employee in management looked at me and I explained what happened and said you cannot serve that. So he got rid of it and made them make a new one. That left a bad taste in my mouth but luckily that won't ever happen again. I still love the food and hey the oven is visible so I can keep watching. \n\nAnd an additional note, since that visit I was sitting at the bar to pick up a to go order and they made our pizza wrong so they made another to fix it but instead of throwing it away they asked if I wanted the mess up on the house so we got a free pizza from their mistake which I thought was nice of them. No need to waste food!",

You can watch them make it, which is always cool. They always have a good variety of flavors - I've had the matcha strawberry and the Bangkok Summer ( Thai tea and lychee), and you get a free sauce and three toppings. (I love the mochi, pocky, and condensed milk). If you haven't had rolled ice cream before, the texture is a lot more dense and solid than normal ice cream. It's definitely a shareable portion.  Overall tasty, cold ice cream , and it's a cute place to take friends for novelty dessert. Just wish there was more seating and it gets a little crowded during busy nights.",

It'll be great!\n\nOk well for those of you who stayed...here's my back story.  We were in the GSR for a Pentatonix concert.  We had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the GSR is really bad.  So this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line.  Luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into Johnny Rockets.\n\nWe asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker.  We ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter, a classic burger for my wife and I ordered up the Houston. I upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra.  The burgers coming out looked really good, mine wasn't as good looking and was just fine tasting.  Nothing to write home about or get excited about, just a standard fare sort of burger.\n\nMy daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries.  She enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu.   Our waitress Daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly.\n\nSo if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling, this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price.  The prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint, maybe even a little lower.\n\nParking isn't really that close because it's inside the mall downstairs at the GSR, but it is 1000000 times better than it's old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long.  \n\nWondering how busy they will be when summer comes and \"The Beach\" is open.  We will see.",

  "text": "Luke is a John Besh restaurant. It is known for their 75 cents oysters at Happy Hour, from 3PM-6PM every day. If you like oysters, this place is definitely for you. However, I tried Luke for breakfast. I ordered the chicken and biscuits. It was awesome. The challenge with fried chicken is that it is easy to dry out the meat. The best fried chicken is tender and juicy in the inside while maintaining the crispy skin on the outside. In this regard, Luke is on par with all the best fried chicken I have eaten. I have also been advised to use honey on fried chicken in the past. Until Luke, I refrained from doing so. However, Luke does not leave it up to you and it puts the honey on the chicken for you. I am glad it did because it was great. I also loved the biscuit. Like the chicken, it was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside. The portion size is not huge. I was full but not stuffed. The dish also comes with grits. It is good but I am not a grits fan.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

Although they aren't the happiest, they are helpful if you have questions. \n\nGetting in line for your train can be a little hectic if you are confused about the train system, but once you get used to it, you'll realize this place is a gem to be at and take in!",

There are few dilemmas as great, and as meaningful.\n\nI guess it goes without saying that pizza tastes much better when eating it right from the kitchen; delivery is foodie insult we inflict when we are lazy and hungry. Parkallen pizza is still very good when delivered, but in-house it was sublime! It has the most tasty crust I've long tasted in a pizza. The contributions of each ingredient (we shared a half Hawaiian and half meat-lover) could be noticed and appreciated.\n\nThe hunnybunny's place is near-by, enough so that we've eaten in and picked up pie for transport home. More than once it's been an open question whether we can survive the seductive pizza smell filling the car or should we just pull over and dig in. You've been warned :-)",

  "text": "I'm really impressed with Bridgestone Arena and I like it a lot more than the YUM! Center that's here in Louisville. It's a huge venue with tons of options for beer, liquor, food and vendor souvenir shops. I came here to see the one and only Stevie Nicks, we didn't have floor seats because they were too expensive, but the seats we did have were close enough that we could see, get good pics and good video as well. \n\nThe sound inside of the arena was loud and the acoustics were amazing. It was the escape from real life that I craved and not only did I lose my cherry to seeing one of my idols that night, but also my voice screaming (just ask Scott XD). \n\nThe food smelled great, but we knew better than to get food at an arena because of the up sell on it, instead we had a few drinks. Honestly the beer prices weren't bad, I spent too much money, but for a 16oz craft beer from draft it was $11 and for a 25oz domestic canned beer it was also $11. All the bartenders were very knowledgeable about the products and spirits. Scott didn't think that his cocktails were worth it because we like ours strong, though. At $20 for a double is about the average for any sort of concert venue. The whole staff was extremely friendly and helpful in whatever questions we had when getting drinks, walking around or getting back to our seats. \n\nOne of the major pluses to Bridgestone Arena is that they have a section for smokers & people who just want some fresh air to go outside and be able to re-enter at. This was excellent because between The Pretenders and Stevie Nicks there was about a 20 minute intermission that would have just been boring to sit through, so we were able to get a drink each and enjoy a cancer stick outside. \n\nOverall I would LOVE to see another one of my idols at Bridgestone Arena again, and soon because we weren't able to explore Nashville too much due to the next day being election day (gotta do my civic duty!), but I'm all. The. Way. Down. I'm blown away (tire pun intended) by this arena and you will be too!",

  "text": "So I have been a member here for a few months now...I originally started out with a Groupon for 2 weeks and eventually signed up.  This is an insane workout.  You do 15 minutes of \"warm up\" which I put in quotes only because for most people this \"Warm Up\" will put them on the floor sucking wind.  After that, you are given 1 minute to put your gloves on and begin a 3 minutes, 8 round session where you follow the instructors command on hits.  This portion, you honestly get what you put into it.  I've seen people just tap the bag and some stand there and not really go after it....I understand the \"warm up\" was tough, but come on...hit the thing! :)\n\nAfter the 8 rounds, you grab a medicine ball and begin Core Strength workout for the remaining 10 minutes of the class.\n\nAll in all, you are there for 60 minutes and tend to burn 600-1000 calories (depending on output and fitness level)\n\nIt is a great way to get in shape and I do love the workout.  1 Star off for the price.  It is roughly $70/mo if you sign up for a year but then they want to try and get you to pay 25$ for 30 minute private training sessions.  I don't like that...but hey, they have a business to run I guess.\n\nI highly recommend you try a free class...maybe I'll see you there!",

My wife's fried chicken was excellent. All the sides were great, especially fried okra, mashed potatoes and the sweet potato casserole. The turnip greens were very good once I added a splash of vinegar.\n\nAnd those bread rolls! Scrumptious. They're as big as your fist.

When the waitress heard my plan, she quickly offered to bring me a container of Barbara's homemade BBQ sauce to take with and let me say that it was among the more complex, tangy and lip-licking good sauces in town.\n\nThe portion sizes aren't as huge here as some other meat-and-threes around town, but that's all for the good because it leaves room for the wonderful desserts like caramel pie.\n\nSweet tea was just as good as you'd expect at a place like this.\n\nWe ate on the front porch.

  "text": "Had to meet a friend on the east side and needed to eat. We chose Phan's after reading Yelp reviews. Thank you, trusty Yelpers! Phan greeted us while we were checking out the menu. She invited us to sit down and she would bring us drinks. That was unexpected for a restaurant inside the mall. She brought our drinks out and took our orders. She apologized that it might take some time because she let her help go and she makes everything fresh. We weren't in a hurry and I was happy to wait for fresh food! We started with the fresh spring rolls. Every bite was exactly as I had hoped! The peanut sauce topped them off nicely, too. I had the Pad Ke Mao (hope I spelled that right). Big flat noodles with bok choy and sauce. Yum! My husband ordered the ginger beef. She asked \"how hot 1-5.\" She was surprised when he said 4, but she seemed to be happy with his choice. He was also happy with his choice even though his face was completely red. Our friend had the house fried rice. He made sure to finish every single satisfying bite. She refilled our drinks a couple more times and told us to let her know when we were ready to pay, but no rush. She told us on the way out that this was her first restaurant and she hoped we all loved it. We definitely did. All my east side friends, get in there and EAT! Sorry that there are no photos. We were too busy devouring every last morsel!",

He really knew the dishes and gave accurate descriptions and recommendations based on what we mentioned liking.  \n\nI also loved the ambiance here.

In the mean time you can look around the gallery.\n\nHad the falafel and friend had the burger.   The falafel was pretty good.  The falafel was nice and crispy but the portion size was tiny and was served on a wrap rather than a pita bread.  Felt it was expensive considering the tiny size.  I was still feeling hungry after my meal.  Friend's burger was decent and the fries were nice and crispy but again small portion size on the fries.  \n\nI did enjoy the lovely outdoor seating area.  Thought the tables could be wiped down a little more often.  Despite the slightly higher price and the small portion size I'm still giving it 4 stars because of the ambiance.  And elevated price is expected.",

  "text": "Ya know, I love Don Pablos. I don't live in the area anymore & there isn't a Don Pablos remotely close to the area I live now, so I don't frequent often. Maybe once a year, instead, when I once lived near the Deptford location, I visited twice every other week at least. My sister & I joke, now, about the sodium bloat we get the following day from eating here, no matter how much water we drink w/our meal. Ha. Lotsa salt in their food, so beware. But daaaymn, it is yummmmmmmy!\n\nThere were 6 of us, so when we arrived at 645pm, we had a 15 minute wait while they cleaned up a party that just finished. No biggie. This place is always hoppin' it seems. Kid friendly, loud, very loud. Loud because of the high ceilings, warehouse style. You'd think after 15 years, they would attach some sound protection drop ceilings, but they never have. The place is starting to look a bit worn down, but still clean & cute decor.\n\nSome things never change....and that is a good thing. The Queso Blanco is like crack. Dipping your tortilla chips in that cheese sauce is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! They added a spicy one, w/chilies, so we ordered both. Good thing we did. I ordered the pick 2 combo, a beef enchilada & a cheese & onion enchilada, extra corn cake. That corn cake is also like crack too. I eat everyones. Omg. I think they use cream corn, that has got to be  the secret, but geez it is yummmmm!! I am a sucker for the Sangria - Margarita swirl. Sometimes the bartender does a crappy job of swirling it, & the ratio of sangria to margarita is waaaaaay off balance. That happened while we were there at this visit, but our server, Steven was very accommodating & fixed it. He was (is) a serious rockstar. Our service was on fleek. We keep raving at the service we received at our last visit because it was so good. Steven *I am pretty sure that is his name* was one of the best servers we ever had. He thought ahead, brought us refills w/out us having to ask; he was super efficent & didn't annoy us, coming over to our table & moving us along w/out feeling forced or pushy & was patient while we waited for my nephew & other sister arrive. Amazing server. Best server we had at Don Pablos. 5 stars for Steve. \n\nIt was about to be my nephew's 8th birthday, so we surprised him w/a song & dessert. He was adamant that we not sing & embarass him, butttt, that is what Auntie's do, embarass & laugh. Boy, he was so surprised, embarassed & found it all really funny. Thank you for making that work Steve. \n\nConsistent food & service are why we return. I will definitely visit again when I am in the area.",

Woohoo!!! Margaritas and beer!!!\n\nThe menu is affordable and the tacos are not \"build your own\" but instead creations by the chef. This forces you to try something new. The queso and the guacamole are homemade and fresh. Yes, QUESO! I love queso. My number one gripe with the place that starts with a \"c\" and ends in a \"polte\" is that they don't serve queso and never will (my step brother in law works for their corporate office...they will never have queso). But Taqueria del Sol = delicious cheesy goodness. \n\nAnother good point is that the tacos are sold individually, forcing you to try different combinations. The owner is incredibly friendly and goes out of your way to make you feel at home. \n\n5 stars! Yes, its just a taqueria...but I loved it!",

The bartender Kelley was attentive and friendly despite the fact that it was a very busy night. The beer list is great. Favorites for the night include the Yards IPA on cask and McKenzies black cherry cider. They also had kronenbourg on special. I found the blanc to be pretty tasty.\n\nWe've done the Bastille Day/French trivia in the past and its just a really fun time.

Inside was still nice and atmosphere was good. Service was great even though it was busy.  We got the chips and salsa & salsa Verde.  It was pretty good and at a dollar per person for unlimited, that was great! We opted to also get the guac which was so good.  For dinner I got Mexican food.  The fried calamari tacos were very delicious! My hubby took a bite and agreed. He chose from the BBQ section and got the BBQ mixer where you select the 3 meats you want. Everything was great but we loved the brisket..moist & tender! The sides he got were also good.. potato salad was unique, but despite his big appetite, with his main dish which came with Texas toast, he ate only half of the sides.  The drinks were also very good! Great drink menu and tequila flights available. Would definitely come again and even try their brunch!",

Everything seem fresh and tasty in that way that actual food tastes unlike the Sysco sourced food we eat about everywhere else. \nHandsome and warm dining room. Equally warm (and, sure, handsome) staff. \nWonderful dinner - if this was in my neighborhood it would be our go-to.  Also, don't go here during that week where you want to give up bread as their Parker House rolls are spectacular. \n\nTwo minor things.  \nThe beet steak (which everyone recommended) was odd in that the skin of the beet was still on there and proved to make things a bit more messy. Meh. \nThings moved a bit slow. That's not an issue, really. You're here for a nice evening already. We sat without wine or bread for way too long and our first course took excessively long to arrive. Maybe it was because I was starving that I noticed that.  \n\nAll said, great dinner!",

Not sure if the layout was experimental but much wasted space with isle layout forcing you to waste time crossing the store.Worth the effort once your familiar with layout and isle since they carry more items than most Marsh stores on the Westside.

And if you are someone who loves over-the-top fries, even loading them up with cheese and meat, Village Whiskey is your place. If you are like me, and just want a simple cheeseburger with salted fries, Village Whiskey is NOT your place. \n\nNow, what I do really like about Village Whiskey is their pickles. They are the perfect combo of sharp, salty, and sweet. The pickles come with thick slices of bread, the most luxurious butter-like dairy product (It seems too good to be butter, yet it's obviously not margarine and is probably just really good butter), and tapenade. I especially love their beet pickles.\n\nI have also gone to Village Whiskey a few times for cocktails. While I believe they are typically full on weekend evenings, I have never had a problem finding a seat on a weeknight or after dining hours on a weekend. The cocktails are well-crafted.\n\nSo to sum it up, over-the-top burgers and fries (good or bad depending on your preference), fantastic pickles, and solid cocktails!",

Ordered the aborada: which is fried dough stuffed with plantains, cheese, guava paste and some other ingredients. So delicious, the sweet plantains and guava and melty cheese - how have I not heard of these before? The papas rellenas are more of a small plate than an appetizer - cheese, rice, beans, seasoned with spices, a totally different dish than American stuffed potatoes. The fuzzy navel is tropical and strong, like most of their drinks I've tried, has a taste of tangerine juice. The dominicana chicken comes with the tender marinated chicken in a side dish and the rice and beans mix in the main plate. The owner is so amazing - I had a party of 7 for brunch, and we called a day or 2 before, and he opened 30 minutes early for us so my out of town friend could experience the awesomeness before she had to hit the road.

You can get on and off this jungle gym either via the ramp or stairs. \n\nFor older kids (5 to 12), there is an even larger jungle gym with a really tall slide, monkey bars, a bumpy bridge and more. \n\nThere's a Little Free Library here, but when we peeked inside, it was pretty sparse. \n\nWhat else? There's a huge restroom here, as well as shaded picnic benches, tennis court and walking trail. There is also a rain garden with local plants and flowers, which is beautiful to see.",

  "text": "An cajun restaurant with local flavors, warm decor, and friendly service by the Harrah's Hotel (on the edge of the French Quarter). We were here for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by their reasonable pricing and fresh ingredients. The oysters were great, as were the beignets. I didn't try the gamba but my friend loved it. \n\nI tried the crawfish, which was good but too salty. Everything was way too salty in my plate including the corn. Salt was allowed (sadly) to take over everything. The amount of salt attacked my palettes rather than enliven them. \n\nThe whole dish was spicy which was fine. It was the saltiness that's a problem. \n\nService was efficient and very friendly, which is a redeeming point. A beautiful restaurant with just the right noise level.",

She also teaches a Saturday class that is more of vinyasa flow. The instructor was humorous. Class is meant more for a beginner-intermediate, but it's what you make of it.",

It was a different menu because of restaurant week, but my entree of salmon over quinoa and veggies was one of hte best I've ever had!! I was so full but I had to finish it. They were also running a special for restaurant week where bottles of wine were $35, which i pretty decent for a more upscale place. The staff was very friendly, only issue was we could not find hte hostess for awhile to get seated. But I think she had ran in the back, and they apologized. Overall great inventive take on traditional cuisine. Loved it and cant wait to go back.",

  "text": "I'm a big Top Chef fan so I'm always a fan of checking out their restaurants.  This place did not disappoint.  The restaurant is very small, so make sure you have reservations. Luckily, we did, and were seated right away.  The dishes are all small portion so they recommend ordering 3-4 plates per person. My friend and I wanted to try a little of everything so that worked very well.  We ordered the Ricotta Cheese & Hummus to start.  I loved the hummus. I'm not usually a huge fan of hummus, but this one was really tasty to me.  It comes with big thick slices of fresh bread.  I wasn't a big fan of the Ricotta cheese b/c it had a smokey/bacon type taste to it. I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be in there or not, but I couldn't get past it.  Yes, I'm the only one in the world that doesn't like bacon and Yes, I realize I was dining at a restaurant named \"Fat Ham.\" \n\nOf course had to try the Hot Chicken.  It was HOT. Like really HOT.  Don't order this if you can't do spicy foods. I generally like spicy, but this was slightly past my range.  Luckily they give you a slice of bread and ranch dressing to help cool your mouth.  We also liked the Ham & Eggs. Obviously, i skipped the ham portion, but it was very tasty! I love runny eggs on my food. Everything was very flavorful.\n\nOverall, the experience was very nice. Our service was good and it was overall something new to try!",

We also ordered a cheese and cracker plate to have with our wine.  Gruyere cheese with prosciutto and honey, it was super tasty and went perfect with our drinks.  If you want to take some home you buy a bottle and pay each time to get it refilled.  My favorite was the strawberry and rhubarb.  The semi dry one was good too!  They also sold homemade soaps and honey.  Just wish this place was a little bit bigger for busier days.  Not a lot of seating, but plenty of room around the bar area.",

  "text": "Last weekend I had an incredible weekend in New Orleans with my family. The amenities are great, but even with the Expedia package deal on flight/hotel, I gasped at the price for the room we had. After considering the hotel's location in the French Quarter, it makes a lot of sense though, and turned to be worth it. It's walking distance from The Court of Two Sisters, Cafe du Monde, and many local shops I enjoyed browsing, including a wonderful knitting shop called the Quarter Stitch. Harrah's is a couple of blocks away and if you're not up for walking, there is a cab stand on the corner.\n\nSince this hotel encompasses an entire city block, it is home to a gift shop, a couple of restaurants including the lovely Begue's, as well as multiple bars. At the Mystick Den we saw an amazing jazz show featuring vocalist Betty Shirley. If she's playing, do not miss her.\n\nDear families, I've heard that if you stay on a room that faces out to Bourbon Street on the weekends, it can be quite loud. We were lucky to get an inside room facing the courtyard and pool. There's no reason not to go to New Orleans these days. Bring the commerce back!",

We were staying at the best western across the street and checked yelp for places within walking distance (took us 5.5 hours in lovely rush hour Atlanta traffic to get to Nashville so the last place we wanted to be was in a car). We met Lewis when we sat down (very nice guy) and ordered the edamame based on his feedback that it \"wasn't hot at all\" - Lewis, I am not sure if someone overdid it with the spices on ours but DANG it was spicy!

  "text": "BFF Cafe is AMAZING!!! \n\nI would love to show you pictures of all of the goodies we ordered, but I can't because we all just dug in and I didn't think again about pictures until I was down to a couple of bites.  LOL  Just another excuse to return soon and often.  ;)\n\nI love their menu and how it tells everything that is gluten free, diabetic-friendly, paleo, and a couple of other designations. Their item listings also show the amount of carbs, calories, etc. Most of their menu is gluten free and/or easily changed up to be gluten free.  There are SO many items I need to try ASAP.\n\nI had been wanting to go there for quite awhile, but it took family coming in from out of town (one of which is watching his carbs) to finally get there. I'm kicking myself that it took so long to get there. \n\nI think this just may be my new favorite restaurant in the area.  It's so tasty while being really healthy. They say that their cafe is your body's best friend.  It definitely fits.\n\nToday I ordered the Bison Burger with a side of Cauliflower Sticks (you can choose between several sides). My bison burger included blue cheese crumbles, spinach, balsamic reduction, heirloom tomato, and mushrooms! I chose the Cauliflower bun (one of at least 3 breads and two of them are gluten free). The whole thing was amazing! It was a bit messy because of the balsamic reduction, but nothing several napkins couldn't handle.   ;)\n\nWe also ordered the Cauliflower Pizza with chicken, red sauce, red pepper, red onion, goat cheese, mozzarella, and basil. We split this and everyone who tried it really enjoyed it.\n\nOthers ordered the Classic Cheeseburger and fries, and the following Zoodle plates: The BFF, The Clucker, and The Salmon Zoodles. They all really loved their food. All of the Zoodle items looked really tasty, but The Salmon looked the best to me out of the three. I also bought some of their Peanut Butter Balls (with chocolate chips) to share and took a loaf of Cauliflower Bread home with me.\n\nThey also have a tasty selection of drinks. Their soda machine was out of order today, but we all enjoyed a variety of specialty drinks (from bottles and cans). I had a Pomegranate Bai drink. \n\nThe staff was SO friendly and on top of their responsibilities. There is even seating outside, but we chose inside today. One of our cousins also thanked me for finding and recommending such a great place.\n\nI NEED to go back soon, because I definitely want to try their Salmon Tacos and several other dishes. This definitely feels like it will officially be named my favorite restaurant in the area really soon. I'm almost ready to declare it, but think after one more visit it will likely be official. I absolutely love how easy it is to eat gluten free there safely and have most of the menu available to me. It definitely doesn't hurt that you get some amazing tasting food there that is actually really healthy! You definitely do not find that every day!",

  "text": "I was invited by my friend Chris Cohen to try this place, which doesn't officially open to the public until today and doesn't have any sort of grand opening event for a few weeks. Despite few wrinkles they are quickly ironing out, I could see this developing into a locale where foothills residents can assemble for happy hour, sporting events, dinner, socialize, drink, etc.\n\nThe atmosphere they are attempting to create is certainly unique to the Tucson area. The attire the employees sport is derived from the late 1800's / early 1900's type of feel (forgive me if I misfired with that analogy, but I that's what comes to mind). Button-up shirts with suspenders and bow ties for the male bartender. Females wear respectable outfits that resemble that era, but I have no idea how to articulate their style. Either way, it assists the unique feel that will definitely attract people to return here. \n\nChris advised that I try a shot of this liquor, the name of which I cannot quite recall, but it tasted like mouthwash and when I swallowed it I could feel it journeying down my esophagus. It's certainly an acquired taste and I was told that most people either love it or hate it; very few fall in between. I supposed I am one of those few. Not sure I would order it again, but it certainly did the trick. \n\nI also consumed an order of Duck Fries which were absolutely fantastic and made the trip to the Foothills worthwhile. I admit, I had a drink over at Fleming's before coming to this event, and being a bit of a lightweight, I was already buzzed when I arrived at Nox. Then I had the 200 proof alcohol, so I my recollection of this may not be 100% correct, but I swear on those fries there was Parmesan cheese. The duck was cooked perfectly. It was a not-so-surprising combination that exceeded expectations. \n\nI also had some pork sliders and, to be honest, they were a little dry. The meat was a little overcooked. When I was able to locate a piece of pork that wasn't dry, it actually tasted perfect. So, it was obvious they are still ironing out some kinks with the food, which is fine for a young restaurant.\n\nWould I suggest this place to friends? Absolutely. Aside from the small issue with the pork sliders, everything about Nox surpassed what I foresaw going in. The service was professional and entertaining, yet slightly dignified. The environment was inordinately appealing (I dug the type of music they played; I don't expect to find eclectic electronic and / or downtempo  music in a region like the foothills, but that's what I heard as the night progressed. There are also so many flat-screens in that place I couldn't even count. It's a nifty indoor / outdoor restaurant where dwellers of the foothills can watch Arizona basketball, NFL Football and various other events. \n\nOh, and there are the duck fries. Did I mention those? Oh I did? Ok, well I mentioned them again. They were ridiculous (in a positive way).",

I think they have 1 Picasso and 2 Monet paintings.\n- a technology section which definitely makes you feel old...

The building itself is very modern and there's a good amount of natural light aside from certain areas where they probably don't want light to damage whatever they have on display. I have not gotten a chance to walk around the gardens yet but I definitely plan to when it gets warmer.\n\nI highly recommend the IMA.

Many of the dishes come in three and four pieces so sharing is caring! \n\nThe bacon jam, pretzel with beer cheese, pork rinds, house chips with buffalo sauce and flatbread stood out from the rest. \n\nThe bacon jam is super flavorful! The pretzels were soft and the beer cheese paired nicely. The pork rinds were the star of the show IMO. Crispy, light, and perfectly dusted with your choice of flavor. The house chips were airy and crisp as well and who doesn't love food covered in buffalo and blue cheese?! The flatbread presented more as a pizza but I just loved the crispness to it. It's what all thin crust pizzas should strive to be. \n\nWe also drank...a lot. I loved the lemon flavored drink on the happy hour menu and the dirty martini!  Both were $6 each. I mean.

  "text": "LOVE Schlafly! It was always a must-do when I came to visit my boy's fam, and now that I've moved here (from first Milwaukee, then Chicago), I am grateful to have such a wonderful place to go get good beer! It's really nice in the summer, as they have live music and a nice patio area. They also have a farmer's market here in the summer, supplying the area with fresh, local produce! They also make note of where your meal came from, which is always cool to see - because for most things, it's out of the midwest - go local! \n\nI like all their beers, but my two faves are the Coffee Stout and the Raspberry Heffe. Definitely staples in the appropriate season. You can easily sample a bunch of their beers if you go for a tour, I think between my boyfriend and I we tried them all and then some! (We also made good with the bartender, who was cool giving us a few extra - hah!) If tours bore you, they are also more than willing to give you a free taste of whatever you'd like to try up at the bar to help you decide.\n\nIf you're looking for a laid back place to go get some good food and excellent beer, definitely give Schlafly a try.",

What an awesome idea from a group of people who clearly love what they do. Great ever-changing beer selection\n\nPIZZA\nDelicious Napoletana-style pizzas with fresh ingredients. \"The Good Pie\" is the classic margherita, and the chefs even use the correct type of cheese: buffalo mozzarella. Great attention to detail- if you like this style of pizza (who wouldn't?), you can't miss this place.",

I was full after eating the sandwich and brought the pasta home for leftovers. \n\nMy mom ordered the Italian stallion sandwich- which she raved about and was also huge.

Reasonable prices.\n\nHaving moved out to the 'burbs from the city three years ago, we take advantage of any chance to frequent the restaurant scene of Center City.  Honey's has been on my list for quite some time.  And let me tell you, it didn't disappoint.  \n\nFreshest guacamole I've ever tasted.  The waitress said, \"they don't crack the avocado until you order it.\"  I had the churassco platter.  Flank steak with refried beans, rice and salsa verde.

Go try the refried beans and then tell me I'm lying.\n\nThe wife got the red and gold beet salad with baby spinach, shallots, parsley, chives, walnuts and goat cheese with tarragon vinaigrette.  She found it quite delicious.  My wife isn't a foodie like me but, as we were leaving, declared, \"We need to come back here again.\"\n\nYou hear that?

I give them four stars though, because even though I grumble while paying for a tattered ten dollar t-shirt, I love the feeling of worn cotton. Much like I love puppies and pickles. \n\nI'll be paying them a visit to see if they can help with my Halloween costume. Tis the season!\n\n(ps.

They play the sound on the Eagles game throughout the bar, and play music during commercials.  They even play the Eagles fight song after every touchdown!!  Sing with the rest of the fans!  Join the fun!\n\nIt gets packed on game day, which is the best part.  There's a free shuttle bus to take you from Chickie's to the football stadium.  There are probably 100 tables inside, so even if they quote you a 20 min wait, it never takes that long.  \n\nFood is average, bar food.  But a few quality items that I love - the CRAB FRIES!  Ripple cut french fries with old bay seasoning and cheezy whiz dip on the side!  Classic!\nI really like the crab bruchetta also.  People love the mussels, but I've had better.  The hoagies are average, good if you're drinking heavily watching the game!  The pizzas are really good, and a better value than getting hoagies.  You can even order a tower of beer that sits on your table and you pour it yourself from the tap.\n\nThis is my favorite Eagles bar in the city.  I much rather come here than the new Xfinity live complex.  Avoid the over-crowded over priced Xfinity and come to Chickies!",

The wine selection is amazing, as is pretty much the entire selection of every liquor.  The first day they were open I bought a bottle of St. Germain, a handle of Bacardi select, and a bottle of wine, for under $65, so the prices are pretty lovely as well.  The staff was super helpful and knowledgeable of the product and store layout. \n\nThis is more than a step up, this is a whole escalator up from the liquor store we used to have to deal with in Northern Liberties.  Mad Dog varieties have been replaced with fine wines and spirits.  There's short-term parking on a Girard, and a parking lot behind the store.  It's like they actually care about their customers!",

  "text": "This place is a staple in Indianapolis over in the international marketplace. Most people who have been around the city long enough and explore ethnic food have tried this joint. Now with so many other vietnamese restaurants opening all around the city, there is a lot of competition. I think that Saigon still fares pretty decently to the others in town. For one, the menu is extensive. Most vietnamese dishes that one would seek in larger more diverse metro areas are present on this menu. Secondly, the portions are very fair for the price. Taste is good imo, however, the quality of the meat is questionable. My wife is much more on the meat picky and mostly vegetarian spectrum than myself, but the way she qualifies a vietnamese cuisine is based on grilled meat quality (as she is a bún lover). I agree with her most of the time, and on saigons behalf, I agree- meat quality mediocre at best. Otherwise, definitely worth trying out.",

My moms loves the fish n chips and my girl loves the Prime Rib. \n\nThere is a really nice outdoor seating area that you can choose to use. I like to sit out there on cool evenings and enjoy a cigar with my wine. Not much better than that!\n\nQuit going to those awful chain stores down the street.

  "text": "Located in a tiny room next to deVine Wines and Spirits, Tzin Wine and Tapas literally has enough room for seven two-top tables (two people per table). That, plus a short bar, plus a corner kitchen area, constitutes the entire restaurant.\n\nIt's quite dark inside, with tabletop candles and Spanish music playing in the background - perfect for a first date, a hundredth date, or drinks with close friends and co-workers. Not, on the other hand, a family-friendly restaurant; I wouldn't recommend bringing any children here.\n\nThe wine list was quite extensive, as I expected it to be, and offered a variety of by-the-glass choices, and just as many by-the-bottle options. I tasted two red wines during my visit: the Ben Marco Malbec, Argentina (hints of blackcurrant and slightly acidic) and the Pasion Brava Tempranillo (Rioja), Spain (much sweeter, very smooth drinking). No matter your wine preference, Tzin has a variety of options to suit every taste, and the excellent service ensures that your wine glass is always topped up.\n\nTzin offers a typical tapas-style menu: a selection of small-ish dishes with a strong foundation in Spanish cuisine. Diners can either select several to share amongst their party, or choose one or two for themselves. Everything (and I mean everything) sounded delicious, so it was difficult to make a decision.\n\nIn the end, I decided to try the Olive Plate to start, since I love pairing marinated olives with wine. Alongside the olives, the plate boasted a selection of focaccia bread, olive tapenade, and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, all of which were delectable. The warm marinated olives were delicious and went extremely well with my glass of Ben Marco.\n\nFor dinner, we decided to order separate dishes, and opted for the Chorizo and Gnocchi Stew and the Chicken Breast Supreme. The stew, served with grilled flat bread, was absolutely heavenly and had a weighty tomato taste that complemented the manchego gnocchi and chorizo exceptionally well. The chicken breast dish was moist and tender, and was served on a bed of harissa couscous and dried apricots, with a dollop of minted yoghurt. Harissa is a Tunisian hot chili sauce, so the couscous understandably had a bit of a kick to it; if you don't like spicy foods, I'd advise you not to choose this dish. The spiciness isn't overpowering, but it'll set your mouth tingling if you eat enough of the couscous.\n\nWe had excellent service throughout our entire visit - the server was very friendly and accommodating - and enjoyed the chic décor, open-style kitchen, and gigantic wine rack (my next purchase).\n\nOne of the things I like best about Tzin is that they're all about the dining experience. This restaurant is about relaxing, enjoying a good glass of wine, and sampling delicious appetizers and tapas plates. They're a hole-in-the-wall restaurant simply for this reason; if they were to enlarge the space and cram in as many tables as possible, they'd lose much of the charm they get from the currently intimate, personal dining experience. \n\nIf you work downtown, if you enjoy wine and tapas, or, hell...if you live in Edmonton...you need to make a date to visit Tzin sometime soon. As I've said, and as their website stresses, they're a small restaurant, so please make the most of OpenTable and book yourself a place. Then all you need to do is sit back, quaff some wine, nibble on an appetizer, and simply experience.",

The service was a bit slow, but the owner/waiter/food runner was extremely friendly.  The restaurant was relatively full but they only had 1 waitress and the owner who functioned as a waiter/food runner.  I heard the owner telling someone that his wife makes all the food and she only makes one dish at a time...which doesn't seem like the best idea.  This may also explain why the food didn't come out piping hot.\n\nAppetizers: Fried tofu- good, but could have been crispier.  Thai papaya salad was pretty good as were the thai basil meatlballs, but I felt like it could have used some kind of dipping sauce or something since they were a bit dry.\n\nEntrees: Pad Thai- super super al dente.  Some of the noodles were basically uncooked and the pad thai was a bit dry.  My friend got the panaeng curry with duck which was actually delicious.  \n\nI will probably give this place another try.  It is relatively new so perhaps they need some time to work out some things.",

  "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but when you hand my a soy cappucino (litterally ALL FOAM) when I order a latte, we have a seriously problem here. Did I mention the fact that the espresso was literally ON FIRE hot? oh I didn't? well it was. and that made me quite sad. I have always been curious about the good karma up on 22nd, passing it constantly when driving over to see the West Philly folks. I've never had reason to stop because I was always headed somewhere, however, when this one opening up so close to my house, it was clear I could take it in for consideration. \n\nI stopped by on a walk with my dog and bf. They let me bring the dog in- massive props. The space is really lovely. It's got great high ceilings, lots of sitting room, (but all tables and chairs like a cafeteria, no cushy seating) They are open late, which is nice, but still, it's just not quite what I'm looking for. If I leave my house and walk south instead of north, I end up at Chapterhouse, and while GK is certainly nice, I also need my beverage to be on par with the aesthetics of the place, and at least at my first visit, it was not. It burnt my mouth and was 3/4 foam and 1/4 espresso and not a latte in any form of the word. \n\nI'm sure we'll try it again and at that point, I'll give it a second chance and second review, but for right now it would be my last choice for a coffee fix. Sorry guys.",

  "text": "Nice atmosphere and the place was hopping at lunch. Parking lot is small, many cars parked on residential side streets (which I'm sure the homeowners 'love').\n\nI've been to the Cantina on 3rd and not been overly impressed with their typical mexican offerings (enchiladas, tacos, burritos, etc.) so tried something more entree oriented - the Shrimp Al Mojo De Ajo (sautéed shrimp in a buttery tasting tomato and garlic sauce) with rice and veg - shrimp was nicely sauteed and tender, veg were nicely prepared - al dente green beans and carrots. Good dish, but nothing I will be dreaming about. Price was $11 which is reasonable for this dish but I find their prices for typical mex fare over priced for mediocre food. One complimentary basket of chips per table and you have to ask for it. Salsa is nothing interesting.\n\nGood service.",

  "text": "A kid, or an adult that is a kid at heart would love this whimsical dreamy dessert haven. These are the phrases that comes to mind when I envision Creole Creamery. The exterior and interior aesthetics scream antique candy/malt shop and it smells awesome once you step foot inside. When I walk inside, I immediately look at the giant chalkboard that list the current flavors. Note: Some flavors are subject to change. On my last visit I tried the Creole Strawberry Sundae-- Fresh strawberries served over a mound of our famous creole cream cheese ice cream topped with whipped cream, a cherry, and a wafer, which came in a huge sundae glass, topped with dips of creole cream cheese flavored ice cream, fresh strawberries and graham cracker. It looked too cute to bite into so I made sure to take a photo and upload it first. Then I took the first bite and seen rainbows. I am very dramatic but I like--well--love Creole Creamery and wish I lived down the street as a kid vs. Dairy Queen. I feel robbed. If you want, they offer samples to taste and try different unique flavors like Lavender Honey, which is also good. Next time, I am going to try either another sundae or Ice Cream Sampler--\n--4 mini scoops or  6 mini scoops--so that I can try more awesome frozen goodness. \nOh, and bring cash, this place is true to tradition, no fancy cards to swipe in this place.",

  "text": "A habit is slowly forming between the boyfriend and I that we'd go out for Saturday lunch meal, and amongst our favorite food had to be burgers. After going out for PYT at the piazza and loving it, we decided it's a bit far for us to go there every week, so after looking around Yelp, we settled for 500 Degrees. It earns point from me just by naming it a numeric symbol.\n\nOutside the door, there's a burger of the week sign with some interesting concept burgers.  Upon entering and after reading the menu, I asked for a \"Heat Lover Combo\" and I repeated myself 3 times because apparently the server has never heard of the Heat Lover before and I have to point at the sign right next to the cash register and tell him I want that burger in a combo. In which he told me that the special burgers don't come available in a combo. Huh? Is it so difficult to put that in a combo deal like all the regular burgers they have here? (After reviewing their facebook page, apparently a lot of burgers of the week comes in a combo pack, so I don't know what the problem was)\n\nAnyway, after ordering that and a 500 burger combo with mushrooms, we sat at the well lit dining room and started analyzing. The burgers were quite superb, perfect sized, good soft buns with a juicy, soft, meaty patty that goes perfectly with the cheddar. The special sauce in the 500 burger is tasty and the bacon added some crispiness. The grill has slightly charred the outside and give it a smokiness that's ever so alluring. The special sauce and a lite dijon mustard is also served at the table that undoubtedly enhance the flavor of any burgers.\n\nThe Heat Lover burger has a lovely pickled jalapeno peppers on top that tickle the taste buds but not enough to give you an intense heat. The spicy fries and the truffle fries are also a bit weak in flavor, so was my chocolate shake. I wonder if the fries can benefit with just a tad more salt and pepper or the flavoring it promised. The fries are also a bit on the soft side. \n\nThe burger outweighs the bad, with a well lit place and an affordable menu, it's still very much worth coming back again. I'll definitely come back a few more times for weeks to come.",

There's a beautiful mural on the wall and tables and chairs for dining in.  We walked in not realizing it was almost 2pm and not realizing they close at 2pm (Saturday).  I had an aha moment and realized it, so I said we would come back.  The owner happened to be at the counter and was so genuinely welcoming and said it was fine.  I really appreciated that kind of customer consideration.  I commented about the coffee, and she explained it is sourced from Puerto Rico and is roasted by Julian Coffee Roasters in Zionsville.  They have about 5 or 6 sandwiches on the menu, and we opted for the Cuban.  What a great choice!  I love Cuban sandwiches, and theirs is straightforward and delicious and now one of the top on my list.  We also had a delicious chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  I definitely would do it all again.  I'm really happy to see Pia get in on the ground floor of this up and coming area.  It's slow going, but the whole area is on the verge of revitalization, and Pia is a much needed bright spot as one of the starters of the movement.",

Normally I'd be all for the chocolate caramel but it seemed very dry to me. The carrot was my favorite out of the bunch. They have excellent comfy chairs that recline back. It is very relaxing. They also have beer and wine so it's an excellent place to go for a small dessert and drink. Def check it out.",

She kept looking me over incredulously, no doubt because of my costume (I was fully clothed. I am no harlot!). Even by the end of our meal she didn't know what to make of me, aptly confused by my spot-on manners. I digress.\n\nPop N Sons has a great variety of affordable meal options on their menu. I settled on the country fried steak dinner and Christoph opted for the meatloaf. \n\nWe were both pleased with the speed in which our food came out. The speed did not sacrifice the quality at all, and in no time flat we were stuffed to the gills. The only part of my meal I would've changed was how peppery the sausage gravy was on my steak. Other than that, everything was up to snuff (including their rich macaroni & cheese). \n\nThe food is comforting here, and so is the atmosphere. This diner is a blast from the past, and even their music adds to the 50's ambiance. My sweetie & I will definitely be making a return appearance!",

It is always a convenient place being located right by campus but without the raucous atmosphere of University Ave.  I've worked my way through the menu and a lot is mediocre but there are a few stand outs.  Don't miss the fish and chips.  The fish is super crispy and the waffle fries are great (when they aren't soggy).  This is really the best thing on the menu.  If you are feeling in a soup mood, the clam chowder is solid.  The crabcake is pretty decent too and will remind you of the mid-atlantic coast.  Which brings me to... if you are Redskins fan, this is your home.  I used to work on a couple Redskins shows back in DC, so of all the NFL teams, I have a special place in my heart for the \"burgundy and gold\", underdogs that they are.  I love the atmosphere here for games.  There is something special about going to a bar dedicated to one team and everyone there is rooting together.  On another note, the owner Nelson is very involved in the community and has kind of been a fixture in Tucson forever.  If you are a Navy guy, you'll love Nelson.",

  "text": "I'm a big fan of Top Chef winner Kevin Sbraga and his eponymous restaurant at the Symphony House - Sbraga. So it's a no-brainer that the GF and I would check out Juniper Commons, his 80's themed outpost across the street. The GF loves any themed concept, but I'm down with any Chef that can turn out a deliciously decadent foie gras soup.\n\nSo we pushed past all the negativity surrounding the supposedly regressive concept and decided to stop by for a pre-theater dinner. Some say the 1980s was one of the ugliest decades for decor, but the design here was still sleek and open. They even have a fire pit in the open kitchen - perfect to roast a prime rib or a 32 oz. steak.\n\nBread Service\nZucchini bread\n\nService started off with some zucchini bread, provided with a pat of butter topped with sea salt. Moist and studded with raisins and walnuts, this was a delicious, yet surprisingly sweet start to the meal. \n\nPimm's Cup [$12]\nPimms, lemon, cucumber, strawberry\n\nThe GF can't be denied her Pimm's Cup and Juniper Commons' iteration was appropriately fruity, light, and refreshing.\n\nPoint Breeze [$12]\nBluecoat gin, grapefruit, rose \n\nConsidering the name of the restaurant and the theme, you'd expect a great gin program which Juniper Commons has in spades. This tipple featured Philly-based Bluecoat. The floral notes were rendered more complex with the addition of grapefruit and rose. Himalayan pink salt studded the rim.\n\nPeel n' Eat Shrimp Cocktail [$15]\nCocktail sauce, lemon\n\nThese Florida Sun shrimp were nicely poached, shell-on. The GF wasn't a fan of working for her food, but we both enjoyed these substantial and snappy crustaceans nonetheless. The accompanying cocktail sauce was sweet, with a nice horseradish kick.\n\nFried Smelts [$8]\nChili pepper aioli, lemon\n\nWhile not exactly this year's pork belly, you do see fried smelts gaining ground. And why not? It's the perfect salty bar snack for those who enjoy fish. Head-on, these fishy fries were aggressively seasoned and had a thin, crisp batter, with the bones within offering even more texture. The chili pepper aioli had some acid and kick to balance out the weight of the flaky and meaty fish. \n\nEggplant Fritters [$16]\nEggplant relish, mozzarella curds, pomodoro sauce    \n\nThis dish was definitely redolent with the components of eggplant parm. The pomodoro sauce was well developed with the fresh herbs providing additional flavor. The mozzarella curds were chewy nuggets of gold. Still, the eggplant was inconsistently cooked. The relish was great - well roasted and packed with seasoning. But a few of the crispy fritters showcased eggplant that was extremely chewy and gummy, rather than tender. A decent dish that could have been better executed.\n \nLobster Roll [$26]\nMayo, celery salt, drawn butter, chives, potato roll\n\nOn the other hand, the GF's lobster roll was top notch. It doesn't get better than a perfectly buttered and toasted potato roll, packed with huge chunks of sweet lobster with minimal dressing. A pat of pickled veggies provided some balance between bites. Almost overshadowing the lobster roll were the beef fat fries. Thick-cut and properly fried, each bite was lightly crisp, yet melted upon mastication. In fact, one of the servers who stopped by to chat described them as being seductive. Considered me seduced.\n\nPinot Noir Wine Cooler [$9]\nApple brandy, blackberry \n\nThere wasn't a dessert menu on hand, but of the few offerings rattled off by our server, none seemed to surpass our need for a Salty Pimp from Big Gay Ice Cream next door. Still, I had to end the meal with one of Juniper Commons' wine coolers - bottled in-house, sparkling, and slightly chilled. This was easy drinking - light fruit with a brandy buttress. \n\nService as a whole was very good, with a friendly hostess and a manager that stopped by to check on things. While there were some inconsistencies in the eggplant dish, everything else was well-executed and delicious. For the naysayers, I don't think the point is to blow you away with creative twists on classics. They're classics for a reason. The lobster rolls are done right and their raw bar is fresh. I highly recommend popping in during Happy Hour for some fried smelts and a drink or two. Lastly, you're failing at life if you don't order the beef-fat fries.",

When visiting my hometown over the holidays I frequently visit here as it is in a great location and perfect place to meet up with a group of people. The bar area is not huge but has a nice atmosphere. They have a great draft and bottle list. The beers can be pricey but they great variety they have makes it worth it. On my last visit I got a pomegranate beer of some sort that was fantastic. My friends ordered chocolate martinis which they loved.  There is also a dining room with lots of seating options. I recommend this for families or large parties.  The menu is huge often times overwhelming. The have entrees and typical bar food of hoagies, burgers and pizzas.  My favorite is there ovals which are specialty like pizzas but often with no sauce. On our last visit we got the chicken cheesesteak oval which was fantastic-all of their cheesesteak hoagies are delicious as well.",

  "text": "Oh, how I wish we could do half stars.  This place doesn't quite deserve 4 stars.\n\nI decided to try El Camino Real on a Tuesday night since it's impossible to get a table on a weekend (see my review of Bar Ferdinand). \n\nWalking in last night ECR immediately endeared itself to me.  Cibo Matto was playing! Throughout the whole night there was a super fun mix of 80's and 90's music. It was great. Of course it's neither Mexican or Texan, but great nonetheless.  We are in Philly, after all.  I even got the pleasure of watching a server dance like M.C. Hammer. \n\nThe food was delicious.  The pig wings are a stellar idea. Their blue cheese is super strong. The pig wings aren't spicy at all, just wonderfully cooked. My friend and I ordered the brisket sandwich and the short rib sandwich.  We both joked about how the kitchen seemed to throw whatever toppings they felt like on the sandwiches.  The sandwiches are huge, thanks in part to the thick sliced toast. None of the sauces were very hot, but the fries are super spicy. I eventually gave up trying to eat them. \n\nThe place has a great selection of drinks and food.  It's really hard to decide what to order if it's your first time there. The service was decent, if a little slow towards the end.  \n\nThe reason I really want to under-rate ECR is how our leftovers were handled. My friend and I both asked to have our food wrapped up.  We each had half of a sandwich, a plate full of fries, and sauce. So the server packs it up, puts it in a plastic bag and places it all next to my friend.  Now, I think I need to state two things.  One, I was in the bathroom when my friend asked to have the food packed up so I don't really know if something was said and misunderstood. Two, my friend is male and I am female (and super pretty! just kidding). But you can imagine my surprise when we get back to my place and attempt to divvy up the food. \n\nThey use the foil containers that fold over a cardboard top. So they aren't super easy to open and close. The first container is our sauces in two plastic containers. Weird, and annoying since it's a waste of packaging.  The second container was only fries.  Both of our fries, combined! The third container was the top piece of bread to each of our sandwiches.  And finally, the fourth was the bottoms to our sandwiches. I'm not sure why our server decided to combine our meals in so intimate a way.  Maybe he assumed we were a couple and heading to the same place?  Even so, that's pretty brazen, and totally out of the norm. \n\nThe place is so popular on Yelp, I really wanted to love it. But in the end, I was just weirded out by their packaging of the leftovers.  Weird.",

But, I LOVED it!  This place belongs in Denver, it's so hip!\n\nThe donut selection wasn't overly huge but I had no problem finding one I wanted -- Pistachio Brown Butter -- and that thing blew me away!  It was fresh and soft and warm and those flavors were incredible.  Basically, it as everything I thought Voodoo was going to be.  \n\nBonus points for having milk, iced coffee, orange juice and water on tap.  Seriously, so hip.  It's probably a good thing I don't live in New Orleans, otherwise my \"It's vacation, I can have a donut\" mentality would probably quickly change to \"It's (insert any day of the week), I can have a donut.\"",

This is where I take my guests who are here for the first time and they want a little taste of nature without dying due to altitude issues. There are hikes galore in this area, from the very simple and accessible mile-long loop (perfect for after dinner exercise) or the more strenuous trails that lead to ridge tops with fantastic views of the valleys and lake. During the summer, come early to avoid crowds. During winter, snow shoes are a fun activity. Very dog friendly. Oh, and let's not forget Chickadee Ridge where if you come with some bird seed, those chirpy little buggers will come and sit on your hand.",

  "text": "Like many stores that line Baltimore Avenue in West Philly, Mood Cafe is privately owned and a sister store to Desi Village and Desi Chaat House. I have frequented Desi Chaat House more often because they have more variety of chaat, but Mood Cafe has more lassi options. I really like their lassi because it isn't that sweet, and my favourite is cardamom lassi. It has a slight tanginess from the yoghurt and just the right amount of cardamom flavour. It's actually really refreshing to drink on a very hot day. Mango lassi is very good also, once again with just the right sweetness and enough mango flavour. This time I ordered Kashmiri chaat and asked mine to be medium spicy. I love eating chaat during the summer months because it's refreshing and kind of helps my appetite when you don't want to eat anything. Just in case you don't know, chaat is one of the favourite Indian street food with all kinds of possible combination of veggies, crunchy Indian snacks, fruits, sauces, and yoghurt. The potential of combination seems endless. \n\nMood Cafe is rather small for an eat in. They do have limited chairs and tables. I chose to do a take out (which most times seems more convenient). The service is really friendly and pretty efficient. I think they over made their mango lassi they gave me the extra portion in a small cup! If you are new to this area of West Philly you can choose to eat in, or take your food and drink over to Clark Park and have a picnic!",

  "text": "After seeing a photo of the porchetta sandwich in the newest issue of Sauce, I knew we had to check the place out. From the prior bad reviews it seems like the owners of this place really listened to te customers and did an overhaul of the menu, and oh man was everything we had  was fantastic. \n\nWe started off with the trio of bruschetta which is listed on the menu as the following: 1) House ricotta, walnut pesto & basil 2) Oyster mushrooms, Heartland Creamery goat cheese & fried sage 3) Grilled leeks, romesco & chives.  \n*Served on grilled house bread\n\nAll the options were delicious, our favorite was the one with the oyster mushrooms and fried sage, I could have eaten three of them alone.\n\nFor our main courses I got the pork belly with pickled vegetable salad which was on the small plate section. Wow. The pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious with uber crispy skin on it, and there was a small splash of a sherry reduction sauce that went really well with it. As for the pickled vegetable salad, today I learned I like pickled beets! It had pickled beets, pearl onions, mustard seeds and another thing I forget. It was soooo good.\n\nBoyfriend got the porchetta sandwich and it was as good as I expected it to be. He absolutely loved it, I thought it needed a little something else but he disagreed. The pork was really great and the bread it was served on was delicious as well.\n\nAlso our server was super nice and attentive! \n\nI was going to give market grill 4 stars because it feels really stark inside and the art is hideous, but the food was so good I can look over it. I mean we are here for the food, right?\n\nIf you've previously given Market Grill a poor review, I really urge you to give them another shot.",

The tacos are simple, affordable, and delicious.\n\n2) Friendliness: You'll see a lot of the same bar staff here as you will at Radio Radio... same folks... and they've always been very fast and very friendly. When we got our food here, the cook even brought out a bunch of homemade hot sauces for us to try... and when we said that we loved spicy things, he went back and got even spicier stuff... and he gave us some free chips to sample all of them. Very friendly and helpful.\n\n3) Atmosphere, this place has a great feel to it. The right amount of antique combined with the right amount of modern.\n\nNow, the limited amount of things that could be improved:\n\n1) Seating: I'd never been here before, so a sign that says 'Seat yourself' would have been handy.\n\n2) Wait staff: Except for the little type face on the little menu at the table that says to 'Order at the Bar'...there is no indication that there is no wait staff.\n\nMinor details, but I prefer not to show up to a restaurant and wonder about the logistics.\n\nAll in all, a great place to grab a quick bite to eat, especially if time is of the essence and you're catching a show afterwards in Fountain Square.",

  "text": "FYI: They have a full bar and outdoor seating on the sidewalk, but they also have plenty of seating on the inside, though their table layout makes for some narrow walkways.\n\nOn a Friday night during prime dinner time, the fiancé and I were searching for somewhere to eat after running some errands in center city. We always walk by this place so I've always wanted to try it but the opportunity never came up until today.\n\nWHAT WE GOT: Grilled chicken margherita flatbread, grilled salmon, scallops dinner special\n\nPROS: Nice decor/ambiance with friendly and attentive staff. The kitchen is on full display on the side of the restaurant but it adds a nice touch to the place. The food was pretty okay; nothing super special but nothing to be mad at either. The price matched the portion sizes and the freshness of the food. Loved the sweet but tangy honey mustard glaze on my salmon, which was cooked nicely. The mashed potatoes were also pretty good and so was the flatbread. I mean you can't really go wrong with chicken, cheese, and pesto.\n\nCONS: The asparagus that came with the dish were a bit cold and my fiancé's risotto and spinach were both kinda sort on seasoning. It also took a little bit for the appetizer to come out even though the restaurant wasn't really busy. There's also minimum walking space in between some of the tables. \n\nRandom thoughts from the fiancé: Our waiter Tyler was friendly and provided great service. It seemed though that his area was kinda spread out and disjointed with some tables being inside and some being outside which slowed service down. He also looked and sounded like Vin Diesel which was amusing.",

  "text": "First night in Nashville, after a long car ride, ready to get a taste of that night life!!  Great place to start.\n\nFood: Started with the SHISHITO PEPPERS, def glad I did.  These are perfectly charred.  Cooked well, so that they are still a little crisp and not soggy.  Lightly salted.  Greatest part, they give a little pile of sea salt on the side, so you can season to your liking!!  Be careful with these.  Some of the peppers have a super spicy kick.\n  \nBUFFALO CAULIFLOWER was another starter.  This app was a bit too sour for me.  The tanginess was pretty potent that I could not focus on any other flavors.  Also, the exterior of the cauliflower was not that crispy.  More on the soggier side.  Not a fan.  Pass on this.\n  \nTURKEY BLT was a good choice.  The pretzel bread was nice and chewy.  Lovely choice of bread for this sammy.  Wonderfully smoked turkey with crispy bacon.  Comes together beautifully with the smooth gruyere cheese, and the creamy avocado aioli.  Great textures and tastes that really comes together in this sammy.  I got it with the Tuscan tavern fries.  Nice and crunchy fries.  Def try.\n\nSMORES on the tabletop.  Even comes with a small campfire.  Classic fix'ns for smores: graham crackers, marshmellows, and chocolate bar.  In addition, some strawberries and reese's peanut butter cups.  Was quite the indoor smores experience.\n\nService: Drinks were full, food got to the table fresh and hot, server was attentive, and table was cleared away promptly.  All together, I think it was a good experience.\n\nAmbiance: Very casual.  Rustic and slightly romantic.  Nice for a girls gathering, as well as date night. \n  \nDranks: Great selection of beers, wines, and specialty cocktails.  A little something for everyone.  I had wine that night, but def would like to go back and try one of their cocktails.  \n \nOverall: A place that I would like to visit again.  Food was good.  Drinks were good.  This is a place that you can go, no pressure, find something to eat, and get your drink on.  Enjoy!!",

All other past experiences here have always been great -- the food was delicious and the perfect amount of spice & kick, the griddle meats were fried to the perfect amount of juiciness and crunch, and the cumin dishes were just mouthwateringly fantastic... but tonight, such fond food memories are gone.\n\nPros:\n-- Unusually quick service... normally there would be a ~15 minute wait time for our food to arrive, but tonight it was out to our table within 5 minutes of us placing our order (not sure if the speediness contributed to the lack of flavor in our dishes)\n-- Rice here is really good. They steam it with the right amount of water to produce perfect, white fluffy rice grains.\n-- They have a new menu that has a lot of pictures (great for individuals new to Szechuan cuisine) \n\nCons:\n-- Cumin Chicken had no flavor, whatsoever (the onions had more flavor than the chicken)\n-- Boiled Beef was way more oily than I last remembered it. I remember the dish being more soup base with chili oil as a flavoring agent and/or enhancer. This time around, it seemed the beef and cabbage were just sitting in a bowl of chili oil and no soup broth.\n-- They have lowered the standard spice level they once cooked at...\n\nIf this is the new quality standard Red Kings 2 cooks at, I am greatly saddened. My housemates and I loved coming here for warming food during bitter, cold nights. Now, we will have to look elsewhere for delicious, late night eats within Chinatown.",
