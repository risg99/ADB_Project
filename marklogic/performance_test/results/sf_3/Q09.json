I have nothing but good things to say about this local dry cleaner. \n\nThey are conveniently located off of Himes and Henderson Blvd. Their prices are reasonable. They are open on Sundays. Their staff is friendly, attentive, and efficient. The turnaround time on your dry cleaning is very quick. They have alteration services here. But, most importantly, they have a drive-thru for lazy people like me!!",

  "text": "A decent hotel near the Vieux Carré and in the up and coming Warehouse District. And with a brand new bar and restaurant just opened in the lobby it makes for a convenient start or end to your day. Plus the Coffee and Beignet Co. breakfast annex to the side has some tasty pastries and snacks as well as some of the best beignet in Nola, without the lines. \n\nThe rooms are adequate for anyone's needs, good sized with a fridge and safe included. A rooftop pool and small gym make a morning workout relatively easy, probably necessary after the excesses the city is known for. Wifi was not included in the room so we had to go to the lobby to use the guest access. Our room overlooked the lobby from the 4th floor and on the 2nd day I discovered that the wifi signal was strong enough to reach there.\n\nWe booked on one of the big online travel websites so also got a good deal for the stay. Initially wanting to stay in the Vieux Carré, we did not find the rooms we needed,  and settled, we thought, on this hotel outside the demarcation. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as that area is a horrible place to stay unless you want to be in congested streets and around inebriated guest 24/7. Here taxis are quick to find, with speedy route access to other parts of the city and nearby trolley car accessibility much easier as well. Added bonus was that Rouses Market was an 8 minute walk away - the Nola equivalent of Whole Foods with far better prices and full of local products. \n\nI'll be back.",

  "text": "Sugar....awwww honey honey! \n\nThis is a great corner brunch spot! On a lazy Sunday we strolled to Honeys Sit & Eat at the 4th street location for a late brunch. Honeys is a hip-sty cool spot with close seating & fun bar area.\nChalkboard menus adorn the walls with daily specials. Diner glass domes of sweets line the counter along with refreshed coffee cups and chatting locals. \n\nI love the laid back atmosphere of Honey's. The hostess was friendly and offered menus for kiddos and sat us right away. Our server was as laid back as can be but friendly.\n\nWe ordered the well known potato latkes with sour cream. These are fantastic and a must order. Crispy on the outside, squishy potato mash on the inside. My 8 year old devoured his immediately.\n\nLa Columbe coffee served here. A++ for that!\n\nKids had the egg sandwich on brioche bun & single pancake filled with chocolate. Pancakes are huge so for kiddos one is more than enough. My kids polished their plates... Thumbs up from the mini peeps.\n\nMy husband had the French toast special which was caramelized coconut & banana. Holy moly.. Yum! Gooey and sweet.\n\nI had the Toad In Hole which was by far my favorite. Hollandaise soaked Challah bread with a poached egg in the center topped with melted Jack cheese and truffle oil. Served with a side of spicy arugula with a tart lemon vinaigrette. To die for. The flavors were amazing together and the portion was just enough. \n\nOverall good experience. Only downside was we saw a couple come in and they sat so long without being served that they got up & walked out. Sadly they missed out on a crazy good toad in hole!",

It's a cool place, nice set-up. I would expect to pay about $20 per person, which makes it not a regular place to go. I wouldn't go back because the places in NYC are the same price but a lot better.

I had a crepe with prosciutto, fresh mozz, tomato, arugula, and added grilled eggplant and zucchini. My additions made this over the top amazing! The size was great too. My cappuccino was so so good.

I do wish there were more areas to sit and eat your ribs.  My juggling skills aren't that great yet.  It also appears they have spaced the participants out more- nice\n\nThis year there seems to be more rib venders and they have made an extra leg off the main strip that has four more places for food- so don't over look these guys. The new hot item was deep fried peach slices   Otherwise the usual lemonade stands, funnel cakes and Carmel apple spots\n\nThere did seem to be a few less craft venders and they have been moved more west and towards the back. Also there was a small kiddie carnival\n\nThey still have the two stages with live band. \n\nSome places accept credit cards in case you run out of cash.

I visited this place under the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, and I ended up enjoying myself.  The shrimp \"en cocotte\" was well- cooked (with the most perfect McEwan and Sons grits of course).  The husband's jagerschnitzel was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste to it (I noticed ham bits - is that tasso?).  His meal included a soup and a dessert, which was a steal for $23.  The seafood gumbo tasted alright though the rice tasted old and dry. The profiteroles were a nice touch even when we were all stuffed by the end of the meal.  \n\nEuropean with a Cajun flair - not too shabby a place.  I'm glad I tried this place but there wasn't anything that wowed me from this place.",

Elizabeth has many years of retail/clothing experience and it shows in the great eye she has for the styles and lines she carries. Not everything is to my taste (we will never agree about pre-ripped jeans), but there are always quite a few things to tempt me. The sale rack in the back is typically full of bargains. She carries GREAT and affordable accessories and I love the sunglasses she carries, so much so that I currently am rotating 3 pairs. \n\nLove that she supports other small business owners via trunks shows for various local jewelry, hat, purse makers. And, of course, Toulouse is a great shop ambassador. \n\nHey Yelp - can I give Fairy 17million stars?",

This is a successful fast food vegan establishment, yet it is not my favorite,  In an increasingly crowded market of health fast-food dining options in Philadelphia, Hip City Veg does some things well and other things not so well.  I do like their Udon noodle salad but in my mind there is much too much arugula and too little of the other tasty ingredients be they peanuts, chicken substitute, daikon, scallions or even udon itself. for the price. It would more accurately be named an arugula salad.  There are absolutely no condiments out for people to use.  Aww c'mon guys!  I did ask and received a little Sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit.  The sweet potato fries are good but again the portion is small in relation to the price in my opinion. There is free water which is nice to have.

  "text": "I wanted to like Mr. B's. Unfortunately, I don't think our server wanted us to like Mr. B's. \n\nWe wanted to have some post brunch drinks somewhere closer to our hotel. Since we were only drinking, not eating, we made sure to tell the hostess that, because their bar area was full. She sat us at a dining table anyway, even after we asked if she was sure it was okay. We didn't want to inconvenience them, but it was 3pm and there was no evident mealtime rush. She assured us it was fine.\n\nClearly, NOT fine. It takes a lot to make me feel guilty for drinking (sorry for partying), but I immediately felt the disapproval from our server. When we had to tell him that we were just drinking (couldn't the hostess have told him that?), there was some major attitude. When he brought us our first round of drinks, he asked if this would be the only round. It just seemed rush, weird, and full of 'tude. I imagine they aren't hurting for business since they have a prime location for hungry tourists that don't feel like looking any further, but that's also probably the same reason they can get away with being a little rude. \n\nIf it wasn't for the supreme politeness and friendliness from other New Orleans restaurants, then maybe my standards wouldn't be so high, but Mr. B's fell short of the outstanding customer service we experienced at virtually every other establishment, yes, even the to-go daiquiri shops.",

  "text": "No Yelp Elite member reviews yet? Hmm, okay, let me take a stab at it. \n\nI had bought a Groupon for Dawna Ara and it was soon to expire. So I tried calling but I didn't get a response. In the voicemail, she prompted to book via the website. You check the website and the only date that was available was the day after the Groupon's expiration date.\n\nHmm...Plan B.\n\nDecides to email her directly and email Groupon just in case I can't use it. Groupon responsed and said they would give me credit in Groupon money if I never used the deal. Dawna also responded and after exchanging a few emails, we had settled on a date.  So if you have problem getting through her, I would say email is the way to go.\n\nThe date arrived and finding this place wasn't too difficult via GPS. However, it's a residential building and does not have any company name posted. Look for the house with the little white fence.  I walked in and just saw candles lit and chairs with literature on the table. I also saw an Iphone but I figured that was hers. I was finally greeted by Dawna after what looks like the owner of the building came in and shut the door. \n\nDawna does everything herself. So there's a bit of a wait before, during, and after the session. This was my first time at acupuncture and I actually did feel something working immediately after I finished the treatment. I came in for multiple ailments but she concentrated on the main aspect of my problem. BTW, the treatment was relaxing since I was lying down for 30 minutes but the actual treatment was a little bit shorter than I expected compare to the other reviewers. Also the massage was a bit shorter than I expected. Nevertheless, this place should be tranquil enough after she updates it with some furnishings since it is really bare at the moment. Thus, not bad for the Groupon rate. Note to add, if you ever check out the bathroom, it feels a bit slanted.",

  "text": "Coco's Cocina is right across the street from the Broadway Theatre of Pitman and next to Sweet Lula's, a nice, traditional Italian restaurant owned by the same couple. But you really don't need these directions. You'll easily find Coco's while driving down the street. You can't miss the glamorous, flashy, bright red signage. It's right in the heart of town.\n\nWalk in to find a BYO, seat-yourself establishment and offers a seriously affordable menu. Chips and salsa, or guac, or queso, run about $4. All entrees (regular or wet burritos, tacos any style,  quesadillas, etc., with preferred protein/veg) are $9 and come with rice and your choice of pinto or refried beans. Keep in mind it IS \"Tex-Mex\" in that nothing is overly spicy; therefore, it is a good eatery for folks who don't mix it up much with their diets or want a \"tame\" meal. You can add hot sauce, however.\n\nThe vibe inside is very relaxed with a good number of tables and a food truck mural with a window that peeks into the kitchen. A jingle rings each time food is sitting and ready to be served. Mexican sodas, regular fountain pours, and virgin margaritas are available as drink options.\n\nSo originally here (before writing all that basic info), I included the long story of the visit with my mom from earlier this week. But it bored me so I deleted it. Basically the experience culminated with owner/chef/puppeteer/entertainer Anthony Asbury sitting at our table coaxing her to eat churros for the first time. It was hilarious but probably one of those \"you had to be there\" moments. But I will say that both owners are super friendly/funny/accommodating, and those qualities clearly align with their effective business operations.\n\nMy mom and I split the chips and queso app to start. Both the chips and the dip were delicious. No kick. If you want queso with a kick, go down the street to the other Mexican spot in town.\n\nFor my meal, I had the chicken tinga quesadilla. Again, no kick, nothing fancy, but just good, gooey toasted tortilla with chicken. The addition of sour cream with lettuce on the side was nice. I also really enjoyed my rice and would probably ask to get two sides of it instead of the beans in the future.\n\nMy mom had the pork carnitas tacos. The entree comes with three, and you get your choice of shell. She went with crispy, and liked them. As mentioned, she also had the churros (with Jack Daniel's bourbon butterscotch sauce) and ate them all rather quickly despite complaints of them being \"too hot.\" I had a bite and would definitely save more room for them in the future.\n\nI really enjoyed my first visit to this new spot in Pitman. It's good for any occasion and will likely hold a spot in my take-out rotation.",

We opted for plain wonton soup for our toddler, but none the less impressive!\n\nMy husband had the adult version of the Pho with meatballs and brisket - the large was under $8.  I had the vermicelli bowl with steak, shrimp, and spring rolls which was $10.\n\nThe fish sauce was seasoned nicely and I appreciated the 3 options of hot sauce on our table in addition to hoisson sauce.\n\nI enjoyed everything except the shrimp... next time, I'll just order the steak and spring roll vermicelli for $2 less - $8 (a great price!).\n\nEverything tasted fresh and full of flavor.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like... I asked for a half cup of rice for my toddler to have with her bowl of wont ton soup... and we were charged $2.00 for 10 cents worth of rice.  \n\nI did notice that their menu had bubble tea!  We ran out of time on this particular visit but I look forward to trying their bubble tea next time!  There was an entire page of specialty drinks at the back of the menu - smoothies, shakes, pearl tea, etc.\n\nWe will definitely return again - although, I'll skip the $2.00 1/2 cup of plain white rice, lol!",

  "text": "The burritos are huge and I chose the shredded pork. Okay, now I am really excited! I have not had a burrito this good since living in the Southwest, in fact it was one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to eat. Loaded with spicy shredded pork, rice, beans, peppers, onions, bits of corn, peas and carrots here and there, yes Americanized, but awesome. You do find them with these fillings in the SW, but in Mexico it is a basic spicy meat, rice and beans. Truly remarkable and this alone will bring me back. \n\nThe tamale was wrapped in an real corn husk instead of one of those plastic imitations you find today. The masa filling or corn dough was very dry and bland, there was one good sized chunk of white meat pork in the center and nothing else. The dough was pure white, which makes me wonder if they even attempted to add chili powder or cumin to the mixture and it desperately needed salt and pepper. In an attempt not to waste food, I spooned a good quarter of a cup of salsa on it that was loaded with peppers. Still not loving it, I spooned some refried beans on, I came this close to topping it with guacamole and decided that my stomach had enough. \n\nThe refried beans are good, but once again needed salt and pepper. I always Americanize them anyway by adding raw onion and cheddar cheese. The fresh guac was loaded with chunks of avocado, a nice balance of citrus and tomatoes with a bit of heat, I detected no red onion, but it did taste as if they put onion powder in it. It was still very good and they claim it is award winning. \n\nTorn between the mango salsa or the fruit salsa, I chose the fruit, since it had large chucks of peach and mango in it, as well as blueberries, strawberries, pineapple and sweet red peppers. Well this tall young man who was scooping out my fresh fruit salsa kept knocking the chunks of mango off the spoon. I finally told him to knock it off, not really, but I did ask what he was doing and asked for mango! I mean come on, give it up if you want me to return. It was very good and fresh, a bit vinegary \n\nThey also have a black bean salsa, beans and rice and beautiful looking layered cheese, imported cheese and chorizo, which I do need to try. They carry flour tortillas, as well as corn and a variety of corn chips, canned sauces and peppers. The feta and lime salsa is on my list to try the next time. \n\nThe Chicken Enchilada is small but excellent! Just the right amount of heat and filled with shredded chicken and spices. Of course after my initial bite, which was good enough, I topped it with cheese, heated it a bit more to melt it and added some hot salsa and some fresh guacamole, yum! \n\nThey really do have a great menu of four different taco's, quesadillas, eight burritos including a breakfast one with egg and chorizo, nachos galore, empanadas, chimichangas, Chile rellenos, shrimp cerbice, Mexican slaw and Mexican Jarrito to drink as well as state side soda pops. Hot platters are served with sides. \n\nAll of these Mexican specialties are to each come with sour cream, guacamole and Pico de gallo, when I got home and opened my bag the tall, handsome young man who was hoarding the mango did not give me any, not one little dollop and I'm telling! It was a good thing that I had sour cream and salsa at home and bought the guacamole. Open Thursday through Saturday only. \n\nAdmittedly I over ordered and ate this for days while hubby had two Cornish game hens, corn on the cob and wild rice. I was not jealous and of course I had to make a batch of margarita's to wash it all down. When we went to the Chart House last week, he said, \"Now you can not order everything on the menu so that you can yelp it\". Every party has a pooper...",

I particularly liked the specials written on a large piece of rolling paper (think paper towels). They can rip out the old sheet, pull down for a clean sheet to write the new specials on. Creative! The hostess was a bit rude but our waitress was super sweet. \n\nOrdered Tom Yum, Beef Pad See Ewe and Pineapple Curry with brown rice. All very flavorful, spicy dishes that kept me eating and eating. We had the mango sticky rice for dessert but that wasn't too good. The mangos were amazing but they used black sticky rice and didn't cook it long enough. It was dry and hard still. But nevertheless, the other dishes and overall feel of the restaurant still deserves 4 stars from me. I left full, happy, satisfied and wishing I could fit more in my tummy.",

Everyone playing the slots would love to see Lucky 7-7-7 for BIG MONEY!\n\nWhile I was in Tampa, I decided to check out the Seminole Hard Rock Casino. The new South Parking Garage had just opened when I was here. I didn't stay at the Hotel, so this review is based on the Casino.\n\nOh man! The floor was very busy and MOBBED with a sea of old folks, with most slot machines in this big casino being played. I felt very young, like I was walking through a huge and glitzy senior citizen recreation center. I think to myself: As a current working class taxpayer, I really hope those folks are financially stable and not gambling away their Social Security and Medicare checks. (sigh)\n\nThe Casino also has poker tables, Texas Hold Em tournaments, bars, nightclub, restaurants, food court, and the Hard Rock Retail Store. I saw the food here was on the pricey side and it's good that I ate lunch before stopping here. I did some shopping at the Retail Store and picked up some cool Hard Rock pins and t-shirts. This store does not accept the Hard Rock Cafe All Access Card (points program), but they gave me a 10 percent discount for showing the card. \n\nOverall, it's not Vegas, but it's a decent place to play the slots in the Tampa Bay area with very easy highway access to/from I-4.",

I decided on the cold chicken caprese sandwich, lentil soup, and carrot cake to-go.  The order was ready very quickly, and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I opened the sandwich at home, intending to have \"just a bite\" then save the rest for dinner.   FAIL.  It was so flippin' good - fresh mozzarella, crisp greens & basil, toasted bread, thin sliced chicken, light drizzle of balsamic & olive oil - I ate half the sandwich right then.  Standing at the counter in my kitchen.  Hey - I'm sure some people some where eat dinner at 5:15 p.m., right?  The soup was good, and the carrot cake was outstanding.  Elke told me it had won some local awards, and I can definitely see why.  Sandwich gets an A+, so I can't wait to explore one of their dinners to-go next.  They also just started serving a Saturday night dinner inside the small restaurant part (6 or so tables), so that will be worth a try as well.",

I called to schedule an appointment but was told that the next available appointment for all the doctors would be in 6-8 weeks. I sat quietly as the lady repeated \"hello, hello, are you there?\" Instead of disconnecting, she asked my symptoms. She asked to place me on hold, then came back shortly & stated, \"Dr. Driver can see you next week.\" She asked that I please be on time, have the new patient packet completed, & bring insurance card with picture ID. I was so relieved & thankful. I arrived on time & the check-in process was quick. I waited five minutes before being called to the back. The Ultra-sound tech was knowledgable, thorough, & explained everything during my vaginal ultrasound. After I got dress, the nurse directed my husband & I to Dr. Driver's office where she did my consult. I have never met a doctor who displayed such empathy, concern, patience, & interest in my medical care. She reviewed my ultrasound & explained it to our understanding. She mentioned three options with surgery being the last. We moved to an examine room where she completed my pelvic exam. She was so kind & personable, my husband was even pleased. It has been two weeks since my appointment and I have had minimal pelvic pain with no interruption in work or exercise activities & for the first time no pain medication. Overall my experience was a five- the office and restrooms were clean, great staff all around, and an exceptional doctor.",

They have a Thursday special which is any large cheesesteak and a milkshake for $10.50.  I got a whiz with and a vanilla shake.\n\nCheesesteak-  They use really good meat here.  Its not all hacked up into pieces yet its not perfectly round slices of steak.  Kind of like a hybrid.  The meat was really good.  They load this thing up with a lot of onions too which I like.  The only thing I would change is the whiz.  It wasn't ooey and gooey...maybe it wasn't melted/heated enough???  Something was a little off with it.  The bread was good but a little too doughy.  Still a really good sandwich though.  If I ever go back, I'm going to order it with American cheese. (I read that American used to be the only way you could get a Chinks steak).\n\nMilkshake-  Delicious!  Plain vanilla.  I believe they use Turkey Hill Ice Cream which is phenomenal.  Some of the best ice cream you can get!  You could taste the vanilla bean and it was blended perfectly so you could suck it through the straw without straining too hard.  A great milkshake!\n\nService-  The service was amazing!  The waitress was super friendly and very \"easy on the eyes\".  She got my buddy drink refills without asking and delivered us more napkins when she saw we had cheese running down our face...very attentive!\n\nOut of 4 cheesesteaks on our trip, this would rank number 2 probably behind Steves Prince of Steaks.  I wouldn't recommend the whiz though.  Go with American and it would probably be a 5 star joint!  Total for 2 steaks, a Coke and a Milkshake was $22 and change.\n\n3 stars for the food and an extra one for the service!",

Their Pho is a bit salty and has more taste than Miss Saigon (its better).  But I would say that just about everything else on the menu, though cheaper, is not as good as it is at Miss Saigon.  Their rice paper rolls and bubble tea (powder based) were huge disappointments.  The rolls' pork tasted off and you have to make a special request for the peanut sauce. And my vermicelli dish was just mediocre.\n\nIt drives me crazy that they don't take credit cards because I never carry cash on me and its a pain in the butt to have to make a special trip to the next door atm at Kroger's.\n\nThe staff are not very friendly (except for this one guy) and definitely not attentive.  It took them 5 minutes to get a menu to us, another 5-7 minutes to take our order, another 15 minutes to get our drinks and another 10 minutes to bring out the orders.  SO SLOW!!!  And it took the guy forever to come back with the peanut sauce which I asked for for the rolls and for a fork and they were so absent minded that when we went to pay for the bill, she took the money then started cleaning tables before she gave us back our change!\n\nIts not fancy or anything, but the food is authentic, delicious and cheap.  Sometimes I wonder how clean the kitchen or backrooms are, but whatever...\n\nBottom line: food is mediocre/ pretty good but cheap, service is slow, staff is inattentive. Its too packed and noisy, which I think is the reason for the slow and inattentive service.  Attracts a lot of local Vietnamese and poor college students, but  for an extra 2 bucks, I'd rather go to Miss Saigon and have a close to perfect experience.",

Everything essentially is for sale as a single and there are no price tags, which can get quite annoying. But, you do get what you pay for and that is quite an outstanding selection such as Hair of the Dog, FiftyFifty Eclipse, Cigar City, Lost Abbey, odd Belgian stuff. I usually stop in here each trip to Philly and spend around $40-$50 on weird stuff I can't find anywhere else. You can go up to the counter and ask for a price check on anything you want, though that can be a little annoying. Don't come in here with a large group because only 4-5 people can fit in this place before it gets too cramped. There isn't someone on staff to answer beer questions, just ask the cashier essentially for anything. I usually get a nice response. Also, they have quite a bit of glassware for sale.

  "text": "I've long admired the Hotel Mazarin for its picturesque courtyard because I'm often in the adjoining wine bar, the exquisite Patrick's Bar Vin. I've spend many an idyllic afternoon/evening here. I've also booked several of my colleagues at the Mazarin when they've come to New Orleans and heard good things from them (as recently as January 2015).\n\nSo when looking to book a hotel for a work conference 10 people I was leading, Hotel Mazarin was at the top of my list. And when you realize that in other local hotels you're probably going to get that New Orleans jenk known as \"charm\"  for a similar price, I will absolutely recommend Hotel Mazarin for being immaculate (with one tiny exception in my bathroom, but I'm insane), amenities (almost Westin-quality beds, flatscreen TVs), and the restrained modern baroque decor (gold fixtures, marble floors). If you're a breakfast-lover, you cannot beat that deluxe complimentary breakfast (eggs & bacon, pastry, toast, cereal, juices). Seriously, I've stayed in New Orleans hotels with TVs straight out of the 90s, ancient (as in, not antique) beds, dated decor and questionable levels of cleanliness. I won't name names (search my reviews if you must). But Hotel Mazarin boasts higher standards. \n\nThat said, my colleagues and I had some issues during our stay last month that should be noted. \n\n-multiple reports of the front desk/reception staff being aloof and often downright surly (unacceptable and so not typical of the superb hospitality that is the custom of New Orleans. I'm honestly scratching my head over this one). One of my people was reprimanded for putting a room card/key in her wallet when she came down to report that her keys weren't working (she never put it in her wallet but even if she had?!) When she explained that she had done no such thing, the response from the desk was an eye roll. Another colleague called the desk to report that his room was noisy. With a week of late nights and early mornings ahead of him, he thought he could request a quieter room. He was informed that he was in a quiet room. That's it. No apologies or explanations. I can write more, but in the interest of space, I leave it at these two instances. \n\nHowever, all of the other hotel staff were great, from management to catering (special props to the lovely Mary who took care of our conference room. She is a gem!) Everyone in the breakfast room and in catering were ALL so lovely and friendly (everyone says good morning and the catering manager walked around talking to everyone, making sure they were having a great stay). \n\n-the showers are extremely tricky to work and some of us didn't have anything hotter than lukewarm water. This is horrible to deal with first thing in the morning on one of the coldest weeks in New Orleans. I live here and I know the city's water pressure leaves a lot to be desired, especially in old French Quarter buildings, but this isn't OK in a hotel. Apparently there was some trick to get it to work and I can't even tell you what that is, because it's really *that* tricky. There should be instructions posted, unless this was a fluke with half of my colleagues' rooms. \n\n-catering: although the food is good, it's extremely overpriced for what you get. You are not allowed to bring in outside food, so if you're using their conference room you're going to have to use these services. I know this is common practice in hotel conference rooms, so although I won't fault them for this, next year I'll try and find an alternative.\n\nRelated to this: when setting up my catering order, I specified that three of my group had dietary restrictions/extreme food allergies. For the very expensive muffaletta sandwiches, I thought they'd at least offer a GF bread option for one or two of them for my G/F colleague, but no. Second, I was told the king cake would be nut free and it was not. Suddenly I saw one of my colleagues leaving the room in the middle of a session and I later learned that he had to go up to his room and take an emergency Benadryl. If he hadn't, he likely would have needed to go to the hospital, for his nut allergy is that extreme. If I put on my request that at least one dessert should be nut free and the only other dessert item is pralines, the cooks should pay attention and not put nuts on the king cake. Pretty simple. Attention to detail is crucial. Again, when you're paying extremely high prices for catering, high expectations should be met.\n\nI would still recommend Hotel Mazarin thanks to its amazing location for visitors to our city, as well as the nice perks, including two comped drinks at the fabulous 21st Amendment Bar. Plus it's just nicer all around than other FQ hotels in this price range.",

  "text": "Sometimes you just get a craving for KFC. If you don't know what KFC is, you've been missing out on the good things in life. Korean fried chicken (aka. KFC) is Coco's Deep Fried Chicken specialty. It's their bread and butter, so don't come here expecting to see other Korean dishes on the menu. Although, technically they have homemade chicken and waffles so that could be considered something different.\n\nIt was my first time here so I thought it would be the perfect time to bring along a good buddy of mine who has never had Korean food before, EVER, WHAT! I've read some reviews on Coco's and I have no idea what some people were complaining about - sure, it's not the biggest restaurant out there but there is more than enough room to sit down and eat if you want to do that over take out. There must be about 8-9 tables total. Bonus that there were a lot of Koreans coming in to eat.\n\nWe decided to share a few things:\n- Set 1 ($29.99) - you get 10 pieces of KFC (half and half) plus your choice of any two drinks. We went with Cass Fresh (a Korean light beer) and Sapporo. I don't usually order drinks with food but beer and KFC seem to be a match made in heaven.  As for the fried chicken, it was spot on - crunchy, juicy and best of all, grease-less. It's tough to say which was better, the crispy deep fried chicken versus the sweet and hot sauce chicken, both were awesome! However, if I had a gun to my head, sweet and hot sauce chicken would win although it's in no way \"hot\".  But who cares when it is seriously that tasty!\n\n- Sweet potato fries ($5.99 for a large) - nice side dish to have with the chicken. The sweet potato fries were light, crispy but could have used some sort of sauce to go with them.\n\nAnyways, great spot to get yur KFC'ness in.  Check them out especially if you're doing some shopping at nearby South Edmonton Commons. Seriously, how is a Puma outlet there and no one told me?",

I can't speak for the service inside the restaurant, but I love sitting at the outside bar, and service has been spot on.\n\nIf you get there by 6 pm, there are a few happy hour specials; after 6 pm it's about $8 for a frozen strawberry margarita. We always order chips and salsa, and it comes out of the kitchen in minutes. Chips are fresh, and the salsa is decent, if uninspired.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is the grilled avocado halves topped with ahi tuna.  So surprising that a dish of this caliber is on the regular menu - but it is, and it is delicious. Served with a side of boring rice, this is still the item to eat when you go here.\n\nThat being said, I tried the Southern Tacos last night: chicken strips, slaw, corn salsa, and avocado ranch with a bbq drizzle, served in two tortillas - and they were awesome!  So, now I am torn as to what to get next visit, but it's a good problem to have.  Shout out to the bartender for recommending the Mexican corn bread as my side item-it was outstanding, and heads and tails better than the rice.\n\nHablo Taco has surprised me by being way better than I expected, and I look forward to trying other items on their menu.",

  "text": "Awesome hotel for events, especially if you're a bunch of dudes, or a couple in town to party. If you insist on staying on Bourbon Street (as we did for my bachelor party), this is a great option. You're in the middle of it all, with classically trashy joints across the street as a bonus (if you're facing Bourbon): Stiletto's, etc.\n\nThe rooms are very nice (we had a suite on the third floor). The lobby and much of the hotel are elegant, well appointed, and pleasant to the nose...a contrast to and escape from the madness of Bourbon Street for those times you're looking for a break. If you get a room with a balcony, you'll feel like the King (or Queen, as it were) of Mardi Gras.\n\nThere's a nice pool area on the third floor. It gets full so come early if you want a chair. Bar service seemed spotty but we didn't really partake (mostly BYOB and going out). Internet was equally spotty, but that's life in the hotel. The sports bar/grill attached to the hotel, \"Le Booze\" (YES), had good food and drink specials, and I was able to watch the Euro in the comfort of American soccer apathy. Kermit Ruffins threw a party in the suite directly below us on 4th of July, which was pretty amazing.\n\nOnly cons I can think of were the front desk check-in service, which was agonizingly slow (that could have been a quirk); and the level of noise. If you're in New Orleans to catch Zzzzs, either get an inner-facing room, or consider other options. If you're here to \"rage,\" on the other hand, you're in the right place.",

If you're into that, please don't tell me, because I will judge you. \n\nWhat? I'm just being honest. \n\nThat said, Lucy's is not a bad place to have lunch if you work downtown, and I've done that on more than one occasion. As a sort-of vegetarian-ish, the only thing on the menu that I've ever ordered (and therefore I assume that it's the only thing on the menu that I CAN order, but don't quote me on this because I couldn't tell you for sure without actually seeing a menu again) is the quesedilla, which I am just now realizing I have no idea how to spell. Nor does Firefox spellcheck, evidently, because the options are \"questionable\" through \"Queensland\" and not the word I'm looking for. But I digress.\n\nThe one thing that I order but can't spell from Lucy's is pretty good, not overly expensive, and you can also go here for late-ish night drunk food in addition to lunch, which I've also done. \n\nBesides food and creepy middle aged men hitting on inappropriately younger girls who are apparently into that, the best thing about Lucy's is to sit outside with a bucket of beer during happy hour, and count how many cars blow the stop sign at that intersection. Lucy's is on the corner of Girod and Tchoupitoulas, and it's a four way stop. However, for some reason the vast majority of people do not seem to realize this. It's definitely entertaining, and would actually make for a good drinking game now that I think about it. \n\nLucy's: Go for lunch, a bucket of beer and after-work entertainment, or to reassure yourself that you've \"still got it\" by being hit on or hitting on insecure or aging, collar-popping strangers. Whatever the equivalent of collar-popping would be for a middle aged gentleman. A dandy? (Kidding. That'd be a flamboyantly gay man from the 19th century. Obviously.)",

I don't know why I keep expecting to have a good experience at a Night Market. \n\nIn theory this sounds like a cool event. Well, apparently by the size of the crowd I'm not the only one that thinks this. I mean Night Market is fun if you like waiting in long lines with swarms of people. \n\nI didn't have much time to dedicate to South Street Night Market. My group probably got to South Street around 7:30 and had to leave for another event by 9/9:30. Rather than waiting in a beer line, we beelined to the state store. What a saving grace! We were able to buy \"juice boxes\" of wine and no one cared that we were drinking them in public on the street. \n\nEarlier in the day, I had printed out the map and vendor list and checked off about 20-25 places I would like to try. I had hoped to hit at least 2-3 places. Wishful thinking! I know I was being picky about my selections and expectations... I wanted to try a vendor that I've never had before and I didn't want to pick a restaurant that had a store front that I can visit any old day. We started at 9th and by the time we got to the corner of 6th, I knew I had to make a quick decision if I wanted to eat before leaving. Ka'Chi was in the right place at the right time. Luckily it was on my preselected list of vendors.\n\nI spent the majority of my time at Night Market waiting in that line. I was surrounded by friends and the other people on line were friendly so it could have been worse...it also could have been better. I'll review Ka'Chi separately but in short the food was good and I'm glad I waited BUT it really wasn't worth the wait.  Philadelphia has really stepped up its game with food trucks so its probably best to find them on an \"off\" day. Unfortunately, I was only able to eat at one vendor and not make a dent on my ambitious list. \n\nI think I'll be passing on the next Night Market in China Town... unless the allure sucks me back in.",

It is affiliated with the SkatePark of Tampa (SpoT) which has a shop next door and there are skateboard decks mounted on the walls of The Bricks as artwork and they play skate videos on the TVs above the bar; as I'm a skater myself, this is if anything just the icing on the cake for me. \n\nHowever, The Bricks' ardent support of skateboarding would not be enough to garner a five-star review alone, but thankfully it measures up in all other regards. The interior atmosphere is lively, inviting, and unique. The waitstaff and bartenders are on point, outgoing, friendly, and most importantly, quite prompt. As to the food, it's fairly simply fare but very tasty and very well-prepared. Tacos, a variety of Cuban sandwich variants, and some salads compose the lion's share of the menu. I had the Bird & Pig Cuban sandwich and also an order of chips and queso dip. The queso was especially good, which impressed me because too often things like queso are simply after-thoughts at bar-type restaurants. The sandwich itself was also very good. They have a full bar with a good selection of bourbons and ryes and also an expectedly good selection of beer, with an emphasis on Tampa's local brews. The wine list also looked better than you'd think for a casual bar atmosphere. Overall, it's clear they're investing in quality here. \n\nWhile their skateboarding association was enough to grab my attention to The Bricks, their stellar food and service are what really sets them apart. Ybor has a reputation for food being hit or miss, as is the case with many touristy areas, but The Bricks I found to be simply and casual yet truly impressive.",

  "text": "What a really fun and unique place! Dark, romantic decor and the booth seats come equipped with a radio play! A dramatic soap opera involving an affair between a nurse and s doctor.\n\nMy husband and I made a trip here last week for our first visit after one of his coworkers told him that we just needed to get ourselves one of their epic sundaes!\n\nOur waiter was crazy awesome! Very chill and very friendly and ready to blow us away with Fountain magic.\n\nMy husband started with the Dark and Sinister, but chocolate by itself isn't really his thing. So he ordered a second sundae - Three Coins in the Fountain - and he fell in love! If you want mint ice cream, this is definitely the way to go!\n\nI got Chocolate Brownie Cake in a Cup with Black Cherry ice cream instead of plain old vanilla. It was pretty big and pretty yummy. I can't say the brownie was anything special, but the Black Cherry ice cream and hot fudge made it all come together. Especially considering the huge chunks of actual cherries that I found bite after bite.\n\nI would say that this place has very similar sundaes to Crown Candy as far as serving size and quality are concerned. So if you want that kind of food, but want more of a dark romantic spot, this is the place for you!",

I guess when greatness is right in your backyard, you take it for granted.\nAnyway, when the pierogie mood struck me I knew today was the day! And boy, am I glad it was.  This little hole in the wall on what could be the smallest street in the neighborhood certainly doesn't look like much.  And they don't sell much either, but what they have is top notch.\nLets start with the pierogies.  They are pre-boiled so all you have to do is pan fry them and enjoy.  They have lots of fun flavors, including traditional ones like sauerkraut and not so traditional like cheesesteak.  My favorite that I tried today was farmer's cheese and potato.  However,stay tuned because I fully intend on trying them all in order to offer a more comprehensive review!\nNow on to the kielbasy.  What can I say? It is the best.  I tried the Cajun flavor and it was amazing.  We also ordered some bacon out of curiosity, and it was delicious.  It has ruined me for other bacon.\nPlease don't deprive yourself of the Polish delicacies offered here like I have! Learn from my mistake.",

  "text": "This is one of the more crowded establishments in the Funk Zone. The large bar is for tastings and there is another table that just sells glasses. This is one of the few tasting rooms that serves wine, bubbly and craft beer. Perhaps that is why it is so crowded. They offer an $11 wine and craft beer tasting if you are lucky enough to secure a place at the tasting bar.  At peak hours, it can be quite difficult to get a spot. We had to forego it all together and purchase libations by the glass because it was too crowded (about $10 each).\n\nThere is indoor and outdoor seating on the fine wood patio overlooking the sidewalk--certainly a choice spot for wine-soaked people watching, one of my favorite pastimes. I would recommend a glass of bubbly rose for a break from the more piquant selections at the neighboring wineries.",

When we looked up hotels in the area, we saw that this place was dog friendly. The dogs love this place because there is the lake across the parking lot and at the end of the lake, there's a small grassy area where my dogs could go potty. It is really hard to find grassy areas near a hotel, in general.\n\nUpon arrival, I instantly thought that this was a motel (which was what we expected for the price we were paying). To my surprise, when we got to the room, the inside was pretty nice. We even had little shampoo and lotion bottles (which a normal motel does not provide). \n\nIf you're looking for a cheap, dog-friendly place in Reno, this is your best bet!",

  "text": "My first visit to this brewery/ restaurant and I'm close to being a fan. We were here to celebrate a friend's birthday and it seemed like all 12 or so of us were satisfied with our food and experience. \n\nIt is a large and open space, both dining room and bar area, with some outside seating available as well. If I were to revisit( a good chance I will) I'd probably opt for bar area, especially during happy hour since those specials are not offered in dining room. Trish made the reservation for our group and ran into one glitch, the day of the event our 5:30 was changed to 5:00 by the restaurant. This was supposedly to accommodate another party at 7. We were not rushed out when that time approached but we also saw no sign of another party. \n\nI first perused the beer offerings, there seemed to be at least 10 on draught and some earlier offerings in cans. I selected their blueberry Hefeweizen and enjoyed the crisp flavor on this warm night, even though little to no berry taste came through. I would probably try something else next time. The food menu was possibly too large( in my opinion) with sandwich, pizza, apps and entrees offered. I was very hungry and 75% of the menu appealed to me, so I went to our excellent server Frank for his advice. He suggested a few dishes and I thought my beer choice would pair nicely with the pan roasted chicken entree. It proved to be good advice, a nicely cooked Frenched breast with the skin crispified served with what seemed to be local asparagus and mashed potatoes. The fowl was tender and juicy still, the pan sauce was lightly citrusy and herbed, it was good but could have been better if reduced and thickened. The mashed were ok, and probably the weakest link in the dish. I had an add on Caesar salad that was fair and overpriced( as add ons go) at $6. Trish went with his advice and ordered a shrimp and scallops special, she loved it and I have to admit, they are sourcing quality crustaceans.\n\nMost others in our group ordered burgers and we heard many good things. Surprisingly no one else tried any beer. We brought our own bday cake and were not charged a plating fee. Beer aficionados should consider joining their reward program, for a $15 one time fee you are entitled to a special glass that holds 22 oz for the price of a pint, along with other perks and incentives. Great place for gatherings, let's go with 3.75 ongoing research Yelps",

  "text": "I was happy to try this newer South Tampa shop which offers healthy options for meals or snacks. Enerjuicer features smoothies and acai bowls as well as snacks and some quick grab meals. I feel that they have a great selection of natural, healthy snacks and their smoothie selections are varied. \n\nThe fruit used is fresh and on display which I liked seeing. On the particular Monday afternoon I went there was a steady stream of customers and only one staff member working. This proved to be chaotic and challenging for the staff member and he managed as best he could. I realize that it is difficult to anticipate the ebb and flow of customers so I didn't mind that my Acai bowl came out slow, as I was not bound by time restraints. I felt that perhaps my bowl lacked an ingredient (probably due to it being busy) and had a bit too much granola for my liking. I took the bowl to go. As it was busy, I did not inquire about the contents of the acai bowl while I saw that it was being made. I witnessed him making smoothies and they looked wonderful. \n\nI look forward to trying Enerjuicer again and trying a smoothie concoction. I enjoy that this store is privately owned and j like supporting small businesses. Enerjuicer is definitely a closer and more welcomed option to trekking out to International Plaza to grab an acai bowl. Check it out!!",

Don't cry too hard about it, Chum Hums, because walking in, the ghost of Chumley's past seemed to be floating around.  Two weeks in, the setup is the same, the TVs are still in prime locations, and the local beer is all there in drafts, cans, and bottles.  \n\nHowever, there are changes in the several menus given to you, starting with the cocktail menu.  Our server boasted that the head bartender studied the art of old timey cocktails intensely, reading for six months straight before ever picking up a bottle.  It seems to be the new pride and joy of Village Tap Room.  I apologize for not being about to tell you more about them, because I'm a beer gal through and through.  I can say that I drank my 3 Floyd's Yum Yum with great content, knowing that it was one of many, many beers and ciders to choose from.\n\nAnd now my pride and joy: food hunting.  Most of you know that I make it my mission to find something tasty everywhere I go.  Smack dab in the center of the food menu was PUFFY TACOS in caps.  I tried to steer away from it--it could be a ploy--but your standard steakburger and tenderloin pub fare were not calling my name.  I chose shredded chipotle chicken as my protein (other options are chorizo, short rib, and pulled pork)  and mango salsa (I wasn't in a charred chipotle mood) to accompany it.  Two puffy tacos and $7 later, I feel confident about my decision of inflated fried flour tortillas stuffed with tender, spiced shredded chicken, sprinkled cheddar cheese, diced tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce, and mango salsa.  I like knowing that I have a solid go-to if someone wants to sit along the windows, people watch, and drink a pint.\n\nIt's not fancy, but Village Tap Room will fit in juuussst fine on the Broad Ripple strip.

  "text": "After a failed attempt at a much busier and more popular restaurant nearby, we found the Tavern to be the perfect spot to start off our Nashville trip. \n\nThere was no wait on a Friday night around 11pm. We were starving and impatient for something satisfyingly unhealthy and delicious. \n\nThe two of us definitely over-ordered. After we received our beer and cider orders, we placed our gargantuan order for two: the Tuscan style Tavern fries, which was HUGE, the chips and guacamole and the fish and chips. Obviously, the healthy factor was not an issue.\n\nEverything was tasty, just in huge portions. The Tavern fries were easy to munch on, although there was way too much. We probably could have ordered this alone. But I guess if an order of fries cost $6.50, I wouldn't expect just a small tin.\n\nThe guacamole was interesting. The goat cheese gave it a different flavor - but I liked it. There were so many chips but at the same time, there was a lot of guac. \n\nThe fish and chips wasn't bad, not mind blowing either. It was so greasy I could only take several bites before calling it quits. I love when my fried fish is super tender and juicy, but this was a bit much. When each bite you take the grease seems to flow out into your mouth, it may be too much.\n\nOverall, a delicious late night meal for ones who were unable to wait 45 minutes for a table at 9:30pm elsewhere... I'd definitely come back here for a couple beers and an order of their Tavern fries.",

The tap for that is on far left while the regular taps are on the right.

I pumped $80 worth of gas by that time I decided to find a Starbucks so I didn't go inside to experience the coffee bar or snack or beer lol. I wouldn't pull in here for just gas unless you are wanting to just kill some time.",

  "text": "We had lunch here today and loved it.  We were seated on the patio.  The space heater was on, but it was unnecessary on such a lovely day, so I asked if it could be turned off and the obliging young man did.  The menu is extensive and enticing.  There are several breakfast offerings and several more for lunch.  It was difficult to decide and when I did make a choice I thought wistfully of roads not taken.  Though many things tempted me, I went w/ the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque.  Alan ordered the tri tip slider, a house made cheddar biscuit, scrambled egg, arugula, jalapeño jam, served w/ country hash.  He ordered coffee and I ordered Lady Earl Grey tea.\n\nThe tea was served in a French press-type device.  We had whole milk on the side for both coffee and tea.  My tea cup was tall, graceful white porcelain.  The contents of the press just filled it.  The tea was very tasty.  When our dishes arrived they looked beautiful.  My sandwich contained tea smoked tomato, pulled mozzarella, brie,\nparmesan rubbed bread, mint cashew pesto.  It was luscious and generous enough to share bites w/ Alan and still be too much for me to finish.  The tomato bisque was dark and subtly smokey, w/ occasional chunks of tomato.  It was my childhood comfort food grown up and elegant.  Alan gave me a taste of his biscuit and it was delicious.  He loved the dish, although he found the finely diced potatoes disappointingly bland, lacking onions, peppers or anything else to give them interest.  His expectations may have been raised by the term 'hash'.  We were taken enough w/ our lunches that we discussed returning tomorrow to explore more of the menu  Perhaps we will.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't full when we arrived shortly before 11:30, but a steady stream of people arrived in groups of two and larger and soon both indoor and outdoor tables were close to full.  Our server told us the restaurant had been open a little more than a year and that it was quite popular.  We could certainly see why.",

  "text": "OH YES. Perfect place situated in the perfect place. Big and tasty and built to help your day at the beach (or your respite from the 101). I wandered over after surfing and, upon seeing a big line, took the advice of their friendly sign: Avoid The Line, and have some BBQ around the corner. Done. It all looked good, but I went with the Pulled Chicken Sandwich. Yes, chicken. And it totally worked. Nicely flavored with a bit of spice, the chicken meat sits upon the french roll. BBQ Sauce is good, though I'm glad I asked for it on the side. - cause that's just the kinda guy I am. \n\nIt comes with baked beans (which have a mustardy kick to 'em), as well as a mixed green salad. The sandwich itself could easily be split, it's that big. All this for $12.95. \n\nThe regular menu has salads and many more things that look good, plus some special beverages. Yes, you can have some adult bevs at the BBQ, but you'd be hard-pressed to get them to make you a delicious chocolate shake. To the regular menu for that.\n\nThere are so many places to sit. And there's a sand-area for the little ones to frolic. And on this Sunday, there was a Blues Band playing that seemed to know it's way around a Willie Dixon song or two. Totally good vibe for all ages.",

A year-long pass is only $159, which is a great deal if you have young kids preschool-age and younger, because there are a lot of exhibits geared toward those ages, and you'll really get your money's worth with repeat visits.\n\nExhibits change relatively frequently. One of the fun seasonal changes is during Christmas when they bring out the huge slide, and you can slide from the second level down to the first. Halloween time is pretty cool, too, because they have a haunted house!\n\nMost importantly, for all you exhausted parents out there: they serve Starbucks coffee in the cafe!

Definitely try it if you're a fan of a little pep! Most recently I tried the \"Wooly Mammoth\" which contained dark chocolate, cardamom, cinnamon and blackberry. It was very delicious! \n\nThey always have two menu posters on the wall noting the seasonal drinks, both teas and coffee which they are currently offering as well as one poster with their signature house favorites. They are all uber creative and it's really hard each time I've visited to choose just one of the options with quirky names such as \"Walking Dead\" & \"007\".\n\nLucky Goat of course offers all of the standard coffee shop beverages, but honestly, that's not why you're going to want to come here. Stepping out of your comfort zone a bit here would be my advice. I love the feeling of coming in knowing I can try something new each and every time I visit, but can always go back to an old favorite if I so choose. \n\nThere's a couch and some outdoor seating which I where you can usually find me. There are barstool seats by the side windows as well as two tops in the main room. There's also an upstairs which is a tad more spacious. There's games for adults and books for kiddos. \n\nI haven't tasted any of the food, but I do go a few blocks out of my way just for those unique drinks alone when in Fairmount/Brewery section of the city. I say try it! Oh, and they have almond and other non dairy milk varieties for the fellow veg-heads out there!",

Ban Cha Gio Tom Thit Nuong a lovely medley of Rice noodles, egg roll, grilled shrimp choice of pork or chicken served atop of lettuce, cucumbers, bean sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and served with a ddipping sauce (containing fish sauce I'm guessing).

Addiciting.\n\nThe 2 young men behind the counter were very sweet and lovely.  Although I'm more of a salty girl but when it comes to Vietnamese Coffee, I go all out.  Give me the 2 inches of condensed milk.   They go light here, maybe just looking out for you.\n\nYeah a bit pricey for a Vietnamese joint but I'd rather spend 10 bucks on a meal here then spend $7 at a drive thru.  Much better for you and go ahead and titilate your senses.  You can alwasy douse your pho with Siracha or Hoisin Sauce.",

  "text": "I'm really at a 3.75 stars here.....I've been here twice.  Once for a private baking event - for that I give it 5 stars.  And then I was here for a little coffee meeting....I give that like 2.5 - 3 stars.\n\nDuring the baking event, we had a group of about 12 and we were making babkas.  I wish I remembered the chef's name because he was fun and fantastic.  We learned how to roll out the dough, a little help from the fancy rolling machine and how to knead it properly, how to load it up with filling, how to cut and fold it and then they baked them for us.  They turned out lovely and delicious.  For storage purposes, they also told us how to package them so we could keep them for Thanksgiving 4-5 days later and mine kept perfectly!  My family enjoyed it!\n\nThe event itself was fun and doing the work and baking was fun.  We even got to help with the next day's croissants - rolling them...  They laid out some nice snacks and drinks for us after the baking was done so we could chat with one another until the baking was complete.  Very nice small baking event for a very reasonable price.  That was 5 stars!\n\nOn a separate occasion I met a friend for coffee and had a breakfast sandwich.  I was happy that they could accommodate my need for non-dairy in my special drink and the croissant with egg and bacon was nice...however, I could not taste the caramel in my caramel macchiato...I went up to request more and she loaded it in there and I took a seat and again, still could not taste the caramel.  The coffee did not taste nice.  I was VERY sad about that.  My croissant was very large (update to include that this large croissant was not a negative thing!  I liked that it was large), the egg was decent and bacon was thick...but a lot of fat.  I peeled off a lot of fat from the 2 slices and left it on the side of the plate.  You're going to get fat on bacon, yes, but it was kind of a lot of fat...  And the flavor was plain.\n\nI think this place is a bit over-rated, as much as I enjoyed the baking class...but the baked goods are very good.  It's just not a great place for coffee or to eat here unless you are having one of their baked goods.",

  "text": "From wallpapered walls on which spotlit photos of homes are hung, to plain brick facade, to large blown-up portraits of Joplin, Hendrix, and other classic rockers, Twisted Tail's lower level is somewhat confusing. This confusion extends to the kitchen, wherein the recent chef switcheroo of Michael Stevenson for Leo Forneas has led to the restaurant's refocus from the pure Southern bourbon and blues motif that previously and not very successfully defined them since opening a few years ago.\n\nOn a normal day, this would be enough in itself, but I chose to visit during Mother's Day, pretty much the worst day for dining out, especially when you're part of a party of eight. So the service, while not bad, per se, gets a pass. What doesn't get a pass is the prix fixe menu from which we were forced to order. The menu consisted of literally every item of their normal brunch menu, plus a couple of desserts, for a significantly higher price than normal. So say you wanted to order the salad and buttermilk chicken sandwich - $15 on a normal Sunday. $35 on Mother's Day. But you got a choice of beignets or panna cotta for dessert, so I'm sure that warranted the extra markup. Needless to say, I made it a priority to choose the absolute most expensive things on their normal brunch menu.\n\nAnother problem with just throwing your entire menu onto a prix fixe is portion sizes. My tuna tartare was simply mixed with the occasional sliced cornichon and served alongside a few potato chips, but it was fresh and a good size to prime to palate for the rest of the meal. Some of my fellow diners got the pigs in a blanket, which were nearly a main course in themselves. After plowing through a few of them, multiple people remarked at how full they were getting, and the main course hadn't even arrived yet. \n\nThe Maryland Crab cake eggs benedict isn't what you'd expect to find in a Southern-slanted restaurant, but I'm glad it's here, because the crab cakes were almost all crab, and went really well with the eggs (poached well for me, though others weren't so lucky), mustard hollandaise, and English muffin. Serving them alongside french fries seemed like they just didn't want to take the time to prepare an additional starch, and I didn't want to take the time to eat the underwhelming slices of potato. \n\nFried dough is an easy crowd pleaser, and the beignets hit the spot, even if they were still a little doughy. The gluten-free diner amongst us described her panna cotta as \"interesting,\" and not in a good way, though she seemed unfamiliar with the dish. \n\nTo be honest, the combination of food and company provided an overall positive experience at Twisted Tail, though there were enough missteps to not make it a priority to return. Regardless of the good service from our server, and the great service from the managers in seating us in what must have been a hellish time for them, the food still needs a little bit of refinement.",

The braised pork shoulder was not very fatty but nicely rendered with nuances of smoke and salt. It was warmed under a broiler and topped with a barbecue-like sauce on it. There were not any sea beans but some sort of pickled cabbage. The raw bean sprouts were a nice pho-like touch. \n\nOverall, the service was friendly and great.

But, it wasn't so fast. It could have been because everyone just got out of the Saints vs. Cubs game. When friends and I arrived, the line was almost at the door. Ordering was slow going. There was only 1 cashier taking food orders. The other cashier, closest to the entrance, was strictly for drinks. \n\nAfter waiting a good 15 minutes, it was my time to order. I got the 2 piece mix w/ biscuit and side. But, side choices are limited to only fries, jambalaya and red beans & rice. I was told that they didn't have mashed potatoes, even though it was on the menu. It could have been that they just run out. The impatient cashier just made it sound like they no longer served it. I ended up picking the jambalaya.\n\nBesides the 2 cashiers, there was one person to plate the food and another person to deliver the meals. I'm also going to assume that there's one person in the back doing all the cooking. Quite frankly, it's not enough people to deal with such a big rush. \n\nTables were dirty and it took a while for someone to clean them off. We pretty much cleaned our own, as we waited for our food to arrive. Surprisingly, the our food order didn't take that long. So, that was a plus. The chicken was pretty good and juicy. My side of jambalaya was merely okay. Biscuit was good, but I've had better. \n\nWillie's would be an A-OK stop, if you want fried chicken. Just not when a football game has been let out or when it's a meal rush.",

  "text": "Absolutely beyond the 'woohoo! as good as it gets!' 5 Yelp stars!  \n\nZeppoli blew me away with every course from start to finish!    Hands down - BEST MEAL OF THE YEAR 2016!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is small/intimate and no big deal of a decor; however, I loved all of their fresh plants and black & white photos of Italy.  \n\nBread - two varieties of each (3) with an incredible seasoned olive oil (comes w/ three olives).  \n\nWe shared two appetizers - a shrimp and bean one (three large and totally taste galore shrimp!) and an incredible pesto pasta one.  The sauces on each were insanely delcious!  Even the pasta itself was devine & that's my 'area of expertise!'  \n\nI had a hard time choosing from the (small) menu b/c I do not eat (nor have ever tried, nor want to) rabbit, wasn't in the mood for chicken, was still teetering about the branzino and wasn't interested in the other menu items for differing reasons.\n\nI did decide on the 'Fisherman's Stew.'  GREAT choice!!!!  It was absolutely AMAZING.  Clams, mussels, swordfish, shrimp and calamari in a broth that I made sure to get every possible lick of w/ my large spoon!  It also boasted really good cous cous (a touch more would've been nice).  Everything was cooked perfectly.  I cannot say enough about the broth!!   W  O  W  !!!!\n\nVince had a wonderfully delcious 'slab' of swordfish accompanied by an orange fennel salad (not up my alley) that he enjoyed tremendously.\n\nWe finished w/ a fabulously delectible dessert - pistachio and walnut semifreddo.  I have NEVER had a dessert such as this one before.  Every bite was absolutely luscious!  \n\nThey even put a sparkler atop for Vince's birthday!\n\nI did not want this night or meal to end!  \n\nI will & would reccommend 'Zeppoli' to everyone, especially those who are looking to impess someone for a special occasion. \n\n TO DIE FOR!",

It certainly wasn't bad, but it didn't blow me away. Perhaps I need to try something other than a plain croissant, but at the time what I really wanted was something lunch-like, and everything they had (as far as I could tell) had meat in it. Something vegetarian along the lines of their turkey sandwich and/or ham and cheese croissant (perhaps a spinach and feta croissant) would've been awesome. Maybe I needed to ask. \n\nIn any event, it's a bustling little place and people obviously love it. But it seemed that you kind of needed to know what to order, since there wasn't a ton on display and there wasn't a list or anything.

My friend Brett ordered the Chocolate coconut cake, and my friend Frank got the Chocolate Mousse cake. The frosting tasted like nail polish! Yes! Nail polish!  When we told our waitress, she told her manager about it, but he didn't try to fix the problem. We told the waitress to taste the frosting, and she even agreed that both cakes tasted like nail polish. I'm guessing that whoever baked the cake probably just had their nails done, and got some of the nail solution in the frosting. Pretty gross.",

The day before Thanksgiving, that flurry of femininity kept the registers cha-chinging for hours on end. The fact that employee discounts are extended to card-bearing, photo-I.D. producing friends and family this week also had something to do with it, I suspect.\n\nThis particular Anthro is housed in a historic Rittenhouse Square mansion and stuffed with women's apparel, accessories, hilariously spendy shoes, housewares, a lifetime's supply of scented candles and the famous Basement Sale Room.

I don't think they have specialty cocktails to the best of my knowledge.\n\nI love sitting up against to the booth seating to the left and just observing the people ebbing and flowing from Pravda - usually younger hipster kids, pseudo-goth people, and sometimes older people set up shop here with their books and laptops (there are classic books available on the shelves here, should you feel a moment of bold literacy). \n\nThere's free wifi here, which is good as my phone signal usually blows in here.  \n\nI would say that it's never gotten REALLY crowded in here, so it's a perfect pre-gaming or post-gaming site.",

Fortunately if you are planning on dining alone or in a pair, it is easily to find seats at the bar where they have full menu service. \n\nThe bar is a little understaffed, and with all of the drink orders coming in from the tables, there is a high possibility that you will overlooked. Still, I commend the bartender who was serving me for being as attentive as he possibly could (which was very little attention). \n\nI ordered the seafood gumbo and the braised pork belly from the appetizer menu. The gumbo was good, but not particularly outstanding. Compared to the other gumbos I'd had the past few days, I'd say that it would rank about average. The braised pork belly on the other hand was phenomenal. The smokiness and sweetness (from the glazed pears) of the pork went very well together. The lightly dressed baby spinach salad was a perfect complement to the appetizer. Very well done! I only wish I had a bigger piece of pork belly!!\n\nI'd definitely recommend this restaurant for out-of-town visitors and for anyone you really, really want to impress. :)",

Got there early, 6-ish, to try to beat the inevitable lines.  The traffic heading down Pine St was a disaster (whether due to South Street being closed, the Eagles game, or maybe it always is at rush hour).  I tried to park in that big indoor lot on Lombard between 2nd & 3rd, but it was full (did find one of the last spaces across the street, TG).\n\nGetting to Night Market early is definitely a good plan, since after an hour the lines start to get really long for the best trucks.  But went with the flow and had a great time anyway.\n\nAward for longest lines (too long to wait in): A tie between Cheu Noodle Bar (presumably for those killer wings), and the Surf and Turf Truck (lobster rolls).\n\nHighlight of the night: Chatting with Marc Vetri as he sweated for his money at the Alla Spina tent (see photo).  Pretty good Sangria, Marc!\n\nAlso tried:\n\nFOO TRUCK'S roast pork bahn mi crostini--perhaps the best thing all evening\n\nFREECON FARMS' Crabby Granny cider--a nice big refreshing glass\n\nLITTLE BABY'S ICE CREAM for peanut butter, maple, tarragon ice cream--Yum!\n\nPOI DOG SNACK SHOP for an authentic Hawaiian spam musubi (why Haiwaii consumes 80% of the world's SPAM supply!)\n\nhttp://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2008/04/tutorial-how-to-make-hawaiian-spam-musubi-sushi.html\n\nSTREET FOOD PHILLY...I can't remember what\n\nSUPPER'S SCRATCH BISCUITS for a roast pork and pineapple salsa biscuit sandwith--great biscuit, but large and dry due to too little filling\n\nTACO MONDO's Thai chicken taco--excellent\n\nXOCHITL's margarita--pretty decent\n\nAbout 1 1/2 hours to walk from Front to 9th street.  Definitely one of the \"must dos\" of the Philly food scene, but get a couple of beers to keep you company while you wait in line.\n\nIf you want to see what the vibe is like, the Inky's Dawn Fallik has a good video here:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gRp2a5g6ok",

  "text": "My wife and I enjoyed good food and service in this quirky new pizza place.  I really liked the breadsticks and the Sidekicks Supreme pizza.  \n\n  I was surprised to find street parking just around the corner at lunchtime on Saturday.  (Free is good!)  Anyway, we walked past two other restaurants/bars in the Action Bowl building and saw the sign/stand in front of the entrance.  (It still says Shelby in bold letters over the doorway.)  As we entered, we saw the sign to seat ourselves and our waitress noticed us and greeted us, echoing the sign to sit wherever we liked.  We chose a window seat so that we could see the fountains and people watch.\n\n  Our waitress was over promptly and maintained good service throughout our lunch.  She kept busy doing prep work while not attending us and managed to deal with carryout orders as well.  I noticed another sign that they now have Uber Delivery available.\n\n  While waiting for our food, I noticed they have pictures of sidekicks all around the restaurant. I recognized many of them. There is also a pinball game to help pass time.  A long bar is available for patrons to order one of the bottled beers or local brews (I think there were 8 on tap.)\n\n Our breadsticks came out first.  We ordered 4 sticks which came with two choices of dipping sauces.  (Breadsticks can be ordered in 2, 4, or 6 and there are six varieties of dipping sauces to choose from).  We ordered the marinara and the nacho cheese.  The nacho cheese comes with red peppers diced into the sauce.  Both sauces were tasty and the sticks were flatter than I have had elsewhere, but that was a good thing.  They seemed to have a little more crispness than most I've tried.\n\n  Our pizza arrived and was very good!  This thin crust pie had plenty of mozzarella that stretched when I lifted each slice. The green peppers were cut large, but were cooked thoroughly, so that was a nice surprise.  Plenty of flavor.  The crust itself was crisp around the rim, but just a little soggy in the center which made it hard to pick up at first.  There was just a little grease from the pepperoni, but just enough to lick my fingers, not make a mess.  Overall, I would order this again and since there were 8 slices, I had to get a box for my leftovers.\n\n  I haven't tried their salads or sandwiches yet, but based upon my experience, I would gladly bring friends here to eat and maybe grab a brew.\n\nReview #341\n\np.s.  This is the third restaurant I have been to in this location.  It is quirky here on its own, but seeing the same basic layout with new decor just adds to the oddness of the experience.",

For $50.00 on the weekends you get a full 6 course experience complete with dancing (and its mandatory). They offer affordable wine and we settled into a lengthy dinner experience. \nHighlights: \nThe focaccia with olive oil was the first item I tried and one of my favorites. It was perfect! I also loved the scallops, rigatoni with butternut squash, sage, and brown butter. I couldn't stop eating it! The herb crusted pork loin was a home run as well, and the cappuccinos with our donuts didn't disappoint either. I wasn't such a fan of the short rib pasta or the risotto cakes (very bland), but the good thing about this experience is it's family style, and you get to try a bit of everything and if you aren't a fan of one item, another heaping dish is right behind it for you try! \nThe staff was absolutely incredible and fun, and you can tell that this isn't just a restaurant, it's a passion for them! I appreciated all the work they put into making our meal an experience.",

I know this going in...so...aside from that what's not to enjoy about spending the day relaxing poolside with a gorgeous view to the Arizona desert and the loveliest most polite staff in the Tucson city limits? Turquesa is the poolside restaurant at the resort. The menu covers your standard Latin fare from tacos to Nachos, salads, guacamole, ceviche and more. After two days at the pool we determined our favorite item were the Nachos. A GIANT bowl that's easily big enough for 6 people is about $11 with all the fixings- cheese, jalapeños, nachos, a TON of cheese, and your choice of chicken or meat. These nachos are legit. Sure, the green chile tacos were tasty and the grape fruit and avocado salad was certainly crispy and refreshing, but a giant bowl of nachos with a buckets of Tecate light can't be beat. Ultimately, the staff at Turquesa makes it worth while. The team here is all smiles and seriously at your service. Mac and Joel are two in particular that were so wonderful to our group. They remembered us by name the next day too! And our orders. I love staying at the Ritz for a staycation and the team at Turquesa makes the poolside experience totally fabulous.",

It is tucked in the middle of some well-traveled tightly-packed Philly streets, but we had no problem finding an open spot half a block away. breakfast is their focus, and servers are constantly walking by asking if you'd like a coffee refill. Be sure to check the chalkboards for the specials and you will probably eschew the menu altogether. They have many breakfast staples, but some choices you don't often see, like toad-in-the-hole, but I went with the juevos rancheros since I was in the mood for avocado. Everything about the dish was fantastic, from the crispy tortillas with the beans and salsa to the perfectly-runny eggs. I was a little dismayed to see that the avocado was served on the side of the plate instead of layered into the dish, but it did not make it hard to eat. This is a wonderful gem and we have a new spot to stop at as we go up and down the east coast.",

Sizable crowd. Tons of good looking guys to check out. Tons of hot girls nursing drinks and playing coy with aforementioned guys. I liked how the unspoken dresscode was more relaxed than other clubs I've been to. I still remember the time I was seriously one out of three girls wearing jeans to a club in Hollywod; however, in Tonic there were plenty of girls just in jeans and cute tops. I would've felt perfectly comfortable in my flat sandals if it wasn't for the fact that it meant I didn't even come up to the shoulders of most of the guys there. I'll definitely come back with my friend to check this place out again. Hopefully in heels.",

The food was excellent, and the portions very generous. \n\nThey were pretty busy when we walked in on a Thursday night, but we were able to get a window seat right away. It was a little chilly sitting next to the window, even though it was closed, but the hot tea warmed us up. \n\nWe started with the roti, which I could not stop eating. It was so good! Next we had the mango chicken and the pad thai. The mango chicken in particular was delicious. I would definitely order it again, along with the roti. The chicken was tender and all white-meat, and sauce had a nice kick. \n\nWe were laughing about all the notes on the menu next to a bunch of items requesting that you ask your server about the dish before ordering it. It did make us avoid those dishes though. If we go back to Penang, which we definitely would if we lived in Philly, we might want to order one of the dishes with the warning, if nothing else, out of curiosity. \n\nA few nights later we tried Banana Leaf, and although we enjoyed our meal there, too, we liked the food and atmosphere a little better at Penang.

Pad See Yew: Made with Chinese broccoli and plenty of egg in a savory sauce.  Very very good.\n2. Red Penang Curry: Spicy and creamy with fresh veggies, plenty of beef, and the best curry broth.\n3. Ginger stir-fried chicken: Amazingly savory and cooked with tender pieces of chicken breast.  Great if you are looking for a non-spicy dish.\n4. Crispy duck fried rice: The duck definitely rivals Morimoto's with tender meat and a crispy skin.  The rice is delicious with plenty of veggies and egg.  \n5.  Siam Salmon: Great tangy sauce with a delicious fillet accompanied by crispy, fried crab.  Love!\n6. Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls: Filled with actual whole jumbo shrimp and served with a delicious dip.  This is unique to Jasmine Rice so highly recommend trying.\n7. Papaya Salad: Good but not differentiated from the other versions.\n8. Chicken Lettuce Wraps: A great spicy version of a classic.  It's a Gar pao accompanied with large Romaine leaves.  I would recommend getting a bowl of sticky rice and having the chicken with the rice.\n\nService is very attentive but the seating is pretty cramped so definitely book reservations for a party of more than 2.

Your serving quality wines, and everyone knows Woodbridge does not fall into that category.  \nThe staff is friendly and provides good service, but while we were there they seemed to be over staffed and falling over each other. \nThey've decorated well for the holidays and I love the heated front patio and the fire pit in the back patio. \n I'll revisit and I am sure they'll pull it together so I can upgrade my # of stars.",

We stopped for food at: Tampa Bay Brewery (wings), Pizza Place for a cheese slice, a restaurant for 1/2 a Cuban sandwich, a restaurant for black beans and rice, cigar shop for a guava empanada and cafe con leche.  The tour took 3 hours.  We met at Ybor Centre and started on time.  There is about a mile of walking.  You learn about the cigar industry and social life of the locals back in the late 1800's and early 1900's. It was an interesting tour and paired with good food.  I definitely recommend it.",

  "text": "The Tiki gods have answered my prayers! New Orleans now has a fabulous Tiki bar, with just the right dark Polynesian atmosphere that's straight outta Trader Vics circa 1965. My mom would always regale me with stories about her times at Hawaii Kai in Manhattan in the 60s. As a child, I'd cherish our annual trips to Mai Kai in Fort Lauderdale (which still exists, apparently!) Fun fact: About 5 years ago, I was a featured bartender in Inked Magazine where I talk about making Tiki drinks (you can see the photo in my profile), as I worked in a Tiki bar in NYC (Waikiki Wally's RIP).\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a lover all things Tiki, though I have to admit, I hate loathe and despise sweet drinks for obvious reasons, but hell, it's a Yelp review so I'll just come out and say it: usually sweet drinks mask cheap liquor. Usually sweet drinks are meant for people who aren't drinkers and can't stand the taste of alcohol. And last but certainly not least, sweet drinks mean for inevitable hangover. I pride myself on being a veteran drinker and at most, get one hangover a year. In fact, my year anniversary of my last hangover is coming up. July 4. \n\nThe fabulous thing is, Tiki Tolteca offers up *craft* Tiki drinks. Yes, you're reading that correctly. Look at my menu photos that detail the ingredients! They even offer up little stories with each drink. Their cocktails don't only feature rum, but such lovely spirits as my beloved Mezcal, and my much less beloved caçaca. I settled on a Hemingway Daiquiri, which is frozen and perfect because it's not a fruit daiquiri, so not filled with artificial nonsense, just lime, rum, & maraschino liqueur. And potent, seeing as I was feeling a nice buzz after two.\n\nThey also have a menu feature small plates with a tropical flavor. DO NOT PASS UP THAT CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE DESSERT. The Tiki gods command it, too. Seriously. It really is the stuff of the gods. Chocolate, coconut, banana sauce... 'scuse me while I talk in tongues. I look forward to going back and trying the sweet corn tamales (vegetarian!). No crab rangoons, though, thankfully (created at Don the Beachcomber and now for some reason is expected on any given Chinese restaurant menu for some perplexing reason).\n\nOh!! Be sure and order a High Life, if you're so inclined, so you can get the full bottle service experience. This is no joke. They serve it in Champagne glasses and ice your bottle. Luckily my drinking partners indulged so I didn't have to.\n\nMore fun trivia. You may see in my profile that my current (and forever) crush is Howard Hughes. Apparently there's a tale of him drinking one too many zombies at Don the Beachcomber and then killed a pedestrian with his car. Bad Howie!! I hope it's not true. But yeah, beware the ENTIRE ZOMBIE MENU (seriously. TIki Tolteca has an entire zombie menu!!)\n\nWhat's next Tiki Tolteca? Maybe scheduled thunderstorms over a lagoon a la San Francisco's Tonga Room?",

  "text": "I'm glad folks from Philly and the surrounding area are calling this place out for being overpriced and over-hyped so that I don't have to look too much like a regional hater, but Federal Donuts continued the trend of our last visit of places that failed to meet our expectations. Luckily none of the food was bad (the service however was terrible), but really nothing stood out as good enough to justify the markup their charging for the experience. We had tried to go to the Pennsport location first, but they closed just as we arrived (3PM closing time seems odd, no?), so we wound up here, and maybe that location is better or something.\n\nDue to their proximity, we wind up with a lot of Philly natives down in DC, and as a result there's this constant bickering about cities, so when 2 different fried chicken and donut places opened up in DC a few years ago there were of course cries of \"idea theft\" from Federal Donut lovers. Well, I can say with a good bit of certainty, that not being from either town (although I do now reside in DC), both operations in DC (Astro and GBD) are a far superior product than what we had from this Federal Donuts. The creative donuts are more creative, and made better, and the chicken is fried better. Whether or not they \"stole\" the idea of combining 2 of the country's most beloved items is absurd, I'm sure many of us did that in our dorm rooms, but ultimately all that matters is the end product, and Federal Donuts falls short in that regard for me.\n\nAs for the donuts, we tried the blackberry walnut, marshmallow squared, and chocolate glazed, along with one of their \"fresh\" made basic donuts, since Suzy isn't really into the fancy flavors. The cake consistency of each of the fancy donuts was well done, but they all just tasted kind of plain. I believe they just use the same cake batter for almost everything and then simply dip it in whatever the flavor is, rather than baking the flavor into the mix. This results in somewhat of a Dunkin Donuts feel to the product, at a much higher premium. The guy doing the fresh donuts was having a good bit of trouble actually making a circle, so Suzy had to keep going back repeatedly to check for her donut (we were literally the only non-employees in the building at the time). Coupled with the fact that he seemed to have a good bit of difficulty answering any questions she had about the menu items, this left us even less impressed with the staff than the actual food.\n\nThe fried chicken was somewhat better than the donuts in terms of execution. We chose one dry option and one glazed, and I'm fairly certain I wound up consuming the lion's share of it all (no surprise to anyone who knows my background). The za'atar seasoning was nice and heavy on the chicken, adding lots of flavor, but the chicken itself was a bit too dry. The chili garlic was somewhat excessive, I would prefer to not need an entire roll of paper towels to make through an order of 6 wings. It was hard to get a feel for the chicken itself when you're having to scrape off giant chunks of sauce. It just felt sloppily composed, or just lazily executed. It was nice they include a basic donut with each order, to give you something to balance the flavors, but would have been even nicer if it mentioned that on the menu so that we could have adjusted our donut order accordingly.\n\nI don't recall exactly what our total for a few donuts and a dozen wings (and maybe a soda and a water) was, but it was somewhere between $30-40, which is fairly ridiculous considering the simple approach to everything. If they were huge yeast donuts (like at Doughnut Plant, VooDoo, or GBD) then maybe I could understand, but these donuts lack that level of effort. To top it off their register has one of those annoying \"tip screens\" that you have to go through before signing for your credit card purchase. You basically have the same job as someone at KFC, and expect a tip for it, on top of your already overpriced product. Get out of here with that nonsense.",

  "text": "We picked this place for an early dinner based on the number of 5-star reviews from friends.  Definitely a good choice!\n\nFunny thing is that Aimee K wrote about how it is a heavy meal unless you have a salad and a flat bread.  What's funny about this is that I didn't read her review until after I had ordered and usually like a heavy meal...but had ordered a salad and a flatbread.  \n\nThe wedge salad was fantastic!  Beautifully crisp lettuce, generous amounts of Gorgonzola, perfectly ripe tomatoes and a creamy dressing that really pulled it all together.  The waiter and the kitchen both accommodated my request to go easy on the pepperoni for the pepperoni, sausage and ricotta flatbread.  I really enjoyed the spiciness of the sausage where pieces of fennel were evident (my favorite aspect of Chicago-style Italian sausage) and not quite enough ricotta.  Very crispy crust and an all-around great flatbread.\n\nThe wife had something loaded with horrible mushrooms that she thoroughly enjoyed and I didn't try.   \n\nShe opted for the bread pudding for dessert and I managed to pinch exactly two bites.  Really delicious and I enjoyed the addition of butterscotch to the dish.  It just seemed to add another layer of flavor.\n\nWe will have to go there again when I am up for a heavy meal.

WTF!?!\n\nSeriously, they provide the least reliable Internet service I have ever had...and that includes the days of dial-up AOL.  Their signal is unreliable, their equipment is barely compatible with anything decent that is available in the marketplace and they have this horrible habit of sending out \"partner\" technicians who are very quick to escalate a ticket and haul ass instead of fixing the problems.  Another game they play is the \"that's not our fault...call your equipment manufacturer\" game.\n\nI had cable internet in the last city where we lived.  I am perfectly comfortable stating that I spent more time on the phone with Charter tech support in the first 6 months at this address than I did in the previous 10 years combined.  The situation has not improved over the subsequent 18 months and now they think their service is good enough to raise my rates?!?\n\nI've spent so much time on the phone with their tech support people that I literally know several of their troubleshooting scripts by heart and routinely tell them to skip ahead to the step where they do X from their end so that my equipment will begin functioning again.  I have their tech support number on speed dial too.\n\nWhen it works, the speed is impressive.  Sadly, there are enough issues that I will rip their equipment out of my house and throw it in the street as soon as a competitive offering comes around that is within 25% of their pricing.  Fiber companies, any takers???\n\nAll of this begs the obvious question: why oh why can we not write zero-star reviews?",

It was ok.\n*I ordered vindaloo and it really wasn't a vindaloo sauce. I'm guessing they took their standard \"curry\" sauce, threw some potatoes in and called it vindaloo. \n\nNope:\n*Tiny portions. They sent \"maybe\" a cup of rice and there were only 6-8 chunks of chicken in my container of \"vindaloo\" sauce.\n*Samosas are super bland and boring. Dipping in the curry/vindaloo sauce helped somewhat.\n*The delivery guy didn't bring any utensils or a plate despite my note on the order that it was going to a hotel. Hey guys, I'm at a HOTEL - meaning I don't have a kitchen. I wasn't thrilled at having to schlep down to the lobby in my jammies to beg for a plate and fork.\n\nOverall - \"meh\" sums it up.

But the foodie I am, had to convinced the wife we can go to the Rib Festival and have a spa day in Reno.  Being that I'm lazy I'm combining my review for Toscana Spa and the Tuscany Suite we stayed in at the Peppermill.\n\nToscana Spa:  5 stars. \nI thought the Rib Fest would be the highlight of our trip but it turned out that the Peppermill has an amazing spa.  When first walking in I was given a tour of the three floor spa followed by a locker, robe, and sandals.  On the bottom floor there are refreshments, toiletries for shaving etc, a sauna, steam room, and private showers. The second floor has a nice relaxation room with ipods next to lazyboy style seats also with refreshments.  The third floor is co-ed where couples can sit and have lunch. There is a pool, jacuzzi, and a lot of lounge chairs to relax.  At 1pm we had an 80 minute couples massage scheduled.  My wife said the massage was really good and professional.  Apparently it was good because 30 minutes into the massage my wife said I was snoring the rest of the massage so I don't recall anything that happened. Single or married he Toscana Spa has everything you could possibly want in a relaxing afternoon.  It doesn't even involve food but I still viewed it as 5 star worthy.  Wow.\n\nPeppermill's Tuscany Suite:  4 Stars.\nThese newly renovated suites were finished back in 2010.  The ambience and decor is all based on Italy.  Scenic paintings of Northern and Southern Italy.  Our suite was large, it had a king sized bed, chairs, furniture, and a huge window with a view of the mountains. The bathroom had a 25 inch flat screen, vanity area, hot tub, shower, double sinks, and a private area for the toilet.  The room is very comfortable and is comparable with the rooms I stay at in Las Vegas.  \n\nOverall it was a really nice first anniversary on a budget.  Reno isn't the most exciting place in the world but a nice weekend destination for Californians looking for a relaxing weekend at a nice hotel with an excellent spa.",

  "text": "Both the Gumbo and Oyster Po boy were top notch.\n\nThe gumbo was deeply aromatic and earthy. The base soup was thick and goopy. There were a ton of complex flavors going on. The shredded pork was long, tender, and executed to the proper temperature. The dish balanced its meatiness with light acid. Excellent gumbo.\n\nThe Oyster Po boy had a generous filling of fried oyster and standard lettuce tomato mayo. \n\nThe oysters were fried in a pleasant crunchy breading with proper seasoning. Condiments were fresh and the mayo seemed to carry some Cajun spice to it. Nice touch.\n\nOnly critique would be the bread. Its a standard Italian sandwich roll. That obscures the sandwich filling just a bit much with little flavor benefit.\n\nOverall an excellent dining experience. Service was fast and pleasant. I'll definitely be back!",

  "text": "I agree with my real-life friend pre-Yelp and pre-FB about this place. And I just looked over the other reviews. There is ABSOLUTELY something rotten in the state of Denmark here. The slew of 1 star reviews are by people who have from 1 to 3 reviews total. One was a flat out fake and one by a Montecito resident I personally know who is quite possibly mentally ill/delusional.Sadly, he got 25 notes on this review as he's a writer and funny. \n\nI forgot about it for awhile, living on the border of Montecito and SB and staying mostly on Coast Village Road. \n\nI had a great brunch here last year, trying the butternut squash pizza with the crinkly sage (flash fried I think), goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil . Sublime! \n\nThe new bartender , Hannah, is terrific and knows her wines. She told me the Riesling was too sweet for her and that if I liked less sweet Riesling, I'd not be happy. I tried a Sauvignon when I picked up my to go pizza and liked it so much I ended up staying for another. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, when Piatti closed, my boyfriend and I had a wonderful dinner and I remember the succotash side fondly along with a soup and appetizer but don't remember what it was specially, but definitely one of us had fish. \n\nPiatti was, well, Piatti. The best thing about it was the decor and the 7/glass Piatti cab, along with that bread basket with the chili /balsamic dipping sauce. A good budget meal with the 7/glass wine and a soup or appetizer. \n\nBut Piatti was underwhelming and probably lasted as long as it did for sentimental reasons. \n\nThe Wine Bistro is far superior both in terms of food and overall experience. We love that side room with the little fire but the  main room is nice as well. \n\nThe clientele is pretty much the same, lots of Montecito locals and longtime residents. \n\nI will come back soon, at least for a drink and appetizer. The sides are terrific and if you want to keep the bill down, wine by the glass and a couple sides is the way to go.",

The garlic fries are giant wedges of potato fried and smothered in chopped garlic and herbs.  So much garlic that they are not for the faint of heart!  They smell so good that others in the bar came by to ask what we had.  \n\nSkip the hummus.  It's not bad, but you can get better elsewhere and they do other things better.

  "text": "Keyword: Authentic, Northern Thai, Unique \n\nI believe the above word define this restaurant. They are the best Thai now in my book in the Bay Area. This restaurant just open less than a month but it does have all the unique food that you will not find any where. One thing I have to warn you is their food is spicy when you have the chef select the medium hot. For me I like very hot. \n\nThey serve street food that only can be found in the northern kingdom of Siam - Khao Soi. This is a unique dish that only this restaurant have it. The  dish include crispy and egg noodle with chicken in coconut milk curry. The chicken include the breast and chicken drumsticks. \n\nThey also serve Pla Koong that I like. I have this dish when I am in Miami from an authentic Thai restaurant. I have try many Thai restaurant but non have come close. Now I found my favorite again. This is broil shrimps in very spicy mixed of lemony base spices. It include lemon grass and kefir lime leave. Yum. Very spicy. Love it. \n\nWe also order the crispy duck in basil leave. The spice they use is difficult to describe. Very good dish. We order a drunken noodle. But this time the noodle is too soggy. I have this noodle at their lunch before and it is better. We also order another northern Thai  - ginger curry. It is pork shoulder in long hours braised cooking. This is a sweet dish. For the rice you can order the white rice or the sticky rice. I never thought the sticky rice go very well with curry. \n\nI hope all yelper make an extra mile to support new and unique restaurant. The menu is still evolving since they can cook many northern dishes of the Thai cuisine. This restaurant do not serve alcohol but they allow you BYOB. I brought my sake. Very convenient and saving.",

I dropped the car off and had a Geico insurance employee do an estimate on my car right there. Right after that an employee from Enterprise Rent-A-Car greets you and works out the rental car situation. They do this all on site. You hop in your rental and drive away. The whole process only takes about 20 mins. Definitely the most efficient and stress-free \"car problem\" situation I've ever had. 4 days later I return to pick up the car on a Saturday morning. I drop off the rental and away I drive in my fixed car. The car was repaired beautifully.. Back to her original glory!!!  They washed the car and wheels and also vaccumed out the interior. Very happy with how this shop does business. I would like to also say I have been coming here for years with many of my other cars and have always had a positive experience. Marty really takes care of his customers.",

  "text": "Absolutely adore this place! So glad I discovered it, because I use them all the time now. (Well, to be fair, I didn't actually discover Parcels & Post. My roommate recommended them to me.) \n\nFirst of all, in the digital age, it's virtually impossible to buy stamps. Anywhere. It's maddening. As I'm sure you can imagine, Parcels & Post sells stamps, and they'll also handle any and all of your shipping needs. I literally handed them a suitcase I needed to ship back to my mom, no box, no instructions, just a \"please send this to [address]\" and voila! They did something (probably magic), and my mom received it the following week. So easy. \n\nMy other favorite thing about this place is the fact that it's far more than a one-stop-shop for all your postage and shipping needs. It feels very much like a community center of sorts: they sell various items from local artists (I found THE perfect wedding card for my cousin here), and they also have one of those \"take a book, leave a book\" bookcases. Love it. Totally borrowed a book from there the other day, and have a bunch that I'm going to donate to their collection when I come back. \n\nThis place is super convenient for me, since it's basically right up the street, but it's even worth the drive if you happen to live somewhere other than uptown. There's a parking lot and everything! They also do pick ups if you have stuff to ship, and probably a whole bunch of other stuff I don't even know about. So if I've not covered something in this review, just give 'em a call! I'm sure they'll be more than happy to help.",

When I saw this morning that they dropped it to $29.95, I was sold!\n\nNow, let me start by saying that they did decrease the size of the buffet to make the price better.  Honestly, still an amazing buffet.  You get a full on buffet as well as about 20 different small plates to choose from, which they bring out quickly and with no issue.  My favorite part of this brunch:  unlimited mimosas and bloody marys, which they do not skimp on!  I won't go into the details of all of the food, but I will say...it was allllllllllll good!\n\nLocated right on Rocky Point, it is a lovely spot to look out and take in the beauty of the Tampa water and after a few mimosas you will be feeling quite happy!",

  "text": "This spot was our jam back in the day when it was Kildares. On a tour of of old haunts in honor of my husband's recent birthday we decided to stop by despite being a bit super partial to the old residents. We were actually quite impressed with the renovations and the new vibes! \n\nThe place is super hip and obviously inspired by music. I loved the photos of my old pals Janis and Jimi downstairs, and certainly the guitars and old school blues concert posters on the walls upstairs in the \"juke joint\". \n\nWe came for date night and enjoyed live music by  Big Soul Chicken band. (Check their site for a listing of upcoming performers.)They were awesome and played their original tunes as well as classics we all know and love. Perfect place to come whether you want it as background music or more of a concert/dancing type of night. \n\n While the \"juke joint\" wasn't nearly as nitty and gritty as the authentic ones I've been to on the back roads in Mississippi and in the south in general, it certainly gave me a bit of that area I desire from time to time. There's not enough live music places in the city in my opinion. Let alone free to enter ones! This place is a great find! \n\nIt's super groovy, dark and sexy feeling up in the juke joint. Lots of candles and even a fireplace. Perfect for a night out with my love! \n\nThe cocktails were awesome and ran about $26 for two before gratuity. We chose the Lynchburg Basil Lemonade (Jack Daniels, Fresh Basil, Homemade Southern Lemonade) and the Black Cherry Gimlet (Black Cherry Vodka, Vanilla, Lime, maraschino Cherry). I honestly cannot choose a favorite! Both were carefully crafted, alcohol filled and absolutely delicious! Whiskey and Bourbon are obviously their specialty and I really loved the barrels scattered about doubling as side tables! The beer list was rather extensive also! \n\nThe menu, like the entire place, is influenced by the South. They have a late night menu, kids menu, brunch, lunch and dinner. We can't wait to return perhaps for brunch with the kids or \"social hour\" as they call it. There's daily specials during that 5-7pm period with $4 wines, $3 brews and $4-$6 smaller plates. The mushroom and kale salads were calling my name and the crawfish Mac and cheese sounds right up hub's alley. \n\nSuper fun find!! \nKiosk parking. Lots of spots. There's also an hourly lot under Abbots Square.",

  "text": "What an awesome treat.  We were down the road at Diggerland and a local friend told us of this place.  I'm so glad he did as we really enjoyed our food.\n\nThis place is located on a main road in a small strip mall.   \n\nThere is a main counter where you can order food and take it to go.  \n\nWe sat in the side room which had waiter service.  The waiter were really nice and helpful.\n\nThe kid had a chicken tender kids meal which was $5.  It came with two tenders and fries which was plenty for him for lunch.   \n\nI had the Caprese chicken with a side bowl of tomato soup.  The Caprese had mozzerlla, tomoato, basil pesto on  grilled Italian bread.\n\nHubby had the Mushroom and feta with fries.  His sandwich had American provolone, muenster, feta, mushroom and argula.  \n\nWe each took a half a sandwich.   I wish I cut THOSE halfs in half. It was HUGE.  Three hours later we are still full.   The sandwiches were amazing.   The fries were tasty.  \n\nThe soup was really good.   It's hard to make good tomato soup and they have it down packed.  I'm a soup eater and I wish I lived closer to get this soup more often.\n\nI'm not a big grilled cheese eater but I'm glad I tried this place.  I was not disappointed.\n\nIf I am in the area I would definitely stop in again.",

  "text": "The little dining huts in the outdoor seating area are sooo cute and inviting for this little spot! They were occupied when I arrived, but nice touch!\n\nService was great. With the help of our waiter I was able to customize by combo of beef, mixed veggies and ginger for $13.95. Entree comes with a side Tom Kha soup or salad. I could tell the soup was well made, I'm just personally not a huge fan of the taste of fish sauce and coconut milk mixed...ha, should have ordered salad. Anyway, the rest of the food was okay. Again, well prepared, but lacked a bit of seasoning. The American in me added salt and pepper, but I think it needed something else. Filling and healthy nonetheless. On another visit I would order something else. I did really enjoyed the shrimp roll that came along with the combo. I believe it was like a fried rice roll. I wasn't crazy about the egg roll. \n\nThe hot ginger tea was very nice and soothing for a cool Santa Barbara evening. It was a bit chilly, so upon request our waiter turned on the outdoor heaters for us which was nice touch. Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their meals. Even though I wasn't wowed, I'd come here again...but I'm snagging a hut and ordering something else.",

  "text": "I went to this store to experience the famous Blue Bell ice cream. My Southern and Texas friends swear it is the best ice cream on the earth. When someone says, \"Best on the earth,\" that is like throwing down the ice scoop to a challenge. \n\nThe Blue Bell is located in the front of the store. It's on the backside of the huge glass display case for the truffles, caramel apples and specialty chocolates. When I went, I was expecting maybe six or so flavors being offered on a rotating schedule. To my surprise, there were over two dozen flavors to choose from. For a brief moment I felt like a kid in a candy shop. Oh wait, I was in a candy shop, that had an ice cream parlor too. \n\nThe young lady working the counter was very patient with me, as I was having a hard time selecting my first Blue Bell flavor. I finally went with, Birthday Cake. It was a rich creamy vanilla with pieces of chocolate cake and swirls of chocolate icing and bright colored sprinkles. I'm sure you have heard, sprinkles are for winners. After enjoying my Blue Bell, I now understand not only the love the South has for this ice cream, but why the South has an obesity problem. This ice cream is too good to resist. \n\nNow, I'll talk about the RSC. This store was amazing, I had no idea they had so much to offer. They had pre-boxed, by the piece, Jelly Belly jelly beans, Weight Watchers candy and some the most decadent caramel apples. This is a great place for picking up a gift for that special Aunt, Grandma or person that stumps you every time on what to get them. \n\nPersonally I prefer local chocolates, Kakao and Bissinger's, but for gifts and Blue Bell, I will keep this candy store on my shopping list.",

  "text": "I've had the good fortune of staying here several times. \n\nGood time to go is anywhere between about September and December. That is if you intend to spend any time outdoors. The pool alone deserves its own review. Lovely, lovely views and two jacuzzis along with a poolside bar makes me -- and others -- very happy. And you can rent out a cabana and get the special treatment. I like that you are actually able to close each of the drapes in the cabanas and have nearly full privacy. \n\nSo, this casino is still relatively new. It opened November 11, 2011. What that means is that you don't walk into the place and find that your entire body is cutting the cigarette smoke and smoke residue. \n\nYou know what I'm saying. \n\nHave you ever been in one of those old timey casinos? Maybe in Vegas? You walk in and the cigarette smoke is so thick you can literally feel it on your skin, sitting on your eyelashes and glazing your eyeballs? \n\nBleeccchhhhttt!!!\n\nMoving on in the review. \n\nSo, yes -- everything is still shiny. And they have some very nice restaurants. I like Mr. Ans and PY the best of the, what, five restaurants they have here. Also, the bar areas are very nice. Trusted there is absolutely no way to get away from the clanks, dings and swirling sounds from the machines. That's OK. Just come along with a date or someone you are so entralled with and you will never notice. \n\nBut -- what?! No taste on the wine?! Fail! Also, the room service can be so, so slow sometimes. But some of the other positives make up for it. \n\nSo, yes -- I enjoy this spot and look forward to my next night over.",

The weather was perfect today so we figured it was a good time to enjoy a cruise along the river! The bikes were plentiful at the location that we picked them up from but we later found none to be retrieved near Sail Pavilion later in the day! You need to download the app and make sure to press the buttons very hard on the keypad, otherwise they won't register your account number. Another warning: these bikes are very heavy so if you plan to go up any stairs, you'd better be strong (learned the hard way!). While the charge is $8 per hour, it is prorated so you will only be charged for the time that your bike is used. I'm glad we have this resource available in Tampa and I will definitely use again!",

  "text": "Asian Taste Inn in the Huntingdon Valley Marketplace on County Line Road, is a primarily Chinese house owned by a Guangdong Province family, that has been turning out pretty good semi-authentic dishes for a while.  The space is well maintained with many booths and tables, and an amiable server corps dressed in tan and green that actually seems to enjoy interacting with their customers.  \n\nTrue to its cultural roots, the cuisine tends toward sweetness, and even their spicy dishes maintain a hint of sugar just behind the chili flavors.  Our Orange Beef and General Tso Shrimp came either drowned in heavy sweet amber, or had it on the side.  Both were framed in Broccoli Florets, the much overused non-Chinese veggie. Their tastes were fine, but we all commented on the unexpected sugariness of the platters.  The Spicy Shrimp, Scallop & Squid with Pepper Corn Salt, was a relief from the cane, and would have been completely on target had it all been crisper.  Finally, my sushi sample of an Eel & Avocado Roll was average, with much more Avo than Eel, and artificially colored Wasabe and Ginger.  \n\nBottom Line - The suburbs has taken the edge off the kitchen here.  Everything was accommodating to the local market.  Too much broccoli, and not enough real heat. Not bad if this is what you are looking for.",

I came in for an oil change with two people ahead of me and was told it would take about 30 minutes. I went across the street to Starbucks and chilled until my car was done. I came back 25 minutes later, and my car was done. \n\nThe guy was nice enough to let me know of something things that needed servicing soon, but never PUSHED any extra services one me. Coming from the Bay Area I was amazed (in the worst way possible) of how expensive oil changes were in the Goleta/Santa Barbara Area. I was called multiple oil change spots in Goleta and was quoted anywhere from $45-$80 JUST for an oil change. In the Bay the average cost is $20, but the mechanic joked and said everything in Goleta/SB is expensive, which is true. \n\nOverall, I thought they were nice, honest, and efficient. IF I ever forget to get my oil change while I'm home (highly unlikely with these prices) then I would definitely come back to Fast Lane.\n\nPRO-TIP: Show them the coupon off their site and your standard oil change comes out to ~$40 (which is GREAT for the SB area).",

  "text": "I visited Joey B's for lunch today. My experience was just ok. They were busy. The waiter was friendly and helpful, but service was slow and our food took a long time to come out. \n\nThe decor is a tad nicer than your average sports bar, but the layout is fractured into several small compartments and they have flat screen TVs galore, but they are not positioned in a way that most of the seated folks can comfortably watch the game. \n\nThe menu consists of standard pizza, salad, sandwiches and pasta fare.  My lunch partner ordered a burger and liked it. I ordered the tutto mare and was disappointed. It was slopped in the bowl, drowning in sauce and too rich to eat more than a few bites. The clam flavor was strong and overpowered the remainder of ingredients. My salad was soggy and too sweet. I know that local Italian salads have a tendency to be sweet, but this one was seriously over the top. Prices were a little high for the quality of food. \n\nOverall, my experience was just OK. I will go back if others invite me, but I won't go out of my way to eat here. \n\nBTW, I'm getting bored with the argument about provel cheese. It is a local favorite. Every area around the country has a \"cheese\" that's typically used, and here it is provel. Giving a restaurant 1-star because they serve a local favorite is ridiculous. Also, just because you've \"been around\" doesn't mean you are a cheese expert. I've been around the world and most of the states in this great country and the argument can be made that most of the cheese available today isn't real. If you don't like it, don't eat it.",

But my experience at Lex Nightclub was just fine.\n\nWe didn't have bottle service or anything special.  We had some free tickets because of going to Fantasies in Chocolate so we expected to go in, check out the place and then head out.  But instead we stayed for about an hour.  I did my white man overbite shuffle and then let my wife tear up the dance floor looking smoking hot and happy.  Nothing makes a man happier than seeing his wife enjoying herself.\n\nWe didn't get any drinks because we knew we would be driving soon enough, but I did get a few waters and the bar staff was super friendly and helpful and hardworking.  The place wasn't slammed, so that may have been part of it.  But the price for a vodka tonic my friend bought wasn't shocking considering the venue.  $11.\n\nThe music had a decent blend to please most. Even some of the remixes and mashups of the current songs were really cool.  The hip hop did NOT please me, but I know it pleases others so it's cool just as long as it's got a good balance of other musical styles.\n\nThis by far is the best club for decor in Reno.  Large floor that can handle the crowds.  Too many of the other clubs in town are sardine cans.  I will say the music did seem a little loud for me, but my birthday puts me in my mid 40's maybe I am just an old fart that can't handle loud as much as I used to.  But at least that's a good warning to the other old farts that might be heading to \"da club\".\n\nAfter doing this trial run, I'm pretty sure we will be heading back down to Lex in the future...my only concern is the dress code.  This time I was in a Tux, next time I don't know if my closet can make the grade.\n\nOh, and one last heads up, if your relationship has an insecure woman in it, this might not be the best club to hit up.  There is guy \"eyecandy\" up on platforms everywhere.  So he will be looking, it's only natural, if this will get you in a fight, go elsewhere.",

Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   \n\n\"We can try Burger up,\" I mentioned.  \n\n\"Why don't you just call them?\" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  \n\nTrue.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  \n\nViper: \"What was her name?  She sounded hot.\"\n  \nMe: \"Paige.\"\n\nViper: \"Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?\"\n\nMe: \"Good point.  At least we have that going for us.\"\n\nPaige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  \n\nBurger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  \n\nBurger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  \n\nIf I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",

However, I am doing it because they deserve it. \n\nAs Christine stated in her review, the customer service here is outstanding. Everyone of the employees I have meet are friendly, out going and helpful. It is like they all take Pollyanna pills before their shift.  It is so good to see people enjoying their work and spreading a little happiness. You do know that stuff is contagious. If not stop by this U Gas and you will see customers come in with a frown and walk out with a smile and they didn't even have to pay for it. Smiles are free. \n\nThe store is always super clean. The booze is super cheap. I can  get my Scotch, vodka and beer here at a savings when I do not have time to make the pilgrimage out to Costco. Their selection and variety of convince store staples have also saved my ass numerous times already.  They also sell me winning Scratch Lottery Tickets. I am hoping for a big win on Mega and Power some day. \n\nTheir prepared foods are done by Gigi and the selection and variety is better then their competitor QT. I've tried the salads, a couple of the sandwiches and I like the way the also package fresh fruits and cubed cheeses for snacking.  My only draw back on the prepared foods is that they do not have the little box that gives you the Nutrition Facts. Being a dieter, I like to have that information at my fingertips. \n\nBe alert in the parking lot, as this place has gotten popular the parking lot has gotten a little crazy.  Everyone rushing in for affordable gas, winning lottery tickets, cheap booze and great customer service makes for a parking lot derby.",

  "text": "This delightful dining spot is perched at the very end of Stearns Wharf, with magnificent views of the islands bobbing in the sea a short distance away. Quite by chance, we chose the perfect time to dine here, and as a result we witnessed during the course of our meal both the sunset and the moonrise, followed shortly after by a light fog swallowing the coastline. With the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us, it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal. It was late in the day and, having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing, we were ravenous, so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense New England style clam chowder. We followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels, served in a white wine and garlic broth, every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty French Bread, and then splitting an order of calamari, sauteed in butter, garlic, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini. Including tax and tip, we stuffed ourselves for only $17.00 each! The very nautical decor and bustling open-air kitchen add to your dining enjoyment. There's a long bar (where food is also served) that seats a couple of dozen, and a massive aquarium - with water pumped up from the ocean below - houses lobsters and crabs just brought in from the surrounding waters. Other waterfront spots in Santa Barbara easily will cost twice as much for a far less satisfying meal. If you're looking for seafood, this is THE place to eat while in town.",

I had everything that a guest would want from a large clean room with a flat screen TV with lots of channels to a pool and fitness center. The room we got was huge and had a couch in it, a mini fridge, great a/c (a must in FL. when it's hot), a coffee maker with coffee, and a complimentary breakfast. The breakfast consisted of bread, bagels, mini muffins and danishes, fruit, juice, fresh bananas, apples, and oranges, coffee, tea, various cereals, oatmeal, and milk. They serve breakfast until 9:30. \n\nThey also have free wi-fi and the place is within walking distance to CVS and a few restaurants and a deli. If you don't have a car to get around and are stuck there, you don't have to walk far to get something if you'd rather not order room service or if you happened to forget to bring something like deodorant. \n\nAlso, the staff is nice and friendly. The room service menu has limited options, but I won't knock them down any stars for that. The price for our room was booked through a hotel site, I can't recall which one, but we got this huge luxurious room for only $89.00-:D I also loved the fact that I had the pool all to myself most of the time which was a big surprise to me. I guess since we were there mostly during the weekdays, it wasn't as busy. We'd go back here again if we ever go back to FL. for future business trips.",

  "text": "Three Dog Night had a popular song that hit number 1 on the charts in the 70's. It was appropriately called \"One\". In the lyrics, it stated, \"One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do\". That may be true in love, but when it comes to dining sometimes you just want to dine alone.  If you do, avoid HWK. \n\nNot once, but twice I have been turned  away when wanting to dine here as a single person. The first time when I called to make a reservation, the young lady who answered informed me they preferred not to sit single diners at tables and that I'd have to eat at the bar.  At first I was content with that arrangement, but then she continued to tell me that  those eating at the bar can not select from the entire menu. At that point, I decided not to make the reservation.  I wanted the true HWK experience. After all the reviews have been amazing. \n\nThe second time, I stopped in for early lunch while shopping the main drag in Maplewood.  Once again, I was told I'd have to sit at the bar and order from a \"limited menu\". When I asked if I could be seated at one of the hightops in the window, she told me she needed to save those for parties of two. The kicker came when I asked if they were already reserved and she said, \"no\".  I ate else where that day. \n\nWhat I do not understand, is why can I go to Chicago dine at such top restaurants such as; Girl and the Goat, RL, The Pump Room, Table Fifty-Two, The Purple Pig, Frontera Grill and The Publican and be welcomed with open arms. Many of the chefs at these restaurants have been on Top Chef and published cookbooks.  How is it that their establishments are welcoming to the lone diner, yet a small Maplewood restaurant is not?\n\nI understand they have a small space, but if you are going to sit single diners at the bar, let them order from the entire menu. Before posting, I shared this review with other friends who are single diners and being women, they said for them they would not feel comfortable eating at the bar and would not eat here if a table was not an option. \n\nDisclaimer: I did dine here as a couple opening week and was not impressed. I contributed that to opening week jitters and wanted to give them another chance. It is a shame that I have not had that opportunity.",

Philly is lucky to be one of those three cities! \n\nThe bar melds perfectly inside the restaurant and does not make you feel like it is the \"bar\" area. Tables fill this room for dining or having a cocktail. One step up and to the side is an elevated floor, where we sat.  Beyond the \"bar\" area that you walk into, is a more secluded dining area, but we were center stage and had a great view of it all. \n\nHubby and I ordered and shared three appetizers. We loved them all, but I was partial to the escargot and the oysters Rockefeller and he to the clams casino, so I did not mind letting him finish the clams while I devoured the other two appetzers. We did skip salads, but hubby enjoyed the wonderful lobster bisque, of which I found exceptionally good, with my one snitched spoonfull. \n\nMy husband had the Prime Rib, what else? I love filet mignon and they have in house made bearnaise sauce, so I stuck with what I love best and it was a huge, juicy and tender portion, very good indeed. \n\nThe restaurant has a lot of class and prices are what you would expect. \n\nWhat I loved most about the service, for such an upscale establishment, the wait staff was not at all uptight. The waiters were professional, but with charisma and humor and knew how and when to have conversation. \n\nBottom line, I would go back in a heartbeat!\n\nWheelchair accessible with ramp through main entrance into the lobby of the hotel and entrance right in through their door.",

Good predictable Thai meal.\n\nBecause I learned they allow BYOB, I brought over some beers from the Giant in the same shopping strip.\n\nI ordered the vegetable spring rolls and shrimp pad thai.\n\nThe spring rolls come out hot out of the fryer. They are sliced at an angle, which allows more of the aroma of the filling to waft up to one's nose.\n\nThe crust was pleasantly golden, both slightly oily and crisp. The interior of the roll was slightly mushy (not quite perfect.) But the mix of vegetables was savoury and generous in portion.\n\nThe accompanying sweet and sour dipping sauce added a needed element of acid to an otherwise very umami forward flavor profile.\n\nThe Shrimp Pad Thai was portioned very generously. The noodles were well executed, firm yet soft on the bite. The dish had a powerful flavor blend of fishiness, savouriness, and sweet. The nuts inside were just crunchy enough to add an interesting mouthfeel. \n\nThe shrimp was slightly over cooked and presented a noticeable but subtle mushiness. \n\nOverall the dish was filling and more interesting in flavor than in texture, which was quite homogeneous. The noodles really did an excellent job absorbing the pad thai sauce.",

I really don't care for beignets but they have those here too and it is all very similar to Cafe du Monde EXCEPT they also have a decent small menu of some New Orleans classic dishes so I would say the dining options here are far superior to Cafe du Monde (but a terrible location in a strip mall).",

  "text": "We dropped by 21st Amendment for some late-night cocktails in French Quarter without going to the rowdier spots. Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.\n\nThat said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.\n\n21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",

We came about 1115am 15 minutes after opening. We could've sat inside and gotten seated right away but instead we waited for an outside table to clear which took about 30 minutes. My wife and I shared the following: Fried seafood platter, scallops and uni, oysters. Everything was great but the scallops and uni on top were the highlight. I would definitely come back here and splurge some more by getting a crab - but its just so hard to crack and eat haha.",

  "text": "I love visiting new places and I love trying local brews and wines when I am in those places.\n\nWe were out and about in Saint Louis and decided it was time for some beer (it is always time for some beer) and turned to Yelp to find somewhere not Anheuser or Budweiser to go to, that was also close by.\nEnter 4 Hands Brewing.\n\nAs we drove up the dead end street, we saw what we thought were food trucks and I got a little excited. But upon closer examination, they were pop-up clothing store truck things. Also very cool! But not of interest to me on that day.\nThere is street parking, but there is also a decent sized lot across the street from the brewery. \nIt is kind industrial, which I like. It fits well for a brewery. Like Brad G said, if gave me Rhinegeist vibes. Two floors for your local brew drinking needs. Exposed brick and wood is the kind of vibe going on. On the second floor are plenty of community style tables, arcade games, projection television, and another bar. If you are floor-hopping, the POS system is connected between the bars, so you can order on your tab at either one.\n\nAs for the beer, they have a nice variety to choose from. I don't like IPAs, and they definitely have more than just hoppy beers! Fruity beers and sours/goses/saisons/shandies are my kind of thing and they had several on hand to sample.\n\nI do wish you could get a flight of 4 for the price of a regular beer, but the prices are per sample. 3 small samples end up costing more than a full pour of something, but if I want to try a few different beers without getting wasted it'll cost me more.\nAlso some bartenders were letting some patrons have free samples (about half a tasting glass worth) before they ordered a full glass of something, and others didn't offer it, or it was just offered to some customers. I would have liked that option and then gotten a full pour of my preferred choice.\n\nStill, if you like beer and you like drinking local, 4 Hands is a cool place to do it!",

Their food actually isn't bad for a bowling alley. But that was far from what I wanted my first meal of the day to be..  So my bookmarks showed that we were close to Turning Point, and the debate ended... They closed at 3, and we walked in at 2. Plenty of time to have brunch.. She chose the OMG French Toast. That came loaded with candied pecans and chopped bacon. I went with the Huevos Rancheros... Both we're very good choices. Her dish was, well, sweet!! What else would you expect out of a 10 year old... My dish was great. It was huge... I thought I was hungry, so I ate the whole thing.... Savory and spicy.. Avocados and sour cream on the side to balance the meal... I enjoyed this meal so much that I needed a nap in Pinsetters parking lot before going in....  The service at Turning Point was attentive, but not overbearing. The menu offered plenty of dishes with enough of a twist to not make it the norm, as if you were at an average restaurant or diner. \nI don't really remember how this place got into my bookmarks. But I'm glad that it was there when I needed it.",

Aww, you gotta get out earrrrrly for *that*\".  We still laugh about it....\n\nWell, over the last few years, we're noticing more & more places recognizing veggies like to eat Southern / Cajun comfort food & they are starting to open up their menus to us! ( YAY)\n\nSeeing that Muriel's Jackson Square had such an offering, we made rezzies to ensure we veggies got fed - you'll want to do this too - veggie or not!  They were packed & quoting 2 hr waits & this was at 9pm!\n\nStarted w/ drinkys at the bar - Sazerac for the Mr & I had the uber-delish Honey Child cocktail: honey-infused vodka & muddled blackberries.  The Mr liked mine so well that he ordered 1 too, to go w/ dinner & just to be nice, I had another as well so he wouldn't have to drink alone\n\nTheir veggie appie had eggplant, of which I'm not a fan so we asked the waitress if they could make their Goat Cheese Crepe, veggie & she said sure.  Since the description said it was topped w/ crawfish, we thought, this would be easy..... but unfortunately, the roulade sauce was made seafood stock. ACK!  Wished you had told us this!  The Mr however, said the crepe was nice & plump, the goat cheese was creamy & smooth & he liked it, barring the sauce\n\nMains consisted of their Veggie Soiree - this was a sampling of little dollops of veggie tastes - some you'll find on their side dish offerings & some not\n\nDivine beets & roasted acorn squash\n\nPolenta topped w/ chickpeas & a basil sauce - flavorful though those beans were crunchy & could have used a bit more time in the cooker.... same w/ the crunchy wild rice\n\nYams were very flavorful & had lots of ginger - the Mr got to indulge in both our dollops of chard - I tried a bite & it triggered my dislike for cooked greens\n\nToo full for dessert, we left w/ happy tummies & thankfulness for a nice veggie night out.  A-OK night!",

I was full after two slices but had half of another one because I didn't want to stop eating.  Someone who I assume was the manager or owner stopped by our table to ensure that we were happy with everything, which I thought was nice.  They have a loyalty program if you are a regular customer.

  "text": "Another recent food trend is the migration of the Hawaiian favorite - Poke - to Philadelphia.  This flavorful concoction of raw fish and salad can be served up in dozens of ways with dozens of ingredients.  I was therefore eager to try out the new Poke Bowl in Northern Liberties and it didn't disappoint.  I built an octopus, shrimp, and albacore Poke over brown rice with nori and tobiko.  Pickled ginger and a wasabi sauce (and a little sriracha too) added the spicy kick.  It was all very flavorful and def somewhat healthy or I hope so. And you can eat in or take out.  My main quibble with Poke Bowl is that this is one of those places that don't provide free water. C'mon  guys ... I think you could give out a glass of water to people who request it without hurting your sales of beverages too too much!\n \nTip - Don't forget to mix your Poke dish well as you are eating it if you don't want to wind up with mostly all rice at the bottom....",

  "text": "Well, I had my second go at Vietnamese food, this time at Kien Giang.  (The first and only other time was at Miss Saigon in the same parking lot.)  I thought this place was solid but maybe it all just isn't really for me?\n\nThe ambiance is basically Vietnamese diner, definitely full of people.  That's cool, I dig it.  I also have to get used to the service that basically seems mad and also seems like they don't want to look at you.  Also, they want to tell you no about things.  Like the bbq ribs will take a long time so you don't want that.  Someone else got ribs later on and my brother was soooo jealous.  We could have waited!  Anyway, probably just a cultural difference or they can tell we are Vietnamese newbies.  I am not sure which.\n\nWe ordered up a bunch of stuff.  My brother got a chicken and noodle pot of some sort.  It was pretty good and pretty spicy and the salad was in the bowl right there with everything else.  I got pho with beef.  The pho was good like before and I knew what to do with the side items and spices.  I had to spice it up quite a bit to get it where I like it, but it was good and comforting and had quite a bit of beef.  Definitely tasty.  Spring rolls were ok.  Meatballs were a random order my brother made and they were just...weird...texture and taste was just not for us.  To me the entire experience was A-OK but not amazing....I think I need to go with someone that really knows the food and helps me figure it out, I dunno.\n\nOnce you are done you get your check and go to the register to pay.  Cash only so bring your dolla bills.  There are desserts and bubble tea at the front too in case you want something sweet to go.\n\nGive this place a try for sure.  As for me, i think I'm sticking to Thai from now on.",

For anyone who has spare time and loves cats or dogs, please contact Celia Gregory, the volunteer coordinator at volunteer@nashvillehumane.org or 615-354-6345.\n\nYou can help in many ways!  This includes walking dogs, cuddling with puppies and kittens, socializing cats, grooming cats and dogs, doing office work, working at adoption events, fostering animals, grant writing or fundraising, transportation of the Teddy mobile shelter, adoption aide volunteer, Working on the pet food bank, Wednesdays pet visitations to the elderly, etc.  They also have the Rover bus that fixes cats and dogs.  They come to various neighborhoods and sometimes partner with other local animal rescues like the Pet Community Center to offer low-cost spay/ neuter.\n\nThis shelter is very clean and the animals are so sweet. Come visit!  Adopt your new best friend today!\n\n* Side notes:\n1. If you visit the shelter often, one perk of being a trained volunteer is that you can go to the shelter when its closed to the public on Wednesdays and before hours!\n2. If you are considering adopting, but aren't quite sure that you are ready, you can foster first and if you fall in love with the cat or dog, you get first dibs on adopting him or her!",

I stopped in today after trying to get into Nom Nom (which was mobbed and they don't offer take out.  WTH?  But that's another review...)\n\nBrodo looks very sleek, new and nice.  Prices seem low enough - but it ends there.\nI got a 1/2 sandwich (Veggie) and a cup of soup (their version of Italian Wedding).  I asked if I could substitute cheddar for the American Cheese (which is a waste of tasteless fat/calories) and was told they only have shredded cheddar - but i could get swiss or provolone.  So I opted for no cheese.\n\nMeanhwile, I start to eat it back at the office and there is a weird horse-radish taste to the mayo.  I think they goofed and put horseradish mayo on it.  Weird - but not bad.\n\nThe soup was salt-laden and NOT even close to being delicious.\n\nNot goin' back.\nSorry.\n\nI spent $8.40 for the combo (no drink).\nOh, and the line waas not bad when I went - but if there is a long line, don't wait in it.

I had a McRib sandwich and didn't like it. \n\nThe other day on my way to work without a lunch the morning DJ's were talking about the McRib and the limited availability. In all the years McRib has been offered, I have never tried it. With it's departure from the menu coming up soon and the positive spin one of the DJ's gave, I thought I'd try one for lunch. \n\nI ordered a McRib combo meal with a small french fry and small coke. Kevin the DJ, said he orders his without pickle and onions. I like pickles and onions, so I kept them on mine. I'm glad that I did, the bun along with the crisp pickles and onions were the best thing about the sandwich. The processed meat was tasteless, it was over sauced with a BBQ that was way to sweet. I thank my luck stars that I had an order of fries. I only wished I had upgraded to a larger size to fill the void left by a flavorless sandwich. \n\nThis is a very clean and friendly McDonald's. I will not lower their star rating due to a seasonal sandwich that I did not enjoy. However, I would not recommend a McRib to anyone, not even my worst enemy.",

  "text": "With emergency rooms being overrun Mercy has a hard job on its hands.  Unless you are carried in it will take a minimum of 3 hours to get in and be seen.  While I was waiting there were three incidents where security had to be called to settle people down.  The reason is everyone wants to be first and not wait your turn.  So they go to squeaky wheel will get me in before everyone else.  When that does not work it really gets bad.  One person near me was on his cell phone telling whoever was on the other end of the phone that if he is not seen now he will become violent.  And of course hello security.\n\nAfter entering the ER it took me from 4:PM to 1 AM to get admitted to the hospital proper.  This is only due to the vast overload.\n\nDuring my wait I had stickers put on my wrist, an IV put in my arm, urine sample before I was in the ER room.  So they are doing the best they can.  Once in the ER room within 20 minutes I was taken for a Cat Scan.  By the time I got back in the room with not much wait  I was told I have an infection and they saw the problem on the Cat Scan.  The diagnosis was correct and treatment started while I was in the ER room.\n\nNow off to the room and the hospital.  Nurses run hospitals as everyone knows.  Doctors come in and talk to you for 5 minutes and in terms no normal person understands.  It is up to the nurse to follow up talk to you and administer your care.\n\nI was at first not allowed any form of liquid just an IV of glucose and my antibiotic.  Thirst is an amazing thing when you can't have a sip of water.  But I was allowed to swish some water around in my mouth.  Ah relief.  Latter I was moved to a clear liquid diet.  Water, broth, and a clear diet sprite and Jello.\n\nDiet Jello never tasted so good.  5 star diet Jello. :).\n\nI came to understand if I did not eat or want to eat something I was not getting out.  So the nurse convinced me after 3 days to try cream of wheat.  And see if I could handle it.  I passed with flying colors.  Within three hours of cream of wheat I was on my way home with 18 days of antibiotics.\n\nI have diverticulitis.  I have had it before but this was in a different place and 100 times more severe.\n\nIn closing why five stars?  I understand the problems these noble nurses and doctors are putting up with and wanted to show my understanding.\n\nps \nMrs. K (the saint) being Easter purchased the nurses an amazing amount of candy.  She did not tell me and all these people were coming in and thanking me for the candy.  In my fever and pain I was so confused.  I swear Mrs. K. likes to mess with me.  LOL!!",

The barback tried to dissuade me from attempting their not-very-advertised challenge even as he shucked my oysters. Live music some evenings. My cocktail was on the sweeter side of okay, so I ended up sticking to the conservative beer list. Smoked fried oysters were plated on a leaf of butter lettuce with a pool of garlic aioli, and I barely got a hint of smoke flavor even when eaten naked. I was more pleased with the fried chicken livers that were served on a bed of bacon marmalade to minimize texture phobia. Good crunch on both menu items. Future hit list: house made gator sausage, pork butt tamale, spiced oyster taco, chicken & house made andouille gumbo, shrimp & roasted eggplant soup, shrimp & grits, fisherman's stew.\n\nFood challenge: 12 local oysters with a heaping tablespoon of their hottest Beaver horseradish on each, to be eaten in 60 seconds without aid of a beverage.\nReward upon completion: one free beer, the oysters get comped, and a hilarious t-shirt in your size that says \"I ate hot beaver ...at Grand Isle.\"\nStatus: completed, 60 seconds.\nAdvice: don't eat dinner beforehand, don't chew too thoroughly, and be prepared for ten minutes of hyperactive tear gland production, fifteen minutes of initial regret before you start mumbling that it was totally worth it (nigh disrespectful to the tasty oysters to down them that fast), an hour of tummy cramps and fermented burps to follow.",

  "text": "Exactly how the decision was made to come here, I could not recall at the time. We lyfted there. He said, \"It's unusual that I don't know where we are going. Generally, I make the reservation and I pick the restaurant.\" The restaurant was quiet for a week night. We were led to the window table. He marveled at the seating selection. There were two best seats in the house. He said. One in the middle but with a bit of privacy. The other by the window. The one in the middle was already taken and we were given the window seat, aka the best seat in the house that was available. I took a mental note. \n\nPhiladelphia has adopted a lot of New York style dining. Prix Fixe menu was abundant. Sbraga offers a $55 per head, four course meal. For what they serves up, it's an incredible deal. \n\nGruyer popover and foie gras soup to start. Rich and flavorful. \n\nHamachi ceviche next. It might be the best I've ever consumed in my life. Lamb tartare had a middle eastern flair to it. Very inventive. The next dish is a pasta dish, jerk lamb bolognese and spaghetti with blue crab were incredibly flavorful.\n\nOrdinarily we'd have enough to eat but we continued with the entree. He opted for surf and turf and I had the fish. It's interesting when you have so many creative dishes on the offering, the dining options essentially become a careful balancing act between what you had previously had and what you would have on the next dish. We were deeply satisfied with our mains. The dessert choices were relatively easy. Sweet corn turnover and cheese.\n\nCheese course as the last dish is brilliant, and thankfully, this being Philly, they don't charge you extra. Most European restaurants offer cheese course as a dessert course. Nice to have them to include it. \n\nWe did not spend a lot of time talking. We ate. And we ate.\n\nSbraga's Top Chef is gifted, crafty and creative.  The attention to detail and the use of varied ingredients were better than an above average pricy San Francisco restaurant. When I worked in Philly in the 90s, I remembered the food was already fanciful. It only improved more ever since then. Just then, it dawned me that Sbraga is listed as one of the 38 essential restaurants in Philly by Eater, and that's how I made the reservation. \n\nSatisfied, I expressed my interest in coming back here. He interpreted it as my general endorsement of Philly, which he frequented for work.  \"Will you come back with me?\" He asked. When I did not answer straight away,  the question became a statement: \"You are coming back with me.\"",

With its small grouping of buildings of varying historic value, it's comparable to Arizona's Tortilla Flat, which was also a coach stop for changing horses and taking a rest or grabbing a meal.\n\nThey're supposedly noted for their more gamey meats like venison, elk, buffalo, pheasant, rabbit, and wild boar.

  "text": "While the Shops At Liberty Place offer an architecturally interesting structure in a modern urban environment, and attracts people for both shopping and sightseeing the latest in city planning, it also likely represents a business model that will not succeed in the long run.  \n\nThe suburban mall made its presence felt as a post World War II phenomenon that mirrored the rapid growth of the automobile industry and the closely aligned migration of a generation of city dwellers into the countryside, a/k/a Suburbia.  They were the successful way to provide the \"stuff\" of life away from the urban core.  They worked well for almost 50 years.  But, as with most things, they were overdone, and failed to adapt to the changing demographics and cultural evolution that they spawned.  Walk through most malls today and you see lots of empty space, failing stores, and a subculture of youth versus elderly hangouts.  \n\nFirst the malls disrupted Main Street.  Then the Walmarts and Costco's of the world, disrupted the malls.  But, the disassociation from the communities where the consumer lived ultimately started to alienate them.  People wanted to return to their Main Street where possible.  More began to appreciate the quality of city life, and returned to the urban centers to once again live and work in the same place.  The suburbs began to lose its charm for many, especially those without young children.  \n\nThese reurbanified folk did not want to shop in malls along an inhuman highway, and certainly did not want to spend much time in a suburban style mall transplanted in the city.  The developers who thought otherwise, are wishing they had been smarter.  The retail franchisers and chain expanders were the last to catch on, but the growing list of failing stores and malls bear witness to this truth.  \n\nSo it is with the Shops of Freedom Place.  Fundamentally, a suburban marketplace miscast as a modern upscale urban experience that it turned out not enough people really wanted.  A J. Crew in a Center City suburban style mall just does not attract enough customers.  Never will. \n\nIt is not that such a public space could never work.  It can, but it requires a total reconfiguration that demonstrates an understanding of what people really want.  What is that?  A return to the village life, or that of the old neighborhood, where people knew each other, and felt like part of a community - in the city.  More impersonal and monotonous shopping is not where we are headed.  \n\nHow accomplish that?  Start by thinking in human scale.  Change part of the Liberty Place skyscrapers into condos and apartments for people to live.  Add a supermarket, cinema, child care, medical facility, and more greenery throughout the buildings.  Create a vertical village or neighborhood.  Where are the green grocer, the deli, the bakery, the corner tavern? \n\nThe central rotunda can still work as a gathering place for activities, but it should feel more like the gazebo in the middle of the public commons.  \n\nPeople want their cities to be state of the art, cutting edge, and full of energy and opportunity.

  "text": "There was certainly  no shortage of things to see on this tour . . .sadly none of them were alligators as the water was still too cold for them to be frolicking about.  And if you have your heart set on seeing and touching a baby alligator like they show on their website, you may also be disappointed as there are not enough for all the boats to have one.  Some people on our tour (from Australia, no less) had their hearts set on it and the tour guide acted like he didn't know what they were talking about!\n\nThe tour itself, was fun.  A couple of hours in the sunshine on a boat?  What could be wrong with that?  And we did see a few turtles, an egret and 3 snakes (not the highlight of my trip, I must add)  And it was too early in the season for mosquitoes too so that was a win!\n\nBut it was so busy back on the bayou that we had to keep backing up to let other boats pass and the quantity of marshmallows that were floating in the water made me wonder why they were pitching marshmallows at the alligators- last I checked meat would have been a better idea but maybe the economy hit the alligator feeding too!\n\nThe $49 tour ($43 if you book it on line) will get you picked up at your hotel in their bus and admission to the boat tour.  If you have your own car- it's only $25.  If I had to do it again- I'd probably rent a car just so I didn't have to hear the crazy tour that the bus driver gave us on the 45 minute drive to the swamps.\n\nHe kept talking and offering up things like \"Katrina . . . . .as seen on CNN, and the weather channel, this is the bridge that people were walking on . . .as seen on CNN\"  or having us note the large amount of closed car dealerships that were closed around the route (I can show him a similar amount of closed dealerships in most states that didn't have a Hurricane).  But the real irritant was as we were driving along the interstate- he would suddenly swerve over to the side of the road and stop to show us some water where he would say, \"See . . . .no one is reck-creating today as there are gators in those waters\"  Urrgh.  After 45 minutes of this I had a headache!  And I kept thinking we were going to be rear ended on the freeway!!\n\nAnd know that you go back on the bus that you came on so remember the number. So we got to spend more time with this guy.   If the \"reck-creating\" wasn't enough- on the way back we went by a space shuttle from the very well known launch pad in \"Cape COD\".  Really?  I didn't know that Provincetown was launching rockets these days!\n\nFriendly, for sure, but I personally preferred the statically radio playing disco songs to the constant chatter of this guy.\n\nGo for the boat ride- it's worth it and a great way to spend a sunny afternoon.  But if you take the bus- bring ear plugs.  You'll thank me later.",

When lit correctly, these photos take on another dimension and certainly tell a captivating story. There is something a bit mysterious about photos such as these, and they are right up my alley.\n\nWhen I was here for Dirty Linen Night, I was greeted by the gallery manager, who was quite friendly despite the crowd.

They know they can get away with it, so they do.  If you really need internet, walk to Bread Co.  It's a few minutes away and free there.\n\nRooms are clean and for the conferences, both big and small that I attended here, the meeting rooms were vast, spacious, well-appointed, and set-up just as ordered.  \n\nI think this is a great spot to treat yourself if you live out in West County - walk to the game and come back to hang out after knocking a few down at Paddy O's.

  "text": "Famished all day, I was on a mission to find a new place to eat, but something fairly close to home. I felt adventurous, but NOT that adventurous to go too far.\n\nAfter living in the Tower Grove area for nearly 2 years, I finally decided to give Black Thorn a shot. All I've heard were good things minus the long wait people usually endure when coming here.\n\nJason and I got here around 7:30. To our surprise there was not a line nor was it insanely busy like we had anticipated. Another thing we had not anticipated was the set up of the place.\n\nYou have to place your order at the bar, get your own drinks from the bar, and pay all before you receive your pizza if you aren't going to keep an open tab. It basically has the same concept as a Bread Co. or Qdoba. Once you order, they'll bring you your pizza out.\n\nWe ordered a 12 inch Chicago style sausage and pepperoni pizza and a bowl of caesar salad to hold us over until the pizza came out. Little did we know that we were going to wait 30 minutes to receive the salad, then an additional 30 minutes after that for our pizza. As mentioned before, it was not busy. It had a few patrons, but not enough to cause the wait like we had to.\n\n8:30pm. Pizza is out. We're ready and holy hot damn, am I excited! The pizza lived up to the hype I had hoped for. The time spent waiting was well worth every bite I ate. I think the only downside is the wait time. I don't know how long it takes to cook the pizzas. I'd assume awhile considering how thick the crusts are, but still, could they not have told us?\n\nAs far as the attitude of the bartender, I have to agree with Aimee K. The girl looked like she had a blank stare on her face, and she didn't seem too pleasant to talk to. I asked her when our salad was going to come out, and her reply was, \"when we get to it.\" I went back to my seat and continued to wait without questioning. I didn't want anything to happen to our beloved deep dish pizza!\n\nAnyway, aside from that, I like Black Thorn. The rustic looking 1980s dive bar setting who outlived its hay day truly adds character to this place. It has darts, hurling, and a juke box. You can't go wrong, especially in this hipster neighborhood.\n\nCome check it out and you'll see what I mean.",

We waited a few minutes and were able to get a table - meant for 4, but we got enough chairs to squeeze 6 chairs around it. \n\nTHE COST: $29 for three small bowls.\n\nNote: The \"Small\" is still a decent sized bowl! We were afraid what the \"Large\" would have looked like. If you want what would be, say a \"Large\" at Pinkberry, then get the \"Kid's Size\". The \"Small\" did keep us full for several hours!\n\n* Island - 4 stars\nThis is more heavy on the berry/tart flavors, and the toasted coconut on top is a treat!\n\n* Cocoa Almond - 3.5 stars\nDefinitely sweeter, between the chocolate base and the banana. This would've been too much sweet on its own if I weren't sharing the Island with my friend!",

  "text": "Once again, the reliable Yelp community led me to another great business while on my last trip to Arizona. I was craving something cool and dismissed the fact that it was about 60 degrees out (yes, 60 degrees is considered cold for Hawaii locals)!  Frost Gelato has a nice large corner location in Tucson on the long and semi-rundown strip of Tanque Verde Road and is in a newer building than ones of their neighbors. \n\nFrost Gelato is housed in a bright clean and spacious space that offers both indoor and outdoor seating. My timing was perfect as there were only two other customers and I found a prime parking stall right in front of the shop and didn't have to wait in line. I was immediately greeted by two friendly employees and they were patient with me while I tried to decide on what flavor gelato I wanted. Of course I wanted all 38 flavors that they offer but I had to be reasonable! What helped was that they offered free samples and I finally decided on cheesecake and salted caramel. I got it in a cup and although their gelato is a bit pricey, it was well worth it because the flavors were on point and the serving was pretty generous. They stuck a wafer roll in the gelato which gave it a nice touch. \n\nThey also have waffle cones and sugar cones including their Spizzico cones which are their miniature sugar cones. The next time I'm in the Tucson area, I will find a way to make it back to Frost Gelato. Why wouldn't I? They have the whole package-great customer service, a nice clean and spacious location with ample parking, and the gelato's top notch! 2 down, 36 flavors to go...",

What more can you want from a laundromat?\n\nI came here to get my duvet washed. I could have washed it here myself, but as someone smarter than me recently said: \"Ain't no one got time for that.\" So I dropped it off with the friendly launderette who was sitting at the counter. She took my info, told me when I could pick it up, and asked me what kind of detergent to use. (She listed off like five different kinds. I chose unscented Tide.) Three hours and $19 dollars later, I have a clean, fresh, nicely folded duvet ready to be put back on my bed. My clean duvet also came in a nice plastic bag with a handle. It's a dang miracle, I tell you.\n\nIf my washer and dryer ever conk out, this will be the place I visit to wash and dry my laundry. In the mean time, I like knowing that I have a place where I can drop off random things that are too big for my washer, and they will come back sparkling (and it won't cost me a fortune).",

  "text": "I have come to this Chili's now 3 times in the past 6 months.  Both my experiences as a party of 3 warranted 4 stars but my experience this past weekend as a party of 7 to celebrate my birthday was not as good.\n\nWe were promptly greeted upon arrival and seated at a large booth.  They allowed us to order first for the two toddlers in the party which is always good.  Trouble is that the rest of us waited an additional 30 minutes to get our food after the toddlers were served.  We arrived before 5pm on a Sunday ANC the adults did not receive their entrees until 550PM.  By then, the toddlers were done and ready to run amok. \n\nThe kid meals themselves were not easily handled by the children.  The bun on the cheeseburger meal was huge and outnumbered the patty at least by a ratio of 6:1.  The chicken strips were oddly enough in what appeared to be a thick need batter that my 5 year old could barely bite through.  Side note: kids' meals here do not come with fruit/cookie/dessert.  \n\nFor appetizers we shared the spinach artichoke dip (yummy) with warmed tortilla chips BUT our plate had what seemed to be the end of a bag with 50% broken so much that we could not put any dip on them.\n\nNext, we shared the southwest egg rolls which were a big hit with everyone!  They come with a cilantro ranch style dipping sauce.\n\nAnd we also shared the jalapeño cheese bites which came out like warm and not ooey gooey at all - it was as if they sat for 10 minutes before coming to us.  And as far as spice goes, I didn't notice any at all.  I'm not sure these would pass the test even if they were piping hot.\n\nFinally... Dinner arrives.  I have to admit that my steak fajitas were excellent - moist, tender, flavorful BUT the $4 add on spicy garlic lime shrimp were a huge disappointment.  The shrimp were laid atop the skillet and not even the tiniest bit hot - they were room temp and rubbery :-( Pretty steep to charge $4 for rubbery room temp. Shrimp.\n\nAlso in out party, a 6 oz. sirloin was enjoyed cooked to perfection, ribs, and lettuce wraps.\n\nOverall the food was pretty good but it was the service or lack there of for timing that was a complete bust.\n\nEnded the meal without dessert because by that time the children were ready to leave.\n\nOverall, I'd come back again in a smaller group but it was a bust for my party of 7.",

The restaurant name meaning \"in the corner of Guatemala.\" If you like get inside of this corner, please check them out. \n\nThe food is an authentic, special flavor, fantastic prep work, and unique. I was surprised by taste. Today we order the Tostadas de Frito. This is an appetizer. It is tostadas top with black bean paste and sprinkle with dry cheese. My wife mistaken the black bean as chocolate. You can smell the heavy fermented cheese smell before you eat. \n\nThe tamale we have is wrap around chicken pieces. The tamale paste is different than many tamale. The taste is more to rice paste than the bean paste texture. \n\nWe have the main dish as Carne Adobada. It is marinated pork with rice and black bean. I would describe the best black bean paste that I have. It cook with garlic and make this bean paste stand out from other black bean preparation. \n\nThe two drink that we have are Rosa Jamaica and \nTamarind. Rosa Jamaica is the best drink in the Bay Area. I have try many place for this drink. But this one stand out.\n\nPlease call before you go. Close on Wednesday. Tuesday close early.

This is a fine dining institution in Santa Barbara and it's French with a star LA chef and the owners spared no expense in the remodeling of the casual, not divey but not nice, State and A which managed to stay in business a couple decades in spite of the subpar food. \n\nIt turns out the owners have grown daughters in NYC and I have so enjoyed my afternoon here. My iPhone 5 makes a hotspot so I'm blogging before I meet a friend at 4 and swim to work off the potato daphinois--don't ask about the fat content--a sinful tower of thinly sliced potatoes with cheese and oil and all manner of terrible things which taste wonderful. \n\nMy scramble--a bargain at 12.95--included perfect carmelized onions, roasted peppers, spinach and a hint of goat cheese--and I will dream of this till my next brunch here after Chicago/Michigan trip. \n\nAfter 5 cups of coffee to wake me up from horrible asthmatic night, I had a glass of the Ballard Pinot for dessert Nice but no better than the cheaper--9/glass--Kenwood Cab which I think is quite a respectable Cab for the money. \n\nThe coffee is good but if you're like my father who, due to his time in the military, requires coffee which scalds the tongue, you will need to pull a Dad and ask them to nuke it in the \"radar oven.\" It's not hot but I don't really care as it tasted good and did the trick: that is, it enabled me to have two glasses of wine after a miserable night of wheezing, hacking and blowing my nose. \n\nI cannot say enough for Maggie's and am so happy it's here in SB. I will come before my next show at the Granada for dinner at the bar.

  "text": "The location is fantastic. Just far enough removed from the mess of Bourbon Street, but still close enough for you party people. Pretty much everything is within walking distance - even the conference center on the river front is only a 20 minute walk away. \n\nI enjoyed my stay here, and really appreciated the fact that they let me check-in at 8AM on the morning of my arrival even though check-in time is typically not until 4PM. I also loved the room that I was given (a corner room on one of the newly added floors). It was spacious and the bed was so, so comfortable. It was like sleeping on clouds, I kid you not. The only thing that kind of irked me was the separate elevator that was needed to access the top 3 floors - it made the whole commute up and down the building quite a hassle. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend this Wyndham for either business or pleasure. They make things very convenient for you - with cab pickups, printing services at the front desk, etc.",

The establishment is large, has a full bar equipped with TV's and fresh oysters clearly on display for you to witness the art of shucking.\n\nDaily Chef Specials are available Monday-Friday. I visited on a Monday and therefore went with the Honey Tabasco Chicken special. However, I started with a cup of Crawfish Bisque soup; a delicious choice to get my palate fired up for the main course. The Honey Tabasco Chicken was the perfect combination of sweet & spicy atop a succulent lightly battered chicken breast, accompanied by red beans and rice, putting a southern twist on a classic dish. I enjoyed it immensely but could only eat a small portion. My eyes are always bigger than my tummy. Jackson, my server, was a real gent & wrapped the remains for me. \n\nLüke is a perfect NOLA spot for date night, business meetings and hour happy.\n\n~Christy",

  "text": "My wonderful boyfriend bought me a Groupon for this place ages ago and I kind of kept forgetting to use it.  Lo and behold it expires September 8, so I knew I needed to get a move-on.  My biggest dilemma was how to use the $45 gift certificate.  I have a place that does my hair and I never cheat on them (see also my review for East End Salon, amazing), I'm not much of a mani-pedi girl, and I feel guilty getting massages without my other half, so I decided to opt for waxing.  \n\nI never let anyone near my eyebrows, which I prefer to keep on the thicker side and I shape them myself, leg waxing at the end of summer seemed silly and shaving takes me all of 30 seconds in the shower, so that left me with the bikini wax option.  I've never gotten a bikini wax and thought I'd like to try a brazilian.  This all seemed like such a great idea when it was an appointment on my calendar, but when the day came I found I was actually terrified.  How much is it going to hurt?  Is it going to be super awkward?  Why on earth did I ever think this was a good idea?\n\nThusly, full of apprehension, I tracked the salon down (3rd floor of the Rittenhouse Hotel, on the West side of the park.  Google maps is somewhat misleading in its pin placement for the address) and entered a peaceful oasis of calming music and Aveda-tinged air. I didn't have long to wait before my waxing specialist turned up to put me out of my misery.  Her name is Rachel and she is a goddess.  \n\nRachel was very direct and matter-of-fact in explaining the process, positioning, etc which I really appreciate.  I'm not exactly shy, but having your bits uncovered for some stranger to be maneuvering around is somewhat unsettling.  She made me feel completely at ease throughout the procedure by keeping up a friendly chatter.  We found a topic of common interest and chit-chatted while she ripped those strips away one by one.  It took about 35 minutes and while there were a few particularly painful moments, it really wasn't nearly as bad as I had anticipated.  I mean, having hair in the tenderest parts of your body ripped out by brute force and hot wax isn't exactly a peaceful relaxing afternoon, but it went by fast and at no point was I tempted to throw in the towel.  She alternated sides with each rip so it helped the pain to ebb between pulls and also gave me the option of calling it off and still being symmetrical.\n\nAll in all it was a positive experience.  I picked up some special exfoliating/calming stuff for the post-wax ouchies when I ponied up for the rest of the bill, and was quite surprised that the wax itself was $65!  Dang!  That's what I pay for a haircut and I'm so cheap I only do that twice a year at best.  The Groupon defrayed the cost down so I only had to pay the $20 difference, but at that price I can't see myself doing this more than once a year.  When I do, though, I'll be coming back here and asking for Rachel by name.",

The arancini were sitting on a tomato-cheese sauce. The phyllo cigars were served with a tomato-based sauce.\n\nWe shared, so I got an arancini, and she got 1-1/2 phyllo cigars. They were both tremendously flavorful and full-bodied. The phyllo cigars were stuffed with dill feta. Besides risotto, the arancini were filled with gorgonzola and steak.\n\nOur entrees were equally impressive, but less eaten. We were both kinda full -- not stuffed, but comfortable.\n\nI took two bites of my tender chicken, which had a tomato and mushroom sauce, and two bites of zucchini (cut on the bias rather thickly to maintain its integrity) beautifully sautéed to the point of lovely browned crispness.\n\nShe took two bites of one ravioli, proclaimed it excellent, and we both took home a bunch o' food.\n\nBy the time we left, place was pretty filled up . . . just like we were.",

  "text": "So I usually hate Yelp reviews that rant about the service. Because, I honestly think that if you're a true food lover, you wouldn't give a rats behind about service. Really good food speaks for itself. And it you wanted to be a big baby and spoon feed, you would have went to your mama's place. So with that aside, let's talk about Germantown Pub.\n\nFood isn't good. Everything I've had here has been frozen and reheated/refried. From the fries to the catfish to the chicken tenders. Nothing here is made fresh in-house. So expect things to be overseasoned and oversalted to cover up for lack of freshness. And let's not forget how dry the food usually is. Like your great aunt's cooch, this food hasn't been moist in ages. \n\nThe real insult to injury was the service our group received tonight. Our group of 12 came here for trivia which is actually really fun. And we're not the standard a-holes that move from our original seats, make tons of modifications to the menu and confuse our server. \n\nSo, I was pretty freaking shocked when the server asked me what \"number you were\" like I was cattle or standing in line at the DMV when I tried to order another beer. When I asked her to clarify, she stated \"I gave you a number when you sat down.\" Um no, you didn't because I would have actually asked you what you mean by number. I've worked in to service industry before so I understand large groups may be difficult but ultimately it's your JOB to remember who orders what. Blaming the customer for your lack of memorization makes the experience uncomfortable for everyone involved. She also claimed my friend's food would \"be here in a moment\" then 20 minutes later came back and accused him of never ordering it in the first place. Like seriously, we all heard him order it and then heard you confirm his order...twice. She also told me \"don't get the Thai sauce on the chicken tenders...it's terrible.\" so I went with plain chicken tenders and just honey mustard on the side. But guess who ends up with the terrible Thai sauce on her chicken tenders, this girl. But I didn't even bother to send it back and ate my dry Thai sauced chicken tenders anyways because you can tell when things just weren't going ever be rectified. Also, not to the server's fault but due poor planning, ALL BUT ONE of the happy hour draft beers was available going into the 1st hour of trivia. Like, you guys didn't realize that as a bar on an event night you may want to have more beer available?\n\nShort summary is, come here for the trivia and good company. Expect the happy hour beer to run out. Avoid the long red-headed server. And eat dinner elsewhere beforehand.",

You read it right, pals, half-price everything. \n\nQueso fundido, ceviche, pork cheek tacos, churros, oh my.  Service is always friendly and accomodating -- they dropped the tablecloths and prices, but not the quality or knowledge.",

  "text": "This combo candy shop and gift shop has some delicious confections to test your will power.  Though I noticed the variety of gifts and cards, I had my attention drawn to the chocolates counter.  (They have a variety of other types of candies including a jelly bean wall and some other fruity type treats.)\n\nAfter looking over the displays a couple times, I asked and found out that you can buy the chocolates by the piece or by the pound.  I thought it best to go with individual pieces and limited my purchase so that my waistline stayed relatively the same size as when I started the day.  I decided to get a pecan snapper in milk chocolate (snapper = turtle), a cashew snapper in milk chocolate, and a dark chocolate covered pretzel.  \nBecause the pieces are handmade, they are on the pricey side.  (After tax, it was nearly $8!)\n\nThe flavor was really good.  The snappers were fairly large compared to the ones you see in those assortment boxes.  They were filled with nuts and creamy gooey caramel.  The only problem was that since it was a hot day, I had a bit of a mess as the chocolate melted.  (Fear not, I am not above licking my fingers to savor the last bit of it!)\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place if you have some will power or otherwise, a very deep wallet!\n\nReview #1214",

Luckily it was a nice day. \n\nWe looked over the menu and then placed our orders inside. I opted for the vegetarian egg white omelette with lots of vegetables! Loved the spinach and avocado! They also have several beverage options. I chose coffee and the peach mango smoothie. Cool and refreshing. \n\nThe prices are good and staff is friendly.

Although, it is hard not to be busy in a place that is so, in a word, Lit-tle. With seating for around 30, not the most comfortable in the world, mind you, it does well to have a reservation if you are going to be a guest.  The Italian menu reads like Lit-erature (I know, I couldn't help it!), sparkling with Italian classics such as antipastos, olives, flat breads and pastas.  The wine list is excellent as well, as one would expect from a venue de vino. The deconstructed environment is sparsely decorated with a few paintings and Lit-hographs (I swear, that is the last one) by local artists.\n\nSo go fall in love with Lit. What can I say... sometimes, it's all in the name!",

Is it going to be worth the pain and suffering?\n\nFirst thing I saw was \"NUTELLA\" - you can't go wrong with that. They have a whole selection of different kinds of chocolate ice cream and that's the first thing you'll see when you come in. It was like they were holding my hand and asking me to stay so I did. The next panel was a variety of ice cream and sorbet flavors you won't see at grocery stores such as Green Fairy (absinthe with chocolate and candied orange), Calamansi, Lavender Honey, Champagne Violette, etc. I was so overwhelmed by the many options so I decided to try 1 safe flavor (Nutella Banana) and 1 weird flavor (Green Fairy) without knowing I could do a sampler. The waffle cone was delish and freshly made. Now, make sure you bring cash.\n\nA few minutes later my stomach was cursing at me but I didn't care!

Looked across the street and spotted this place.\n\nI would generally go 3-stars for your average Americanized Mexican food joint but the dish I had was really more in the 4-star range.  I went with the grilled tilapia and it really impressed me.  I liked the level of seasoning on what can be a bland piece of fish.  I really enjoyed the sear imparted on the flattop and I thought it was great to have a relatively healthy option in a sea of really fattening food.  I also enjoyed the steamed vegetables and dredging them around the plate to pick up some of the queso that came on the fish elevated them to a level you cannot achieve with steamed vegetables unless you also have a cheese product available.",

  "text": "My man is known as \"The Bar God\".  Let me tell you why.  No matter where we go, no matter what time it is, no matter how popular a bar is, this man will manage to get a couple of bar stools within a minute of walking in.  The place can be jumpin' in a packed house and still, somehow, magically, 2 bar stools will open up and voila... we have a seat.\n\nIt's the day before New Years Eve...  New Orleans is packed with tourists, drunks, and misfits.  Every damn bar, every restaurant, good or bad, was packed.  No reservations.  All first come, first serve.  There was a line around 3 Muses like it was the hottest club in Manhattan.  We walked up to the hostess, where she proceeded to tell us that they weren't even taking anymore names.  We were both sorely disappointed.  All week we were looking forward to coming here.  It was the best food we had on our first trip to the city.\n\nAnyway...  \nWe walked away like 2 kids that just lost their pup.  We wandered around the open market across the street when The Man says, \"Hey.. Let's go back and see if we can get lucky.\"  I looked at him like, \"Are you out of your goddamned mind?!\"  Ugh...  but, I agreed.  I waited across the street while I watched him have a few words with the hostess.  He signals me to come over, and \"BAM!!\".  The hostess tell us to wait at the bar and have a drink and she'll call us when there was a table available.\n\nI fuckin love this man...\nWe walked over to the bar to order a couple of cocktails, and what happens???  2 bar stools open up right in front of us and we're in...  UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nThe food...\nStill the best damn food in NOLA.  The menu I noticed has changed so I won't go into details of what we ate because it'll probably change again but expect to be blown away by an explosion of flavors.  (make sure to get the lamb burgers) The chef certainly has a sweeter palate so, for some of you, you might not be so keen on a few of their plates, but I thought it was fucking fantastic.  The bartenders mix a helluva a cocktail.  Try their cocktail menu.  You won't go wrong. \n\nThis is a VERY popular joint.  Prepare to wait.  That is, unless your prayers to the Bar God are heard.\n\nAmen...",

Please refer to that for my general thoughts.\n\nI'm giving Crime and Punishment the extra star because the beer deserves it. After a few visits and about a dozen beers under my belt, this brewery has what it takes to standout and succeed.\n\nMost recently I had the \"Interrobang\" and the \"Peaches and Crime.\"  If you like hoppy double IPAs, Interrobang is fantastic. It can totally play the game with some of those rare DIPAs bad boys that like to float around Philly. On the other hand, the Peaches and Crime was light and refreshing. Not as peachy as the title would allude to, but very complex. Bottom line is that their beers have the complexity needed to differentiate themselves in a growing craft beer world. \n\nAnd guess what? Having Crime and Punishment in Brewerytown has gotten myself and many others into that neck of the woods, including other businesses like Spot Burger. Bravo! I'm seeing even more good things to come with this brewery and neighborhood.",

I honestly had never noticed this church despite driving past it several times along 86th Street near Meridian en route to Trader Joe's. The church has a clean design with a brick exterior and some stunning peaceful areas thanks to a garden and skylight corridor. The main sanctuary features an upper level and gorgeous stained glass windows that allow the natural light to flood in to the stage. The sanctuary is fairly large which explains why the ICC would choose this location. Note that they also offer ample parking. I can't speak for the church services but it did appear that they offer five services during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The upper level of the sanctuary offers a beautiful view of the entire room.",

Not only by the wonderful scent of different spices and herbs. But, the aroma of coconut milk and Curry is in the air. Very subtle though not overpowering, you feel such peace and serenity in this beautiful environment. What you may envision a someone's beautiful home,in Thailand. The pics speak for themselves. They are well worth looking at. That's only the beginning the atmosphere, the food is unbelievably good. Actually I do not want to underestimate my opinion and observation, the FOOD IS AWESOME, OUTSTANDING! I have sampled quite a bit of tight food. Had some good, very good an aaah... The typical run-of-the-mill stuff. Having lunch hour our server was wearing the traditional garment that the Thai women wear, she truly looked like a princess. She smiled, brought me Thai hot tea that I ordered, and it was served the traditional way with the small teapot and the customary small cup. Actually there is a very good reason for the small teapot, and the small cup.It's obvious, keeps the tea fresh and hot much longer then what most restaurants are doing now giving you a mug. I ordered the pending chicken, my husband had another curry dish. We were in a bit of a rush, and unfortunately I did not get to really review all the selections on the menu. I wish I would've had more time, so definitely I will go back. I noticed on one of the peaks that they have yellow curry tofu and it looks really, really good. By the way, IF IT INTERESTS YOU THEY HAVE A FULL BAR. WITH BEERS FROM THAILAND. For those That Enjoy Exploring Beers from other FAR AWAY LANDS. Of course they do have a good selection of Saki. Much to our surprise we were still able to order from their lunch menu. And the total cost of our meal was incredibly reasonable. A bonus, was that I took a box home. And had a wonderful tree the next day. CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK AND ENJOY, A GREAT MEAL WITH A + SERVICE. Thank you YELP!",

  "text": "This hotel has a parking garage that is next door to hotel and is huge and has so many levels so getting a parking spot wasn't really an issue.\n\nThe lobby seemed really cramped and tight at the time we checked in as it was kind of crowded and the space wasn't so open.  They did offer us free warm cookies which was really nice though.  The line up didn't really move very quickly but it was a busy time when we checked in.  The staff were very polite and professional.\n\nThe room and the view was really nice.  We had a had view facing east, not the Broad Street side.  The rooms were clean and spacious enough considering we had 2 beds instead of just one king.  \n\nOne thing that was sort of different was the windows.  Instead of having a regular rectangular room you have a window that has 2 sides so it's more shaped like a \"pencil\" and the window is a tip.  It's sort of nice as you can see more but it's just a differently shaped room.",

  "text": "Visiting Tampa for the second time, our colleagues here decided to take us out to Boizao.  I've never been to one of these Brazilian Steakhouses, but have heard a lot about them.  I knew that I was in for a lot of food.\n\nFood - The amount of meat that you eat here is ridiculous.  14 different types of meat is offered to you throughout the evening.  There is a cardboard circle in front of your seat that is red on one side and green on the other.  If you place the green side up, they will offer you a piece of meat....if you have the red side up, they will pass your table.  I had the green side up most of the evening. I think I sampled everything except one or two types of meat.  Here's what I tasted:\n\nFilet Mignon\nFilet Wrapped in Bacon\nLamb Chops\nLeg of Lamb\nPork Tenderloin\nRibs\nPrime Rib\nPicanha\nPicanha com alho (with Garlic)\nTop Sirloin\nBottom Sirloin\nBrazilian Pork Sausages\nChicken Legs marinated with beer\n\nYep....I pig'd out!  I passed on the salad bar though....as I knew I would have to save room in my stomach for all of this food.  I even had a little room for a Tiramisu for dessert.\n\nService - I thought the service was excellent.  There were 7 of us and we never had an empty glass of wine, water, or food.  The servers were very attentive and cordial.\n\nAtmosphere - The dining room is large and dark.  Nice setting for a dinner.  The tables are spaced appropriately....what I mean is that they aren't too close together.\n\nParking - There is valet parking that's available.\n\nSpecial Offers - I hear that kids under 7 eat FREE.  That's what my colleague who lives in Tampa tells me.  He says they come here once a month with his 5 kids.  That's a great deal.\n\nWill I return?  Only when I'm in the mood for massive amounts of meat....which is not too often.  That's not because I don't like the restaurant, it's because I don't eat meat that much.",

I actually got to sing and get the full experience! They probably have any song you could think of. Just go to the computer, enter your song and name and you are all set! I like that they have the list of singers on screen so you know how long you have until your turn and the people running the whole operation couldn't be nicer. \n\nWhen I came here last I was just drinking water, and I really liked that they have two canteens filled with ice water so that you can just help yourself. I think more bars should do this because I'm sure that bartenders do get tired of people asking for water. It takes up their time when they could be getting other patrons real drinks.",

You need to drive behind Dairy Queen to get to the parking lot. It's worth the trip if your close to Plainfield but get here EARLY. The donuts are delicious. I don't care for cake donuts but our server said I was passing up one of the best. So of course I topped off our dozen with those. They were light, fluffy cake donuts topped with a rich, dark chocolate icing. Thank you for that recommendation! \n\nThey, like many small shops, sell till their gone. At 8:30 the tables were full of locals visting over coffee, enjoying donuts. The cases were close to empty with folks hurry in to grab what remained in the case. I now understand why Al's donuts are a staple for all these years. Even though Al has retired, the shop still honors and respects his love for donuts. He has a new fan as of today's first donut.",

  "text": "The Fishin Chicken Food truck visited our offices today. I had 2 Ahi Tuna Tacos for $8 and it was amazing. They give you a lot of large Ahi tuna chunks, seaweed, and aoili. The Ahi tuna was perfectly grilled and very succulent and you can't beat it for the price. Perhaps the tacos could have used some more sides like lettuce salsa,  tomatoes, onions, corn, and jalapenos but they were still good. My coworker had the Jerk Chicken tacos and liked them as well. They also sell boom boom boneless chicken and chicken tenders. The food came out in a timely fashion and the vendors were pretty friendly and efficient despite some big lines! Food truck graphic is basically a big chicken with a fishing rod that caught a fish. Service is not applicable. No alcohol available. Parking is not applicable as they come to you. Good value for the Ahi tuna, for the other chicken items those could have been cheaper. Because my work offers a $8 stipend these prices might be different when u see them as they were just trying to work with our stipend. Will be looking forward to having more Ahi tuna tacos from fishin chicken again soon!",

  "text": "Pralines and Peanut Butter!!\n\nReview my photos and you'll see that my wish-list line of sweets include peanut butter, peanut butter, and more peanut butter.  Yes, I love me some peanut butter and it wasn't until now, that I enjoy a good praline once in awhile too.  We stopped at Southern Candymakers not once, but twice, during our weekend stay in New Orleans.  This only means that we wanted more and more is exactly what I got. \n\nWhat to expect...\n-Southern Candymakers has entrances on both sides.  I prefer that you walk through the Decatur Street side. From there, you're immediately in line to the register.  Make up your mind quick because the line goes quick. \n \n-The Selection...all sorts of goodness.  Chocolates galore!  As you get to the register, you'll get to the Pralines.  Some of the best pralines are found here.  \n\n-Pre-Boxed Treats\n\n-Souvenirs\n\nMy Selections:  Peanut Butter dominates my choices.  I'm sure the other chocolates were good, but it's all about the nutty taste of PB for me.  Love their PB Pralines, PB covered Oreo's, and the PB Pretzel.  All PB cups were a little too much for me to handle.\n\n-Peanut Butter Praline:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uTva7BqdYwI3JfN8eY5OsA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Covered Oreo Cookies:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jN748Nb2T6S-mletDtm8wA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Chocolate Pretzel:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ELiAwzEGyDkvWPYxac0JOw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Yinlqhp2O-Hw5OO5VeSjw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-White Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ch3Sm7fF-vBcjzosWb_DDA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\n-Peanut Butter Passion Cup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BFNVDZvRgAGHoi1QHkGj2Q&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nOverall, I'm giving Southern Candymakers 4 Stars for service, selection of sweets, the abundance of peanut butter choices, quality, and taste.  The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 Stars is price.  $2.50 for one peanut butter cup?!?!  \n\n\nPS:  Read Terri R's review.  She's right, you are hit with the sweet smell of sugar.  You can even smell it from outside.  Need to wake up..try walking inside Southern Candymakers. If the smell of freshly made chocolates or peanut butter doesn't wake you up, then you must be made of stone.\n\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (033/366)",

And they tell you your order will take 30-40 minutes, which is totally tolerable, but every time I ordered I had my food in less than 20 minutes.  I'm talking breakfast, dinner, and dessert.  No idea how they do it, but damn Loews, you're winning me over\n- Safe\n- Convenient location (especially if you are going to Thomas Jefferson).  There are tons of restaurants featuring different cuisine within 4 blocks and many of them give you the option of take out\n- Awesome gym.  Not only is it huge, but it has large windows that enabled me to stalk people in the Marriott across the street. Makes my feeble attempt at a workout so much better\n- Cucumber-lemon water in the lobby and gym (naturally detoxifying!)  \n- Amazing bath products.  The conditioner is off the chain and thick enough to use as a shave cream if needed (you're welcome)\n- Super duper comfy bed\n- Free wi-fi\n- They'll hold your bags at Customer Service for as long as you want\n- Nice lounge, with outlets everywhere\n\nCons\n- Housekeeping could be a little better, but overall the room was clean, spacious, and very comfortable\n- I stayed in room 923 in a Deluxe King room.  Per the website it says that \nDeluxe King rooms face \"either downtown Philadelphia or Delaware River.\"  Yes my room did face downtown Philadelphia as in office buildings and other hotels.  However, it was not a big deal as I was only in my room to eat and sleep\n- Parking is crazy expensive, but it is a city.  What did you expect?  \n\nNext time I'm traveling I will definitely consider staying at a Loews again.",

  "text": "So far of all the beer I have tasted at the NOLA breweries this brewery has the best to my taste.  The space is pretty cool being in an old movie theater while the geographic location can be a bit on the shady side and challenging to find if you don't know where you are going.  The Kristalweizen and Scotch Ale were my top choices and I would enjoy drinking mass quantities of those.  The space is set up much more like a bar than a lot of the other spots with indoor bench seating like a German Biergarten but no outside patio seating.  They also have some random food pop ups.  \n\nBeer prices start at $5 and go up from there which I found pretty pricey for a beer in this locale even if it is some craft fancy stuff it is still just beer in the end and I would drink a lot more of it at $4 than at $5.  Maybe give locals and beer professionals that commit to 6 or more beers a quantity discount?  Maybe sell in a proper Bavarian liter glass for a better quantity and discount for those dedicated to the beer consumption arts?",

The bartender was pleasant and knowledgeable.  The only thing better would be if he was the opposite sex and gorgeous.  But hey, you can't have everything!\n\nThe place was just starting to fill up.  It was an interesting mix of blue collar, white collar, and the occasional tourist.  There was even a couple sitting at a table with a beautiful Labrador retriever at their feet. \n \nAlthough I was at the bar, I was watching the wait staff work.  They appeared to be friendly and efficient.  Always a good thing.  \n\nMy beers were great.  Yelpers have commented on the fries so I ordered a plate.  I urge you to do the same.  They are really excellent.  The small size was a meal for me.  They have a large.  It scares me to think about it!\n\nI can't wait to come back for more great beer and to try some of the food.",

They also threw some Simian Mobile Disco in there which was a nice surprise.  \n\nThe place is large with a number of long bars inside and out, no dress code and the most ethnically diverse crowd I saw in Santa Barbara.  That's not really saying much though.  The age range was about 21 to 40, I would say.  If you've already a few drinks beforehand and feel like dancing, this would be a decent stop.",

  "text": "I stayed at JW Marriott for a convention recently, plus a few additional days in advance. The convention center area is big and bright and well organized. I appreciated that the elevators were divided into 2 sections, for mid-rise and high-rise floors. My room was comfortable and quiet, and I had a beautiful view to the west.\n\nI only wish the day-to-day operations of the hotel were up to the quality of the convention center itself.\n\nThe swimming pool in this hotel is unusually small. The \"rationale\" for that is that it's a convention hotel. Yet they do go out of their way to advertise the pool. \n\nThe staff here are \"message happy\" in terms of leaving messages on your phone, and if it's a message from the hotel, it won't just go away upon playing it. In that case, you have to call guest services. The first message was in regard to me. The hotel room was not in my name, but I was listed as also in the room. The hotel wanted to know how to handle any incidentals I might purchase. That, to me, seemed ridiculous. Then any day I did not request maid service, there was ANOTHER message, notifying me that I didn't get maid service (perhaps it was because I had the sign on the door?) reminding me that I could request it. I don't require maid service every day, and I went without 3 different days. You guessed it, 3 different messages, one each time, and they don't always turn the light off after that... the important phrase you have to learn to use is \"Can you please mark the message as delivered?\"\n\nIt would have been nice if there were a way to turn off the light on the temperature control. It's quite bright at night, I had to cover it with a towel. \n\nParking is way too expensive. The fee for on-site parking was $43/day. I then learned that the parking fee for cars for the SAME GARAGE, if you were in some of the other hotels in the complex, such as Spring Hill, was less (e.g., $30/day). We wound up parking our car offsite at a lot a half-mile away, for $14/day, with free in/out privileges and a complimentary (plus tips) shuttle. \n\nIf you're going to stay here, particularly for a convention, do a lot of homework in advance, because that may save you a bundle of money.",

  "text": "*Nashville Fall 2012 Review*\n\nBelieve the hype, especially if you're visiting or have kiddos. In town for just a few days, it was really important to me to find a minute to see some good friends who have just moved to Nashville. We met here on a Saturday morning at around 10 before my flight. The line was out the door when we arrived. It moved quickly, and we were seated by about 10:25 (3 adults and two kidlets). Once you're in, the food comes quickly, so I was actually thankful for the time spent waiting in line, getting to catch up with my friends before we were elbow deep in pancake goodness.\n\nI had four silver dollar pancakes, two strips of perfectly-made bacon and a scrambled egg. The pancakes were among the best I've ever had, if not the best, and I know from pancakes. There are crayons for kids, as well as some M&M pancakes that were the hit of the party. There aren't so many M&Ms that you run the risk of sugar shock, just enough to add novelty and get picky eaters out of their shell enough to get some calories into little bodies before their Saturday adventures.\n\nA morning with lovely company at a charming place: I won't soon forget my morning at Pancake Pantry.",

Nothing makes you feel better on a bad day then trying on a sexy pump with a sky high stiletto. Nothing rewards you for a job well done better then the next pair of soles that are coming home with you as a constant reminder of that success, to live forever in your closet. Shoes have no calories, they may break their seams but never your heart. The clicking on marble floors announces to all in ear shot \"I Am Here, Look At Me!\" They start conversations and end an evening with style. Well, I mean, all this is true if you buy your shoes from Who Cares... Cuz if you don't care, who will?",

We got there quite early in the morning, there were few people who were getting things to go, instead of dining in, which gave us all the seating options. They had some tables right at the entrance, and then more seating in the back.\n\nThe cafe is located on the corner lot, so it had lots of windows on the front and the side, bringing in bright natural light.\n\nRight at the entrance, they had some bread and baked goods, such as croissant, apple turnover, and raisin roll. On the side, they had lots of sweets such as macarons, tartlet, and éclairs. They also had some quiche as well. Since we were there super early, the pasty chef was still working on some items.\n\nWe started off with a couple of pastries and cups of coffee. I got a small Latte, and it was really small... They ground coffee beans at the time of order, which is great. The coffee was quite good, I wish if the mug was a bit bigger, even though I did order small. My hubby ordered a Cappuccino, they didn't have any choice of size, it came in a mug that is similar to the latte mug, but a bit shorter and wider. They were tasty coffees, again, just really small...\n\nWe had Sugared Chouquette, Napoleon, French Jam Crêpe and Paris Philadelphia. They were all very tasty, high quality and oh-so-satisfying. It was a fun and tasty visit. The service was ok, not overly friendly but efficient. Their sweets were elegant and sophisticated, we enjoyed them all.",

Seriously, there's no elegant way to eat an oyster that's the size of your palm. I got one bite of shell, but otherwise, the oysters were cleaned properly and very fresh. They came with the simple stuff: wedges of lemon, horseradish, ketchup (spice up your own cocktail sauce), and crackers. Simple, but good. I don't go to East Nashville a lot (I'm a grumpy lady who tries to avoid things I would call \"hassles\"), but if I'm back I wouldn't hesitate to try B&F for something else - I've heard their sushi is good. I'm not always a fan of fried seafood (some seafood is just delicate and doesn't want or need to be fried), but I'd definitely be interested to try out their fish and chips as well. It's an interesting menu and an interesting place. Good service. Good patio (for when the weather is nice). I wasn't blown away, but it was a good place for drinks and oysters done the simple way.",

Or, on the flip side, I'll go there from time to time to make a measly order of \"a side of rice and a side of mixed beans (pinto/black)\". This is my guilt-free approach to Mexican food. What I love about the folks at Fast Burrito is that they never get pissy about my silly 5 bite orders. They charge me, what I believe to be an underpriced $2 for the 2 sides. This $2 is followed by a generous tip because I feel guilty walking away with such a steal - granted it's just rice and beans. \n\nPiece of advice - when the day comes for you to pay a visit to Fast Burrito,  I recommend throwing a little Spanish back at 'em - totally worth the surprised smile on their faces:)",

I loved it.\n\nI ordered Beef Barley soup ($6) and a Roast Beef sandwich ($6.50). I added sharp provolone for $.75.  My soup was hearty and delicious and served at the correct temperature so I could enjoy it right away.  I hate it when the soup is so hot you just have to stare at it and wait for it to cool.\n\nIf you are a roast beef sandwich aficionado there are two things that might surprise you here.  First, this sandwich is served with rich brown gravy not au jus.  Second, if you pay your $.75 for sharp provolone, and you should, it's served on the side.  I don't know if you can tell from my pic but that was a lot of cheese.  Way more than you would normally get on a sandwich.   BTW- This was one delicious sandwich!\n\nThese folks are coming up on their one year anniversary.  I hope they stick around.  I'll help out by coming back for sure.",

I got a pumpkin spice donut which was really tasty, but i do wish they served it hot. That would make this place AMAZING.  The friend chicken was very moist and flavorful. I would actually recommend trying that. They have a bench outside where we ate which was nice, bc its very limited seating inside.",

  "text": "Here is our back story.  Do you have a little time to kill?  Good because it's gonna be fascinating.  I'm gonna wow you with amazing tales of chili dogs and burgers.  No wait...don't go!  It'll be great!\n\nOk well for those of you who stayed...here's my back story.  We were in the GSR for a Pentatonix concert.  We had gotten there early to camp out a spot to get a better seat because the general admission at the GSR is really bad.  So this meant that during our dinner hour we were going to be stuck in line.  Luckily a very nice couple held our spot while we stopped into Johnny Rockets.\n\nWe asked to sit at the bar to make it quicker.  We ordered up two chili dogs for my daughter, a classic burger for my wife and I ordered up the Houston. I upgraded to sweet potato fries for a buck extra.  The burgers coming out looked really good, mine wasn't as good looking and was just fine tasting.  Nothing to write home about or get excited about, just a standard fare sort of burger.\n\nMy daughter however loved the chili dogs and ate them all up and her fries.  She enjoyed the paper hat that came with the kids meal menu.   Our waitress Daniel was really busy but also really helpful and friendly.\n\nSo if you are staying at the hotel for either a convention or just gambling, this place is a good place to eat for a reasonable price.  The prices are right in line with any other sit down burger joint, maybe even a little lower.\n\nParking isn't really that close because it's inside the mall downstairs at the GSR, but it is 1000000 times better than it's old location on the casino floor getting covered in smoke all day long.  \n\nWondering how busy they will be when summer comes and \"The Beach\" is open.  We will see.",

  "text": "Luke is a John Besh restaurant. It is known for their 75 cents oysters at Happy Hour, from 3PM-6PM every day. If you like oysters, this place is definitely for you. However, I tried Luke for breakfast. I ordered the chicken and biscuits. It was awesome. The challenge with fried chicken is that it is easy to dry out the meat. The best fried chicken is tender and juicy in the inside while maintaining the crispy skin on the outside. In this regard, Luke is on par with all the best fried chicken I have eaten. I have also been advised to use honey on fried chicken in the past. Until Luke, I refrained from doing so. However, Luke does not leave it up to you and it puts the honey on the chicken for you. I am glad it did because it was great. I also loved the biscuit. Like the chicken, it was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outside. The portion size is not huge. I was full but not stuffed. The dish also comes with grits. It is good but I am not a grits fan.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

My friends and I originally went to the other location because it was closer to where we were. But to our disappointment, the other location was closed and it told us to go to this location, which was about a 10-15 minute drive, depending on traffic. We got there and saw that Ted Drewes is a historic tourist spot to visit on Route 66 so we knew we were in for a real treat!\n\nThe menu can be overwhelming especially since I wanted to try everything. With the help of the lady taking my order, I narrowed down my choices and ordered the fox treat. And it was amazing. I really enjoyed the fresh fruits in my sundae but I think I wouldn't get the fudge next time because it became a bit too sweet towards the end.\n\nMy friends and I ran into a local as we were leaving and she said that this place is amazing and she has been going here once a month for as long as she can remember!

It comes with salad and iced tea for $10.\n\nI arrived first and was invited to sit anywhere, so I chose a little table for two. Dish towels serve as napkins. There's no decorating in this place, the tables are rather close to each other, and it's a really small place.\n\nJennifer was our server. She brought water right away. We both got the unsweetened iced tea, which was delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe spinach salad was great and accompanied by pickled cucumber, red onion, radish and hard-boiled egg. The dressing was good. It came with a huge cracker thingy that was actually quite tasty with a good crunch.\n\nThe meatloaf was rich-tasting meatiness topped with onion straws. Yes, the meatloaf was wrapped in bacon, but I think there were bacon crumbles on top, too.\n\nThe carrots were fresh and glazed with honey and butter. Cooked perfectly.\n\nThe mashed potatoes had little yummy lumps. I think there was a lot of butter in there.\n\nMy dining partner couldn't eat the carrots, because the glaze was too sugary, so I got hers.\n\nAnd because of that, I needed a to-go vessel for the carrots, a large dollop of potatoes and three bites of meatloaf. It served as a great breakfast the next morning.",

But then again, maybe not, because I probably would have gone here once a week and put on the Freshman 20 instead of the Freshman 15.\n\nI've only tried the hot cinnamon sugar donut and it lived up to the hype. There's not many donuts that are better than a piping hot one out of the fryer. I can't speak to the other donuts that they have since I've only tried one, but they have 3 flavors of hot donuts: Vanilla Spice, Strawberry Lavender, and Cinnamon Brown Sugar. Get one, get two, or just get them all. I could've probably eaten 2 by myself, and wished I was with more people so that I could have shared more. The hot donuts are pretty inexpensive at $1.50, which is what you'd pay for a non-fresh, stale donut at a grocery store.\n\nThey have fancy donuts for $2.50, which is also affordable since in San Francisco, you get price gouged and end up paying ~$3.50 for special donut. They have maybe 6-8 different flavors.\n\nThey also have fried chicken with different seasonings and glazes, but I didn't get to try it when I visited.\n\nWill definitely be back when I'm in Philly again. Affordable, fresh, and delicious. I'm a fan!",

The bartender Kelley was attentive and friendly despite the fact that it was a very busy night. The beer list is great. Favorites for the night include the Yards IPA on cask and McKenzies black cherry cider. They also had kronenbourg on special.

We were the only ones there on a recent Monday evening. The inside is quite nice and several different areas to lounge around. They have a couple shelves of board games but some aren't in the best shape. Saw connect 4, monopoly, scrabble and jenga (the Asian coloured version). Selection isn't the greatest. \n\nOnly one worker was manning the front. They were out of lychee pieces (huh?) and only had enough tapioca pearls for half a drink. I know it was near the end of the night but that's still pretty ghetto. \n\n- Vanilla bubble tea ($4.95) - L and Jboy shared a vanilla BBT. Tasted like vanilla ice cream in drink format. A little too sweet for my taste buds. \n- Mango slush ($5.15) - went with mango bear pieces. Slush was pretty good except  several sips had bits of ice that hadn't been crushed enough. \n\nDecent enough BBT here but I wouldn't be making a special trip out for it.",

Our monthly payment of $10 plus taxes ($10.53) is taken automatically out of our checking accounts on the 17th of each month.\n\nThen they gave us a new Tshirt, a sticker for my vehicle, a list of all the classes they offer and the best times to enjoy the facility. Before we joined they allowed us to wonder around the facility to check it out. There are two memberships...simple White or Black !!\nThe White membership for $10 plus taxes gives you 24/7 availability of the equipment and the classes/personal trainers. You can also go to any other Planet Fitness but it will cost you an extra $5 for those visits and your membership card is needed. \nBlack Membership for $20 plus taxes gives you the same 24/7 availability of the equipment and the classes/personal trainers. But if you go to other Planet Fitness in the USA, it is free. Also with this membership you get to take a friend for FREE...the visitor as total access to all of the equipment with you. Also, with this membership you get full access to the RELAXATION area, which is the tanning beds, the hydromassage tables and the massage chairs. \n\n If you bring a your own lock, you can also use one of the many lockers in the locker room. I love  the locker room area. It is large, with showers, plug ins for blow dryers, great large mirrors, and normal bathroom needs. \n\nThe equipment is amazing !! There are rows and rows of treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bicycles, tons of different weight machines to work different sections of your body. Each machine has photo description on how to use the piece of equipment or you can have someone help you out and show you, NO ADDITIONAL COST..you can also get a personal trainer for FREE as well that will work out a work out regiment for you to follow if you are trying to reach certain goals. Right now !! ME !!! I am just trying to build up a better Cardio routine and burn some fat and loose some weight.. Wish me Luck!!! \n\nIf you are looking for a change and a New Gym...check out Planet Fitness!!!",

It's very pretty and open with great design. \nOur waitress seemed a bit spacey and knew hardly anything about the menu, but it was only their second day open so I try to give some slack for new restaurants. However, she really should have been able to speak to the menu. We started off with the pastrami poutine and it was good but very rich. However, it was a good dish if you are wanting something substantial. Unfortunately that's about where the good ended. \nI had the turkey and brie sandwich with kale salad, and my BF had the fried chicken sandwich with farro salad. \nMy turkey sandwich was not good. It came with fig jam that was way too much jam and leaked onto the outside which made my hands extremely sticky. Overall it was heavy and the flavors didn't meld together at all. The kale salad had too much dressing on it and the fried chicken sandwich was bland. I enjoyed the farro salad at least. My latte was good, but small and the honey latte was way too sweet, but I guess that comes with the order. \nThe menu was promising and I was so excited for this place to open, but it was a let down after two years of waiting.",

Most of the time enjoying good prices and or coupon savings.\n\nI think the issue with this store is its location in what may be the saddest mall in the area. On this visit to VTC I estimated about 4 more closed businesses than just a month or so ago. I would guess at the occupancy being 33%, and that is probably being generous. The store seems understaffed, and somewhat under stocked. My better half felt there were bargains to be had in women's, I can't deny or confirm. \n\nWhen the time came to checkout we did have to wait longer than normal, so long that we decided to try and find another open register. There were several clearance sections throughout the store, if you have time and like a bargain they might be worth a look. Maybe if this mall revives, this Macy's will step up their game. I'd probably visit a different location if I was shopping for myself.",

It only took a few minutes to get our drinks, but the service after that went downhill.  It was a long wait for our nachos, wings and sandwich to arrive - were they worth the wait?  Not really.  The nachos were burned, the hot wings reeked more of vinegar than spice, and the chicken sandwich was bland.  \n\nTook forever to flag down the waitress to get containers for the food we only ate half of, and another long wait to finally get the check.\n\nAnyway, sorry but my hatred of too many loud TVs in a restaurant (sports bar or not) still stands.",

  "text": "My dining companion and I ended up at Three Muses by complete accident. We've made it our mission to eat at some of the more \"acclaimed\" restaurants throughout the city, and after trying to get into Adolfo's and failing miserably, we walked down the street to Three Muses.\n\nIt was unusually busy for a Saturday night. It was nearly nine and every place was packed. We walked up to the door and explained to Candice, the nice woman working the door, that we didn't have reservations and that we had just been turned away from our \"Plan A\". She was completely understanding, and told us that they were fully booked, but she would see what she could do. Well, Candice totally came through and she lead us to a small but perfect table right in the front.\n\nLooking over the menu, I was pretty excited. Three Muses is a \"small plates\" place, so that means sharing. I'm usually not a huge \"hey let's share\" kind of person, when it comes to food that isn't sushi, but I could get into this.\n\nWe decided on the lamb sliders, the fries topped with feta, the shells and cheese that comes topped with bacon and the steak and cake, which is a sliced steak on top of crab cake.\n\nAll of the food was amazing. I think that my favorite had to be the shells and cheese. I found the Three Muses version to be a nice twist on a childhood classic and the bacon was a nice touch. My second favorite was the lamb sliders that had a lot of flavor and of which I could have definitely eaten another order.\n\nThere was live music playing while we ate, and while I thought that the band was a little loud for the small space, I found that it was a nice touch.\n\nI had a great time here and I will definitely be dining at Three Muses again.",

They made a fair attempt to decorate, but the workmanship is shotty and the ugly white counter and an uglier refrigerator in the main room dampers whatever ambiance they attempted to create.\n\nThe Thai sweet tea is delish and only $1.50.  They have lots of Pad stir fries, curries, and of course , my fav Tom Kha soup.  Tom Kha soup (a spicy coconut cream soup with chicken, lemon grass, galanga, Thai peppers, mushrooms, Thai basil, etc.) is one of those things I must have at least once every six weeks and I have resorted to making it myself because so many of the local restaurants charge so much for it!  You can get a small bowl here for $4.50, which is reasonable.\n\nStill, the menu prices are slightly high (I'm spoiled by the prices at Thai House and Thips Thai - both in Illinois).  Overall, it was a nice experience.  I had a great meal and was very satisfied.",

  "text": "Sunday Jazz Brunch was pretty delightful, just a few minor complaints kept it from being five stars all the way. All things said and done, if you are a tourist looking for a jazz brunch then this is definitely one to keep on your short list. \n\nWe were seated in the smallish front room. When we entered the jazz trio was going at it, but by the time I had ordered my bloody mary they picked up and hoofed it far away. The trio rotates through the rooms apparently. It's loud enough you probably can't hear them unless they are in your room. Not exactly what I had expected, but of course, they did come back to our room after I had finished eating so we stayed a spell longer to hear another set in the room. The clarinet guy keeps close tabs on his watch and books it out of the room the second they are done in there. Like clockwork.\n\nYou get a main server and the associate, helping out. Both of them acted way too happy and excited to be there. There is no reason to be that peppy in the morning in NOLA. It was just weird and offputting.\n\nThe bloody mary comes in a pint glass so it is a big boy drink, not a dandy's drink in a little high ball that barely has anything in it. There is a speared lemon and lime wedge as well as some green beans. The green beans were a nice touch. I requested the bloody mary as spicy as they could go and the waitress let me know it was spicy, which is codespeak for \"it comes out of one huge vat, so just suck it up and enjoy it\" - and of course it wasn't spicy. So she brought me a jar of tabasco. Points for effort I suppose. This is what happens when you make drinks out of a giant vat, rather than individually crafted with attention to whether a real man wants his girly drink as spicy as they can do it, or if the dandy fop wants his girly drink as girly as it comes. \n\nYou get free egg bread, it was basically challah, but this doesn't seem like a city that has a large Jewish population, so it was just egg bread. It comes out warm and has butter. It is a nice little treat as an appetizer when your first bloody mary makes an appearance, but well before your food will be coming on down.\n\nI went with the shrimp and goat cheese crepes because I make impulsive decisions. It turned out to be one of my rare good impulsive decisions. The crepes were fantastic. The goat cheese delicious, the sauce was perfectly flavored to accompany it, and the shrimps while spartan were a nice spice of life to the dish.\n\nThe servers were offputting. And also something I learned after the fact at the ghost tour, Muriel's has a ghost. That would have been cool if the super peppy waiters had said anything about that ... but no dice. That's my recommendation, instead of looking cracked out and trying to grab the plate out from under me I am still eating off of, maybe ask if we saw the ghost's table over in the corner with the wine glass.\n\nGood food, good music for the few minutes the trio is in your room. I would come back.",

After two minutes of waiting, we decided we had seen enough action films, hopped on the train and made it to the other side. Eat your heart out James Bond. \n\nWas it worth it? You better believe it. \n\nUpon entrance there was a band playing some tunes. Definitely something I had not seen in a brewery before. Kudos for that. The staff was super chill and friendly.

Stayed around to school some people in Jenga, but ended up getting abused. I was trying too hard to make the really difficult moves.

The caldo de pollo (they recently have cut back on making this) and caldo de camarones are two of my favorites here but they also offer lots of other meats and different combinations.

This is a place my aunt had been wanting to try, so she dragged us down there to give it a whirl.  We ordered up a KIRKWOOD and subbed out the red peppers for pepperoni (slight upcharge), a Schlafly's seasonal draft, some wine and their signature drink called \"Pi Squared.\"  The pizza came our pretty quickly for being as thick as it was.  The sauce on top was nice and chunky and had a great flavor, as did the Italian meatballs, but the pizza crust just had too much corn meal for my liking.  So I ate my two slices, and avoided the crust where possible.\n\nThe service was fantastic.  Our server was energetic and on the ball, despite having a full dinning room to tend to.  I'd like to return and try their hand tossed pizza.",

  "text": "This is really in an old house. The house was built in 1859, and was the first home to be listed on the Chesterfield Historic Register.\n\nYou can figure out which room was the family room, the dining room, the sunporch and the kitchen on the first floor. Upstairs are bedrooms and a couple bathrooms that have been repurposed.\n\nOne of the bathrooms was full of children's toys, plush animals, pull-toys and the like.\n\nThis is folk art, Early American, colonial, Americana -- whatever you want to call it, but you get the idea.\n\nOfferings include scarves, candles (both artificial and real), soaps, quilts, pillows, pottery, linens, placemats, rag rugs and many other soft items.\n\nSome of the real candles had spot-on smells, like oatmeal-raisin cookie, Santa cookie crumbles, lavender, sugar cookie. The soaps smelled fabulous, too: oatmeal, lavender and numerous others.\n\nAnd they had hogwash soap, which is an all-natural stain-remover. A perfect offering, for being in Hog Hollow.\n\nLots of furniture.\n\nEarrings and other jewelry that were quite inviting.\n\nMany hand-crafted decorations. Metal works and wood works of pigs, cows and other barnyard animals. Hand-made dolls. American flags everywhere in many varieties and displayed in artwork, on dolls, framed and other permutations.\n\nMany primitive artwork framed originals, some going for upwards of $300.\n\nOn the second floor there are three large rooms, including a 10% off sale room. Here, we found Christmas ornaments and decorations (some metal, some cloth), braided rag rugs, lighted branches to create your own wonderland and many other decorative things.\n\nIn the kitchen we were generously offered a cappuccino, but we declined, since we'd just had lunch.\n\nThe kitchen held beautiful little appetizer forks and spoons; silicon lid covers in many sizes; Wind & Willow soup, dip, salsa, cheeseball and baking mixes; red pepper jelly and green pepper jelly; Texas hot rub; and a colander that works for draining as well as steaming. I was a bit intrigued by that. I believe I was silicon.\n\nA great lot of quality offerings.",

  "text": "If you are going for the quintessential Santa Barbara seafood experience, you should check this place out. It is located right at the very end of the Santa Barbara pier. There are maybe, four?, small tables on the outside deck which face the ocean. Super cute and quaint. With that said, prepare for a long wait if you are coming during peak hours.\n\nI shared the following items:\n\n-Santa Barbara shrimp cocktail: seven jumbo, chilled shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemons for drizzling. They were pretty substantial in size and the shrimp themselves had a slight hint of sweetness. $12.95 for the seven shrimp.\n\n-a half dozen oysters on the half shell: they go for market price (in my case, $18 for 6) and we weren't offered a variety of oysters. I think they serve whatever is available for the day.\n\nOkay, and against my better judgement, I opted to try their popular Rock Crab special which I believe, comes with a side of soup (good, creamy clam chowder in my case) and a small salad for a reasonable price tag of $21(ish) dollars. Oh, the crab is also topped with onion rings. Mind you, my experience with eating crab doesn't go beyond dungeness crab which usually breaks into lumps of sweet, crab meat. The texture of the rock crab is nothing like that. The meat is slightly grainy and doesn't easily form into lumps, so I found myself with little strips/pieces of crab meat. The exoskeleton of the rock crab is also incredibly hard, so I really had to work for that crab meat. This was a less than desirable crab eating experience. \n\nIt is what it is. I am usually not a fan of American seafood fare, so I thought for what it was, it was good.",

  "text": "Don Day is easily one of my favourite Korean places in the city. I've been here a handful of times now since my original post (see here) and have yet to experience a bad meal. This is a quintessential hole in the wall, industrial restaurant that seems to be scattered all over Edmonton.\n\nThe moment you step through DD's doors, you're greeted with a heavenly aroma. K-pop videos play non-stop on the TV's and Korean posters plaster the wall as decor. The server/owner is super friendly and genuine. It's like your eating at your Korean friend's parents place. Wish I knew some Koreans here...:(\n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward but the dishes are categorized somewhat randomly. First page has appetizers, meats and their specialty hot pots. Flip the menu over and you're left with bi bim bap, meat and a couple other dishes. I have no idea why their jap chae is so expensive ($19.99)! Ridiculous.\n\nAt least they have some pictures of their popular dishes if you need a bit of guidance. Get a hot pot for sure - a small you can easily share between two to four people.\n\nTrip #1\n- Banchan - there's only two side dishes that you get - kim chee and a rotating dish. This one here is miyeok, a seaplant salad. Any seaweed/seaplant is good in my books. Texturally pleasant.\n- Pork bone soup (#18) ($32.99 medium) - you can't really go wrong with the pork bone soup. Hearty, tender meat, flavourful and spicy. There's chunks of potato and think you also get a side or two of rice to go with this. The meat seemed endless. I wasn't kidding when I said a small would be good enough! The medium was hugeeeee.\n- Bulgogi (#43) ($13.50) - marinated beef stew with vegetables and clear noodles. I like how they throw in noodles so it's not just bulgogi. For good measure, there's even a variety of vegetables like mushrooms, onion, carrot, green onion and cabbage.\n- Beef teriyaki noodle (#10) ($11.50) - only available during lunch. These noodles were thicker, similar to udon or Shanghai style noodles. They came out sizzling hot on a black skillet. If you want something less Koreanish, this is worth a try.\n- Hot stone chicken bi bim bap (#39) ($13.50) - mixed vegetables with rice served in a hot stone pot. Rice had a crunchy bite. I'm not sure why they fry their egg here over the traditional runny yolk. Unsurprisingly, the dolsot bi bim bap was run of the mill. Still on the search to find a solid one in town.\n\nTrip #2\n- Seafood pancake (#7) ($15.99) - for some reason, I've never tried DD's seafood pancake until now. Super crispy but just the right amount of thickness/density. This one is almost on par with Korean Grill's.\n- Spicy seafood soup (#16) ($34.99) - I've had their spicy seafood soup too many times to count now. Spicy, decent variety of seafood, slippery glass noodles, zucchini, arugula and a couple other things thrown into the mix.\n\nThis place is a gem. I'll be here again and again and again.",

  "text": "When John mentioned that Jennifer from Top Chef used to work here, I got super excited. Google showed me that it wasn't the contestant I'd been thinking of, but I was still curious enough to want to try the place. The wait was close to 45 minutes as estimated, and we eventually got a small table by the window. For lack of supply our table wasn't equipped with the same set of hot sauces as the neighboring tables. Margarita flavors of the day were strawberry or mango, and a pitcher of the latter pleasantly sloshed us by the end of dinner.\n\nI was sad to see that their menu online hadn't been updated with the recent changes. While I understand that it's a pain to keep stock for a vegetarian ingredient that isn't present in any other dishes, I'd been really looking forward to the cactus and sweet potato burrito. Which reminds me, I haven't seen a neighborhood so vegetarian-friendly in a long time. John was gung-ho about what appetizers we were going to get, so I let him take charge of those while I picked out our entrees. Given the amount of food we were about to indulge in, we opted to pass on the endless chips and salsa. As strongly as his roommate recommended the barbecue, I was pretty realistic about our consumption of food and chalked the pork belly off for a later visit.\n\nI've never seen fried pickle chips cut so thick (a hefty quarter-inch), and the texture was right on the border between cuke and pickle. The spicy chili mayo it came with was an okay pairing, nothing special. Of everything on our table it was the least spectacular, and as a result it was the only thing we left unfinished.\n\nThe single order of veggie wings with ranch sauce arrived at the same time as the other app. Celery and carrot sticks were acceptably fresh, though the celery was the lower quality of the two. The seitan was sliced thin and fried to crisps before tossed in buffalo wing sauce. An interesting plate that I was content to eat, but definitely takes an open-minded palate to appreciate. Not sure that I'd get this again, but I'd be tempted to make this at home if I went herbivore.\n\nSince the shrimp and chorizo burritos each came as a pair, we traded our spares to share the entree experience. The radish slices were nice to have, but I was unimpressed by the jicama cabbage slaw. I think my main criticism is that the tortillas tasted straight out of the package. I would've enjoyed each bite more had an attempt been made to lightly grill the wrappers. The chorizo was my favorite of the two; instead of pineapple, it's now served with roasted red potatoes that give it a fantastic rustic flavor. The wedge lime lightened the heaviness of the burrito, and I could totally picture this as an amazing breakfast burrito if scrambled egg were included. The shrimp burrito tasted of very fresh ingredients, but citrus wasn't present enough to make the seafood really pop. Sadly, this made the room-temperature tortilla overwhelm the light flavor of the shrimp.\n\nService was friendly enough to come by to top off our glasses for us despite the packed crowd and the pitcher being right there for our own dispensation. Two bathrooms behind the ATM/cigarette machines, surprisingly clean and tagged with random graffiti that actually fits right in with the feel of the place. The art on the windows made me smile, and the hubbub was too noisy for me to make out the TVs by the bar. I'd be interested in coming back at least one more time for food, and I'd definitely come back for boozing.",

To our delight, the place was pretty empty and only a few tables were seated. We were lead to a table in the back and given menus. We ordered our drinks and our appetizers and both came out fairly quickly. I ordered a cup of the crab bisque and I really enjoyed it. After finishing the soup we were ready to order entrees, and the waitress was no where to be found. Actually, she was on the other side of the room helping everyone but us.\n\nLet me be clear here: I don't blame the waitress for being slow to take our order. I think the blame here lies in the kitchen. I am more than positive that the kitchen told the waitress to only send back one or two orders at a time. After waiting a while, the waitress came back over, apologized for the wait and took our order.\n\nI was really in the mood for a cheeseburger and fries, so that's what I got. The burger was HUGE, thick and cooked perfectly. It's not the best burger I've had in my life, but it was good and I had leftovers, so I was happy. \n\nThe yummy burger and the nice waitress are why I rounded up on the star rating. Maybe it was just a bad night and they were understaffed. Everyone I encountered was super sweet and helpful. The restaurant itself is very nice and makes for a perfect date spot.",

Inside is this cream cheese filling that is slightly sweetened, oozing out of the toast once you cut into it.  Not to mention, the rum flavored syrup on the plate perfectly complemented the creamy filling.  It was probably one of the best things I have eaten during my New Orleans visit.

It was jam packed with flavor and shrimps were cooked nicely.\n\nThey also offered juices here which were a tad pricey ($6), which we ended up getting to \"balance\" our meal.  But they had a lot of variety of fruits, and only a little extra (50 cents) for additional veggies like kale, beets, to be added to the juice.\n\nOverall, one of the best breakfast/brunches we had during our stay in NOLA!",

But next time, I would only order them if they were to share, because they were so filling!\n\nSweet potato fries are a favorite of mine, so I had to try these, too and they were good! They come with a maple cream - to me it tasted like a mayo that had been lightly sweetened with maple syrup. It wasn't bad, but it didn't have quite as much flavor as I expected. At the end of the day, I'm just as happy with a little bit of salt and pepper. \n\nI ordered the Blue Ribbon burger and it was fabulous! But how can you go wrong with Blue cheese and bacon? Next time I might want to try the gateway burger just to mix things up.\n\nI'd read rave reviews about the Salted Caramel Milkshake, so that's what I ordered. This was by no means a bad milkshake, but it didn't live up to my expectations. I've never been a huge Serendipity Ice Cream fan, so I shouldn't be too surprised, but I thought it was worth a shot. The flavor was generically sweet, but not what I would call caramel. And, more importantly, it wasn't as thick and creamy as this ice cream snob expects her milkshakes to be. However, the toasted marshmallow that sits on top was perfect. (As a side note, you can find the perfect milkshakes at Oberweiss.)\n\n5 Star Burgers is a fun little joint and I will totally be going back soon!",

  "text": "I ate here with brunch on the last morning in town before heading back home. This is a pretty popular spot for brunch, and given the small space, you'll likely have to wait a little bit of time before getting seated. There was about a 15-20 minute wait before our group of 5 got seated, which, considering the tiny space, was not all that bad. It has a bit less charm than other spots in the French Quarter, and it does feel a little bit divey. Our waiter was alright, but he didn't understand my question about orange juice, and somehow my hashbrowns were forgotten entirely when my Big Easy Breakfast was brought out (everyone else ordered the same dish, and it included them).\n\nSpeaking of our food, the Big Easy Breakfast is pretty much what you'd expect a standard breakfast to be - pancakes, eggs, breakfast meats, home fries, and toast. It's relatively cheap, but the food is quite average. The pancakes were a bit overcooked, with the outside being a bit overcrisped and dark. The eggs were over-easy - hard to do wrong - and the home fries were a tad buttery but pretty solid. Toast - quite bland. The sausage was decently flavored, but the bacon was a tad undercooked.\n\nIt's possible that the more regional brunch dishes are better-prepped and more representative of the local cuisine, but the food was pretty average overall. I would come back if there wasn't a line and wanted some standard-issue brunch cuisine, but I don't think I would wait in line again if I had the choice.",

But, of course, while we wait, our food (and the other order of fries) is cooling rapidly.  Finally, We get our fries and go home.\n\nWell, sure enough not only is one order of fries ICE cold, but they completely messed up our order.  The burgers only had SOME of the stuff that was supposed to be on them!  What were we supposed to do at this point??  Get in the car and go back over there??  Yeah, right.\n\nMy boyfriend tried to contact the company (as they tell you to do) through the website, but of course, he never heard back.  I'm not really a fan of Wendy's at all, but this experience guaranteed that I will not be returning.",

  "text": "A Labor Day celebration is not complete without at least one of the following; a parade of union workers, a BBQ Pork Steak and a visit to the St Nicholas Greek Festival. Being able to have all three is like winning the Triple Crown. \n\nI work weekends, so Monday was my only chance to experience the festival. Determined to beat the crowds we arrived early and got Prince parking in the garage. Actually it was so damn good, I'd call it parking for a King. It wasn't luck, we just got there REAL early. In fact, we had to wait for them to set up and get ready to open. \n\nFor those of you who have never attended this Greek Festival, visualize Six Flags or Disney World without the rides. To make it easier for all the attendees, maps are provided with menus from each booth. Arriving early paid off, we were able to read the menus and get in line early. Not being too smart, we got beers and sat at a hightop table and people watched. Before we knew it, some of the lines were already 20+ deep. We immediately got in line at the Athenian Garden Deli, because we knew we wanted chicken wings and a Shish-Kebob. \n\nFor a church festival I am always amazed at how high of quality of food that is being served. These wings were huge, tender and seasoned oh, so well. Our Shish-Kebob was marinated tenderloin, seasoned with lemon and herbs, grilled on skewers over hot coals. The tenderness of the tenderloin, again surprised me for a church parking lot festival.\n\nTo satisfy our sweet tooth's we enjoyed a Loukoumades which is a Grecian beignet covered with honey and nuts. Having one of these, you will go nuts. It is sticky and sweet from the honey and the nuts give it a slight salty tang. \n\nIn addition to the Loukoumades, we had a Baklava Sundae. Don't judge us, there were two so having two desserts is like having one each. The sundae they claim was, tasty low calorie vanilla ice cream topped with crumbled baklava pieces. The Tweens ordering ahead of us, added Hershey's Chocolate Syrup on top. So when I ordered, she asked if I wanted it as well. I told her, \"No, that would be blasphemous.\" The little old man working the soft serve machine laughed and said that he totally agreed with me. I hope that ice cream was low calorie, because it needed to balance out the calorie intake of the best Baklava I have ever had at a Greek restaurant or festival. \nWe both were on sugar highs after chowing down two desserts. Remember, it balances out to one each. \n\nThis festival only happens once a year, make sure to mark your calendar and attend.",

  "text": "Finally!  I'd been wanting to try Izzo's for ages, but had never had the opportunity.  I had heard it was in the same vein as my beloved Felipe's, and since I heard that there will soon be an Izzo's on the Westbank, I was eager to give it a shot and see what was in store for me when one opened around the corner.\n\nSo, by now you know that Izzo's has a \"cafeteria\" style way of serving.  You go up, and you can pick what kind of tortilla you want: spicy, wheat, white, or spinach, and wait a few minutes while your burrito is rolled.  The spinach tortilla intrigued me, but since it was my first time, I went with the basic white flour tortilla.  I got it stuffed with pork carnitas, rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, jalapeños, cheese, guac and green sauce.  Does that sound like a lot?  Yeah, it was a ton!  They put it together for me, rolled it, handed it over and served it with a drink for about 10 bucks.\n\nThe burrito was really dense, well made and good.  I couldn't finish it all and I was happy to have plenty of leftovers.  My friend and I also split some chips and queso, which was fantastic and plenty enough for both of us (we didn't even finish it all).\n\nYou don't have to get a burrito here, of course.  You can also get a quesadilla, nachos or tacos, but most come for the burrito.\n\nSo, my final verdict?  4 fast food stars.  Is it as good as Felipe's?  Nah. Felipe's gives you way more bang, flavor and selection for your buck, but I wouldn't skip this place if I were in Metairie, and I certainly won't hesitate to pay it a visit when it comes to my neck of the woods.",

You can get full rice plates, noodle bowls, banh mi sandwiches, and desserts. You order at the cashier, pay, and choose a seat to where your food will be delivered to you. All their foods are fresh and made to order. I've been here a few times, and the employees are all very friendly and accommodating.\n\nI enjoy their banh mi sandwiches. I usually get the special, which has cold cut meats (pork roll, head cheese, and jambon) with the pickled veggies. I also got Brian's Special, which has grilled pork and egg. I love both sandwiches, and they are always made fresh right at the counter. You can also customize to your taste (for instance, I skip the jalapeño).\n\nSeasons also has a desserts menu with something for everyone! They have shaved ice, bubble tea and slushies, coffee, and regular teas. You can get different toppings on the bing soo, like crushed Oreos, gummies, nuts, and various other candies. They cook their boba just right; they're not too chewy (I'm very picky about my boba). I ordered their Thai iced coffee and liked it. They put a lot of condensed milk in it, which is nice that they don't skimp, but it made it too sweet for my taste. Next time, I will ask for less, but it was a delicious drink regardless.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is somewhat small; the tables get filled easily during peak meal hours because there's only about 10 tables inside. You can also take your food to go. \n\nIf you're looking for a quick bite or a full sit-down meal, Seasons Cafe has great choices for Vietnamese street food.",

  "text": "I had wanted to visit Bella Pizzeria for quite a while. Located in a rather large strip center on East 82nd Street just East of Keystone at the Crossing, Bella Pizza is a four-location indiana mini-chain with locations in Keystone, Hamilton Town Center, Clay Terrace, and in Kokomo. Self-dubbed as a \"New York Style Eatery,\" one can only assume it's because the restaurant tends to be dirty as it's certainly not a description of the pizza. \n\nOkay, I'm sorry. That was a tad too snarky. \n\nBella offers pizza by the slice along with whole pies along with calzones, pasta, salads, breadsticks, a kids menu and some desserts. The location is next to a Mattress Firm  and not too far from Maggie Moo's. It happens to have a couple of accessible parking spots right in front of it, and while they're not quite ADA compliant I'd suspect most people won't have any trouble with them. You enter the front door and head straight toward an ordering counter. They do serve up several specials. I found their slice prices to be pretty workable, though I wasn't as impressed with their whole pie prices. They do offer delivery. \n\nI ordered a slice of sausage pizza, two pepperoni breadsticks and a large fountain drink. They do have Gold Peak iced tea, so that was a definite plus. My entire meal came in at just over $7 - certainly less than you'll pay for mall pizza, though this isn't a mall and they sure don't have the convenience factor going on. You can actually order online. \n\nI will admit that considering their location I'd expect it to be a lot nicer inside Bella. Yes, you have multiple tables where you can sit down and enjoy the meal and they certainly are decked out in the usual New York urban decor, think a grittier Subway, but it all seemed a lot more kitsch than I expected. \n\nI've seen a couple Yelp reviews refer to Bella's pizza as glorified mall pizza and, quite honestly, that's an accurate description. The sausage was chunked, which is fine, but it clearly wasn't fresh and it was barely warm. While I expect this in a mall, when I'm actually in a functioning restaurant I do have higher expectations. The pizza wasn't bad, but there's definitely no way I'd go out of my way for it. The pepperoni breadsticks were warm, though they lacked anything distinct in terms of flavor. I suppose for $7 it wasn't bad, but since I was splurging a bit on my diet I really was hoping for a tastier splurge. \n\nBella's was semi-clean. It certainly wasn't divey, but I couldn't help but notice with 3-4 employees working and about as many customers that it seemed like socializing was a higher priority than actually cleaning or keeping busy. They weren't unfriendly and I didn't feel neglected, but with a little interaction with customers they could have really created a much more positive dining experience. \n\nWith Indy really possessing a pretty good pizza scene these days, it's hard to fathom a good reason to return to Bella's. The employees didn't seem to care that I was there and, quite honestly, if you can't serve me a simple hot slice of pizza then you're really not worth my hard-earned dollars. With Napolese in the mall across the street and Puccini's not that far away, when I want a good meal I'll visit them and when I want mall pizza I'll actually go to the mall.",

Most of the attention was focused on the donuts, but as the name suggests, they also serve sandwiches and coffee here - so a little bit of everything for everyone. We ended up sticking with donuts, trying out the chocolate glaze, spicy maple praline, and cookies and cream.\n\nHow'd it shake out? To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that I had seen on here (and other places on the Internet). The donuts are very much on the thicker and denser side, and outside of the maple praline, I didn't think the frosting really stood out relative to other donuts I have had. I do have a soft spot in my heart (and belly) for maple donuts, which explains why I liked that the best flavor-wise - but it also didn't have any hint of spiciness at all, which makes me wonder why the description even bothered. The chocolate glazed donut was very average to me, and the cookies and cream was also pretty generic...there was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top.\n\nOverall, the donuts are different from what you'd pick up at a Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts, but it didn't measure up to the uniqueness (and tastiness) of other donut-centric shops that I have been to. I would like to come back and try the sandwiches, which looked tasty, but from a donut standpoint, I came away full but a bit disappointed relative to expectations.",

What I found most surprising was the vast number of towering pines, a tree I always have associated with northern climates. There's some spectacular birdlife here - during our stroll, we saw several egrets and a number of attractive species I was unable to identify - and the squirrels are friendly enough to eat out of your hand. Walking too close to the water's edge could be dangerous, as alligators lurk in the thick vegetation just off-shore. It may get crowded on weekends, but on a Tuesday afternoon it was the perfect place to escape for some peaceful solitude.",

No excuse/apology/\"miss, your order is coming up.\"  There were only 5 customers (with normal-sized orders, not catering) in front of me!  The place itself is tiny and not very clean.  There is minimal seating and the tables were dirty and covered with crumbs and used napkins.  They do not take any national offers (not a big deal) and don't make any of the special bagels like the CA powerbagel, chocolate chip, asiago, onion (not even a special variety!), or bialys or bagel sticks, ALTHOUGH they DO list them on the menu, along with prices (much bigger deal).  The coffee was cold (it had obviously been sitting in the carafe for a long time) and barely passed as colored water; usually, the House Blend is medium-bodied and decently flavored.  The coffee here was incredibly weak and tasted off.  I would almost venture that they used a generic/less expensive coffee blend and just passed it off as the official blend.  The everything bagel was so salty that I had to guzzle 2 whole bottles of Nestle Pure Life in my car.  And I hate drinking plain water!  It was also way too dough and did not have the nice characteristic shell (the entire reason for going to a Manhattan Bagel in the first place versus Brueggers or Einstein's or Panera's). It came to $4.54 for a small coffe wannabe and a barely edible bagel with cream cheese that I threw away half of.  Avoid at all costs and go to Panera's across the street.",

After a discussion about the importance of appropriate social conduct and the need for personal space, we proceeded to play for the next few hours on one of the four huge train tables. \n\nThe walls are covered with just about any popular train toy your little, or you kiddo's little, heart may desire and is great place to stock up on birthday and Christmas gifts if the little ones are into this sort of things. Plenty of engines, tracks, cars as well as tons of books, puzzles and games made it a great spot to see what's available currently and get ideas of later in the year. \n\nGreat place to come and spend a few hours on a rainy or nice day. Very nice folks running the place as well. Don't feel like standing? They've even got a bunch of seating for the adults while the little squirts run off some energy!

It was BYOB which we always appreciate.\n4. On our first pass we snagged a parking spot less than a block away. Very lucky in this crowded part of South Philly.\n5. We walked in to this tiny cozy place at 3 PM on a Sunday and snagged a table right away.\n\nEverything was going so well it was time for a bump in the road. The first thing our very pleasant waiter did was list the seven items, that's right seven items, which they were out of.  This included all the skewers and several other dishes. The carnivore in me was completely ready for those beautiful sticks of meat and I was to be denied.\n\nIt turns out that they were slammed on Friday and Saturday and this was the result. Also, it's happened before. LESSON LEARNED- Sunday afternoon maybe great for snagging a table but bad for availability of menu items!\n\nSo with limited choices available we picked PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH ($8) as our appetizer. It was delicious and a perfect way to begin our meal. Some folks may think that dipping raw vegetables into a meat sauce is a little odd but trust me, it works.\n\nFor our meal we decided to split two dishes. The first was PLEAH SACH-KHOE. This was delicious marinated beef with kaffir lime and lemongrass. It was so good it was beyond five stars for both of us.\n\nWe also devoured a CHICKEN CURRY STEW that was incredible. The texture and layers of flavor in the broth brought smiles to both of our faces.\n\nThe wife and I both love this place and we'll be back but not on a Sunday afternoon.  We understand it's tiny and family run but seven items off the small menu was a big disappointment.  However the food was so incredibly good that I'm awarding four stars.",

  "text": "Mmmm... Three Muses, you saucy minx. We'd walked past on Hallowe'en night and it looked so fun and funky inside that we just had to try it! Given that Hallowe'en was NOT the right night for that, we went back the next day. As we were getting ready to leave the hotel we thought it would probably be a good idea to make a reservation. We booked our table through Yelp, and it was super easy, despite the fact that our reservation was only an hour from when we booked! \n\nWe were greeted by the SWEETEST hostess (seriously, she made our night), who explained that our seating was for an hour and a half and that unfortunately you can't book for longer than that given the busyness of the restaurant. As we were leaving we asked her what our best bet for the following night would be (yes we went two nights in a row, shush!) and she said she'd save us a couple of spots at the bar so we could hunker down for the night!\n\nNow, down to business: the food and drinks. The food is to die for - it's SO good!! The butternut squash tart was really the show stopper, with balsamic, a ridiculously delicious salad, and yummy ricotta. I could eat one every hour, on the hour!! Only marginally less delicious were the fish tacos (so succulent and juicy!), and the roasted root veggie salad (falafel AND cheese rolled together?? Get in my mouth!) We also ordered the fries, which were tasty (but fries are fries, for the most part), and the gnocchetti, which were absolutely delicious BUT definitely not gnocchetti, unless that has suddenly come to mean \"regular pasta.\" There was no potato-y dumpling-y goodness, just plain old pasta. Don't get me wrong, it was still great, but not what we were expecting. \n\nWe tried several of the cocktails and they were very good - The Muse was my favourite, I think; it had a great balance of flavour to it. The Earl Grey Gardens wasn't quite Earl Grey-y enough for me! The Minor Swing Margarita was super tasty, as was the Spaghetti Western.\n\nThe service was good (although a little slow when it came time to get the bill the first night, which we didn't mind as it meant we could stay longer!) But the music was really special. Spectacular jazz bands, both nights, and we really didn't want to leave either time! It's well worth the trip for a fun, relaxed meal and some super tasty cocktails!",

  "text": "I was really hoping that my 200th review would result in a stellar five-star experience. I even took myself out of my familiar neighborhood and into an area where I thought I had a better chance of snagging that five-star review. While I was tempted to try out the nearby Nickel Plate Bar & Grill, I opted for Brixx Wood Fired Pizza inside The Depot right off East 116th Street and right next to the Fishers city government complex. \n\nParking is a wee bit tricky with construction going on within the city complex area, but there's an adjacent parking garage that offers spots for those visiting the retail area of The Depot. There's also one ADA disabled parking spot on the street. \n\nThe restaurant itself is accessible with a workable door going in. I was attracted to Brixx by their sign offering a $7.95 luncheon special, though I arrived toward what the end of what would be considered lunch. I was dining alone and was escorted to a small end of the bar that had been clearly designed for wheelchairs. Giordano's has this same kind of counter. I wished I'd taken my seat cushion as the counter was just a touch higher than my wheelchair and required some stretch. They also offer outdoor dining that is wheelchair friendly. \n\nBrixx Wood Fired Pizza offers, of course, wood-fired pizzas - they are all 10\" pizzas and come in nearly 25 varieties including veggie and gluten free options. Vegan cheese is available at no charge, but there's a $3 upcharge for gluten-free crust. The prices range from $8.95 - $13.95. The lunch option either wasn't an option or simply wasn't offered - as I knew I was splurging on ice cream, I didn't want to totally blow my dietary regimen by eating an entire pizza. So, I looked at the sandwich menu that includes six sandwiches/wraps. They also offer starters, pasta, beer, wine, cocktails, salads, desserts, and a kids menu. I opted for a Roasted Chicken Club on toasted focaccia. While I'd thought it was $8.95, a review of the online menu does confirm it is the only sandwich not $8.95 - It's $9.95. You have the choice of chips, quinoa salad, bean salad, or fresh fruit as a side. I opted for chips. \n\nThe entire bill came in at right around $13 with my unsweetened iced tea. \n\nThe sandwich arrived and was about what you'd expect from a pizza/deli type sandwich. It was good, but it was quickly becoming clear that a 5-star review was not in the cards. The sandwich was tasty, but a bit light on the ingredients. However, they mixed together well. It was good and I would eat it again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to get it. The chips were a nice accompaniment, sort of in the Broad Ripple Chip Company ballpark (but not as good). If I could give a .5 star, the food would easily be in the 3.5 range. \n\nThe service? It's always a risk to arrive at the tail end of what was considered \"lunch.\" It looked like there was one manager present who was doing some training and a handful of servers and other crew handling the remaining tables, doing miscellaneous errands, and doing a wee bit too much standing around in my estimation - I say this because in my placement at the end of the bar, I had at least a couple occasions where 2-3 servers would be gathered within a couple feet talking. It was distracting to both my meal and to the magazine I was reading. \n\nThe servers and staff were friendly, though I found service itself a bit off pace. The female who initially seated me took the iced tea order and got me set up, but it took several minutes for my server to arrive at the table. I acknowledged having difficulty deciding on options for a single diner (hoping that would trigger either the lunch special suggestion or another idea). Instead, Jeremy sort of agreed that the servings are kind of large for one person. (Suggestions, maybe?). At that point, I very nearly paid for my iced tea and left. \n\nI eventually decided on the meal ordered. Jeremy was more attentive and was friendly throughout, though he seemed to have other responsibilities that kept him distracted. I did receive my always desired refills, so that was a plus. Overall, I'd put the service in the 3-star range. It was a touch slow, definitely distracted, and didn't make me want to go back. I was disappointed by the lack of suggestions, a bit uncomfortable in the space where I'd been seated, and generally felt like an afterthought during the late lunch hours. However, staff were friendly and I never felt unwelcome. I also thought a couple of the servers who weren't mine actually paid more attention and were conversational. So, that helped. \n\nBrixx was practically the definitive 3-star experience, slightly above average - I can picture them having days where they hit that 4, but just watching them I can also understand some of the 2-star reviews given here. It certainly won't be a destination spot for me, but if I have friends who want to try it out I won't be opposed and would love to try the pizza.",

  "text": "When I started planning my wedding in New Orleans, finding the reception space was one of the easiest parts.  The fiance and I had been served one of the best meals of our lives at Luke's San Antonio location, so when I asked him what he thought about booking Luke New Orleans for our reception, it was an easy sell.\n\nFor your party or reception, Luke is extremely affordable, especially considering the other options in town.  They have two rooms available for rental--one is a private room that can be closed off, suitable for smaller groups, and a semiprivate wine room that's for larger parties.  Our reception will be in the wine room, and we were coincidentally seated nearby, so we could sneak a peek at what it was going to look like.  What did it take to secure our date?  Only a contract saying we would commit to a $1000 minimum, no deposit needed.  Sign me up!\n\nWhen we signed the contract, I inquired about gluten-free options since the fiance is gluten-intolerant and was told the chef would accommodate all food allergies. Anyone who has an allergy as all-encompassing as gluten will give that statement some major side-eye.  But I'm skeptical no longer.  When we were seated, we asked our server about gluten-free options and he went back into the kitchen to talk to the chef.  \"I'm sorry we don't have an actual gluten free menu,\" he told us when he came back, but he went through EVERY. SINGLE. ENTREE. on the dinner menu and told us if it was safe or how they could make it safe (grilling a fish fillet instead of dredging it in flour, for example).  For gluten-free folks and the people who love them, this is the equivalent of a unicorn sighting.  You are told more often than not you can just have a burger without the bun, or something equally deflating.  In fact, our server was so knowledgeable about gluten, he even joked about bring us a bread basket.\n\nWith the menu opened up to him, my fiance chose a dish of house-made bratwurst, pork shank, pork belly and sauerkraut, and I ordered the shrimp and grits.  His entree was a true mountain of meat, each component of it outstanding.  I don't even LIKE sauerkraut and I found myself stealing nibbles here and there.  And the shrimp and grits--ye gods.  I'd had it in San Antonio, so I knew it was good, but it was a pretty excellent reminder.  With bits of Andouille sausage sprinkled into the mix, the fiance and I agreed this one is DEFINITELY going on the wedding day menu. He remarked that usually due to cross-contamination he feels at least a little crummy after he eats at a restaurant, but that his meal at Luke left him without any--er, shall we say, inner turmoil.\n\nService was wonderful--the word that I keep coming up to describe it is \"easy\".  Not because it's simple, but because it felt so natural.  We truly felt taken care of during our meal, which is not an easy feat on a busy Friday night.\n\nSpeaking of which, if you're going on the weekend (and maybe even not) I would highly recommend reservations.  Running late after my bridal portraits and still needing to dress for dinner, I called Luke and asked if my 6:30 reservation could be moved to 7.  No can do, I was told.  I basically disrobed in a flurry, dressed, and we just short of ran to get there on time.  In fact, en route a passerby yelled at me \"Slow down, little lady, you're in New Orleans!\"  SORRY BUDDY CAN'T SLOW DOWN MUST GET SHRIMP AND GRITS.\n\nWith our stellar experience at Luke New Orleans, I'm looking forward to our reception even MORE now--if that's possible--and I'll update after our wedding day.",

  "text": "This hotel is a gem in the heart of Philadelphia.\n\nIt's a cozy, quaint, and charming property. The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. \nThe decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend's apartment than a hotel. \n\nFree breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It's not a hot breakfast (I've had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I'm not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. \n\nCoffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say \"good morning\" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They're also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.\n\nI've read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn't hear a thing. And I'm a very light sleeper...\n\nA few things to note:\nIts location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you're traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. \n\nThere's a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you're not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\n\nDon't expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that's what the city is for... go out there and see something!\n\nOverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.",

This location is not very large, and there are some long waits during prime dining time. \n\nBF and I were super excited to try them out, and we decided on our first go around to order the Tennessee burger and I ordered the Taco Truck on the house made veggie patty, which is a mixture of quinoa and awesomeness. Seriously one of the top veggie patties that I've had in my life. For real. Also, you can sub out any of their burgers with beef, chicken, ground turkey, or the house made veggie patties. As someone that is not a huge burger fan (unless it's In-N-Out) I LOVE the variety and options that they provide!! Wow. \n\nThe list of burgers is crazy, and there's seriously something for everyone. We also had the misfortune of sitting by the milkshake window and I drooled over them being made. Those things are trouble. I resisted this time around, but next time I'm definitely going to cave. Especially since they offer spiked versions of shakes...Uh oh. \n\nOur waitress couldn't have been nicer, she discussed the menu in detail and was quick with suggestions and was delightful all around. \n\nDelicious all around. I can't wait to try them all!",

  "text": "The shrimp! The grits! The shrimp and grits. I feel like every other photo and review on Surrey's Yelp page is of their shrimp and grits, and that's totally okay with me because their fame is well deserved. \n\nIt says right on the menu that the shrimp & grits are gluten free (you'll just get them without the little pieces of toast), so I told our waitress, \"GF, please.\" When they brought me my plate, however,  it had the toast on top.. so unfortunately I had to send it back for a new plate. They were really nice about it and it only took about 10 minutes for my new dish to come out, and I appreciated how hot and fresh it was. Sooooo delicious. The shrimp are perfectly cooked and they're of plenty, covered in a creamy, spicy, rich New Orlean's style barbecue sauce. And of course, this is all slathered on a bed of perfectly textured and buttery grits. Seriously so incredibly good, beautifully seasoned, and addictive. Just really fun to eat, which kinda sums up NOLA cuisine for me.\n\nWe also ordered a fruit plate for the table, and it was so rad! No wimpy watered down fruit here, but big fat slices of honeydew and cantaloupe and really great pineapple chunks and grapes and bananas and apple slices. All the fruit you could ever want and all fresh and bright.\n\nThis is a tiny place, so large parties are gonna have trouble squeezing in. Our group of 4 had a really hard time fitting our plates and glasses on the table. Amazing food and a colorful, casual vibe, but super close quarters.",

Through out the meal time, we still can see some seating is available on lunch. \n\nWe have order the spicy tuna, rainbow, saki, Mexican rolls. The sushi includes escolar, surf clam, salmon. We also order some items from habachi and stir fried. \n\nThe roll I like is the Fuji roll. It has spicy tuna and top with salmon and drizzle with eel sauce. The steak and shrimp hibachi is my favorite on the cook side. I also like the appetizer as Gyoza and the dessert with fried banana with chocolate dip. \n\nOverall the service is great.

  "text": "Someone told me this place had the best burgers in Philly. Apparently, Copabanana also shares this opinion about itself, based on its advertisements. Curious, I decided to give it a try, ordering a burger, Spanish fries, and a peach margarita. \n\nLike some other reviewers, I am also intrigued by the burgers. Although I ordered mine medium rare, my burger came out gray in the center instead of pink. They had literally cooked the **** out of it. No wonder it took 45 minutes for the food to arrive. It was like a piece of cement, sandwiched between two pieces of crumbly, stale buns. \n\nOnto the fries... This may be a matter of subjective taste, but I tend to prefer my fries crispy instead of soggy and oily. These so-called \"Famous Spanish Fries\" were basically a chewy mass of under-cooked soggy potatoes topped with melted cheese, peppers, and onion. Yummy. \n\nHowever... my peach margarita was awesome (hence, the two stars instead of zero, if that were possible). It was pricier than a margarita one would get at fancier restaurants, but if you live a block away and have a sudden/urgent margarita craving, this place will not disappoint. Just stay away from the food.",

Get yourself in the door!\n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nUnlike some of the new-age ice cream spots that have sprung up across the country (Salt & Straw http://www.yelp.com/biz/salt-and-straw-portland-2?osq=Salt+Straw and Smitten http://www.yelp.com/biz/smitten-ice-cream-san-francisco-3 come to mind), Mike's is your traditional ice cream parlor right in line with some of the gems in New York and Chicago. The flavors are on the board, the cones lined up in their stands, and the servers fast and friendly. What more could you want? Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nVery much unlike the new age spots, the prices at Mike's couldn't be more affordable, and my single scoop in a cone, which was sizable as you can see in the picture, was priced at only $3.50. That's value. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nBefore going into my actual Caramel Cone selection, I'll point out that Mike's wins when it comes to flavor variety. Simply too often I've rolled into modern ice cream or gelato spots only to find that I either have basic chocolate and vanilla to choose from or some kale and blueberry goat cheese nonsense. Mike's leaves the gentrification at the door, offering up a huge selection of classics, contemporary flavors, and combinations of the two that are sure to satisfy anyone. \n\nMy caramel cone in particular was very, very good, with the right ratio of caramel to cone and ice cream. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Mike's is the best ice cream in Nashville, and a classic like this would easily secure my patronage daily. Star Granted.",

  "text": "I'm not sure whether to review CDB's or Sake House, so I'll review both. With only one entrance, we chose to sit on the Sake House side and order both pizza & sushi. We asked to sit in a booth, and were easily accommodated as the restaurant wasn't busy on this Friday night. Our server was quick to greet us & take our drink order.\n\nFirst, drinks are 2 for 1, all the time! I ordered sangria, and our sever asked if I wanted half a shot of brandy in it, for no extra charge. Yes, please! Howard had whiskey with a Pepsi chaser. My two sangrias totalled $6, and Howard's two whiskey shots were $5.50 - what a deal, and they were a good size! \n\nInitially, we only ordered two California Rolls, because Howard was impatient to order. After we looked at the menu, we decided to get the $12.99 dinner special any 2 rolls among 40 options, plus a miso soup & house salad. Our young server was not flustered one bit by this change, although the kitchen was and one of the California rolls came out much later. The house salad was good, with lots of very fresh lettuce. Our server told us the ginger dressing was made in-house, and while it was good, I didn't really like the flavor. The miso soup, however, was fabulous! Not too salty, yet quite flavorful.\n\nThe three of us shared a Spider Roll & two California Rolls, and we all agreed they were excellent. The rolls were large & plumply filled. In fact, my daughter, a sushi enthusiast, said the quality & flavor was better than most other sushi restaurants she frequents. \n\nI was not impressed with the cheese pizza we ordered. While I'm not a tomato sauce fan, this pizza had nearly no sauce at all. It tasted like a giant round cheesy bread. I certainly expected better from CDB's. Plenty of cheese, and it WAS good, but this wasn't really a pizza.\n\nWe enjoyed our evening at CDB's/Sake House, and we'll definitely return for the sushi & drinks... And maybe we'll try another pizza.",

Our waitress greeted us and saw that the table needed a bit of cleaning, so she took care of that.  When we placed our beverage order, she brought my wife's iced tea, but forgot the lemon.  Then, my wife had to go ask for silverware so she could stir the tea. We noticed other tables correcting the service as well.  Little things, but clearly the lack of mature leadership on site let quality control slip.\n\nAfter placing our orders, we took in the atmosphere of the place.  As described in other reviews, it is rather stark.  Also, half of the flourescent light fixtures were missing their coverings and a fair amount of those had bulbs burned out.  It just looked like it needed one good day of maintenance and decorating to be appealing.\n\nAfter a reasonable amount of time, a different waiter took over and brought out our food.  He was much more attentive, i.e. experienced.  My wife ordered the Cuban sandwich, while I went with the Caprese Grilled Cheese and Mediterranean Orzo as a side.\n\nThe Cuban was pretty standard:  pork tenderloin, ham, swiss, dill pickle chips, and dijonaise on a pressed bollio roll (with seasoned kettle chips).  She let me eat about a third of her sandwich and we both felt the sandwich was rather bland.  The dijonaise was spread very thin and was barely detectable.  There were probably only two small pickle chips per half, so that many bites missed having the complimentary acid to round out the flavor.  The ham was far less in proportion than the tenderloin, so any saltiness that would be expected was reduced as well.  Simple adjustment to this sandwich could have made it delicious.\n\nMy Caprese Grilled Cheese sandwich was loaded with lots of cheese (provolone, fontina, and mozzarella) so that it had that oozing gooey texture that I expect in a grilled cheese.  It also came with roasted tomatoes (delicious!), fresh basil, and a touch of balsamic glaze on grilled sourdough bread.  Much better overall than the Cuban, but the bites of tomato were not evenly divided so that about half of my bites got no tomato at all.  The cheese and basil were fine, but the bites with tomato were fantastic.  So, what could have been a home run, was hit and miss depending upon the bite.\n\nThe Mediterranean Orzo side dish was served and upon the first bite, we realized that this was a cold salad, not something freshly cooked and tossed.  The salad came with spinach, sun dried tomato, red onion, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese.  It was okay, but labeling it as a side instead of a salad led me to believe it would be warm. \n\nI am giving the restaurant the benefit of the doubt since we didn't order any of the tasty cakes in the display case.  I hear they are delicious, so I will give them a third star for potential.  \n\nI don't think this restaurant would have much difficulty raising my rating with a bit of oversight and care, but I probably won't drive 45 minutes again to give them another chance.  If any of their regulars are on Yelp, please post if you see the management make an effort to fix up the decor and the service.\n\nReview #94",

  "text": "Why oh why did it take me so long to get to The Cheezy Cajun? i wish I had tried this place sooner!\n\nAfter planning to come here a few times and missing out because they were closed, a coworker and I finally made it here for lunch. First of all, the place is small, so you might want to come a little early if you want to have lunch here. The restaurant is basically a corner store that has been converted (at least it seems like it), so plan accordingly.\n\nWalking in, you get a real neighborhood feel out of the place. There is art for sale on the walls and everyone is friendly. We were seated and looked over the menu. I had heard great things about their cheese curds, so I already knew I was getting that. I also got the boudin burger, which comes with sweet potato fries, and I got myself an order of cheese grits just for the heck of it.\n\nThe wait was a little long, but then out came the cheese curds. OMG! Little balls of delicious cheese heaven. I don't think I had had cheese curds before, and if I had they were nothing like this. These were crisp on the outside and melted, gooey and perfect on the inside.\n\nThe boudin burger was HUGE and that's no exaggeration. I could barely get enough in my mouth to take a bite. The boudin burger is basically a giant boudin patty that is dressed to perfection and topped with melty pimento cheese which was a delicious addition.  It had just enough spice and I enjoyed it. Was I able to finish even half of it in one sitting? No indeed, but it kept nicely and I munched on it later. The cheese grits were great as well and for $3 you get a big serving that is probably enough for two to split as side.\n\nThe Cheezy Cajun seriously impressed me, y'all: the food portions are huge and the prices are outstanding. I have started judging places based on their location/price/food quality ratio. In other words- don't open a \"neighborhood\" place and charge $17 for a so-so burger. The Cheezy Cajun has perfected their location/price/food quality ratio. I would return in a heartbeat.",

  "text": "A great place for lunch on a nice sunny day, even when you're sitting inside. Met up with a few friends who live in the area and recommended the place. Slightly upscale Mexican food, meaning fresher ingredients and preparations, not the usual greasy combo plates (not that there's anything wrong with that--there is a time and place for all things). The portions are quite generous, also. I had the chicken mole tacos and they give you two huge tacos with a generous helping of sides. Quiet and well-heeled, it's not a place you go to to get all blotto on pitchers of margaritas and $1 tacos. The service could've been a bit more on it but everyone was very nice and friendly and we had a lovely time here. Definitely wouldn't mind hitting it up again in the future!",

Their breakfast is superb and for good reason.\n\nThe only drawback to this place is that it's not a secret (obviously) so the place is always packed and there is often a line out the door.  Though I've waited in this line and it didn't take very long, it's still not my favorite pass-time.  \n\nI have several other restaurants in Nashville that I prefer for breakfast, but that's not to bash the Pancake Pantry.  They've got so much more going on than just an alliteration in the name.",

  "text": "As I walked out from the baggage claim and saw the National van driving away from the stop, I was all set to slam them with a one star review. And then, not more than 2 minutes later, another National bus arrived and picked me up. Saved!\n\nA very bumpy ride, which might be bus quality and might be PHL paving quality, but we were at the parking lot shortly. And the first stop was at the Executive/Emerald elite row, where a long line of sparkly clean cars awaited, keys in the ignition and trunk lids up.\n\nAnd yes, since my last review there is now cover (or maybe I missed seeing it then). You can look at your car and even put your bags in the trunk without having to step into the rain. Awesome.\n\nChecking out is a speedy process once you actually get to the gatehouse, but if there's only one open and there were other people ahead of you, it can be a bit.\n\nTip: There's a Wawa not too far away from here. If you know that you're not going to have time to find it and get back, get the prepaid fuel option.",

As soon as we strolled in to this adorable bakery, all I could think was \"oh, I could spend hours at a table with my laptop and some tasty sweets on hand.\" \n\nWe tried the concord grape and avocado pops. If you're a sugar-lovin' person, go for the grape. The avocado is much more mild. The smell of baked goods in the air also led us to order a strawberry filled sugar cookie whoopie pie which was on the dry side but rockin' in the flavor department. I could have gone for a whole scoop of that filling. The pops were not the best we've ever encountered so I'm going to throw my chips into the baked goods next time.

  "text": "Pretty nice little place in the French Quarters of New Orleans. It's definitely a dive bar with one large bar in the middle surrounded with bar stools. \n\nThey have beers on the tap, bottle beers, and certainly mixed drinks.  However, their mixed drinks menu is not as big since the lack many of the ingredients. So basically just order the not so fancy simple drinks. And guess what we ordered...? Yep, more Vodka with Cranberry juice, and of course more beer. LOL.\n\nThe drinks are inexpensive. So we drank while watching the NBA basketball game (LA Clippers vs OKC Thunder). It was cool! The bartender was really accommodating. He was a nice guy. Yes, a bit light headed but fun!\n\nThis place is definitely a dive, and it's very chilled. You probably won't find a place like this in glamorous LA. Well, maybe around the hood. Ha! And for sure not around the Strip in Las Vegas.",

  "text": "I had plans for a tea date with my bestie when we both realized we were starving. What were we thinking, anyway, getting tea at noon on a Sunday? Clearly what we wanted was pizza. So pizza we had!\n\nFamoso wasn't that busy, surprisingly. Well, busy but not crazy. We snagged a high table, started gabbing, remembered that we were hungry, then went up to place our orders. I love the lunch-sized-pizza-and-soup combo, especially since their tomato bisque is one of my favourites in the city. I ordered up a soup-plus-pizza-with-some-fancy-Italian-name-combo and then we got back to the gabbing.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly, soup first, then pizza. It was nice and hot, and of course delicious. My pizza (a white pizza) came with arugula and prosciutto, yum! To be honest, it wasn't my favourite pie of all the ones I've tried, but I was still pretty satisfied. Don't even get me started on the soup. Yuuuuum.\n\nAnd last but not least, gelato for dessert. Bestie and I grew up eating lemon gelato and playing on the swing set in her backyard every summer, so it was only fitting that we both had lemon. While my hubby might make fun of me for only liking the most \"boring\" flavour of gelato on the planet, I prefer to consider myself a gelato purist. Either way: delicious.",

  "text": "This is one of my absolute favorite music venues in the entire city. In fact, Banks St. Bar is my second favorite music venue (number one is Saturn Bar, for the acoustics and \"balcony\" seating) in New Orleans. Every single time I've been here, I've seen an incredible show. Granted, I've only been to Banks St. Bar five or six times over the last few years, but every single time has been remarkable. \n\nMy first show was some sort of surf rock band. Since then, I've been to a live filming of a death metal concert (for some low budget film about, well, a death metal band), a gorgeous solo set by Micah McKee (of Silent Cinema/Empress Hotel/Little Maker), and a face melting show with local ska band Joystick (check them out) and a MS ska band called Stereohype (I'm determined to get them to move here, stay tuned). \n\nThere's also a pool table, and I guess people play it, but I use it to lean on when I need a rest from dancing my a*ss off. The bartender (pretty sure his name was Jim, and if not I totally suck) on my most recent visit was freaking awesome. Especially since I'm pretty sure I ordered at most one actual drink. The rest of the time I kept harassing him for ice water refills.\n\nAnother point worth noting: they carry blueberry Stoli. Yes, I'm the only person who cares about this, because that happens to be what I drink, but you're welcome for that bit of information. And, yes, now that you mention it, that would make an excellent list. Great idea!",

  "text": "I attended the soft opening for this new restaurant and bar. It's in the space that was formerly Epiphany Restaurant, and is under the same ownership and management. I guess they decided to go in a different direction and name.\n\nThe folks are the same, but the menu is different. Sort of fancy traditional American mixed with California cuisine. It's not just mac and cheese but truffle mac and cheese. \n\nThe soft opening was anything but! The doors opened at 6 and it was packed by 7. There is a good level of cougers and douchebags there, and HobNob appears to have anticipated that, and offer a signature drink called a Couger Cooler. \nWhat was soft about the opening was a limited menu, which they were very upfront about so we were well aware that the kitchen was still preparing and the staff was getting oriented. Parts of the restaurant were even still under construction.\n\nI was there with thirsty friends and we sampled three cocktails: the Hunny Sunshine (or sunset?), with muddled ginger , the Old Pom with bourbon and pomegranate syrup, and the Cucumber Crush with, you guessed it, crushed cucumber! Of these three, we liked the Old Pom and the Cucumber best. \n\nNibbles included a selection of bread rolls - rosemary, sundried tomato and plain - with a fat wodge of butter, and an appetizer order of the Mac Daddy, their spiral pasta with cheese sauce and toasted crumb topping flavored with truffle. \n\nThe guys at the bar, Andy and Ace, were kept on their toes with many many drink orders, they stayed organized and even added a little flourish here and there. \n\nDiners were young and old alike, and lots of them. Maybe they were old loyals of Epiphany, maybe they were seeking out the newest venues in town. Both probably got what they wanted!",

They assume that the majority of people really give a crap about sports.  I don't and I find it really distracting.  The Cheese in Cheeseburger must really mean CHEEEESY DECOR.  Seriously, fake hula skirts on the wait staff?  \n\nFOOD:  I almost didn't want to come here because I remember people saying they charged you for soda refills.  We were not, so they must have changed their policy.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  The meat itself was pretty good, but I didn't like that the bottom of the sandwich was soggy because of the cole slaw.  We also ordered onion rings as an appetizer which were excellent.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I came, but neither the food or ambiance did anything to scream \"Come back, Allie!\"",

  "text": "I have been driving passed Fellini's on West Chester Pike for some time now. Today I decided that it was time to stop by and have lunch here. The lunch prices are great, most meals average around $10. They offer a good selection of choices for lunch... pasta dishes, antipasto, salads, pizzas, paninis etc. I opted for a Panini- the \"El Patrizio\". Which consisted of grilled chicken, portobello mushrooms, spinach and provolone. When I think of a panini, I picture a sandwich all melted together with grill marks on the sides of the bread. This was more of just a normal sandwich on nice thick bread. It also came with lettuce, tomato and onions on it, which I was not aware came with the panini. The sandwich tasted good, just not what I had expected. It came with a side salad (great honey mustard dressing) and homemade chips (favorite part of my meal).  I left full and satisfied. I felt that I definitely got my moneys worth out of this meal. I would return!",

It's bright, it's gaudie with the cliche bull horns, wagon wheels lights and ugly tables. I almost bet myself that the salad dressing for my salad would come in a plastic container, as it did. So clearly ambiance is that of a school house cafeteria, or equivalent to one star.\n\nThe service, well there was only five people in the restaurant, so it was excellent, plastic containers and all. Are waitress was nice and efficient, she did say a party of fifty was expected.\n\nThe food: I had the thirty two oz Porterhouse and a sweet potatoe. The porterhouse was a work of grill master art. It was beyond good, cooked to perfection. You won't find that type of steak at any Morton's, Burn's or The Palm. Credit must go to where credit is due, I tip my hat. The sweet potatoe, eeeehhh not so much.\n\nWould I go back, yes definaty. Would I take a date, no not a chance. Would I take my wife of I were married, sure. Why, no one to impress.

  "text": "We were led here by the glowing Yelp reviews and the fact that we had a wonderful meal at Mad Fish last year (owned by the same person as 1200). What a mistake.\n\nFirst off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip\nOrdered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.\n\nWhen Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.\n\nWhen we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.\n\nI should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.\n\nAvoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",

  "text": "4-star beer, 5-star ambiance. This is the most impressive and promising brewery in Santa Barbara. \n\nInside they have a high ceiling, exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list. It looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels, which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like IBUs, ABV, style, volume poured. The list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours, Berliners, stouts, pilsners, and IPAs.\n\nThey offer very nice tasting flights, which our group did. You grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try. This system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process - a great idea. The beer quality was a bit all over the place, which is expected from a new brewery. However, some showed a lot of promise and I think Third Window has what it takes to improve their recipes. Detailed notes are below. I ended up liking their pilsner, The Light, the best and got it in a large format mug pour. \n\nPretzels and popcorn are available, which is a nice touch. Dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nExtra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery:\n\nThe Light 1.1\nThis was an outstanding German style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness. Hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated. The flavor was dry and a tad powdery, but the finish was neutral and refreshing. This was my absolute favorite of the beers I tried so I got a large pour in a giant mug. \n\nBrett Saison\nLooking beautiful in the glass, glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation. The aroma is sawdust, barn, candied mango. The flavor is bubbly, neautral, and very dry but not abrasive. Refreshing, though a tad washed out in the flavor.\n\nRakau Welch\nLooking identical to the Brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits, lemongrass, dill, fennel, oregano - super herbal. The flavor is dry, neutral, refreshing. The farmyard character of saison is spot on here. Simple, dry, but not abrasive.\n\nXexo\nSuper dry for an IPA that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor, but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive. Needed some work. \n\nThe ÖKO BOMB\nInky black in color, but much too thin a body for stout. The nose is savory chocolate mousse, big raisin, chocolate covered raisin. But the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda, grape cough syrup and tootsie roll.\n\nExecutioner's Daughter\nClear amber in color. This one had intense vinegar (acetic acid) and nail polish remover (ethyl acetate) in the nose. Taste is very nice, however, with cinnamon, mild sugar, dark bread, banana nut bran muffin. Great mouthfeel.\n\nThe Origin 2016\nThis was billed as a dry-hopped APA, but the aroma was sticky with thick caramel and butterscotch. The flavor was watery and bland. Overall, it seemed dead and not what was intended.",

Some highlights from this year (opened in May, I think):\n\nDaily Loaf :  organic flaxseeds and whole-grain flour\n\nMarliscious: the pistachio torte cake is 3 fantastics layers of pistachio cake sandwiched between and enrobed in a pistachio-filled cream.  I have not found a pistachio cake anywhere else and this is just delicious.  The Prinzregententorte is amazing to even look at, with 8+ layers of super-thin sponge cake layered with chocolate cream and covered in a thin chocolate coating; it's very good and has just the right amount of sweetness.  She doesn't always have every cake every time, but you can always order a particular flavor.  \n \nFarm Fromage: creamy, organic goat cheese - it's delicious paired with a spring mix salad and glazed walnuts.\n \nFrecon Farms: hard cider.  need I say more?\n \nJimmies Cupcake Co.: James Taylor/Boston cream cupcake with a custard filling, vanilla cake, and chocolate frosting.  Personally, I just like the names.  Cupcakes taste pretty good, too, but aren't as fantastic as House of Cupcake's in Pton.\n \nLivengood Family Farm - grass fed ground sirloin - makes REALLY good, tender burgers\n \nMacDougall's Irish Victory Cake: You HAVE to try the sweet butter cake!  It's rich, buttery, and full of simple, delicious goodness.  They have other varieties but this is the traditional tried-and-true, and, in my opinion, the best.\n\nDefinitely stop by if you live in the area and don't feel like driving down to Reading or Ardmore for your farmer's market goods.  I only wish that they had more prepared foods and snacks, like sandwiches and roasted meats.",

The menu was interesting since they offer other kinds of fruit bowls in addition to the traditional acai bows and smoothies. I decided to be creative and ordered the kale bowl which was blended with fruit and came with granola and honey on top. My BF ordered smarter and got the beach bowl which is one of their best sellers and added peanut butter for an extra charge. Note that the toppings cost extra here which explains why the bowls are more affordable at $7.95 each. I have to stay... my kale bowl was watery and lacked flavor. I also didn't love the granola they used. I wondered if my error came from ordering kale, but I tasted my BF's best seller and it definitely wasn't up to par with Juice Nashville or Franklin Juice Company. Both were quite bland and seemed to be more ice than fruit. \nI was starving and it was a good sized bowl, especially for the price, but I have to say that it left much to be desired. I'll probably give them a few months before giving them a second chance.",

  "text": "On a cold Friday, we took our fat selves to Fat Ham, some ordered Fat Apples, and we left feeling FAT...and happy.\n\nSERVICE\n...was amazing. It was like one of those Hindu goddesses was bringing all the dishes, whisking them away when done, and a constant flow of deliciousness on our table. We were seated near Ben, the Manager, who was very helpful in giving advice about what to order. He must have also been entertained by our having memorized the menu, or me obnoxiously taking pictures and (surprise!) decided to send out a few extra dishes (BEST NIGHT EVER). Or maybe it was because we couldn't get a res until 9:45(!) and they needed to unload some food? Don't know, don't care. \n\nFOOD\n-Full disclosure-I'm not a huge huge fan of Southern food, but I'm a fan of good food. This was all good. Here are the highlights:\n-Charcuterie plate-the chicken liver was the standout food of the night (even to my friend the diehard liver hater).\n-The Carolina Gold Rice was the dark horse winner of our affections. Get it.\n-Hummus-smooth with a delicious peanuty aftertaste.\n-The Hot Chicken came highly recommended and although delicious-was a bit too spicy for me to enjoy without needing water to breathe. (Like Handy Nasty level 8 spicy).\n-Pork Belly and Pulled Pork-both delicious and would recommend ordering.\n-Mustard Greens and Roasted Root Veggies- very good, and nice to have something fresh on the table.\n\nDRANKS\n- The Fat Apple was delicious but barely tasted boozy-good thing? dangerous thing? \n-The Blackberry cocktail was VERY strong. but very good.\n-Large selection of whiskey and beers. Reasonably priced for what you're getting, but watch out if you're ordering more than one cocktail, at $10 a piece they could easily double your bill.\n\nAMBIANCE (http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/web05/2012/4/19/12/enhanced-buzz-3258-1334853666-7.jpg) \n-Great for a date, friends, special occasion, random dinner, anything really. It's upscale without being pretentious, cozy without being annoying, and lively without being too loud. \n-We had an amazing time laughing, drinking, eating, pretending to have southern accents, (fat) hamming it up, more drinking. I never felt like we were being rushed out or annoying, even though we were probably very annoying.\n-Definitely recommend sharing plates to try more things\n\nSPARKNOTES: Good food, delicious drinks, amazing service, great addition to the Philly restaurant scene and hope this place lasts! Go make a reservation now, thank me later.",

  "text": "La Madeleine has a nice covered outside area that is great on a day that's not too hot. This cafe is cafeteria style where you order at the different stations in the line. Some items like soup are given to you immediately and others you reserve a numbered wood block do and they bring it to you. 4 stars might be slightly high for this location. \n\nThe soups are good: tomato basil, mushroom, French onion, potato and usually a seasonal vegetable offering. You can get a cup, bowl or now they have a large. Soup and their complimentary bread (with butter and exceptional blackberry jam) makes for a great modestly priced lunch. Their sandwiches and salads are good and made to order. The seasoned chicken is moist and flavorful and available on several different salads and sandwiches. They have a hot plate with already cooked French decadent items like croque monsieur, potato galette and quiches. These are sometimes good and sometimes a little dried out from being on the hot plate. I recommend the fresh made sandwiches instead as a better bet. \n\nThere is also a small bakery section with some tempting bread and sweets options. The coconut cake is really good as are the tarts. \n\nBreakfast options are good too such as a croissant sandwich amply filled with ham, egg, cheese and tomato. Really good and rather large. Coffee drinks are well done here as well. \n\nThey have some dinner/entree options that are good. The salmon with green beans and a modest dill sauce is simple and lovely.",

  "text": "Definitely a fan of this place, Citizens Bank Park.  I like the arena itself. I am a mets and former fan of the evil empire, Yankees, so I don't know if me and most Philly fans get along.  I had the best time here though before in the two games I visited.  It was a on the whim drive here from NY to catch a sunday night baseball Nationally televised game BRAVES-PHILLIES.  Seats were a lot cheap than both citified and yankee stadium and the drive home that late at night was not that bad.\n\nI recommend a visit here if you are in the area. Great food and great views of the field from almost any seat.  Another cool fact about this philly arena is that the other team stadium are right there, PRETTY much on the same block.  IT is like if in New York, we had madison square garden, giants stadium and citified all lined up next to each other basically a three block radius.  I thought that was pretty cool.  cHECK out Citzens Bank Park at least once, even if you have to root for the other team and hopeful avoid getting in some fistfights.",

This is a nice spot to grab a quick drink right off Bourbon Street when you are on your way to or from dinner or some other activity in the Quarter.  I've never seen it unpleasantly crowded here so it seems to be a reliable spot to have an enjoyable experience with breathing room and a sound level appropriate to have a proper conversation.",

  "text": "This taco joint is highly rated on yelp so I gave it a try last night for the first time. I was a bit disappointed in my selections, maybe some of the other menu options were better but I wasn't thrilled with what I chose. When you come in, you place an order and pay, then they bring the food to the table for you. It isnt a full wait service, something inbetween since you do help yourself to beverages and condiments etc. There have a wide selection of bottled beers, as well as margaritas and mixed drinks. I had read a review stating the margs were $3, but they were $5.95 last night and I didnt see any advertisement for happy hour or anything for the weekdays-which was a disappointment.\n\nAll the tacos are soft shell only, which I guess is more authentic, but not what I prefer. I did the daily special which was a chicken verde and also did a bean/vegetarian taco. The chicken taco was overcooked and dry, and the tortilla was wet and soggy from the verde sauce, which I did not like. The ingredients seemed fresh but overall it was just not working for me. The bean taco was much better but still left something to be wanted.\n\nI will say the the chips/guac/queso we ordered was awesome so thats a 5 star in my book but not enought to make me want to go back for food. if they had a happy hour I think it would be a fun place to hangout with friends for a drink and some chips.",

Sourdough bread was not good either, no butter present and all they give is one portion of jam.\n\nMaybe I will try again but after this experience I truly doubt I would go for the food, I would for a nice cup of coffee and people watch and just relax and enjoy the beach and ocean view.",

Plus, they carry half sizes through women's size 11!  Not something I can find everywhere.  And, they have a railed rock where you can try the shoes two steps up and down steep terrain.  \n\nI tried on at least a half a dozen pairs of shoes and they never seemed the slightest bit impatient with me.  In fact, they were the complete opposite--happily helpful the entire time.\n\nI don't shop at REI frequently, but having a look around--I think that will change.  They have a pretty sweet women's clothing section with great workout and outdoor adventuring clothes.  Oh!  And, I scored a pretty sweet sun hat for all the training hikes (as well as the big day on half dome).  Awesome!\n\nGet to it!",

You will find more local patrons rather than tourists dwelling here. It is also opened 24/7. I was told it has been opened almost as long as Cafe Du Monde and that it's original location use to be down the street from them. It's a nice change of pace from the rush you get from the French Quarters.\n\nThe beignets here contain a bit more dough and are definitely thicker. They don't automatically dump the powdered sugar for you. They have it on each table and you do it yourself.\n\nThe prices here are about the same as their competitors. It's more of a chilled out spot. The people here are leisurely browsing their laptops, newspaper, and just conversing in their own world.\n\nIf you want to avoid the mayhem at the other beignet spot, then come here or if you're in the area. It's much more relaxed but you'll notice a difference in taste and texture (which also includes the cafe au lait).",

I've never seen anyone get so excited about food and discuss the ingredients in such detail with so much passion.  The food really was different and had unbelievable flavor.  Anyone who calls themselves a foodie should try this place.  I'm thinking they would be pleased with this place.  But, the portions were small.  And I really didn't like the interior of the restaurant.  I'm more of a booths girl.  Booths can be classy, you know?  All in all, I would say this was an interesting place and I would come back, but the dishes were too complicated for me to want to come back beyond once a year.  Speaking of timing, the chefs change the menu every year.  And these guys really are good at what they do.  The owners actually own the Red Pony and two other restaurants all on the same street!

I stopped here for ribs on memorial day which should be the crown jewel for bbq places and I swear I could have thrown the whole plate away. The ribs had a 13 degree burn though surprisingly still juicy but no taste to them at all except for the smoke flavor. I asked for sauce and they bring you a thimble of some can sauce when they used to have very spicy flavorful ribs and a great sauce to go with them. In fact the ribs were so flavorful you didn't need sauce. This is twice now that I have been and been disappointed which probably means I will never go again. Not to mention  the sides that were never that great were even worse than before. Lightly boiled greens with no taste and the worst cole-slaw I have ever had. As I walk out I was not the only unsatisfied customer. This place does not have a long life left I think.",

The menu is quite large here and fortunately most things I've eaten from Nirvana have been on the tasty side. My latest meal began with the well known Punjabi dish - Fish Amritsari.  This was done just right.  My main course went to the south of India as I ordered a Kerala pepper chicken.  Again I was pleased although the predominant sauce it was cooked in seemed remarkably similar to sauces used in many Indian dishes from other parts of India.  Anyway, the service is especially friendly here - the staff seem to already know most of the people dining here which is a good sign of repeat business.  If you're heading to the Plymouth Meeting area, keep Nurvana Indian Bistro in mind.",

  "text": "If you like quality food, then you will like Turchetti's!  I went to the grand opening and was fortunate to get there just before the lunch rush.  It's located within the former \"Marrow\" space, so parking is limited to street parking in the area.\n\nInside, there is a window processing area at the front, and once you get into the main area, the order counter/cooler/bar are on the left side; the two-top tables are in the middle; and the 4-top tables are on the right with the curing meats in a windowed room beyond those.\n\nWhile waiting to place my order, I noticed the menu boards for sandwiches, burgers, and sides posted above the cooler filled with packaged meats to go.  I picked up a pack of beef franks and one of beef summer sausage.  \n\nI was welcomed by the cashier who explained a few things to help make the visit informed.  I started with a double order of N'Duja Deviled Eggs (they come as half eggs) and went with the Pastrami (Reuben).  They also have a variety of beverages including Pepsi products, sparkling water, and a few beer selections.\n\nAfter paying, they gave me a card to place on my table so that the server could bring out my order.\n\nAfter a brief wait, the eggs were delivered.  Wow! The flavor was great.  I ate each half like it was an amuse bouche.  The yolks were flavored and though I can't tell you all the ingredients, the creamy texture and the light bite of the egg white added to the layered flavor (definitely an hint of vinegar & mustard seed).  They aren't filling and are worth a taste.\n\nThe Pastrami was delivered soon after and was excellent!  The rye was lightly crisped for that satisfying crunch.  Inside, they have the pastrami layered with Swiss cheese and \"gardenkraut\" topping and a bit of 1000 Island dressing for more flavor.  Simply delicious and it paired well with my Central State IPA.  \n\nThe only negative I had was that the place was getting quite busy since it was opening day and the line was backing up.  I think once the cashier doesn't have to take time to answer a lot of questions about the place due to all the new customers, things out to go more quickly.  Still, the line was moving pretty well while I was there...maybe 5 minutes from door to placing your order.\n\nReview #1265",

  "text": "I must have missed the memo.  When did Chili's get much better?  I haven't been in a Chili's in years and begrudgingly went to dinner here.  I was surprised to see a nice, modern looking restaurant.  All of the tchotchkes hanging from the wall/ceiling (ala Cracker Barrell) I'm used to seeing at Chili's were gone and the place looked really nice.  They had a special that we happily took advantage of.  For $20 two people can split an appetizer (hello bottomless chips and salsa!) and then each get a full-sized entree.  That is one good deal and the food wasn't half bad either!  The most impressive thing to me were the touchscreen units that were present on each table.  It's so annoying when you are done with your meal and want to leave but can't because you either haven't gotten the bill or the server hasn't come back with your credit card.  When we were ready to go I was able to swipe my credit card in the unit, select a tip amount, and get a printed receipt.  It couldn't have been faster or more efficient.  The touchscreens also can serve as a distraction for your children.  For a buck you can let them play Peggle, Bejeweled, etc.  Sure you could argue that you could just buy those games on your phone for a dollar, but your phone isn't tied up while the kids are playing.  I think it's brilliant!  This was a surprisingly good experience.",

  "text": "Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!  I have a new favorite restaurant in town and Home Wine Kitchen is IT.  The schiznIT, in fact.\n\nWe celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.\n\nWe were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!\n\nSince it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.\n\nI couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, \"You have to try this NOW!\"  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.\n\nThe heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.\n\nJustin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.\n\nI had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.\n\nI was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)\n\nI enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.  I absolutely cannot wait to head back for more fabulous food and support this new restaurant!",

He was friendly, patient, and knowledgeable of Santa Barbara and in the Christmas spirit.  He kept us on track and took us on a great Christmas Lights Tour.    \n\nThis tour was a new experience for me and it was fantastic.  I was impressed with how organized it was.  The bus arrived at Reds Bin 211 on time.   The layout inside the bus was designed for large groups to face one another with a couple of double sets in the back and front of the bus.  The bus was clean and in great condition.  \n\nThey also do other types of tours so if you are planning a bus tour event be sure to check them out.",

A huge plus was the non-smoking hotel that doesn't allow smoking throughout. Attentive service and wonderful experience. Great ambiance and decor as i loved the courtyard fountain area at night to just relax after a day in NOLA. Bathrooms were a bit small and the shower could of used a door as water splashed out to the main area but overall it was a comfy room. Free wifi and the staff service was impeccable. We had a fuse blown and the repair was done in 15 min. after we called it in. Another plus is the free bottled water everyday as they gave us 2 bottles on the dresser along with 2 in the fridge. Highly recommended for a stay in the French quarter.",

It annoys me a bit because most of the restaurants in Dunedin are. \n\nThey have a nice size outside covered shaded patio. Come on Kelly's bring it back. Most pet owners are 200% responsible. (I really hate how the irresponsible pet owners kill it for the rest of us.)\n\nThis time around we came for my pre-birthday celebration. I was excited that they accepted reservations, and having a bigger group was done with ease. Make sure u do ask if the fan works. We got the section that did not. \n\nSince we were in the group section, it was super loud. It was everyone's birthday so it was super fitting.\n\nOur waitress was pretty good considering how busy it was.  \n\nFor food, it was difficult for me to choose. I wanted a fish entree they had on special, it was gone. Many of what they had for options had tons of carbs, which I really wanted to lay off on. My hubby and a handful of the group had the espresso rubbed steak and loved it. Of course, my hubby always says get something diff. \n\nI'm not listening to him next time. I chose the beef tenderloin app and ahi tuna. I liked the ahi tuna better.\n\nMy birthday cake was a nice cherry on top that I split with the rest of the group.\n\nI didn't get a drink this time around. I did try my friend's drink which was hella strong.\n\nAll in all, I'm blessed to have great friends that make my night perfect as can be.",

  "text": "The service here is spectacular.  After we parked along the street nearby, I went in to ask if we could sit out on the patio and although the hostess was not spotted, I saw two staffers chatting at the bar area who immediately spotted me, so I asked them about sitting on the patio.  One of them said we could and apologized about not being up front at the restaurant when I walked in, which was totally fine with us.  He was very, very nice and allowed us to pick a table outside and got us menus before our server came out, which was shortly after.  And with the great service - our server was very nice and checked in with us about getting refills, getting more beers, bringing anything else, etc...  She also was well-informed about the menu when we would ask for specifics on items.\n\nUnfortunately though, I didn't like my burger as much as I had hoped.  I ordered the Taco Truck Burger, which came with guac, sour cream and tortilla chips on a burger, so sounded amazing!  But it wasn't something I'd order again, as I thought it was very bland - even with all of the jazzed up toppings.  It didn't taste like the patty was seasoned at all nor the guac, which was odd.  The sweet potato tots though were yummy.  I do like that instead of fries you can get tots, especially sweet potato tots.  I recommend getting the sweet potato tots with the garlic aioli that the server recommended for me when I asked if she could bring me an aioli to go with.  I just wished the burger had been more to my liking.  \n\nThey have some local beers on taps, and most are from the east coast.  Patio seating was spacious, looking out to the street/Gulch area and they have heated outdoor lamps there.",

  "text": "Yes, this certainly can be considered a tourist trap. However I am still a fan( just barely) This is a large farm and country store that features various pick your own options depending on the season. For the fall that means pumpkins and apples. \n\nMy biggest qualm with this place is that there is no difference in price between pick your own or those items picked up in the store. And you have to pay for a tractor ride out to the fields($4.00) Would it kill them to deduct the fee from your purchase? Anyway, we did it for the experience and it was fun, and from the children we encountered, they were enjoying it too. But at .79 a lb for pumpkins, you would save mucho dinero by purchasing them from your local supermarket( who most likely also buys them from this farm at much cheaper costs)\n\nWhile on the hayride you also have an option to pick apples. Again, same cost inside the store, and the apples on the tree are huge. Think of the  chocolate covered monsters you see at the holidays and you are getting close. \n\nThe store boasts many varieties of baked goods. From these we sampled a pumpkin blondie that was incredible. There are also sandwiches, salads, snack foods and take home dinners to name just a few. Some of these food options are also available outside on busy weekend days. You can tell that much thought has gone into maximizing commercial viability. There are other activities for children here including a petting zoo, corn maze and other farm like displays. Most of these activities carry fees also.\n\nOverall I am thrilled that this farm is thriving. Places like this can connect us to the land, and provide children with their first glimpses of where our food really comes from. But I can't help but imagine that a generation ago this operation would not be so commercialized. And I really hope that this trend does not continue to worsen. Because if it does it could exclude those who may appreciate and need it the most. 4 pumpkin spiced Yelps",

  "text": "The Alteration Center is a unique place. It is located in a strip mall right off of Belle Chasse Hwy, but isn't very easy to find.\n\nAs you walk in several ladies are sitting behind some very old looking sewing machines. I have come here numerous times to have work clothes altered and have sent many people here for work as well.\n\nThat being said, my luck has been hit or miss. On my last trip I needed some pants hemmed. I told them the length to make them, but they insisted I try them on and have them measure. That was fine, but the changing area was tiny and the curtain didn't close all the way. That didn't really bother me, but if I were a lady, I wouldn't want some cheesy dude leering at me if I were in there. Granted there aren't too many dudes in this place, but it does bear mentioning.\n\nAnyway, I get measured and hand over my three pairs of pants. A few days later they were ready. The pants were all wrong. The hem was far too long so I went back. Then when I picked them up two were the same length (too short) and the other was still too long. My suggestion is to ensure you try on everything before leaving.\n\nThis was the only time I had issues, and this is one of the only alteration shops I know of on the WB. If you need something altered, give these ladies a try.",

From their waffle fries to their chicken and waffles - Twisted Iron has always whipped out some tasty food truck eats that are both unique and delicious. I was really happy to see them out and about after Tampa Luv Chicken's unfortunate ending.\n\nAlthough I'm not originally from Tampa, I would say my taste for fried chicken and waffles is probably the most Southern thing about me and Twisted Iron delivers. The owners are young and friendly - clearly passionate about their food. Prices average $6-$10 which is standard for food truck food.\n\nThe actual food truck itself is modern with a clean wrap and mostly visible interior. I'm not much of a dessert guy - but I do like waffle dessert choices that are offered by Twisted Iron.\n\nShoutout to Anna M. for sharing some of her pulled pork waffle fries with me today at the food court - they were delicious and hit the spot! I hope to see Twisted Iron around soon with some new creations.",

  "text": "Came down to 40th Street to meet a good friend, and parked right in front of Tandoor India.  When he arrived, I asked where he wanted to go, and he pointed to the doorway right behind me.  Auspicious beginnings...\nFirst impression was of an old establishment somewhat in need of refurbishment, but with inviting scents of curry and coriander drawing us in.  I checked the buffet as we walked past to our table and saw an extensive collection of yellow, red, brown and rusty sauces, all looking fresh and inviting on a cold Sunday night.  The place was not crowded.  Settling in, I decided to take a look at the menu because I was not in the mood for a cascade of flavors and tastes, but wanted to relax with only a few.  We were given copies of the take out menu, which somewhat surprised me.  On the cover it said: \"We believe that the joy of eating lies in the art of fine cooking.\"\nI'll drink to that.\nWe ordered Tikka Masala (with Chicken), which came out in a fine pink sauce of tomato and ginger, and was quite good. The Baigan Bharta was tasty, but was chopped fine rather than with the chunky eggplant I expected.  They cheated a bit on the Garlic Naan by bringing us regular Naan painted with garlic butter.  It didn't work, as it was not integrated into the bread, but sat on the surface, and lacked the baked garlic pieces I love in true Garlic Naan.  A disappointing way to pay an extra buck. The Mango Lassi was pretty good,  but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt.  A nice plate of rice came with the meal.  \nThis was a meal in which we were more engrossed in the conversation than attentive to our food.  The strong brotherhood carried the day, and the meal became background.  For the overall experience, I was quite satisfied.\nWe didn't solve any world problems, but agreed we would get together soon, and try again.",

  "text": "Bailey's Chocolate Bar moved upstairs and Dave Bailey transformed this space into an entirely new experience. Having recently been to New Orleans, I can tell you the decor is very similar to the trendy & chic little restaurants in the French Quarter. I cannot wait till spring to enjoy the outside dining. \n\nMy dining partner and I started off sharing, a Lump Crab Cake, Blackened Shrimp and a Cornmeal Waffle. My favorite was the Blackened Shrimp that came with a Cucumber Ranch. I tried it, it was cool and refreshing, but I ate my shrimp without it. The spicy flavor, was reminiscent of the cajun seasoning I experienced in NOLA. My DP, favored the Crab Cake. It was topped with slices of grapefruit and avocado. Make sure you get a mixture of all three in every bite. It makes for an interesting combination on your palate. \n\nOur Cornmeal Waffle was a tad cold, so we sent it back. The second one was warm and served with a large scoop of soft whipped butter. I enjoyed the texture of the cornmeal and the taste, but would have preferred some other type of topping in addition to the butter. Perhaps, a little cup of syrup. After all, it is a waffle. \n\nWe went in different directions on our entrees so we could each sample each others. Being a fan of catfish, I choose the Crab Stuffed Missouri Catfish. It was served on a bed of poblano grits and topped with a garlic dressing. You can not go wrong with crab and catfish in the same dish. \nIt's amazing how the older I get, the more I am developing an appreciation for grits. These were some of the best I have had. \n\nThe DP went with the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp were the same as the Blackened Shrimp we enjoyed as an appetizer. She liked them. They were hard to photograph in a dimly light bar, so trust us when we say they tasted better then they photographed. \n\nBeing a bar diner, I was highly impressed with the comfort and style of the barstools. The back was low, giving good back support and they had armrest for extra comfort. Only thing lacking at the bar was hooks underneath for ladies to secure their purses and outlets to allow social media junkies to keep charged up. \n\nNathan was a great bar host and mixologist. He's a transplant from Tulsa and is adjusting to new city very well. Stop by and welcome him to STL. \n\nWill I return? - I hang out in Lafayette Square - so, YES!\n\nWhen: December 28, 2017\nWhy: It's new, hot and trendy. You should go, too.",

  "text": "Despite the fact it's part of a small chain, many locals consider this the best steakhouse in town. Located in the Warwick Hotel, it's certainly one of the most glamorous - leopard-print carpeting, black leather furniture, black-lacquer walls trimmed in gold, and nightly jazz piano and bass duets give it a very 1940s-supper-club ambiance, albeit one that's overlit. The menu is typical - a variety of steaks, chops, salmon, and - of course - prime rib, served in enormous portions along with the usual suspects of sides, like rich creamed spinach and excellent potato skins. If you have any room left, end your meal with fresh strawberries and cream over warm shortbread. The servers will pamper you like few do. Hoping to maintain a touch of class, they require jackets for men at night. If you forget yours, they'll loan you one, although why a man in a well-worn, ill-fitting blazer would look better than one without is beyond me.",

Their pizza is just *that* good.\n\nI grew up in Maryland, and whenever our family got pizza, it was from Ledo's.  After driving by this location on Dale Mabry multiple times, and laughing at the coincidence of a pizza place using the same name as my favorite place in MD, I looked it up online and realized it IS the same place.  Woo hoo!  I've been here three times now, and the pizza is just like I remembered, and just as good as I hoped it would be.\n\nTo start with - the pizza is square, and the pieces are cut into little squares.  It's thin crust, which is my favorite kind of pizza, as I hate filling up on dough.  The red sauce is sweet, and very distinctive.  I've tried all different varieties of pizza here, but I always come back to the classic pepperoni pizza.  Each individual square piece of pizza gets it own thick cut slice of pepperoni on top.  Heaven!  Then, before you know it, you've eaten multiple squares, and you roll out the door, fat and happy.\n\nService was good, waitress was friendly, and stopped by frequently to make sure we had what we needed.  I do wish they supplied better quality paper napkins, as I went through about 1 per slice, but at least they are on the table to grab as many as you need.

  "text": "If you are looking for fine Italian dining with a full bar in the Western suburbs, this is a solid choice.\n\nI'm going to get the two negatives out of the way first so I can focus on the many positives.\n\nThe lovely wife and I had 8:15 OpenTable reservations on a recent Saturday.  Parking was INSANE!  The closest public lot was full. Uggggh.  We just barely parked in the next closest lot and had to hoof it a couple of blocks. \n\nWhen we opened the door to the restaurant we were greeted by a blast of noise. Once again the word I would use is INSANE.  The front bar was three deep and there were boat loads of folks waiting for tables.  Thank God for OpenTable as our table was waiting for us.  Just to be clear, the noise level was through the roof!\n\nNote to self- Visit on a weekday night!\n\nOur waiter was Bill and he was beyond superb.  How is this for an opening sentence- \"I'm here to exceed your expectations!\"  I have visited restaurants with Michelin stars and experienced lesser service.  Kudos to the management\n\nThe menu here is extensive and it's hard to believe it couldn't satisfy almost everyone.  We ordered the antipasto plate.  We consider ourselves experts with Antipasto/Charcuterie plates and this one was up there with the best we have ever experienced.  The accompaniments were numerous and delicious.\n\nFor entrees I ordered the Braised Shortrib Ravioli ($19) and the lovely wife ordered the Hanger Steak special. Both dishes were an easy four stars.\n\nSo what was the tab? Complimentary bruschetta, an excellent antipasto plate, two entrees, four drinks and of course complimentary Limoncello shots to end our fine meal equaled $100.  For us this was a solid value.\n\nI'd visit here again in a heartbeat but only on a weekday night!",

You have to travel a bit to get to your room, which involves waiting for very slow elevators each time.  The rooms were ok, but the walls were paper thin, you could hear doors opening and closing and talking in the hallways all night.  I also had to listen to the people in the room next to me \"making love\" - that was very loud as well.  Oh joy.  \n\nTried to get out of the parking lot the next day took about $20 min, card was not coded and had to pay $21 for parking.",

  "text": "This just became my go-to breakfast spot in the valley.  \n\nTruly.\n\nFirst bit of fabulousness:  Upon being seated, I ordered coffee.  To which, my server responded, \"Sure...we have a house roast, dark roast, or a vanilla flavored?\"\n\nAre you kidding me?  A breakfast place with coffee OPTIONS?  And, one of those options is DARK roast?  Color me caffeinated.  I promptly ordered their dark roast which came poured out of a carafe left at the table.  Plus, they have flavored creamer (bonus!).  This was definitely not your usual (awful) diner coffee.  It was dark and delicious.\n\nFortunately, my dining companions were familiar with the menu and HIGHLY recommended the Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Always a fan of anything including hollandaise sauce--I went for it.  My people!  Perfection.  Here's the thing, when you smother something in hollandaise, you can easily be lazy in the preparation of what comes UNDERNEATH the hollandaise.  I mean, it's going to be smothered in all that lovely, buttery deliciousness--who will notice?  I will notice, people.  I will.  And, there was definitely nothing lackadaisical about the preparation of this dish.  The salmon, even without the hollandaise, was moist and flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly, beautifully, delicately poached.  It was the single best Salmon Benedict I've ever consumed (possibly the best Eggs Benedict in general!).  \n\nThe Benedict came with a side of home fried potatoes, which had a light peppery flavor that I quite enjoyed.  The service was spot on--prompt, attentive, and friendly.\n\nOne final note I have is the menu:  The menu is expansive.  If you have family and/or friends in town with diverse tastes--this is a wonderful option for breakfast.  They have all your classic selections covered (bacon & eggs, chicken fried steak, various scrambles).  They have the sweet (pancakes, stuffed french toast, waffles, crepes).  And, they've got your savory (An entire list of various Benedicts, skillets, and classic to creative omelets).  I can't imagine anyone NOT finding something they'd enjoy.\n\nPlus, I was informed they have an entire gluten free menu.  Not merely the slight modification of items on their regular menu--but an entire menu of creative gluten free options.\n\nGet to it!",

Although it's not my favorite hotel in the chain, I really did enjoy my stay here and made the most of the pool, the happy hours and the location.\n\nI love to swim, so rain or shine ~ I was pool side suntanning and cooling off in the water. I worked out in the gym beside the pool almost everyday and had it all to myself. \n\nThe Happy Hour Reception was nice, the kitchen switched up the daily snacks and drink choices. The Sangria was good too. The morning breakfast is pretty typical, but has a larger selection than usual. \n\nThe shuttle drivers not only pick you up and drop you off at the airport, they can take you to local restaurants and activities. We really saved a lot in cab fare and learned about new places from the shuttle drivers. \n\nI loved that it was located right across the street from the mall and nice restaurants like Seasons 52 and Mitchell's Fish Market.

Philadelphians love to eat and they pack that weight on in/around the ass and chest area from what I can tell.  These seats were designed for the large man.  We had a TON of leg room in front of us as well as to the side.  These were some of the best seats I have ever sat in at a stadium.  And they weren't \"club\" section tickets or anything like that.  Concessions were good.  Had a Philadelphia Mango Water Ice which was refreshing and delicious.  They also had a nice team store where I picked up a hat and a bat.  Ushers were friendly and the fans come out in full support wearing their Phillies gear. \n\nWe had a great time in the City of Brotherly Love!",

For those of us raised near ethnic supermarkets and shops, having Wei Hong across the street from Jay Intl Market gives you access to 65-75% of the things you are looking for when living in Asia, and that's really cool.\n\nIf you really like Chinese food (and no, if you eat a lot of Orange Chicken, Broccoli/Beef, and crab rangoon, I'm not talking to you.  That would be like saying that liking Taco Bell meant you liked Mexican food.  Kinda, but not really) this is the place for you.\n\nAs I've mentioned in other reviews of Asian places, \"American style\" customer service is very rare in an authentic place.  Indeed, there's probably an inverse proportion - the ruder the staff is, the better the food might be.  Every now and then you run into an Asian or ethnic place where the service is awesome and the food is awesome.  For me, when I go for great ethnic food the service is really secondary.",

The sign outside reads Hamilton East Public Library, so I'm going with that!\n\nThis library has a gigantic children's area. What I like about it is that there are pockets of fun stuff to do all around the children's area -- it's not just in one space. In one nook, there is a little kitchen and puzzles. In another corner, there are magnetic pipe pieces on the wall that you can move around and use to make balls travel from one side to the other. In another area, there is a diorama of a town (I'm thinking it's Fishers?). In another area, there is a display case with local student art -- when we visited, it was Lego creations. Then, there is a huge, open, bright room with lots of toys. This is where the librarians have story time. When we visited, story time was happening so we couldn't play with all of the toys -- it would have disrupted the scene. This is the one bad thing about this area: you can't have all of the toys in an area and not let the kids play with them! Oh well. \n\nThere are lots of books and movies here, too. But when you come here with children who are like 5 years of age or younger, books and movies are secondary to playing.\n\nJust outside of the children's area is a space with tables and a vending machine where you can grab a snack.",

The restaurant was very stylish yet inviting.  \n  We also had great service with a combination of friendliness and knowledge that I wish more restaurants had.  After all, the social aspect of dining with friends can be as key to enjoying the evening as the food.\n  After ordering our beverages, we were brought a small cup of Sancocho as an amuse bouche.  I am not familiar with the item, but the flavor reminded me of tasty bean broth.  \n  We then shared a guacamole for the table.  Excellent flavor combination in the guac.  My wife, who normally doesn't care for avocado, even thought it was good!  The chips that came with the guac were light, but crisp enough to scoop.\n  I ordered the \"De Palmitos\" salad (hearts of palm, field greens, roasted walnuts, butternut squash, hibiscus-lemon vinaigrette).  It was my first time trying hearts of palm, so having all these other delicious flavors gave me confidence to try something new.  I was very pleased.\n  Finally, I ordered the Pescado Zarandeado (it comes without the fish head....I asked.)  The sea bass was colored/flavored with green and red achiote which made for a nice presentation.  Very tasty.  The fish came with black beans and white rice to fill out the entree.  \n  With the great atmosphere, service, and food, it was plain to see why this restaurant was voted one of the Top 5 restaurants in Indy.  I look forward to my next visit.\n\nReview #6",

Khyber Pass itself, has only been open since 1970, making it a baby in comparison. Still, the place is dark (even in the daytime), with plenty of atmosphere. \n\nKhyber Pass Pub also has much more than just bar food. First, they serve brunch all day. Many of those items did look tempting, but I resisted. Second, there are many New Orleans style dishes on the menu. Third, there is a chalkboard with a bunch of enticing specials every day. Do not miss these.\n\nWe started with three apps to share:  \nBacon Grease Popcorn:  I know, sounds kind of disgusting, but the popcorn did not taste greasy at all and was great!  You can also order Vegan Buttered Popcorn!\nNachos with BBQ Pulled Pork: With a green tomato salsa, this was a crispy and tasty dish. You can also get it with vegan pulled pork!\nGrilled Chicken Wings with Chipotle-Bourbon BBQ Sauce-this sweet sauce was very good!\n\nThe table ordered a hodgepodge of items for mains. One little blip was that 12 year old ordered a plain cheeseburger. It came out with tons of other stuff on it so we had to send it back. He ordered more of the wings instead. My sister, who did order the Khyber Burger with all the fixings (bacon, BBQ onions, creole mustard, cheddar cheese) loved it. Husband adored his BBQ Brisket Sandwich.  11 year old had the Gumbo and found it a bit underwhelming. He thought it could have been much spicier. I went on the lighter side and tried two specials:  Sweet Potato Bisque and the Beet Watermelon Salad.   The soup did not taste like it had much if any dairy in it. It just tasted like puréed sweet potato and it was very good.  I truly enjoyed the salad as well. It was light and refreshing....perfect for a summer afternoon. \n\nOverall the food at Knyber Pass was varied and creative, especially for a bar!  Service was friendly but pretty slow. Lunch took way longer than we wanted it to (especially since we wanted to get back to sightseeing!) So I would advise only dining at Khyber if you have some time to spare.",

This place has a juke box with 1950s & 1960s tunes playing, creating a real cool old fashioned nostalgic vibe. At $5.50 for a double scoop or a sundae, this is a little on the pricier side.  There is a huge selection with 40 flavors of ice cream. They offer free samples so you can be sure you are getting something you like. I got the chocolate fudge brownie and Making Whoopie and they were both awesome! Parking is available for $25 per day. Service was quick as it wasn't too busy.",

I had the Hellas Veggie Pita, this is always a safe bet for me since i don't eat meat. It was really good and huge for $7. I love feta but the clumps were bit too big and overpowered the taste of everything else. My friend had a seafood dish that had some orzo and three types of seafood on it. NOt sure what the name was, but it had some shrimp and a big piece of fish and something else. i tried a little of each and it was great!",

  "text": "I don't stay in hotels very often, but I must say my experience at The Windsor Suites was a positive one. I really loved the location of this hotel. It was walking distance to nearly everything Philly had to offer. We're pretty much in between the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Reading Terminal. So you can walk one direction towards the Museum  and go through Ben Franklin Parkway and through the Rodin Museum and near towards Eastern State Penitentiary or towards Reading Terminal which will lead you close to the Liberty Bell and other touristy sites.\n\nUpon arrival, we had the valet take our car. They offer a in and out service which was very convenient for us. It allowed us to take the car out at night and see some the sites and hit up Pat's Steaks. The checking in process here is a breeze. The concierge was really friendly and helpful. There were a few things I disliked about the hotel. One would have to be their elevators. They have 3 elevators but they were all so slow! My second was their bathroom. The toilet seat was loose and the sink counter and cabinet below was dirty. I had to wipe everything down with disinfectant wipes. Everything else was pretty spot on. The beds were a bit small but it was bearable. The rooftop pool was nothing luxurious but for what it is, it worked. It wasn't crowded, they had fresh towels on hand and plenty of seating. Beverages weren't allowed at the pool site. The views were pretty nice.\n\nVerdict - I would definitely come back to Windsor Suites if I were to visit Philly again in the future. I would just suggest to the management and housekeeping to make sure the toilet seats are on tight so that they don't wobble or break loose every time you sit down. And I hope in the future, the dust and dirt that was all over the sink cabinet would be gone. The value and price you pay is definitely worth it since you're getting a suite. Kitchen is kinda small, water and coffee are complimentary but I wouldn't recommend using their coffee machine. It is filthy! We ran water through it, and the hot water it produced was utterly disgusting! The closets were plentiful spacious. Our view was okay, 10th floor view of other high rise buildings. I wish we had a view of the other side that overlooks Ben Franklin Parkway. Everything about Windsor Suites gets an A except for their cleanliness. If the room was completely spotless, huge A all the way.",

All sorts of neat shops, bars, businesses and restaurants line the sidewalk, and for years, I've walked right past Blue Moon Pizza. \n\nWell last week I was in the area and decided to change all of that, and I'm glad I did. Blue Moon a pizza shop that matches right up with the Cal Ave. neighborhood. The place is small, but feels spacious thanks to the large windows, and the tables are the right size for sharing a pie. \n\nNow lemme pause to tell you about those pizza pies! They come in a few sizes, but what caught my eye was the \"mini\" 8\" pie. All of their specialty pizzas are available in this size, and at a price of about $6-$7, that's a screaming deal. We tried the Yales Thai Pizza with hoisin sauce, cheese, chicken, green onions, shredded carrots, and choice of sesame seeds or peanuts) and the Iron Man with Italian sausage, spicy pepperoni, roasted peppers, sautéed mushrooms, drizzled with hot pepper oil. Man were they good! Just the right amount of toppings to give you some in each bite without compromising the crust! To go with the pizza we ordered a large Greek salad, which is easily big enough for 3 to share. Next time I'd ask for dressing on the side. \n\nThis menu is full of other fun combos like the Strider and Have A Heart, which I'm sure to order on the next visit, and for those with a budget in mind, the lunch slice special is a sweet one at $4 plus and .50 for a topping.  \n\nMy friend and I had the place to ourselves that day, which is something that I hope changes soon. Go check em out!",

I guess my taste has changed, because my last review mentioned how much I hated it. There are plenty of windows and there's a nice tropical feel about the place. As for the food, they have everything. I can't remember if they had a full menu the last time I reviewed, but they have everything from breakfast to dinner and I think that they serve breakfast all day.\n\nI got an iced café au lait and an order of the shrimp and grits. The café au lait was okay, but seemed to be more milk than coffee. The shrimp and grits were really good. It was a huge bowl of shrimp served with creamy cheese grits and sausage. I really enjoyed it and for $13 the serving was a nice size. The dish had a lot of flavor and I didn't have to add anything to it to make it \"pop\".\n\nOur waitress was super nice and attentive and checked on us regularly.

  "text": "You can find Carmine's Steakhouse in downtown St Louis at 20 S 4th St, St Louis, MO 63102, this is about a block away from the famous Gateway Arch and convenient to the Old Courthouse and Busch Stadium, as well as the junction of I64 and I44.\n\nCarmine's is an old-school steakhouse featuring aged cuts of beef and an ambiance that would work well in New York or Chicago. There's an expansive bar, plenty of seating and also a patio for those wanting to people watch during lunch. \n\nWe came to Carmine's from Scottrade watching the Blues loose to the Flyers - great action at an exceptional venue. Carmine's was recommended to us by the cab driver and a fine recommendation it was.\n\nOur server was prompt and handed us a couple of menus - the alcohol menu was fairly extensive with four pages covering the various wines, house drinks and beers - I selected a quite good Deschutes Brewery Obsidian Stout and my dining companion went for a glass of red.\n\nThe food menu featured some interesting appetizers, Salads, Chicken, Steaks/Chops and Seafood. What intrigued me was the local favorite fried ravioli and we decided to split the appetizer (note that I had been warned that this local treat was \"disgusting\" - not my words). After trying it, I'm sorry but I simply can't recommend it here (and I'm betting that it's very well done at Carmine's). For me, the issue with the fried ravioli is that it contains beef - I think that if it were chicken or something a bit less fatty it would be fine. As it is, when you cut into the ravioli you're greeted by a greasy meatball surrounded by a lightly breaded ravioli pasta. The marinara did little to cut the grease and after eating one I couldn't stomach a second. Oh well, I was warned!\n\nFor dinner I selected the 10 oz Filet Mignon, inquiring about getting it black-and-blue (cold, rare guts with a bit of char on the outside). For a side I chose the broccoli sans the cheese sauce. The steak, while it could have had a bit more char it was indeed perfectly cooked temperature-wise. The broccoli wasn't anything special (maybe the cheese would have improved the dish? I almost asked for it on the side). I was passed a plate of mushroom risotto which was much better - I was just trying to save some of the calories and have something green.\n\nOverall, I thought the steak was just about perfect, the sides mediocre and the appetizer yucky. However, based on the excellent beer and the steak, I still think this restaurant is worth visiting and giving a try, especially if you happen to be downtown. Also, the service was excellent - I don't remember the server's name but she was quick, answered our questions and was very patient with a couple of visitors.\n\n(also published to my food blog)",

The clerk at the desk, honored my discounted price, that was given to me on the first night.  That was super customer service!\nThis hotel had the best price, for stay, and parking ($15 per day), after the welcoming center discount.  The room have a safe in it.  Bathroom Extremly Clean, I will sit in the bath tub! and SOAK!\n\nThis particular hotel does not have a kitchen, so there's no complimentary breakfast, however there is a diner right across the drive way.  There's not a microwave or refrigerator in the rooms either.  However they are so many food places that are literally steps away, you wouldn't even miss it.  You're in the BIG EASY, where locations, and satisfactions come easy. Go out and enjoy, I promise you won't miss the fridge or microwave.  They have ice, anything that you need to keep cold, put it on ice, we had a cooler (very small, roller type) that we brought with us from home, that worked perfectly.\n\n24 hour restaurant are walking distance.  IHOP and Walgreens was walking distance.\nThe House keeping lady, who I absolutely love, very honest, very welcoming, she felt like family.  Shout Out to Mandy!  I so wish I knew her prior to visiting NOLA.  Mandy told me about Food and Spirits!  which is the absolute BEST, and she have her own catering company which I can not wait to try her dishes.  She definitely knew the IN's & OUT's and  DO'S &DONT's of NOLA.\n(this one place we dined at called Deanies, was a DONT check out my review on DEANIES)\nMandy knew deanie's was NOT my style, and she hit me with the HOTTEST food place in the town.  She's someone that I will NEVER forget. Her recommendations was the BEST.  (check out my review on Food and Spirits)\nthey accept cash and cards.  if you pay the holding fee in cash, you ill get it in return BEFORE you leave, in cash!.\nWe stayed at motel 6 (or motel8) not even in N.O. and they were $5 more a night, but it was free parking. However all the activities and locations we visit was in N.O. and you have to pay for parking.  \n\nI will stay at this location again!",

  "text": "Great food in an area that most tourists will visit during their time in New Orleans. We visited for lunch while exploring and found that dress is more casual at lunch. Don't shy away at lunch if you are dressed casually! \n\nThe dill bread to start was delicious and interesting since dill is fairly underused at restaurants. I started with the House Salad that was a bit of a flop, but helped me meet my vegetable requirements. There was plenty of greens with onions and manchego, but the delicious dressing wasn't mixed in properly. The salad tasted like it had been drenched in salt too. My husband started with the Crab Cake and that was delicious! It had nice pieces of crab and a definite creole flavor with the seasoning. \n\nI ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was delicious. The shrimp were good and the sauce and grits were tasty. The flavors of this dish were spot on. My husband ordered the Etouffee Pasta and that was probably the best food of our entire trip. The flavor of this dish was outstanding. Despite liking my meal I would definitely order this next time. \n\nOur waiter was friendly and professional. The restaurant was busy, but we were still taken good care of for our dining experience.",

  "text": "I am going out of my mind trying to remember the name of the dish that I had at Kanella. I searched the website (btw, don't let the site fool you, the food is brilliant) and I can't find it on there; but anyway, it was a guinea fowl dish on top of some really delicious rice/stew business that was just... wow. I dunno if everyone else who was with me was impressed with what they got, but I certainly know that mine looked beautiful in terms of presentation, and it tasted divine. I did try bites of some of the other dishes, and there was one dish that was something like a stew (possibly the rabbit?) that I absolutely did not like because the taste of cinnamon overpowered everything else that was going on in the dish. As far as appetizers go, we really enjoyed the different dips, which were all distinct in flavor, and most of our conversation until the arrival of our entrees was an argument about which one was the best.\n\nThe service was great, which really it better be because the place never seems busy. Although, I think our waiter was annoyed at me because I asked him for his opinion, and then completely ignored it and picked something else. While I don't regret my choice, I can see why that might come off as a d*ck move, and therefore don't hold it against the guy if he was actually annoyed by me. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience but I don't frequent this place that often, really only when I want to impress the girlfriend who loves Mediterranean food.",

We ended up buying several birthday cards and tearing off the backs to make them into a one-page postcard. We stood in a slow line and paid for the cards and stamps, but were then told they have no outgoing mail or nearby PO boxes.

  "text": "If you know me, you know I hate shopping.  However, you have to go to the store and buy things - to eat, to wear, to feed your animals, to live you have to buy things.  So, out of convenience and now more than ever since Sam's closed, I spend a little more time here.\n\nI recently got their CC so I can save 5% on every purchase.  Often I find some of their grocery items are cheaper than anywhere else.  They offer sales and coupons.  And $5 off or on a GC if you buy a certain amount of a certain type of item, not hard to do.  Savings here can be found and I can appreciate that...\n\nThe stock in this store is pretty good, the customer service is very good - 2 seconds before Hurricane Irma on my way out of town, the manager allowed me to break open a multi pack of different flavored cat foods because one of my cats who was going through a phase would ONLY eat one flavor and they only had it in this multi pack.  Because the other flavors in the pack were sold at that store individually as well, they could put those on the shelf to sell.  It was very nice of them to allow me to do that.\n\nThe store has been there quite a while, it's always clean.  The only thing that's changed is their $1 - $3 stuff isn't great anymore.  I used to be able to buy kids' prizes there (like 50 of them at a time) and now can't find anything for $1 nor anything worth the $3....  I guess that goodness is gone, but that's ok - the rest of the store is still a great store.",

Mostly male bartenders, strong drinks, regulars, low key, lots of games like shuffle board, darts, etc. They serve mediocre pub grub until 10 pm, which seems like an early shut down time for a 3am bar. Especially since so many of them have late kitchens. \n\nOne thing new that I found through fellow Yelper Erin G., is the downstairs party room.

Three of us split a small pie, and we were all full.  They put HUGE portions of meat on the pizza, and it's baked to perfection. I ask for the pie to be left in a little longer because I like the crust extra crispy.\n\nThis location is quite popular, because by dinner time, the entire restaurant was packed with people.

I am actually writing this review while in bed using their free in room wifi.\n\nMy friend is considered a high roller here so we stayed at one of the Tuscany suites.  How can you fit 2 king size beds in a room? Yes....the room is that big.  Yes........it is that nice.\n\nThis is probably the best Reno has to offer.  It is the closest thing comparable to Vegas quality.  Not saying it's Vegas but the amenities, restaurants, casino, spa, pool,and bars are all exquisite.\n\nThe only difference is...........the people.  The reason why this hotel is so reasonable is because the people here control the price.  The law of supply and demand is definitely evident.  The quality of players aren't going to be like the ones in Vegas.  They will generally be your target audience of 60 and over, but guess what?  They are helping you lower the cost of everything.  Food specials, spa specials, cafes, gambling, etc is all catered towards this audience. \n\nThe casino gives out free match plays, meal specials, happy hour meals, money upon arrival.  They pretty much are giving things away.  You will never find this kind of bargain anywhere.  Their pool and spa is top notch.  I personally wouldn't even know that we were in Reno.\n\nWill review the Rib cook off tomorrow!!!",

Marvelous concept!\n\nI had a fried oyster, grilled shrimp with aoli, stuffed mushroom, pork and veal meatball, trout-stuffed red pepper with onion and caper, pickle/olive/cheese skewer, pureed asparagus on bread with crabmeat, mussels, and bacon-wrapped dates with cabreles cheese.\n\nFor all of this, it was $7.\n\nThey were all fabulously tasteful, and really made a total meal for me. I would, however, omit the pickle/olive/cheese skewer, as they were as-is, not treated in any way. Just disappointing. And the pickle was a mini sweet gerghkin. Rather boring. I'd also give a pass to the pureed asparagus on bread with crabmeat, simply because the menu didn't say pureed (so that texture was an unwelcomed surprise) and the crabmeat was quite sparse.\n\nThere are beer specials and drink specials during happy hour, as well -- as one might expect!\n\nIt was a great outing with good friends, fabulous food and a great server who helped us through the whole mass of options!",

  "text": "In the town where I was born, lived a man who sailed to sea, and he told us of his life, in the land of submarines. Well in this case, we're not referring to the classic 1966 Beatles song, \"Yellow Submarine\". Nope, this is the name of a neat little hole-in-the-wall establishment in Sparks, NV that goes by the exact same name.\n\nThose of you that know me already know that I love to eat sandwiches. It provides fuel for my body to get me through the rest of the day. And as accessible most sandwich shops are (Subway, Togo's, Mr. Pickles), I love venturing out to new and exciting places that I've never stepped foot in. And when I was in the Reno-Sparks area for work on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, I arrived at \"Yellow Submarine\" around 1:30pm. This place is in a no-frills strip mall on Pyramid Blvd. close to a tattoo shop and grocery store. It almost looks as if you're stepping back into the early 1980's as this part of town hasn't progressed as much as trendier areas in the Reno vicinity.\n\nWhen I walked inside, I was impressed by the decor. There were pictures galore of funky past and present entertainers and some unknown figures. For the green thumb, I also witnessed a nice variety of plants. Some were simple but others were over the top. Additionally, I saw some old school vinyl records, some creepy looking dolls, and if you get lost, they also have a map of the world. And hence the name, \"Yellow Submarine\", the entire walls throughout the building were a canary-yellow color.\n\nAs my stomach was growling, I knew exactly what I wanted and opted for a simple \"Ham & Cheese\" sandwich on sourdough bread (for $5.25). This sandwich includes all the normal toppings (mayo, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar) and a unique topping, Parmesan cheese. As crazy as this sounds, I've never experimented in topping my sandwich was Parmesan cheese so we will just have to see how good this tastes.\n\nSince I asked for my sandwich to-go, I was handed my sandwich within just a few minutes. Everything was conveniently wrapped in thick brown paper as well as parchment paper to assure a tightly-packed sandwich. I grabbed a seat outside as the Nevada sun was glazing and was ready to indulge. The first bite of this deliciousness shows that Parmesan cheese was what made this taste unique. And not in a bad way at all. There were also nicely thin slices of smoked ham while the sourdough had a nice soft texture to it. \n\nOverall, \"Yellow Submarine\" offers a fairly decent sandwich while being generous for its size. And considering you get more food for less price than say, a Subway, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. The service was above average, the decor is eclectic, and their sandwiches got the job done. So for those of you who happen to be in the Reno-Sparks area for business or pleasure, check out the \"Yellow Submarine\"!",

My partner and I went to the Liberty Bell and then wanted a nice brunch - and wow am I glad we went here.\n\nExcellent wine selection first off - I loved the boutique choices on the menu. Our server was astounding - attentive to the correct degree, personable and happy to provide recommendations/pairings with our orders. We opted to order several small plates and share.\n\nFirst - Poached Black Mission Figs - so savory and delicious! And I'm not even a big blue cheese fan, but these were perfect. Then we had two of the Bruchettas - Truffled Mushroom with Fontina and Brie de Nangis with Allagash Cherries. Both were really tasty and paired well with the wines recommended by the server. The only potential downside here is that they were fairly simple in construction - we could easily recreate this at home. Then we had the Smoked Duck and Spinach Salad which was just delightful. Again, I'm not the biggest pistachio fan, but they really did add something special to this salad. Finally, we split the Warm Apple Bread Pudding which was a lovely taste of fall.\n\nUnlike some of the other trendy places we visited in Philly, we never felt rushed -- so many other spots the staff seemed like they were just trying to turn over your table. This place was exactly what we were looking for - a quiet spot where we could relax and take our time enjoying brunch. I'd highly recommend it and will make a point to visit again when I'm in the area.",

  "text": "A very interesting replacement to the late night special LaPeniche. Horn's is a restaurant who's chef is one of my friends but on this occasion he was off and as I viewed the menu there were very few options. Saturday and Sunday are brunch days but I got there too late for that as they stop at 3pm. I did not want to order anything too outstanding since the head chef was not there so I got just a regular roast beef poboy featuring their house made beef daube. The sandwich was served on vietnamese style french bread and was very tasty but at $9 for just the sandwich and no side I thought that was a bit steep as the sandwich was not that big to stand alone. A great side would have been house made chips and then you could charge $10 with no problem. I assume that there are daily chef specials because the menu is a bit short and a tad over priced. Overall it seems that Horn's is one of these tweeners, white collar food in a blue collar style, but so far to be honest I long for the days of LaPaniche. I will be back for breakfast since that seems to be the most popular dishes served here or maybe a chef special or two.",

  "text": "I wasn't that hungry today but we wanted to grab a bite on our way to the dealer, so we decided to meet here for a healthy and light late lunch.  I decided on a cup of the mushroom bisque  accompanied by a croissant, which was surprisingly filling and very savory.  The bisque was delicious: creamy and savory with a hint of fennel and perhaps truffle (I think?).  Anyhow, whatever the exact flavors were, they meshed well and made for a very good soup.  The croissant was buttery and flaky, although it wasn't amazing; The Little Chef in Princeton still holds the crown for best croissants.  They do bake them on the premises here every day and you can definitely taste the difference, though (not a fan of mass-produced supermarket croissants).  It also comes with a side of pecan butter, which was quite possibly the most delectable spread ever.  It was a nice change from the typical cinnamon butter and just so creamy with a perfect balance of pecan and the butter's inherent flavor.  It almost made me want to get another croissant just so I could finish it.  But then I would have been brought more butter and gluttony would have taken over.  So I desisted...with much restraint on my part.  Dad's BLT with pepper turkey bacon and aadditional semi-spicy fried egg was great and makes me want to add a fried egg to every BLT from now on; it's absolute ingenuity.  My friend's shrimp salad on croissant was creamy and fresh, but it's not my favorite because I'm not a huge fan of raw celery; your mileage may vary, though.  And of course, we split the truffle fries because you can't come here and not get an order.  It would be the equivalent of going to Five Guys and getting a plain \"veggie\" burger (if you're not vegetarian, that is).  Service was superb, as always, and our food was served quickly.",

You'll have to be prepared to wait several long minutes - but it is worth it.  Cheap and tasty - not at all dry.  I got my T-burger with Ketchup, tomato and lettuce.  3.75.\n\nWhat a deal.\nOh So Good.",

  "text": "I stopped in here after reading multiple reviews about how great it was. My dad was in the mood for chicken and I remembered this place, so I headed over.\n\nI was here on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. I'm talking line out the door, people inside waiting on their order packed. I took this as a good sign, so I hopped in line and got ready to order at the window. I got the 14 piece chicken combo which comes with fries and a salad. It was a little over $10 which was perfect because there's a $10 minimum on cards. After you order they give you a number and you sit and wait. On this day the wait was about 15 minutes, because of the crowd, but that wasn't a problem. When my number was called I got my food and I was on my way.\n\nThe chicken itself is tasty and really generous. There was an even mix of wings and legs and I enjoyed it. The fries weren't anything spectacular and the salad was just lettuce, so next time I might skip the combo and get the 14 piece for $8 deal. While Golden Wings isn't on the level of Popeyes, you can't beat the price and the food is enjoyable. I'll be back.",

It is not like other Korean or Korean inspired restaurants I've experienced in the Philadelphia, NYC  and  Baltimore area. In my experience, the side dishes (Banchan) accompany the bibimbap and other main courses and aren't usually a la carte.  There are usually several accompanying little delicious dishes plus kimchee with most entree choices. This is not like those restaurants and the prices and the a la carte sides were a surprise. I recommend going there to enjoy the drinks and wonderful  service the waitstaff provides. But in the Center City area, I recommend going to Washington Avenue, 10th Street, or Chinatown for a less expensive and more authentic Korean (U.S) dining experience. \n\nMy friend loved the burger option which was well seasoned, spicy and flavorful. He loves spicy food and was happy with his choice. Our waiter, the hostess, the bartender as well as the cooking staff were lovely, friendly and anticipated all of our needs.",

  "text": "When we first noticed that the building that is now the Village Pub was being constructed into a new business, my boyfriend and I were stoked. When we found out that it was going to be a pub + beer garden, we actually let out cheer! Our home happens to be less than a block away so the thought of crawling home from evenings filled with mischief and relaxation sounded swell. \n\nInstead, we avoid visiting this establishment due to crummy customer service, strange policies, and a lackluster menu.\n\nOuch.\n\nAnother reviewer mentioned that her 6 month old sleeping child was banned at 4pm due to a policy of not allowing anyone under 21 years old in the establishment? I can understand wanting to take precautions from underage drinking but do people under 21 not eat as well? You are really limiting your customer base if a family can't bring their supervised children for a meal. We attempted to sit on the patio with our 5 pound (well-behaved + silent) chihuahua for some drinks one afternoon. The waitress rudely told us that no animals are allowed on the outside patio area and that we needed to take him home. I can understand that every place has their own policies but again, Nashville is a very pet-friendly city (especially East Nashville) and to exclude people with well-behaved pets from enjoying cocktails on your patio will turn off another demographic of people from supporting your business. It should also be noted that she was rude in the delivery of her message and the service to follow wasn't up to par either.\n\nThe menu was another issue as it was limited to basically meats, cheeses, breads and pretzels. There weren't any healthy or vegetarian options available either. I have heard from others that the pretzels and cheeses are good. I personally think that there should be more meal appropriate options instead of just snacks available. It could mean that consumers would be more likely to stick around if they didn't have to plan to leave for dinner somewhere else.\n\nI can appreciate the fantastic job that was done in building out the Village Pub because it is quite comfy and cozy with a large wrap around porch.. The 24 ounce mugs of beer are also enjoyable because of the nice selection of microbrews and imports. \n\nHowever, the alienation of various groups of people who could be loyal customers and the lack of service make jumping in the car and heading to another locale more likely. Tis' a shame.",

  "text": "I liked this place so much last time that I raved about it to all of my friends and came here again with a group of them. What a shame that this weekend's experience was both disappointing and embarrassing. \n\nI had made a reservation, which turned out to be a good idea because they were pretty busy. In the reservation, we had asked for an outdoor table. The hostess had reserved us an indoor table. We told her that we were willing to wait for an outdoor table to give the server some time, if he had been seated recently. While the hostess was reluctantly figuring out whether to give us an outdoor table, an older lady (maybe a manager?) came over and took us to an outdoor table. \n\nOur server was reasonably good. He frequently checked in on us. However, our water glasses remained empty for long stretches of time. When we were ready to order, the older lady who seated us came to take our order instead of our server. \n\nWe ordered 3 items for starters: the Dan Dan noodles, Crispy Rice Style Pork, and the Bok Choy vegetable dish, to which the older lady said, \"THAT'S IT?!?!\" followed by, \"THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO ORDER???\"  all in a very rude tone and incredulous facial expression. I almost choked. \n\nAs someone with many years in the restaurant industry, I understand  why one would prefer dining guests to order more. However, I did emphasize that we wanted to order those items as starters. Most restaurants don't have a problem with this. Also, even if I ever thought that a guest ordered too little, (I might secretly curse them out in my head, but) I would NEVER say it to the guest. \n\nAlso, as many reviewers point out, the portions are fairly large. I'm not  a hugely large eater and I don't think it's wrong to order a comfortable amount of food when dining at a restaurant. (We were still very full by the time we left.) The way the older lady reacted when taking our order was tacky and unprofessional, but the real disappointment was that it took over an hour for our orders to arrive (last time, it took only 10 min). It seemed like she \"forgot\" to give the kitchen our order... maybe because she thought we didn't order enough. \n\nAfter 45 minutes, we asked our server about our food. He promptly went to the kitchen and came back saying the food was on its way. 15 minutes later, we asked him again. He checked with the kitchen and said that they had run out of bowls. At the same time, a table of 3 just got seated near us. About 10 minutes later, that table of 3 received an order of Dan Dan noodles (in a bowl!) despite the kitchen's alleged lack of bowls. We still did not receive any of our items... not even the boiled vegetable side dish, which takes about 5 minutes to make. \n\nA few minutes later, a manager came out with yet another bowl of Dan Dan noodles, but he offered it to a couple who said they didn't order it. The bowl was sent back to the kitchen, though I suspected that it had been ours. I thought about lunging for it, but it disappeared before I could even blink. Another few minutes later, I talked to a girl who was checking on tables and got her to finally bring out our dishes. She apologized that our food \"took so long to arrive\" ... meaning 1.5 hrs in this case. My friends were really hungry (that's how they kept track of the exact time). I felt so badly about telling them how good Han Dynasty was. \n\nThis experience really deserves 1 star, but I'm giving 2 stars after taking my last visit into account. I believe the bad reviews a bit more now. I'm not sure if I can still recommend this place at the risk of having others wait 1.5hrs for their food and get rude service from that older lady (the hostess/manager/person who took down our order). We didn't ask for a discount, but if this happens to you, make sure you get yours.",

  "text": "Hello the 1960's called and they want their bad acid trip back.  This interior of this place seems like a venue that belongs more in a Los Angeles or Austin and it doesn't evoke anything of New Orleans.  This aesthetic of this place is just gaudy and painful to the eyes with all the clashing designs.  \n\nI've stopped in here a few times over the years when going next door to MiLa and while the bartenders often seem to be very good at what they do I'm really more of a beer or wine drinker (MiLa's bar makes great drinks too).  Generally I could care less about cocktails and while they do make some notable cocktails here they also come at a notable price as it is ultimately a hotel bar.  Cocktail fans and those who enjoy such uber tacky \"hip\" and \"mod\" designs like this joint has will probably love this place.  It exudes so much hipness here that even hipsters aren't hip enough to drink here.  Granted they do make some very nice looking drinks here but I prefer the comfort of more old school and antique interiors and just a plain whiskey will do me fine if I'm drinking liquor.  The drinks here are probably four to even five stars for cocktails but the interior is a solid one star.  I've never been in this bar when any sort of decent crowd has been present and it seems to close very early by NOLA standards so it really lacks for any type of fun social aspect.  If you only want to go drink a fancy cocktail in a hotel type bar that is nearly deserted with a psychedelic interior design then you will love it here.",

  "text": "I am just getting into BBQ in a bigger way, so when I saw Christopher D's review of Oink Johnson's Southern BBQ along with the few others, I had a strong impulse to drive up county and find out for myself what this place had to offer. It was a gorgeous early September afternoon special made for a open window stereo blazing cruise in the rolling Bucks countryside. I was in a good mood.\n\nDriving up 611 north of Doylestown with the GPS alerting me that I was at my destination, I still did not recognize it at first.  There is a small cabin on wheels sitting in the middle of the rocky parking lot, with a fruit stand on one side, and a puppy barn on the other.  That trailered shack was Oink's.  The front porch of the structure has two large BBQ grills, a large menu nailed to the wall.  Took a few seconds to get oriented, especially when this big fella with a white apron and big white mustache came over and looked down at me and said:\n\n\"What'll it be, young feller?\"\n\n\"Well, sir. I can't decide 'tween the Pulled Pork and the Brisket. What do ya think?\"\n\n\"They're both lip smackin' good, my man.  Can't go wrong with either.\" \n\nOk. I was hooked by ol' Oink's charm even before I made a choice.  This guy and the whole set up was right out of a Michener novel.  I was game to play my role. \n\nTwo of his buddies sat to the side of the shack under an old beer company umbrella watching this transaction.  I looked over to greet them with a reference to the weather, and they chawed back that maybe I should get one of both the pork and brisket. Nice upsell, gents. \n\nI ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, BBQ Beans and Corn Bread.  Oink disappeared into the enclosed portion of the hut on wheels to make his magic.  He appeared a few minutes later with a large white paper wrapped package that seemed too big to be a Sammy.  I couldn't see what was in it, which was just slightly troubling, but this man had such an aura of confidence that I let it slide thinking I was probably missing the point of just knowing it would be great without a need for a visual. \n\nThis place is strictly take out, so although I would have preferred to enjoy my BBQ on site, I had to take with and drive back home to eat it.  No biggie.\n\nUpon unwrapping the creation I found it was indeed a huge quantity of meat, but the roll had been saturated with pork and BBQ juices, and was too wet to eat. I ate the pork with a fork.  It was tender and juicy, yet the BBQ flavor was not very strong, and it was a bit salty for my palate. The Beans were richly dark brown, heavy with molasses and chunks of fat back bacon. Excellent. The Corn Bread in the form of a muffin was good, but not overly sweet nor moist. \n\nIf I could give a grade just for personality and appearance, Oink Johnson would be a 5 Star experience. But, as the Pulled Pork was not as good as others I have eaten, and the roll was a total loss, the food comes in at 2 Stars for me.\n\nI will get back there eventually to try the ribs and brisket, but I am disappointed by the lack of \"Zing\" in the Pulled Pork.\n\nStill, I recommend stopping in as the characters are wonderful, the locale very pretty farmland, and the food worth a sampling.",

I was happy with my Seafood Diablo udon, which came with plenty of shrimp, scallops and squid.  The squid was surprisingly very tender, which is very hard to achieve; most places overcook it.  The yakisoba was decent as well and the chicken teriyaki was very juicy and tender.  The portions are also pretty generous and definitely get the fried rice instead of the steamed.  \n\nWe came in a party of 2 and had our own table, which was really nice, as a lot of places will make you share with other diners.

  "text": "Went to Penang last night for an impromptu dinner with friends. I've been there once before, but let me just tell you, last night's meal was on point.\n\nWe started with the Roti Canai and Chicken Satay. Both great. Then I had the beef chow fun as my entree. Hit the spot.\n\nThe food arrived quickly and if you asked me who our server was, I'd never be able to tell you. I think about 5 different people serviced the table. Fine by me.\n\nIf only one complaint, I'd appreciate a larger beer selection. They have the standard domestic fare (Bud, Yuengling, etc) but are lacking on the imports (Heineken doesn't really count). I settled for the Tsing Tao.\n\nAccording to wikipedia, \"Penang [the island, not the restaurant] was recognized as having the Best Street Food in Asia by TIME magazine in 2004.\" Philly's own Penang brings the streets to the kitchen. Which sounds gross, but isn't.",

Service was worthy of fat tips, decor was upscale (as far as buffets go) & food was great.\n\nLots of variety. $21 per person for Saturday seafood/steak dinner:\n- shrimp fajitas\n- fried shrimp\n- BBQ pork ribs\n- polenta with marinara sauce \n- crab in black bean sauce\n- regular crab legs\n- beef brisket\n- Korean BBQ short ribs\n- chow mein\n\nWhen it comes to buffets, I can eat them out of house & home in desserts alone. I don't always make a huge dent with the savory items, but I do a lot of damage (to the buffet, as well as to my thighs) in the dessert line. El Dorado has a bunch of stuff I like:\n- displays of candies in huge jars\n- gelato (yay for the vanilla brownie peanut butter one)\n- jelly beans\n- canollis (not too flavorful) \n- tiny white & dark chocolate cups filled with fresh whipped cream (little morsels of flavor)\n- triple chocolate cheesecake (hella rich chocolate ganache)\n\nGreat place to stuff your face while still feeling slightly elegant & slightly frou-frou.",

  "text": "Since I prefer cocktails to wine, this place was never high on my list of places to visit, but a friend was having a party here, so I was in. Very pleasantly surprised that they offered three different flavors of Rekorderlig Cider - I tried both the pear and the passionfruit and loved them both.\n\nService was excellent; we had multiple servers taking care of our table, and they did a great job of keeping all of our separate checks straight. They were also very on the ball with greeting newcomers, grabbing more chairs, and keeping the drinks coming. Because we were a large group, they added on 20% gratuity to each check.\n\nI ordered two items of food from their $6 Happy Hour food menu.  Both were okay, but I wouldn't order either again. The hamachi tartare with sriracha and soy had a nice bite to it, but I never would have known it was yellowtail because it just didn't have much flavor. I did like the crispy crackers they served with it. The seared tuna with watermelon was a small portion, and it too was essentially flavorless.\n\nThe one food item I definitely would try next time is the Farmer's Platter - your pick of cheeses and cured meats served with a warm baguette. You just pick the number of items you want to try. My friends ordered this, and the portion was generous, delicious, and beautifully displayed.\n\nGreat spot for wine drinkers, with their own parking lot, cool interior, attentive servers, and many interesting options for food.",

  "text": "(Dined 02/25/15 W @ 1:00pm): Settle in, kick off your flip-flops, dip your toes into the soft sand, and enjoy the scenery because you won't want to leave!\n\nThank goodness one of my friends along on this overnight trip to the Chumash Casino recommended Padaro Beach Grill as our first stop on our way up California's Gold Coast. The vibe alone sold me, but how was the grub!?:\n\nChocolate Caramel Handmade Shakes ($4.75) - Nearly a \"$5 shake\", this truly hit the spot in Southern California's warm winter weather. Not as thick as Jack-In-The-Box so my lungs were intact, this was a wonderful mixture of really good chocolate ice cream dolloped with a cloud of whipped cream all poured-over by sticky sweet caramel. Honestly, this would've sufficed as a meal, but I was eager to explore the food menu. The only \"negative\" was that you didn't receive a little extra shake in a mixing cannister like some places. But this was damn good! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=RX6qdpO3DOH4Z1USJMkTRg\n\n[ONION RINGS/STRAWS/STRINGS ALERT - 4.0 of 5 STARS]\nThe Trio ($5.95) - A bountiful basket filled with French fries, onion rings, and sweet potato fries with a collection of BBQ, catsup, and ranch dipping sauces, this also could've been a meal in itself for one. The French fries were crispy, slightly seasoned and skiny; I liked them. The sweet potato fries were more crunchy on the outside but moist and sweet on the inside; I LOVED sweet potato fries and these didn't disappoint (no sauce needed). You only received a few lovely dark golden brown and extra crunchy medium-sized onion rings which had plenty of extra \"nubs\" to chew on. The onion stayed intact when you bit into it and didn't pull out from its batter casing. I loved these but only wished you got more in this sampler. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=elJv_ZWjaTt237mrmdIq6g\n\nBaja Shrimp Po' Boy ($9.50) - A two-hander for sure, this was filled with large pieces of crispy Cajun shrimp throughout, house made coleslaw, lettuce, Thousand Island dressing and chipotle mayo served on a toasted French roll. Oh boy, this was no shrimpy sandwich with its burst of flavors and finger-licking goodness! Multiple napkins needed. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=biMo9-Sdib2u9k--JXyw3A\n\nService - An \"order-at-the-counter-and-take-your-number\" kind of place http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=rqWaapJwF687nwmawzgJUw, we placed our orders, received our order numbers and drink cups, paid, found a table outside, and our numbers were called about ten minutes later. Once we were done, we threw our trash away (didn't appear to have any wait service but plenty of trash cans). All was easy-peasy with no hiccups. \n\nParking (Free) - They shared a small elongated strip of private parking with a number of other businesses along a stretch of beach, so parking could be rough. Otherwise, distant street parking might be avialable. \n\nAtmosphere, décor, ambience - A casual beach shack along the Amtrak railway line and the beach in Santa Barbara http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=PKMgHmcMa3qEg-L2FbK3Bw with Adirondack chairs on the porch http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=Lt1uyS_7nbvfdBabLupKzQ, inside dining was at a minimum with a couple tables for four. However, it was all about the outside patio picnic bench and table dining area as you gazed out to the ocean and watched the train as they went by. There was even a sandlot for the kiddies http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=pcoKQePJRQFshFbH04scrg. Minimal decorations and pictures hung from the walls all with a beach theme. A chalk-written colorful menu was placed directly above the order counter. Natural lighting was everywhere while some electric track lighting was used (but why!?). There were a couple TVs while music played in the background http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=8jVT2inwc8GIQ6sH2UG9Vw&select=J8cjAfcPJNN4OiBS3cyU2A.\n\nAttire - Totally casual, so I would normally be in a t-shirt, boardshorts, and flip-flops.\n\nOverall, I completely enjoyed Padaro Beach Grill with its amazing food, wonderful prices, and outstanding view (location...location...location). Maybe the beach bum in me was swept away by the scenery (it kind of was!), but this place truly had the whole package. The menu was simple, healthy, and offered that casual SoCal vibe. Although I didn't order any alcohol, their beer and wine selection may've been limited but the prices were standard to below-standard. Yeah, I'd definitely return next time I was in the area. I found total value based on the prices, service, and experience noted above (total bill was around $22.00 before tip). And, they accepted my credit card of choice...AMEX! 5.0 STARS",

In my book, this Remedy location, has gone up at least 3 stars since my last visit.\n\nI first stopped into Remedy a few years back and just hated it! It was old, run down and smelt terrible and the customer service was not good. And I know some people liked that \"starving student\" hang-out vibe... I did not. It was gross. I never came back. (I actually thought I had written a 2 star review - guess not). Then I was asked to meet there for a meeting, so begrudgingly I went. To my surprise the place has completely been re-done. \n\nRemedy is now airy, clean and fresh. The gross moldy-pachouli hybrid smell has been replaced with the heavenly smell of delicious foods. And the customer service - well, lets just say I was quite impresses! The young man working the counter went out of his was to be helpful. Even making taster size versions of a chai for us to try out. Remedy Garneau, I will be back. (But not the downtown location, that one's crap wifi irks me to no end!)",

  "text": "It's been a long time since I've left a restaurant feeling such euphoria and enthusiasm. In Riva has been on my list for a while to try. Usually there's a certain level of hype that goes along with anything I've put on a \"to-try\" list. A lot of times lately, I've left a little disappointed. Not today!  And not to sound trite, it seriously was love at first bite. \n\nA casual lunch meeting brought me to In Riva today. My group of three sat outside on the deck overlooking Kelly Drive. It was sunny but there was a nice breeze in the air. The view of drive was simply picturesque. If this wasn't a work meeting I would have been all over the photos! \n\nWe started with the Burrata & Kale salad for the table. Aside from burrata and kale, as the same suggests, it also had pecorino and hazelnut. It was large and beautifully plated. It was fresh, crisp and oh so enjoyable. It was the perfect size for sharing as an appetizer as well. \n\nI went with the Bianco Verde pie which just automatically made its way to the TOP of my gourmet pizza list. It consisted of goat cheese, pesto and garlic almond. The crust was light and flaky. Not too doughy but not too crisp. I don't throw around the word perfect too much when describing an actual item of food, but it was perfect. The ingredients were balanced proportionally and the execution went off without a hitch. Between the salad and knowing I have dinner plans for the evening, I called it after 3 slices and had the other 3 boxed to go home. Otherwise, I probably would have stuffed myself silly and made a scene going for every last crumb. \n\n**Next day cold, leftovers update. The pizza is still amazing but in a different way (that only cold pizza could be). After having the flavors chill out together overnight, the spices really have popped. I can really taste the rosemary that wasn't as noticeable yesterday. Yea, I'm in love. I'll need to go back soon. \n\nThe service was great too. For a casual spot during a business lunch, our server gave us an appropriate amount of attention. She was there when we needed her, checked on us at the right times and kept the dining process moving along. \n\nI couldn't even make it off the block before taking a picture of my leftovers. Moments after the photo, I was on the phone with my mom telling her about it. I went back to the office and showed several coworker my leftovers. I haven't even digested properly before writing this review! \n\nI'm in love. I want to shout it from the rooftops what an amazing experience I had! This was one of the best gourmet pies I've ever had and the atmosphere was chill to boot. I cannot wait to return!",

An uber ride is about $8-9 and no driver can miss it because it's clearly visible from the freeway. \n\nSecondly, the staff is exceptional. I find it almost hilarious (but very lovely) of them that they respond to any sign of inconvenience (waiting for a hotel key, complaining about your room smelling like cigarette smoke, the thermostat not working) by showering you with drink coupons until you stop. They do a great job with getting someone to respond in a timely manner, but even when the night shift doesn't know what to do, the solution always seems to be, \"let me send you some drink coupons!\" and it's all better again. \n\nWe stayed for 2 nights and our room had a very nice view of the Greater New Orleans Bridge and the Mississippi River. Two nights on NYE and New Year's Day cost less than one night on an off-day in the French Quarter. \n\nIt's also very close to the Oakwood Mall and gas station, just incase if you need some Cafe Du Monde before you hit the road.",

  "text": "Epic Fail, yes I said it. I've been very eager to come here for some time. The waits have been about 50 minutes to an hour. Seriously, come on people. Is it that amazing? I think not.\n\nI finally found a reservation on Open Seat, and said okay I'll give it a shot now. We were sat in the very corner seat for two. I wasn't happy with that, but another wait would have been a half hour, so no thank you. I'll stick with the seat I have, and it was probably better than the other seats.\n\nThis location is small. You either sit community style in the middle or 2 or 4 seat tables close to the bathroom and kitchen, or tables by the front by the windows which are better, or outside which would be the best once it's nice outside!  \n\nIf you want to come here so you can feel like sardines in a tin can or pigs in a blanket, this will be your place. Don't come here for a date night. It's not intimate and comfortable whatsoever.\n\nOn to the drinks and food, what made me most happy was my frozen creamsicle served with whip cream. It was yummy, but could it have been filled at least 3/4 of the glass instead of a half for $9 for this glass.\n\nWe ordered the potato gnocchi for an appetizer. This was more cream than anything and the pork belly type pieces were very tough. \n\nWe ordered off the specials menu for our main course. The Brick Steak and the Grouper Chimichurri was what we picked.  \n\nThe Brick Steak was very good and the flavor was sweet and savory. The potatoes were not very crunchy which would have been really good if they were.\n\nMy Grouper chimichurri was terrible. Why did they call it chimichurri? It was not that at all. Honestly this entree was like a Kentucky Fried Chicken Bowl with mashed potatoes on the bottom mixed with corn and beans(succotash) all of it was mixed together so the mashed potatoes were lumpy and not appealing. The Grouper, I tried to find the flavor in each bite, but could not find it, and also why oh why should watermelon be mixed with mashed potatoes. Don't touch this entree with a ten foot pole. It's $24 which is three times the price probably of a KFC bowl. Not happy. I tried to think the flavor would get better and I would grow into this, but it did not. It was not appealing and not what I thought it would be. Extremely disappointing.\n\nThe food here is overpriced and the fact that you are packed in as sardines and having sub par not flavorful food, it's definitely not worth it.  I'll pay the price for flavorful and extraordinary. This was not.",

The people that run the place all seem very nice and they want to run a quality place and seem to constantly work on improving it.  I'm really happy that this is a non-smoking venue so I can actually breath oxygen instead of poison and even smell something other than smoke.  The main problem here is that parking is a bit tight in the area and Mid-City tow trucks are always on the prowl these days.  They have a very long bar but when it gets crowded they seem to need more bartenders to cover the area so it sometimes can take a bit longer than I like to get a drink but usually they do a good job.  They have a really cool small courtyard area that is \"hidden\" away that you might miss if you don't know to look for it.  They often get bands and music that you won't see elsewhere in the area.  This place is always a great place to check out as they always seem to have something interesting going on.",

Sadly, I haven't had fried chicken at too many legit places but better late than never! (Don't let the simple look of the chicken in my picture fool you... It will blow your mind!)\n\n- Shrimp grillades/shrimp n grits (3/5 stars): Hmm... the shrimp were very tiny and not satisfying. The entire bowl was lacking flavor. Later I was yelping Luke's and saw how big their shrimps are... (unfortunately didn't get the chance to go to Luke's)\n\n- White meat fried chicken (2/5 stars); Awww. I guess white meat is healthier but boy was it dry. No good :(\n\n- Fried catfish (4/5 stars): Only had a bite of this - snatched a bite from friend's order. Tasted very delicious and fresh!\n\nService was so friendly. Seems like a local's spot, and all the waiters/waitresses were genuinely sweet. So rare these days to find this type of relaxed, happy service that's not just overbearing and looking for extra tips... so it's always a nice surprise finding it!\n\nOverall, it's a decent spot for food in New Orleans. But it was only 2 blocks walking distance from our Air BnB spot so the convenience was helpful. (We were recommended to Li'l Dizzy's by our uber driver one night)",

  "text": "This place is so popular and so loved I had high expectations. But I have to say that menu just wasn't doing it for me. There weren't that many options that seemed excited to me personally. Probably because they do a lot of turning a sweet dish into a savory one and that is opposite of what I'm interested in doing. \n\nI visited around noon on a Thursday and got the last spot in their small parking lot. I opted for sitting at the bar since I was there on my own. I looked over the menu and quickly decided to stick with a basic burger - always a go-to for me. I mentioned to the waitress that they could leave the bun off if they wanted. She informed me that, \"the chef won't make it without a bun\". Which was fine with me, I don't mind simply taking it apart myself. I just feel bad wasting food. \n\nI swear that only about three minutes passed before my burger was delivered! Talk about fast!! It is on the petite side, but is stacked two patties high and three pieces of bread sandwiching it together. This was a pretty solid burger - I found this particularly impressive considering the basic toppings!",

This was very disappointing to me because I live just a few houses away from the establishment. I had literally written this place off.\n\nBut then...\n\nOne of the owners, Jesse reached out to me on Yelp and offered up some legitimate and reasonable explanations on their dogs on the patio policy - it was actually illegal until recently to host animals in dining establishments. As a new business owner, I can respect why they chose to follow the rules instead of bypassing them. No shit? I had no idea and assumed that it was not a legal issue as many other businesses allowed it.\n\nAlso, in my initial visit... I was less than impressed at the menu options that lacked a vegetarian option....guess what? Yup. They have a delicious stuffed pretzel veggie burger now too. When I met with Jesse, he took the time to explain some updates to the pub and also was very interested and open-minded about my feedback. \n\nAs a consumer, this really hit home with me and am glad that Village Pub and I are back on track. It's really nice to have such a great collection of pints waiting for me just up the street.\nHello beer. It's Marcia. How have I missed you so?",

Make your own plate of food from various pre-made options like you're at Whole Foods (or Central Market, for my Texas friends - geez, I miss Central Market and HEB. Sorry, sidetracked)? Something for everyone. Healthy eaters? Options. Picky eaters? Options. \n\nI decided against their tasty sounding salads and sandwiches to try some of the pre-made options. I got some simply baked salmon, some kale salad, and some pesto grilled peaches. All of it was pretty good. They also have lots of options for snacks, drinks, desserts, etc. \n\nYou go order what you want, they give you a ticket (or tickets if you go to two different lines or if you're paying for more than one person), and then they ring you up at the registers closer to the entrance. \n\nThey also serve breakfast (I'll be back), and have a bar where you can order beer, wine, or coffee. (I got a cappuccino to go - very good.) \n\nC&B is another new Nashville spot that is trying really hard to be cool. High, high ceilings, white paint everywhere, so bright and airy you feel like you're in an aviary. Chairs that are beautiful but WILL leave a gorgeous geometric pattern in your legs and butt. I don't mind this as long as 1) the food is actually good, and 2) the prices aren't quadruple what they should be because you're paying for the decor. C&B isn't cheap. But overall, I liked the experience and the food.\n\nParking is rough, but there's a garage for the building just to the right of the entrance to C&B, and they validate for 1 hour (possibly during certain hours only, so I'd check that). I stayed for longer than an hour, so I paid $3 when I left the garage. \n\nEating at C&B felt like eating in a cafeteria at a fancy museum in NYC. That's good, right?",

Located in Holland Plaza, it's very close to where Café Linnea is situated. They are tucked away along 120 Street but don't let that fool you. If you're a big sandwich fan, this is on par with the likes of Sandwich & Sons.\n\nThe inside is spacious and I really enjoy the relaxed, chill vibes here. The back has a cool area where you can scribble your name on it. There's even a cow's head (his name is Fernando) and the pinball machine is pretty slick.\n\nTrip #1\n- Canons ($10.00), roasted root vegetables ($6.00) and pirate spiced fries ($6.00) - the sausage was great - flavourful, well seasoned and tender. This is G's favourite and I can see why. The vegetables included rutubaga, parsnips, carrots and candied beets. Wasn't very impressed. Lacked flavour and not worth the $6.00 price tag. The pirate spiced fries were much better. Thinly cut, mildly spicy and fried nicely. A little more crispiness would have made these even better but that's nitpicking.\n- Mr. Pink sandwich ($12.00) - the mix of the mayo and malted honey mustard is spot on. The swiss was nicely melted and the smoked ham hit the spot. Only thing I wish was that it was a bigger portion.\n\nTrip #2\n- Blindman Brewery Kettle sour #7 ($6.00) - I'm a Blindman enthusiast and their kettle sours is one of my favourite Alberta beers. The azacca and ella was delicious. Get it.\n- Old fashioned ($10.00) - oh man, all we could taste was the alcohol. Way too strong.\n- The hamburger ($5.50) - simple but satisfying.\n- Brunch pirate poutine ($13.50) - I'm just not a big poutine fan. This brunch version was decent but again, fries could be crispier.\n- Citrus dressed arugula salad ($9.00) - we ordered it to be somewhat healthy; even out all the poutine carbs. Salad was pretty routine.",

  "text": "We're in NOLA and we didn't get Southern Food? \n\nOn our last night in New Orleans, we found this place for dinner. It was the night of the Super Bowl so we found a restaurant with only two other guests in the dining area and just a handful at the bar. In other words, we had a restaurant to ourselves. Having a restaurant to yourself doesn't guarantee great service, but we got it anyway. Good start so far. Zea Rotisserie and Grill is great option for those looking to take a break from Po' Boys, Jambalaya's, and fried food.  What you'll find is a restaurant chain that serves seafood, sandwiches, Asian based BBQ, grilled food, and of course, rotisserie.  I can almost compare Zea to a Cheesecake Factory, but with a better food presentation and a dining experience that mimics fine dining.   \n\n-Garlic Hummus pita: This was our appetizer for the evening. I haven't had garlic based hummus before and pleased that I did. You still get the texture and taste of what you expect with hummus, but with an added buttery garlic taste to it. There's more hummus than there is pita and they are willing to hook up extra pita if needed.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ov8JM-bcpHBtL30bGfPkKw&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\n-1/2 Chicken & 1/2 BBQ Ribs Plate: This meal is big enough to serve 2, maybe even 3. The ribs are glazed with BBQ sauce and the meat is \"fall off the bone\" and \"melt in your mouth\".  As for their chicken, you get a seasoned and prepared rotisserie chicken.  Taste of their chicken rivals some of the top notch fine dining restaurants out there. Trust me.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QN7x6WC505-ZoDT4ptVHig&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ)\n\nOverall, I have to say that I'm a fan. If I'm ever back out here, I'm sure that my meals will be centered around the foods that I can't get in California or Las Vegas. But if I'm looking for something good, more traditional, and just want a change of pace from NOLA's Southern type dishes, Zea Rotisserie is on my list.\n\n\n\nYELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE - (034/366)",

I have finally found my go to Dim Sum for downtown Edmonton.\n\nCame yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  Brought a coworker for a lunch date and was BLOWN away by the hospitality, quality, and value!\n\nAs mentioned by other Yelpers, their price points are on the lower end mostly in the $3.50-$4 range with a few items higher ( ex. fried shrimp dumplings and sticky rice were in the $5-$6 range).  \n\nAnd the kicker, the curried calamari was the B-E-S-T I have ever had at Dim Sum!  It was tender, delicious, and full of flavour; I would have liked a spoon served with it so I could get to all the sauce for my sticky rice without looking like a cave woman but I dove in anyway!\n\nThe egg tarts had just come out of the oven and were divine, also among the best I've had at Dim Sum.\n\nThe sticky rice comes in slightly smaller banana leaf wrapped parcels than I'm used to but an order comes with 3 rather than 2.  I don't thirecall any baby shrimp in them which would definitely make my husband happy if I can get him out here.\n\nMy dining partner wasn't as comfortable with chopsticks and we had to ask a couple times to get her a fork but otherwise the staff came back and checked on us frequently, filled our water, filled our tea, and asked if we liked the selections they had suggested. \n\nThe dining room itself is quite large and open - I imagine it can get kind of loud in there but it was perfect yesterday.  We popped in about 1130 and had food on our table before we could get our jackets off.\n\nWe ordered WAY more items than we could finish and our total was still only just shy of $34 before tip.  Next time, I've got to try the noodle wrapped beef balls!  If you have faves here, send me a recommendation please :-)\n\nDynasty Century Palace, you have made a fan out of me!\n\nP.S. Dim Sum/China Town newbies, this restaurant is located upstairs above the strip mall at the end of 97th street (south tip) before you hit the underpass to the courthouse/Brownlee Building area.  Free parking in back, just be sure to read the details of when/where/how long you can park there before getting ticketed",

I like the simplicity here from the name of the joint, to the small layout, to the menu, to the actual product. It's straight creamy delicious ice cream with wooter ice.\n\nI thought that the pineapple flavor with butter pecan ice cream was extra delicious. The peach wooter ice tasted a little weird so you might not be missing much if you don't get it. Solution: ask for a sample!\n\nDon't miss out on this joint whether you live here or just visiting!",

  "text": "Hai Street Kitchen has been open about six months now in University City and it is a great addition to the culinary scene.  Its concept of using all fresh ingredients selected by you for a prepared-in-front-of-you Nori roll is excellent.  Actually because of the size, everyone calls it a Sushirito (a cross between sushi and a burrito)! Whatever it is called, the result never fails to be delectable and it def feels healthy at the same time.  Hai Street can get busy at dinner time with lots of Penn students heading towards it but believe me it's worth the slight wait.  My favorite concoction so far is nori and brown rice with pickled jicama, red cabbage, carrot, grilled aubergine, and chili lime marinated pork splashed with spicy mayo and gochujang sauce.  It's a total taste bomb.  btw - everyone who works at the Hai Street in University City is totally friendly.  Check it out!",

The overall ambiance for this spot is great for a girls night out, celebrating a special occasion, or just grabbing a drink.\n\nI have been told in order to get a seat near the window you should make a reservation a month or more in advance.

I walked in after the lunch rush, so there was plenty of parking, and there was no line!\n\nI ordered one of the main dishes we'd had at our event, which was the Tin Drum Curry. It was the first time I'd had curry, and it set well with me. I did ask that it not be too spicy, and as I made that request, they brought me more rice so I could thin out the sauce.   When it was brought to my table, after very minimal wait, I was pleased. It wasn't terribly spicy at all. \n\nIt was incredibly good. There was just enough chicken, sauce and spinach to make me happy.  And a few minutes later, Kaitlyn brought out the bowl of extra rice, apologizing that it didn't come with the meal. I thanked her. \n\nThe staff was very proficient about keeping the place clean and neat. The tables were wiped down and dishes - if you were eating in - were never left on the tables long. \n\nMy only complaint? No Jasmine tea! It had been there for the event, and wasn't there when I went back. *sad*  Ah well, I will be back, I truly enjoyed my meal!",

First time eating at Pho King and it's like most Vietnamese places in Edmonton - small, family run, slightly grungy but cheap, good food.\n\nI had pho a few days earlier so I decided to order something different:\n- R4: Grilled lemongrass pork chop and spring rolls ($9.95) - the pork chop was tasty but a bit on the greasy side. Came with two spring rolls, rice and side of cold veggies.\n\nMy friend and her bro had:\n- King's special beef noodle soup ($9.95 for king size) - she liked it but said it was bit on the salty side.\n- V13: Pork spring rolls ($8.45) - you get 4 spring rolls I believe, vermicelli noodles and veggies with a separate container of peanuts.\n\nFood hit the spot as we were hungry. Didn't even have any leftovers. Service is fast. You pay up front as is the usual case. Menu is pretty interesting/weird/random - Western breakfast options and burgers...at a Vietnamese place. Someone try these and let me know how they are. Haha. Other than that, good food and cheap. 3.5 stars.",

Since it is the middle of Polar Vortex in NJ in January, I was not surprised that the outside looked barren, but once inside the room is warm, filled from wall to wall with wine cases and endless awarded medals. \n\nWe decided to have the 9 wine tasting for $10 and had a magnificent sommelier teach us about the wine. The gentleman talked to us about tones and carefully chose our tasting order. We were having such a good conversation with him and the two ladies next to us, that I'm pretty sure we were well over our 9 tastings! Which then of course meant more purchasing for me! My favorite wine overall was the sparkling wine - Spuma Rossa.\n\nAfter warming up with the wine we were even allowed a tour of the cellar where they keep the wine aging, which I thought was super cool. This is an excellent place to impress a date without being too fancy.\n\nI am bummed we did not know of the live music, brick oven and overall fun that takes place here at night before our tasting. It looks like this is a great place where local bands showcase their talent and you can enjoy a small indoor concert with friends. \n\nOverall this is definitely a place where we would return. Wines ranged from $12 - $25 a bottle, so a little more than other places in area, but for the great customer service, it is worth the drive.",

I have visited the parent restaurant several times but today was my first at this more casual chain.\n\nThe menu is similar to what I have experienced at PFC, and the prices are lower, so far me likey. How could I not try the lettuce wraps, I'm obsessed with them and order at almost anyplace that I encounter them. Here there are 2 versions, I opted for the Thai and it was good but not great, but kudos to them for providing enough lettuce to eat them with. Next time I'll the original version. \n\nA few entrees looked enticing but in keeping with a Thai-ish theme I selected Dynamite chicken. I liked this a lot, crunchy chicken pieces that were slightly spicy. The veggie pasty of the dish was sparse, mucho scallion but just some shredded carrots and red pepper. Sauce was almost non existent. Trish ordered her favorite here, chicken Pad Thai. I tasted and thought it was ok, not quite what the dish can be in a good Thai shop, but for the price and quickness, very acceptable.\n\nThey offer a good rewards program that probably helps bring back repeat customers. At our early lunch arrival we noticed that the place filled in quickly. This is a good choice for a fast and filling meal at a reasonable price. 4 why do I feel slightly guilty Yelps",

Second, there were a lot more fries than sausage.

My waitress had other ideas though.\n\nApparently the only other table in the place was a 4-top of elderly folks and they were tearing into the waitress when I sat.  The manager had to come over to fix whatever it was that she screwed up and I should have cut and run then, but no, I was hungry.\n\nAfter she took my order I had to wait an unusually long amount of time - she just disappeared.  The place was empty and to make it worse, there were a couple of other waitstaff there but they avoided looking in our direction.\n\nThe food finally showed and it was fine and all - but the waitress was still M.I.A.\n\nShe eventually showed up when I asked the bus for the check and her tip reflected her performance.\n\nThey get 2 stars for the food-",

They have a solid happy hour as well as a basic bar food menu if you're not looking for anything heavy.  Their beer menu is pretty intense and they have a lot to offer.  For food we decided to go with mini fish and chips.  The fish was good and HOT and the fries were addicting.  We also split an order of nachos and salsa.  The chips were meh but the salsa was nice and fresh.  Their menu also offers tons of varieties when it comes to vegetables.  They had fried brussel sprouts but we didn't try those.  Overall, a good place if you're in the area and you're hungry.  Service was friendly.",

The bar has developed a clever system of using number cards that you have to show when you run a tab as it can get very loud when music is playing so that makes it easier to get your order in.  I've always had great service and the crowd has always been interesting.  They have adequate bathroom faculties for men but I've seen some shorter lines form outside the women's before.  They are usually very good about stamping you and letting you go in and out as you please.  The have a \"set\" behind the stage that has several \"houses\" giving it the look of a New Orleans neighborhood so that gives it a unique NOLA spin.  As with many things in the area it can be challenging to find parking at times so plan accordingly.",

  "text": "Nestled behind a corner off of 97 Street, I am shocked that I've never been to Double Greeting Wonton House at least once previously in my lifetime. They are slightly off the beaten path so it's understandable if you've never spotted DG before. We decided to check them out for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed. Choose a table or booth and pick wisely from the extensive list of dishes.\n\nThe interior is old, grungy and looks like it hasn't been renovated for as long as the Land Before Time (those films were legit back in my childhood). That might deter some people but me, the ghetto'er, the betta. Prices are super cheap ($5.75-12.25) and they have everything: noodle soup, noodles, hot pot, rice dishes, etc. There are only 357 items to choose from. Easy peasy right? \"Today's Specials\" on the very front page of the menu made me chuckle.\n\nThe hours are legit. Open till midnight and 1:00am Friday and Saturday's! Lord, Edmonton needs more places like this. We were a group of 5 so I was put in charge of ordering - I decided to keep it pretty basic and technically, pretty non-Asian as we had a few people that couldn't eat pork/meat and whatnot.\n\n- Spring rolls ($5.95) - six pieces of deep fried vegetable spring rolls. They came out piping hot, fresh and not too greasy. Pretty standard fare but I will give them a thumbs up if that means anything to ya.\n- Shrimp fried rice (#161) ($9.75) - fried rice is another one of those typical dishes that people associate with Chinese food. Easy to make but difficult to master and get that elusive \"wok hay\". This one was tasty but could have used more shrimp in it.\n- Ginger beef (#201) ($10.75) - I don't think I've ever ordered ginger beef at a restaurant before but the group wanted it so I obliged. It's definitely not authentic but you already know that. The ginger beef was hot, tasty and satisfying. Crunchy, sweet goodness.\n- Seafood hot pot - hot pot is always a winner. This seafood hot pot came out in an oldddddddddd school pot but it was so freaking good. Lots of fish, squid and shrimp along with tofu, cabbage and some other veggies. We actually wanted to order one of their specialty hot pot but the wait was about 20-25 minutes and we were crunched for time. Oh well, this one more than hit the spot.\n- Chow fun with chicken and kai lan - chow fun is one of my favourite noodles. Kai lan (gai lan) is one of my favourite Chinese vegetable (Chinese broccoli if you haven't had it before). Combine the two should equal greatness right? Well, mostly. This one was decent but it was lacking - the sauce was pretty generic tasting and wasn't fully integrated with the noodles. Decent, but I've had much better elsewhere.\n\nDon't forget, CASH only! They have an ATM machine inside but that's going to cost you unnecessary dolla bills so plan ahead of time, ok sonny? Put this one on your list for late night Chinese eats - again, they're open till midnight/1 am! I will have to come back to try more of their authentic dishes, which one friend has told me about, such as their eggplant hotpot, wonton noodle soup, etc. Essentially, all of their old school Honger food. Next time!",

From the $2m art collection and pieces exclusively made for the hotel or the view at night from the Board Room patio will be a conversion starter for some time.  This is a hotel I can recommend with confidence and will do so often.  The entire event was phenomenal and brilliantly organized.  Platt 99s' atmosphere is inviting, relaxing and beautiful from the moment you enter. The view of the city from daytime to nighttime mesmerized us while having wonderful cocktails and never ending appetizers.\n  \nPlats outdid themselves with the food and drinks tonight. I even smiled when I received my small, glass bottle of Diet Coke...to cute. \n\nWe tried everything from the pork belly sandwiches, mini lox puffs, YUM, homemade donuts puffs with 3 varieties of fillings, and my favorites, the Beef Carpaccio. Unfortunately, I  didn't get an opportunity to sample the Adult Grilled Cheese that everyone was raving about but then again just another reason to return.  My husband munched on the edamam with pinot noir salt and popcorn delivered to each table throughout the evening.  Our servers were awesome; friendly and managed our crowd very well. \n\nWe're looking forward to bringing friends back for cocktails on the deck or have a weekend downtown at the Alexander.  Can't wait till the next trip to Platt 99.",

The service industry is such a huge part of New Orleans, I've got nothing but admiration for the patience and hard work of servers. I had such a bad server experience at Backspace- it was bizarre, and seemed purposely directed, so much so that an acquaintance of mine also seated at the bar stepped in to call it out. \n\nAfter working 50 hours in 3 days at my Conference, I was super stoked to get a burger and a beer here after reading all the great reviews. Bellied up to the bar, asked for a menu, and ordered an Amber. It came in a plastic cup, which was the first strike when obviously dining in.  Then when I got my food, the bartender talked loudly about his bowel movements in front of me while I was eating, and joked about doing so. And here's when bad service felt like it was being done purposefully, I'm not a naive diner. My friend seated nearby comes to Backspace whenever he's in town, and called the server out (that's how obviously gauche the service was). \n\nNew Orleans is great for its choices when going out, and I'm happy to Yelp about those great experiences, and spend my dollars elsewhere.",

  "text": "Five stars is not nearly enough to describe how I feel about this restaurant!!! It is wonderful on so many levels - from the service to the food to the decor. I recently was searching for a brunch spot near the beach that could accommodate my group of friends and had a good mimosa deal. Here it is! I made reservations for 8 people easily on Open Table. We stopped by on a sunny Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately in a private back room. \n\nI must start with the service because above all, it was the best I've EVER had at a restaurant (you read that right). Our waitress Caddea was so amazingly wonderful. She handled our group with ease, filling glasses before they were even empty, bringing accurate orders and simply acting like a good friend of ours. Service with a smile doesn't even begin to describe how she treated us. I had interacted with the owner, Ruthie on Facebook prior to arriving to make sure we could secure a deal and there would be room for us...and she showed up to greet me at the table!!! A fun and enthusiastic woman with a heart of gold! \n\nSo the food and drink: awesome selection and something for anyone! Menu items are priced very reasonably and they have so many options to suit your dietary needs. Gluten free, healthy, vegan, etc. I went with the Egg White Scramble and it was a nice big portion! Fresh ingredients and it came to the table quickly. Other food at the table looked great and everyone enjoyed their meals! For drinks, we got to enjoy bottomless mimosas which were made perfectly and filled often!! $14.95 is a steal for this deal (please note, this is actually a deal only available on Sundays). \n\nI can't wait to go back to this restaurant not only for the food, but to support the wonderful people that work here. They made my day and everyone at our table agreed - this was the best brunch we have ever had together!! GO!",

A friend recommended I check them out when I'd become fed up with the rude and uncaring service at Planned Parenthood (I was without insurance for many, many years) and I began coming here for reproductive health and birth control.\n\nEveryone from the front desk reception to your clinician (you can request a man or woman if you have a preference) treats you with the utmost respect.  No matter what is wrong, you can talk to them about it and they won't judge or make you feel stupid.  Even the most embarrassing problems are treated with intelligence and professional interest. \n\nThe prescription-refill phone program is glitchy; there has been more than one occasion where I've called several times to no avail.  This can be frustrating, since birth control is a time-sensitive thing, but once you actually stop in and talk to the front desk they get things moving asap. \n\nIf you don't make much money and have no insurance, Mazzoni provides a sliding fee scale.  Bring your tax return or a pay stub to be fee-assessed.  Thank you, everyone at Mazzoni, for fighting the good fight in our for-profit, corporate, insurance-controlled medical system.

  "text": "What is this? A sushi restaurant on the Westbank that I haven't visited?? Impossible! I didn't even know this place was here until I went to Rotolo's a few months ago and a saw this little place next door. I made a mental note that I had to try this place for lunch.\n\nI stopped in and, although it was around lunch time, it was pretty empty. I took a seat and the waitress immediately came over to help me. The first thing I saw on the menu was the noodle salad, and since I love noodle salad, I decided to start with that. When the noodle salad came out it looked...familiar. I had definitely met this salad before. THIS IS A TENNOU NOODLE SALAD!! I tasted it and yep- Tennou. I looked over the menu and everything was the same as Tennou. I had stumbled into Tennou 2.0! I don't know if it's the same owner or a former chef who owns the place or what, but I'm not complaining- I love Tennou and I'm actually super excited to find another one.\n\nSince I was at Tennou 2, I decided to get my usuals because I know what I like: the Philly Roll and the Tiger Roll. The Tiger Roll is a favorite because it's tuna and salmon wrapped up in a roll with salmon and eel sauce on top. It's really good. I found both rolls here yummy and really fresh. The service was good and the waitress was attentive.\n\nI am rarely in Belle Chasse, but I wouldn't hesitate to stop in here if I find myself in the area and looking for sushi.",

This is a huge parade full of pirates and beads. Think Mardi Gras, but a little bit wilder (this is not super family-friendly like most Mardi Gras parades are.) \n\nI believe everybody should experience Gasparilla at least once in their lives. Yes, there are a lot of drunk people at this parade, including the pirates themselves. But it's really fun to see all the different krewes dressed up and having a good time while throwing beads. \n\nGasparilla really brings a lot of people to the Tampa Bay Area and is fun when you're into it. Kick back, take it easy and have a good time at Gasparilla. And make sure you get some beads!",

  "text": "3.5\nWe came for brunch recently. I had the chicken and waffles. The prices here are generally pretty reasonable so I was surprised that this dish was $16. However upon reading the menu I realized this is because it's an entire half chicken. I didn't want that much food so I asked if I could have a half order. I was able to get a quarter chicken white for $10, which was the perfect amount of meat for me. They did however only give me half a waffle which was a little less than I would have liked (and waffle batter is dirt cheap so I think it would be nice if they give you a whole waffle even with the half chicken order). I thought the chicken was only average, the waffle was probably better than average. My husband had a fried chicken sandwich and said it was decent but a bit bland. \n\nI'd say 3.5 stars for food, but am rounding up because the service was really friendly and prompt. We were seriously in and out in about 30 minutes, which was appreciated because we had our infant daughter with us and she started fussing near the end of the meal (fortunately the restaurant is pretty loud and no one seemed to notice or care). This is the kind of place we'd undoubtedly come back to if we lived close by, but I don't think it's worth a special trip.",

  "text": "It seems that true vintage shops are themselves becoming a thing of the past. Where there were once specific streets or neighborhoods that were known to be great for vintage shopping in any given city, that's no longer the case in cities like New Orleans or New York. I look at the 50+ dresses that are in my closet, mainly from the 20s through the early 60s. It's discouraging to note that even though I don't really even wear them anymore, they are slowly but surely disintegrating (especially my 1920s and 30s numbers). What was once a fine silk frock is now reduced to spiderweb thread-bare on the seams, shoulders and anywhere there's the slightest bit of friction. Evil moths have attacked cashmere sweaters (they sure do have good taste, as they leave alone the cheap cotton numbers) leaving them beyond repair.\n\nBut I don't mean to depress you. There's Blue Dream, restoring my faith in vintage. I looked through well-kept racks of dresses, men's shirts, jeans and accessories and was quite impressed. The prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent. I get the feeling they carefully choose each garment they sell, perhaps at estate sales where a dress might have lovingly been looked after, stored in cedar and out of the sunlight. \n\nBest of all, and I kind of don't want to reveal this lest you come and snatch them all up for yourselves, but they have quite the selection of old Nola postcards, most with original quaint writing on the back!!! I'm a bit of a collector. It gives me great joy to read what people wrote about their vacations. My favorite one is addressed to a \"Dear Ingrid\" in Chicago and the sender notes, \"It's lovely here, but give me good old Illinois any day!\" Clearly this person is both in love with their home and a bit touched for how could anyone prefer freezing cold Illinois to the lush, romantic cityscape of New Orleans?",

  "text": "First of all, it's called Club 21, not \"Twenty One Club\", and it's been a Mexican food restaurant in Tucson since I was a kid.  It's been over 20 years since I was last here. It used to be the best place in town to get great Mexican food, at least as far as I can remember through the thick gauze of childhood memories. I remember big, red-leather booths (still there but not used), a dimly-lit, yet cheerful & bustling dining room, ordering kiddy drinks from the barman, a friendly staff, and of course delicious Mexican food, especially the carne seca.  Nobody made a carne seca chimichanga like Club 21.\n\nOn a recent mini-family reunion this was my dad's choice for our first night out.  All I can say is the place has fallen on hard times. Granted, it was a few days after Christmas, but the place was dead. The interior was also looking very rundown, some of the clientele were looking a bit seedy, and the staff were cheerless (apart from our waitress, who attempted small banter).  It's always depressing when you see a once-popular place you love turn into a dive.\n\nAnd not the \"good\" kind of dive where the food is still great. The other kind, where the food seems to have suffered too. My carne seca chimichanga was so-so.  Service was also poor. Though the waitress was friendly enough, she flubbed a couple of orders, failed to refill waters, and forgot my second drink order. (At least we weren't charged for it.)\n\nI really wanted to visit Club 21 and find a place that had improved and blossomed over time, but what I found was a place that the Tucson restaurant scene has left for dead by the side of the road.",

  "text": "The Cajun Encounters Swamp Tour was well worth it!! Make sure you can spare about 5 hours in total for the tour. The swamp they took us to was Honey Island, about 45 minutes away from the French Quarter area. The shuttle stops at about 3-4 other hotels and the tour itself is a little less than 2 hours, but there is still other time to factor in, including tour check-in and then waiting around again for the drop-off shuttle. \n\nWe made a reservation for a Saturday morning pick-up, but the weather was not too favorable. They called about 45 minutes beforehand to cancel and/or push the tour for a later time, keeping in mind the anticipated weather for the rest of the day. Glad they did that because I've booked other tours that just pick up patrons and make people wait in hopes that the rain clears out. \n\nThere are things to know about swamp tours which they tell you while you're on the boat. I wish there was a little check list beforehand. Like, we wouldn't see and big alligators in April because they're all out mating. Only smaller gators too young to mate would be in the swamp (so they were a little harder to see). And in advance, be prepared or ask around about mosquito activity. \n\nThe boat fits in about 20 people. Try to be one of the first on the boat so that you're not hit by the water when the boat accelerates. And you're also closer to the tour guide when he feeds and attracts the gators. Our guide was Captain Mark. At times the boat ride was a little bumpy from bigger wooden logs just floating around. He did a great job navigating and telling the history of pre/post Katrina and plant biology. He's also well-trained to spot the gators, which I thought is difficult considering they were only about 3-4 feet long. \n\nAt the end of the tour, we saw 4 little gators, 2 water snakes, a few duck eggs, and over 8 wild hogs. Didn't see any exotic birds, turtles or bears. Overall, I was quite satisfied with this excursion and the service of the driver, staff and Capt. Mark!",

  "text": "This was our third Ethiopian dinner (prior stops were in Philadelphia, PA, and Evanston, IL), and we think the best so far.  The pastry appetizers and two dinners we had were flavorful, slightly spicy, and nicely done.  We liked the ground beef pastry a bit better than the lentil stuffed one, which was a little dried out.  The TA2 meat combination sampler (for one) was a great dish to try ($16.95) , with good-valued portions of lamb, chicken, beef, spinach, and a couple of lentils served on the traditional tangy and vinegary injera flatbread.  Son also tried the gored gored - raw beef cubes served with a spicy sauce and powder.  He liked it, and I was ok chomping on a sample of it, but I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the whole entree, just from the idea of it.  We also liked the bottomless servings of the injera bread, as I'm not remembering having that at the other Ethiopian places.  Note the Dashen Ethiopian beer is $5 per bottle (it was a nice, light lager like beer) , as opposed to the Bedele beer advertised at $4.  We're finding west 38th street in Indy to be quite the mixing pot now for various ethnic and good-valued cuisines.  This place has been in business for 8 years now.",

  "text": "Amazing view & delicious pancakes. I had the 3-2-1 Banana Pancakes which in Santa Barbara for a visit. My friends had already gone here the day before and loved it so I went back with them. The Banana pancakes are delicious. Bananas tasted fresh, and I enjoyed this with a glass of orange juice. The order comes with 3 slices of pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, and an egg. Not a bad price for this delicious meal either. \n\nAlmost all of the seating is out on the deck/patio. It was a very nice day and we were able to sit out and enjoy our breakfast while having a view of the water. We ordered at the counter and was given our order numbers. Our food came out quickly even though it was quite busy that morning. \n\nParking in the lot is not free, but it's not a bad price either. It's nothing ridiculous.",

  "text": "Ali Baba has been my savior once or twice post-Pat'Os/Boondocks liver assault/battery.  And that's all it's been good for!  Because it's nowhere as delicious as Lebanon's and the others, but when you're \"in need,\" everything tastes awesome.  \n\nI am fairly sure this is one of the first places I visited in the French Quarter, ever, immediately post-Katrina.  But I had abstained from consuming the goods because I had not yet learned to trust French Quarter eats.  \n\nAnyway, the owner/employees here are a bit odd.  The couple of times I resorted to Ali Baba, I distinctly recall feeling awkward, as if I should NOT be there.  \n\nAt any rate, I've only tried the falafels, as fried chickpea mush balls always seems like a clever intoxicated way of ingesting something fatty, yet protein-y (so I don't feel completely awful about myself).  They were always a bit too mealy and crumbly, and over crisp.  Not completely horrendous, but as someone who has consumed falafel all over the place, they were just average.  I'm pretty sure the last time I ingested the falafels, I refused the finish the last two and convinced my starving friend to consume instead (just wasn't feeling it after the first few!).\n\nNonetheless, Ali Baba is a most excellent vegan/vegetarian choice in the quarter, especially during those late nights.",

  "text": "I have yet to hire Blend personally, but have enjoyed their service and food so many times. \n\nOver the last year plus I have enjoyed a variety of events and food catered by Josh and Whitney. \n\nThe decadent flavors of fresh hot doughnut holes that are simply indescribably delicious, in flavors you can't imagine.  Not just sweet ones, but savory too. \n\nA Caribbean 6 course pop up dinner at Pignic. Flavors I had never really tried before. \n\nIn September they catered a Yelp MBC in my back yard. I wasn't in on the food choices or arrangements, I just provided the space. But they were great to work with. They showed up when they said they would. Finished prepping, set out the food and left my kitchen very clean. The Mexican style breakfast for 30 was one more creative and wonderful meal by Blend. \n\nDuring Reno Bites Week, a southern style feast. Complete with green fried tomatoes, BBQ, and the fluffiest buttermilk biscuits. True southern hospitality and food was so abundant that night. \n\nRecently they were part of an open house at the Tannenbaum event center. Blend is the company available to you if you require food at your event there. Josh and Whitney built a lovely cheese and meat table. Rich special cheeses- Brie, triple Creme, mimolette, Parmesan and other above average selections. The meat tray had choice prosciutto and salamis. The breads and crackers looked homemade. My son fell in love with their roasted red pepper spread. He wasn't wrong. As you wandered around the site, their staff brought out plates of other tasty treats to sample. \n\nLet's face- I might need to get remarried or find some other excuse soon to have Blend cater an event for me soon.  I have never been disappointed in anything they have served.",

Peruse the the shop before dinner, but a bottle and take it to the table with you. The wine selection at the shop (also known as The Rum Runner) is impressively varied and well priced. Their Wine shop/ restaurant concept was one of the first to hit Tucson and they certainly do it well. On the food front, they're Known for their Mussels, a definite must try. We enjoyed a bowl of those tonight. With a Caesar salad, fancy salad and the salmon dish. Everything was flavorful and well portioned, but a bit on the salty side. Wine by the glass is nicely priced. I love that their keep it real with their wine prices. So many restaurants in town mark up their wines to the point of of greed and that's a major turn off. Two servers usually handle the floor an handle it well attentively. The Dish is a solid go-to for locals and visitors alike.",

  "text": "Wow, I don't know why it took me so long to write about Tzin Wine & Tapas (major procrastination) but I went here a few months ago with a friend on a Saturday and had a great evening. The place is dark and small but has a very warm and inviting feel to it. The place was absolutely packed when we arrived. Interesting note - how the kitchen is literally in the front of the restaurant! Guess space is at a premium.\n\nAnyways, on to more important things - the food and wine. I'm no wine expert but my friend is and we both ordered pairings for our three shared dishes. The wines are very reasonably priced by the glass.\n\nWine\n- Vina arbodela ($6.50)\n- Sequana pinot noir ($6.75)\n- Noble tree zinfandle (5.75)\n- Lixa Alvarinho ($6.00)\n- Seguin manuel burg ($6.00)\n- Something else white which I don't remember\n\nFood\n- Cheese board ($18.50) - comes with three different types of cheese, bread, olives,and compotes. Can't remember the exact cheese now but they were all very distinct. Olives were so good.\n- Kale and quinoa ($16.00) - delicious! Wish I could make my own kale and quinoa creations taste this good.\n- Pork shoulder ($18.50) - super tender, melt in your mouth deliciousness.\n\nDefinitely an awesome place to take a date! Service was fantastic - both the sommelier and waitresses were top notch. I will definitely be back for more. GO now, what are you waiting for!?!",

  "text": "The Latest Metro Diner to arrive in the Central Indiana area, this Metro takes over the recently vacated spot that had been inhabited by local face Le Peep with a vibe that is fairly similar in ambience but a menu that goes full-on into the evening hours. \n\nI will admit I was a little hesitant to jump back into a Metro dining experience following my recent less than satisfying experience at their Butler location, but having been reached out to by their local owner, a delightful gent named Bern (on the local menu, the tenderloin sandwich is named after him!), I decided I owed them another shot. I declined their offer of a gift card or complimentary meal to compensate for my previous experience, preferring to enter this dining experience unannounced and without any biases on either side. \n\nThey've been open right about a week at this location. This means they're still fine-tuning everything and I definitely went in with reasonable expectations. \n\nI arrived this evening, a Friday evening before the July 4th weekend, and was immediately pleased to see, I believe, three accessible parking spots with accompanying curb cuts right in front of the restaurant. I entered through their wooden/glass front doors and actually was met at the door by the incredibly helpful hostess. As it was a rainy, yuck kind of night, Metro wasn't quite as busy as I expected but there was still a decent crowd. This location looks a tad smaller with a slightly more open concept and a combination of booths, tables and booth/table combos. I was seated at a roomy two-top on the inside of an aisle, though I was impressed with the roominess of the aisles (though I will note that when I left I had to go to the outside of the aisle as an elderly couple had come in and were seated in such a way that the wheelchair would not go by them).\n\nMy server, Bria, was on the money tonight. She was a delight. She was friendly, attentive and helpful. I found it adorable that she seemed thrown off by the fact that I was dining alone, not because of my disability but because of the \"alone\" piece. It was actually rather sweet. She got me my unsweetened iced tea and I took a few extra minutes to go for the fish & chips dinner that comes with fries and cole slaw. I'm still not completely sold on delivering the cole slaw with the meal, but I think we've established that's the way Metro handles it. \n\nI received my always desired refill and ended up with one to go. While it's always possible that Bern informed them I'd likely be by this weekend, and I had given him a heads up I'd likely visit sometime this weekend during my four days off, the quality service felt like it was just Bria. \n\nHere's the other things I saw - I saw teamwork. I saw folks helping each other when needed and I saw someone consciously managing the floor. While timing wasn't always flawless, they were on it and working it and learning each other's vibe and it was obvious. I saw one young male server working patiently with an elderly couple who couldn't decide. I saw one other young female server noticeably smiling as she served not just her customers but was in the view of others including an acknowledgement of me as I left. \n\nThese things are little, but they are HUGE. \n\nI saw the woman who'd been sort of managing the floor obviously notice that I was getting ready to leave. By the time I hit that door, she was there. Bam. Do I need the door opened for me? No, not really. But, it sure is a nice touch. \n\nWhile I'm not quite willing to hand over that fifth star, this was a visit that gave me what I needed - a good meal at a fair price (just over $13) and terrific service that allowed me to feel served while also having the space to quietly read. I didn't feel rushed. It was just an all around positive experience. I also like that servers were equipped with the ability to charge cards at the table. \n\nWhile I passed a Metro on the way to this Metro since I live in the Lawrence area, this is easily a location I'd visit again.",

Erin was quick but concise; the appointment lasted the hour it allotted but I didn't feel she was rushed at any point. She was very nice and we had pleasant conversation the entire appointment.

I was hoping to buy a Hulkster monokini here but no such luck. So if you're looking for Hulkamania board shorts, bikinis, tankinis or thongs, you're out of luck. There is one surfboard here, not for sale, but on display. \n\nThis is the place to go if you need a s*(& ton of bandanas though.

They offer a ton of flavors: with milk, blended with ice(snow), shakes, tea's, lemonade and any drink you choose can have extra's added boba, jelly, popping boba(today I tried popping boba which rather than a gummy tapioca pearl has a flavored liquid inside of various selected flavors) , etc. There is a charm to this place that makes me giddy. The drinks are prepared and then topped with a special sealing film with cute cartoons, which allows your drink to be encapsulated until you pierce the top with your boba jumbo straw. I love bursting the seal. I have tried the Taro (yam) shake based on a recommendation from YELP and it was purple yummy treat. Today I asked if there was any way they can make anything sugar free. Initially they said only the tea could be prepared sugar free, but in fact they tried and successfully make a Taro shake with splenda for me. SO it's not on the menu but can be ordered. It worked out great, since my husband can't have sugars without getting a headache. Today I had strawberry lemonade with strawberry popping boba added, it was great! Another plus is, if you check in on your YELP application and show them, they offer a free add in! Just another plus to give Bing's Boba Tea a try.",

I'm not sure why or how hard it is to remember two menu items. I used to serve, I know the deal. And if you can't remember two things, please just write it down. Example- if I say no olives, I mean no olives. \n\nThe bartenders are friendly and made an effort to remember my name which I appreciate, makes you feel welcomed. They have many tvs to watch a good game and any place that has Goose Island on tap I'm a fan of.",

  "text": "After hitting all the local haunts in the Soho area for food options, I finally decided to give this healthy \"fast food\" place a try. I only use the term \"fast food\" because the food orders come out in a quick and timely manner, I say it devoid of any indication that the food isn't tasty of high quality because I very much so believe it is and like the name says, FRESH. Housed in a strip of other eateries and stores, there is parking lining the retail complex which is in close proximity to the storefront. \n\nThe premise at So Fresh is that you choose a salad, a wrap, or a bowl from the menu. The menu descriptions serve as a base and then you add your protein, hormone and antibiotic free chicken and organic tofu are included in the price with hormone free beef and ahi tuna with a small up charge. Any bowl has the potential of zucchini \"noodles\" to be added on (I believe $1 for half or $2 for full bowl) or avocado for a nominal charge. \n\nMy particular favorite here is the superfood bowl which I have gotten with both seared Ahi tuna and organic tofu, both of which are delicious. I enjoy that the restaurant keeps bottles of Sriracha for patrons and I fee or really compliments the meal. There are fountain drinks available and they sell gluten free (I think) oatmeal cookies for a sweet treat. The staff is always friendly and helpful and able to answer any question you may have and works to give you a quality product efficiently. I have never waited for more than 5-10 minutes for my meal so I would advise coming here if you want good, wholesome healthy food and are in a rush, as long as it's convenient to you. There is also another location off Fowler which is their original location. I will be sure to return again and again. I really enjoy their flavorful options and inventive creations. \n\nThe interior, although not large is comfortable and has nice decor appropriate for the restaurant. I can attest that the restroom that they have was clean when I used it to wash my hands. Overall, a really great place and I look forward to my next meal from there.",

  "text": "I saw the Creole Creamery on the Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and knew I had to try it whenever I visited New Orleans. It did not disappoint. It is as good as any ice cream I have tasted. It features some unique flavors. There are a couple of samplers, 4 mini scoops for $4.50 or 6 mini scoops for $6, so that you can try a few flavors. Despite the name, the mini scoops are regular size scoops. I tried the cookie monster, café au lait, lavender honey, and black and gold crunch. The café au lait and black and gold crunch are my favorites. The black and gold crunch honors the colors of the New Orleans Saints. It is comprised of French vanilla & chicory root w/ Oreos & chocolate chips. It is as delicious as it looks and sounds. Moreover, I saw the \"Skyscraper\" featured on the Food Network. In a tall glass, it contains cookies & cream, chocolate and vanilla layered with caramel, hot fudge and crushed oreos served with whipped cream, sprinkles, a cherry, and a wafer. It is very good and $7.50. I tried it on my second visit to the Creamery. Nevertheless, I recommend getting one of the mini scoop samplers and trying multiple unique flavors instead.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.",

  "text": "Below average pricey Thai restaurant with a full vegan menu.  \n\nVisited on 12/2/17 at 5PM.  I must have passed by this place a hundred times and never noticed it which is ludicrous because the sign on the outside of the building is absolutely enormous and they have a unique round entryway around the front door. It sits in a small strip mall next to a consignment store and a laundromat.  \n\nInside it's rather un-inspiring with plain tables and clutter.  It is one of those sketchy looking places where you want to order \"something safe\" if ya know what I mean. We were seated very quickly and service was fast and friendly.  $41.57 got us a seafood entree, a chicken satay appetizer, and a kid's meal. \n\nI got the $7.95 chicken satay appetizer which came with four chicken skewers, a bowl of peanut sauce, and a bowl of cucumber salad.  The cucumber salad was fantastic...chock full of fresh jalapenos and onions and fresh cucumbers.  The peanut sauce was a little bland but a very generous portion.  The chicken skewers were yellow, hard, dry, flavorless, and barely room temperature.  I am certain that they were cooked either yesterday or earlier today and re-heated.  For the price, I'd expect some freshly cooked chicken.  \n\nMy son got the $9.95 kid's chicken pineapple fried rice which came with apple juice and a spring roll.  I do not like paying ten dollars for a kid's meal at any restaurant but I will say their portion was enormous.  They give 3-4 times more than any child can possibly eat.  It was the best thing I tried tonight...hot and fresh and well seasoned. I found it unusual that it was smothered with fried onions which I wouldn't think is very kid friendly.  My advice would be to cut the portion in half and lower that price and nix the onions.   Also the meal was supposed to come with a dessert which they never brought out. \n\nI watched in horror as my husband's dish arrived.  He had the $20.95 \"seafood basil delight\" which the menu said had shrimp, calamari, mussels, and scallops stir fried with basil and onions and an herbal sauce.  What arrived was a plate full of green peppers, onions, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The scallops were missing and the green peppers were not on the menu description.  This is not the sort of place where I would order something like this but my husband is a brave man.  He said he'd give it a \"4 out of 10\" and that it was hot but bland.  \n\nThe prices here do not match the quality of the food.  Serving old chicken is absolutely unforgivable.  I would not go back.",

  "text": "If I had to live on nothing but Southern eats for the rest of my life, I'd be perfectly content.\n\nJones intrigued me for quite some time -- the storefront seemingly standing out whenever I'd walk by it. Finally, last Sunday, a friend and I decided to stop in for a late brunch. We saw people waiting outside, but since we were a small party, we were quickly seated.\n\nI had a perfect view of the kitchen from my chair. It was a curse. Despite the fact that we had been seated just three minutes before and hadn't even ordered yet, I wanted my food that instant. I don't think I've ever been as impatient at a restaurant than I was at Jones. It's amazing my friend didn't hurt her neck considering how many times I urged her to turn around/strain to look at plates being produced behind her.\n\nWe decided to have a sober brunch, so I started with a Jones cream soda -- mostly because of the irony and the fact that I didn't think I had one since I was 13. Still good stuff.\n\nFor entrees, my friend got the meatless cheese sandwich and ate every bite. She loved it. I got the fried chicken and fries basket, and despite a truly valiant effort, it looked like I didn't take a bite by the time I was finished with it. I'm fairly certain they had an entire chicken squished into that basket, sans feet (thank you for that, Jones) and head (also thank you for that, Jones). It also came with cole slaw, which was exceptional for when you're comparing it to other slaws.\n\nNeedless to say, I'll be back. I could only fit so much chicken in my stomach on that day -- and there are so many other menu options still on my in-brain list to try!",

I foresee many a dollar of mine being spent here....\n\nIt gets VERY busy, and on Sunday when I stopped in with a friend it was no exception. Luckily, there were two seats at the bar, so we snagged them and sat down. After drooling over another customer's plate of mussels, I decided I had to get them. White wine with bacon, leeks, and a piece of \"dippy\" bread? Um score. My friend had the chicken chimichanga, and it was cheesy but still full of flavor and amazing! \n\nBut let's talk cocktails, something that really gets my engine running and Tavern hit the mark.\n\nThe red sangria was pre-mixed and topped off with some bubbly. It was a good sangria, but not over the top good. However, my balsamic martini with stoli, strawberry puree, and a splash of balsamic syrup?? Creative and delicious! I will be ordering the drink again and again! The bellini sparkle was not in a tiny champagne flute, it was in a tumbler and was refreshing. My friend couldn't stop ordering the cucumber, apple, and elderflower cocktail. Be warned, it is very strong! \n\nI was worried our service would be poor because they only had 2 bartenders for the entire bar, but it wasn't. They were attentive and sure to check up on us and get our orders in. They also have some incredible outdoor seating areas, and enjoying a cocktail on a nice day here is heaven. \n\nThanks for the good times Tavern, I can't wait to see you again!",

  "text": "We went to the Underground Tap & Grill for the first time on a Saturday evening. We were expecting the place to be packed (Oilers game) but when we got there around 7pm, it wasn't!  Place is nicer than I expected with a very cozy, chilled out bar vibe. I really liked the music - good song selection and best part is that they don't blast it. You can actually have a decent conversation without having to scream and yell. A nice change of pace from the rest of the bars in town.\n\nAnyways, beer wise, they have a great selection. You can pick from their regular menu (100-400 level which is categorized based on intensity/level of flavour). Then they have their rotational menu with quite a selection to choose from. A buddy and I got there early so we had a few beers and drinks before the rest of our friends came to join us. So I'm just writing about what we had:\n\n- Guldenberg ($8) - 12oz beer from their rotational menu. It is 8.5% and from Belgium. I'm no beer expert but it was a blond ale and was well balanced.\n- Wee Angry Scotch Ale (300 level) - dark ale that my buddy ordered. \n- Lowrider Double Rye Ale (rotational menu) - I believe this was the other beer he ordered. I can't remember the name for sure but it was a 12oz and it almost had a bit of a wine aroma to it.\n \n- Green onion cake sandwich ($13) - a friend that had gone before told me that this was pretty decent. Comes with pulled pork, suey choy, tomatoes and green onions with a green onion cake as the sandwich. They claim it is homemade but I wasn't too impressed with it. I've had better green onion cakes at Asian restaurants. And for the price, definitely would not order it again. For my side, I had the garden salad with lemon honey dressing. Nothing special again.\n- BBQ burger ($15) - 8oz beef infused with bbq sauce, cheddar and bacon. My buddy liked it but said he has had much better burgers. He upgraded to get the sweet potato fries.\n\nBasically, good if you want to try beers. Mediocre for food (as you would expect for bar food in Edmonton). Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. Just go for a few beers.",

Not sure what brand they're using but it certainly isn't coming out of the plant that shall remain nameless but is located just down the street from the Board of Education. If you've been there you won't mistake that product for what these guys are serving. The bun was wrong, too. No poppy seeds and not quite as tall as it should be to hold the ingredients in. \n\nI will probably make it back as I work pretty close by these days but I'll have to dig deeper into the menu to see if the beef or the pizza puff bring back the memories the way I was expecting. \n\nYes, the woman at the counter was rude and short with me. No, that isn't \"Chicago ambiance.\"",

The view of the river isn't as nice as other spots along the river as there is a fence blocking access.  This park is all shiny and new and certainly doesn't look like your typical New Orleans riverside venue.  The access bridge could be a challenge for some but it is also one of the best places to train running up and down a significant elevation in NOLA.  The biggest downside is this park closes relatively early and they lock everything down so no later night running which during the Summer months is the better way to go in our heat.",

I was in the mood for a skanky chai latte, but the skinny bitch latte just had that calorie conscious ring to it.\n\nAfter a bit of thought I decided, skanky it shall be!\n\nThis has got to be one of my favorite places in Tampa. I had never really put a pulse on \"hipster\" in Tampa, but I found the closest thing to it at Bricks. Plenty of space to lounge here with a nice offering that ranged from caffeinated beverages to brews and snacks.\n\nI would have never typically thought to throw bacon on a peanut butter and banana sandwich and then drizzle with honey, but I'm glad someone did.\nThe Elvis sandwich is a hunka, hunka, burning yum!\n\nI would give this place five stars all day, except for the fact that service is slow. Like, dial-up slow. Like larvae to butterfly metamorphosis slow. So slow in fact that on a pretty *slow* afternoon, it would take 20 minutes just to get an iced chai even though you have a clear view of queue and activity of the servers. So slow that from time of check request to actually receiving it, was about another 20 minutes.\n\nWhile the laid back atmosphere is one of the things that makes this place so cool, it's also the incredibly laid back service that could put a damper on things if you're in a rush.",

I hadn't been to Jones in way over a decade so I figured maybe things had changed.

  "text": "WCSP is one of the true \"hidden gems\" of NJ. Roughly 4000 scenic acres right along the Delaware River, in a very relaxed setting. In fact, if you want to visit a beautiful park and avoid crowds, this is one of your best choices. While the picnic tables near the river get crowded on summer weekends, the rest of the park (across Rt 29) is usually almost empty.\nThe D&R Canal cuts right through the park, so you can start here and bicycle up to Lambertville (7 miles each way), have lunch and come back and never cross a busy road. The tow path is hard packed cinder & gravel so I'd recommend using a mountain bike or hybrid. The gravel could be a little rough on road bike tires, so don't say I didn't warn you. You cna also bike south toward Trenton, although I'd recommend you stop before getting to the city, unless you are wearing body armor.\nJust north of the park is the tiny hamlet of Titusville, which is one of the most quaint towns in NJ. Biking or walking through here is a treat anytime of the year. You can do a really nice three-mile loop from the WCSP lower parking lot, up the towpath to Titusville, go left on Church St. Left again onto River Rd, and walk/bike down to the parking lot.\nAcross Rt 29, in the main section of the park, are tons of trails, a nature center, a small museum (yes, George did cross here). \nSo whether you like to hike, walk your dog, bike ride, picnic, or just relax on a bench watching the majestic Delaware River go by, this park has it all.",

  "text": "I don't know how long I've been saying that if the world was ending or if I was dying, the first thing I'd do is rush to Vetri. Thankfully, neither scenario happened, and I was privileged to finally dine there last night. \n\nWith that being said, I obviously preemptively put Vetri Cucina on a pedestal surrounded with unrealistic hype. I had butterflies the moments leading up to my visit of combined sheer giddiness and nerves, that I would somehow be let done. I'm ecstatic to report that my dining experience at Vetri was one of the top dining experiences of my lifetime, and I found it to be truly everything everyone says it is, and more. \n\nUpon entry to the restaurant, I was actually a little uncertain. The hallway was narrow, and I had to walk through a crowd to get to the hostess stand. That literally was the lowlight of the evening, and that's not even horrible. Every aspect of the evening was stellar from there-on-out. \n\nWhere to begin? Well, to start, I wish I was taking notes. Our server was so knowledgeable that I wish I could've written down everything he said about the food and the wine. The wine paring was extraordinary from the thorough to description to the actual pairing. I had the six-pour pairing and I'd absolutely recommend going that route. I didn't view the actual list until after the meal, I didn't realize that they literally listed the wines and dishes they paired with on the page. This is a great keepsake, and guide for my own future pairings. \n\nAfter our aperol spritz, we started with a few \"snacks\" and a vegetable crudités platter for the table. We passed the veggies and helped ourselves to the snacks from the center of the table. Our next course, after the bread, was our antipasti. I didn't realize the plate in front of me was my tuna crudo, and mine alone. Theoretically, a group could share and pass everything. We did, to some extent, however we mostly ate the plate in front of us. Based on specific wine pairings, this does make sense.  \n\nTaking a step back, before our tasting journey began, our server gave us some time to discuss the menu and our preferences. I was told to \"not be shy\" if there was something I really wanted to try. While the tasting menu had the element of surprise at every course, the meal was centered around that initial conversation with the server. From just looking at the menu, there were a few standouts that I simply needed to try. \n\nAfter the antipasti- we moved on to multiple rounds of pasta. Mamma mia! The swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter was one of the most exquisite things I've ever eaten in my entire life. The gnocchi melted in my mouth as the flavor of the brown butter sauce lingered. This was served with the tortellini with truffle sauce that would've been a knockout on its own. I received the mafaldini with lamb shank ragu as my second pasta course. This was my must-have, and while delicious, the gnocchi still takes the cake. Special shout out to the delectable seafood in the tonnarelli al Frutti di mare that I sampled for one of the other plates\n\nAt this point in the meal, I was starting to hurt, however there was no looking back. No food down, no food left behind. Of course, I had to sample the next round of bread that came out- the sourdough. No regrets either. \n\nI rallied in time for our secondi; in my case, the milk fed veal with asparagus- yet another standout from my initial menu review. I've said this before about veal, however, we have a new winner. This was the BEST veal I've had in my life. We had two different preparations of this tender, tender meat. One was more tender and filet-like, the other was delectably fattier with a slight crisp. There was a dollop of sauce, however I preferred the veal in its own juices. \n\nFinally, we reached dessert status. Based on our groups eagerness to try everything, our server ended up bringing us one of each dessert option. The pistachio flan was placed in front of me, and the pistachio that oozed out of the flan upon dipping my fork was a highlight. We literally based the plates around the table and it was great to try a little of everything. I hit crazy status when the little pastry tray was placed in the center. Did I need to try one of everything? Probably not, but when at Vetri, you try to eat it all. \n\nWhile the food was phenomenal, the staff added to the entire experience. Aside from our fantastic server, the team work and collaboration of guest service was apparent. We had so many people interacting with us throughout the meal that were aiming to please and perfectly harmonized with the actions of their colleagues. \n\nI was smiling on the outside and smiling on the inside. This meal is a true highlight in my culinary life.  So, I'm so thrilled the world isn't ending and I'm not dying. While I've checked a major item off my bucket list, it's only left me with the taste for more of the finer Vetri Cucina dining experience.",

  "text": "I recently visited La Collina for a work lunch and had a really nice experience. My group was greeted promptly and seated at a window seat overlooking Manayunk. La Collina is high enough up on the hill that the view is actually of Manayunk and thankfully not of Route 76 (at least where we were sitting). The dining room had a classic, old school Italian feel. The room had a warm and inviting ambiance. \n\nI was caught a little off guard when our lunch menu was different from the one posted on their website. A little disappointed that I couldn't try the Vitello con Melanzane, I quickly rebounded and went with the Vitello alla Sorrentina. Fate worked in my favor and I loved the dish! This francese style veal was topped with eggplant, mozzarella and a light auroa sauce was a delight! I'm not sure exactly what an auroa sauce is, but it was rich, creamy and I can tell you that I used the bread to soap up every last drop of sauce on my plate. The veal was tender and each topping blended together creating the feel of a complete dish, versus a bunch of ingredients on a plate. \n\nThe group only had entrees but I would love to come back and try some of the appetizers. Wine would be nice too. It's always hard to have a delicious Italian meal without a nice glass of red accompanying it. I totally can see this being a nice date night spot. \n\nThe service was good too; attentive but not over bearing. We were able to hear some chatter coming from the kitchen, but the restaurant was pretty empty while we were there so maybe if there was more buzz around us that wouldn't have happened. \n\nAll and all it was a good time and I'd return on my own for a non-work meal.",

So much sushi happiness...\n\nAnyway, i still go there once and a while but I had a bad experience with one of the waitresses named Ester back in October.  My mom was visiting in from out of town and I told her that we had to come here since it was my favorite sushi spot.  At the end of the night, Ester was yelling at my mom and I was just horrified that this could happen at a business.  I was just so embarrassed and angry about it so I don't chance taking friends here but I come here occasionally when I want some quality and cheap sushi for myself.  Also, I think they get their fish in the beginning of the week so coming from someone who used to eat here on a daily basis, the beginning of the week is a lot fresher.  Definitely try this place out.  The sushi is fresh and tasty and the half off special makes it super cheap.",

  "text": "Let's just say I had very high expectations when I read that this place was named Ben's BBQ & Beer and was not disappointed. Living in Bensalem there are a ton of chain restaurants in the area, so it is hard to find a good mom & pop place, but even harder to find a good BBQ place. The famous one is Smoken Dudes around town, and I was not really impressed by the taste or the prices, so I'm glad that we saw the sign for Ben's BBQ - which by the way is VERY easy to miss, since it is located inside the hotel and the sign is not upfront in on Street Road at all, so make sure you just pull into the Best Western Hotel after the Dunkin Donuts.\n\nAlright, well the location situation aside, because it is kind of awkward to walk into a hotel and not be staying there, but walk into the back just to eat. The restaurant area looks like a hotel lobby that wasn't given the full permission to be a BBQ pit. I was thrown off by that situation a lot, especially because it didn't even smell like BBQ! But, loyal to my review reading, I still decided to give it a shot. There was a wonderful bartender, an older woman, who was taking our order and gave us great recommendations. \n\nI decided to go with the coffee rubbed brisket - because omg that sounded amazing and the hubby went with the smoked sausage which was keilbasa for the day. Let's just say if I could eat this coffee smoked brisket everyday for the rest of my life, it might still not be enough! It was melt in your mouth good, with a smokey, but sweet flavor, just perfection. The hubby's kielbasa was great flavor too, neither one of us wanted to share our plates! As for the sides, the Mac n cheese was creamy and out of this world! And the baked beans were like I've never had, also amazing. We both got platters, which were good sizes, but enough for one person on the meats. They do give you 3 sides, which is awesome, I could've probably just done with 2. \n\nAs we licked our plates from the delicious meal, our Bartender told us the history of Ben's BBQ and how they went from a station in the corner of the lobby to a full restaurant recently. The owner also has a catering business that does well. She told us about their craft beer selection and how everyday is happy hour with $4 16oz crafts! They have an array of sandwiches and appetizers which I would love to come back in and try. The only thing I did wish they had was more ambiance, maybe some music playing or even have the volume on of the tvs in the bar. It was creepily quiet, and it would probably attract more people from the hotel. Needless to say, COME TRY THEM OUT, I can't wait to go back!",

The park seems to span about a mile and a half and I would have liked to walk the entire tract but, we were short on time.\n\nThere were plenty of people running, walking, pushing strollers and even some people soaking up the sun while napping in the grass.

I did go to the other one that was open that late and after going through their collections I decided to buy my goods here. They had the same group of country music t-shirts and collectibles and also had more of the same. My sister collects snow globes so I bought one here which was not so tacky. The funny fortune teller machines of Elvis and Willie Nelson were hilarious. \n\nThey have a pretty wide selection of other non-Nashville/country items, like an old school wooden pop gun and funny coozies. I would usually be unimpressed with the selection as a a way to try to pander and sell something but  I thought it was pretty funny and kept me amused for while.",

  "text": "Found this hidden gem about a year ago and have been a returning patron ever since. It's a pizza shop and bakery in one which is cool. Its hidden off of Bustleton Avenue, and you can easily drive right past it because it's behind a bunch of other small businesses. \n\nThe pizza shop is small but has a few tables and booths and also has outside tables set up. I went recently with my party of 5 and ordered the special. It was a pizza, cheesesteak, cheese fries, and soda. And we also bought additional cheese fries and a cheesesteak. We ate outside and had a small birthday party for my sister. It is also BYOB, so we had a few drinks as we ate dinner. \n\nThe cheesesteak was on a sesame seed roll which I believe they make in their bakery. It was so delish. The steak was packed and flavorful. The pizza is my favorite there, we had a pepperoni pizza, and this is the only shop in this area that lets the pizza crust have bubbles which I love. The fries were well-done and crispy like I like them. Everything was so tasty and I will be returning here because the food is always on point.",

  "text": "I like this place. It has a lot of wonderful things going for it: \n\n1. The first and perhaps most important thing for you to know is that they specialize in Arizona beers and wine only. \n2. It is located in prime real estate in downtown Tucson, right in the heart of activity. \n3. I like the concept and the feel of the space. It has wonderful ambiance.\n4. The booth seating is spacious and so very comfortable.  \n\nThe downfalls? \n\n1. I prize that this place is all about the Arizona beers and wines, but you won't find a Chardonnay on the menu. \n2. The service is lacking. While they do offer waiter service at the tables, I twice had to go up to the bar to order -- and this wasn't even during rush hour business times. \n3. The space is somewhat small, so it can get short on seating fairly quickly. \n\nBut, really, the most frustrating thing of all was the service. I was actually pleased with my flight of wine and appreciated both the selection and the pours. Still, neither of the bartenders I spoke with were either patient or knowledgeable enough to listen to my interests and give me strong recommendations. \n\nFor a place that specializes in beer and wine, that is a sore, sore mark. \n\nBut, that aside, I still like the space and will likely visit again soon. \n\nFrom what I could tell, the bar tends to draw many small groups of people, three or four in a group. It is a great space for socializing; great for casual talks -- I imagine it is a great go to spot for a pre-dinner drink and after dinner conversation. I also imagine this would be a popular spot for people who are in town for business conferences. \n\nJust a sidenote: The bathroom is an interesting experience. You walk through a set of doors towards the back of the establishment and ed up in a space that opens up to this weird corridor that totally reminded me of a horror movie. The bathroom has an equally eerie feel to it. But it is so, so bright in there so there is likely little changes at all that the Hash Slinging Slasher will grab you while in there.",

  "text": "OK, so here's my story. I started eating Ted Peter's Famous Smoked Fish Spread back in the early 70's. My aunt and uncle moved here from Chicago, and when we came to visit there was always a quart of fish spread (and a big bag of saltines and Crystal hot sauce) waiting for us. Flash forward to the early 80's when I moved here (I was in my early 20s). In response to an ad in the paper, I actually tried to get a job at Ted Peter's in the smoke house, but was told I was too young and probably would not be able to get to work on time. I forget the exact time, but they started smoking EARLY. I thought it the perfect job, where I could work in the morning and hit the beach in the afternoon. I was crushed, but they were probably right. \n\nI don't live in Florida anymore, but I do still visit the area (at least once or twice a year). Ted Peter's is one of those absolutely positively \"have to\" stops that gets made when returning to this area. Sometimes more than once... And sometimes there's still a container of fish spread waiting for me in the fridge at home (though the \"to go\" crackers and hot sauce are not passed out as generously). \n\nWhen dining in, and in addition to the fish spread with crackers, the three things I recommend are: The smoked fish spread sandwich, any of the smoked fish entrees (ask your server for details, as some are more \"fishy\" than the others), or the burger (for you less adventurous types). Oh, and the German Potato Salad is quite good too. \n\nDraft Beer (Miller High Lite - The Champagne of Beers) is served, but only with meals. And at $2.50 a mug, you won't want to drink much here anyways... Oddly, root beer (which is very good) is also $2.50 a mug (but I think you get free refills). Oh, cans and bottles of other beers is also available. \n\nI've never had problem with service, and even if you do, you (should be) on vacation. Just chill out and relax and enjoy some of the best smoked fish you are likely to ever have.",

  "text": "Bad airport dining at its finest. Do yourself a favor and skip this.\n\nMy husband and I were rolling through the Tampa airport and had about half an hour before our plane boarded. There was just enough time to grab a quick bite, run through the souvenir shop and hopefully grab a Starbucks before getting on the plane. This place was right in front of where we came out from the security checkpoint and looked promising enough. Panini sandwiches sounded like a good match for the looking for a quick bite problem. I scanned the menu, told my hubby what to get me and ran to find a bathroom. I was stunned when I returned that he had barely moved in line. This place is NOT fast. Upon arriving at our table, he had my requested French Dip panini. It looked promising enough. Nice and big, a little oily on the outside but crunchy. It seemed ok. I opened the waxed paper wrapping and took a bite. The bread crunched delightfully but was only tepid in temperature. The beef inside actually had good flavor but my sandwich was almost cold in the middle. And then, I dipped into the big cup of au jus and was stunned to find that it was STONE COLD. Who serves a French dip with cold au jus? Like they must keep these in the fridge and just plop one on the tray when some poor slob orders a French dip. In addition, I spent a good amount of my sandwich-eating time trying to decide if the woman had smeared a completely gutbusting amount of mayo on my sandwich, or if there was some kind of cheese spread on it. After eating the whole thing, I still couldn't decide what it was. I think after careful thought that it was mayo. I LOVE mayo. Most people watch me make a sandwich and are aghast at how much mayo there is on it. But this was excessive even for me. AND, who the heck puts mayo on a French dip??\n\nSo to sum up -- overpriced (but hey it's the airport), lukewarm to stone cold food, sandwiches that don't even make sense and are sloppily made (a gallon of mayo on the side, please), slow and generally totally unsatisfying. Definitely skip. I was most disappointed when we walked about 50 feet down to our gate and I discovered there is a lovely little Bruegger's-esque bagel shop down at the end of the terminal. I would have so much preferred to spend my money there. Next time I will know.",

Or checking to see how our food was because maybe then he would have known we were served our last appetizer after we were already served our entree. \n\nFood was great, but the subpar service tainted the experience.

We paid extra for the deluxe king room, so there was room for more than just a bed, and we didn't feel crowded. Plus - bonus - our room actually had a view of the Mississippi River, and it was strangely addicting to just stand there and watch the barges and tugs go by. I also loved that there was a Keurig coffee maker in the room.\n\nThe hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas holiday, so there were always people hanging out in the lobby and bar just enjoying the scenery or taking pictures. This is a crowded time of year for New Orleans, and the Carousel Bar in the hotel was always packed, but fortunately we were able to belly up to the bar next to the hotel restaurant, and sample their specialty holiday cocktails.  We had Christmas lunch at Criollo Restaurant in the hotel, and it was surprisingly good-with the desserts being exceptional.\n\nI do NOT think the staff is as professional as it is at other NOLA hotels we've stayed at: friends we were traveling with had constant issues with the staff and a scooter they rented, plus the doormen seemed to be more interested in chatting with each other than opening doors, saying hello, etc. Also, I think noise is a problem in all of these old hotels, and this one is no exception.  However, since we travel with a small speaker so we can sleep with white noise, this wasn't really an issue for us.\n\nThe location of the hotel is hard to beat, the elevators were surprisingly fast, and as a whole, we had a very good time here.",

But here's the reason for 3 stars instead of 4... \n\nThe cashier who was \"supposed\" to be taking my order found it moooooooore interesting to talk to her fellow cashier & that cashier's patron than to take my order. So, I PATIENTLY waited for her (Maya according to the register receipt) to acknowledge me, greet me & ask me to step forward before I did so (I initially thought she was helping her fellow coworker with an problem, but as I ear hustled, I learned she was engaging in a nonchalant conversation with the 2 other ladies)... So, 2.5 minutes passed & she FINALLY acknowledged me & took my order (which, of course, not surprisingly she got WRONG). \n\nThe food was good. Temperature was great. No biting & shuffling of food in your mouth because it was too hot. I got a little cheeseburger, thanks to my neglectful cashier, \"all the way\" less pickles. Grilled onions & mushrooms made me Happppppppppppppy!!!!\n\nThe burger prices seem comparable to Wendys, the fries are a little pricey, but I skipped out on that portion of the experience.  \n\nFree roasted peanuts for your dining pleasure, but don't throw those shells on the floor, as the sign directs; this AIN'T O'Henrys (well that part isn't in the sign...

It's not in the best part of town but during the day it seems ok.  Decent amount of parking and the staff is Oh so friendly and welcoming. \n\nThere are 3 different styles to chose from when picking your tacos.  Xtreme which includes cabbage, sour cream and cheese.  Tijuana which it the more traditional style with onions and cilantro and frankly I can't remember the 3rd, I should have gotten a picture of the menu.  The menu also includes Mexican style corn on the cob, Flatuas, so many delicious options.  \n\nI tried the Xtreme style shredded chicken. I loved all of the toppings, the chicken was a bit dry but overall good.  I also had Tijuana style al pastor absolutely delicious.  Don't forget to order the chips and salsa.  Full of wonderful flavor and homemade chips that have the right amount of crunch and flavor without being burnt.\n\nMy 2 tacos, chips and Salsa was just over $12 so in my opinion the prices are pretty standard.  I will absolutely revisit and I hope you do too!",

  "text": "Yay!  Yet another grocery store in town!  I was actually pretty glad to hear Sprouts was coming to Tampa - I had shopped at one in Alabama, and loved their ready-to-eat section.\n\nSince I went on opening week, the parking lot was full as I expected, but fortunately the store is in the center of a huge strip mall, and there was plenty of parking to be had in front of other stores.\n\nSide Story #1 - as I was walking back to my car, I watched as a car pulled in next to mine, flung open her door, and whacked my car.  When I walked up to inspect it and said, \"Hey, you hit my car!\" the response I got back was an angry (at me) \"I barely touched it!\".  I suppose an \"I'm sorry\" was too much to hope for, in this day and age.\n\nWhen I walked into Sprouts, the first thing I noticed was the enormous selection of produce. I have heard it compared to Trader Joes and Fresh Market, but this section looked larger and fresher than either of those stores.  I also loved that they had a huge variety of fresh cut flowers and plants.\n\nSince I couldn't wait to get in and out of the madness that was the store on this day, I headed straight to the area that had pre-packaged food, and bought a smorgasbord of items to go:  buffalo nuggets (very spicy), turkey meatloaf with vegetables (surprisingly filling and good), a premade sandwich with deli buffalo chicken and tomatoes, which sadly had very soggy bread from the tomatoes, and falafel balls (see Side Story #2).  My biggest complaint with all the to-go food was that it was hard to get the plastic lids off, and that the plastic lids could not go in the microwave.\n\nSide Story #2 - the falafel balls are supposed to be microwaved for 2-3 minutes before eating them. I took the lid off, took the sauce out, and heated them up. They came out perfectly, and were delicious. There were so many in there though, I saved about half of them for the next day. Next day, heated the remainder up, and after about a minute the whole microwave started to smoke and I had to rush over and dump the flaming falafel balls in the sink!  Phew!  Boy did my house stink!  Apparently the falafel balls are a one-time-heat-up type thing - who knew?\n\nSo, other than the falafel excitement, I will definitely be heading back to Sprouts to try some of their other ready-made options.",

Bad idea to come here on an empty stomach as everything looks so good, and you might just convince yourself to buy a whole cake when you have no need for one.\n\nWe used admirable restraint and kept our selections to a few small desserts. It was hard to narrow down the choices, but we eventually agreed on a peanut butter cookie, an individual cheesecake, and lastly a butterfingers brownie bar. The cookie and cake were good but not taste bud blowing. But the brownie, if I tried that while standing my knees would have buckled. This may have been the best brownie type treat I've ever had, and trust me, I've had a lot.\n\nWe will definitely be back for further research, specifically in the brownie department. And there is a pound cake with an obscene amount of chocolate ganache that taunted me as well as a chocolate skull. Based on future visits this could well be updated to 5 star status, for the time being 4.5 \" who knew butterfingers could be orgasmic \" Yelps",

  "text": "This review is for the catering hall aspect of this business, and from a guest's POV. It does not in any way suggest that the wedding reception was bad. The parents of the bride were gracious and generous hosts, and a great time was had by all due to the stunning newly wedded couple, and their happy guests.\n\nThe reception was held in the catering hall, where there seems to be ample space and staff to host 2 concurrent events. This space seemed out of date, but clean and utilitarian. The front garden section seems like a nice spot for wedding party photos.\n\nI'm not an expert on catered food( thank God) but have to admit that quality was lacking. I won't even comment on the apps and passed hors d'oeuvres, but the main dishes need to be addressed. Crab cakes, if I was blindfolded and asked to taste I might say it was some type of seafoodesque cake, but not crab. Unless by crab they meant shells and other unused parts. Chicken parm, not even served with pasta and a disgrace to Italians everywhere. Beef, no, I won't even bother. \n\nThe service aspect was fair. The many servers seemed moody and unfriendly, although efficient. I thought the began to clear things too quickly, be it between courses or at the end if the night. \n\nSo the big question I guess is if I would recommend this spot. Not knowing the cost of this per person versus other venues it is hard for me to say. I will say that if I were to receive an invite to attend another event here I would not be excited to partake in the food. A tasty lunch elsewhere then I'd concentrate on the hopefully open bar. 5 Yelps for the newlyweds, but only 2 for Masso's",

A tad hipsta but what great brunch place isn't nowadays?\n\nWe needed 3 things: carb items for my daughter, eggs and sausage for my son, area proximity due to party proceeding...ok maybe four...bloody marys...always a requirement.\n\nWe were greeted with smiles and the wait was nothing (5 mins) compared to other brunch places. Albeit this is a bar but the brunch game is strong my friends.\n\nI definitely recommend getting the Bloody Mary. It's spicy and garnished with homemade pickled veggies. Your choice of vodka.\n\nWe ordered a chocolate, caramel donut for the table to try because it was $2 and it was ridiculous. Hot out of the fryer made it crunchy on the outside with a cakey inside and whatever goodness they garnished with was off the plate and devoured within seconds.\n\nKiddos ordered the chocolate chip pancakes  as well as eggs and sausage. The portions are enormous. The toasted sourdough that comes with egg dishes is superb and you can order as a side. The pile of seasoned fries are a crispy nice addition instead of home fries.\n\nThe stunner is the chicken french toast with sunny eggs, kale and cabbage slaw, and peppered maple syrup. The combination of the crunchy kale and cabbage slaw and the saltiness of the fried chicken coupled with the gooey sunnies and peppery sweet maple syrup was insane. I will go back for that lovely dish.\n\nOverall I was really impressed and would recommend!!",

I think they at lease marinated with dry coating. I like their wings. Please try my favorite Parmesan and lemon pepper. You might want to look at their daily special combination that will save you some money including a game of pool. \n\nThe place has some draft beer dispensers on the left of counter that is not visible.

Actually, I shouldn't say that - a waiter at Sculley's managed it.\n\nSculley's is a waterfront restaurant in the John's Pass area - a boardwalk-type tourist attraction near Madeira Beach.  I ventured in with my family after an afternoon stroll along the Gulf.  I was windblown, salt-sprayed, happy and mildly sunburned.  I wanted a drink on an open-air patio and my father recommended Sculley's (he had been there before).\n\nFrom the moment we were seated, things went downhill.  Our waiter, quite possibly the most morose individual I have ever seen working a service job, came up and started telling us the dinner specials.  We interrupted him (nicely) because we didn't want him to waste his time.  We knew we were having drinks and maybe an appetizer, nothing else.  \n\nOur morose server's response:  (snotty voice) That's it?\n\nOh honey, wrong response.\n\nHe went away, we perused the menu and decided on drinks and a crab-stuffed mushroom dish.  Mr. Morose returned, took our order, again said \"That's it?\" and then SIGHED.  Excuse me?  \n\nHe brings back our drinks, slaps them down in front of whoever and walks away - no words.  \n\nMr. Morose returns with our mushrooms and actually brings extra little plates for us, drops everything with no interaction and retreats.  Perhaps he's getting a clue from the glacial waves of displeasure emanating from our little crew?\n\nI tipped the little f#*ker, but it was a near thing.  We almost asked for the manager on our way out, but preferred instead to just walk away.  Probably the wrong call, but there it is.\n\nThat one star up there is for the view, and for the decent mushrooms.  The service ruined my afternoon.",

The room in the back is my favorite, because it's semi-secluded.\n\n$10 min on cards.",

  "text": "Nataly N continued to amaze me for my birthday weekend with another surprise dinner.  This time, we dined alone ;)\n\nAldine had been on my to-try nearly since it opened.  They offer three courses, plus dessert, and drinks via their a la carte menu.  As I've always preferred a variety of food versus a huge portion of one dish when dining out, their type of menu plays to my preferences.  \n\nWe each began with a cocktail and first.  I cannot recall the name of my cocktail, but you'll know it as the one with tequila, watermelon, and a chilli pepper spice.  The spice was not overpowering, but did help ensure I didn't down the drink in one go!  As for our firsts, we shared the beets and corn + truffle custard.  The beet salad came with a cashew butter that helped balance the ingredients.  The custard appeared simple and straight forward, but after tasting I realized it had 'a lot going on' with bits of mushroom and tomato.\n\nInstead of each ordering a second, we split the heirloom tomato.  Like the previous salad, it was well assembled and presented.  I could share more notes, but it went down so quickly!\n\nWe ended the savory dishes by sharing the culotte steak and pork coppa.  I was surprised just how well the blueberry paired with the pork and black garlic chips that came with the steak ensure each bite was excellent.  No worries about temperature as they were both cooked perfectly.\n\nWe ended the night with dessert, including a well place candle arranged by Nataly N.  Their olive oil cake was rather simple but nonetheless delicious.  The panna cotta was smooth and very easy to enjoy.\n\nTo round out my review, I can touch on service and atmosphere.  It was easy to say service was amazing.  Prompt coverage without interrupting our alone time.  Greeting smiles with great recommendations. On atmosphere, yes the dining area was very basic.  However, it was also very bright and filled with natural light as we dined just before sundown.  I feel it helped us be ourselves and feel comfortable while enjoying our fine dining we didn't need to lift a finger to prepare...",

  "text": "I've been to a couple of their locations and I always have fun, although I've never tried the food.  This location had a fantastic cover band playing Saturday night (IPD - check them out, they were really amazing).  I drank and danced my fool ass off.  The crowd was really friendly (may have been my new jeans, or my drunken dance floor gyrations, but still).\nWe sat at the outside patio bar for a while - I always forget that people smoke cigarettes in other states so that took a little getting used to.  Our bartenders remained attentive the whole time we sat there ringing up a $130 tab.  And that's just what we spent outside before going inside to dance and drink some more!!!  My drinks were only $4.50 or $5 a pop, apparently depending on whether or not you pay with cash or credit, or maybe it depends on the bartender that charges you.  Hard to tell.  In any case, I take very little responsibility for wracking up that bar tab.  And when friends insist that you take shot after wretched shot, it only makes sense that they buy the damn things, so there.  Be prepared to severely damage your hearing if you decide to head inside for the band.  I really doubt such a tiny place needs such a wickedly huge sound system, especially when the dance floor is the same space where the band plays, sandwiched between the door and the bar.\nOutside bar tab = $130 before tip\nInside bar tab = $100(ish) before tip\nWatching my Aussie friend sing AC/DC songs with the band?  Priceless.",

I forget what it's called but it contained shrimp, oyster and a tiny crab claw. It was okay. Nothing stood out. \n\nAfter eating the Shrimp and Grits at Cafe Amelia, we were excited to see how others compared. At Luke, you get a sizable portion and it's good but not great. \n\nOverall, there were better samplings of brunch and creole food elsewhere.",

There is also a pork chop entree that is really good, but not as tender as the pork and fig.\n\nThe bbq shrimp was really good....they give you a bib so you don't splatter on yourself.  \n\nThey had a fish special of the night which was a drum....never heard of that kind of fish, but it was also really good.\n\nOverall,  good place.

  "text": "This was the perfect spot for me and my girls to have our last meal before heading back home from our mini-getaway.  SOOO glad we picked this place!\n\nSanta Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You're also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don't feel like waiting. \n\nWe were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  \n\nThe four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!\n\nWe started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!\n\nMy friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  \n\nOverall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)",

  "text": "Sorry Yelpers, but I thought this Jose Garces restaurant was just okay.\n\nVillage Whiskey is pretty tiny.  About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  \n\nWe were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.\n\nI ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdw\n\nWe also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  \n\nWhen our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAA\n\nRG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.  But again, the burger was just okay.  \n\nFYI-Don't look up at the ceiling fans, they were so filled with dirt, that you might get dust in your eyes!",

  "text": "This café is one of my favorite breakfast/ brunch spots anywhere. The Banana Foster's French Toast is unbelievable. I loved everything about it. The toast is very soft and sweet. The banana cream inside and the Banana Foster sauce on top are incredible. They are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. I devoured the entire dish quickly. I rank the dish as one of four French Toast dishes that are above all others. I do not even want to rank them 1, 2, 3, 4. Instead, I will rank them 1, 1a, 1b, 1c:\n\nTop 4 French Toasts:\n\n1. Blue Moon Café in Baltimore (1621 Aliceanna St, Baltimore, MD 21231): The Cap'N Crunch French Toast tops my list. Grinding cereal and using it to create a crunchy crust is genius. I also enjoy the fresh fruit on top.\n\n2. Blu Jam Café (7371 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90046): The Crunchy French Toast features a cornflake crust. It also has berries on top. I slightly like the Cap'N Crunch French Toast better because I enjoy the Cap'N Crunch crust a little more.\n\n3. Surrey Café and Juice Bar: The Banana Foster's French Toast is on par with both. I give the other two the thinnest of margins because I love the cereal crust. Nevertheless, the banana cream and Banana Foster sauce is an equalizer.\n\nI also ordered a side of home fries. The potatoes had excellent seasoning and a nice crunchy skin. In addition, Surrey is a juice bar. I had a fresh squeezed orange juice. Is a large, 16 ounce juice really worth $6.50? Personally, I would not normally pay for it. However, I wanted to try a fresh juice since I saw great reviews for them. It was very good. Nevertheless, it is a lot more than I would want to pay for juice. I got to Surrey at 8 AM when it opens. The place is great so the seating will fill up quickly. On a Sunday, it was almost full by the time I left at 9 AM.\n\n4. Stanley Restaurant :Surrey's Café and Juice Bar have a slight edge with the toast and Fosters sauce. However, Stanley's additional toppings (bananas, banana chips, and vanilla ice cream) and beautiful presentation is an equalizer.\n\nIf you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, please see If you are visiting New Orleans and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

It is located in a new strip mall just off highway 64's Green Mount  Rd. exit in O'Fallon, IL (less than a half hour drive from St. Louis).  It is nicely decorated, simple, earthy, and contemporary.\n\nThey have a few Chinese items on the menu, but it is primarily Thai.  I had the pleasure of doing a curry taste test at a recent Thai festival in Florrisant and Sala Thai was the best by far.  It is good to know their cook is carrying on the good cooking at a newer & nicer location!  \n\nToday, we sampled the tofu yellow curry, pad Thai, Thai sweet & sour shrimp, & Thai cashew chicken.  The Thai version of these dishes has more complex flavor combinations and is lighter and more delicious than simlar dishes from some of their Asian counterparts.  I loved it all!\n\nVegetarians will like Aroy, as well.  They have a large selection of interesting and tasty vegetarian items.\n\nThe food service is a wee bit slow and the items are priced a little high, but it is absolutely yummy!  My only real complaint is that it is small and they get packed early.  So give yourself some time.\n\nIt still amazes me that the four best Thai restaurants in the region are in the Metro East.

Good move!\n\nWe parked it at the bar and got the show from Sasha, the bartender, who kept up friendly banter with us even as she concocted a variety of beverages throughout the course of our stay. \n\nThe cocktail menu was fairly extensive, broken down into Prohibition- and Repeal-era drinks, not to mention long lists of bourbons, ryes, and scotches. I ordered an Aviation (a drink I make myself, with my own brandied cherries, but here they do it the right way, all out with Creme de Violette to tint it blue like the sky; Sasha let me take a look at the bottle, perhaps to know that it wasn't some awful curacao!) \nFor another friend she created a drink with Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction's Root liqueur (which is made with the roots and herbs used in old-fashioned root beer), chocolate bitters, seltzer and orange. \n\nWe also partook of food here: First, duck fat fries (which have been a trend in Chicago, where I live, for at least a year, but I'd never had them; I'd never eaten anything involving duck before this, so now I suppose I have lost my duck fat innocence). These were thick-cut, rich in taste [gratis the duck fat, one presumes], not actually greasy, but definitely better when ordered with the cup of cheese sauce on the side. \n\nWe also got soft pretzel sticks, which would have been fine but not especially remarkable without the mustard sauce (which had a distinct taste of raspberry, to my mind) pooled in the cup underneath them.\n\nOverall, this was a friendly place with fab drinks and great food. I wish it was in my city.",

Take my word for it gentleman, this is one go-to place if you want to please the love of your life.",

  "text": "Yeah! Congrats La Mulita! What better day to give this new restaurant a whirl than Cinco de Mayo with $5 salt rimmed margaritas? \n\nFirst off, the margarita was mighty tasty. The second one was equally delicious ;) I'm not typically a marg fan but in the spirit of the day I opted for not one but two. In general, La Mulita's cocktail menu is very wallet-friendly with most drinks falling in the $6 to $7 price range. Also, I appreciated that they had new local breweries like Outliers on the menu.\n\nBefore I move on to the eats, I have to mention how cozy and sexy the space is - from the low lighting to the industrial vibe with wood timber, exposed beams, etc. (see picture) The lighting found that perfect spot between too bright and fluorescent and uber dark (ya know...we're trying super hard to feel like a speakeasy/you can hardly see your date). Nicely done. \n\nEats: \n-My personal favorite was the refreshing Columbian coleslaw - I appreciated that it wasn't heavy and left me feeling less guilty about the half dozen other eats I sampled during our visit.\n\n-Delicious guac - I knew this going in but I would also like to add that the chips were tasty to boot. \n\n-salsa and chips - nothing mind blowing but I would definitely order again\n\n-kale chips - I hate to buy these when out because I can make them pretty well at home but I couldn't resist trying my neighbors - - soooo good! Plus, it's a great healthier bar bite option.\n\n-roasted red cabbage and sundried tomato pesto dip: we probably should have stopped ordering more food before this because by the time it rolled around I needed to unbutton my pants. My dining companions couldn't believe that there wasn't any meat in this app, it somehow pulled off a hearty taste with all veggies. \n\n-lastly, vegetarian chiliquales: on the dry side. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the pepper. I'm thinking if there were a few more veggies and more \"sauce\" this dish would be top notch. \n\nCan't wait for my next visit!",

It was cooked with pancetta which was delicious.

  "text": "We had to use this main post office to get passports and although they get really busy, the passport guys at this location are a class act.\n\nSo, the passport office here opens at 8:30am and it's the only post office in Tampa that you can walk in for passports. I had to get my children passports and it was about time for me and HubbyStanks to renew. Since the only appointment we could get closer to home was during a school day we decided to walk in. The gentleman who I spoke to on the phone about the walk in was nice enough to let me know about arriving before it opens if I want to get things done without the longest wait. \n\nWe got there at 8:15 and already there were people waiting outside with numbers. How nice that a postal worker came out and passed out numbers to the early birds. When it opened we were number 29! Although there were only 2 lines working at a time, the men behind the desk would give a person paperwork if they didn't already have it filled out, call the next number, then ask if the last number was ready. Wow! You won't find that at the DMV or any other government office. \n\nAnother gentleman came from the back to ask if there were any renewals and since HubbyStanks and I were renewing he took care of our paperwork without us having to wait for our number. We then sat back down with our kids. When it was our kids turn our postal guy, who was retired navy, was so cool, cheerful and friendly. He made us smile and we even talked about different Naval bases that we lived.\n\nHubbyStanks realized he needed to expedite his passport so we went into the main post office to retrieve our mail and make the change. Everyone was so helpful in allowing us to change our mind and make the changes! \n\nIf you need to walk into a post office or even book an appointment I highly recommend using the main post office. They really have it together here. They make a somewhat painful experience a lot less painful with their awesome customer service.",

This facility holds nearly 5,000 spectators, who try their best to rock the whole city of Reno down. \n\nAaron Kwok along with Andy Lau, Leon Lai and Jacky Cheung (Matt's fav singer) formed Hong Kong's Cantopop  version of the \"4-Kings\" were the most popular foursome for all Cantonese and Mandarin fans from the 1980's- the mid 1990's. In current time, they are still popular, although they haven't done much in Hong Kong's pop cultures and being overmatched by new breeds taking over the music and entertainment scene. \n\nWhen they were in their prime, Matt listened to each of their musics and owned many of their \"now\" classic CD's in the 90's where they dominated the Hong Kong entertainment industry with their silky smooth voices that attracts many listeners of all ages from the Chinese communities  in all globe around the world. Ever since Matt got married and older, he haven't followed much, but wife still keeps up with the current events in the Hong Kong's entertainment.

Mr. Kwok would sing many of his current & greatest hits that Matt and wifey listened and grew up on. Some of the missy fans including wife bought nice bouquet of flowers and other gifts for Mr. Kwok and whenever he would sing a slow song, he would invite the girls upstage, hand him the gifts and give each girls including wife a hug and peck on the cheek. He did dance with a few of them, but not wifey, who was heartbroken and disappointed, but still she did hugged the man of the night.",

  "text": "One would think with Pizzeria Vetri being so close to home, I would visit more frequently. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and since my initial review and I've only been back twice. \n\nMy first trip back was for my birthday and it was at least 6 months after my initial visit. I hyped the crap out of the place to my husband and probably set the bar way too high in my own head. As a result, I was a little disappointed. I had the Rotolo which was extraordinary but for whatever reason my Melanzana pizza fell a little flat to me personally. I ended up liking my husband's Salsiccia a little more.\n\nThis past Saturday night, my husband and I were looking for a causal but tasty date night so we decided to head back to Pizzeria Vetri. I took the restaurant off its pedestal and ended up having an exceptional dinner. Funny how that works, right? \n\nSo of course we had to get the Rotolo. I can see why it won a 2014 Best of Philly award. It was light, doughy and pesto perfection. I would still enjoy it without the mortadella and ricotta but that adds an even more flavor. I could probably be a happy camper with a meal of 3-4 Rotolos.\n\nI enjoyed the Salsiccia last time so decided to go for a repeat. It didn't disappoint. Pizzeria Vetri's Instagram page had also tantalized me with pictures of the special pizza of the day, so we had to give it a shot as well. It consisted of broccoli rabe stuffed porchetta, mozzarella, black pepper and pecorino cheese. The ingredients were basic enough for a gourmet pizza but together made for a really great taste. The combination of flavors was a little sharp but in a good way.\n\nThe service has been excellent for each of my three visits. Our servers have always been polite, professional and extremely polished. On our most recent visit the manager stopped by towards the end of our meal to see how we were doing. \n\nI don't love the communal style set-up. While dining out, I prefer the company of my own party. My husband and I have taken to liking to the counter seats that face the open kitchen. I personally found the pizza preparation to be extremely enjoyable to watch and for whatever reason oddly therapeutic and relaxing. \n\nMoral of my update: Pizzeria Vetri serves up some fabulous gourmet pizza but it isn't the best gourmet pizza in the world and certainly not the best atmosphere. Go in with a realistic expectation and I think you'll enjoy it just fine.",

  "text": "This was my third visit to the this place, yet it was the first time my burger was even slightly interesting. It was more than that, it was great! I always wanted this place to be awesome, but every burger I ordered was under seasoned and bland. Not to mention the high price! You pay upwards of $10 for a burger patty that is only slightly bigger than a slider and you don't get a side with it. Now I'm willing to pay that when the meat quality is top notch (which I believe theirs is) and when the flavor is amazing (which it hadn't been until yesterday). So, maybe it's time for me to give this place another try.\n\nI have actually always been a fan of their fries, their house made sauces and their onion rings. \n\nTheir ice cream was never really my favorite. I really prefer a creamier ice cream and I feel theirs is on the ice side. However, I think I've come to appreciate their special brand on ice cream and accepted that it's just different. My favorite flavor is cinnamon and my husband really likes the cookies and cream. I got to sample their chai and that was delicious as well!\n\nAnnoyances worth mentioning:\n\nThe service! I've always had servers with decent attitudes, but they've never been terribly attentive. I always feel like I'm looking around for them and waiting for them to come back. I don't know if they're understaffed??\n\nThe noise! This place is super echo-ey and super loud! It made it pretty hard to carry on a conversation. \n\nParking. It's not easy or cheap.\n\nCommunity seating. I've been at the community table two out of my three visits. Both times I was lucky enough not be sat right next to strangers. But it's still nit my favorite style of seating...\n\nOver all, I know I'm going to go back to this place. Especially since I finally found a burger worth paying for.",

It's a pretty dive-y bar.  Occasionally you'll find tourists here, but it's mostly locals - mostly younger locals.  Overall everyone is pretty darn friendly - you can strike up a conversation with just about anyone.  \nThe drinks are pretty darn cheap and some of the bartenders are pretty darn liberal about the amount of alcohol they bestow upon you - which I can certainly appreciate.   \nThere's a single pool table that most often, than not, is bustling with friendly pool games and chatty banter - I've witnessed many strangers meet and bond over pool.  Heck, I've been a party myself.  \nAs for the food options - behold, there is a vegan black bean burger available for the likes of me!  And a black bean wrap, which without the dairy, is vegan, I believe.  Both of these are pretty great for bar food.  \nSo yes, I'll be coming back here time and time again . . . although admittedly, I sometimes try to avoid Flanagan's because I always end up staying longer than I should.

The last time I was here was as a kid - now that I'm older I can appreciate the place for its waterfront party atmosphere. The place had a huge crowd and plenty good-looking people mingling, while some DJs spun the latest hits. 93.3 hosted this party and as usual it drew crowds beyond the typical Clearwater Beach and holiday crowds. Make sure you get there early to find some good parking.\n\nThe drinks were made well - packed a punch and although the waitress had a bit of an attitude, we did feel a little bad for her with so many party animals around. The drinks had plenty of alcohol, although they were average to expensive in pricing. I would probably pre-game before heading to Shepards. I saw at least 4 people pass out from drinking during our visit. We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express next door which is perfect walking distance from Shepards. \n\nCatching the sunset from here was awesome and the mini-beach made for some great photo opportunities as well. The nightclub called The Wave seemed pretty cool as well, although we only sutck around for short time. I will certainly be back for future partying.",

The park staff is very friendly to all who enter their gates, but for the kiddies, they have slides, pitching balls, face painting and so much more! http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/not_your_typical_ballpark.jsp#kids My granddaughter was picked to be on first base last year and got to stand along with the Phillies first baseman, Ryan Howard, she also has an autographed ball by him!  She was on TV and thank heavens my son, who is a huge Phillies fan, taped the game! \n\nThis stadium has more concession stands and eateries than I have ever seen at any stadium, be it football or baseball. You want food, they've got it!  Citizen's Bank Park food offerings, redefines Ballpark cuisine!   I have tried most of these places and be it a cheesesteak, crab fries, kielbasi, hot dogs, piled high sandwiches or BBQ, you will leave here filled with satisfaction. Bull's BBQ is the largest grill in all of major league baseball's stadiums. It has an outdoor picnic area and grills and BBQ's anything from turkey, pork, beef and sausages to chicken. http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/phi/ballpark/concessions.jsp \n\nIn honor of the recently deceased Harry Kalas, they had paid homage to him with Harry The K's, which has served beverages and foods from finger food to an upscale menu. McFadden's which is a sit down eatery and Sports bar is conveniently accessed from both inside and outside of the enclosed park. \n\nI am there to watch the ballgame, food is brought to you, as well as beverages, constantly! If and when I do venture away from my seat to grab a bite, I still do not miss the game, thanks to the numerous screens and shouts from the stands. \n\nSeating is comfortable with a lot of leg room, wide screen TVs adorn this open stadium and beautiful displays of a lit up replica of the Liberty Bell, which rings every time the Phillies hit a home run. Guests also enjoy a fantastic view of the Center City skyline. Oh, by the way, that is real grass on the field.\n\nTickets can be purchased in advance and online.  This year  they have a new package that includes your ticket for the game and a $10.00 food voucher than can be used at any stand or eatery.  They sell for $32.00 -$34.00.\n\nOne thing that I will never forget and that is how badly I wanted Chipper Jones to autograph a baseball, for my Grandson.  He refused, right in front of my grandson. Later, as we sat behind the dugout, we watched a line form and who came out, Chipper Jones to sign at least 20 balls. Since then I have bought his baseball and bat, but it killed me to do so. As we were walking towards the parking lot, after the game left out, we passed the area where the Phillies players were leaving, Jim Thome got out of his Hum V and signed quite a few balls.  I gave mine to my son, since he is a big fan, but I will never forget those two episodes.   \n\nThe way I look at it, if you do not find love for this stadium, it is because you are jealous or envious. \n\nEvery time I walk into Citizen's Bank Park, I am loving it and knowing that my next few hours will be full of good times and good eats. Batter up!  Play ball!",

I prefer to go there when I can get an outside table, or when I visit with a particular group of friends who also share in my sentiment of fondness. Now what the heck took me so long to experience Zorba's delivery?! Shame on me. It's the same delicious food, just in my pajamas in front of my TV. \n\nHaving experienced a day that could only be fixed by delivery, my husband handled all of the order details. I believe he placed directly with them, as we were able to pay in cash when the delivery guy arrived. The wait time was standard- I don't recall it arriving early nor do I recall being antsy about its whereabouts. \n\nI'm no stranger to the Imam Baldi. I think every time I have this eggplant in red sauce soufflé, I go on the record that this dish can turn me into a vegetarian. It came with the standard sides of rice, veggies and potatoes, all separated by little dividers as to not mingle. \n\nWe were first timers to the Skordalia. Think extra, extra whipped mashed potatoes with extra, extra garlic. Move over (already fabulous hummus), you may have just been replaced in our repertoire. Okay, I kid. We'll just get both and have leftovers.\n\nSpeaking of leftovers, we totally were able to split our order into two meals. Score!  \n\nLove that fresh bread they put on the table? Don't worry, you get that too. \n\nI'll still visit their actual location, but it's really good to know that I can get my Zorba's fix in the comfort of my own home.",

  "text": "They have a few locations, and we picked the one that is in more of a residential area than a busy center of the city. There was no line when we arrived shortly after 11am. But, it was still busy, it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior. They have five counter seats, and that is about it. While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.\n\nEven though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!\n\nWe couldn't just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections. We chose Cookies & Cream and Strawberry Lavender. We both liked the strawberry one better, since it had better, stronger flavor. Cookies & Cream was good but didn't have much flavor. \n\nDefinitely a place to visit if you are visiting Philly!",

I've gotten a piece of pizza here the last three times I've flown back home from Tampa.\n\nThey don't offer a wide range of pizza types - I think 3 different types is the most I've seen. I've gotten the sausage and pepperoni all 3 times. They give you one slice when you order - but it is of mammoth size - it's about the size of an entire medium pizza.  Entirely to much pizza for me - they throw the slice in the oven to make sure it's hot, then they pull it out and cut into six sections.\n\nThey have Parmesan cheese and dried red pepper to add to the pizza.\n\nThe deli sandwiches are pre-made and awaiting perusal in a frig along with salads and cold bottled drinks. They also offer hot Panini sandwiches.\n\nI was absolutely stuffed after eating an order of pizza here for dinner at my last visit.\n\nDaVinci's can be reached through HMS Host:  (813) 396-3977, Ext-555.",

  "text": "I would consider converting to Islam, if it were the only way I could ever eat Surrey's Bananas Foster French Toast ($9.75) again. (I'm sort of Buddhist.) After eating a piece of this gorgeously quartered, super air-y, banh mi-like masterpiece--which rested on this PG-13 wet dream-sauce of rum, brown sugar, and butter, and dusted with white powder--I almost started crying. Like, when Scar clawed Mufasa's paws on that cliff and then savagely watched his brother get trampled to death by a heard in the Lion King-crying.\n\nBut happy crying. Not sad crying. So there's a better analogy here...\n\nEach bite reminded me of the first time I lost my virginity. (TMI?) \"Is this happening? Is this REALLY happening, and am I using protection (napkins)?\" my mind asked. Immediately soon after the self-questioning, my brain answered its questions: \"Yes, Jonathan, their naughty French toast took you to this part of your sub-conscious.\" Oh my goodness. How did I not blackout?  \n\nThen I wanted more with Surrey's. Not a fling, but a full-out relationship, which would include hand-holding and love themed memes. So I ate their Shrimp and Grits ($13.25).\n\n\"JEE-SUUS! Hashtag blessed.\" --Bruno Mars.\n\nThe grits, smooth and creamy as a light-skinned baby's ass, probably ranks as the best I've ever put in my mouth. (It doesn't hurt they garnished it with savory bacon, freshly chopped green onions, and homemade croutons.) Also, the Gulf shrimp didn't taste frozen and oozed juices with each chomp of flesh and had enough Cajun kick.\n\nMy boo ate their Crab Meat Omelette ($12.95) and loved every bite, too. I believe she said she's never had a better omelet. \n\nThey also have fresh vegetable and fruit juices:\n\n-Carrot, apple, orange, grapefruit at $5.25 and $6.50 for a 12oz and 16oz, respectively. \n-Kale, celery, beet, or cucumber additions for .55 cents. \n-Ginger for $1.05. \n\nEverything tasted great, but it's rare I find a healthy juice super memorable. (Fresh squeezed juices usually taste excellent, yet the same, every time.\n\nOVERALL: Don't mistakenly order the wrong dish, aka something not special, at this legendary NOLA eatery. Only order off of the Local Favorites section of the menu, which consists of the three dishes I mentioned above. And guess what? My boo and I ate them all like gangstas. (Cash me inside eating all da calories. How bout dat?)\n\nIt was the best American breakfast of my life, and I'm not embellishing.",

  "text": "When you're having a reunion with friends, you can't go wrong with Cambodian food .... at least that's what I decided last night and I was right - it was awesome.  Cambodian food is an extremely tasty cuisine that has influences from neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam but has its own distinctive style.  And Khmer Kitchen is the best and most authentic Cambodian restaurant in Philadelphia. This is not the easiest restaurant to get to as it is nestled deep in South Philadelphia but it is totally worth seeking out.\n\nMy favorite dish here is the Prah-hok kahteeh pork dish prepared spicy.  When you add rice to this and the accompanying vegetables, you have quite a treat (think chile con carne but better).  The way the plate is set up here looks so pretty that you almost hate to eat it.  All the famous Cambodian sour soups like the iconic Salaw machu kre'ung are also hearty and individually prepared.  The papaya salad is awesome and just looks and tastes totally healthy.  And I love that they are able to obtain and use some real Cambodian vegetables like Cambodian eggplant or cabbage. The food is prepared to order so it's not coming out fast from the kitchen.  Mom and Grandmom and Auntie are all in the back putting each dish together so be prepared to wait.  Just bring along some good wine or beer with you and anticipate what is to come.\n\nLast evening, Tony was our server (Cambodian name Chomnan).  He is awesome.  He is so cool and personable and knows everything about Cambodian food and what he doesn't know he'll ask his Mom or Grandmom in the kitchen.  His smile and easy-going manner adds to the ambience of this awesome Cambodian restaurant.  Don't miss it ... it's as good as advertised.",

Because I got it warm, it was in a paper cup and I never knew when a pearl was making its way into my mouth. As a result, I spent half my drink wondering \"is there one in my straw?\" It's totally worth the suspense, though.\n\nThe only thing that still troubles me is the music. It's just...not right.

Because of that, you might suspect people are sniffing cocaine due to their boisterous attitudes, but after eating beignet's at Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street, I'm convinced that they are the reason for such things. Lol\n\nCafe Beignet offers better beignets than Cafe Du Monde and it's not even close.  They're far more fluffy, soft, well-sized, and deliciously powdered than any beignet I've had and it's only $3.99 for three!\n\nCafe Beignet has two locations--one being this one inside Musical Legends Park on Bourbon Street and the other on Royal.  I much rather prefer the one on Royal as it has a more clean and endearing environment.  This specific location on Bourbon is more fun and lively, but the distasteful smells of Bourbon Street creeps in from time to time.  I do love the live jazz music that is played though.  \n----\nConclusion: Those who are looking for 5 star beignets and a lively, musical atmosphere, come to this outdoor location.  I, along with Mr. Alton Brown (famous food critic on the food channel) agree Cafe Beignet is much better than Cafe Du Monde.  Come here for food, alcohol, music, and the best beignets! can be found here too!  \n\nExtra Notes:\n-Accepts credit card\n-Tables are available but be aggressive when trying to obtain one.  There are three tables upstairs near the restroom too\n-Service can be better as they're not very friendly or helpful\n-Restrooms are filthy",

  "text": "I don't eat a ton of Chinese takeout because I haunt various local Asian markets and buy and cook the stuff myself. But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.\n\nMy order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.\n\nFor some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.\n\nTheir online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are \"prepared with vegetarian ingredients\", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't. So I appreciate that notification, and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time I decide I want Chinese takeout.",

  "text": "Liquor bar = a misnomer, but only kind of.\n\nThis place is a bar first and foremost: its selection of innovative cocktails spans pages upon pages whereas their food offerings span two. So, liquor bar it truly is, but amazing food it definitely has.\n\nBut: the bites are pretty killer, from what I experienced. For what they seemingly lack in a way of app and entree selection they more than make up for with the quality, care, and innovation of their offerings.\n\nI landed after a long day of travel, famished. My lovely host, Brit S, picked me up from the airport, and after situating myself at the Conrad, we hopped the whole two blocks over to the Libertine.\n\n(It should be noted that former Indy CM Jon A also highly suggested checking this place out.)\n\nThe space is long and lean, with a formidable bar set-up and bottles for days behind the bar. Bitters and fruit and tinctures and all that, you know the drill at this point. The \"kitchen\" is also behind the bar, and the whole thing is grey and low light and trees/antlers and candlelight and warm and really nice smells. It sort of reminded me of a less formal Hinterland (located in MKE). Employees rock the whole Stumptown coffee look, but they're not nearly as in yr face with it as Stumptown is.\n\nOh, yeah. I was telling a mildly entertaining story with linear progression, wasn't I? \n\nSo: I was *famished,* and wanted nothing more than to start w/ one of their amazing cocktails, but knew I needed to put something in that stomach of mine first.\n\nSo... to the eats.\n\n1. A beet salad starter which Brit and I shared. Goat cheese and spinach and beets and yup, you guessed it. So so good, as beet salads can be when they're done right. Then?\n\n2. A chanterelle mushroom & fresh vegetable pot pie. Oh my god, I can't even. I love chanterelles, I love pot pies (secret favorite thing), so... you get the idea. Clearly handmade with fresh ingredients, I couldn't stop eating it. It was effing delicious. I was full, and yet, I kept eating. So so good.\n\nThe rest of the bites on the menu were on that whole gastro tip with an emphasis on the more foodie-focused. (God, I still hate the word foodie. I really do.) What I mean? I don't remember seeing offal or brains, but along those lines for sure. Marrow, elk, etc.\n\nAnyways, moving on (and this is important). To the cocktail: our very attentive/sweet server and I talked through a myriad of offerings and possibilities, and after much ado about bourbon, we settled on a variation of Seelbach with a locally aged bourbon. It was absolutely perfect. Mmmm, Seelbach.",

Just come!!!!\n\nIt's happy hour time everyday during those time. Ever..y..dayyyyyy!!! And what you get for messing up your internal clock for eating? 50 cents oysters.  I had $1 oyster happy hours before but never 50 cents. And not just some cheap oysters, but NOLA's famous crazy meaty P&J oysters. Look at my photo of it. Just look. I have never seen one meatier than these at this size. If you like thinner style oysters, these might not be for you.\n\nAnd if you want it cooked instead of raw, they have the same thing for $6 for half a dozen fried ones.  I didn't have any of those because I ordered 2 dozen raw oysters for just myself. As an afterthought, I should have ordered less raw just to at least try out the fried but I liked the raw one too much.\n\nOh yea. They also have half priced drinks during happy hours too but why would you care about that right?\n\nOf course I couldn't just live on raw oysters alone so I started with a small cup of gumbo and because so many mentioned it, I fought internally between their famous burger and what some said was the best Shrimp and Grits around the area. The Shrimp and Grits won out just because it was more of a local food where a burger, no matter how good, is everywhere.\n\nI would pass on the gumbo. 3 stars. Good but there are better around the French Quarters.\n\nThe Shrimp and Grits was amazing. The Shrimp was tender. The grits was buttery smooth. There is a nice slightly charred cheesy shell on top of the sauce which I didn't get at the other place. I would say this is my second favorite Shrimp and Grits so far. Just be aware this one is with a slight french twist as per the kind of higher end restaurant that it was so it's less traditional but not far off. 4.5 stars\n\nThe staff was amazingly attentive and friendly. The atmosphere as mentioned was slightly higher end but not to the point of feeling snobby. You could walk in with your casual clothes as long as you look decent.\n\nThis was probably my best deal during my whole trip. And a delicious one at that.",

  "text": "After seeing some seriously beautiful interior photos from Eater and Yelp, I was waiting for the right opportunity to give Caviar & Bananas a shot, and was happy I decided to come in on a Sunday for brunch. \nIt was extremely hot outside and we made the mistake of walking here from our condo (not my smartest idea). So were were both miserable when we came in (bless you air conditioning). The restaurant is split up into cold items and lunch foods and warmer meals and coffee on the other side. Of course for brunch the coffee/hot food was the busiest and had a long line (though nothing compared to Biscuit Love). It took us around 10 minutes to get through the line and order our food, which I consider pretty amazing for peak brunch time on Sunday without a reservation. I ordered the avocado toast with one fried egg and my BF had the fried chicken biscuit with gravy. We each had coffee and lucky for me they had just started serving frose (rose with watermelon puree and vermouth). It was delicious, refreshing, and not sweet at all which is how I like my rose. The coffee was strong and delicious and came out pretty quickly after ordering it. The drinks were really on point. Our entrees came out on paper plates and we had to use plastic silverware. This was really confusing. The ambiance is sleek and upscale, so this was quite a bit of a turn off and left something to be desired. It's also difficult to eat a messy fried chicken biscuit with gravy using a flimsy knife and fork. Also my avocado toast looked slopped on the plate. I thought that was again weird for a nice establishment. Especially when the total cost with tip was $32.00 (I did get alcohol but still). \nHowever, what the food lacked in visual appeal more than made up for in taste. Both dishes were very good. I would leave the egg off the toast next time, but it was still fresh and tasty. We sampled the jalapeno grits which sounded amazing but were pretty forgettable. \nWe had a nice experience here overall, and I really want to come back and check out their cheese plates and wine in the evening.",

I am such a naturalist. \n\nBrad had the Crispy Chicken Salad and it was huge. Romaine lettuce, Breaded Boneless Chicken, Cheddar Cheese (no Provel), Green Onion, Bacon and Tomato with Honey Mustard. Salad was acceptable, could have been better if they didn't use bacon that came from a bag. Fresh bacon would made it pop so much more.  The salad was so huge that  two could have shared.  Brad didn't even finish it, however I finished my sandwich. \n\nWhat made my most recent visit enjoyable was watching the other diners. \nIt was fun to watch the interchange between the \"career girls\" and their Uncles and Dads while they seemed to be having a \"working lunch\".

I started with a lovely mixed green salad with a pungent & delicious blue cheese. And then had the stuffed baked shrimp withe hominy cakes. Seriously tasty. My dining companion had a very lemony/anchovy-y caesar salad (and I mean that in a good way) and then stuffed salmon with gnocchi and asparagus. Since I sampled her food too, I thought the gnocchi were a bit heavy, but still delicious.  Then for dessert? AMAZING dark chocolate creme brulee. Seriously y'all, I love fancy chocolate pudding and this was the fanciest (and tastiest).\n\nOnly off note was that our server was struggling. The restaurant was busy because of superbowl weekend, but we never did get to hear the specials and had to ask for more bread.  Not that big of a deal really, especially when you view it in light of AMAZING dark chocolate creme brulee.",

  "text": "Pho King. Such a cleverly named restaurant. Have you seen their brand/logo design? Amaze balls (buy a t-shirt!). I've hit up Pho King a few times by now (good spot when you want something quick and easy before hitting up Rexall Place) but this was the first time I've been to their newly renovated digs. Everything is much cleaner and aesthetically pleasing. The right hand side of the resto now consists of a counter instead of seating area.\n\nA and I stopped in for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was reasonably busy with several tables full along with a few people popping in to pick up takeout orders. The menu is extensive with your typical Vietnamese offerings but they hilariously have a full page dedicated to Western foods/breakfast meals. Random but it must cater to the clientele in the area???\n\nI'll never understand why so many other Viet/Asian places in town do this. Take a page from Pho Tau Bay's playbook and focus on one thing and do it well. Bonus, they're open everyday of the week (Sunday's now!).\n\n- Bun bo hue (P18) ($10.95 king) - I went with their bun bo hue because I've never had it here before. The broth was fragrant with a good depth and flavour profile. I found it to be a bit on the lighter/cleaner side if that makes any sense. The meat balls were delicious! A little bit of green onions and sliced onions gives their bowls an extra zip of flavour. Good stuff.\n- Grilled lemongrass chicken with kimchi (R23) ($13.95) - A was having some trouble deciding but eventually went with the grilled lemongrass chicken skewers over rice with a side of kimchi and vegetables. The lemongrass chicken had an odd texture to it that I can't even put in writing. It was cooked fine but it must have been the cut of meat that they were using. She only ate one skewer and I ended up taking the rest as leftovers. As for the kimchi, it wasn't very good -  kind of flavourless and a chore to eat. Blah. This is why I rarely, if ever, veer from ordering pho at Vietnamese spots.\n\nOn a previous trip, I went with a buddy before an Oilers game where we each ordered pho:\n- Seafood noodle soup (P17) ($10.95 regular) - a couple shrimps, kabuki, and shrimp balls. The broth was great - flavourful and clean tasting! Sort of sate style but with just a bit of spiciness to it. Definitely would get this again.\n- Rare steak and meatball beef noodle soup (P8) ($8.95 regular) - my buddy went to town on his bowl. There was nothing left after we finished devouring both of our bowls.\n\nSolid spot to grab a bowl of pho. Prices are reasonable and service is fast. Slightly ghetto area of town but that's part of it's charm. Don't let that hold you back from trying out Pho King.",

The Express Wash is just $6, which is a bargain considering that its a soft cloth wash... That price will usually get you a crappy touch-free wash that leaves your car just as dirty as it was when you arrived. The vacuum island are always clean and in working condition. It also has an air freshener sprayer, both for $1. If I had any gripe, it would be that the people who are there when the management isn't there do a half assed job of pre spraying your car and not brushing your tires before going through the wash... But that's an issue for mgt to address. Even with that one thing that could use improving, this car wash gives far better service than most other ones.",

I forgot how divine the Dewey's salads and pizzas are.\n\nWith the four of us, we split the \"regular\" sized salads and split pizzas.\n\nI was on the split of the Harvest salad ($7.95 for the regular): field greens with figs, chopped applewood bacon, roasted pumpkin seeds and boursin cheese with apple cider vinaigrette.\n\nThis is a monumental salad and could easily serve three or maybe even four, since you're going to eat pizza, too.\n\nWhen I was done with my half of the salad, I was stuffed . . . BUT I wasn't letting anything stay on the plate, it was so delicious! The figs were plentiful, bacon, too. Boursin cheese was overall adequate but in proportion, a little skimpy.\n\nOn the pizzas: two split the caprese and Hawaiian -- both looked ridiculously fresh and lucious, and were declared delicious.\n\nMy pizza partner and I split the 17-inch Bronx Bomber ($20.45): red sauce, Mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage (sliced), mushrooms, onions, green peppers, black olives. Toppings, sauce and crust (good, yeasty dough) were deliriously in perfect proportion, with generous toppings.\n\nThis is just divine salad and pizza. Service was top-notch, too!",

  "text": "Once again, I have died and gone to foodie heaven after eating at Farmhaus. This place is so worthy of its #4 ranking on the famous Ian Froeb's STL 100 List. It truly is one of the best places to eat in the Lou. \n\nTonight, surprise-surprise, I sat at the bar since I was dining alone. When asked if I'd like anything to drink, I responded, \"It depends, can you make a good Old Fashioned?\" The young lady who asked me, kinda hesitated. However, your co-worker spoke up and told me how she'd make and the gauntlet had been thrown down. She went to work and when she presented it to me, my breath was taken away. It was the same caliber of masterful cocktail mixing that I expect at a bar that specializes in classic cocktails. It went down smoothly. \n\nAlso tonight, I thanked my lucky stars that I do not have a peanut allergy.  As an appetizer, I enjoyed the Chicken Wing Lollipops. They were made with a Thai peanut sauce, compressed cucumber and carrot, ponzu mayo and roasted peanuts. The flavor was incredible, best way to describe it, is dipping a wing in peanut butter instead of blu cheese  or ranch dressing. They were so juicy and tender, you could suck the bones clean. Every morsel was enjoyed. \n\nMy entree was my second favorite seafood next to sea scallops and that is, Soft-Shell Crab. I've lived in Boston and traveled a lot in Florida and this by far is the best Soft-Shell Crab I have ever had. It was Corn Flour Fried and served on a bed of lemon anchovy aioli and tomato and corn salsa. The glass of Pinot Grigio was a refreshing beverage for this seafood entree. \n\nI went total hog wild and blew my diet when I saw French Toast listed as a dessert. It was house made brioche, maple meringue with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. WOW! You've heard of a foodgasm? This dessert will give you multiple ones. \n\nStaff is incredibly knowledgeable of the menu. When each of my dishes were served, they'd explain what it was and how it was prepared. It was like a verbal menu, explaining to you what you had ordered and what you were about to enjoy. \n\nThe only negative I experienced, is that they did not keep up with my alcohol needs. Which I guess could be a good thing. I wasn't over drinking, I only had the Old Fashioned and a glass of wine. However, an after dinner liquor with my sensational French Toast Dessert would have made for an incredible finale. \n\nWhen: August 13, 2016\nWhy: Dinner & STL 100 List",

  "text": "Wow - I coulda sworn i reviewed Susanna Foo a looooong time ago, but I guess not.  Anyhow - went there again (3rd time) last night and sat putside - which I usually never do.  It was a surprising lovely evening.  I had been here twice before for lunch - which was good but maybe only 3 or 4 stars.  \n\nLast nite's meal solidified the 4 stars.  Service was wonderful and attentive (maybe because they are slow in the summer??).  We stated with virgin Golden Pineapple Mojitos which were truly delish.  FRESH pineapple juice and mint - perfectly balanced.\n\nMy dining companion was a close friend from out of town who walked by and wanted to go here.  She is very health conscious and ordered the salmon in a light (not too salty) black bean sauce over a crsip tender bed of TERRIFIC baby bok choi.  It was accompanied by a Cocunt \"polenta\" that was so silken it tased and felt like coconut flan.  Almost dessert like.\n\nI had a started of an Ahi Tuna Sampler (which I have ordered before and I just love it.).  At $17 it is small and expensive - but the quality of the tuna tartare and the fabulous accompaniments make it somehow worth every delicious teeny morsel.\n\nInstead of an entree I had the COMPOSED  $12 salad with golden beets, candied Walnuts, sliced yellow tomatoes, microgreens in a delectable, sweet but not cloying , light vinagrette.  The salad came with 5 small goat-cheese wontons - that looked like over-stuffed tortellni.\n\nI ate 3 and gave 2 to my partner.  They really didn't do much for me.  The goat cheese inside was almost like a bleu?  Goat gorgonzola maybe?  Too strong.\n\nBut the salad and all the other compnents was terrific.\n\nIf you think Foo is past her prime or somehow not \"all that\" anymore - I urge you to give it another try.  At dinner.  (It was way better than the 2 lunches I had previously.)",

The escargot, burgundy style were cooked to perfection with shallots, garlic, butter, herbs and finished off with a good red wine, so yummy and I lapped up every drop of the sauce with the grilled crustini!\n\nThe mushroom bisque was to die for, I haven't had such a wonderful mushroom bisque since dining at the Terrace Restaurant at Longwood Gardens! In fact, I will go so far as to say this was quite memorable and probably the best I will ever have. How they were able to chop those mushrooms into the size of a speck, I will never know. The bisque was so very flavorful and topped with crème fraiche, truffles and white truffle oil. Remarkable indeed!\n\nListen to this! 14 ounces of broiled rare Australian lamb chops, that melted in my mouth with each bite. They were served as two triple cut chops and I was humming while I was gathering each tender morsel of these flavorful chops. The chops were huge, so meaty and not one bit of fat, so much better than the fingernail sized Colorado lamb chops, so much better that I did not even offer hubby a bite.\n\nSpeaking of hubby, he did share in some of my escargot and mushroom bisque, surprisingly, as he will normally eat neither and really did enjoy both.\n\nMichael then had the wedge and I really appreciated how they served it, all was on one long rectangular plate, with the wedge in the center, red onions in one corner, diced ripe tomatoes in another, sliced boiled eggs, and a side of bleu cheese dressing, heavily loaded with bleu cheese crumbles. \n\nHe also had an 18 ounce porterhouse, which he ordered rare and devoured it, saying that it was not the best he has ever had, but he enjoyed it.\n\nWith our entrees you have a choice of baked potato, truffled mashed, stuffed baked potato, sea salted shoestring potatoes or sticky rice. I chose the frites and hubby had the loaded baked potato, both were very good. They also have plenty of premium sides that you can order.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxing, beautiful decor, the servers all work together and this time I left quite impressed. The prices were surprising low compared to other upscale steak houses. Once again, we had Joseph as our server, he's not as shy as he was in the beginning.",
