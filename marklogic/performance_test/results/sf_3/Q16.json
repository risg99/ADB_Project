  "text": "I was very excited for this place to open. I live down the street and mexican food is my favorite. There's not a lot of places within walking distance to even go eat at besides the usual pizza and sandwiches. However, I was a little disappointed. I'm a vegetarian so my opinion is a little bias, but the food was very average. You walk in and order on touch screens. They really need a \"build your own option\". The vegetarian options were very limited. I did however like that the veg options were pretty healthy. I went with the veg bowl which was average - filling because of the egg and quinoa but nothing special with the taste. Kinda salty too. We waited a long time for our food (considering it's supposed to \"fast\"). They didn't offer any hot sauce or anything to fill up on the side - instead they had ketchup and mustard which is just so strange for a taco place. There's additional seating upstairs, but it kind of smells like a bathroom up there. The wait staff was very friendly. \n\nI don't see myself trying this place again, it was nothing extraordinary at all.",

After waiting a while they sent security up to inspect the room then sent us to the front desk. No apologies; however they offered to move us to a room on the same floor. No thank you...they then offered a room on a much lower floor. Definitely not happy with the service received. We love this resort for the spa, this is our first time staying at the hotel. Will not stay here again.",

This review will focus on the convenient store aspect as opposed to the refueling services on offer.\n\nNo coconut water, but lots of sugary options for beverages, which was disheartening. They had the Advil I was in search of. GF couldn't open packaging, obviously not Valero's fault, but still, I won't let that fact spoil this review. \n\nI can see how some of the other reviewers claims of unfriendly employees came to be. Part of me also thinks they're just a touch too taciturn, but not gonna hate on that. To them I say \"mahalo\". \n\nMay refuel here later on today, if so, will report back.",

It is a dressed up diner. \n\nThe inside decor and atmosphere is swanky and fun but the food and menu were disappointing. \n\nVery few options to choose from in general. To make it even worse, there were very few vegetarian options. You may be asking why did we go here then but their menu option on yelp wasn't working so we went here on a whim/recommendation. #Regrets\n\nOrdered the hummus and pita which was so so. Nothing to write home about. \n\nMy friend got the ALT which was also eh and I got the Greek salad which was depressing to say the least. \n\nAll in all, I think this diner needs more than just a face lift but an actual redesign of the menu concept.",

After that the night was utterly disappointing. Grossly understaffed which resulted in horrific service. Warm beer. The chopped salad bordered on flavorless and greasy burgers were mismatched, in attempt to be cool, messily presented on cheese boards. Bathrooms need signage. And while two people appeared to cover the entire restaurant. The other two staff members just needed coffee in their hands while they chatted in the conceptually interesting pastry bar.

  "text": "The only reason why the rating isn't lower is that dinner (in person) at Tre Lune can be a really nice experience. The service and food quality can be top notch.\n\nOrdering take out is another experience altogether.\n\nSure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a Montecito restaurant but we didn't realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food quality/consistency. After all isn't food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over?\n\nThe latest takeout experience involved ordering Garganelli with chicken and mushrooms. One order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought - on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg. We have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal (being facetious of course) but there doesn't appear to be a way to post those while writing this review. Keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in.  The same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added.\n\nOur advice - don't order takeout at Tre Lune.  If you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu, then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way.\n\nPS. And no, these are not the only examples.  There are others but clearly we didn't learn our lesson and continued ordering.  The last experience may have sealed the deal for a long while.",

And the ones they processed have all been denied for various reasons, mostly that documents are missing.\n\nThis reason is even given after the doctors office sent all the documents to the insurance groups head office and I have gotten a confirmation of the receipt of those documents.\n\nDon't expect this company to be there for you! You're just wasting your money.\n\nI even talked on the phone to their costumer service while being in the hospital for further examinations and it took them about a week after that to approve a pre-certification for X-Ray/MRT. 1 week!!!\n\nLuckily my injury wasn't as time sensitive as some can be because it would be critical with their speed of working to get help (most hospitals and doctors only treat after approval for coverage from the insurance company).\n\nAnd after you got your treatments this company will try EVERYTHING to postpone your claims and on top deny them so they don't have to cover for them.\n\nAfter my experience with them I'm 100% sure that all positive feedback for this company is fake. I should have read the ones here before signing with them. Being from Europe I have never experienced an insurance company working like them. This is like from a bad movie where in the end the patients have to sue the insurance company to get to their right.\n\nDon't even think about getting coverage here, because even if you pay for one you will not be covered or denied coverage for any fake reason they can find.\n\nI can already see my claims going to a lawyer and luckily i have proof for everything (from coverage to non-pre-existing conditions). It will still be a headache and not what anybody should deal with.\n\nNot an insurance company to trust!",

None of the Jerky is made in-house, instead this is a chain operated by a sole proprietor. It was a great idea for him to open this place bc it attracts tourists like a magnet, but being a local I think my first time shopping there will be my last. Bought the Turkey jerky in Teriyaki and Pepper flavor and I have to say even the bagged Jerky from the grocery store tastes way better. The Sales guy was kind of meh, but I wouldn't say he was rude or aloof, just not overtly friendly. To each their own, but I think they're trying to push a mass produced jerky that only appears to be homemade. Overall, kind of a tourist trap.",

Here's the kicker, they charge $1.50 for fried onions! Are you friggin' kidding me? We also added green peppers and mushrooms to ours for another $6.00....wow. So, now the 12\" cheese steak goes from $10.99 to $15.45. That is rediculous. Like I said, my husband ran out to grab dinner, if I was there, I would have walked out. I understand an additional charge for mushrooms, even peppers...but fried onions? And at $1.50 per add on, the sandwich should have been loaded...but I had to search for the onions and peppers...I did spot the mushrooms...but I would no way say it justified an additional $4.50 on a 12\" cheese steak. In all fairness, the cheese steak was good, but if I'm paying $4.50 to add fried onions, peppers and mushrooms, I shouldn't have to search through the sandwich for them. I'd say the peppers and onions were between diced and minced in size. Will definitely NOT be ordering here again. Just a heads up too, although the fries at $3.99 didn't seem a bad deal...they sealed them in a round foil pan with a lid..so they were  damp with no crunch at all.",

  "text": "We have had many problems with Express Scripts in the past.  They take at least 3 to 4 weeks to send out a prescription, so we are always in the position of paying ridiculously expensive expedited shipment charges.  Furthermore, I have NEVER received my sleeping pill from them even though they say they have mailed it.  I believe someone within Express Scripts steals controlled substances.\n\nOur latest debacle with this company is that they told us we could no longer fill our prescriptions at Kroger, that Kroger was no longer in our plan.  I contacted our company and this is not true.  I called Express Scripts again and spoke with a different customer service rep who said that Kroger is in our plan, but if we use them instead of using Walgreen's or Express Scripts, we will incur a severe penalty.\n\nI insisted on speaking with a supervisor.  I told the supervisor I wanted a cost analysis of the cost to us of filling our prescriptions as Kroger versus Walgreen's.  I already knew that every one of our prescriptions is cheaper at Kroger than at Walgreen's.  At that point, the supervisor acquiesced and admitted that we could use Kroger without any penalty.  \n\nObviously, Express Scripts makes a greater profit if the customer uses Walgreen's or Express Scripts instead of Kroger.  The supervisor denied that his underlings were told to try to make customers use the retail outlets that are more profitable to Express Scripts, but I don't believe it.  I told him the problem is one of the following:  1) Employees are told to shift customers to retail outlets that are more profitable for Express Scripts, which is dishonest; or 2) The employees of Express Scripts are very poorly trained and don't understand the prescription policies they enforce.  Either explanation is a bad reflection on Express Scripts.  \n\nThis is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with.  If you must deal with them, insist on speaking with supervisors only.",

The chorizo was dry, the eggs tasted like a mix, and the cheese wasn't even melted.

Guy at the front desk was rude and got snippy when I was confused as why my boyfriend couldn't use his card for the pet fee. They charge tax on a pet fee. Also it's a fee not a deposit as I was told it would be. They also refused to put us on the first floor like we had requested months ago.

Their employees are always too high to function, they have a hard time remembering orders and constantly leave things either at the store or in their car. I ordered from Hungry Howie's on Pantano last night, it literally took an hour for the food to get here and then he forgot the drinks and the garlic sauce. He had to go back to the store to get it which literally took about 15 to 20 minutes so by the time our drinks got here we were already done eating. And another thing, do not use their split technique online, I split my payment between my debit card and cash and it put it all on my debit card. The delivery driver didn't even have me sign the receipt so I didn't realize that it was paid in full until I looked at my receipt. I literally complained about the service and this delivery driver thought that I gave him a $13 tip, didn't even say anything. I go in today to get my $10 back, because I only meant for him to have a $3 tip because his service sucked, and they're only excuse was, I'm sorry he's new. So you don't train your new guys to have the customers sign the receipt when they use a card? Because if he had, this whole ordeal would have been avoided.

This was far more than minor PDA, it was almost vulgar in a soft-porn type of style. We parked and as we got ready to go in one of the girls was walking in the door. Although I can't be 100% certain, I do assume she works there....she was carrying a server apron and other items in with her. When we tried to call and inform the management, we were lead in a circle of automation that never allowed us to talk to an actual person.

I'm not one for hyperbole but I can say this was the worst crawfish I've ever had in New Orleans. Tasted like it was boiled in just plain water. I didn't have a scale handy but I've eaten enough crawfish to know what four pounds looks like and this didn't look like it to me. They were mostly no bigger than my index finger and carefully arranged so that no plate was showing but with that amount there should be a mound and there was no mound. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on size because I came pretty late in the day, but there's just no excuse for skimping on volume or a bland crawfish. It's a shame because I had scoped out the menu before and had wanted to try a lot of it but I'm reluctant now if they can't do a crawfish proper.",

However, once you get inside your car, after you have already paid over $20 for the car wash plus tip, I found that they didn't even wipe down my doors, or seats. The reason for the wash was because I had left my windows open so there was a layer of pollen on my seats and doors, hence the reason i spent over $20 for a car wash. I called to make the manger aware that i was disappointed in my car was and he stated that it is not there job to wipe down the door or seats, and he was not interested in what I had to say. I am still confused as to what they do other than wash the outside and vacuum the inside then? \nI decided to give them another shot over the weekend, and i was just as disappointed as the first time i took my car.

They assured us it would be here shortly. \n\nMy food arrived about 20 minutes later and we began to pass it out. I ordered three total bagels and a egg, chorizo  and cheese sandwich. One bagel was charred burnt and the sandwich was just regular sausage patties. \n\nMy husband called back to let them know how disappointed we were for ordering food from their site instead of grub hub as they suggested. The owner told us that because they were busy inside, their website ordering was pushed back. \n\nHe then explained that our food was incorrect and she told him he was lying. Why would a grown person call an establishment that they tend to frequent to lie about their service? She kept talking over my husband and telling him that we were incorrect for ordering our food the way it was ordered. Are you kidding me?

HOWEVER, we went last night to celebrate my brothers graduation and ALL of our seafood dishes had rotten shrimp in them. My brother is not very food conscious but even he pointed out that the shrimp had a bad taste. My mom and I tasted the shrimp from all the seafood dishes and had to spit it out. She told the waiter and sent back a few pieces for the chef to try, only for the waiter to come out and say that the chef didn't taste anything wrong with it and the best he could do was take 20% off our bill. We weren't looking to get any discounts, we were simply trying to make the staff aware of the rotten shrimp. My mom was mostly concerned about the chef's judgement. She has been in the restaurant industry for decades and was appalled when the chef said he didn't taste what was wrong. Those of us with seafood lost our appetite and left with our plates still full of food. Money and time wasted. Not sure if we will be returning, such a shame considering this was a staple restaurant for us :(",

  "text": "This place has a very quiet, local feel to it, despite being flooded with tourists. We came on a Friday afternoon before St. Patrick's Day, and was it packed outside. There was a group of maybe 10 waiting and other groups of 2-4 waiting on the street. The hostess was very polite and helpful, but we ended up waiting close to 1.5-2 hours for a table of 3. \n\nThe decor of the place gives the similar vibe when you arrive - it feels very homey and welcome. The staff was a bit slower with service and not too attentivie to me patiently waiting to put our order down or get the check - understandable since it's so busy, but can still be improved. I had the crab meat omelette and it was alright at best, but not worth the wait or the price. My friend liked his bananas foster french toast, so possibly I should have ordered the other recommended items.\n\nWhat really made this experince a 2 star as opposed to a 3 star was the staff messed up our check. We waited 10 minutes to finally get their attention to send the check over, only to have the bill twice the actual price. I'm pretty certain the check was meant for the table of 5 next to us, so I'm sure they were happy getting a $35 bill. There wasn't really a sense of urgency in getting the check out of the way, which might have explained the extremely long wait to get into the restaurant. \n\nMaybe we came on a bad day, maybe I ordered the wrong item, and maybe the waiter was new. Either way, I wouldn't recommend this place despite the high reviews. Unless there's no wait, you will probably have a better experience elsewhere.",

The moron who packaged the unit enclosed the wrong power supply which would have damaged the unit. I am unable to plug it in to verify. The Rocktron Gainiac requires a 9 volt AC power supply with a minimum of 1.5 amp current. The dumb@$$ sent me a 9 volt DC power supply rated at 150 milliwatts. This power supply would more than likely damage the unit. I am unable to verify because I am intelligent enough not to use the wrong value power supply. In good faith, I paid for a working quality effects unit and I cannot even use it. This kind of incompetence really pisses me off. This makes me wonder if Guitar Center hires morons.

Frosty Boy have decent soft serve ice cream in vanilla and chocolate flavors. They do have a weekly special flavor as well so keep your eyes out for those! I was disappointed that they do not offer sprinkles, only dipped or crunch toppings. An ice cream shop without sprinkles! What?! I was shocked when the cashier told me this.

  "text": "I don't even know where to begin aside from if I was able to give 0 stars I would. I wish I had read yelp reviews before wasting 2 hrs of my Friday night. We went there after my daughter's preschool graduation this past Friday since it was close to her school. Walking in it was a nice atmosphere, that's all I can say nice about this restaurant. Starting off it took 15 minutes to even order drinks. I ordered sprite for my daughter and asked for lemonade for my son.  They said they were out of lemonade but had Hawaiian Punch, I turned down the punch because of the high sugar content and opted for water which I'm certain came straight from the faucet. They came back with punch anyways stating the sprite was out.  We ordered the garlic bread since they were out of two other appetizers we wanted. They brought them out uncut and gave me a steak knife to cut myself. One was so burnt I'm confident they wrapped it in foil and put it in the microwave to catch on fire.  I sent that back and said to just take it off our bill. My husband and I both ordered the pasta with shrimp and garlic cream sauce. When it came out it was a big lump of extremely gummy mush that I wouldn't eat if it was 6 months in to the zombie apocalypse. The sauce was straight from a can and the top was covered in shrimp that wasn't even big enough to consider salad shrimp, all cold. I couldn't even order another meal as they were out of everything! My children had spaghetti, again cold and from a can. My nephew ordered a calzone,  then informed us they were out so he got pizza. Again,not cut they brought a pizza cutter for us to do ourselves.  There is so much more, but this alone was worth warning others. I am not even sure they have a working kitchen aside from a microwave, not to mention all the food is bought at a local grocery store I'm assuming frozen.Obviously I have no desire to go back. I am baffled they have stayed in business this long. It's so unorganized it's actually very sad. 76$ later even with items removed I had fruit loops for dinner..",

His face basically said \"I don't want to be here.\" Then, I was met my a Physician Assistant, not even a Medical Doctor. She was quickly checked me and told me to get a EKG and CXR (chest x-ray). She said she would call me back for the result later since they do not have a radiologist to read the result at the moment. I was fine with that since I understand how this procedure works. Now, 2 weeks after, I still have not receive any calls from them about the chest x-ray result. I messaged them via the online portal and they haven't even read it. The EKG result also could not be read by the PA neither so she once again directed me to see another cardiologist. How ridiculous the experience was! I went to other urgent clinics before but none of them was as bad as this one. Just don't go here. Go to MedExpress or Centra Care, at least they will give you a diagnosis or something.",

I think they're used to feeding tourists who don't know better. The quality and quantity of their food was less than mediocre. We started with the charbroiled oysters which were tiny and dry. They were served with some hard, stale French bread. Then, I had the seafood salad which was supposed to be shrimp and lump crabmeat on a bed of mixed greens. It amounted to $18 for 5 boiled shrimp on a huge bed of old iceberg lettuce - the kind with brown edges, and the   crabmeat was definitely not fresh. Even the tomatoes were past ripe and inedible. I had one of their hush puppies from my friend's plate, and it was cold and stale. (Take a lesson from Zea's. Theirs are amazing!) My husband had the shrimp pasta and his had only 5 shrimp as well.  So, unless they improve their offerings, count me out. Too bad because the waiters were working hard and the location in the water is lovely.",

  "text": "Update. Today we really wanted to come and enjoy ourselves here. Service from our waitress was awful. She didn't ask if we wanted refills on our soft drink or our 2 for 1 drinks. She looked super out of place. Like she didn't know what she was doing. Never asked how we were. Waited an our for our food to come out. Then when our waitress brought our ticket to pay, she charged us for an extra drink and upcharged a meal. I had to let her know that it needed to be changed. Her response was, \" oh. Ok I guess I'll go change it for you.\" It was 2 for 1 so it shouldn't have been a double charge. She made our morning brunch a bad experience. Even though we frequent ML Rose, we will probably not come back to this location if we were to get her again. Other than that the food was good.",

  "text": "I'm genuinely bummed with the lunch we got today. First, let me say that my boyfriend and I have eaten at some sketchy, hole in the wall places before including food carts in other countries. Appearance isn't always everything even when it comes to the flavor of food. But this was a really unexpectedly bad experience and I really can't believe the number of positive reviews. I've always joked and said there's no way to mess up nachos. Well today I stand corrected. Our nachos were bizarre... imagine rock hard chips covered in verde sauce with luke-warm half melted cheese and mysterious gray-colored refried beans. Not good at all but we picked through the plate anyway. I would have taken a picture to give an idea of how bad they were but I was still trying to remain optimistic for our main dishes. I ordered the shrimp tacos on corn tortillas and my boyfriend ordered three different tacos. His looked good and he was content with them. I was stoked to eat mine until I realized almost every shrimp was under cooked. Like fleshy, mushy, not-even-pink undercooked. If anyone has ever experienced the effects of eating poorly prepared food before (me) this immediately triggers flashbacks to dying in the bathroom.  So sadly, I had to pick through each taco barely eating any of it. We didn't have enough attentive service to bring it to the kitchens attention and honestly at that point I had just given up. So, while my boyfriend's food wasn't horrible, I walked away hungry and bummed. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but undercooking shrimp significantly is unacceptable. I don't plan to ever go back again.",

They used to be so moist and full of cinnamon goodness. Now the outside of the rolls are so hard you could break a window with them, have hardly any icing on the top and the inside doesn't have the beautiful swirl of cinnamon. It's almost like the cinnamon rolls were made without butter or the cinnamon/sugar mixture. My other favorite here used to be the pumpkin crumb muffins.

The service on the weekday was much better, as the restaurant wasn't 25% full. Both times the buffet was heavy on chicken dishes and sadly one dish tasted very much like the other. They weren't bad, just nothing that stood out. On the first visit the paneer was dry and firm, but was soft and much better on the second visit. The cashier being in the corner and surrounded by tables was very awkward while checking out during the busy weekend. Not sure I'll be back.",

I called ahead to make sure that they could get me in because it was kind of late in the day and didn't want to get rushed through and they told me to come on in. I got there and go my pedicure and the lady that did the pedicure was awesome. She did fantastic!!!! She didn't rush through until the guy came over that was doing my nails and started working on my nails. And i couldn't understand what was said but seemed like he rushed her to get done. So after my pedi cure he had me come sit in his chair and completely rushed through my nails so instead of complaining then because it was about to close i waiting until today to go back and TRRRRY to have them fixed. I got there and all he did was file them down. Didn't even reapply the polish and just said ok better, and i said well i guess I'm just going to go somewhere else. And on top of everything i spend $70 and also tipped them $10. So $80 later I'm in tears and headed somewhere else to get them fixed!! I'm beyond upset and wouldn't recommend going here. So on top of everything i went to a new place and spent $30 more to get my nails fixed so $110 on a gel nail and a regular pedicure!! Ridiculous!!!!!",

  "text": "We have always loved the banh mi sandwiches here but our experience this weekend was disappointing. I got a noodle salad with shrimp, spicy pork and an egg roll. The pork lacked that char grilled flavor. The egg roll (which contained ground shrimp and pork) had a funny smell and tasted off. When my husband tasted it he said the meat was bad and not to eat it. We told the server and he brought out Lilly who insisted the egg rolls are made fresh daily and it was the taro root in it that tasted that way. We didn't say anything else but my husband, who is Vietnamese and owns his own restaurant said it was not the taste of taro because it's something he eats. He knows the smell of bad meat. I'm disappointed she did not at least offer to take the uneaten egg roll off our bill or replace it. \nNot surprisingly I got sick that afternoon from that one bite of egg roll and was in the bathroom and felt awful the rest of the day. I typically have a cast iron stomach but not this time.  I don't think I'll be eating egg rolls again there.",

  "text": "So utterly upset with this place. Never before has an establishment aggravated me so. It is a 90 minute wait to get in. They said we will call you when table ready. We got in after 1 hr wait. During that hour we sat in a hot entry way with a squeaky door..no air condition with weather in hot humid 90s. After 45 mins, I ordered coffee from walk up bar.  They got it wrong..has to wait to remake. There was water pooled up in front of coffee station..no one was mopping it. Finally get seated outside counter. We gave order right away because we wanted to check in at our hotel and enjoy some pool time.  We waited, waited, waited..after 1 hour we asked for manager...They finally brought food like 1p min later. The manager was nice, took 25% off..gave us coupons for next time but we won't be back. Our server gave us tude when she brought bill and upon our leaving. I normally do not complain but although the food is supposed to be part of Nashville's finest, the management here is severely lacking to keep up with demand. Tgey also should afford air condition. We finally got to our hotel pool at our $400 a night hotel at 3p because of this place. Thanks Milk & Honey for ruining a huge part of our Nashville vacation.",

  "text": "I've never thought Fulin's was that bad...until today.   \nThe menu's are DISGUSTINGLY sticky and in need of wiping down.   The window by table looks like two year olds rubbed their dirty hands all over it.   Our waitress attire looks like she never washes it...by the way she's served us before with dirty clothing so it's her mojo.  The first two sushi's were okay but something seemed to be lacking in taste and the presentation was... nothing...usually sushi is presented quite beautifully.  \nBut we ate it and wondered if we were ruined since we had sushi at a new place in Murfreesboro that was over the TOP delicious and fresh.   So we went on and ordered a third sushi.   The waitress served us the third sushi with the oddest hesitation...the sushi looked awful.  The menu never said the seaweed paper was on the outside.  It said it was served with avocado and one tiny piece of avocado was on ONE slice.  It was suppose to have Roe and it was nowhere to be found.  So we got the menu and proceeded to complain to the waitress as we felt it wasn't clearly explained what we were getting.  I honestly now wonder if the other two sushi's were even prepared correctly.   I had tasted one bite of the scallops sprinkled over the top and it was sooooooo dried out and disgusting.   My husband tried a slice of the roll.  He doesn't like seaweed on the outside to begin with but he said he's had better at the grocery stores (which is usually very bad).  So that's how low this place has gone.   Fulin's need a serious makeover and management that wants to serve good food.   You've lost two customers.",

My boyfriend went in to pick up the order 20 minutes after we called and we waited an additional hour and 20 minutes longer. I ended up following after him after he told me he was getting upset and exchanged words with someone who worked there. When I entered I asked him if anyone apologized for the wait, if anyone offered a discount due to the inconvenience (they asked him for the money as soon as he walked in to get the food...we would've left if that wasn't the case) or if they offered anything else with our order .... he said no which made me upset. There were other people waiting for food for an hour+ as well. Someone came in who worked for the company and heard me speaking about the issue with my boyfriend... still no apology. We got our food which was cold and the rice was white to be considered as \"fried\", chicken was thrown on top as well. My mom said it was bland. Our pasta was dry, Little to no sauce. An apology would've been a start to fix this issue but one wasn't given. This was his first time eating from Tasties ... he said he never wants to eat from there again. It's really the small things that keep customers coming back. Unfortunately, nobody working at Tasties did any of those things today and lost customers .",

As a female, the staff hits on you and only assists you if you flirt with them. Been here a few times because it's open late, while hoping each experience would get better. Nope I was wrong! Disappointed for the LAST time!",

I tried this place because it was close to home; first time fill here. I would stick to the local breweries to fill, it is MUCH cheaper. Catalina brewery is $16, the barrio is $12, tap & bottle ranges around $18. Bartender was friendly enough,  but I won't be back to fill, which is unfortunate because it is called Growler and close to home. Bummer.",

The food was overpriced and not good. The wine was warm. The table was dirty. The view was okay, I watched people at the bar across the street having fun and wished I was there instead. The worst part? The stench of rotten trash blowing up from the street to the table. Is this a \"thing\" in Nashville or were the garbage collectors on strike? Every dumpster was overflowing.

First our waiter was awful, he did not check on us for probably 20 minutes. The bartender served us our appetizers and we had no silverware. After stopping another waiter to find ours for silverware, he went and told our waiter and he still waited 10 minutes to come. When he finally did, he refilled drinks and left for another 20 minutes without bringing us utensils. We eventually took them off a different table when our food was served to us and then he came and said he forgot. 2 people in our party ordered drinks from the bar that were awful, it was as if they didn't have a drop of liquor. The food was just plain bad. The pork steaks were like chewing rubber, the sides were flavorless. We were shocked after we started eating. The only food that was okay was the kids Mac n cheese and the BBQ nachos. Don't waste your money, you'll end up leaving frustrated that you paid so much for horrible service and gross food.",

Seriously karma??? How is this even called a bowl when you barely get a taste of granola. They're so money hungry I guess. This is unacceptable!!!!! I will NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!",

The bowl was so disappointing and didn't look a thing like what they advertise. Not to mention the price of the bowl for what I got. Portions where much smaller and the salmon had a strange taste to it. It was drenched in soy sauce so much so that I had to pour some out to make it edible. Green bubble tea tastes chalky. After reading more reviews I hope I don't get sick tonight. I won't try a second time.",

The last time I was in I was there on a  Thursday, so I decided I would try a different day. I stopped in on Monday, forgetting that it was a holiday. ( That should not matter.) I knew I was in trouble when I pulled up and saw both managers / supervisors sitting in the detail shop. ( I assume they were managers as they had red shirts.) There should be no surprise here, as that is where they were the last time I was here. I decided to stick it out and see what happened. I would have to say the job was worse than last time. There was no sense of urgency to get my vehicle done, and the wipe down was very sloppy and incomplete, both inside and out. I could not communicate with the employees working on my vehicle. They did not seem to care. They seemed more interested in goofing off. Maybe a supervisor that actually was working would make a difference. But I guess loafing is more of a priority. This is a very unprofessional outfit. Your money would be better spent elsewhere. I am done with them.\n\nGail Gloria",

There was a buffet and she didn't explain that I couldn't get my side from the buffet, therefore she charged me for \"smothered potatoes\" which were not and she still brought the side of smothered potatoes from the same place I got mine from!

But my major issue with the place Is that while watching my burger being cooked the cook took a small break to eat some of her burger that was laying out in the prep area ( if I had to guess that's a reason for not posting the health score) to her credit she did remove her glove to eat and then put it back on when returning to cook my food\nUpon receiving my burger it came without the bacon, but the cook very apologetic quickly fixed the mistake \n\n\nThe food isn't bad at all, it's not great, but it's not bad. \n\nThis could be a great place if properly managed!!!\n\nI will return for another meal as I frequent the movie theatre next door \n\nA possible helping hint, don't advertise that all you're ingredients are the freshest, when they are very obviously frozen and canned, but still tasty",

  "text": "Not quite good, but not quite bad. This place fills a niche for tacos and burritos, but they're not very consistent. But they've only been open for a week, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Things are usually either too salty, too bland, or too spicy. Not a bit fan. If you want a novel on why, read on, or else stop right here and move on.\n\nI have personally never been to their Fishtown location, but according to the staff, this place has a more expended menu. The location recently opened up (last week as of the intial posting of this review) from the remains if a Chinese takeout place. There's two floors. The ordering area is on the first floor, additional seating is on the second floor, along with the restrooms. The entrance way is a bit narrow and the lower level can be a bit cold on wintery days as the doors can get open by the breeze of patrons opening the front door to go in and out. Second floor seating is recommended for those looking to eat in. The logo is apparently based off of Boss Tweed, if you are wondering. \n\nI went a few times before their official opening week (this week). I've tried their burritos, tacos, platter, and chili. Overall the taste is flavorful, not too rich (or salty). Your order is freshly prepared, so its nice and hot, if it doesn't end up sitting in the counter for a while. The overall quality varies. I've had the fish burrito and the beef tacos with hard-shell tortillas (very rare to have in most taco places in  the area). Sometimes the meat comes out all greasy. This affects the overall taste and is a bit of a turn off for some people, like me. The tortillas shells were also stale on the taco I got and the toppings were missing as well. I usually eat in, but this time I got tacos for take out, so I didn't realize until I got back of the problem. Needless to say, for a pair of tacos at $7, I was pretty disappointed.\n\nI gave them another chance on their official opening week and tried their whitefish platter. At $11, it was a bit underwhelming. The platter came with two decently-sized pieces of freshly fried fish, on a bed of house-made rice, with roasted corn on the cobb, slathered with their special sauce. It tasted good and fresh overall, the fish lacked seasoning, but it's how I like it. Not to salty and not too rich (or greasy this time). The portions were sized well, but I feel that the kernel should have been portioned off the cobb, for easier eating.\n\nThis place has a chili as well. Its $5 for a cup, but it's more like a dry stew than a chili. Despite its name it very thick and dry, there seemed to be big chunks beef and there along with beans so its very hearty. It's not as soupy as you would expect from most places. The taste overall was a bit saltier and richer than I like it. The seasoning wasn't too strong, but the spiciness was on the low-end. Barely any kick, so it might disappoint those that looking for a bit of an edge.\n\nOne more try with the Tijuana Poutine. It was salty. Not just regular salty, but I-should-find-something-to-wash-my-mouth-out kind of salty. Not due to the fries or the pickled jalapeños. What was the cause you ask? It was the Macho Chili (it wasn't as salty the last time I tried it). If you get this starter, a drink is HIGHLY recommended. The saltiness wraps around your mouth so much that you can't even taste the rest of the stuff. The egg doesn't add to it at all, it feels more like a decoration than anything. The portion was big, but very disappointing. \n\nTheir \"Mexican Soup\" or rather Minestrone Soup with Chorizo was overly spicy. While I can handle some spice, the amount of spiciness was overpowering and detracted from the taste of the soup. It's a spiciness that creeps up on you the more you eat it. It detract from the overall taste as the more you eat the less you'll be able to taste the soup. Soda or juice is not a recommended compliment to the soup as it ruin the balance, like if you tried to wash out the bitter taste of straight up spoon of tabasco with Coke or Sprite. This side is not a good paring with any dish or as a standalone. Milk Bubble Tea from iTea will help you wash the taste out, if the spice is too much for you.\n\nService overall is friendly, but the quality can be inconsistent, especially around the lunch rush. The taste varies wildly to the point that I question what the all those chefs in the kitchen are doing. The lead chef should at least taste a portion of what comes out. \n\nThose looking for good \"Mexican\" fare might be disappointed, but if you're looking for a somewhat healthy freshly made meal, and don't mind things things fried, this place is a decent choice. It definitely fills a niche for tacos, burrito, and the like. Worth a try if your hungry and want to try something different. It's certainly different from your typical taco/burrito place. I want to like this place, but I can't. There's not much consistency at all between menu items.",

He came out because my food was terrible.  They actually did not fully cook the macaroni noodles and they were literally crunchy.  They actually heard me complaining about it, which I did merely because my wife asked why I wasn't eating.  I don't send food back at a restaurant because having worked in the food industry I know better than to anger the cooks.

  "text": "Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different.",

I left in the car my radar detector complete with a case not logged in to their lost and found. When I check in my rental on 12/21 and returned 01/02/2018 to visit the counter they told me nothing was found. They also told me that for something with a case go missing was very unlikely. Yet they found nothing. Hmmm, I wonder how it can go missing when it was the only place I left it? I filed a lost ticket with them; Reference Number: 4355421, Reported: 12/21/2017.\n\nThey may think their employees may be honest but my $300 radar detector is nowhere to be found at their location. So? Yes, one of their employee's stole it. \n\nI'm a fan of the concept of picking your car. As someone who has been using the same rental place in St. Louis Airport for 8 months and counting. I can tell you they do lousy job at cleaning the cars. I'm always finding plastic bottles underneath the back seats.\n\nI'm also finding a lot un-wiped of front seat and dashboard areas full of sticky substances. The cars are never fully clean as someone who rents from them weekly.\n\nThis location does a shitty job of making cars ready for travel. As someone who has access to the execute cars due to the amount of travel I do. They fail to meet some simple travel requirements you expect when you rent. \n\nNext time you rent look underneath the seats in the passenger areas and you may find plastic bottle under them.\n\nI would love for them to review the cameras and see who cleaned the car so they can fire them on the day I returned the rental! I brought them thousand of dollars and I do expect a refund for the stolen item.",

But the experience was terrible from start to finish and I'll have to post \"buyer beware.\" I almost don't know where to begin...but let's start with the extraordinarily long line-it's Essence Fest so I get it, lines are everywhere.   But we were 7th on the wait list and waited over 2 hours.  We watch while \"celebrities-not\" breezed in from off the streets to be seated in front of myself and other paying customers who also had been waiting for HOURS for what would be a mediocre meal.  \n\nWe were told that the \"owner was hosting them at his private table.\"  Problem is the place has 20 tables and a bar so if the owner wanted to pay for or host \"celebrities\"  -he/she should've closed for the day.  It's called, \"closed for a private event.\" It felt exclusionary and demoralizing.  What happened to valued customer service?\n\nAnd then I get inside and order and wait, and wait, and wait another hour before food finally arrives.  My sweet potato pancakes were dense-not moist or fluffy and my spinach and feta omelette was unseasoned and light on the feta. Everything was warm-not hot, not cold-just warm.  Did someone forget to grab from the window on time for a hot plate to arrive to my table?  It wasn't just me though the salmon, bananas foster, and shrimp and grits that my friends ordered all arrived warm.  The grits are dense and bland and not at all cheesy-really.\n\nOnce half of our order arrived the waitresses disappeared and we were hunting folks down to ask for silverware hot sauce and syrup.  Wait staff seemed uninterested in our polite feedback and dismissive.  \n\nThis is a new restaurant trying to make a good name but it left a bad taste.  I will not recommend and will not be back.  \n\nTwo stars because it was edible.",

  "text": "I normally LOVE Bailey's Range, but tonight was extremely disappointing. Our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four, but as the night went on, we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us. She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",

  "text": "Don't trust Adina to do your wedding hair, she canceled mine 2 weeks before my wedding day... It's taken me a while to write this review but it still bothers me what happened. I booked Adina to do my bridal hair for my wedding about a year and a half ago. Things seemed to be going good, did a couple trials to get the style I wanted, then 2 weeks before my wedding Adina contacts me via Facebook to tell me she double booked and had to cancel my bridal hair. When I responded completely freaking out, she took a long time to respond to me, leaving me in a panic. When she finally responded she said she was trying to find me a replacement stylist. I don't know how you make such a big mistake to double book the most important day of a women's life but to also not realize it until 2 weeks before the big day. There I was 2 weeks before my wedding having to frantically somehow do the nearly impossible of finding a stylist on extremely short notice for wedding day bridal hair. Although I did manage to find someone, we didn't have time to do a trial and although the new stylist did her best, my hair didn't look how I wanted it on my wedding day. Friends and family tell me they think because I only booked her to do my hair and not my entire bridal party, she got an offer to do a bridal party that day and thought of an excuse to cancel mine. I'm sure Adina will deny this accusation which I don't know to be the case or not and honestly I don't care what the reason why, there's no excuse for what she did. Although hair may seem like a minor thing to be concerned with for your wedding in the big scheme of things, we all want to look our best, how we invisioned ourselves on our special day and this was taken away from me because of the irresponsibleness of Adina.",

  "text": "All around poor experience at this particular Bob Evans. This past week, my office decided to have a breakfast meeting at this particular Bob Evans because it was close to our office. Knowing that they opened at 6, we decided to meet here at 6:45. However, when we were arrived, the doors were still locked. The opening shift didn't unlock the doors on time so we were worried that they were closed (even though lights were on). They apologized for the inconvenience, which was nice, and told us to sit anywhere we'd like. For the first hour, we were the only people in the restaurant and only saw our waitress twice. Once to get our water/coffee and secondly to take our orders. It took (about) 30 minutes for our food to be ready. But, once our food was ready, it was sitting on the counter for 15-20 minutes. Because we had been there for an hour and a half, and had to leave to get to work, we had to have our food boxed up for us and eaten at our desks at work instead. Which defeats the purpose of a dining-in experience. Only giving them 2 stars because the banana bread that I ordered was delicious.",

We then received our meal and the jambalaya [which tasted straight out of a box] had hair present. The person receiving the jambalaya is bald so it had to have come from the kitchen. This wasn't surprising as most of the staff spent 80% of their time outside smoking and laughing[with their aprons on].

  "text": "I'm in side the Hardrock standing at the Noodle Bar (food is wonderful). The problem is I am standing , again, with the 6 other people waiting for one of the 16 seats they have for a very, very popular restaurant. Although I'm sure the casino did not expect this place to be so popular, it blows my mind that a company like this has not done anything to rectify this issue. It is equally perplexing that I am standing on probably over 200 sq of tiled floor waiting for a seat. How about putting some tables and chairs in this unutilzed space. Over the past year, I have asked multiple floor managers about this, but hear I am writing this review and still standing waiting for a seat.",

The male bartender was super apathetic and seemingly annoyed by our existence...ex: when taking our brunch order he just walked up and said \"Food?\" In general he couldn't be bothered to interact with us, let alone do it with any hospitality. \n\nLousy drinks --  the mimosas are a ripoff. We ordered a carafe, but it was 90% juice, only the neck was topped off w/ sparkling wine. We're not ordering juice here, people, we're ordering drinks! A mimosa should be mostly sparkling and topped w/ juice. I asked if he could add more but his adjustment made no difference. But here's the kicker -- when a friend of the apathetic bartender sat next to us, she was welcomed with smiles and jovial hospitality, and when she ordered a mimosa guess what she got? 90% sparkling wine, topped with juice! You know, the way they're supposed to be made.\n\nClearly there's no front-of-house manager to oversee and ensure good service.\n\nFood-wise, it's meh. The forgettable $13 & $15 entrees didn't come with sides, so you gotta pay extra to have potatoes or grits or bacon w/ those eggs.\n\nSorry guys, but New Orleans is a food and hospitality town....You aren't even trying. I don't imagine Morrow's will be around unless you step up your game in a major way. (and writing yourself fake reviews wasn't the solution -- glad Yelp removed them!)",

I stopped coming to red lobster... due to the fact you can go to ANY steak & seafood restaurant... and they will charge you the same price for FRESH DELICIOUS FOOD!   This was just sad!!!! Our bill was 110$ for 2 people and it was horrible.    I didn't order broccoli... but the servers had a large birthday party... so I really felt like they just rushed when with us.  I hate broccoli. When she brought out the food which was steak Nd a lobster tail.. she brought out my medium well steak that was cooked all the way thru. It was dry and flavorless.  And the lobster tail was tough, dry and just gross.   I asked her for some ranch , butter; and lemon. So I could drown my food. Considering it was near closing I didn't want to ask for anything to be remade... however they could have offered us something off the bill.    By the time she came back with the sauce I asked for at least 10 mins had passed. My lobster was cold to the touch.  Oh on top of they didn't serve my mash potatoes until 10 mins after my entree. For 10 mins my dry food sat on the table and got cold because it was disgusting and dry!       It was still nasty after I drown it in sauce. All I ate was the rice(that I had to ask for after she brought out the dry old looking broccoli) and the mash potatoes. Which we paid more for lobster Mac but was brought out the smallest portion I've ever seen.    I've ordered it before and never gotten a portion this Small.     I'm also PRETTY POSITIVE Our meal came with a salad. Matter fact I KNOW. Because we've ordered the same thing before. They never even brought us OUR SALAD!      Seriously i will never step foot in this place AGAIN! Ohh and Everytime I come in here either the manager is arguing with employees.

  "text": "As someone from out of town, all I could look forward to was the food. And let me tell you it was a disappointment. I read many good reviews about this establishment. If I could give them no stars I would. Could not run out of there fast enough. Their half peeled shrimp was literal mush. They had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. The shrimp peel was brown, they were probably cooked about a month ago, put in a freezer and served them to me as they thawed. Their jambalaya was further than the truth. It was pasta in tomato sauce with a minuscule piece of chicken. And the fact that I had to pay as I left was bewildering. Not even their mediocre waiters could save, what I would call, the worst dining experience of my life. The only thing that made it worthwhile was when the hostess removed the atrocity that was my dinner and asked \"they nasty?\"",

The Alfred was broken and oily.   The Caesar salad I received with it was just an average caesar nothing to talk about.  The garlic knots were hard. The wings I ordered were over cooked and unseasoned and dry.  My husband ordered a calzone that was soggy and greasy.

The food was fine although when I asked them if they could make it spicy, the answer was no. So that was a bit bizarre, but no worries. What got me is that while we were eating our water was never once refilled and when we asked for the check, it took 47 minutes (I timed it) to arrive. \n\nThe second experience was last night. I decided order via the waitr app and ordered a poke bowl. The app allows you to select ingredients from a menu and add them to a dish. When the food arrived it filled less than half the normal sized container it arrived in. It was also missing half the ingredients I had selected. I have never been so disappointed in a meal in my life. The portion wasn't even enough to feed a child. This is the first time I've felt inclined to leave a poor review and I think it's extremely warranted.",

(We booked 4 rooms) We were looking forward to enjoying family time together in the hotel until Saturday our big event were to take place.  However, that family time included us enjoying the pool that was on premise.  The day we went to go to the pool area we were told by staff that the pool is not available; that it was reserved for a girl's soccer ball team.  I have never EVER heard of such crap like that!  We thought maybe it was just for that day but later on was told that it was not available for the entire 5 days we were booked to stay there.  I'm now thinking \"This is absolutely INSANE!\"  So not having the pool available left us with not much to do but stay inside of those small rooms we rented.  Therefore, we decided to check out earlier then we originally had plan.  This cost us extra money to change our flights but in the long run I feel it was worth it.  Why give \"Element\" anymore of our money.  I tried to check out much earlier but the Marriott Courtyard that was across the street were a bit pricey due to the Memorial Holiday weekend.\n\nFront desk staff at this location needs more professional training when dealing with the public.",

So far, so good until I took a bite. Did someone at KFC change the recipe? I was looking for that Original recipe bite and goodness. What I got was so bland! It is like no one seasoned the chicken! Well I'll be a damn.... And the consistency was like boiled chicken, refried and breaded. Quality control is clearly lacking here. Kudos for the team, MEH for the chicken.

  "text": "Summary: the menu has the word \"curated\" on it. Either you're into this type of place, or you're not. I'm not, but I did pay $7 for an environmental disaster of a dessert, so here's my take. \n\nFirst off, this place is pretty overpriced. $7 for a small cone of soft serve and cubes of cake is hardly a good value. I'm not sure if I'm able to fully judge the desert, I got a curated chocolate flavored cone that was supposed to come with chocolate ice cream, chocolate cake, and chocolate ganache. There was no ganache in or on the cone, which probably would have helped overall. \n\nThe dessert is sold in a cheap, fragile clear plastic cone. I suppose this is for Instagram users, but I would assume most of these people would be concerned about the massive amount of garbage this is creating, for no benefit other than AESTHETIC. This aesthetic would be served better by serving the dessert in a glass reusable container that doesn't crack in your hand under a slight bit of pressure. \n\nThis establishment would do well to invent something portable, cheap and delicious to house the dessert if they don't want to use glass. I'm imagining maybe throwing waffle batter in a really flat griddle, made fresh for the customer, and rolling it into a cone shape while it's still malleable. You could call this thing a \"waffle cone\". If the staff is overwhelmed, maybe the dessert curator could come in and make them while the severs fill them...",

I love heavy and flavorful food as much as the next [sane] person, but the cheese on this sandwich was *caked on* and grease literally ran down my arms and face every time I picked up the sandwich and tried to take a bite of it.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband had fish and chips, but could not eat more than a few bites. We surmised that the fish had been very badly overcooked because most of it (about 80%) had the consistency of lukewarm lard. (I say \"lukewarm\" because that was the temperature at which it arrived when we finally received our food.)\n\nThe experience was especially disappointing because it took *well* over 45 minutes to get our food in the virtually-empty restaurant.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Decent bottomless mimosas for brunch, but stick to those and perhaps a side of fries. *****Again, this review applies to the BRUNCH menu ONLY*****\n\nWe will try their non-brunch menu at some point and write another review then (hopefully a positive one, as I have heard that their dinner menu may upgrade soon).",

There are many tv's showing a variety of sports shows. The waitresses is revealing is her navel. What is this place trying to be? Not a destination location for fine food. My eggs benni was mediocre. The eggs and sauce were nice, the English muffin, not toasted and soggy. And the potatoes(?)' Savory white and mashed sweet potatoes. Not a good pairing for breakfast.

A couple times I wanted to get a full detail and the ticket attendant snippily said \"it's too late\" the first time I said OK and just got a regular car wash; the second time I came about 1pm and he said the same thing, I asked him what a good time was and he just ignored me and asked what car wash I wanted to get, so the lady at the front desk tells me to come before 12 next time. So my last run in with this same ticket attendant was yesterday, I was pulling up to the car wash under the direction of his hand motion and once I got out he told me in snippy and rude tone not to watch the front of my car and to watch him, Which I don't understand, I'm not going to drive forward when there's a car in front of me under your direction and not look at what I'm doing. So I go to the manager because at this point I know this guy is a bit rude, the manager tells me \"well he's been here 19 years and longer than me and I haven't had any complaints\" I said \"well that doesn't have anything to do with my experience and why I'm standing in your office at this moment and I'm coming to you because I'm giving you an opportunity to rectify it rather than just going to social media or writing a bad review\" he says \"well you can do that, we have thousands of people come through every day\" So here I am! The managers attitude was an \"I don't care about your experience because we have enough customers, we can lose one\" That will be my last time giving them a chance, I'm sure there are other car washes with thorough work and great customer service skills as well.",

The host was welcoming and the support staff was attentive and aware what was going on around them.  Staff gets a 5 star or (Starr)..lol\nNow lets talk about the food. First off, our meals were not bad. They were average.  They did however, lack flavor.  It might sound strange to say this, but our food and the space lacked identity. I feel like all Starr restaurants are known to have an identity and the food reflects that identity. This was definitely a weak point. This place was \"good\" but not what I assumed a Starr restaurant would be about.  We did attend there brunch a few time and thought it was very good, our meals at dinner were uneventful and a little  disappointing.",

  "text": "Took a tip from a local in Dunedin who suggested this restaurant and our experience was far from what she described. This was our first and definitely last time coming here. There was only two tables when we came in but it still took the waitress 10 minutes to seat us. The menus are about the size of a phone book and heavier than one too, but they do have lights inside of them which I thought was pretty cool. We asked for the fresh cooked bread for the table to snack on while we decided what we were all going to eat. When the waitress brought out the bread, she apologized and said they ran out and had to buy the bread from Winn Dixie...my whole table was a little taken back that she even was upfront about that. Not sure how an Italian restaurant can run out of their home made bread, especially when the place was dead. In the middle of ordering the appetizer our waitress just walked away pretending not to hear us. She did that a couple more times when we asked for a few more things for the table like steak sauce and lemons. I would NOT recommend the calamari, it came out shriveled up and dry. It took the waitress another 15 minutes to realize everyone's drinks at the table were empty before we had to flag her down to grab us all refills. I do have to say the shrimp scampi and the steak dinner special were really good and the cannoli was also. Management here should truly train their staff better, because the service was complete crap. There are a handful of other Italian places around Dunedin and I would for sure recommend to spend your money elsewhere instead of wasting it here.",

  "text": "Friday May 11 was such a beautiful evening that my husband and i decided to go somewhere with outdoor seating.  We were both excited about coming here as we had been to the previous restaurant at this location and were very pleased.  We thought we would be WOWed after reading the menu.  What we found was a pleasant but inattentive server and bus boys that seemed to be clueless.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had the poached pear salad.  The flavor was very good on the pears but for $8.50 I wanted more than 4 thin slices.  it was supposed to have smoked Gouda.  I think there was 6 pieces that appeared to be box shredded.  I could not find the craisins or walnuts and the greens were starting to turn brown.  My husband had the wedge salad.  Again, over priced for the quality and amount.  I had, as an entree, the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes.  They had no flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a lump of cheddar in the center and were overpowered by Old Bay seasoning.  My husband had the Seafood Pescatore which he said was OK.  I will say the desserts where beyond excellent.  We were told they were homemade so KUDOS to the baker.  We shared a Chocolate Mint Torte.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  The server, while she was pleasant, came over to take our order and then we did not see her again until she gave us our bill.  We asked for flatware as our food was served with no implements to eat it with.  Had we had the set ups at arrival we may have had a luke warm rather than cold meals.  When we asked for red wine glasses it too over 20 minutes for a bus boy to provide and when we asked for water you would have thought we had three heads each.  We will not be returning however, if the person who made the desserts opened a dessert eatery, we would frequent that establishment.",

The tequila was suppose to be inside, but we didn't taste a hint of it. That was disappointing. This was our first impression of the bars in ybor city. Not good at all.",

  "text": "I am an ex-server for olive garden. It is one of my favorite restaurants and I drove over half an hour to eat there with two of my friends on Thursday may 31st. Our servers were Tracey and mikayla, whose was training, and I was extremely disappointed in the service that we recieved.\nI'd like to highlight first the some service that met the outstanding expectations that I know olive garden expects.\nWhen we arrived we were seated right away and our server in training introduced herself fairly quickly. We were given adequate time to look at the menu and make our selections. Our first round of salad and bread sticks, along with our appetizer very quickly. After this though the whole atmosphere and attitude seemed to change.\nOur tray of breadsticks and salad stood empty for almost 20 minutes after that initial  round. One of the reasons I love olive garden is because of the refills on salad, soup, and breadsticks. While we waited on someone to recognize that we needed refills, a tray of dirty dishes sat out in the dining room for approximately 30 minutes across from our table. Our main courses came out before our second round of salad and breadsticks and when I recieved my entree the sauce in the ravioli de portabellas that I had ordered congealed and the entree was cold. I flagged down a server as no one had asked us how are meal was. Although my meal was replaced with no question, it came out after both of my friends were finished eating and had recieved to-go boxes, so I was eating my meal alone. After we were all done eating, everything was boxed up, and dishes were cleared we then waited over another 15 minutes for my dessert to-go and our check. Finally when we did receive our check it was the wrong one. Thankfully I was planning on paying with a credit card so I didn't just leave money on the table and walk out. \nAgain I am very disappointed in the service I recieved tonight. The problem with our service is that there was no direction from the server that was training the new employee. Tracey seemed to be more worried about a large party that was sitting behind us but made a point to mention in passing that mikayla better do good tonight because she was making her money. Now I understand the basis behind why trainees give their tips to their trainer, as I went through the training myself, but tracy was not guiding her, checking on the table or shadowing her anyway. I feel like mikayla was sent out to the wolves with no food.",

  "text": "I came for a conference. The total charge for my three night stay was over $1100 after taxes and resort fees. Even after paying this astronomical amount was I was still charged $8 for a microwaved breakfast sandwich and $16 for a small tube of neosporin. Lets not even talk about the restaurant prices. Lunch at the cafe for two- just ordering 3 small tapas plates (1 California roll was $12!!!!) and 2 alcoholic beverage each was a whopping $70 (not including tip). The resort was INCREDIBLY difficult to navigate and it took me and my coworkers over 20 min to find our rooms. There were limited breakfast options and the grab and go options had massive lines due to being understaffed. Even the shuttle to the airport was not complimentary. Taxis to downtown Nashville were $30 each way. Rooms were clean but needed to be checked better. I had no room service menu, the iron was cheap and leaked water right out of the holes (they brought me a brand new one and it did the same thing)- ruined a dress of mine. Lamp with appliance plugs was broken. I could hear screaming kids up to 11pm at night. I didn't even know how to get to the atrium outside my room. I felt trapped in a biosphere and would never return willingly to this place again. Overall, it completely overpriced and not a relaxing stay at all. For a \"world class resort\" here in the United States it pretty shameful. I've had a completely better stay at resorts in other countries that are 1/2 the price, go there instead!!!!!",

  "text": "This was really disappointing, normally diner food is really enjoyable and one of the people in our group had eaten here before. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which we had to wait for because the kitchen gave away the first one and tried to give the second one away until our waitress caught it. \n\nMy sandwich was okay, but I did notice the bread had mold on it which we quietly brought to our server's attention. She was very apologetic and brought it to the kitchen. She then came back out and explained the chef said it was from cutting spinach for the Eggs Florentine we had ordered. The spot was no where near where the bread had been sliced, and the color was more blue than green. It took a brief discussion with our server to have the sandwich removed from the check. So they're either cross contaminating the knives they're using or they're trying to serve their customers mold. We also never received the grits we ordered which they removed with no issue. \n\nJessica the waitress was very apologetic the whole time, and very sweet. The kitchen staff should be ashamed.",

First they offered outdoor seating which was a nice atmosphere for our \"date night\" until they seated someone behind us who decided to bring there dog out to eat. While this isn't necessarily a fault of the restaurant, it was an annoyance hearing the dog panting and choking on whatever scraps they were feeding it. Now onto the food. I ordered the chicken parm with broccoli as my side. I was told by the waitress that the chicken parm was out of this world. I've had better chicken parm from the Olive Garden. It was an oversized chicken finger with a boatload of cheese on top. The broccoli was very crunchy and tasted like biting into a garlic clove. The wife ordered Gnocchi's. She said they tasted like biting into a chunk of parmigiana cheese and the sauce was so thick it was hard for her to choke them down. The best part of the meal was the Cesar salad which was big enough for us to share. Since we didn't really eat our meal we did have room for dessert. The chocolate cake was pretty damn good!",

I know a lot of people might say racism doesn't exist anymore, but being in Philadelphia for two days & I haven't seen it more in my entire life. Walked into this place & was told the wait for dining would be about 20-25 mins, no problem. My boyfriend decided to get some beer from the bar where we were neglected by the first bartender. When we finally got seated, we placed our food order right away which was about 5:00PM. A couple who came in after us was able to get their food & drinks about 10 mins after walking in yet we still hadn't gotten ours even forty mins after. In that forty mins we asked our server twice how much longer it would be till our food was ready, both times he told us 'shortly'. After realizing another couple had gotten their food already & we asked him again which he then told us 'I have no control over the kitchen'. At this point, we walked out. I'm saying this is racism because after I took a good look around, I noticed my boyfriend & I were the ONLY colored couple there. People should realize we are humans just like them, & just like everybody else we pay money for a service.",

It has all the kitsch of Vegas or Disney, same prices, but no casino or entertainment. Not close to downtown Nashville. Would not voluntarily subject myself to the Gaylord opryland.",

The first time the service was good the second time, the cashier obviously did not want to be there which isnt a huge deal but ok. I paid 16 dollars for cookies and 2 small ice creams. I could understand if the cookies were something special but honestly ive had better cookies at frys. How is your whole business model based around cookies and there is absolutely no creativity in the cookie choices. The \"premium\" cookies have some flair but maybe try something other than chocolate. This place is way overpriced and not even that good. Im not wasting my money there again.",

JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH.\" I then emailed the owner to let him know how I was treated by one of his employees that was off duty. On 8/24/18 I called to talk with the owner. He said that he did not believe me because it did not sound like Marge. Marge has pulled the wool over the owners eyes too much. Other customers have told me that she has been rude to them, but they are afraid of her. The owner will do nothing to correct the problem. I can still press charges on Marge and I think I will. She did harass a federal contractor which would be a felony.",

  "text": "We had friends in town yesterday and decided to try Tank 13. I have eaten BBQ all over the country, and I was excited try some ribs from their smoker. I could not have been more disappointed. First, the ribs were not smoked--they were baked. There was no smoke flavor or smoke ring, and the ribs were completely inedible (I was asked if I wanted a box for my uneaten 1/2 slab... no thank you). When they arrived, I noticed that three of the ribs had been completely removed from meat. Smoked ribs done right should not be \"fall off the bone.\" They should have a little bite to them. These were easily the most disgusting ribs I have ever seen, and I would never have served them to any guests at my house (I regularly smoke meats in my own smoker). That I paid $14.50 for this terrible meal is a mistake I will never make again. And to top it off, the service was subpar--no one bothered to ask how our meal was, and it apparently wasn't strange that I left a completely uneaten 1/2 slab of ribs on my plate, when that was all I ordered. Will never recommend this place to anyone for food. I assume the beer is good (I didn't have anything to drink), and it would be a decent place to watch a ball game. But stay away from their BBQ... it is among the worst in the city (in a city with generally terrible BBQ), at least on the day I visited.",

We went for the last show at 10pm on Saturday night. The whole band was half asleep. No energy. No soul. Sour faces. Reluctantly getting up to play. Eyes closed when they aren't playing. All frowns. It was really sad...like they were overworked horses. It really killed the mood. Understandably, the audience was all stiff because of it. Didn't feel like a jazz band at all. The band leader on piano kept talking, but we couldn't hear any of it because he's so soft spoken. No drinks sold inside, but they let you bring in drinks from outside. 40min show.

The bartender / waitress was oblivious to our request for better service, and by the time she was done ruining to the back, for anyyhing she needed, the oysters were getting warm due to the fact they were not served on ice.

We have to do better people! We ordered a total of 6 different brunch menu items and all were horrible. \n\nThe spinach and feta omelet was the best thing. The shrimp and salmon were over cooked. The grits were waayy too stiff. I could go on but I won't. Very disappointing.",

Overall food and service was absolutely sub- standard. Most definitely will not return.",

I called and they said to bring in the receipt to get the $ back. I went in today and told the cashier about the problem and she rolled her eyes and me and started the process of giving the money back. After about 25 minutes of standing there with a long line behind me and only one other cashier open, I thanked her for taking the time to do the returns. She replied \"well it would've been faster if you brought in the items\" and rolled her eyes again. I was told to bring in only the receipt and the items I had purchased was yarn. Therefore, the yarn was already used in my projects! I left the store by saying \"have a great rest of your day\". The cashier (Maryann) didn't even look at me and replied by saying \"ok\".

They notified me of several repairs they thought I should make, but there was no heavy sales pitch to convince me to follow through on the repairs.  The wait time was reasonable, and the service personnel were courteous and friendly.  The reason I only gave two stars, however, is that, without asking, one of the service representatives \"zeroed\" my trip odometers.  I can understand why someone would think this was no big deal, however, I depend on both trip odometers to measure mileage for business purposes.  Those measurements are vital to my business expenses, and since I hadn't looked at either recently, I now have no idea how many miles to charge for my business mileage.  Of course, I didn't mention to the jiffy lube personal not to touch the odometers because it never crossed my mind that they would.  I mean, all I went in for was an oil change.  Why did they change the trip odometers for a service that didn't have anything to do with the odometers, especially since I mentioned I didn't want any notification of how many miles I had driven for when I was due for my next oil change?  The inconvenience this has caused me is quite extreme.  Please be aware, that if you too depend on your trip odometers, make certain to mention to the jiffy lube personnel that should leave well enough alone!",

My partner, a vegan who tends to hit up the asparagus salad, complained that it was mostly (very hard) bread. On our most recent visit, the duck salad just tasted off, not spoiled, but off. The time before the blue cheese and fig salad (alas--has now been taken off the menu!) had poor quality greens. They've eliminated our favorite bruschetta from the menu--which is the picture that is prominent on Yelp. My partner won't be willing to go back for a while.

Most of their pre-arranged menu items are spicy options. While I like spice every now and then, it doesn't always like me (old age means we live and breathe indigestion). There is a build your own option, so I thought I would go for that. You get 4 vegetables and anything else is extra. The average price of the pre-arranged menu items is about $10. So I figured the base of a build your own would be about 8 or 9 and then you add. As I'm going through the line, I start to get my veggies and choose avocado. \"That will be an extra $2\"....... TWO DOLLARS?? I can buy a whole avocado across the street for $2?! I say no thank you and move on to the cheese. \"That will be $.79 extra\" I mean... okay, that won't break the bank, frustrating that it's not included but okay, throw it in. I move down to the meat, I'll have chicken. \"That'll be an extra $3 dollars.\" .......... ..... seriously??? I very politely took a hard pass on that. Because in order to get anything with substance and taste, this wrap is looking to be close to $20. I understand that you are paying for freshness and convenience, but there is a line. At least I was hopeful for something tasty once my veggie wrap was complete. Unfortunately, it was dry and the only flavor I could strongly taste was some kind of blue cheesy situation (that I didn't ask for so I'm still not sure what it was). We both painfully threw over half of our overpriced meals away, because they just weren't good. On a positive note, the service was great and the workers seemed very happy and polite! The idea is awesome bc everyone loves a good salad, just not quite the right bang for your buck.",

  "text": "I really like how spacious this location is - the different rooms, and the lounge with a full bar. The staff is friendly. However, the food has not translated well from the mothership in Seminole Heights.  \nMy first visit was brunch, my ramen was barely room temp. when it arrived, and the broth was thick and gloppy - the place had very few customers at the time. I was too pressed for time, to send it back, so I had to eat it as is.\nHad lunch there recently and decided to try the Miso ramen.  The broth was ok, but somewhat overpowered by the taste of that prechopped garlic some restaurants use for convenience - it does not flatter the broth at all.  Prechopped garlic is a travesty.\nAlso, I would much rather have tofu or seitan, than Impossible burger (what little there was).  The final thing that really dragged it down is that there was literally almost a whole onion's worth of barely cooked, large onion slices.  I had to pull a bunch out, so I wasn't getting a giant mouthful of onion with every bite. If there were bean sprouts in there, I really couldn't detect them. With a veg. ramen, it would be nice to have some kind of mushrooms - just more texture in general.  It feels like the keep it boring so you'll pay more money for extras.  It's $13.50 already.  I have enjoyed the Seminole Heights location and feel like the vibe is way tighter and they are much more on top of everything - I will stick to SH for now.\n**my main reason for putting this up on Yelp is that I contacted them after the cold noodle experience and got crickets.  I don't expect a ticker-tape parade, but maybe just a simple \"thanks for the feedback\".",

The staff didn't mention that they would be making anymore either.    Instead, I had to order a regular oolong milk tea and also 2 grapefruit fresh teas for my family.  There were maybe two people in line in front of me, but my order took 20 minutes.  Some of the staff seemed to be working hard while others were constantly checking their cell phone.  When I finally arrived at my car, I tried the oolong milk tea and it was literally just milk (lactaid or milk powder?) with tapioca.  There was no tea taste at all.  The color of my drink was white.  The grapefruit juices were just ok at all.  It was also inconvenient that they didn't offer a bag or tray until I asked since I had 3 large drinks to carry out.  Overall, the place is unorganized and definitely has room for improvement.  With so much competition nearby, I hope they can improve since the space is great.",

The inside of the hotel is less than impressive, the rooms are old and almost dirty looking, there is no pool or any other amenities. The parking situation is terrible, they force you to valet at $44/night and when we arrived there wasn't even a valet \"on duty\" per the lady working the front desk. The housekeeping staff didn't even make one of our beds and there was no WiFi password offered. The staff seemed largely incompetent as they told us twice that our room was ready for check in, only when we arrived we were told that it wasn't ready.

I've visited prior to the lunch rush, during lunch rush and even after.. All the same, miserable and almost like you are inconveniencing them just by walking in the door. So I started ordering online instead to skip the interaction only to find out the two times I have when I go to pick up (well after my designated pickup time) they haven't even started my order. No apologies, nothing just a \"we are starting the order now\" and this last time \"you are going to have to wait I just noticed you're order\"!! The woman that works there, mostly from 11-4 Monday through Friday is whom I encounter most and should be switched to food prep in the back or fired. My coworkers have all expressed the same complaints. I am certain this location will not stay open for long and I plan to take my business to Choolah around the corner instead!

Just so you know, as of today, July 30, 2018, this truck is still on their lot and is now marked at $25,900, more than $2,000 less than what I had offered to pay for it, and a full $4,000 less than their original price of $29,900 that they weasled me around on. Car dealerships and salesman ARE all the same, and they will screw you the first chance they get. If Crown Honda weren't so GREEDY, they would have made a sale at $27,986 and be more than $2,000 better off than they are now.",

The owner Larry will come to you first and give you a great presentation as if you'll be able to eat off your floors. Well let me tell you when I saw these 2 jokes walk into my moms condo I already knew this job was going to be a nightmare. They use the cheapest equipment. Stuff bought at Walmart or Target. No commercial cleaning equipment. They used one rag to dust the entire place. I kept telling them I feel a film on all the furniture. Their excuse was that it is post construction and it takes a few times. Well after they left I grabbed a bottle of windex and a paper towel and the film magically disappeared. Then they used a cheap little steamer machine to clean the floors. I looked at them after they dried and they still had debris and dirt on the tiles. Again they said it was hard after one cleaning to get all that perfectly clean. Then why did Larry the owner assure me it would be perfect. They charged me over $330 for a tiny one bedroom apt that I had to clean all over by myself. WASTE IF MONEY!!!!!",

The bread falls apart and the sandwich just doesn't have very much flavor.  It would be better to serve the fries and slaw on the side (and season the fries) and just put lettuce, tomato, onion, etc. on the sandwich.  I've also had a burger, which was dry and fell apart because it had too much stuff on it.\n\nThis seems more like a place you'd go to for drink specials or because it's convenient, not for the food.",

Just after filling our drinks, the ice ran out in the drink machine. And both iced teas (both sweet and unsweet) ran out as well. It took 50 minutes for our food to arrive. Tables around us were at no time cleared off/cleaned. We were in the restaurant for more than hour; at no time did they make an effort to replenish the drink machine station. My daughter ordered the fried shrimp platter--it was supposed to come with shrimp, fries, onion rings, hush puppies, and toast. The toast was burned (buried at the bottom of the platter) and there were no hush puppies. We requested the hush puppies--they never brought us any, even though it was part of our order. While were there other customers complained about the service and food. And some left before being served.",

They put us by the open door even though we asked to be inside because it was chilly out.  Waited 15 minutes before our waitress even came around. We should have walked out then, but we thought the food would make up for it. Wrong!  This waitress kept having her table's food and drinks being returned for being wrong.  She couldn't get anything right.  My friend and I ordered the try 3, which comes out of pots and placed in bowls, so we should have been served quickly. No, we waited an hour.  Every time I saw the waitress, which wasn't often, she said it was on it's way out. When it did come out, the jambalaya was cold and the crawfish etoffee was lukewarm and the gumbo had no meat in it. What a waste of our time. Tourist trap I'm sure because it's on Canal, so stay away.",

I got the pan seared sea bream and she got the rabbit. All I can say is that both meals were almost flavourless. The fish tasted like tilapia you buy from Safeway and throw in the oven. My brother and I caught a rabbit when we were teenagers at my cabin in the foothills and bbq'd it after butchering it ourselves and made a much better piece of meat then was served to us last night. Every single aspect of the food was underwhelming, there was no wow factor that a 40 dollar dish anywhere else has. The word bland was used by both of us with every part of both our meals. Our server asked how our meals were and I was completely honest with him. He took it very graciously, and didn't charge us any of our 39 dollar alcohol tab to try and make amends. Highly unlikely either of us will ever go back. Mucho burrito would be a better choice for a night out...",

  "text": "Picked up a large with sausage, green peppers, and black olives the cost $9.50. The only good thing about the pizza was the crust and the price. As another reviewer mentioned, they don't even out the dough so there was substantial more at the top of the pizza while the bottom was falling apart with the ingredients. The pizza was not hot, even after warming it for 20 seconds, very soggy, and the toppings were horrible (looks like they don't use real sausage). Pizza was very inconsistent, such as not being uniformly warm, sloppy, thin sauce, and cheese that easily slide off the pizza. Some of the guys look like they are in drugs, which is not surprising due to the poor quality of their pizza. This was one of the worst pizzas I have ever eaten! Folks that think this pizza is good need to have their head examined! I doubt those folks travel much outside the country let alone the local area. Delco standards are so low....:(",

  "text": "I have to be honest, I'm shocked at how bad this place actually is. We stopped by here Sunday for some sandwich's to go. Big mistake! We ordered a variety for us and some friends.\n\nPresentation wise, all the food looked good. We ordered pastrami sandwich. It was terrible! Overly salty and covered in lettuce. The rye bread was by far the best part. The turkey club was equally as bad. The turkey was beyond dry and the bacon wasn't very fresh. You could tell it was reheated, it was chewy but rock hard. The Italian hoagie flat out tasted funny. The meat was cut super thick and it was also very slimy. The hoagie lacked seasoning but it was covered in onions. Due to the taste and look of it we trashed it. The pierogis were easily forgettable. They were your typical stuff and not very good. They turkey special, again the turkey was dry. The thousand island was good but again something out of a jar, cole slaw was the same. All\nOf the sandwiches are large but that's not always good. I'd prefer quality over quantity but that's just me.  The cheesesteak egg rolls were the best part of our meal. They were actually edible.\n\nOverall it was a terrible experience and we would not return. To say we were disappointed would be an understatement. It's really hard to mess up one sandwich, let alone 6.",

This makes me so sad because this was my favorite local Italian restaurant, especially for take out. Their Caesar Salad used to taste homemade and delicious. Now the dressing tastes like it comes from a bottle. Our mozzarella sticks had O% cheese inside, our pizza crust was tough, and the chicken parm tasted off. Usually Fiorello's food is ON POINT. I'm just not sure why their quality has gone downhill.",

  "text": "COCKROACHES!  This was our first time here, and we really looked forward to it.  Alas, it was a disaster, which had nothing to do with the food. That being said, we will NEVER go back. \n Sure, the food took a long time to come out, and one entree arrived about 15 minutes after the other, but we can deal with that.  But just after we finally got our food, there came a COCKROACH crawling up the wall next to our table!  We told the waiter and he took a napkin and squashed it.  Then he split, without the slightest apology. Despite that, we decided to suck it up and continue our meals. Not 1 minute later ANOTHER cockroach appeared, this time on one of the PLATES containing our food!  Needless to say, that was just too much. We all got up to leave, and I asked to see the manager. The workers that we told said the manager \"just left\". Our waiter was nowhere to be found, either. (I suspect they were one and the same guy.) One of the workers (a woman) said \"they (the cockroaches) come from upstairs\". So obviously this is an ongoing problem. We received not the slightest apology from anyone.  We will never return, of course.  And I will report them to the health department on Monday (today is Saturday).",

Many of the staff are new -- ok -- train them -- no one could explain the Tuesday Night specials -- basically a sign on the table stating $4 craft beers  -- which was completely different than the other sign that talks about happy hour from 4-7 -- so, craft beer (as generally defined as Not Budweiser) is loosely defined by the bartender as Local only -- so the \"craft beer\" brewed in the next town over didn't qualify??  WTF. Another waitress told us everything under $6 (so only 4 of the 20+ draft choices) and another told us all the drafts were essentially half price?\n\nI'll be shocked to see this place still in business in 6 months!!

Ok, Sunday morning 11:00, expected that. However, 90 min later, still not sat. Approached hostess and was told we were next table. Waited another 20 min. watching empty tables not get cleared.

Where was the Benedict specials of the day? Again, no longer. New menu equivalent to a Denny's, nothing special.

  "text": "I have been coming to GSR for a very long time, to the point that many of the employees know me or my husband. I have been to Lex many times, mostly getting a VIP but sometimes just to enjoy a nice out. My most recent visit to see Fetty Wap was horrible, it's sad to me that an establishment like Lex doesn't have a better management and is completely unorganized.  To start we got in the VIP line and our ticket that had our table # was lost, so we waited a good 45 minutes to even get through the door.  I had already given them my credit card when we got there. When the hostess came to our table and took our order she asked for my card, I told her I had already given it and she said ok she would look in the back. She came back about 15 minutes later and said they couldn't find it. Me and my husband had to go out to the front and ask around to look for it. Apparently it was randomly in on of the black books they carry out front.  So now the hostess leaves to get our drinks.  They never brought our mixers or our ice so the hostess had to get everything herself, she was actually working very hard.  I appreciated her. We finally get to having a drink about 2 hours later. \nIf that were the last issue I don't think I would be so frustrated. I read another review where the manager responded they don't deny guest water.  I walked to the empty front bar to ask for water and the bartender told me they don't provide water I would have to buy it. After I just paid for my VIP, I see one of the front guys I believe his name was Roman and I tell him. He said don't worry I got you, he sends a bucket of water with a receipt for $36 I told the random hostess I'm not paying for this I just wanted one water cup for my husband who wasn't feeling well. She gets Roman and he acts like he had never spoke to me and didn't know what I was talking about and the girl snatches the water off the table and walks away.",

Given the plethora of amazing Italian American restaurants within spitting distance - this was really disappointing. And even more disappointing was the staff. They all seemed really unhappy to be there and unhappy we were there. Rude and unsmiling. (The only friendly person was the bus person - he was lovely.) And they told us quite abruptly after dessert that we needed to leave (immediately) because they needed to seat another party. I worked in restaurants for years - and it was very unprofessional and done very rudely. Sometimes you do have to ask a larger party to move along - but do it with some grace and some forewarning.

  "text": "Upon arriving for my 7:30 reservation a bit early I was told quite quickly by the host that it would be about 5 mins. That was it, no please feel free to grab a drink at the bar, have a seat while you wait, nothing. After about 10 mins waiting I made my way to the bar to order a glass of wine for me and my guest. The bartender walked by multiple times without acknowledging me or offering a menu, I took a menu from a guest next to me. When he finally come to take my order there was no hello, no how are you, no sentence at all. It was just a simple word.. Drink? No smile nothing at all to make me feel welcomed.\n\nWhen we were finally sat, our server came by. Once again no smile, no hello, how are we tonight? Just her name and weather we wanted tap or bottle water. Through out the course of our meal, she was inattentive, in-personable, barely smiling or trying to interact with us. \n\nThe biscuits they dropped at the beginning of our meal where the highlight of the evening, the butters perfect and the biscuits wonderfully fluffy and layered to perfection\n\nWe started with some snacks, pig ears came out overly salted, and room temp and chewy. As if they'd been sitting a minute. The conch fritters were good, well seasoned and the sauce added great balance.\n\nWe finished up and what I'm assuming was a service manager or floor manager came by with our second course... mind you we had not been cleared or re-silvered from our first course. Instead of turning around and clearing us before dropping food, he simply dropped the courses and walked away.. coming back after a few minutes to clear the dirty plates and drop new share plates. \n\nOur second courses were the gulf shrimp with Calabrian Chile's which were tasty, and a very good dish... the tuna tartar on the other hand was again extremely salty, maybe due to seasoning before considering that salty tobiko/caviar of some type was going on top which made the dish almost inedible. \n\nThis time our plates were cleared and we did get re silvered. For our entrees we ordered the \"acclaimed\" curry goat and the red fish dish.\n\nNeither dish wowed me. The fish was one dimensional, there was no textural contrast in the dish. The sauce, the fish, the garnish, was all soft, room temp, and this time extremely under seasoned. It was lacking some sort of acidity and crunch to wake it up. The goat was under seasoned as well and lacking depth. Though the gnocchi was very well cooked and made it was not enough to save the dish. The sad thing is, even though our distaste was apparent, the server made no inquire as to why we hadn't eaten our entrees. no manager came to check on us, it seemed as though the staff was just floating through their night. \n\nI expected a lot more from the service and food for a restaurant as widely acclaimed as this one is. Nothing about this evening screamed best new chef, James beard award nominee, or eater hot 38. This was appalling service from start to finish and the food to match. Definitely sucks when you're on vacation and this is your one special meal and you get the bill and are out 200 dollars after tip for something you wish never happened.\n\nWe ended up skipping dessert and going someplace else.\n\nEdit* Extremely disappointed at the fact that I have yet to receive any response from the management. You would think that they would want to at least try to redeem them selves for this but alas... just floating through on the laurels",

I explain to them that the gift card was $15 and since the total was 15.17 they owed me .83 cents. THEN.... The teenage female manager gets involved trying to convince me that I have a balance on the gift card! After explaining twice the SIMPLE math involved she gives me my change which was incorrect so I waited again to get the correct amount of change.

  "text": "The reason I give more than one star is that at least I can grab an Upland Wheat on tap. Otherwise, my experiences here consistently fail.\n\nI was a regular at the Bloomington Upland when I was at IU, and I rejoiced when I found out about this taproom upon my relocation to the Indy/Carmel area.\n\nThe rejoicing ended once I ordered food and felt the atmosphere. The food is inconsistently average. The atmosphere is not welcoming; it is not the home I knew and loved at the Bloomington Upland. I voiced this once to the manager on duty, and he quickly shut down my opinion. \"This is not Bloomington,\" he said. But, this is Upland. My experience did not match my expectation of the brand I had come to love. \n\nI am compelled to write this review now that I find out that samples are $1 each. If you want me to become a fan of your beer, you should at least be willing to invest in shelling out .5 oz of the stuff to develop loyalty. \n\nI am saddened to write this, as every so often I try giving this place a chance in the hopes that my views will change. Maybe next time I come, I'll enjoy it a bit more.",

The third time we stopped to get a drink and the bartender was one of rudest people I have run into.  There were several people at the bar but only one bartender.  We had been sitting waiting for a while when the bartender asked someone who had just walked in what they wanted.  I said something and the bartender came over, insulted me, and was extremely hostile.  I realize he was busy, and may not have known I was there first but that was no excuse for his behavior.  If you can't be civil then maybe you shouldn't be in a customer service job",

  "text": "I don't get it. I really don't. This is a review for drinks only. My husband and I went after a happy hour down on Passyunk to grab one last drink and finally check out ITV. Our server was a bit slow to get to our table and there seemed to be an air of resentment when we said we were only drinking. We both ordered the drink called 4 down, 7 letters and my husband really liked it. I guess I underestimated the Campari a bit (like a dumbass) but I was not a fan of mine. The service was painfully slow even though a table of 6 had been checked on several times while we were waiting to place our drink orders. From a practicality standpoint I get it- bigger table usually equals bigger tips esp. when they are getting food but how about not being so obvious about it? \n\nWe waited for several minutes and I usually would rather die than return a well mixed drink to the bar but as it was my last drink of the night and I really couldn't get past the bitterness of the Campari, so I waited for more than a few minutes to kindly ask the server if she would mind switching out my drink (a bit of a pain in the ass I know) but she never checked on how we liked our drinks so my husband decided to go upto the bar and ask directly. They were all professional about it but you could tell there was a bit of irritation there. The server wasn't downright rude but there was a not friendly, resentful air to the whole thing. Some of the staff needs to work on their friendliness.  \n\nDid I mention a lot of the menu seemed a bit overpriced even for Passyunk? My best advice is to save your money and just splurge on Laurel one night- its absolutely worth it and the service we received there was not the least bit pretentious or resentful.",

We got seated at around 11 when it wasn't super busy and after our waitress took our order it took 50 min to get our food. We actually hadn't seen our waitress at all and had to ask a different waitress where our food was. People that were seated after us got their food before us. When my pancakes arrived they were extremely cold and when I told the waitress she took them to the kitchen then came back to say : \"what do you want us to do with them like microwave them or remake them im not sure what they can do\" I was honestly so confused because if you as an employee don't know what the kitchen can do then why and how are you working here?? Once my eggs Benedict came they were alright, the bread was extremely hard and it took me awhile to cut through it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles which were good. At the end when we asked for our check we waited another 20 minutes for her to come tell us to stand in line and tell her what table we are in order to get the check. Truly an awful experience. I honestly think it was all because of our awful waitress who if I ever come back I will request to not have her.",

That the owners of Zeppoli serve 5 star food (and it is) while you are expected to sit in a chair made for a kindergartener is beyond comprehension. I walked in, looked at those $5 wooden chairs with no cushion, no real backs and was so disappointed this is how I was supposed to \"relax\" and enjoy my meal. Then I sat, and the featherweight chair slid around the floor every time I breathed; also had to put my bag on the hard floor... That everything we ordered was wonderful just makes this all the more frustrating. Why on earth do they not immediately remedy this situation by purchasing ANY kind of decent chairs for this one tiny room??? It's inexcusable. They will never be a really great restaurant so long as they make ignorant, careless choices that directly detract from the dining experience. I'd sooner get my meal to go than make a reservation here again. Please invest in your business. This is all so avoidable.",

Another five minutes went by, and I was told they could only make cinnamon or vanilla icing for a nut allergy and that's it.  I have been to Sundaes in the heart of the summer where they would open a new tub of ice cream and wash equipment for my son. I asked for the manager who took another ten minutes to refund my money. When I expressed my disappointment that they wasted my time and seems to be insensitive to the group of children that were just disappointed by not being able to have their order (3 of the 4 had nut allergies). Nobody cared. I asked to reach out to the owner. The owner looked at me and said you got your money back and walked away. Not a great way to run a business. I watched the donuts come out in the half hour I waited and they were sloppy in the prep area and sloppy in the presentation boxes.

So while we were waiting, we saw food finally getting handed to the people in front of us. I saw what my son had ordered and even commented to my husband that i bet that was my son's food. It was a tall truck so we could see what the people in the cab were doing. We saw them go through the food. They went through everything then handed everything back through the window. I saw the worker set the food down on the counter. Finally that customer got their food. When it was our turn,  we drove up to the window and the worker handed us that same food. The same food that had been sitting there for the past 10 minutes and that was in another person's car and other people's hands had gone through. I said i knew it was old food and i saw what he had done.....so he yelled and huffed at me. Needless to say....i drove off. I will not ever go back there. Disgusting!!!!!!",

  "text": "Quick shout outs - our server, Jordan, worked really hard to make our meal enjoyable.  He was prompt and responsive and my family and I really appreciated his effort.\n\nNow to the review - the food was pretty good, when it came out correct...We are vegetarian and ordered the Brussel sprouts (without bacon), two pizzas (margharita and potato) and one pasta (arrabiata).  When the person brought the Brussel sprouts to the table, she said there was no meat...but in my first bite I had a piece of bacon. Definitely disappointed from that experience.  Luckily they paid extra attention to the rest of our order and made sure everything was correct.  I think the kitchen at this place is very overwhelmed...\n\nThis actually leads to the main reason for the 2-star review.  We made a reservation for 6 at 7:30p.  When we got there at 7:25p they told us that the had 2 other parties of 6 that needed to be seated before us and the kitchen was running behind.  We said that we had a reservation but apparently so did the other parties.  Why in the world would they book three reservations at the same time when they clearly didn't have the space/ability to accommodate?! We heard similar comments about why even make a reservation from most of the people waiting in the waiting area.  When we finally got seated...30 mins after our reservation...it was at a make shift table that was extremely tight without sufficient space for all our plates. \n\nThe food was the redeeming quality for my experience.  My brother said that he had a similar experience the last time he came here for dinner.  Eventually the negative experience is going to outweigh the quality of food...and I feel that's going to happen pretty quick. They need to figure something out to turn around the service, and fast.",

  "text": "My husband and I hyped up burger study thinking it was going to be a great place to eat, especially being in the St Elmo's family. We visited Burger study during devour downtown. We reserved our table on OpenTable and had no problem getting in. Our servers name was Justin and was really great to begin with. Once we ordered our burgers we continued to talk with our friends. About three minutes after our orders were taken, I completely forgot that I hadn't informed our server that I had celiac disease and needed a gluten-free bun. Justin immediately acted annoyed and frustrated with us. He went back to the kitchen to make sure to get this corrected. He did not return back to our table for over 20 minutes. He asked if a manager had come to speak with me and I said no. A manager never stopped by the entire night as Justin said they would. Our food came out great and we actually really enjoyed our meal. However the rest of our visit was really horrible. The server continue to treat us like total crap. It was frustrating for us because while we understood it was devour downtown and Justin was busy, we still figured we would be treated like human beings. My husband and I have both been in the service industry, and we understand it's frustrating when people forget to tell you things such as an allergy. We even apologized on her own behalf to Justin and said repeatedly that we completely forgot to tell him and apologized for any inconvenience WE caused HIM. However he still continue to treat us like absolute garbage. All this to say we definitely will never be back to Burger study. I'm not going somewhere I am treated differently because of an allergy that I can't help. We'll continue to go to St Elmo's, as they treat us with respect and are OVERLY accommodating when it comes to my allergy. It's a real shame that Burger Study can't be the same.",

Let me start with what I ordered. I had the mofongo (chicken) and yellow rice with black beans. The mofongo was tasty but the salt content was unacceptable. The chicken was clearly left overs from the previous day. It was dry almost like a jerky. The yellow rice was bland and so dry from sitting in the warmer all day that it almost seeemed undercooked or raw. The beans were salty and lacking in flavor as well. I am not even an expert at dominican cuisine but from an avid lover of the culture I cook better dominican food than this place in my home. I will never eat here again.",

Well, a couple of employees walked by and didn't acknowledge us. One girl holding a tray of food came to us and looked annoyed asked how many and got some menus and proceeded to walk us to a table without saying another word. There were only about 5 tables occupied. Food took foreverrrrrrr to come out. My husbands food was burnt and he eats just about anything and it was hard for him to eat. Also almost broke a tooth on the burnt bits of what was suppose to be prime rib. My sons food (he's 3) took the longest to come out. He got Mac n cheese and it came out after sliders and a prime rib sandwich. It was also scorching hot so we ended up having to pack it up cause it was just too hot to eat and we had already finished our food. Our waitress was super nice though. But it's obvious that there is no manager or anyone in charge...it's kinda like a free for all from the couple of times I've gone. I use to love Parrot Pete's when it first opened...completely not worth your time now. There are so many better options elsewhere.",

  "text": "So my experience at Tsunami Japanese Steakhouse has been interesting. I'm new to the area so I wanted to find a good Japanese restraunt and stumbled upon this by word of mouth. So I thought I would try it and got some sushi rolls. They were pretty good until I found hair in my food at the bottom mixed in with the sauce. I called there immediately telling them about my issue and when I thought they would graciously apologize profusely and act surprised about how that hair got into my food. All I got was attitude and a receptionist that made me feel like all I wanted was free food instead of just wanting to enjoy my meal hair free. They offered me store credit or to remake it but why would I want to eat there again after I found your hair in my food? How do I know it won't happen again? And did the manager make an appearance on the phone oh hell no she made the receptionist handle the situation like it's a routine thing oh yeah just give them credit and shoo them away. Awful place awful business. Don't waste your money eating here if there is hair in the food what else do you think might be in the food?",

  "text": "Poor service from host through lunch. \nWe had a large group (13) so they made us split up. They refused to even seat us near each other even though there were enough empty tables to put both groups next to each other. We were all seated by 2:50. Not even during a lunch rush. The party of 6 had menus when they sat down and had their drink order take right away and good order fairly quickly. The party of seven had no menus  for over 20 minutes and only after we asked 3x. No one took our drink order until after we had been seated for 30 minutes and I spoke to an employee standing by the doorway to the elevator.  We did not actually order our food or our first beverages until 3:25.  My first beverage was made incorrectly. Our waiter said he knew that but did nothing to correct the issue. \n\nA trainer came over to inform us our server was in training and today was his last day of training so he was trying to go solo. She told US we needed to give him a hard time for the errors. I told her that is not our place. She needed to address it and she may want to give him more support in training. \n\nFood finally came around 4:00. The party of 5 was completely done eating. So we're the smaller parties they say at the two empty tables near us. Most things came out correctly except for the smoked chicken. Two of us ordered 1/2 orders. Both orders came out full. The manager eventually reduced our food bill (not including any drinks) by 50%.  We finally got our bill about 4:35. But our waiter did not fix what he charged for the chicken so we still paid more than we should have.  \n\nWe finally got out of there about 2:45. Almost 2 hours after being seated. We did package up our leftovers and shared with Nashville's homeless. Saw a lot of need along Broadway. \n\nAll in all, not the experience I expected and not a place I would suggest to others without a lot of warning about what could happen.",

I did not notice the time when I went to pick up my prints knowing that they close at 6pm on Saturdays. I was on my way at 5:50pm so I figured I would give them a courtesy call and let them know I was on my way. Well the male that answered the phone said sorry but I lock the door at 6pm so if u are not here by that time I cannot let you in past 6pm. So I said ok that's fine I understand company policy, I hope I make it. I literally pulled up at 5:57pm as he was locking the door. I ran up to the door, but since it was locked he just pointed at his clock inside and said no it's 6pm. I was trying to tell them the actual time was before 6pm and all I needed to do was run in and grab my prints! \nHe was just smiling and laughing and pointing at his stupid clock, which I'm sure if he looked at his cell phone it would have said 5:57pm! \n\nI have worked in customer service for 15years!

The staff was also quite nice.  Right there - best Chinese buffet I've ever been to!\n\nThe sushi was... what it needs to be to keep the operating cost down.  Most was meh.  The mixed tempura dumpling type thing was original, but not great.  The spicy tuna roll was... actually ok!  It had a big chunk of imitation crab (dat operating cost), and the rice was dry, but I think I snarfed down six of them and felt like I had a win for the day.\n\nThe rest of the stuff was pretty much to be expected.  There was the assortment of heavily-breaded meats in different sauces.  A non-breaded \"spicy\" chicken which wasn't bad at all.  Wonton soup (can't go wrong.)  Highlight of the day was when I stumbled upon the gyoza (pot-stickers, fried dumplings, etc) complete with good sauce.\n\nI do feel like I cheated myself by not trying the Mongolian.  Next time.  Yes, I will be back, if only to try the Mongolian and have some more fried dumplings.",

No matter the time of day, it seems to get pretty rowdy and my friends and I have had drinks spilled on us on multiple occasions. Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was \"too bad\". Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service. No longer wasting our time and money here, and we advise our friends and family to do the same. It is too much of a hit-and-miss to come here and attempt to have a good time.",

The room was fine, and the balcony view was fine, but the food was terrible.  Everything fried and then thrown in a chaffing pan, which is a great way to turn fried food into mush.  The food was bland and mostly cool to cold. The fish was super-fishy tasting and mushy.  The muffaleta sandwiches were stale.  The tortilla chips were under a heating lamp, but were stale, and the salsa bland and watery.  The drink prices were high ($6 for a beer).  Overall, I thought it was a very poor bargain, and would not recommend this venue for Mardi Gras parade watching to anyone.  I understand that Mardi Gras is a good time for local businesses to make money, but it would be nice if they tried to reciprocate high prices with really good service.  Lucy's fell far short on this day.",

  "text": "I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody. I stayed here for a convention, for a total of nine nights, and from when we checked in to the moment we checked out, it was nothing but a terrible experience.\nOur room hadn't been serviced from the previous stay, so imagine our displeasure when we open up to find trash everywhere and the beds unmade, towels on the floor, etc., after having been traveling since 4:30am. We were compensated with a free meal, but honestly they shouldn't have let us check into that room if it wasn't ready!\nWe were out the following day and came back to our air conditioning unit having leaked all over the place, a giant puddle on the floor and the closet shelves soaked, ruining some items that belonged to my friend. It took two hours for the front desk people to move us after multiple attempts to contact them and even going down there to speak to someone in-person (turns out our new room was ready all along, but they of course didn't tell us, and made it sound like we'd be leaving immediately when we didn't). It took them three days to replace the damaged items and hand back clean laundry that had to be washed from the leak. After they offered us a free meal again, we demanded to have a night comped due to stress and miscommunication, a request we again had to fight tooth and nail for.\nThen, more laundry had to be done, as we were there for over a week. My friend brought her clothes down on Tuesday and didn't get them back until Thursday night, after bugging them for three days, and no one had even sent them out to be cleaned until Thursday morning! I understand the 4th was a holiday, but every time we went down there to inquire about it, no one would know what the hell we were talking about and it would take at least a half hour to gain some sort of information, which was usually a lie.\nWe finally got so fed up that we called Hilton corporate. Even though this is a franchised location and there wasn't much they could do from their end, we figured they should at least know what's going on since the upper management here is so disorganized and can barely handle a conference of around 1,100 people. They said we deserved to not have to pay for our room due to the way the trip had been going and all we'd endured. The hotel, however, didn't see it that way.\nWe were able to speak to the General Manager after the front desk employees had tried to hinder us from doing so for two days, and he was a very kind fellow and I think deserved to know what his guests were experiencing.\nWe were given a generous discount, but when we had checked out we'd wanted to split the bill and they were going to charge me double what my friend would've paid. One of the managers at the desk said, and I quote, \"Well, you have so many discounts, that's what screwed it up,\" to which I replied that the reason why we had so many discounts was because we'd been dealing with their terrible employees all week, spending all our free time either at the desk or on the phone with guest services to get an answer from someone about an issue we were having. Eventually, they were able to split the bill and print paper copies of the receipt, however it took a lot longer than it should have and I've never felt so disrespected.\nHousekeeping services are also spotty. For three days in a row, they didn't take out the trash in our room (they did take out the bathroom trash, but our other bucket was overflowing), which meant more unnecessary calls to guest services. They had even called us very early one morning and rudely told us to pick up my friend's replaced items from the leak, because \"They were cleaning and didn't want to look at it.\" They also didn't give us another box of tissues or more toilet paper until we called and asked, twice (really?! They should've seen we had none!); there was one day where they made my friend's bed and not mine; and another day where we didn't get enough towels and just wanted one extra hand towel, but of course that took an hour and going through guest services and three different people handing us five full sets of towels.\nI'd say the only saving grace this hotel seems to have are their staff who service the bar/lounge, and the marketplace/gift shop. The restaurant manager and food and beverage manager both were also very pleasant, though the service at their restaurant is terrible (waited over an hour to be served, and another forty-five minutes for our bill, to which we immediately sought out a manager because our waitress had gone AWOL). Upper management and the front desk staff, as well as housekeeping, seem to not have a damn clue what they're doing as they're so disorganized and there are more miscommunications than I can count. Some of them are also not necessarily nice people to interact with, which is unfortunate because I believe the customer is always right, and we'd handled everything that came at us with poise and professionalism up until we checked out.",

Everything from the steak to the side dishes were off and the food did not live up to all of the restaurant's legacy and hype. After today, I will never be going back here again. \n\nI may as well go buy some prime steaks or filets at the market on my own and make my own dish. I would never ever recommend this place to any of my colleagues, friends or family. If you want a good steak, go to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse instead. \n\nWhen we told the waiter how disappointing and below average our food had been, the response from \"the back\" was that they weren't at their best tonight because there were too many people. Okay... so great! That meant that they knew the food was going to be shitty, but they still accepted customers anyways.... \n\nIn short, I do not appreciate this kind of laziness and irresponsibility when it comes to fine dining. I need my fine dining to be fine dining. There was no honesty to this type of response and food. This was not fine at all, folks. Not fine at all. Avoid.",

Being forewarned about the bad service from this website we called to try and secure a table or at least to find out the waiting time. On several calls we got no answer. Since it was close to home we went anyway. Several people were waiting outside. This was at around 9 pm and we were told they were not accepting anymore patrons. Seriously!! I explained the we tried to call in order to avoid wasting time, bus and cab fare back since it was late.  The hostess apologized and stated that the restaurant is really busy. I understand that, but what is unsettling is the patrons waiting outside also made several phone calls and when they finally did get through they were told that they don't accept reservations over the phone.  So which is it? Essence festival ended the day before and there are definitely LESS people in the city now. Clearly the management needs a class in restaurant/patron etiquette and I hope that considering its location it will be more appreciative of the community and provide a better level of class and service.",

  "text": "My wife and I went to Mr. B's Bistro on the third day of our anniversary trip to New Orleans.  The restaurant was suggested by our hotel's concierge. All other restaurants before this that were booked by the concierge were great. This one was the last restaurant and I had high confidence that it would be just as great as others.  Unfortunately, we had to end, what was to that point an unforgettable trip, with a dud, thanks to this venue.\n\nLet's start with Jazz.  We were sitting in the restaurant without any Jazz for an hour.  They were in some other parts of the restaurant.  When the band arrived it was a group that could not hold a candle to many performances on the streets of French Quarter.\n\nMoving on to the food. The appetizers in the range of very good to bad. The duck rolls were very good. The oysters were pretty good too.  Their gumbo was terrible.  We had gumbo the day before and Commander's Palace and those two can't be compared.\n\nFrom the main course, if you are not ordering their BBQ Shrimp, don't bother with anything else as you won't get it at all or it will arrive very late.  We had two tables around us that arrived after us.  They requested Shrimp and were done before our meals arrived.  I first ordered brisket with grits (Breakfast Bowl) and was informed later that they were out of it.  I ordered something else but 1.5 hours into sitting and waiting, our food never arrived. We were starting to run late to our flight and just ended up walking away.  No one really cared that we were leaving very unsatisfied. The manager talked to us and just shrugged.\n\nWith so many awesome dining options in NOLA, including Sunday Jazz brunches, I would stay away from this place.",

Boy is it gonna be another 14 years till I grace this restaurant with my presents... despite the numerous healthy food violations I witness well keep this short and sweet on the count of service and food. And when I mean service I'm referring to lack there of. Now after nearly a 20 minute wait on our simple ice teas which i could have walked to Circle K for faster, it took nearly 2x that for our food order. The food then came out faster then the drinks we ordered???. Lastly when it came to a refill of tea I would have had a better chance refilling it from behind the bar or hostess stand then at my table. The food was average nothing to go home to tell your auntie about and I could have found more flavor in a late night carne asada burrito from Los betos then this place... I'm just glad they had the Diamondbacks game on to distract me from what I was eating. I'll be sticking to my west side go tos from now on #MosaicCafe #1",

The last 3 times I have been there over the course of 5 weeks, no milk.  Why can't be solved?  I'm not a restaurant manager, but here's some ideas... 1.  Stock more milk.  2. Have the person that is holding the front door open for people walk across the parking lot to Costco or Target to buy some milk and then poor it into the kids cup you use for soda.  3. Offer to take $1 off the cost of the kids meal since you don't have the milk.  4.  Stop publishing on your kids menu you offer it, if you don't intend to have it.",

I spoke with Matt who indicated that they could have someone out the next day at 4pm.  I left the office early to ensure that I was home in time; they never showed.  At 8:15pm, I received a call from Bob(?) stating that they hadn't forgotten about me but that they were down a truck.  I replied, \"you were supposed to be here over 4hrs ago.\"  Why would he wait 4hrs to tell me he was down a truck?  Wasn't that known at 3:30pm?  No apologies, no attempt to waive the diagnostic fee, nothing...he quipped, \"when can we come out?\"  Ummm, it's July 4th weekend!!!! They threw a wrench in my plans to have my unit serviced, at the very least diagnosed, before the holiday.  He hurriedly scheduled me for the next business day.  Honestly, when people don't respect my time, I can't give them my money.  It seems that I avoided a headache & misfortune after reading these reviews.",

  "text": "I've been 3 times, so I think I can share a fair judgement.  This business is a lot of show, without the go.   Service has been the overall department that has been completely lacking along with some breakfast items are products of horrible cooking.  First time: asked for black coffee and a matcha latte, dad didn't get his coffee until our food already arrived (which also seemed to take forever) and I actually never received my matcha latte after asking and reminding waiters more than eight times, 8!!! It got to be comical, which is why we counted.  By the end of our breakfast they finally offered it to me in it as a to go drink and still had the audacity to charge me for it, so I said no.  Second visit, was dinner with friends, this was a much more pleasant experience, there was four of us, we shared a bottle of wine and I remember I liked my food. No complaints here. Third time, was another breakfast round... I'm not sure what it is about breakfast but I don't think they do a good job for breakfast. To start with, we were given menus for both breakfast and lunch, which was appreciated, but no drink menus and we were specifically interested in mimosas or Bloody Mary's etc. because we didn't know what to order, or what was our options were... my dad ordered a Bloody Mary, and I ordered a Mimosa. I only mention this because it was frustrating to see other people have different variations of mimosas and also bloody mary's, other breakfast cocktails which we didn't even know existed.  My dad ordered a ham and cheese omelette with his side of home fries. I ordered the power bowl muesli.  We got through two drinks before the food came, which actually was a long time. By the time our food came, the order was wrong - my dad had fruit, but no home fries as he requested.  We immediately let our server know, and she said she would go grab them.  Additionally, our plates were extremely bland.  Just an omelette, no garnish or sides at all (other than the fruit in the side bowl.  The plates just looked sad.  Also, I could tell by looking at the omelette it wasn't good, that's how bad it was, and my dad concurred.  The wait staff failed to bring his home fries in any kind of fast or quick manner, so we reminded our bartender, who then reminded to server, once my dad got a refill on his coffee we also then reminded that server as well.  We ate through the entire meal, never got the home fries, and in the end right as our check was being delivered we mentioned the homefries again, and that's when the bartender sent a server running for them, and as we were signing our check is when they came out and were offered as a \"to go\" option.  While a simple side, it was really disappointing to go the entire breakfast with an awkward feeling of  \"I guess they just don't care\" and instead of comping anything, the manager offered me a $15 off coupon the next time we came in.  It's just hard to ever want to come in again... and didn't feel like an adequate apology on a $45 breakfast.  And lastly my dads omelette tasted like McDonalds.  Only upside was that my muesli power bowl was delicious, just hard to believe it took as long as it did to come out or that anything cost as much as it did with as horrible of service and lack of \"care\" put behind anything that was done there.",

You definitely don't get any deals here unless you are a first time waxer.  You get a free one on your first visit so I threw in an armpit wax in with my full leg.  The lobby is really nice but the rooms do not match.  The esthetician did not leave the room when I got undressed which was weird.  They use a semi hard wax the entire time which makes the process WAY more painful than it needs to be (which is funny considering they advertise a pain free wax). She seemed to be rushing the rest of the time.     She also went very slow when removing the wax and pressed so hard into my upper boob area when waxing my armpits I got a small bruise.

The cake didn't fit in the box so we walked across town with an open box. \nWhen we open the Box it had our daughter's name on it however it looked like it was written by a first grader. None of the requested decorations including the Holy Cross and others were not included which was the purpose of the cake. The top it off the cake was  completely dry would have been better off with a cake from acme. The cake was loaded with these plastic sticks and I'm unsure why we counted over 40 of them, making it impossible to cut.

Girl ringing up my order seemed new, was running around attempting to make my coffee and asking the other barista (also at the counter) how to make the drinks we ordered AS HE CONTINUED TO MAKE HIS OWN DRINK AND TASTE TEST SYRUPS.  IT TOOK 15 minutes to make TWO DRINKS IN AN EMPTY SHOP.   The guy who sat there and stared at me as we waited never made one attempt to make my drink after I tipped 20% on the order.  Two coffees, $12.50 , 15 minute wait, empty shop.  Do the math.  This isn't the first time it has happened, staff is usually unfriendly.  I was coming in everyday and buying coffee but I got sick of spending my money with people who act like jerks.  I wrote an email to the shop and they never responded which is 100% proof they don't give a damn about bad service.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE COFFEE SHOPS I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE.",

The only logical explanation is this is a coke from a customer that left and they folded their receipt and tossed it in their drink. Do Hooters re use their cups without washing it or tossing whatever was in it? I brought this up to our server \"savannah\" and she played it off!

  "text": "Long time regular of Hooters in the Florida and now defunct Ohio areas and had to visit this one when visiting friends in Arizona.   Ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told I cannot have one alone.  That's ok   I remember living in Ohio the Hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some Tampa stores   AFTER THIS ALL DOWNHILL.   Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE,   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce, and  then mr \"know it all\" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.  Beautiful store just try not to engage manager  #WillRegret",

  "text": "I've been eating here when I'm in town for about 5 years and this place used to be great. The food has severely gone downhill in not only quality of ingredients but also in ability to prepare a dish. I ate here for lunch today, saying that so hopefully a member of the staff reads this and remembers me, I ordered the dry hot pot and my gf ordered fried dumplings and the cold noodles with chili oil and we shared each other's food. The mushrooms in my dish were impossible to cut even with a knife and the rest of the vegetables had a freeze dried feel to them being the consistency of bark. The pork was a bit rubbery and only had flavor from the oil draped over everything that seemed under seasoned as well and definitely tasted old. This was labeled in the menu as a 10/10 spicy rating, it was at most a 2. I didn't bother saying anything because of how rude the waiter/host was, but I'll get to that. The rice was cold and clumped together in chunks that led me to understand that it was previously microwaved. The dumplings looked ok, but the dough was undercooked and the sauce was just soy sauce that had no care whatsoever put into it. Her noodles were very bland and whoever prepared them obviously doesn't care about their food. The noodles had the same flavor deprived oil from my dish in it, just disappointing really. This type of food is supposed to be robust and I've eaten at a ton of places across the country and internationally that do care about what the put out. This place doesn't care anymore. The man that seated us was incredibly rude the entire time. He huffed and puffed and stomped his feet when I asked for the real Chinese menu instead of the Americanized Chinese menu. And, they used to throw shade if you asked for the Americanized menu, now it's the opposite. After we were done we both had a decent amount of food left and I decided to take it to feed to the raccoons that come around my house. They look cool and I like to feed them. Anyway, the take out container was dirty from previous food in it! I was blown away, especially when I pointed it out and the rude person pretending to be a man grabbed it out of my hand and stormed, literally stormed off before I was even half way through my sentence. I was calm the whole time, not sure what this guys deal is. Then came back with the same container that he washed! He washed the dirty container that should never have been used in the first place and thought that was acceptable. I will never go here again and I hope they go out of business so no one has to be punished by this Handy Nasty food. Disgusting food and disgusting people, except for the one guy who worked there who said goodbye to us. He seemed mortified because he knew what the cuck host just did to everyone in the dining area throughout the day and I assume throughout his life. I hate this place, and I can only hate it because I used to love it.",

Both the staff and owner are unprofessional and offer subpar work. They subcontract their jobs and don't have a foreman or supervisor present for the day of the job to assist in communication with us. All the workers just stand there and stare at you when you are asking any questions about installation and then tell you to call the office to speak to someone else! It was, honestly, amazingly unorganized. Very disappointed with the quality of the product, the warranty and the treatment by the owner and staff. Furniture was damaged and broken the day of the installation and never repaired.  Baseboards were not installed even though they were included in the price quote. Now less than a year later we are forced to replace the floors. Tried to follow up and resolve this directly and all they do is make excuses and lie.

We looked at the time and it was 10:30 ON THE NOSE. Since breakfast was what we came for, we left. It doesn't seem like they should have had to be so steadfast about their cutoff time.

Thinking I'm at an Italian place, I should have left running when I'm presented with a 6 page menu, one full page devoted to BBQ, fajitas is one of their highlighted items... the menu goes all over the place, and apparently, not in a good way. \n\nI guess they're catering to tourists who might have a wide variety of tastes and no expectation that their diners will ever come back, so why try.\n\nI ordered the Riesling Chicken on the servers recommendation.  Side Salad with  home made dressing, and the side picked was the \"potato casserole\"... \n\nSalad - the star of the show - (which didn't take a lot to achieve).  Dressing good, fresh ingredients.  Ok, now for the chicken!\n\nWell... Lots of creamy sauce - kind of \"sweet\" in a way - but not much to my taste.  I guess that's my issue for ordering it.  The breast was cooked a little crispy - had to use my knife to cut.  Really???!!!  The side I chose was a bad decision.  A bowl with what appeared to be frozen type shredded hash browns, with a little melted cheese on top.  Couldn't have sat under the warmer for long - it was too cool to the touch to have been there.  Sent it back and mashed potatoes and gravy were substituted in.  Typical add water and stir consistency with a small plastic cup side of gravy that had an off taste - perhaps cloves?  not sure - but not appetizing at all. \n\nIf I come back, we'll find somewhere else to go.",

My friend who used to work at a country club didn't even bother to explain to her what is actual serving. By this time, I was truly regretful for tipping at all.

I probably waited a good couple minutes before being greeted. The guy didn't give me my discount after I told him I was a partner.... luckily I mobile ordered my other drinks.

My husband spent A LOT of money on an Imagine Dragons VIP package and it left much to be desired. The \"gift bag\" was filled with a small, cheap crumpled poster, plastic sunglasses, a pop socket, and a phone charger fit for a circa 2015 android. The \"crowd free shopping\" consisted of about 200 people crammed in a small area with general admission goers, and the \"hassle free entry\" took 45 minute. So, all in all I sit here really pissed about the experience, feeling bad for my husband who wanted to surprise, and the concert hasn't even started yet. Bravo CID. Thank you for seriously putting a damper on my night.",

I then end pulling up to a long line at checkout, max ever 2 checkers, I am then asked to self-check.

There was no trash can anywhere available for customers dispose of the food/trash and staff never came out to clear and clean the tables. The restaurant was filled with flies and nats .

I'm certainly not an expert on southern food, but I definitely know good food from bad food and southern food aside, this place just didn't meet my expectations or standards. I'm baffled as to how they have received such good reviews. \n\nThings started off poorly when we were seated without menus, silverware, or waters. My friend and I tried to order a glass of wine. They were out of every wine by the glass (except white zinfandel and I'm not really sure who actually drinks that anymore), so we were forced to order a bottle of white wine. The wine bottle shows up to our table and is warm. The waiter apologizes for the warm wine, but proceeds to tell us that all the cold bottles are already open. We're confused, because they previously told us we had to order the entire bottle and couldn't buy the wine by the glass. So which is it? \n\nOur food arrives and everything but the fried catfish is cold. Like it just came out of the refrigerator cold. The fish was over battered and my friend's fish batter had a piece of okra in it. Huh? The corn bread was so dry and stale. And then to top it off, mid-dinner the staff starts mopping the floors and cleaning the restaurant with pungent smelling chemicals, which I could  taste in my mouth as I inhaled the toxins while eating.\n\nIt was a huge disappointed overall and a total waste of a dinner out.

  "text": "$50 for an incredibly average meal and two beers. Actually, it wasn't good enough to be average. I got the 16 ounce ribeye with a baked potato and applesauce. \n\nThe steak was thin and fairly bland. I got it smothered with onions, sautéed mushrooms and cheese. I assumed the cheese would be crumbled, like blue cheese is in most steak places, but it wasn't. It was basically thick liquid cheese poured over the steak. I would not recommend the cheese on the steak. Maybe I didn't pay close enough attention to the description of the toppings in the menu? The applesauce was out of a jar. The potato was what you'd expect. \n\nI sat at the bar. The girls working the bar were very friendly, but very busy (and very, very loud). They should have more help on a Friday night because I had to wait several minutes for my second beer and then again for my check. The manager was also behind the bar but she didn't seem to be motivated to do any actual work. \n\nIn future, I will cook my own steak (bought from Publix for about $15) and drink my own beer (6 for about $10) and spend half as much. \n\nI will not be going back.",

This spot is probably one of the most expensive Korean BBQ places around town.\n\n2. The side dishes were horrible. The kimchi was also not good. \n\n3. The meets had some flavor, but it feels like they don't marinate \n\nThe reason I couldn't give this place 1 star is because of their service. They were very informative.",

  "text": "First of all, this fingerprint service is actually embedded within an insurance agency.  I understand that the fingerprinting business is a side gig, and that it has unexpectedly caused this agency frustration and been detrimental to their ability to conduct business.  However, this is a terrible place to get fingerprinting done.  The employees are rude and treat us as a nuisance, even commenting that our fingerprinting is interfering with their insurance business.  All of us waiting were professionals in the field of psychology, education, and even coaching, and did not expect to be treated so rudely.  In fact, the Identogo website lists this location as a service provider but does not give any indication that it is located inside of another business.  The office environment itself was dark and dirty, and the employees rude and discourteous to each other and the fingerprinting customers.  They do not greet you, and have posted the sign below indicating that walk-ins will only be serviced in the afternoon.  This differs from the Identogo website information, which clearly lists 9:00 am - 11:00 am as walk in hours.  Bottom line - this agency took a contract to provide fingerprint services, now is wishing they did not have this hassle, and will take it out on you if you go there.",

Being from New Jersey and being a chef I have had great Italian food in NY, NJ, and many other states. This was very poor quality Italian...the red sauce had no flavor and tasted like they just opened a can of sauce.  The cheese was a cheap mozzarella also with no flavor.  The menu was very limited and it was hard to order anything because everything sounded so basic.  I had the chicken parm,  the serving size was small, it was overpriced, it didn't come with any pasta under it or on the side...just chicken on plate.  Very poor presentation as well.  I had a side salad with the meal and McDonald's makes a better salad than his place.  If you want good Italian food...don't go here:",

We were one of 3 tables in the place, and the tall female server was short with everyone, had a bad attitude when a few members of our party were being friendly, and just seemed miserable. I'll spare the details, but we all agreed we'd never be back again. One of the 6 of us owns 6 restaurants, and he was saying it's just shocking how many bad restaurants - like this one - come and go in his business. The location is the only Hail Mary for this place he was saying, as the one time tourist business is their only hope, since the pizza was sub par also, and none of us will be back. A couple with a young child actually got up and left after an initial interaction with our same rude waitress. Not sure what was said, but that's just award level bad business practice. Summary: Not good pizza, Rude Service, and overpriced. I never thought I'd ever recommend Hooters in my life, but it's next door, and any place that serves food and drinks would be a better experience than this place. Trust me. EDIT: I had to come back and point out to look at the 36 yelp reviews that are not recommended (for some reason - or owner antics?) THEY ARE ALL 1 STAR about \"unbelievably rude service\" and bad pizza. Check them out and avoid this place. Kicking a mother and her children out while her husband picks up food. As a kind business owner in Tampa, who loves this city and the people, go back to NY with your garbage pizza and rudeness. At least get a clue Precinct. My Lord.",

They gave away my place before the 30-minute window that I had to get in. It only took me 20 minutes to get there. When I voiced my concern to the girl, she told me that I would be next only for the next Barber to come out and call the other person. I was in a rush I tried using their system and it's so disorganized with no communication in a one-room building. How do you even manage that? You can't turn over your shoulder and say oh this was an issue by the way. I'm over this location. All I needed was a quick haircut. I guess it's going uncut another day and I will find a new Barber.",

  "text": "Not worth the wait... I've worked in several restaurants in touristy areas and believe me folks, it's hard to screw up breakfast in a place like this. They have a great view of the water.  It's a cozy \"feels local\" kind of place.  All they need to do is smile, be courteous, provide attentive service, and halfway decent breakfast food and it's a 5 star place. Unfortunately, our experience was lacking in all of the above.  I walked in to record my name, party and acceptable dining location. Done. Waited 20-25 minutes. No big deal. Was seated at the \"counter\" despite requesting to be seated at a table...wait, seriously? no backs on the stools, no counter service to speak of. We were essentially sitting at the server bus station surrounded by bins of creamers,butter, cartons of juice, extra ramikens.... After another 10 minutes, a server reluctantly asked us for our order... as we were listening to the wait staff be \"cut\" since there were open tables - why are we stuck here?  Another 15 minutes and our \"food\" arrived. Powdered eggs, store-bought bread, canned OJ, undercooked eggs, cold food, congealed cheese, plastic plates, plastic condiments... it was only edible to my 9 year old son.  There is a Dunkin Donuts in the same strip mall. Grab an egg and cheese bagel and pull up a chair along the water - trust me, it will be a better experience.  Hope the food and service was just a one-off today... if not, your regulars must not have any taste buds or self respect left... good luck.   I have pictures to back this up - just haven't figured out how to add to this post!!",

Although the fish was pretty much spot on, the sides were Very Poor. Cajun seasoned corn on the cob seemed as though it was sitting in a luke warm pan of water for a while. No freshness what so ever. Off the plate it was room temperature and had no flavor. The Cajun fried potatoes (too many), were also of poor quality. As though they had been sitting for a good while under a weak heat lamp. Off the plate, again had cooled to almost room temperature. Now these folks are pricing these plates above twenty dollars, and the quality just isn't there. All three of these items could have been cooked at the same time. I'll pay the money, but I want the quality it commands. You can't be charging restaurant prices inside a bar. Nice wait staff. Confined restroom. This place is a prime candidate for one of those shows where Robert Irvine comes in and does a menu and interior overhaul. No. I will not be back.",

As I was walking out this guy started laughing and saying can you believe that lady? She thought we were open and laughed. So I tried to get back in and the door was locked so I told the guy from the open window that I heard what he said and i thought it was rude! His reply was I couldn't believe you thought we were open, the chairs were on the table and the door was locked. I replied by saying that I walked right in and I had never been here before, there were customers eating also. Anyway he follows me out and says what is your problem. He never apologized or anything. I will never try to eat here again and let everyone know how rude they are!! There are many nice places to eat on the pier! So whatever you do don't eat there!!!",

When the hostess seated us she cleared the table but never came back to wipe it. There were no place settings and no dishes. Even though they were not busy everything took forever. When the crab bisque came out it was lukewarm as was the char broiled oysters. The oysters were seasoned with  way to much salt. We ordered bruschetta six oysters 2 cups of bisque and a beer.

We again are boycotting this place and will probably not be returning..Our server was Monica and she did a good job.... Your cooks need to read before they just assumed we wanted raw burgers.........................",

The employee DID NOT GREET my husband and I, as if we interrupted his time from his phone. I had asked a question and he replied with a attitude as if I was annoying him. I asked because it was my first time having Thai style ice cream. Then as he handed me my ice cream I said thank you, he didn't reply or even looked up at me. So RUDE, I def regret tipping him. Will NEVER return to establishment. What sucked was we don't even live in Philly but still went since I was craving for Thai style ice cream.",

  "text": "I know, what should I expect from a rundown Burger King at 8th & Market? But today's experience was really beyond pathetic. \n\nI waited for 20 minutes this morning for my simple order of 2 breakfast sandwiches and hash browns. The workers showed no interest at all in helping customers or making food. The cashier took an order, then slouched off to do something in the back, no apologies. The line extended to the door. \n\nI could see in the kitchen they were slowly cooking a couple items, and frying a small basket of hash browns. With the number of people in line they should have had a double order of everything on the grill and been hustling to get it all done. \n\nIt took 10 minutes just to get to the cashier and place my order. Then I stood against a wall and waited another 10. I watched 6 people who were behind me in line get their food first. When I finally asked if they'd skipped me they said \"no your order is almost ready.\" But there was no reason mine should have taken longer. They were just apathetic, half asleep and verging on mean with their annoyance at customers who didn't come when their number was called. \n\nAfter all that, the sandwiches were sloppily put together, egg hanging out the sides, and wrapped with the inside of the wrapper on the outside. \n\nSo if by posting this I can get even ONE person to avoid this place, I will feel I've done my job.",

The young lady bartending clearly saw us sit down at one of the side tables by the bar by the front window but for some reason choose to never speak or acknowledge us while we were there. I had to use the restroom while my girlfriend waited to order drinks and by the time I came out, at least 10 minutes while waiting to use restroom, she still had not been greeted or asked for an order. If we were suppose to order drinks at the bar and go back to our seats that is perfectly fine but the bartender could have at least informed us of that while we waited. I have been in the Restaurant Industry for over 15 yrs and I have never treated any guest with such a lack of hospitality. As new residents in the area, I can promise you we will not be back and we will not be recommending your establishment to anyone.",

My husband and  I just got off the phone with the front desk after a weeks stay at this hotel to talk to them about why they took $1700 out of our account when they were only supposed to take 700. The woman I spoke to on the phone was extremely rude to me would not let me finish what I was trying to explain to her. All of her responses seem like she had a big attitude over me asking the littlest of questions just trying to figure out what was going on with their establishment and our bank account. Come to also find out that we were charged over $50 for \" mini bar use\" when my husband and I did not even touch the small refrigerator located under the TV the entire stay. I was hoping to write a good review about our stay here but this absolutely ruined any good remarks that I had on this hotel. We have yet to receive our \"incidental \"money back when the lady insisted that it was already in our account. Absolutely terrible customer service. Would never recommend.",

I've never had a fruity Chili Rellenos, but this one was filled with raisins and pine nuts with very little spice or sauces such as Chili Verde or Rojo.  \n\nMy opinion, being raised in New Mexico, and extensively traveling Mexico and Spain was that this was an artsy attempt to upsell Mexican cuisine.   \n\nI heard reactions to the enchilada meal as being very coconut heavy in flavor, and even a Taco Bell Reference.  \n\nIf you wanted more authentic Mexican food I'd direct you to the closest Applebee's, Chipotle, Taco Bell...and that's not Mexican food as well.",

  "text": "DUNEDIN BAGELS & DELI\nI picked up bagels here EVERY week & loved them! My very first job, at 15, was at a bagel shop in NJ with New York owners, Norman & Miriam Fleischman. I know a great water bagel when I taste one. However, I bought a half dozen cinnamon raisin bagels that tasted like onion. The first one tasted like onion. I thought that it, perhaps, came in contact with an onion bagel; no problem. The 2nd one tasted like onion & I thought then that they didn't properly clean their oven. After tasting the 3rd bagel, I called them to ask for 6 more. Well, the owner was angry & inappropriate. He sniffed each of the 3 bagels that I returned & said, \"they don't smell like onion!\" (Accusing me of lying?! Really?!?!) I would have simply apologized & replaced the 6 bagels...that simple. He said, \"you take bite, you taste onion, you bring back!\" I tried to explain that I thought it might have just been the one bagel. He got angrier & forcefully threw the remaining bagels in the trash before handing me a new bag of 6. Well, he lost a loyal customer for nothing!!!!!!! BEWARE; do not cross the boss!!!!!",

  "text": "Frankly, I don't understand how anyone has had a good experience at Heffe.  The staff was inattentive and unfriendly right off the bat.  That being said,  places can have bad service and still have good food, and we had been interested in stopping by the Fishtown location for some time, so we figured we'd give them a shot anyway.  I ordered the Almost Pastor tacos, my friend ordered the Fat Man burrito, and we got the poutine to share.  The tacos were bland and boring.  The pineapple was less than fresh, the pork was tough, and it seems they completely forgot any seasoning whatsoever.  I took a couple bites and just didn't feel like it was worth the calories, so I gave up.\n\nThe burrito was sizeable, so my friend suggested we just share that instead.  The burrito and poutine however, were completely the opposite.  There was plenty of flavor, and would be great if your preferred flavor is salt, and only salt.  The poutine was so salty that the other flavors didn't come through at all.  I think my blood pressure went up 20 points by the first bite.  The Fat Man burrito was just totally inedible.  Unless you happen to be a horse, or some other animal that enjoys a salt lick.  It was seriously gross.  After a couple bites, we actually decided to toss all the food and went next door to Stockyard to split a sandwich instead.  We didn't see the point in complaining since the staff was less than cordial from the beginning.   \n\nI was hoping that maybe it was just an \"off\" night - it would be really cool to have a decent taco place in this neighborhood.  Unfortunately, based on the other negative reviews and how truly terrible our experience was, it's just not worth another try.  The tacos really do suck, and so did everything else about our experience.",

On my honeymoon a little side diamond fell out so I researched places to take my ring for a small repair and saw good reviews on here and decided to go with them as they have in house repairs. Unfortunately this was a mistake. \nFrom the moment I walked in they were nice, yet their work does not match their attitudes. As I explained to the lady my issue she tried to sell me on her insurance when I was telling her that I already had my own and I am here to repair it, not buy new insurance. \nThen, she gave me a week and a half time frame for the repair but said it would really only take a few days. Two weeks went by and I had still heard nothing so I went in to pick it up hoping it would be ready, they just forgot to call, but no, they had not even STARTED!!! The next day it was finally ready (after I complained) and they did a horrible job. The diamond they replaced is of far less quality, they 'squished' it in place and ruined the prongs holding it. They also rhodium plated it for me, however my ring is two tone and they covered the yellow gold in white gold when doing it... Just really upsetting. Luckily I have a jeweler back home I will be seeing over the holiday's that I will have fix what they did.. \nLastly, I called to let them know I was unhappy with their work and Will was not very helpful and almost did not even care. \nThey may be great when you're buying something that makes them a lot of money, but NOT when its a small repair. They put it on the back burner until they have time. Very sad.",

The host took about 15 minutes to seat 3 tables before us due to him scouting which tables were clean. After being seated, we were not given a drink menu and after 10 minutes of waiting for a server, I decided to run to the restroom. I overheard the host talking to a server about how he sat her section and she had no idea that had happened. I returned to the table 2 minutes later, the server dropped off a drink menu finally. We order our drinks and food at the same time, after 10 more minutes we finally received our margaritas. So after being there almost 40 minutes, we got our drinks in a restaurant with only 1/4th of the tables taken. I open my silverware and find cheese stuck to the knife, told the waitress and she replaced them with another knife covered in cheese. It took 4 tries to get some decent silverware. The waitress then brought out our food, she apparently heard chicken fajitas when I definitely ordered steak fajitas. So I waited 25 more minutes for my correct order to come out while my SO was basically done her food. The fajita was good, the drinks were good, but the service was god awful. I'd be embarrassed if I worked there today, I won't be going back for awhile.",

  "text": "The saddest part of this review is that I used to like Axis and frequent it all of the time but my last experience was telling. In ordering a chicken finger platter, I asked for a side caesar salad along with BBQ sauce and honey mustard for the fingers. When I get back to my office and open my meal, I find that instead of the salad, I received chicken noodle soup and instead of BBQ sauce, I received maple syrup. What's even more annoying is that I paid extra for the BBQ sauce. When I call them and tell them of their mistakes, they only offer to remake the salad. I still had to travel back to the restaurant and exchange my food myself with no reimbursement for my time and inconvenience. Axis, do better.",

However, I feel this Texas Roadhouse stands by itself as the worst service restaurants in the chain. I live very close to this restaurant, but will go to Greenwood location instead of going here.  The workers at the Avon location are constantly messing up the food orders. The managers will give some shortsighted excuses without any apologies and/or compensation. I will never be back.",

  "text": "I am really surprised with all these great Yelp reviews. This place is mediocre at best. And way too overpriced!!\nGood concept, really nice space and ambiance but very poor execution. \nFirst the food. It is definitely overpriced. We went twice for breakfast. \nOatmeal they serve is Trader Joe's organic quick cook oatmeal in packets. They just add hot water and a few slices of bananas. Twice I was told \"sorry we ran out of steel cut oats\". \nThe silver dollar pancakes and scrambled eggs are just ok, wouldn't come back for that either. \nThey had some oatmeal chocolate chip cookies which were really good but again overpriced. \nCoffee was ok, nothing special but I have to say that they do serve organic half and half and organic almond milk. \nView is great, nice outdoor seating and very pleasant space inside. But... service is terrible. They seem like they have no idea what they're doing. Everyone is doing everything-from taking orders to cooking to serving. It seemed very chaotic. I waited the other morning for 15 mins just to order-even though I was first in line because the guy was making smoothies and explained the older lady what she should be doing. She was munching on the dates while making smoothies, not wearing gloves and one of the guys who was supposed to do all the cooking (I guess) was taking orders using the same glove for handling credit cards that he uses for preparing food...The two guys also seemed a bit annoyed and unpleasant-probably because they cannot handle that many customers... \nAll in all-menu looks interesting and different but the food my group had was just ok. Won't be coming back. Please do something about the service!!",

  "text": "Really disappointed with my experience this time around. We ended up being there for about 2 hours and not by choice. While they were busy it didn't help that I could see our server shooting the breeze at the bar. I am familiar with the style of the restaurant but was aggravated by how long it took everyone to receive their food at our table. The butternut squash was amazing as always but my main dish literally tasted like gruel. We saw our actual server maybe 3 times during the entire visit. When we received our main dishes it took about 5 minutes before we could flag down someone to give us forks so we could actually eat our food. When we were brought the utensils the server made a rude comment. We finished our food and patiently waited for the server to come and check on us and give us the check. Since we weren't asked if there were going to be separate checks at the beginning of the meal we asked if it was possible to split the check. (On a side note we have had our check split before there). Our server said I can only split it evenly as many times as you want. He repeated it again and this time he was more rude. I understand that this place is busy and popular but the service has totally ruined the place for me. It's a shame that they care more about being cool and hip over treating customers kindly.",

  "text": "My family and I took my mom here for her 61st birthday. It was her first time experiencing the habachi grill. Our chef was amazing and the food was delicious, which Is why this review even got 1 star, but our server was the absolute worst. We were a party of 12 and when we were seated the table did not have enough dishes or menus. Our server was very rude when we requested more. My aunt has a mushroom and shrimp food allergy but the server proceeded to give her a soup full of mushroom flakes anyway. Once the chef began preparing our food, we did not see our server again... she didn't stop by to check on our needs and even the chef was looking around for her. All of our cups were empty and in need of a refill, so I had to get up from my seat and search around for our waiter to inform her that we needed refills. She exclaimed that she had other tables to tend to... which is fine but she never returned to check on us. I'm not sure if her customer service skills sucked because she knew gratuity was included regardless if she works or not, but thanks to her we will choose a different habachi restaurant in the future. Oh, and to put the cherry on top, my husband wanted a to-go water, since we had a 1 hour drive home, and of course our server was absent after we paid, so I proceeded to ask another server near the sushi bar, and he and his coworkers laughed right in my face and told me to ask my server... at this moment I was disgusted knowing I gave these people our hard earned money.

I do not participate in their $40 Buffet because I cannot eat $40 worth of food. And of course you cannot take it home with you. So I normally go in and order Seafood by the pound and take some home and make other meals from it. Last Friday I went, and it is busy because of Lent. However I  did not mind the  40-minute wait, Until they seated us and told us we could not order crawfish by the pound. They had a sign on the wall that stated how much crawfish was by the pound. Do you think they could have told us they were not selling it by the pound. Well if you think you're going to bamboozle me into a $40 Buffet you have another thought coming. I went to Perino's their crawfish is much better anyway tho it does cost more.  I will likely never go back to Zydeco's. I just think that was extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate, and rude",

So I placed my order online, payment took off my card, once I got in my car and was on my way I received a call from the pizza hut stating We can complete your order because we don't have any product, when I was trying to explain my frustration the unprofessional young lady hung up the phone on me. Avoid this location if possible. The food is subpar and the service is very poor. Hope the owner or manager read these bad review and re-vamp his/her team, or the owner re-vamp the whole staff.",

We told the manager and they spent some time figuring out what to do before moving the couple. They ended up moving the couple and having a waiter grab the cockroach with a napkin and throw it away. It really freaked us out and made us question about the cleanliness of the place. Next we ordered the royal street salad and mr b's salad with chicken. The salads were decent, but we had to send two back to get them to remake the salad and add bacon/blue cheese to them. The other girls ordered seafood gumbo and pastrami sandwich. They were disappointed with their meals. The service was just okay. In addition when we got our check it was wrong and we had to send it back. FYI to add a 3oz grilled chicken breast it cost an additional 7 bucks. Overall I would not come back here. It doesn't live up to all the great reviews.",

  "text": "So, this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I wanted to try it since they finally have a franchise in the metro area. I have to say that I was truly disappointed. I don't normally do any reviews less than 4 stars, but unfortunately.....\nFirst, I have to say the customer service was amazing! I felt it was the behind the scene area that greatly affected our meal. I save this restaurant for this occasion alone. Only because we've eaten at other franchises across the board and it was our favorite. The crab cakes were cool when brought out, but it was reissued and removed from our check. It was okay. The manager Soliel came to check up on us and he's was great!\n\nThe steaks were mediocre and that was to say the least. I've never had to add salt to a steak and it was the first time it was not hot. The sides were okay but not up to par. \n\nOur waiter Alex was phenomenal at trying to please us. He made sure we had everything that we needed. It was the kitchen that may have slipped tonight. Not sure if I will be back for a special occasion, but maybe just to pass through.",

One wearing a pink camo ballcap admitted they turn off the ringer, a bad habit of theirs,hmmm. I placed my order and she casually walked to the break area told the cook. He comes out looking like he just crawled out of bed or something. My wife said she could see his bloodshot eyes from the car! As he moved around like a snail, while the other waitress made coffee chopping on her gum acting suspicious about something. Turning off the ringer to their phones must be common practice for the area. I tried calling the Lebanon Waffle House on 109 at the same time couldn't get an answer there either! People that do take out I would guess have somewhere to be, I do!! I wonder what their headquarters would think about that?",

  "text": "My daughters and I did the jazz dinner cruise last night. The cruise itself was nice and informative. We learned some very interesting things about New Orleans such as it is six to eight feet below sea level! We were informed that this is the reason for the above ground cemeteries because if you dig down six feet, you'll hit water! So interesting! \n\nThe staff was very friendly! The lady who led us to our table from Gray Line was very upbeat and enthusiastic! I wish I could remember her name. Jamie, our waitress was also very nice. \n\nThe cruise itself was $48, with dinner,  $83 per adult. There was salad with a vinaigrette dressing already on the table, which was pretty tasty. The food was available buffet style. I chose the green beans almondine, creamed spinach, cajun pasta, prime rib, roasted pork loin, and chicken gumbo. \n\nThe reason for the two stars is the food. I was surprised at the poor quality. The green beans were tough and borderline stringy. The creamed spinach and the cajun pasta were bland. I'm wondering if they were from a can. The prime rib had a lot of gristle and the roasted pork loin was very dry. The chicken gumbo was unremarkable, to say the least. As for dessert, the bread pudding was inedible. Aside from the salad, the bananas foster was the only thing I enjoyed. \n\nAs much as I don't want to tell you what I was thinking about the food, I must because if you're like me, you depend upon Yelp to help with your choices. That said, the food reminded me of what would be served in a nursing home for a holiday meal.......no kidding. \n\nI wouldn't advise bringing children on this cruise as it was crowded and the rails are a bit lower than what I'm used to. My grandchildren are well behaved and I wouldn't bring them. \n\nI would highly recommend the cruise itself for the information, sightseeing, and live entertainment. Do yourself a favor, save yourself $35 and eat before you get on the cruise.",

  "text": "This is the worst eye doctor's office I have ever been too. I ordered glasses a month and a half ago now and they have still yet to come in due to clerical errors on their part. They were supposed to be here in 7-10 business days. It has been 22 business days and still counting. \n\n  I called after 10 days only to find out that they had never even placed the order for the glasses I picked out. Apparently they had ordered contact lenses for me instead.  Very confused about that since I handed them the frames for the glasses and paid for them, so I have no idea how they would order a box of contacts from that interaction.  On top of that, they told me they wouldn't have placed my order until January 1, 2020 due to insurance guidelines (this ended up being their mistake, they could order them!  The insurance company was so confused when I called them about this!).  It would've been really great to know that they didn't plan on placing my order for an entire 18 months after I paid for them.  After getting that sorted out, 10 days later, they called to tell me the glasses finally arrived. I went to pick them up to only find out they messed up the lenses. So now I am waiting. AGAIN. \n\n  I wouldn't mind the problem with the glasses so much if they were the least bit professional there. Every time I called the office to inquire about my glasses, they told me they would call back later that day. Well, I would wait an entire 24 hours and would not hear back, so I would have to reach out to them again. If you are going to promise a patient you will call them back, then you have to actually call them back! \n\n  I truly cannot express how much you should not go here. I've been wearing glasses for 25 years now and have never encountered a worse office.",

One of the things we love about Tailgate is the personable service. The bar service was equal to going to broadway- order, get the drink, and they walk away after you get it. I'm not expecting a full conversation but some interaction would be nice- especially since it's a new location. \"Hey, how are y'all? Have you been to Tailgate before? Would you like to sample anything? This is what we have new, you should try it?\" BASIC restaurant conversation- we got none. I would have asked for a new beer if it didn't take having to reach over the counter just to flag down the bartender in order to order our pizza (for which we got charged $1.99 for swapping a meat- that we do at other locations with no charge). Pizza was lacking toppings too. I would suggest y'all get on the same page for every location. I don't mind paying extra for ranch when it's homemade (like other locations) but not a fan when it's from a jar. We just hurried up and left to go elsewhere.

Once seated our waitress made note of our lengthy wait and apologized but it still took another 10 minutes to even fill out water glasses! No sort of compensation was offered for our delayed seating. Unfortunately, the service tanked even further from there. The few times our table was even checked on they didn't stay around long enough to allow us to get a word in, or to ask for basic service such as refills in our empty water glasses. \n\nThe food was as ordered, but hardly seemed worth the bother or the price. Two hours later we finally concluded our underwhelming brunch experience.",

  "text": "We made a reservation in October, for this trip now in April. The reservation was made for TWO double beds. In addition, knowing that we were arriving late, the room was fully paid for to secure the requested room, and a follow up phone call was made two weeks prior this trip.\n\nUpon arrival, there was only one full bed. Due to the late arrival, they were unable to accommodate any room switch. When calling in the morning, I was told that people still needed to check in and they would see what they could do. Considering the fact that we were here for a rather large conference, I knew the chances of obtaining a room as the day went on. Further more, I do not understand why they \"needed to see who else needed to check in\" when our room was reserved and fully paid for. \n\nThis room also is a handicap accessible room, which means that there are shower accommodations, and there is a handheld shower head. When the shower head is on the stand, it shoots right at the wall which makes it difficult to just shower. \n\n\nI know that Loews has a great reputation, but this visit is very disappointing and just unacceptable. Clearly, despite having reservations, they blatantly do not have any care for their paying customers. \n\nP.S. Thanks for the roll-away bed, it is awesome (read sarcasm)",

We had the cheese curds as an appetizer and the Deep dish Capone for our meal. The curds were very good but the pizza wasn't knock-your-socks-off like I was hoping. The crust and cheese were good but the copious amounts of sauce and scant toppings left much to be desired. The flavor just wasn't there in the sauce and what little toppings were present were very over powered by the tangy sauce. If I lived closer, I might would give it another try but we're about 40 minutes out so it's highly unlikely. Maybe requesting light sauce would be a good idea. I love deep dish pizza and get it for several meals on every trip to Chicago. Unfortunately, this experience wasn't the local fix that I was hoping it would be.",

First off, when I walked in I stood at the counter, without being acknowledged, long enough to fully read the menus. After I ordered to go, a couple walked in, who also waited to be seated and no one acknowledged them either so they seated themselves. Lynsey, waitress, walks up from the back and says to the couple... \"you were supposed to wait to be seated, but what ever sit where you want\" in a very nasty rude tone. They wouldn't of had to seat themselves if someone had been at the front to welcome us into their empty restaurant at 2:45pm on Sunday June 10th. I ordered the hummus trio and received trio soup.

  "text": "Was in Nashville this past weekend with some friends. Decided to try this place as it was close to where we were staying. \n\nThe place is very quaint on the inside. Dark lighting, the type of spot that could suffice a first date, a work event or a family get together. My friend and I showed up around 3pm and strangely there was a ten minute wait (Which is weird, because it's that awkward time in between lunch and dinner, but whatever.) \n\nOur server is super friendly and attentive. I order the pan seared tuna with a side of the sweet potato fries with jalapeno ketchup. My friend orders the tavern burger. \n\nOur food comes. I take a bite of my tuna and it appears raw, almost entirely uncooked. I try again and can't bare it. The waiter has no problem swapping my order for the salmon which is very kind of him. My friend appears to enjoy the burger. The fries are fine-- not seven dollar side worthy fine, but decent enough. The jalapeno ketchup tastes like regular ketchup. The salmon doesn't particularly taste like fish (almost like an overly marinated chicken, which wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't brought under the guise of fish) but I run through it because I'm starved. We pay and the meal for me was at its best below average. Especially for the cost. \n\nNaturally the evening/early morning hits and I've got all types of food poisoning and stomach bug type issues (diarrhea, nauseous, headache, puking.) This was Monday morning/ Sunday evening. It's now Thursday and I'm still ill. Not quite sure how these people are cleaning their meats, but I won't be back anytime soon. Nice, attentive staff and sweet vibe. Food was awful.",

I then ordered macaroni & cheese, and it was cold. I kindly told my server who was extremely attentive and great and he got it out of my way. He brought a new order of mac & cheese out, and it was the right temperature but there was shredded pork inside. I had one of my coworkers try it, and they confirmed it was salty pork. It smelled of pork. As a vegetarian, I quickly lost my appetite and had it returned. The manager came out and assured me I was wrong about the pork and that it was the rind on the gouda. The manager also told me they don't even have pork on the menu, but I looked and they had a crispy pork option as well as a charcuterie board. My coworker corrected him about telling me I was wrong, and the manager stuttered and said he checked with the chef and it wasn't pork. It looks to me like they reused a utensil to heat up my mac. I told him I didn't want anything else. Then, he brings out a salad from their other restaurant which completely confused me because I just finished eating a salad. I didn't touch it, and I was over the experience. I paid for my brussel sprout salad, tipped my server, and left for good.",

  "text": "This facility was the worst I have ever experienced. The hotel staff were lackadaisical & unconcerned. The property looked like it was out of a post-apocalyptic movie. All the rooms appeared to be unoccupied &/or ransacked. There were rooms that were tossed with multiple beds stacked in the window & others that appeared to not have been occupied in some time. There were bed frames leaned against walls, rooms with open doors (not occupied), debris everywhere & this place was super eerie. When I got to my room, I noticed a very stale smell. The room seemed less clean as much as it was straightened up. When I went into the bathroom, I realized that the bathroom light did not work. The furniture in the room was circa 1970. As I looked at the outdated room, I noticed something disgusting. The bed skirt was covered in mold (pic). I immediately asked for another room. The attendant did not apologize but did move me into another room. This room was on the back of the hotel and it looked abandoned (pic). There was debris all over and was untidy. The room was marginally better and since it was almost midnight...I reluctantly decided to stay. The facility felt unclean and grimy. I slept on he sheets from both beds because the sheets, pillows & towels appeared to be the only thing that was clean. The TV wasn't HD and the channels were basic. When I left I realized that the cars in the lot were for airport parking...not guests. I should have stayed at Motel 6. The sign says it all (pic).",

I do want to point out the service was great!   I'll return to a restaurant if the food is great and the service isn't.  I'm not about to return after bad food for good service though.

I tell my ex to stop taking her here because it's terrible but they were at the mall and I guess they decided to do something spontaneous. My daughter had her hair cut at the salon by Kim. She asked for a pixie hair cut and highlights. For the record, My daughter is beautiful, but this haircut is awful. Seriously? A pixie hair cut is supposed to be very short, search it,  but this? It's long in some spots, and feathered in the bangs- we have no idea how to style this mop it's really sad. My daughter was in tears today trying to fix your terrible botch job... and where are the highlights? I let her stay home so we can get it fixed. Her whole head is brown there are no highlights at ALL, what a rip off, if I had been there you would have never got away with charging them but alas her dad was there and is too nice to offend or shall I say be honest. Please Go back to school and learn how to cut and highlight hair before you mess up any more. You did a bad job with it. Thank the Lord you didn't cut it too short like a real pixie cut cause now I have to pay another stylist to fix your botched job!! I will not come back. Also the couple times I was there, your attitudes could be a little friendlier, very sour service at the front desk, I'll never return!!!",

  "text": "I was really looking forward to Luke, but ended up leaving disappointed. I had heard such good things so my husband and I came to dinner on a Monday night. We were seated at a table backing up to the bar, which wasn't ideal but we dealt with it. We had two servers who were friendly enough, but for some reason just seemed very overwhelmed and unable to handle the tables they had. I had a bubbly to start and my husband had a beer. Both were fine but not special. I moved to a red wine for my meal, and it wasn't very good, especially not for the price point.\n\nTo start my husband got the stuffed oysters with shrimp and blue crab. They were very bready and underwhelming. The only crab to be found was small slivers. For our mains I had a shrimp, crab, and cavatelli étouffée. I expected more of a shrimp dish with some pasta underneath, but it was more like a pasta dish with minimal seafood. The shrimp was small and tasted like typical frozen shrimp. Like the appetizer, there wasn't really any real crab meat, just small sliver here and there. The pasta was fine but felt a tad overcooked. It honestly tasted like a pasta dish I could make quickly at home. And for around $26, that's ridiculous. My husband had the jumbo Louisiana shrimp with jalapeño grits. Luckily, his shrimp were large and flavorful. But the rest of the dish fell flat. The grits had very little flavor. \n\nToward the end of our meal a very large group came into the bar, it almost seemed like a post-wedding thing. They were very rude and kept backing into not only our chairs and table, but the people around us as well. A lot of us were getting frustrated and the staff couldn't have cared less. They did nothing to remedy the situation. We left as quickly as we could. All in all, the food was mediocre and this place felt like a tourist trap, which I hadn't been expecting. I'd go elsewhere while in New Orleans.",

My stuffed french toast was not cooked all the way through, and my fiance's breakfast sandwich was a mess.  I was also frustrated that my meal was served with imitation maple syrup in a plastic cup, considering our meal was $30 dollars before tip (you can add real maple syrup for $2, lol).  The hash browns were just terrible, they were slimy and tasted a month old.  The food was almost as good as a quality diner, but not quite.  The space is charming, but it seems like they have far more tables than the kitchen can keep up with.  We sat near the kitchen door and during our lengthy stay you could see the kitchen staff was barely keeping things together.  It's a shame to see a small kitchen working so hard with no hope of getting out of the weeds. The army of servers was very friendly and took our order promptly.

I was in the area, the weather was nice, and there was no wait, so we decided to stop.\n\nPros: dog friendly patio and a very nice (albeit slow) waiter. He also brought a bowl of water for said dog.\n\nCons: everything else\n\nService was very slow. Parties that ordered after us received their food first.\n\nWe ordered an omelet and the French toast. First of all, the French toast is deep fried. Nothing in the description on the menu alluded to the fact that I would be served deep fried bread for breakfast. In what world does French toast = deep fried bread? It only tasted like oil, and when I poked the bread oil just oozed out. So essentially you're eating oil soaked bread for breakfast. Drowning it in syrup didn't help with the flavor either. \n\nThe omelet also came out and was clearly covered in oil. Surprise surprise, it also just tasted like oil. It was served with 2 cold pieces of toast.\n\nUnless you enjoy eating oil for breakfast, you're better off waiting in line at Fido or heading down the street to J Christopher's. You'll get much better food for a similar (if not cheaper) price.",

  "text": "I used to belong to a Hand and Stone in Morristown. I ended up abruptly moving to NYC and needing a new phone number and assumed my membership cancelled when I never received an email from the spa. I called the Marlton location while in town on business and asked if those credits would transfer, to which they told me yes. I booked a facial and a massage a week in advance. I left both my phone number and email and when I received a confirmation email about the appointment I assumed all must have been well. I arrived early to my appointment to ensure that my credits were still okay to be used. The receptionist said she had to call Morristown, but did not stop me from going into either my facial OR massage. \n\nThe esthetician, Karen, was incredibly friendly and had a gentle touch. I wish she had done more extractions and really gone to work on my face. I appreciate the gentle-ness, but there's always a painful time during facials that you just have to grin and bear for better results, and I was hoping for more of that. Otherwise, I thought Karen was lovely. I was dismayed that between my facial and my massage there weren't any robes to transfer between rooms, so I got dressed and waited for about ten minutes while Karen tried to find my massage therapist, and then while she turned the room over until he came to get me. \n\nMy massage therapist asked about my concerns and then left  me to change. By the time we started the massage it was already about 2:15. He was good about asking me how the pressure was, but I felt like I've gotten better massages from an airport chair massage. He used a lot of forearm, and little else technique wise. The massage was not thorough in the slightest. No scalp massage, no middle back, parts of my arms and legs were barely covered. I've had enough fifty minute massages to know that this was lacking. The massage ended at 2:50, not even close to fifty minutes (nor sixty if you're counting the ten minute changing time). After I got dressed my massage therapist was outside with a bottle of water, but he did not walk me out the door. He said goodbye in the hallway and I was left wandering in circles (ended up in an employee break room!) before finding my way out front. \n\nWhen I went to check out I held my tongue on the massage because I figured I had paid for it a while ago, I would suck it up and chalk it up to a bad but free (minus tip) experience. I was then told by the receptionist that she had yet to get in touch with Morristown regarding my credits. I had a bad feeling about this. When she got ahold of them they told her the only way to access my credits was to have me sign up again. There is no hand and stone in or around New York City (where I live). I was NOT prepared to pay for two services, I would have never made the appointments, and I certainly would have cancelled them had I known the circumstances. I asked why this was not checked ahead of time,or even during my first appointment before I went into a SECOND appointment, and I didn't think it was fair what was happening. A manager was brought over who said she would take care of things and would give me a call before running my credit card (I wanted to leave my tip on it). I assumed she would call me to work out some sort of price. Which is when I would have addressed the poor massage situation. \n\nI checked my credit card today and they ran my credit card after the appointment without my permission. I am beyond furious and refuse to ever return to this location, and plan on telling everybody I know in the area to avoid it as well. This was an unacceptable situation and I hope that anybody reading this knows to make 100% sure their services are covered before going in.",

We had a party of 12 with lots of drinks ordered and the servers got it all right.  The problem was the food.  Prime rib was tough and overcooked.  The deviled eggs were dry and tasteless.  My husband did enjoy the wild boar ribs but the rest of our party was very underwhelmed by their meals.  Stick to drinks and appetizers and enjoy the atmosphere rather than coming for dinner.",

All it had on it was about 4 blackberries, arugula, two cubes of cheese, and a teaspoon of granola. No meat or bacon or anything. Disappointed to say the least. We were also rudely kicked out by the male worker in the front by the hostess stand when we were trying to purchase a T shirt. No explanation, just told he was clearing out the restaurant. Won't be coming back here and you shouldn't either.",

  "text": "Went for brunch today. Nice atmosphere with jazz band playing which was really cool and the gentlemen playing were talented. Food was mediocre at best and for the price I'd say was a major letdown. We had the duck spring rolls which were okay but at 7 dollars per roll left much to be desired. The bbq shrimp were okay and again for nearly $25 again left much to be desired. The eggs and bacon were decent. Two bloody Mary's were watered down and bland. The one star review is reflected by the service. We had some of the most inattentive service in NOLA (in about 10 trips over the past 5 years) and that's saying a lot as things here move at a much slower pace in general. Forgot coffee order, forgot Bloody drink order, no coffee refill, no follow up whatsoever from our waitress on anything and had to ask for literally every single item needed including utensils. The closest thing to a modicum of service I had was from the water guys. Walked out with $100 check for brunch and a feeling that they could care less about us as a customer. Also I should have known going in when I saw the host berate a more junior team member to nearly tears for supposedly mishandling customer checkin. Unfortunately they can likely get away with it because the place was packed.......sorry Mr. B but we won't be returning or recommending you.",

  "text": "I just don't want to write a bad review, but after talking with Stephanie this afternoon and getting no resolution I feel it's worth it. No need to name call, just the facts of what happened. I ordered 3 round cakes for a baby shower. All vanilla cakes with vanilla buttercream icing. One was a naked cake. It was supposed to be simple with slight scalloped edges on top. It was a disaster and looked so unprofessional everyone who has seen it couldn't believe that I paid money for it. We were going to stick the naked cake on top of another round, however all the round cakes came with a ring of buttercream roses on top. I was never told that there would be roses. Apparently this is their standard, but no one mentioned it to me, so how would I know it would be on there? Also when I stacked the cakes, the naked cake icing was a different color than the other two cakes. All the same icing, one super white and the other two were a yellow color. They tasted different and I know what the frosting should taste like since I had a sample of it before ordering. Obviously they messed up the icing on two of the cakes. Stephanie explained that they didn't know I would be stacking it so it didn't seem like it would matter. All the cakes were also supposed to be on cardboard that was cut to the size of the bottom of the cakes. Stephanie and I spoke about this on the phone and I emailed her a confirmation that this would be done. Naturally, they weren't cut so they stood out terribly on our cake base. Plus we had to take the naked cake off of its cardboard base so we could stack it, which was just annoying and unnecessary. Also the cakes were dry. It was just so disappointing all around. I really wanted to like this bakery, but for how many things they got wrong and then to not give me a refund considering the issues were their fault, I'm astounded.",

The sushi chef never made eye contact with us. We just had to talk at her, which made us feel rude. The only good thing we had was seared tuna. The rolls were HUGE! Way too big. So much rice and dripping in Siracha. Everything had tons of jalapeños and siracha. They never offered to take an order for my son. \nWe used the restroom on our way out and it was FILTHY!

A female waitress comes by and says she's training him and they are out of merlot.  I say that's okay and request a Cab instead; she returns and says they are out of Cab, I request the Pinot Noir, she returns again and says they are out of the Pinot Noir, I end up with the Malbec (4th choice). My friend got the 2 for 1 beer; in 90 degree heat (seated inside, but it's warm) she brings both beers at the same time.  After the food was delivered and finished, no one had checked on us.  I had to go to the bar to request a second glass of wine.  At this point there was a max of 6 people there with 3 at the bar.  The food wasn't good enough to make up for the lack of service.

There was absolutely NO parking. Very frustrating. Parked in someone's lot, didn't get towed. Phew!  Wa told to go to the back. Partly the fault of organizer since the room we were in held no more than 40.  I was squished and had no room to move. I was thinking Yelp had it wrong then the unthinkable happened. As I came to the buffet line, there was no food. I mean every hot plate was empty. This has never happened to me at a buffet, ever. It took a good 20 min for new food to arrive, meanwhile everyone was done eating. The food was OK and for $50 per person was overpriced. Hence the reason for 2 stars. The desserts were cookies and little brownie like things. Tasty but I was expecting more. Appetizers were tasty. Chairs were covered nicely and waitresses were nice. If not for the great acquaintances, I would had spent the $100 elsewhere. There are several people who may disagree but read all reviews.",

But I just had my first order of 2018 and they have definitely changed since last fall. The batter now has an overly pronounced cornmeal flavor and consistency and it really changes the crunch of the curd crust and overall taste. The cheese itself seemed a bit off too. There was always a mix of white and yellow cheddar curds in each order. This visit all the curds were yellow cheddar and had a \"Velveeta\" feel and taste to them, instead of the normal rich and stringy cheddar cheese. As a fan of the original version, I hope this was just a temporary change of the recipe or perhaps an off-day.",

I got 6 tiny shrimp 2 oysters 2 hush puppy's and 1 stuffed shrimp. Very tiny \"platter \" for $30. Usually very full of food. Now the biggest problem was the service! 25 min to be greeted by waitress and 10 more min to actually get the drinks. Refills were given if you were lucky enough to flag somebody down. Very disappointed! She even had a trainer. Three times drinks empty over 10 min. I'm sure they won't be there long if service does not improve!",

With ice cream and missing travs not being on the top of my list I went to work this am and remembered to call when I got home.

She hung up again. I dont like to hate on people's businesses but after the rudeness idc, the building is \"SUPER DIRTY\", there food isn't good, and there employees are trash.

First off you pay for parking I think $5.50 an hour (we bought two hours which was unnecessary, machine had small sign say Buy one Cocktail get one Free at Sculleys). Hostess asked where we want to sit, we said on the water, she said first come first serve, and we were pointed to the 3rd tiki and take a right to a dock with a platform of seats. We sat down at a decent place. I got to order margaritas blind sided with no price ($8.75 per small solo cup for house margarita btw). Ordered the firecracker shrimp because the waiter admitted when asked about conch fritters that it's mainly bread. Anyway, we won't be back due to only one drink was buy one get one and the food wasn't good, tasted like fried frozen food you can buy at local grocery. Save your hard earned money on something fresh and authentic, if you want expensive cheap food that you can get fast....then then is your place.",

Although they were great about making vegan options for 2 of us, all of the meals were disappointing. The flavors all tasted similar and boring. Nothing stood out to us. The bathrooms were freezing cold. They only have one bathroom for each gender and our party had to wait 5 minutes for the restroom every time we went. When you serve alcohol this is a problem. In addition the price of the prix fix menu was changed on us several times and we were still charged the higher amount. Our bill came to over 600 dollars for 4 people, and the food portions were small, luke warm, and lacked flavor even thought they were plated nicely. When I've paid that much for a meal in the past I always left impressed w a pleasant experience. I would never recommend this restaurant.",

I ordered meatloaf, mac & cheese, hash brown casserole, and okra, with fried cornbread and unsweetened tea to drink. When my order arrived, the meatloaf was burnt and looked several days old. The cook took fresh ketchup and poured around the top of the meatloaf to cover up the dark and burnt meat. The manager happened to walk by and I told her that I wasn't eaten this meatloaf. She asked why. I showed her what was served and she said she doesn't eat meatloaf and didn't know how it should look. She asked if she could get me another piece and I told her no, that it would come from the same pan. She replied, I guess your right. The server came by and filled my tea up with sweetened tea. When I poured sweet lot into the glass, it made the tea too sweet. After I finished what I was going to eat, another waiter brought me out another glass of sweetened tea. My cornbread didn't arrive until I was ready to leave. A picture of the meatloaf is attached. I have had several bad meals at this Cracker Barrel for dinner. Never a bad breakfast. The sad thing is that I own stock in the company and fill obligated in eaten there. Please go rather a couple of exits north at the Franklin, KY, or a couple of exits south at the Long Hollow exit to eat at a Cracker Barrel.",

Hubs ordered a pulled pork plate with cinnamon apples & mashed potatoes w/gravy. He tried the sweet & Carolina sauces and liked them both. The potatoes were very salty, but overall he was satisfied. I ordered the beef brisket with Mac & cheese, & the white beans. This beef brisket had no flavor, no moisture, & no smoky flavor. It was dry, stringy & so disappointing! Even dousing it with sauce couldn't make it palatable. I ended up taking it home to our dog. On the plus side, the Mac & cheese was very creamy, & the white beans were excellent.

He stated that it was a health code violation, and that they could not do it during their busy hours. Which is it? Doesn't violate a health code or when they are busy they cannot take the time to prepare the food up to the customer's standards? I love Chick-fil-A but I am extremely upset that, per their employee, they cannot accommodate changes to their menu during \"busy\" hours.",

  "text": "I'm not sure which type of tour the bulk of these yelpers went on but the free tour is disappointing.\n\nThe brief visit to the stables is by far and away the best part. The rest of the tour was standard brewery tour garbage.  Brief history of the brewery, a sample of Bud or Bud light, upselling the birch chips to make the water beer seem better. I wish they would do something more about the history of the buildings. If they did that it would be a much better experience.\n\nI would have given the tour 1 star except they were patient with me sampling the tappers at the end.  I settled on the Goose Island saison and it was delicious.  The bartender told me the staff drinks that over Bud so that should tell you something about the beer!\n\nWhere can you get a better free tour you ask? Come to Milwaukee and Miller will hook you up. From the history video, to the caves, to the building histories, to 3-4 free samples the Miller tour is a much slicker and informative free tour. I think Bud could stand to send its employees on it to get an idea how to improve its own game!",

After she spilled all her receipts in the dish water, she grabbed my boxes.  I opened them to look for sauce (none provided for the cheese sticks) and utensils.  After trying to give me  cocktail sauce, then a couple phone calls, they finally found the marinara sauce.  Got to my office to discover that my chef salad was lettuce, meat, and cheese.

Unfortunately the customer service I've received from the Lindbergh location has been less than desirable.  I ordered food today and found that there was a missing item when I reached home. I quickly returned with my food and receipt and was met with an immediate attitude.

  "text": "After today, I have to regretfully give Marathon a two star rating. I have eaten here a few times before and the food has always been pretty good. Their burger is tasty, juicy, but a little bit messy. Their Philadelphia-style take on a Caprese is very good as well. On their food alone I would give Marathon four stars, but there are other issues. The noise level (extreme) and cramped sitting room (they try to pack in as many people as possible) takes that rating down to 3 stars easily. Today I ordered a Caesar salad with *blackened chicken* to go. There salads always look fantastic when you watch them go by your table while you're eating there. The salad I got today though was awful. The chicken was, in my opinion, undercooked and cold, and certainly not blackened. The salad itself was drowning in dressing and the croutons are bland and leave a bad taste in your mouth. To top it off, the salad by itself is $12 or $13, if you add chicken it's $16. This is high even for the city. I expected a much better tasting salad and my opinion of this place has taken a major hit.",

Moreover, the place was very dirty and quite empty for the time of day.  I could see why! Food was below average, I left the majority of it.  We asked for the manager.  Waited about 10 minutes for his arrival.  Totally arrogant and cocky, a real jerk. Could care a less about anything we said.  Talked down to us, like we were beneath him.

We visited this morning (Sunday, 2/11/2018) for brunch (group of 4), and were seated promptly. The server took our order relatively quickly, and then it begun. We waited. And waited. And waited. We waited for 40 minutes after placing our order before inquiring about our food. We were assured it would be \"right out\". We waited about 20 more minutes. At this point we asked again. Our server said \"2-3 more minutes\". At this point we were incredibly irritated and seriously thought we were being punk'd (where's Ashton?). We set a stopwatch. 12 minutes later (approximately 1 hour and 12 minutes after ordering, for those counting) we received 3 out of 4 of our meals. The 4th meal came 13 minutes after the other 3. THE FUN DOESN'T END HERE FOLKS. 1 of our meals was piping hot, the other 3 were freezing cold. 2 of us had hair in our food. We asked for the manager, he apologized- giving some excuse about their kitchen being busy- and comped our meals. We will never EVER EVER be back. Ever.",
