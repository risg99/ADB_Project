So if you want a small taste you only need 1. The cheese is really good too, try the roasted beets with the ricotta. Yum! I would always recommend Tria for great wine and great food.",

We found this hidden gem a few months back, it's a small place with limited seating inside but let me tell you it's worth the wait. \nWe have gotten sandwiches, wings, salads and pizza from here. I can't just like one as everything here is out of this world.\nThey have the best pizza ever. Someone sitting next to us tried to compare this to Anthony's, no way can this be compared. Fireside is a 100 times better.",

  "text": "I rarely write reviews but after spending $200+ for 4 adults and a child for Sunday brunch, I feel it is necessary.  I love food and I have no problem spending a lot of money on food but there was nothing memorable about this experience other than how much I enjoyed the atmosphere and the company, which we brought ourselves.  The salads were unique but didn't offer anything exciting in flavour. The eggs on the bennies were poached hard, potatoes were undercooked and the chai/eggnog pudding was more like a gelatine, wasn't smooth and creamy as  it should be.  The omelette my husband had made was slightly undercooked on the inside.  No one at the table raved about anything that they had and we left the restaurant uninspired. The Huevos Benedict was the only item that was intriguing and the one Benedict out of the 4 at our table that wasn't poached hard, and I did enjoy that.  When you spend $40+ for a brunch, you want to keep returning to try everything and it is so unfortunate that this was not the case.   The service was ok.",

The interior is a little spacious and has a lot of seatings which is great for family and groups. Like some reviews, I agree that the broth is not as flavorful and it somehow tastes similar. The noodle itself was a little soggy as well. However, on the positive note, the service was very good, the staffs were very attentive and our food came out fast and hot. For about $11-13 the portion here is very generous, your belly will be fully satisfied :) Perhaps it was a bad day but this place has potential. Might come again in the future",

But wow, this place is a giant disappointment - especially after all the hype it had. \n\nMy biggest complaints:\n1) Asked for no onions in the quesadilla, they couldn't do that BECAUSE THEY PREMAKE THEIR QUESADILLA. That might be the easiest thing to make, ever, and they pre make it. \n\n2) No fajitas..? Are you serious. \n\n3) No margaritas?!?! I know they have them at the cantina but damn - figure that out.. You're a Mexican restaurant missing the first three things I think of about a Mexican restaurant.",

I also highly recommend the taste of the bayou sampler, the chicken and andouille gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and red beans and rice.  Red beans are some of the best I've had in New Orleans.  Fried alligator is very good as well, especially the creole mustard sauce it comes with.  The staff is super friendly and the place itself has a great feel to it.  And you can't beat the local right on canal st.  Shout out to my buddy Colin Kennedy who the manager at this fine establishment.  Will definitely be back with friends to try more creole cuisine in the near future!",

  "text": "Went here for a business dinner, got a ton of apps to share: fries, Brussels sprouts, fried chanterelle mushrooms, mashed potatoes. Also, some sort of seafood raw bar- \"Le plateau\"? Such a well stocked tower of seafood- a little sumtinsumtin  for everyone, except for the people with seafood allergies, they were SOL.\nFor entree I got the red snapper with white bean ragu and garlic custard. So, I usually share or offer friends to try my dish, but in a flurry of utensils flying from my plate to my mouth, by the time I looked up and took a breath, I was already done... I guess it was that good ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \nThen for dessert bread pudding amongst other things- even though I was stuffed I utilized my second stomach and tried everything and then finished everything. \nI ate some much at this business dinner, hope I didn't make a bad impression.",

It is no longer a \"vegan paradise\" as one five star reviewer stated. They do have many of the same items as before But they also have piles of BOARS HEAD BACON where the hummus used to be. The hot bar is no longer vegan. Instead of paper sacks , if needed, they give out hideous, heavy plastic bags. I do not feel bad about going to Whole Foods anymore. Goodbye, Essene.

Now, I have to tell you, every red velvet cake I've ever had has been dry and not that appetizing. Like its supposed to taste good, but it doesn't. However, on this occasion-- this flavor left me begging for more and I came back for a second trip down and up hill in my skimpy snow ware for red velvet ice cream.\n\namazing.",

  "text": "I was very excited for this place to open. I live down the street and mexican food is my favorite. There's not a lot of places within walking distance to even go eat at besides the usual pizza and sandwiches. However, I was a little disappointed. I'm a vegetarian so my opinion is a little bias, but the food was very average. You walk in and order on touch screens. They really need a \"build your own option\". The vegetarian options were very limited. I did however like that the veg options were pretty healthy. I went with the veg bowl which was average - filling because of the egg and quinoa but nothing special with the taste. Kinda salty too. We waited a long time for our food (considering it's supposed to \"fast\"). They didn't offer any hot sauce or anything to fill up on the side - instead they had ketchup and mustard which is just so strange for a taco place. There's additional seating upstairs, but it kind of smells like a bathroom up there. The wait staff was very friendly. \n\nI don't see myself trying this place again, it was nothing extraordinary at all.",

So nice and helpful since they have a great big yummy menu board. We decided on a City Sampler. We were so pleased! (They have Nehi soda!!! Just a blast from the past!)\nThe slaw is the best I have ever had. The beans, I have to admit are even better than mine. They were cooked to perfection with some brisket in them. The meats were tender and tasty. The sauces were good, the original my favorite, but in the end, I felt like it was an injustice to put sauce on any of them, since they stood up well on their own. The brisket was my favorite. The wood was piled high outside and the smell of the fire was just heavenly. \nOn to the nice people! Even though you go up to get your food, we were so kindly attended to. We went at a slow time, which is our typical dinner time. I can imagine the place gets really busy though. \nThe atmosphere was very fitting for a barbecue place. I love the barbecue history on the wall. I love the wood and the aluminum ceiling. \nWe got our food very quickly, but in NO WAY was this fast food. Just well prepared, easy to serve and cooked to perfection. The prices, considering what we got were frankly amazing. I am marking this as under $10 per person, but we don't get drinks, so factor that in. \nI could keep going, but I have banana pudding to try! I get the feeling they are going to get to know my husband and I very well!",

Chef George was cool enough to give me three of their sauces to try which were all good but not the right fit. Then, he brought out the volcano red sauce and man that was a perfect pair!! Coming back here again soon.  Tiffany was our waitress and she was fast and very friendly.",

Our party had burgers - there are much better burgers to be had within a mile of this place; and country fried steak - almost inedible.  Worse was they only have 3 beers on tap.  What?!?!?",

  "text": "This was our second time at TBBC.  The first time we went for drinks and apps and that's what we should have done this time.\n- When we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand.  We didn't wait that long but when the hostess walked up she literally just stared at us.   I mean, she didn't say a word.  No greeting, no welcome, nothing.  Zero, zip, nada.   VERY strange behavior for a hostess.   She actually never said anything so we finally told her we had a party of six and she took us to a table.   The table she took us too was crammed into a corner and was just a very uncomfortable fit.   We asked if we could move to another table, a round one up by the bar, and you would have thought we'd asked her for a kidney.   She seemed so put out and exasperated that we would asked to be moved.  \n- Our group ordered appetizers, which were good.  Nothing spectacular though...yummy cheese and mustard sauces for the, obviously, frozen pretzels.  The salsa was okay, chips, meh.  Hands down, Chili's has the best chips around.   Several of our party tried the beer flights, which they really enjoyed.   \n- This is the first time we've ever eaten inside, and we did not have this when we ate outside the previous time, but they brought bottles of cold water, about the size of a wine bottle, to your table, where water glasses already sat.   They kept replenishing the bottles throughout the meal.  A cute concept but had to keep asking for ice (they brought one glass, to be shared with the table).  Like I said, cute concept, but again, I personally prefer ice water and don't want to have to keep asking for ice during my meal.  \n- The food.  Ahhh, where to begin?    I had a cup of their beer cheese soup, which, WAS tasty, but it just seemed to be lacking something.   Which, honestly, pretty much sums up everything there.   I ordered the Southwest Black Bean Burger with a side of fries (fries, at the recommendation of our server, over the white-cheddar mashed potatoes).    This was truly one of the most BLAH burgers I have ever eaten.  If I had not asked for onion on it, I don't think it would have had ANY taste.  The guacamole crème on the burger had NO taste, at all.   I think it was just pureed avocado, with nothing else added.   Another thing, and this is just my personal preference, the buns are ciabatta and I just don't like ciabatta buns for a burger.   I like a good, old-fashioned, sesame-seed topped hamburger bun.   I only ate about a third of the burger and left the rest.  The fries were completely non-descript; McDonald's fries are a 1,000 times better.  My boyfriend ordered their Red-Eye burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare; it was served well-done with SO much extras glopped on, he had to eat it with a fork.  He, however, got some fancy ketchup for his fries, which I did not.   The fancy ketchup still couldn't disguise the fact that the fries were so blah.\n- Overall, a very lacking and disappointing experience.    We would definitely not go back for a meal, and not even sure if we would for apps and drinks.  Personally, I don't care for craft beer and there are many other places to go with better drink offers and better apps.",

  "text": "Getting tired of the same restaurants and Happy Hours at Streets of Saint Charles?! Me too! Thank goodness for a new place to eat at.. \nI will be honest, I was skeptical of this \"steakhouse\" opening because I thought the prices would be high but the prices are comparable if not lower than the other restaurants at Streets. \nThe Happy Hour is by far the best in the area. Several drinks ranging from $5-7. Appetizers/small plates ranging from $5-7. The Mahi tacos were certainly my favorite part of the trip, cooked perfectly with a delicious avocado salsa and scrumptious sauce on top. I tried the black diamond martini upon the waitress' request and I was not disappointed-- it was simply amazing! We also tried the pretzel and beer cheese dip, shrimp tacos, and buffalo style chicken tenders-- all of which were delicious. The beer cheese dip wasn't AS incredible as the rest but the competition was steep! Someone has to come in last place, right?\nThe service was phenomenal!! Catherine was our server and she couldn't have made a better first impression. My friend is quite the talker and Catherine did well entertaining my friend while remaining attentive, professional, and friendly.  Rich, the manager, and Earl, the chef, stopped by the table to make sure my friend and I were satisfied. They were very pleasant as well. \nThe atmosphere and decor is beautiful. We sat in the \"Firebar\" by the fireplace which was comfortable and relaxing. \nThey certainly set the bar high tonight, I hope the newness doesn't wear off.",

We discovered this place early on and it has remained a favourite since our arrival.  I am only half joking when I tell people that we bought our home in Oliver to stay within walking distance of this place.  It's truly fantastic.\n\nThe salads?  Outstanding.  Every single one.  And I have tried all the vegetarian ones.  The appetizers?  Delicious.  Again, every vegetarian one.  Desserts?  Spectacular.  All of them.  (We sometimes even walk to Famoso just to get a scoop of their gelato).  The wine?  Fantastic.  Every recommendation from the staff has been spot on.  The coffee?  Sublime.\n\nBut the main reason we come here is for the pizza.  It is simply wonderful.  Their thin crust is crisp, yet pliable, always cooked to perfection.  And every pizza combination we have tried has been superb (and we have tried every vegetarian pizza, in both red sauce and white sauce - I love that you can switch up the sauces!).  Their seasonal pizzas are always top-notch as well.  \n\nWe've never been disappointed when coming to Famoso, oh, except when the line is longer than we were hoping.  But an hour to wait for this meal is worth it!  Totally worth it.",

Our servers were amazing and so helpful in suggestions. We started with the fried green tomatoes. So yummy. Next was the BBQ shrimp. Oh my goodness. The sauce... save your bread they bring to the table with the butter to dip in this sauce. You get two pieces with the dish but more is needed to soak up the last drop. Bowl is worth licking if no one is looking. We then got the fried oyster appetizer and another super tasty dish. Simple but amazing. We finished with the white chocolate brownie that was suggested by our server as her favorite. She didn't steer us wrong. Another amazing dish at Mr. B's. Everyone around us was raving in about their food too. Go here you won't be disappointed. Drink specials were also fabulous. I'll be raving about this meal for a long time.",

  "text": "I was visiting my best friends sister on music row and she recommended Edgehill Cafe to us because we were looking to grab a quick bite to eat. I walked in around 10:30 and walked up to the counter and was told the kitchen was closed. Talk about feeling bummed out after looking over their tasty menu options. We were standing outside for about 10 minutes and got called back in because the kitchen was some how opening. I am not sure what happened, but I am sure glad I was able to order my Belgian waffle. I added bananas and chocolate chips for a .50 cent up charge and it took the waffle to the next level. The waffle is made with a cinnamon vanilla buckwheat batter and topped with walnuts and syrup. The waffle also comes with a side and I went with the bacon of course. It was nice thick and crispy. You can tell they only use the freshest of ingredients. The coffee mugs are a pretty decent size which allowed me to enjoy more of my peach white tea. \n\nWhat I thought made this cafe unique was that it served beer. This isn't your typical coffee shop. They have something for everyone. You also order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when its ready. The interior was very modern chic. I loved the tufted benches and light fixture in the larger dining area. They also have a really neat patio and lots of tables inside. I would recommend this place if you are looking to grab a quick breakfast.",

However, Schlafly Bottleworks has a couple minor details to work on. \n\nCons\n \n- No wait service in the bar area. You must go to the bar to order everything and the 1 food runner/buser was not good at all about coming and cleaning off dirty dishes from the tables. I carried most of our dirty plates away myself b/c we ran out of room on the table. Yuck! Let's work on the service aspect guys.\n\n- The food is not that great. I would give the food 2.5 stars after multiple visits. \n\nPros \n\n- Awesome atmosphere. The bartender got up and sang a song with the band. Pretty laid back and friendly all around. \n\n- Kick ass, huge patio/beer garden in the summer, and they have live bands out there too. Always a fun time! \n\n- They host multiple beer festivals throughout the year.\n\n- Obviously, fantastic locally made micro brews. Pumpkin Ale, Oktoberfest, and Summer lager seasonals are my favorites!\n\nOverall, I LOVE SCHLAFLY. The end.",

  "text": "My first experience with the Prohibition Taproom was my housemate Jonny telling me that messed up his drink order and that he was not impressed. Despite that, I wanted to try out this new place.\n\nBefore I even walked in, I was greeted by an awesome sign pointing out the business. It's a simple neon red sign that tersely states \"BAR.\" I like it a lot. Once inside, I was loving the atmosphere. The bar is really great, as you can kind of see in this picture. It runs the length of the room, but also has a few peninsulas. The result is that you can sit at the bar and be across from whoever you are with, which is a great feature.\n\nAs far as beer goes, PT does not disappoint. There are about ten beers on draft. Further, the choices represent a well thought out variety of brews. PT also supplies a nice bottle list as a supplement. I had the Dogfish Head Aprihop and Brooklyn Brewery Blunderbuss and enjoyed both beers.\n\nI can seriously recommend to anyone to go to Prohibition Taproom for one reason: deep-fried green beans. This phenomenal appetizer is a great way to start your meal and comes with a nice aioli. The rest of the food was average. Between Lana, J.Mal, and myself, we ordered two burgers and a grilled cheese, and these three dishes were fine, nothing more. I was happy to be full, but the main dishes are the lowest point of the experience.\n\nFriday night this place got a little crazy, with a crowd from art museum area and plenty of \"bros.\" Don't make this your Friday or Saturday night hangout spot.\n\nBottom Line: I like this new place. It has good atmosphere, beer, and one excellent appetizer. Prohibition Taproom has made it onto my list of bars to regularly visit. The biggest downside are the hours. No lunch, no brunch, and the bar opens at 4pm.",

You can adjust your sweetness level to your liking, so you don't have to worry about any drink being overly sweet. The staff is very friendly and will always help you decide on drink.  A great place to stop in and get a drink,  hang out to chat with friends, work, or play games. They have a small set of games that customers can play. It is also in range of a PokemonGo gym. \nDownsides: As with most bubble teas, most (but not all) of the flavored options use syrups mixed with the tea base. Sometimes the internet is spotty.",

Don't get me wrong, this is my neighborhood dive, and I'll take a dive over a pretentious snot bar any day. The food is alright, though there isn't much for veggies here. I usually get the spinach salad with bacon on the side for my critters, and something other than hot bacon dressing. The salad is generously portioned and pretty good. The atmosphere is LOUD. What?! It's loud! And your ears will usually be assaulted by wall shaking trendoid pop. The service here is dicey, unless you're a regular, then you might just get a PG rated version of a lap dance, while less recognized customers await, parched and frustrated. Nevertheless, the price is right, and it is MY dive bar.",

To where you could not even get the enjoyment out of eating the beans because the sauce was so over powering. \n\nAnother thing about this restaurant I did not like was this.

  "text": "District, your staff is always super nice. The owner who is always there is also very nice and always greets us. Your coffee is good and that Miso Praline breakfast sandwich is like the blood of virgins between two biscuits. One of my favorite things to eat. Ever. Your donuts are always a treat, who doesn't like a damn donut? Maybe a gluten free vegan? But what the hell do they like anyway....\n\nContrary to what I just wrote, I don't really visit anymore. We got really sick of paying close to $30 to get breakfast from a donut shop that isn't full service. Also, the last time we went there I called in an order and waited in line to get it. While I was in line, I saw a lady tap a man and his daughter on the shoulder while they were eating their donuts and ask them, \"Excuse me, is that good?\" First of all, let this man enjoy a donut with his child in peace. Secondly, what the hell do you think? It's a chocolate donut filled with rice pudding. You like donuts? You like chocolate? You like rice pudding? Badda fucking Bing Bozo! It's a $2.50 investment. Donuts are like a roll in the hay, even when it's bad, it's good. \n\nClearly that experience made me realize that my neighborhood donut shop is frequented by tourists with dumb questions and intrusive behavior. I'll probably go back at some point on a slow day, but if anyone interrupts my snarfing session with a dumb question about a glazed donut, I'll let one out that's so vile, the whole place will be forced to evacuate.",

  "text": "One of the best brunch spots in town.  Get there early though because the secret was out long ago. Trying to get in on a sat/sun around 11-1 and you are probably looking at an hour plus wait. Why is it so popular? It probably has to do with the 2-4-1 cocktails, or maybe the red velvet waffles with cream cheese drizzle, or perhaps it's the signature \"white trash hash\"... a delicious concoction of cheese, hash browns, and scallions rolled into an almost crispy-shelled ball of tasty delight.  They have takes on all the traditional brunch classics as well... a variety of egg/benedict themed plates, waffles, and of course biscuits.  \n\nWhat I really like is that for all the heavy brunch menu items they have there is also a whole \"skinny\" section devoted entirely to those who are taking it light and counting calories. An egg white scramble, yogurt, and salads are among some of the things you will find on that menu. The brunch libations don't really pull any punches even though drinks are buy one get one free. Bloody Marys, trumped up Mimosas, and my favorite, the red berry sangria. \n\nMy advice is to get there right when they open at 10am. There will be a few people already lined up but you won't wait.  You'll be glad you did because by the time you leave the waiting area will be packed and you'll be able to walk out happy knowing you didn't have to sit through all that mess.",

  "text": "Well, well, well...Cunningham Restaurant Group strikes again!  They are on fire and setting the rest of Indy on fire with them.  First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. \"This place would make a great business\" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.  We had the livery which is more of the standard and the carriage house which is more Texas, which is understating it because both are made with more than average ingredients.  Both were fantastic drinks! Upon being seated we were served some house made chicharones that were a nice crisp accented with a lime flavor that went well with our margaritas. I'm going to skip to the dessert because it blew us away!  The apple flan is a bit of culinary genius.  The texture was a silky smooth bit of creamy perfection served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side with a little garnish of a sweet cooked apple slice topped with I believe candied Marcona almonds. Yes, it tasted even better than it sounds.  They are making their desserts in house, and that includes the freaking ice cream.  I can't wait to see what kind of ice cream concoctions they come up with.  It's not my intention to take away from the small plates because we were not disappointed with our choices.  We shared the ceviche and the chicken empanadas.  Both were flavorful and delicious to the last bits. Lastly, Michael, Lee, and Phillip were all so very friendly and took the time to speak with us throughout our visit.  Throw all of this together with the very warm welcome we received as well as the very attentive service, and we had a spectacular Livery experience.",

  "text": "UPDATE: Roberto, the owner reached out to me and showed true care and compassion for his business and customers. We had multiple discussions back and forth and I could tell he wanted to make my poor experience better and because of this, I told him I would give them another chance. I went in this morning and was greeted by a very nice gentleman behind the counter and then given some additional information about my order that I was unaware of by the barista, which was greatly appreciated. My order was also made quickly, even with me waiting behind another customer. My drink still wasn't very hot but definitely an improvement from this past weekend. I am happy to re-rate The Blind Tiger. Thank you Roberto! We should have more local businesses show this much care. \n\nInitial Review:\nI have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.",

  "text": "This place is a half step above pizza hut;  a glorified Dominos. As a pizza connoisseur, I should have known better than to order from a chain,  especially when the yelp reviews lacked sufficient descriptions of the pizza (so many comment just say things like \"great pizza\" or \"good food\"). I ordered, online,  the special that included a one-topping pizza, bread sticks, and drinks and had it delivered;  my pizza was a thin-crust spicy pepperoni.  The good: The delivery was  relatively fast, the food was warm, pepperoni was plentiful, and the delivery guy was nice, which is why I can't give it a 2 or 1. The bad: the pizza tastes JUST LIKE domino's thin crust,  same texture, same cardboard-y-ness and the breadsticks tasted like big half-baked dough balls...I couldn't finish any of it. When I look at the reviews, I realize that I just must be a pizza snob. ..so many people like the pizza and have no complaints. Maybe these people are like my husband who just thinks \"a pizza is a pizza no matter where you go.\" Being from Chicago, I grew up with the gold mine of pizzas; I can't except that...the search continues!",

My entree wasn't listed online. The old standard guacamole was delicious - lemony, a little chunky and a little spicy. I had the chicken, rice and vegetable entree which was flavorful. It comes with black beans and a side of plantains. Another in our party had the Ropa Vieja - shredded beef Cuban style. It too was delicious.  The sopapilla dessert was worth the calories. It is not like any others I have had - sweet, crispy dough with a cream cheese custard inside.",

  "text": "Many people judge a bar's staying power by the Cheers standard -- they want a place where everybody knows their name.\n\nAt M.L. Rose, nobody knows my name. I'll forgive them, though, because after I gorge myself on their juicy burger and luscious cheese fries, I don't even remember my name. In fact, that's probably why no one knows me -- my face is always buried in their food and subsequently covered in condiments.\n\nFor drink afficionados, I have two words: Beer. Selection. M.L. Rose has it. You'll find a deep lineup of bottles (and a few diverse drafts), as well as a delightful array of seasonal options. You can also treat yourself to some of the world's best beers, like Delirium Tremens and Chimay.\n\nIf you go to this grease factory, you must get the loaded cheese fries. Waffles, Wisconsin cheddar, whopping amounts of sour cream and chives...you'll love them and hate yourself afterward, especially if you've also ordered a burger. It'll be generously sized, too. \n\nIf you go to M.L. Rose and clean your plate, look for me. I'll be waiting with a high five, a beer and heartburn pills. I'm easy to find -- I'm the guy nobody knows.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is my favorite bar in town, but it doesn't get five stars. Two things hurt its rating: \n\n1) There aren't a ton of draft options. Bottles abound, but if you love a crisp draft, you'll get quality but not quantity. \n\n2) They recently turned the table-top back-room seating into booths with high dividers. It puts a damper on the atmosphere, especially during trivia night, when the interaction and people-watching used to be just as fun as the contest itself.\n\n**Second disclaimer: Go to Tuesday trivia. It's the best in town. You won't beat my team, but the second-place prize is pretty decent.",

We were quickly greeted and given menus and brought out our beverages.\n\nThey sell pizza by the slice, so I got 2 slices of pepperoni and my wife got a calzone. The calzone was huge, filled with ricotta cheese, pepperoni and served with a side of marinara. The pizza was good. It was a bit greasy, but you could hold it up without it sagging.\n\n The restaurant was clean, had a nice interior decor and didn't have the typical feel of a \"New York\" pizza joint. The prices are reasonable, service was good and friendly. For those reasons I rate it a bit higher than what I might based on food alone.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant.",

Of course, the brews are top-notched and quality is evident in the clean taste of the beer, the clean glasses that gets served and the knowledge that the wait staff have about the beers.  I was there with my wife, my 6 month old daughter, and my sister in law.  We had numerous questions about the beers.  Our waiter, Ed, was extremely courteous, patient, and funny in a natural, easygoing manner.  That wasn't the thing that stood out from my experience at Iron Hill.  Our waiter went out of his way to get my 6 month old daughter a bowl of mashed sweet potatoes despite it not being on the menu.  Another member of the waitstaff told us it wasn't possible, but our waiter convinced the kitchen to make it for us even though it's not a complicated dish and that the sweet potatoes are already there for the sweet potatoes fries, which IS on the menu.  It's moments like this that makes an establishment stand out in my mind because they made my daughter feel comfortable and they seem extremely understanding of parents and infants.  If that wasn't it, I forgot my credit card and some of my daughter's things when we left.  They kept everything safe for me when I returned to get it.  No attitudes and no strange looks.  The folks are well trained in restaurant service and are as professional as it gets.  Kudos to the whole team there.  We will be returning soon.",

They also took reservations and that was a bonus because we didn't know how busy it would be on a Friday evening with a game. We got seated right away (5:45pm) and it was not busy at all but just after 6p the place started to get busy. Our server was really nice and made sure our drinks were always filled. It did not take long to get our food either. \n\nWe got the Beer Cheese Tots for our stater and this was really good. The bacon pieces were especially delicious. My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Burger. This is ground chicken with buffalo sauce. Which I really loved the idea because I was worried it would be more of a fried chicken sandwich. He also got the zucchini straws. The straws were so-so and not something we would order again but the garlic black pepper aioli that comes with the straws was absolutely delicious. The burger was just ok. It was a bit plain for me and could have used more buffalo sauce. There were some toppings missing that were listed on the menu and not a lot of the gorgonzola aioli on the burger. I got the Stanford which is their turkey burger and again kind of plain. Again there was hardly any of the tarragon mayo. The meat just didn't seem seasoned. To be fair we probably could have asked for more aioli and gotten some on the side but I hardly to do that when a restaurant is busy. If it's on the menu then it should be on the burger. I had the caesar salad as my side which is just your basic side salad. Overall I wasn't very impressed. I would probably go back just for convenience and to try one of the beef burgers but it wouldn't be something I was necessarily looking forward too after this first experience.",

The sauce it came with had a good flavor.  Husband got one with the chorizo--the jalapeños made it over the top too spicy it overpowered the other flavors and the cheese sauce was salty and tasteless. Service was very good as well, we liked the atmosphere  Overall okay, but we have no plans to return.",

They forgot an item (not a huge deal) and the owner/manager gave us a free dessert. The pizzas are overall decent, but flavors a bit weak (bland cheese, tart sauces) and (as others have noted) some corners cut in the quality of ingredients (e.g. less-than-ripe tomatoes in the peak local tomato season). Greek salad sort of bland and sterile too. The counter-ordering arrangement is nice and casual, but gets a bit chaotic the more people are waiting. So overall okay.",

  "text": "I've been to this place on several locations & one thing I can say about it is \"Consistent\". The food is average, maybe a little better than some of the other chain restaurants out there... but most of the stuff is shipped and then they try to put a homemade twist on it.... I've had worse, but I've had better... I will say that the Blue Cheese Chips & Wings were better than the 3 stars I gave the place, but the pizza was average... \n\nThe service is hit & miss. You either get a good one who takes good care of you, or one that is always slow with your orders and really not that personable... But you get what you pay for. \n\nI do think they need to do a little remodeling. The place is dive bar charmy, but really dated.... don't get me wrong, I like dive bar charmy, but not from the 70's (and I do know that's my opinion only).",

  "text": "I finally went to Ghini's and now will be a repeat customer!  My friend MB suggested we have lunch at Ghini's and I was totally down with the idea. For quite some time, I have been hearing good things about this little cafe from a mass amount of fellow foodie friends and simply hadn't gotten around to trying it.  \nGhini's is a darling little cafe with quaint indoor seating and a large patio in front.  Since the weather was nice, we debated indoors or outdoors but eventually decided indoors. They have a phenomenal drink menu.  It is one of those menus that I have to narrow it down to 4-5 drinks and then decide. So many yummy coffee drinks on their menu!  I was in the mood for something refreshing and so I went with an Orangina.  Next trip, I will be trying the chocolate hazelnut mocha. \nLots of deliciousness is on their lunch menu and again comes the hard part of making a decision. MB has been to Ghini's on many occasions and raved about their Croque Madame.   Eventually, we both decided on soup and salad.  I had the  baby field greens, which were lovely and they had the perfect amount of dressing. We each had the French onion soup, which was so flavorful and pretty much perfection.  \nLa Baguette Bakery is inside and we made a quick stop there on our way out to admire all the pastries, breads, tarts and cookies!  MB bought chocolate croissants and I purchased a big sugar cookie loaded with sprinkles as a treat for my favorite kid.  He shared a bite with me and it may have been the BEST sugar cookie I've encountered.  \nI love it when you leave a restaurant feeling totally and completely blissed out by the experience, which is exactly how I left Ghini's.",

  "text": "Listen, I love ML Rose. I'm there pretty often since I live on the west side. I'm so happy to have it in my neighborhood. I even went on Christmas last year. \n\nThe full rundown: \n\n-All of the tables are a free-for-all, so if it is crowded, you're kind of out of luck. I don't really have that vulture instinct in me, so if there aren't any tables, I head out. \n\n-Service is super hit or miss. Sometimes super fast. Sometimes super slow. \n\n-Avoid the nachos and quesadillas! Not worth it. Their guac is pretty good, though. \n\n-Burgers are decent. Not the best in the city but by no means the worst either. The toppings options are top notch. \n\n-Great beer selection! \n\n-Great atmosphere! Kind of eclectic, kind of sporty, kind of bro-y, kind of hip. Meets lots of demographics without trying too hard or seeming scattered. \n\n-The MAIN reason to go to ML Rose: THE WAFFLE FRIES.  Specifically, the loaded or the bleu cheese+bacon. They are worth it. My friend and I usually get a burger with slaw as our side then split a large order of fries. It's the best decision, I promise.",

  "text": "An unimpressive breakfast establishment with mediocre service and food.\n\nMy friends and I wanted to find a sit-down breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work. After browsing through Yelp, it seemed like Ghini's was the only candidate nearby. Although their door and website state that they opened at 6:30am, they seemed to be running late and didn't open until 6:45am. We had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes. Eventually, our waiter came and, being slightly flustered, took our orders quickly. I was surprised to find that you can't order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe (apparently, they're separate businesses?) For example, you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table, but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter (strange). Anyway, I ordered the Egg Provençal with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast. It really did seem like I had an overcooked order of 6 eggs - just a huge portion off rubbery sadness! (You might be better off ordering the eggs over easy).  The toast was overly buttered as well, which is fine if you like it that way. The only good thing I had was their cafe au lait, which was served in a huge mug. My friend had the breakfast sandwich, and she thought it was decent. With just a few tweaks, Ghini's can be great, but I'm afraid I'd go elsewhere for breakfast or brunch.",

Came here for dinner with a friend using a Groupon that included one starter, two sandwiches/burgers and one dessert. \n\nGuacamole -- you could definitely tell that it was made fresh to order as they claim on the menu, but it was SO bland. There were barely any red onions, cilantro or jalapeno in it, and it looked and tasted like mashed up avocados.\n\nCowboy Burger -- this was pretty good. The brioche bun was toasted nicely and didn't get soggy. The patty was thick and cooked medium, which is what I asked for. Even though it had melted cheese, barbecue sauce, bacon and an onion ring, it didn't feel overly greasy. It came with fries which there were a TON of. I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for dessert. \n\nMile-High Apple Pie -- this is ginormous! It was served warm with vanilla ice cream. Crust was nice. Overall it was yummy. But after a while I got tired of eating all those apples so I think I prefer a regular not-mile-high apple pie. \n\nEven though they have more than just ice cream (ha), that's probably the only thing I'd come back for.",

They are known for their brisket but personally I have found it to be a bit dry and do not care for it -- I would stick with their pulled pork and delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs.  I am a big fan of their sauce more so than other joints, and prefer their mac 'n' cheese over both Edley's and Peg Leg.  If you save room, the Pecan Pie is life-altering.  They also have a good local beer selection and ample parking.  \n\nDespite all the positive reviews, I've yet to try the nachos -- next time!\n\nPro-tip: There is no hostess so drop your name in the bucket when there is a wait!",

Most recently I went on my birthday when my Fiance took me out to lunch, we had their Fritatta and Soup of the Day (It was this potato and corn chowder, kind of spicy which I liked) combo (She had a cup of their Chai also which I tried and found much to my liking).\n\nTheir staff is always at least polite if not outright nice. I'm not all that interested in things that are \"Vegan\" or \"Non-GMO\" or anything of that sort of nature, and while that is largely what they sell I find myself not really caring since the food is good, filling, and reasonably priced. A lot of Mid-Town joints can be fairly pricy, but this is a place you can easily do lunch for two for around $16. The place is kind of hipster-y in my opinion but it doesn't stop me from enjoying myself there.\n\nAs a special note, I love the music they play there. I never imagined I'd get to have lunch on my birthday and hear Third Uncle by Bauhaus come on over the radio. The stars truly do align sometimes!",

I guess I should have put some extra sauce on my sandwich. The french fries were crispy and flavorful.\n\nMy husband got a brisket sandwich on brioche toast with mozzarella cheese, a side of cole slaw and an order of dry rub wings. The brisket was so fatty that my husband left most of the sandwich uneaten. The cole slaw was tasty but the dry rub wings were overcooked and dry.

  "text": "Come for the food, tolerate the service.\n\nMuriel's wasn't our first choice, but it was a convenient choice. Wanting to do a fun, french quarter brunch with the family on Sunday, we decided to trek in from Arabi to try and get a spot at Stanley's. Unfortunately, Stanley's does not take reservations and had a 2 hour wait at 1:00 for brunch. Hungry and lacking patience, we sidestepped our way over to Muriel's Jackson Square.\n\nFirst, let me talk about one of the highlights of our experience. The building itself is fantastico. There are beautiful sky lights that let sunshine just pour into the restaurant. This is a plus. Unsurprisingly, the bar is in a dark, dank corner that was a high-traffic area. Meaning, if you weren't sitting down at the bar, servers were jostling their way by you every few minutes.\n\nThe wait caused us to hang out at the dark, dank, not so happy bar area.\n\nNow, hanging out at this bar wouldn't have been so bad if the service were a little better. Ordering drinks for our group proved to be a herculean task. Both my cousin and my wife tried numerous times to get the attention of the two bartenders, one who was working quickly, the other who was working like she could care less that she was there. Time after time, the bartenders would look passed the younger, less wealthy looking women and instead, take the orders of older patrons. My cousin was even on the end of a snide comment by one of the bartenders. Eventually, we received our drinks. The verdict? Good, but not worth the wait.\n\nBy the time we got our drinks, almost 45 minutes after sitting at the bar, it was time to take our seats. At this point, the service improved marginally. Our drink guy was friendly and quick to take our drink orders. Our waitress (I'm unsure if she even bothered to introduce herself) was a bit awkward. So what saves this place? The food. The brunch food was damn good. I got the Imperial Crab as an appetizer, which had tons of crab meat and a light breading, and the shrimp and grits as my main. The crab was moist, hot, and just downright tasty. The shrimp and grits were also well above average, with the grits being some of the best grits I have ever had. My wife ordered a bacon/cheese tart type of thing that was also quite good, especially when paired with the fresh fruit. 2-star service is rescued by 4-star food. \n\nThe service issues just got more awkward during the bill. We had split the check three ways (that is their limit), so my friend was on my tab with my wife. He put down $40 to cover his meal, and we put the rest on the credit card. Our waitress? Despite the fact that we split our check, she assumed the $40 was the tip for the entire table. We then had to awkwardly tell her that no, that was to be applied toward the bill. We tipped on the card. If I hadn't caught this snafu, we would have paid $40 more than we intended to. \n\nConsensus: I'd go back, but only if I was getting takeout.",

Let's take a look at the fish you ordered Eli, how many of those fish  came off the docks in Lawndale? Wait Lawndale doesn't have docks, but regardless, looks like none to maybe one, so that awesome sushi you're eating in Lawndale, is yes, wait for it..the same freaking fish flown in! You see, they have these things called planes now, what they do is, they load a plane to a glitzy metropolis called Lawndale and another for St Louis. Our plane probably arrives a few hours later, so you do have us there.  Some of the best sushi restaurants are in NYC (I've been to this magical place) and guess what pal, they ain't pulling those fish out of the Hudson River.\n\nTo be fair, I have no basis on Lawndale sushi, because I have never been to Lawndale, let alone hear of Lawndale. I work in Santa Monica some times, perhaps I will avoid those places to try the magical Lawndale Sushi that tastes like you're eating it out of Zeus' butthole.\n\nPerhaps you can bring that cool yellow hat, I am very interested in it as my sister loved Strawberry Shortcake and it seems you shop at the same hat shop as her. I guess it must be a California store.",

Our waitress informed us that full breakfast would not be available until 9:00. The music was insanely loud until about 8:30, when they turned it down. We were the only 3 people there for a while, so perhaps the music was up loud for the employees to enjoy? We could barely hear each other talk, and it was way too early for that loud of music for me. The coffee, however, was phenomenal. It was definitely the best, most fresh, and most balanced coffee I have ever had from anywhere. I made plans to stop by on my way to Lilly to grab a coffee some morning. The pastries were very unique. I am not too adventurous when it comes to food, so I'm probably not the best judge of the overall menu, but I really liked the tres leche pastry - bread pudding and beer. Very sweet and lightly tangy. From glancing at the breakfast menu, it was a little weird for my tastes, but again, I am conservative when it comes to food. I will definitely try to swing by and grab a coffee to go sometime, but I don't plan to try and eat in here anytime soon.",

  "text": "Moto attempts to bring modern Italian cooking to Nashville. Unfortunately the food is underwhelming and poorly cooked. \n\nEach dish we tried had something off about it. \n\nThe Calamari was over-breaded and served with tartar sauce. The tartar sauce must have been inspired by the time Rome invaded Great Britain . I'm pretty sure tartar sauce is not an italian specialty. \n\nThe Burata was flavorful once it warmed up. It was pre-plated and stored in the refrigerator making it too cold until it sat a bit.  The cold also made the croutons unappetizing. \n\nThe Black Spaghetti was oily and had very little lobster. Three small pieces, less than 2oz.\n\nThe Chicken Piccata was bathed in butter,  drowning out any lemon flavor.\n\nThe Polenta fries were too salty to eat. \n\nThe waiter was professional, and was very helpful pointing point out that Mozzarella was a \"cheese\". Oh yes, Gotcha. \n\nPerhaps the main chef left for the night and the sous chef was filling in. It was 1015pm on a Saturday and empty. And no, they were not playing The Cure. \n\nOn an up note, the wine list was great and the service was quick and friendly. \n\nMy suggestion, pass on Moto and try Coco's or City House.",

I have made it a mission to try the best donuts wherever I travel - this does in fact seem to be the best spot in New Orleans - but they just didn't stack up to what I've had in DC, New York, or Chicago. I do think this place must have really good food outside of the donuts - it smelled very good. The staff was also very friendly.\n\nOne thing that was also a turn off was that they offered a passion and cocoa nib donut - this is a flavor combo that Dough in NYC is famous for.

  "text": "Came during lunch on a Friday. \nWe were allowed to sit immediately which was a good sign. However, a very large group was using their back private area therefore the available tables in the front room were very deceiving to the expected wait times. Waves and waves of plates were taken to this apparently huge group in the back before we realized what was going on. This of course led to us waiting almost an hour for our two plates. In a properly run establishment the decision should be made to not allow more and more patrons to take a seat and order until a reasonable wait time is to be expected. We would have even been ok with them having given us a warning as we sat that wait times were going to be much longer than expected. Very easy step to take. The servers were clearly overworked due to managements bonehead decision to allow customers to continue to sit. \nEventually our food did come but it wasn't worth an hour wait. We wanted to like this, but bad customer flow management left a bad taste in my mouth.\n \nSuper Easy fix guys! Don't seat people when the wait is going to be that long.",

I like the atmosphere of the place.  It had a nice setting but it wasn't pretentious.  There were all sorts of people there which is always nice. The service was great!  Our waitress was attentive and gave great recommendations.  \n\nNow the food:\nThe fresh oysters were delicious.  I've never had them before and am still on the fence about it overall, but I'll admit they were pretty fresh tasting.  My parents loved it since my mom food orgasm-ed pretty loudly with every bite (pretty gross if you ask me).  I especially like that they had some sort of a wasabi sauce that went with it. \n\nI ordered the etouffee, which was good but it wasn't really anything to write home about.  My mom had the shrimp and grits, which I thought were fantastic but she thought was way too salty.  My dad had the express meal (Sunday was some veal dish with a cup of crab & corn soup).  The soup was really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of the red sauce base and this was kind of in between.  He said he like the veal dish but he will also eat anything and is a man of little to no words - so take that however you want.\n\nOverall, I liked the food and the ambiance of the place.  I was a little disappointed to see that for the price, the portions were tiny.  I know \"nicer\" restaurants always have smaller portions, but still, I guess I like having yummy leftovers.  I think I'd come back here but maybe try some of the other dishes and definitely to try those oysters.",

Let's just say there is no comparison to the glitz and glamour of Vegas, so let's just stop doing that, ok?\n\nFor a Tucson, AZ casino, this is where it's at. They have a nicer new hotel and several restaurants. Their pool could stand to be kid-free, but it is still nice. As for gambling, they do have a nice selection of new slots and a bunch of tables. I have never had to wait to play.\n\nI have been to this casino several times, most recent being last night. A few friends and I have gone there to play bingo for their Thursday night Club Sol appreciation night. Thursday nights you get 20% off bingo with your Club Sol Card. To get a Club Sol card you just go to card services, show them your id, and you get a free card. Each time you go to the casino, you can enter into contests by just sliding your card at the kiosks, and you get rewards points and discounts. When I signed up, I also got $10.00 in free play. yay!\n\nBingo is fun, there are always a lot of people, be sure to sit in the non-smoking section if you don't care to get lung cancer. This plays fills up, so get there early. There are complimentary soft drinks, and also a snack bar with some baseball-like concessions.\n\nI have stayed at the hotel before, our Ad2 Tucson organization held our ADstravaganza event there a couple of years ago. The event staff did an outstanding job and we loved the space by the pool. We stayed over night, it was nice, but probably not the nicest place in Tucson if you are looking to relax. It was pretty loud, and if I hadn't have passed out from drinking, I might have had a problem.\n\nI have also eaten at the PY Steakhouse, which I will review separately.",

Our server was incredibly attentive, constantly checking on our large group (ended up tipping more than the already included gratuity). For appetizers, the prosciutto wrapped artichokes were the best I've ever had, and my girlfriend's tomato and mozzarella caprese was exceptional. \n\nFor our main entree the salmon over spinach and potatoes was fantastic- fish was cooked perfectly and the accented vegetables went well with the salmon. The gnocchi was always class! Portions were huge- our friend's veal parm was enormous and also delicious!\n\nThe cannoli was just ok, but the sundae on the restaurant week menu was delicious. Paired with good coffee and complimentary limoncello (a bit too strong but it was complimentary) it was a great way to end the meal. \n\nWould definitely recommend! They even comp your parking!",

The potato salad was great, but he would try something other than the peas next time. I had the one meat platter with pulled pork - it had a nice smoky flavor - worth ordering again. For sides, I had the maque choux mac and cheese - unique with great kick, and the coleslaw - a good option. We redeemed the Yelp check-in special and thoroughly enjoyed the free cheese fries - very cheesy with good texture.

The blackjack tables have a sidebet called 'straight jack' which is fun to play (though I wouldn't recommend putting more than one dollar on the side bet for every five on the main bet, it isn't cost efficient).

  "text": "Cool brewery right down the road from my house!\n\nI was excited to see this place go in as one of the first restaurants on McEwen.  I was impressed on my first visit.  The beer was great and the food was excellent.  It also has a very nice look on the inside.  It's a bit dressy, but you can get away with dressing casual.\n\nIt is a bit pricey, however.  It's certainly too much to be a regular place for my wife and I.  However, I have been a few times and I've enjoyed everything I've tried on the menu--from pasta to steak.  They have a quality menu.\n\nThe beer is better than I expected.  I'm a bit of a sucker for browns and they have some excellent selections in this category.  They have an rich taste and are very well crafted.  The beer here is top notch, especially for a micro-brew.\n\nFor me, Granite City is a nice spot.  It isn't a place where I would just stop in after having the \"Where do you want to go for dinner?\" conversation.  You can certainly get away with going casual, but it is a bit nicer than the average restaurant.  I am interested to see how their beer selection evolves.  I think they're off to a great start!",

  "text": "I'm calling this place the \"La Colombe\" of hummus. Like LC, this place takes you on a culinary tour of Lebanon and Turkey. The flavors are beyond fresh and unique. They're totally in a league of their own! \n\nThe menu is slightly overwhelming, so I defaulted to the original hummus and green salad. The original hummus is soft and nutty just like Zahav/Dizengoff (sorry to pull so many restaurants into this, but I think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality Suraya meets). I blame that on the tehina, Soom Foods. It is served with a pita, fresh from the oven, and it's soft and airy with a subtle crust. The green salad included gem lettuce, raw fennel, watermelon radishes, a soft-boiled egg, yogurt dressing, and pita chips. The flavor profile was satisfying. The meal overall was light, filling, and nourishing! \n\nI went back for seconds the week after. Opted for the baba ganoush, pita, and the rest of the party got the gravlax. Overall, everyone was satisfied. While the ganoush was tasty, I think I'll stick to the hummus. I appreciate that particular spread much more.  \n\nAgain, service and atmosphere were 10/10!",

  "text": "It can be intimidating when first arriving but don't let that stop you. Coat check and initial entrance are on the first floor. You walk down a corridor to the elevator and ride all the way to the top floor of the building. It's low lighting so pictures might be hard but it's a super trendy and hip atmosphere. More on the lounge side. Lighting is probably to make it seem more intimate. \n\nThe view! Omg, the view of Philadelphia is amazing and totally worth it! \n\nThe food is absolutely fantastic. Very pricey but totally worth it. \n\nI had the spare ribs with roasted carrots and potatoes. My husband had the tuna with a poached egg and a delicious clam sauce. We shared fries dipped first in the mayo sauce and then dipped in house steak sauce. Delicious! We cleaned our entire plates! I'd like to note that the ribs are first braised which makes them tender and slow cooked and then they are grilled. Grilling helps hold the meat together. From a culinary aspect, the texture is easier to cut and hold together on a fork which makes eating much easier. Just braised would be delicious but fall apart which means you'd need a spoon rather than a fork to pick it up. \n\nDessert we ordered the toasted cinnamon crunch. My husband had to have it because of the Krispy Kreme donuts used to make the ice cream. It was accompanied by some crunchy cinnamon brioche bits, toasted hazelnuts, and some sort of cinnamon whipped dollops.  Overall, delicious. Very sweet. \n\nI was disappointed there wasn't a single chocolate dessert option other than a chocolate sorbet. \n\nWe loved every minute, ate every bite! Soooooo delicious. For all that  our bill was just under $90. Again, pricey but worth it since this was our special dinner while visiting Philly. \n\nAttire: men were in suits and jackets. The ladies were in pants, dresses, and heels. You can totally wear jeans as I did but I would recommend classing it up with heels or dress shoes.",

The tree growing \"through\" the wall was pretty awesome.  The place is pretty small - basically a bar with some tables in front, back, and along the sides. \n\nService was solid, the waitress recommended some good drinks off of their extensive cocktail menu.  I'm not a cocktail pro, but I thought they were delicious and well made.  Our waitress actually recommended many of the \"classic\" cocktails over the ones on the menu.  My advice would be to discuss what you like with the bartenders/servers and let them make appropriate recommendations.  \n\nThe food was good, we had a full dinner here, but I think most people are heading to Libertine for the drinks and atmosphere.  I haven't been to the Ball & Biscuit yet, so I can't compare it to that, but I thought it held its own with many of the well-known Chicago cocktail bars (Whistler, Violet Hour).  A great spot in downtown Indy worth checking out.",

  "text": "The newest vessel in St. Elmo's fleet, they had a sign on the sidewalk. It read \"be our guest, put our burgers to the test\", so we did; and we were less than impressed.  Everything was OK, but it was just OK, and I guess I had higher expectations from the offspring of such infamous ancestry.  We started off with the blistered Shishito peppers with sesame ponzu on the side which are an appetizer; but alone there just really isn't much to it.  The peppers actually gave a little flavor to our burgers. Although the burger styles are creative, they just didn't seem to have much flavor.  We had the lamb and the homecoming burger.  Both were ordered medium well and came out what seemed to me more medium rare.  We didn't send it back, which is on us because we were short on time, but I feel it should have been prepared to our order.  The homecoming had the root beer glazed bacon, but it was just two very small half strips that were too small to lend any flavor.  All of us liked the cucumber tomato salad. We truly enjoyed the Bourbon milkshake with the Eagle Reserve poured table side.  Our server was fantastic.  Considering the plethora of burger options in the city and the menu is in St. Elmo fashion, al a carte and pricey, I just think the final impression and the quality fall short for the price tag.",

It came with a mushroom risotto which had a good flavor but was slightly undercooked.\nMy husband had the filet which melted in your mouth... Excellent!",

  "text": "My family was out celebrating my sisters birthday and decided to give Michas a try as our company frequently caters from them and it's generally decent then. The inside is very unassuming, pretty humble and low key with some nice art on the walls. \n\nThe salsa here is decent and the food solid. I did really like the carne asada, it was actual steak. Too many Mexican places around town use tasteless, odorless brown beef nuggets. We also ordered a pitcher of margaritas that was pretty run of the mill flavor wise but kinda lacking in the tequila department, tons of mixer in this one. The enchiladas, beans, and rice were all solid Mexican faire but nothing I'd go out of my way for. My favorite item here was definitely the carne asada. \n\nService started out strong but ended up being the downfall of our entire visit. Upon arriving we were seated pretty quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. Service was quick all the way through ordering and getting our food, at which point flagging down our server was nearly impossible. It took us 15 minutes after asking for the check to actually get it. \n\nOnce we gave a card to process payment, we ended up waiting another 15+ minutes at which point I got up to check on progress to see the cashier boy texting away on his phone with our card sitting at the counter. When I got his attention he mentioned he needed an ID to be able to run the card. I asked how we would ever have found that out, to which his response was \"idk I guess we're busy\". They were less than half as busy as when we arrived and service was stellar. For future reference, if you could just acknowledge that the mistake was on your end and not make some lame excuse deflecting responsibility for it, I think I would've walked away feeling a little better about this place. All I've gathered from this is that the staff don't care, which doesn't give me much confidence in this place. \n\nThe food here is solid, acceptable Mexican food. Portion sizes are large enough to satisfy any appetite but in a city full of amazing Mexican food Michas is just not worth the effort. I'll stick to getting my fix of this place when it's catered to my office.",

  "text": "I've been here twice. It's definitely a welcome addition to the Northeast and BYOB is always a plus. The decor is nice and the staff is friendly. My issue is the portion size for the price point. \n\n1 - My first time I ordered the scallops and for $18 you get 4 scallops and about two or three tablespoons of lentils. Nothing else on the plate. I was definitely still very hungry so I sampled what was leftover from appetizers, my friends general tso wings, which were okay. Tasty, but nothing special. The accompaniments to the wings were just blah. I ended up leaving this night very hungry. \n\n2 - I decided there were enough positives to give it one more try. My second visit I ordered the sweet potato gnocci $16 and my friend ordered the duck sandwich. I wish I would have counted, however there may have been 8-12 gnocci on my plate max. It looked like less of a portion than an appetizer. I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I've ordered gnocci and not needed a to-go box. I knew immediately I was still going to be hungry. The flavor, however, was very good.\n\nMy friend was equally unsatisfied with his duck sandwich. It was about  half a sandwich size and did not come with anything on the side. For dinner you would expect a sandwich to have something, anything on the side. I felt bad for him and offered some of my gnocci, which we joked about. We both left still hungry and after paying we decided that we had to hit another spot on the way home in order to get some satisfying food. I know this sounds silly, but we are fit people used to dining in all types of establishments, most often downtown and due to the portion sizes and price point at the Blue Duck we will not be back for a third time. \n\nIf I hear they've made improvements in those two areas I would consider returning because they are on to something with their flavor pairings.",

This is a successful fast food vegan establishment, yet it is not my favorite,  In an increasingly crowded market of health fast-food dining options in Philadelphia, Hip City Veg does some things well and other things not so well.  I do like their Udon noodle salad but in my mind there is much too much arugula and too little of the other tasty ingredients be they peanuts, chicken substitute, daikon, scallions or even udon itself. for the price. It would more accurately be named an arugula salad.  There are absolutely no condiments out for people to use.  Aww c'mon guys!  I did ask and received a little Sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit.  The sweet potato fries are good but again the portion is small in relation to the price in my opinion. There is free water which is nice to have.  At the University City location the staff are friendly and it's kept clean.",

  "text": "We went here with another couple for dinner. It is a nice addition to the neighborhood. The food was traditional pub fare. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. My friend had a salad with ahi tuna. The tuna was sliced very thick for a salad portion but otherwise was good. I had fish tacos. They were tasty but the fish was a little dry. My husband had a cubano sandwich that he loved. Our other friend ordered a salad which he said was very good. He ordered his dressing on the side. He asked for a little more dressing as it only came with one small cup. The waitress immediately brought another cup over. At the end of the evening we noticed we were charged .69 cents for the additional dressing. This was surprising and disappointing. Overall it was a favorable experience but the restaurant has a few kinks to iron out and should not charge for a little extra dressing for a salad.",

  "text": "Beer - 5 stars.   Crooked is putting together a great beer selection. \n\nRestaurant decor and vibe - 5 stars.   Our group really enjoyed the layout and feel of the restaurant. The place is huge! \n\nFood - 2 stars unfortunately.   Three of the three plates arrived with cold food.   The chicken in two of the plates seemed to be reheated frozen chicken.   The chicken strips were very uniform in cut and color to be fresh it seemed..... and were cold.   It surprises me that QDoba, Baja Fresh,  and Chipotle can serve fresh hot chicken as fast food restaurants but Crooked struggled.   I do realize the kitchen is still young and working out the kinks,  but delivering cold bland chicken should be fixed within the first few days of opening. \nThe French Fries get 4 stars.   They are very tasty and crispy.   They arrived warm.\nI recommend The Barrelhouse for a great place for beer but have not been sold on the food part. We well definitely be back with hopes of improvements from the kitchen.",

I also got the Madras latte and I loved it. Ever since, I've been driving out of my way just to drive to Mt. Juliet whenever I get my Indian food cravings. I have tried other Indian food from this place and they do not compare. The only negative comment I have is that their customer service is not the best and is inconsistent at times. Overall I recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Indian food.",

  "text": "The Cunningham Restaurant Group has taken the Indy food scene by storm, and they never fail to please. Due to the diversity of offerings, comparing one of their restaurants to another is a welcomed impossibility.  Livery, the newest addition to the company's line of exquisite eateries, is certainly their most unique.  \n\nHoused in the old Indianapolis Police Department Horse Livery, the Cunningham Restaurant Group puts a modern and hip twist on a historic building.  Livery is a gorgeous restaurant.  While certainly an establishment of class, it fails at being pretentious.  The atmosphere is relaxed, and with its two-levels of dining space and beautiful patio, the diner will never be uncomfortable.  Even if one is forced to wait for a table, which, with the Livery's popularity, is certainly a possibility, pausing at one of the restaurant's two bars is sure to bolster the appetite.\n\nThe toughest decision one will make at Livery is what to order.  The Latin American-inspired menu caters to solo and group diners alike.  With many small plate options, no one is forced - or even tempted to choose just one item.  That wouldn't be any fun.  I suggest going big, going all-out, and having a damn good time doing it.  I started with the yuca fries, the chorizo empanada, street corn, ribs & jicama, and ceviche.  Clearly, I did not eat all of this by myself - but I was tempted.  The yuca fries, coupled with Chihuahua cheese, were absolutely delectable.  Don't dine at Livery without getting an order.  The chorizo empanada, hearty and piping hot, nearly made me lose my inhibitions (i.e. not share them). The ribs and jicama were quite tender - and how 'bout that barbecue sauce? Mmm..mmm..mmm.  They were so good that once the plate was passed to me, I only got to eat one-half of a rib; it's all Livery's fault.\n\nMy second course included the the chile relleno and the pork pastor.  The chile relleno, like everything else, was terrific.  The Chihuahua cheese, as with the yuca fries, really tied the dish together.  The couscous innards put a special North African twist on a popular Mexican dish. The pork pastor was truly magnificent. The piquant blend of flavors from the pork, pineapple, onion, and cabbage makes this the most interesting item on the menu. Next time, I'm getting an order all to myself.\n\nI always save the best for last: dessert.  There is absolutely no reason to ever skip it, especially when dining at Livery.  The churros.  The churros.  The churros...fried, sweet, and as delicious as \"delicious\" can get.  I am guilty of licking the plate clean.  Since the kitchen and bar stay open late, Livery is a wonderful spot for dessert and after-dinner drinks.\n\nAs with any other restaurant in the Cunningham Restaurant Group's portfolio, the service at Livery is superior.  Our particular server was personable, well-versed on the menu, and speedy.  Given how busy he was with other guests, I felt his efforts were worthy of note.\n\nLivery is a five-star experience.  It is a restaurant that does not have to put on airs to impress its guests, and I highly recommend it.",

The coffee is good (middle of the pack in this neighbourhood) and the food smells great, but I guess I don't thing of it as a restaurant and generally I'm not there at meal times.\n\nOur typical time at Remedy is spent talking over a coffee, beer or chai.  It's got a more relaxed atmosphere than the nearby Sugar Bowl and I'd say a more Bohemian vibe than the hipster scene across the street.  It's more conducive to visiting and conversation in the evenings.\n\nThis end of 109 is getting to be quite the evening spot.  There are a couple of sushi spots, a couple of diners, a couple of espresso cafes, a really decent pho place, and with Sugar Bowl and Remedy you can stretch the evening out with drinks and coffee (along with Indian food) before popping into the Garneau for some Art House.",

I didn't care too much for the crinkle fries - I've made better from a frozen bag at home. I requested a side of their horseradish chipotle dip (or Texas sauce) and it was a great dipper for the shrimpies. Mom's salad was good too, albeit very simple. One thing though - it is a pet peeve of mine when restaurants do not remove the stems from the spinach leaves. The bacon vinaigrette was very tasty!!  Overall, this place isn't extraordinary but a good local alternative to the hooters or bubba gumps, and other chain restaurants.",

Very good kids menu as well, - Mac n cheese was excellent.

The menu looked delicious so we wanted to try it anyway. We waitrd a while for our food. Everything stuck to the bar and floor. The bathroom was disgusting. I watched meals sit up in the window with flies visiting them but not picked up for over 10min. My husband offered to take me somewhere else 3 times but I really wanted to give the food a try. My omelette was completely overcooked with the eggs dry and the veggies burnt. My husband's eggs benedict was also completely over-cooked and the grits were bland.

For dinner, we ordered the black spaghetti pasta which had just a hint of lobster. It was incredibly unique and tasted very different than any pasta dish I'd had previously. The lobster was not overpowering and was a wise addition for this classic. We also ordered the market fish. It was well done and expertly paired with sides. Would attend this restaurant again for special occasions.",

How can you pass that up in this town?  I couldn't and made the quick two block walk there.  I sat at the bar and downed a dozen oysters pretty quick.  I also had one of the most delicious beers; a NOLA Blond Ale, and it was so cold  (and it was so hot outside) that I wanted to jump in it, but I drank it instead!  The oysters were great, and then I had a Shrimp PoBoy, which turned out to be a little much.  I couldn't eat the bread on this sandwich, so I just ate the fixin's.  Another NOLA, and by the time I was done, I was DONE!\n\nYou may find me back here again tomorrow night, grabbing another dozen oysters, before heading out into the French Quarter for adventures unknown...",

  "text": "Coco's Cocina is right across the street from the Broadway Theatre of Pitman and next to Sweet Lula's, a nice, traditional Italian restaurant owned by the same couple. But you really don't need these directions. You'll easily find Coco's while driving down the street. You can't miss the glamorous, flashy, bright red signage. It's right in the heart of town.\n\nWalk in to find a BYO, seat-yourself establishment and offers a seriously affordable menu. Chips and salsa, or guac, or queso, run about $4. All entrees (regular or wet burritos, tacos any style,  quesadillas, etc., with preferred protein/veg) are $9 and come with rice and your choice of pinto or refried beans. Keep in mind it IS \"Tex-Mex\" in that nothing is overly spicy; therefore, it is a good eatery for folks who don't mix it up much with their diets or want a \"tame\" meal. You can add hot sauce, however.\n\nThe vibe inside is very relaxed with a good number of tables and a food truck mural with a window that peeks into the kitchen. A jingle rings each time food is sitting and ready to be served. Mexican sodas, regular fountain pours, and virgin margaritas are available as drink options.\n\nSo originally here (before writing all that basic info), I included the long story of the visit with my mom from earlier this week. But it bored me so I deleted it. Basically the experience culminated with owner/chef/puppeteer/entertainer Anthony Asbury sitting at our table coaxing her to eat churros for the first time. It was hilarious but probably one of those \"you had to be there\" moments. But I will say that both owners are super friendly/funny/accommodating, and those qualities clearly align with their effective business operations.\n\nMy mom and I split the chips and queso app to start. Both the chips and the dip were delicious. No kick. If you want queso with a kick, go down the street to the other Mexican spot in town.\n\nFor my meal, I had the chicken tinga quesadilla. Again, no kick, nothing fancy, but just good, gooey toasted tortilla with chicken. The addition of sour cream with lettuce on the side was nice. I also really enjoyed my rice and would probably ask to get two sides of it instead of the beans in the future.\n\nMy mom had the pork carnitas tacos. The entree comes with three, and you get your choice of shell. She went with crispy, and liked them. As mentioned, she also had the churros (with Jack Daniel's bourbon butterscotch sauce) and ate them all rather quickly despite complaints of them being \"too hot.\" I had a bite and would definitely save more room for them in the future.\n\nI really enjoyed my first visit to this new spot in Pitman. It's good for any occasion and will likely hold a spot in my take-out rotation.",

  "text": "I ate at Rotten Ralph's on Sunday, February 21, and I cannot explain how much I regret it. I can confidently say that this is absolutely one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in my LIFE.  The experience was unsatisfactory from beginning to end and I can honestly say that I have never been so disrespected in my life as a customer.  We sat upstairs and our waitress (some girl who seemed out of it with short, mousy brown hair and an enormous attitude) was rude to begin with, then proceeded to take 10 minutes to bring our drinks and ended up messing up our order.  My sister and I specifically ordered eggplant parmesan, which the waitress must have repeated back to us 4 times.  She then brought us chicken parmesan, and as she handed it to us she said, \"here's your chicken parmesan\" So of course I said, \"this is chicken? I ordered eggplant, remember?\" and she said \"I'm sorry, you're right, it's eggplant\".  As a trusting customer, I took her at her word and began to eat my food, which was in fact CHICKEN! My sister was upset, but could deal.  I on the other hand am a strict vegetarian and have not eaten meat in over 10 years. Until that night. I was furious at this careless waitress and of course did not eat anything.  We then explained to the girl what she had done and asked politely for her to take the chicken parmesan's off our check.  She rudely told us  that we had to wait for her manager, who was at the store.  We waited for 10 minutes and when we couldn't wait any longer due to the fact that we had somewhere else to be and were already running late because of her mistake, we said \"can you please just fix this and explain to your manager later?\".  At this point, the waitress and another waitress who was standing with her became extremely inappropriate, telling us they won't help us, it's our problem, and leave if we can't wait.  This type of shocking exchange continued until the manager finally showed up a few minutes later.  He was just as rude, telling us \"fine, what do you want me to do, take the chicken parms off your bill? Fine then.\"  As he was bombarding us with HIS rudeness, his two waitresses were standing behind him, staring us down and mouthing at my mother and sister and I the word \"b****\" over and over again! Obviously we were completely shocked and when we told him what they were doing, he DENIED that they would do that and said we were out of line for suggesting such a thing! He then proceeded to say to my sister and mother and I, \"ladies, leave this to the men to handle (my father was there as well), you are obviously incapable of dealing\".  There was no getting through to these exceptionally RUDE individuals.  I will write a negative review on every single website I can and I will call the local newspapers, and Better Business Bureau, etc.  If I could give this place negative stars I would.  Their staff is disrespectful, they are insolent and no one in their right mind should support them. Hey, at least they stay true to their name.  Rotten Ralph's is indeed employing ROTTEN employees, making for quite the ROTTEN experience.",

  "text": "Returned for happy hour, and was not disappointed. Word seems to have gotten out, so best make a reservation. Happy hour oysters are fresh, cold, and the perfect size raw(and the perfect price at 50¢.) The fried oysters are also worth the price at $1 apiece, and are so flavorful that you could skip the sauce if you wanted(but that is excellent, as well.) Drinks are half price(I get the River Bend...Okay, I got 3,) which is a really good deal for a craft cocktail at under $5. Another favorite is the salad Luke; I'm not a salad eater, but the beets are spectacularly sweet, the lettuce is actually beautiful, and it's dressed just right. The servers are really friendly/personable and attentive(our guy switched a wobbly table for us even though we didn't ask or complain,) and they even check on you to let you know that it's getting close to the end of happy hour, so you can get in more orders at the special prices. The only people that are a little lacking are the girls at the front; they always look us up and down and make me as if we need to pass inspection, but once you've been seated, the rest of the experience is wonderful. This will be one of my regular places to eat during oyster season. Just don't tell too many people, b/c it's getting awfully crowded.",

  "text": "Came here early on a Friday night; it was not too crowded.  If you sit inside, the tables are communal so you may be tight on elbow room.  There are also counters.  We ordered the melanzana pizza and the italian caesar salad. The pizza was soggy. When you lifted a slice off by the crust (as you normally would when eating pizza) all the toppings slide off.  It was disappointing.  The flavors were good; but the sogginess of the pie made me wonder how come this place has gotten such rave reviews.  I looked around and the other diners appeared to have non-soggy pizza.  They were actually holding the crust and biting into the pizza, whereas we were scooping our toppings off the plate.  So perhaps it is just this style of pizza that needs help.  I don't know.  I suspect that the pizza was made beforehand; dough rolled out too thin.  The soggy part of the pizza was also cold.  I'm definitely not coming back and actually would have given this place 1 star, but the waiter was nice and when we mentioned they could improve their soggy pizza they offered us a complimentary soft serve.  That was delicious, but not enough to change my mind about coming back for the pizza.  Also, there were egg shells in our salad.  So overall I question the quality of the food here.",

This time I decided to go for and It was around 6 PM when I came in, customer service is OK, but food was the worst ever. I ordered a popular meal that is kind of a standard in every Chinese restaurant, yet they screwed it up. I had to throw it away. \n\nIt was digusting. Fried rice is not good at all and seemed pretty old. They do not seem very clean and obviously hide the kitchen so no body sees their mess. Plus they charge more for the meal than other restaurants around do. Not expensive, but do charge more. With the crappy food, they should be out of business.

Two of us arrived for a 6:30 reservation at 6:25.  We were immediately seated, our bottle of wine opened, and placed our order.  We had a nice sushi dinner and then payed the check.  Immediately after we paid the check, we were approached by the waitress and told we needed to leave as there were others waiting for tables.  This was at 7:15.  We were not even at our table to for an hour and had the last of our bottle of wine in our glasses to finish.  I have never been kicked out of a restaurant before.  I couldn't even fathom being asked to give up our table.  I could see if we had been there for a bowl of soup and kept the table for 2 hours.  But we had dinner for 2 in under an hour and were asked to leave.  I asked to speak to the manager or the owner, but was told he was in back cooking and was not available.  We left our full glasses of wine on the table and I approached the front on the way out and asked again to speak to a manager or owner.  I was told the waitress was the manager and the only person I could talk to.  We let her know again that we had never been treated this way in a restaurant and would not be back.  We also informed her that we would be sharing this information on Yelp so others will know that they should be prepared to be evicted if they plan to stay longer than an hour.",

Great taste with several different flavors which all seemed to work well together. The only slight downside was the portion size was a bit on the small side for the price. \n\nThe number of selections on the menu were a not as plentiful as most other places however from what I recall in previous visits, they seem to rotate the entire menu frequently. If that is the case then I feel the limited selections are a plus as it not only allows someone as indecisive as myself make a choice within the hour but encourages you to maybe try something you might not ordinarily and also perhaps intrigue you to come back again to check out the new selections :-)",

Amazing if you are a horseradish fan, like me!\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is comfortable and the food is great.  However, I couldn't go higher than 3 stars due to some service issues.\nI have been here twice:\n\nThe first time was in the summer.  We were seated upstairs and over the course of our meal, the temperature rose well into the 80s.  When we mentioned it to the staff they stated that their cooling system was integrated with the mall, so they could not control it and there was nothing they could do.  Needless to say, what would have been an amazing dining experience turned out to be pretty hot, sticky and miserable.  To be fair, by dessert, they were able to move our party down to the bar area, where it was 15 degrees cooler.\n\nThe second time was during the winter, and overall, it was fine with one minor exception - our entrees were brought our before we finished our salads.  I realize this is nit-picky, but when I am paying what we paid to eat here, I expect top-notch service, so those little annoyances make a difference.\n\nOn the whole, though, I like it and I would certainly go back.",

For my combo I chose the fried clam strips, garlic shrimp scampi, and the mashed potatoes. I loved the fried clam strips. The shrimp scampi had a decent garlic flavor but I felt it was a little greasy. The mashed potatoes had a good flavor and if they were hot would have been perfect.  My lunch date ordered the Asian glazed salmon. He loved it. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say the best thing going here is the Cheddar Bay Biscuits. They are a bit salty but really good.

The food was good but a couple of the waitresses just don't look happy to be there and we didn't get one smile from either of them the entire time. I've been a waitress, I understand it can be a tough job and maybe not what you want to be doing on a Sunday but customer service still really matters. There was a guy there who was really nice and friendly but unfortunately the 2 women bring down the vibe of the place. Sad because I really wanted to like it. It's a very cute, cozy place with antique looking toys for kids and a good menu, but like I said, it just didn't vibe for us. Definitely worth giving it a try and hopefully you'll have a different experience!",

For a Monday night, it was pretty slow but I still opted to sit and have dinner at the bar because the two girls working were so friendly.\n\nI started with the Wild Flower and Above the Clouds cocktails and both were tasty. They are the kind of drinks that go down really quick (especially the Wild Flower with the big ice cubes ) but will sneak up on you after a few.\n\nMy starter was the Brussel Sprout Caesar salad. That dish was just ehhhh - I'd recommend trying a different salad as the dressing was bland. My colleague got the calamari and said it was tasty.\n\nMy main course was the Gnudi ricotta pasta... freaking AMAZING. The portion isn't super big but it's a dense pasta and will fill you up just perfectly. I also tried my friends EGG pizza with truffle oil, mushrooms and onions.  The wood fire taste in the crust with the savory truffle flavor was really interesting. \n\nAll in all, it was a great low key, casual spot with a good vibes only!",

They have a few decently priced lunch specials, so that usually brought us in. \n\nThe big problem for me is that the service really is slow, which means it isn't an ideal location when you're on a set lunch break. I don't think I've ever had a truly attentive waitress, especially when I have dined upstairs.\n\nAs for the food, it's pretty standard bar fare. I do like their meatball sub, and the chicken tenders are decent. However, I can't say I ever get an urge to go there. It's more like, \"yeah, I guess we can go to Rotten Ralph's\".",

We had a reservation and the were seated as soon as we entered the restaurant. We all opted for the Table D'hote Menu. I had the shrimp and grits and oh my goodness was it  good. I have never been a fan of grits, but the grit cake and the perfectly cooked shrimp were delicious. The flourless chocolate cake was so good but very rich. I could only take a couple of bites,because it was a little too rich for me. The atmosphere was great and that made it an excellent place to celebrate a birthday with friends.",

We ordered 4 rolls, noodles, fried rice and chicken kabobs and surprisingly we got everything in less than 10 minutes! I had prepared my husband for a long wait and we were pleasantly surprised when our food showed up so fast. But that is where my good experience ended.\nThe sushi was okay...we ordered emperial guard, sexy girl and Hurricane roll. My favorite was the sexy girl. The emperial guard's presentation was good and our son was very happy to see it, but it did not taste that good.\nAs for the rice, I couldn't even eat it. The worst chicken friend rice I have ever had. It was too sticky.\nThe kabobs...same story...one bite and I refused to eat. They were covered with some kind of sweet bbq sauce!\nAnd the Udon noodles, although edible, but nothing to be ordered again.\n\nOn the whole, it was an okay experience for us. If I happen to go here next time, I will stick with the sushi menu.",

I've maybe had three lunches here and two or three dinners, and despite not being wild about cajun inspired cuisine, I find this place to have plenty of inspiration and more than enough technique to crank out a great meal.  The cochon-de-lait i had at lunchtime about a year ago might be the best one I've ever had.  The burger is definitely one of my top five in the city.  Awesome selection of oysters on the half shell and good drinks to boot.  \n\nStill, something is missing from the dinner menu.  It's not the size of the plates it's just that there doesn't seem to be anything that I want to just jump out and order, or anything that I am dying to order every time I go there.  I think if I order oysters then I can order an entree have satisfied taste buds, otherwise I don't think the main courses have enough variety even when they have big flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I think the food and service are outstanding, and I really do like the atmosphere.

We were given the back room to ourselves where she kept the mimosas flowing. Very accommodating to my food and drink allergies as well. For breakfast I ordered an omelette with steak, cheddar and spinach, which came with home fried potatoes. They apparently ran out of tots but I was going for home fries so it didn't bother me. Everything was delicious and portioned huge. I couldn't finish. The Ginful Desire was a pleasantly refreshing cocktail. Raspberries, lime, basil, and ginger beer. Garnished with fresh raspberries and highly pulpy. Since I can't drink beer, the bartender recommended ginger syrup instead. I spent just under $20 on myself which is on my cheap side for brunch. I would love to eat here again thanks to Cadia's outstanding hospitality. Not to mention the women's restroom is an unexpected mermaid themed oasis!",

We got seated quickly BUT this is when it went downhill.\n\nWe seriously sat there for a good 15 mins without anyone coming to us for drink orders nor were we acknowledge.  Luckily for them we had met someone the night before and was treating him out to brunch or we would have gotten up and left.  \n\nI flagged down the person that seated us to let them know we have not been helped and she said that she'll send someone right over.  Someone (who wasn't our waitress) came and gave us some water and said our waitress will be right over.  About 5 mins later someone finally showed up at our table.  SERIOUSLY?  HOW COULD SERVICE BE THIS BAD at such a notable restaurant????? \n\nShe took our drink orders and we did not get them until 10 mins later.  Our waters never got refilled during this time.  We also put in our food orders when she took our drink orders.  \n\nIt took a good 30 or so minutes for our food to come out.  Our waitress never came back to check on us during this time to refill our waters or ask us if we wanted a second round of drinks. \n\nBy the time our food came I was not in the mood to eat anymore.  I ordered the Egg in the jar and was really looking forward to it but in the cranky mood I was in, I barely touched it.  I'm sure it would have tasted better if we hadn't been ignored for so long.  The only thing that kept me happy was the conversation that was being had with the company I was with.\n\nIf Luke were real, I would kick his ass!\n\nUPDATE (5/30/14):  A manager at Luke's reached out to me after this review and apologized for the lack of service and extended an invite back.  I will give Luke's another shot.  Stay tuned for another review....",

It's a pretty modern and happening place, with a cool feel to it.\n\nI really was looking for a good salad, and was pleasantly surprised with my Junk Salad (romaine, salami, shrimp, olives, pepperoncini, hearts of palm, grape tomato, cucumber, blue cheese, champagne dijon vinaigrette).  This was a super tasty salad.\n\nI came back 4 days later and had the burger and sweet potato ships.  Burger was pretty good, and my only complaint was that the chips were a little on the salty side.  Brush some of the salt off and it was good.",

My friend had the lavender hibiscus and all you could taste was lavender! It seriously tasted like you were drinking the liquid version of the flower. Our pastries were divine! I had a peanut butter cookie and she had a strawberry scone. This scone was so good that while we were sitting outside on the picnic table eating them and drinking our tea the wind picked up and she said \"oh my gosh my heart dropped because my scone almost flew away\".

It is located in a not so good area with limited parking currently as the street is closed but there is street parking and a few nearby lots.\n\nWe like coming here as the prices are excellent as well as the quantity along with taste.  They serve noodle soups, stir fried noodles, rice dishes, entrees such as sweet and sour pork, tofu choices and vegetables such as gai lan and snacks such as dumplings or something light.  This place is popular and we always bump into someone we know.\n\nThere are booths and a few tables and you can seat yourself.  There is nothing fancy here, the water comes in plastic cups and you get Chinese tea.  They give you a menu with an order form and pen so you write down your own order.  The waitress will be around to collect your form or you can bring it up to the front.  Considering how busy it usually is, the food comes out fast.  Once you are done, you can ask for the bill or just walk up to the counter to pay like most customers.\n\nThis restaurant also stays open late so if you are looking for a late night snack or dinner, they are there for you.

Coming from Clarksville, my boyfriend and I's thing is to at least once a month go to eat in Nashville to somewhere we've never been before. I was so excited to try this place, but it definitely wasn't worth the hour drive or the money spent on the meal. First off, (the biggest turn off of the night) our server seemed less than thrilled to be there & much more be serving us. Customer service is a huge thing for me and starting off the meal with a bad server kind of sets the mood for the night. The food was OK, not great, but ok. The nachos we ordered as an appetizer were completely cold. The burgers were better & I have to say the burger meal is just the right portion size. It doesn't look like a lot when it comes out, but it is just enough. The both of us got milkshakes, which were more whip cream than anything else and I just can't justify spending $6 on a shake that consisted mostly of whip cream. I also can't justify spending $50 on a meal and dining experience that is mediocre. Maybe we will try it again one day on a week day.",

At J Gilbert's you'll get a nice steak, two sides, an appetizer and dessert for under $100 a couple.  Still not your typical mall restaurant but a nice addition to my steak craving rotation.  I'll definitely be back.\n\nAs the others said, it's a nice little joint.  Not too many tables but we still didn't have a wait at 7pm on a Friday night.  Bonus!  Because the space is on the small side, be prepared for a slightly noisy dinner.  Once the crowds died down it was a lot more comfortable.\n\nHad the Shrimp Durango to start, which had a nice kick to it.  Great with the warm crusty bread served at every table.  We both had the filet combo with a steak (4 or 6 ounces) and a seafood choice.  The lump crab was delicious and the steak was perfectly cooked with a nice smoked flavor.  \n\nApple Croustade with homemade cinnamon ice cream was a great ending to the evening.  \n\nIf you like Manhattans, definitely give this one a shot.. possibly one of the best in St Louis but at $10 a pop, you get what you pay for!",

  "text": "We tried this place after buying a deal through travelzoo.com. My boyfriend lives right around the corner, so we have passed it a million times, but it never caught our attention until we saw the deal online. It included two glasses of wine, a shared appetizer and two entrees. My boyfriend and I decided on the fried calamari because it is one of our favorite things to order out. The calamari came with fried jalapenos mixed in (which were awesome), but it wasn't used as a filler. There was plenty of well seasoned and breaded calamari. A lot of places won't include the tentacles, but Marmont did- they are our favorite and they were very tender!\n\nI follow a paleo diet, so this place ended up being perfect for me (yes the breaded calamari was a bit of a cheat....) I had the porkchop which was topped with sauteed apples, onions and BACON! Yum! The chop was very moist. I was dissapointed with their side options of mashed or baked potatoes. All other sides were an upcharge. I got the roasted brussels sprouts with even more BACON! They were amazing and both portions were so big I was able to have a very satisfying lunch the next day. The bf was craving steak and he got the 14 oz strip which was cooked perfectly. He was extremely satisfied!\n\nThe service was great! The pricing seemed appropriate even without our deal, although I was a little Dissapointed with how much you had to pay to get some green on your plate ( $9 for my side of brussel sprouts!) We would definately eat here again\"",

We saw someone inside, but they refused to even acknowledge us even though he clearly saw us at the door. By this point, it's probably 2:59pm. It's super hot out, and I'm super pregnant, and we're just hanging out on the steps.  A simple 'Just give us another couple of minutes' would have been greatly appreciated, but instead we were just flat-out ignored.  I get it that you don't open until to 3pm, but your website says otherwise. We were not rude customers trying to force our way in early...we were customers who were misinformed by your website.\n\n1 star based solely on their lack of customer service. We left at 3pm and grabbed lunch elsewhere.",

Neither is very expensive and the quality is excellent.  With AJ's, the one thing you can count on is superb customer service.

  "text": "Honestly our experience here was a complete joke.  We came on a Sunday at noon, and without exaggeration were the only party in the entire restaurant.  We actually wondered if they were even open.  This should have been our first red flag, but we were already there and thought we should  give it a shot.  Within a few minutes our waiter took our drink order so we assumed we were on solid ground.  But, everyone knows what happens when you assume.   Bottom line, we never saw anyone after that moment.  We essentially packed up and walked out after about 20 min and headed down the road to another restaurant.  I cant possibly imagine what they were working on for 20 minutes since we were the only customers,  there were no other tables!!  Were we on Candid Camera?  Who knows, but what I do know is we most likely won't be back.",

  "text": "We've been wanting to try Kanella's brunch for about a year now and given that we needed to be in the area, we decided to try it out. We stopped in without reservations around 1pm and when my bf told the server we didn't have a reservation but it was his birthday, they did their best to accommodate us. Luckily, one of the tables didn't show up for their reservation so we got to stay! Our server was AWESOME. So eager to help and make recommendations, and super friendly. We decided on the watercress salad and cuttlefish, both of which were specials. We also got the lamb sausage and duck egg breakfast. The food was good, but we weren't OVERLY impressed by anything. We really enjoyed the lamb sausage dish, but felt that it was a bit small. The salad was good, but nothing special. I felt that the flavor of parsley somewhat overpowered the cuttlefish, but I also don't really like parsley so I may have been particularly sensitive. Given the incredible reviews, I'm wondering if we just didn't order all that well, especially because we LOVE Meditarranean food. The service was excellent...the server put a candle in our order of baklava without our even asking. I would definitely go back and try it again.",

The second time I brought two guests. We had  an undercooked brownie, hot chocolate that was average and a cherry pie(cold and the crust was so tough you had to use a knife to cut it) and a French Chocolate silk pie which was delicious.  I love the thematic elements, pink uniforms, fancy tableware, high quality condiments and ingredients.

I tried to go on Monday and couldn't find a spot, so I left (there is also no room to turn around now if you go down one of the aisles and there is not spot.  You have to back out of a tight spot).  They lost one of the best competitive advantages they had compared to other bars which was good parking.\n\nThis is something that just happened in last couple weeks.  Parking in this entire city is an issue in several areas and ML Rose can be added to the list.  Probably not even worth trying to go there on a Thurs-Sat night now if you don't get there early.",

  "text": "JACKPOT!\n\n777! 777! 777! Yelp Review 777 for me! Everyone playing the slots would love to see Lucky 7-7-7 for BIG MONEY!\n\nWhile I was in Tampa, I decided to check out the Seminole Hard Rock Casino. The new South Parking Garage had just opened when I was here. I didn't stay at the Hotel, so this review is based on the Casino.\n\nOh man! The floor was very busy and MOBBED with a sea of old folks, with most slot machines in this big casino being played. I felt very young, like I was walking through a huge and glitzy senior citizen recreation center. I think to myself: As a current working class taxpayer, I really hope those folks are financially stable and not gambling away their Social Security and Medicare checks. (sigh)\n\nThe Casino also has poker tables, Texas Hold Em tournaments, bars, nightclub, restaurants, food court, and the Hard Rock Retail Store. I saw the food here was on the pricey side and it's good that I ate lunch before stopping here. I did some shopping at the Retail Store and picked up some cool Hard Rock pins and t-shirts. This store does not accept the Hard Rock Cafe All Access Card (points program), but they gave me a 10 percent discount for showing the card. \n\nOverall, it's not Vegas, but it's a decent place to play the slots in the Tampa Bay area with very easy highway access to/from I-4.",

  "text": "Sorry to do a 2 star review here as this was one of my favorite places years ago. I have been a couple of times in the last few months and its just not the way it used to be. \nWe were there for dinner a week ago, 5 of us, we got seated pretty quickly then we were just sat and waited. The server was really busy, I'm assuming they were understaffed that night. She was friendly when she got to us but honestly it was a little annoying as we were hungry and didn't want to be there too late.\n \nIt was a pretty good wait  to get our food, my sons plate came out even a few minutes after the rest of us had ours. We could have still been been fine here as we were not looking for things to pick on, hey i know we don't live in a perfect world but  once we started eating nobody's food was hot. I'm pretty sure it had been sitting for a while waiting for the server to grab it.\n\nBtw, the Mariachis were pretty good at first. The music was not overbearing, they were not too close and they did sound good! The girl with the fiddle was a real treat!\nThen they got closer and louder and you know the deal, no more talking as you cant hear unless you shout, oh well.\n\nSorry i forgot to specify this, it was the Oracle rd. location.\n\nUpdate: I was back in this location a few months ago as it is convenient for me and as I mentioned in my previous review the La Parilla locations were always at the top of my list for a tasty dinner . The staff was friendly, we got seated and waited on quickly, the food however was disappointing. I really hate to slam the place again but I really think the owners should spend time trying to figure out whats going on here. There is fantastic Mexican food in Tucson as we all know and these guys should be as good as anyone else, especially given the amount of years they have been around.",

  "text": "A few years back Das Racist, a hip hop band, crafted a track about the beauty of being lost in a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. I've often pondered what Das Racist would've come up with had they called the bay area their hometown. I have no doubt that if they were tracking tunes in this area during the present tense, the song would incorporate the Blind Tiger Cafe and their combination coffee shop and clothing store. I'm not sure there is a better spot in town to get lost and spend a few minutes (hours) enjoying what's around you. The Blind Tiger Cafe is the first coffee shop in the bay area that I\"m completely enamored with. I love the product, the design of the space and the education opportunities the cafe offers.\n\nProduct wise, The Blind Tiger Cafe offers coffee, tea, baked goods, locally brewed kombucha, a Cafe Hey style oatmeal bar and locally made apparel. I've yet to purchase anything from the apparel side, although I see a t-shirt or two in my future. For now, I've spent my cash/bitcoin/credit card on the coffee and baked goods side of the store. My drink of choice has been, to date, the Cafe Mocha with almond milk. This drink blends just the right amount of almond milk and coffee. The coffee taste, which is normally a no no in my book, is one that I've actually come to desire. That's because The Blind Tiger Cafe uses really good coffee. A cup of coffee at The Blind Tiger Cafe is by no means cheap. Adding in almond milk and a tip brings the drink to six dollars or so. But, the drink is vegan and I enjoy the flavor, so I'm ok with treating myself every so often. On one of my visits I purchased my daughter a plain bagel which came toasted. It was served alongside grape jelly. The bagel was pretty big but other than that there wasn't anything that really stood out about it. I guess that's to be expected because people don't visit coffee shops for the bagels.  \n\nThe design of the Blind Tiger Cafe fits right in with the rest of Ybor. It has an industrial look, with its exposed pipes and brick walls. Speaking of the walls, they are covered with graffiti style decorations. One large mural shows the process that coffee goes through before it gets into your cup. It fits with some of the other murals that are featured on the walls around Ybor. \n\nOne of the unique things that The Blind Tiger Cafe offers is an educational opportunity in the form of a coffee class. This class shares some of the different types of brewing processes that the cafe uses and how those brews contribute to the taste of the coffee. I had a chance to participate in the class through a Yelp event and it was a completely fascinating class whether you were a coffee enthusiast (like some of the other Yelpers) or you just enjoy learning new things (that would be me). A Yelp check in to The Blind Tiger Cafe brings with it a coupon for money off of the class. Totally worth it if you have the time and money.",

  "text": "If you're desperate for sushi, this place is merely okay.  Nothing special.  A real hit and miss.  We were somewhat regulars only because we typically love sushi and there aren't many options in Santa Barbara.  But this place was starting to get old fast.  Each time we order, we never know if it's going to be just ok or gross altogether.  The service make it ok to try yet again if you're really graving for Japanese food.  One day, I wanted ramen and thought I'll just order a simple one.  Soba noodle with tempura, and boy, was this a total flop!  The broth tasted like chicken fat and nothing else.  No seasoning, just piping hot chicken fat broth.  You could even see the raw fat floating at the top of it.   After a couple of sips, I immediately wanted to throw up.  The yellow tail sushi we ordered was old and smelled fishy.  Fresh fish never smells fishy.  This sealed our decision to never go back again.  Then we discovered Yume Sushi.  Thank goodness for Yume Sushi.",

The staff was beyond amazing with educating my group on the ins & outs of making perfect pizza dough, along tutoring us on the science of toppings and pairing our entire experience with wonderful flights of wine (almost bottomless glasses!), it impressed everyone that attended.  I can't wait to come back and have the pizza again, it was amazing.  Every side dish and appetizer we were served was better than the last.  The employees took pictures of our party while we were crafting our masterpieces and I got to spend more time with my clients.  Overall, A+++ evening.  Can't wait to come in the spring/summer and sit on the back patio.  Bonus?  They have a side patio for our four legged friends!",

I wasn't expecting much from the buffet but at least expected the place to be clean.  The entire buffet area was filthy!  Food all over the floors including the dining rooms.  We stuck to the floor as we walked around.  Of all the bathroom stalls, only 1 had toilet paper.  The area by the frozen ice cream had standing water on the floor.  It took several attempts to find clean plates.  I could go on and on.  This place has so much potential.  The Decor is super cute.  The game room was really fun.  We loved the go-carts and mini bowling.  My nephew wants to go back but it would take some changes for me to go back.  Perhaps we went on a bad day?  I can handle so so food  but not uncleanliness.  I hope management will read this review.",

  "text": "Dined here during Restaurant Week last night and it was exactly as I expected. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation at 9:30. The hostess directed us to the bar while our table was being set-up. We all ordered drinks and then headed to the table. Not a bad wait, but a little longer than I thought it would be for such a late reservation. Our table was in a second dining room in the back, still lined with windows thankfully. We were fortunate enough to have a table with a view, which I highly recommend requesting. Our waiter was very nice and suggested we start with the Mac and cheese.... He knew me to well. But we declined, since we were ordering 3 courses already as it was. The waiter brought us some bread to start, which oddly enough tasted like an everything bagel. For appetizer I went with the seared tuna, which was perfectly cooked and tasty, but very small. Another friend enjoyed her winter squash soup, vegetarian. For entree, the majority of the table ordered the filet and short-ribs. Again, it was another small portion and nothing exciting. One dish was actually missing short-ribs, but the waiter did apologize and brought them out on a separate dish. Our vegetarian friend ordered the leak risotto, which I tasted and liked more than the beef. During our dinner we requested more bread, but it was never delivered. For dessert I had to go with the banana dish, my favorite fruit. It was alright, again, nothing special. This place is definitely better for just fancy cocktails and a great view, if you're willing to shell out some cash. I would probably only come back if I could make it for SIPS.",

  "text": "I've been meaning to try this place forever, and I'm glad I finally did.  One of the Owners, Elke, assisted me, and could not have been more friendly and approachable.  I decided on the cold chicken caprese sandwich, lentil soup, and carrot cake to-go.  The order was ready very quickly, and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I opened the sandwich at home, intending to have \"just a bite\" then save the rest for dinner.   FAIL.  It was so flippin' good - fresh mozzarella, crisp greens & basil, toasted bread, thin sliced chicken, light drizzle of balsamic & olive oil - I ate half the sandwich right then.  Standing at the counter in my kitchen.  Hey - I'm sure some people some where eat dinner at 5:15 p.m., right?  The soup was good, and the carrot cake was outstanding.  Elke told me it had won some local awards, and I can definitely see why.  Sandwich gets an A+, so I can't wait to explore one of their dinners to-go next.  They also just started serving a Saturday night dinner inside the small restaurant part (6 or so tables), so that will be worth a try as well.",

The lunch special is only $11 after tax and it's super reasonable (I usually split the meal with someone). The chicken katsu and the gyoza are my usually choices for the rice-meat bowl that they serve with the lunch special.\n\nQuality here wavers, some days its better than others and I wish I could rate Sushiya 3.5 overall.

Nothing real special to brag about. On the last visit, we ordered a Greek salad and two bowls of chili.\nThe bar tender is a great lady to work with and pleasant.  every time we call in an order, we are told the estimated time it will take to be ready.  Usually 10-minutes.  Every time we arrive, generally between 10-15 minutes, we have to wait an additional 5-+ minutes.  This last visit was no different.  Paid the bill, about $15.00 and went back to the office to eat.  Very disappointed in the $5.95 salad as there was virtually no lettuce and only a 1/8 wedge of tomato.  The chili was served in 20-ounce styrofoam go-cups.  The chili was Luke-warm at best.  By the way, the drive takes 4-minutes to get to my office from the retaraunt.  I have found the place an OK place as a restaurant but certainly appears to be nothing special.",

Here's the kicker, they charge $1.50 for fried onions! Are you friggin' kidding me? We also added green peppers and mushrooms to ours for another $6.00....wow. So, now the 12\" cheese steak goes from $10.99 to $15.45. That is rediculous. Like I said, my husband ran out to grab dinner, if I was there, I would have walked out. I understand an additional charge for mushrooms, even peppers...but fried onions? And at $1.50 per add on, the sandwich should have been loaded...but I had to search for the onions and peppers...I did spot the mushrooms...but I would no way say it justified an additional $4.50 on a 12\" cheese steak. In all fairness, the cheese steak was good, but if I'm paying $4.50 to add fried onions, peppers and mushrooms, I shouldn't have to search through the sandwich for them. I'd say the peppers and onions were between diced and minced in size. Will definitely NOT be ordering here again. Just a heads up too, although the fries at $3.99 didn't seem a bad deal...they sealed them in a round foil pan with a lid..so they were  damp with no crunch at all.",

What's not to like?!  This is NOT your mom's diner or breakfast or brunch!  Their bacon with sorghum glaze is wonderful!  The drip coffee is bottomless and beans come from local Bee Roasters.  Located in a former garage, this innovative new Indy dining spot will definitely fix whatever ails ya!  Only 58 seats inside so come early or settle back with a warm, aromatic coffee and people and food watch!",

  "text": "This was our first time here.  We were given a very generous gift card and decided to try Fleming's tonight.\n\nMaybe I'm bitchy, but what is with places in strip malls having valet service?  I get that it's complimentary, but it is so stupid.  There's a fucking Kohl's and a restaurant with valet.  The only thing more ignorant than the strip mall valet are the douche-bags that use it.\n\nOur server, Quinn, was WONDERFUL.  In the event I'm ever back here, I will request him.  In fact, I'll DEMAND him!  You should, too.\n\nWe started with the calamari, which was really good. The pickled peppers were a nice sweet and tart touch.  The calamari was very tender.  4 star dish, without a doubt.\n\nWe then had salads, Mr. Jen F had the Fleming's salad and said it was fresh and tasted nice.  I had the wedge, which was very good with a nice slice of bleu cheese and crisp bacon. \n\nWe each had the filet.  I made mine Oscar style and Philip added the barbecue shrimp.  Steaks were great, flavorful, tender and cooked perfectly.  5 stars on the quality of meat and preparation.  The toppings were probably in the 3 star range.  My Bearnaise was good, but there wasn't very much.  The crab was flaked lump instead of a large, juicy piece.  \n\nThe sides weren't awesome.  We had Fleming's potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and roasted cipollini onions.  We actually had to send the potatoes back as they were completely under cooked.  We NEVER send things back, but the potato was raw and this really turned us off of the dish, so we got fries.  The fries were very good.  The mushrooms and onions weren't great.  Under seasoned and many of the onions had a thick outer skin that would have been better off removed.  \n\nDrinks were kept full.  We were very well cared for.  \n\nDessert and coffee were pretty good.  Carrot cake was outstanding and the cheesecake was only okay.  \n\nWith generous tip to the delightful Quinn, we came to about $250 and that is too much for this place.\n\nP.S. The tablets with the wine list and dessert menu are obnoxious.  Are you a traditional style chophouse as your menu suggests or are you a nouveau bistro?",

I pass Roberts everyday on the way home from work and have to fight the urge to stop in for beef jerky. Not only is their beef jerky to-die-for, their sandwiches are great. My mouth waters just thinking about their filet mignon sandwich, loaded with cheese and onions on a soft roll topped with mayo, lettuce and tomato. This is the kind of sandwich that makes your eyes close, as you bight slowly into a little piece of heaven. I've also had the pork tenderloin that is not only huge, but great and the burgers which are made out of filet, yum.\n\nAnother favorite of mine is going to the \"butcher\" side of Roberts (door on the left) and getting fresh steaks to grill. They will season your filets up right there so they are ready to be thrown on the grill when you get home.\n\nI just saw that Roberts is on Uber eats now and I am so excited to be able to get Roberts delivered right to my door!",

  "text": "Checked this place out based on Yelp reviews. The location is strange. It is hidden in the back of a plaza behind the UPS store and across from Walgreens. The decor inside is very nice. Beautiful decorations and a dope upscale vibe. There is several TVs which had sports on. I dig it. The food selections are great. The food is tasty. There was a few things that could have been better. I started with a beef patty. I was very disappointed in it. It is not homemade. It's the frozen patties sold at the grocery store. The curry chicken was runny. I prefer the curry to be thicker like the Ox Tail sauce was. The skin on my jerk chicken was soggy instead of crispy how it should be. Overall I was happy with the flavors though as everything was seasoned properly. I do feel that more heat could have been used, but I imagine they toned down the heat based on location and the majority of the customers probably not being used to the spiciness of island food. I had the sampler with curry chicken, ox tail, & jerk chicken. The rice & peas is ok. The mac & cheese was delicious but at $6 was overpriced. The highlight was definitely the Ox tail. It was perfectly seasoned and melt in your mouth tender. The main complaint I have with this place is the pricing is much higher than any Jamaican spot I have been. Ever. Typically stewed chicken, jerk chicken, & curry chicken are in the $7-8 range. Here they are $14+. Maybe they are taxing based on the location being in South Tampa, but I don't think this food should cost so much. $3 for a Caprisun. Desserts are $8+. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming. I just feel like there is better options for this food at a much better price point.",

This is one of the best ramen places in town. I only give it a four star because my family makes ramen and I'm biased with how ramen should taste. However, ramen at Ichicoro is a must-have. It's full flavor and the broth is well-prepared. I only wish that it could be a little less salty, then again my taste buds are hard-wired differently. Overall, I recommend this place if you want to have a unique-tasting experience in a hip place downtown.",

  "text": "When I hear the name \"Wang Gang\" asian cuisine doesn't come to mind.  After dining there, it never will.  \n\nWang Gang's identity is convoluted.  It is trying to be some upscale \"asian cuisine\" type restaurant, but the actual name is \"wang gang\".  For those who don't have an imagination at all: penis, wang stands for penis.  The sizes used to be \"big wang\" and \"little wang\".  Lovely.   I remember almost laughing out loud when I walked in the new location and the lights were dimmed.  I should of asked the greeter, \"is this the same place where I can order the size of my food by big or little wang\"?\n\nThe actual restaurant atmosphere is like being in a cafeteria with nice decorations.  We literally could not hear the waitress.   Perhaps because the waitress treated us as if this were her last day on the job.   She rushed everything, and brought us the check while we were half way into the meal. \n\nThe only small positive is that the food was not bad.  However, the temperature was lukewarm at best.  Moreover, for what you are paying, you are better off walking into the door next door at Shangri-la.  If you really want \"asian cuisine\" go to Oriental Spoon in Edwardsville.  That is an actual quality restaurant in every regard: food, service, atmosphere and normal business name.",

  "text": "Ok. I hate this. I went here because we were able to get out of the rain here and get seats at a counter without reservations (a couple of other places were full, or reservation only) on New Year's Eve. It's loud, had college football on the TV'S and cheering patrons. I know, it's New Year's Eve....expect loud, obnoxious people. \nThat being said, our server, Tootie, was a sweet, polite professional. Obviously used to dealing with this type of environment.  \nI didn't expect much in the taste department, but I was TOTALLY wrong! \nTHE FOOD:\nWe started with an appetizer of Gator Traps. \nPanko-breaded alligator and jalapeno cheese stuffing, deep fried with sweet corn rounds. Came with 2 sauces.  The gator traps had great bite and flavor, and both sauces were above average. \nFor my entree, I got The Debris..Two burger patties smothered with roast beef debris, pepper jack cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms on a brioche bun. Tater tots on the side. The Tater tots were fantastic,  but hey, deep fried potatoes in any form are fantastic! The Debris was a taste surprise to me. I took the top of the bun off so I didn't fill up on carbs so early in the evening (7 pm). The bottom of the bun was too soggy to pick up any way. I cut it up and ate it with a fork and knife. The roast beef debris was peppery and plentiful and tasty. The burgers were great, too. Apps and entree I give 5 stars for taste. \nThe girl who would be my girlfriend had the Buffalo Shrimp Salad. They were ok with a substitute buffalo chicken with the shrimp, and the girl loved it. She was really satisfied with it. \nOverall, food fantastic. \nThere was a glitch when a patron was throwing his arms around behind us and knocked a server carrying drinks into the girl who would be my girlfriend and got her a little wet. Not the servers fault. \nI'm going to give 4 stars overall.\nThe bill was kind of high for 2 cans of Miller Lite, 2 Chardonnay's, 2 entrees and an app ($75. Plus tip)\nThe men's room has 1 stall, and was only kinda clean.",

The mimosa menu alone makes this worth a visit. Second, the food is excellent. My husband loves the Return of the Mac. I prefer the French toast- any of their versions is excellent.  I also love the house made yogurt and granola.\n\nDon't forget to look at the pastry selection!",

When we first showed up I instantly thought there was no way we were going to get seated right away and would have at least a hour wait because the parking lot was packed.  \n\nThis place isn't cheap so if you are trying to go out for a quick bite to eat with the family this is not your place.  If you are going out for a special day with your family this is a great place to go.  They have a decent sized kids menu and the kids food is great.  We went for a later dinner and I think the waitress could tell our kids were ready for their food.  As a result of that the kids food came out in less that 10 minutes and was delicious.  \n\nTo top it all off this place has the best military discount I have ever seen.

  "text": "Bhature. It's bread that they fry. Fried bread. FRIED BREAD. It happens to be absolutely delicious, too. Their other breads [naan, kulcha, etc] were good and to standards you'd expect from a good Indian restaurant. But that goddamn Bhature, I'll have that all day.\n\nLet me first say that it's very nice inside, feels upscale and is definitely a nice place to take someone out on a date. They even play Bollywood flicks on the TV there, great distraction if the date starts talking about the Kardashians or her ex, so just lose yourself in the food and 100 people dancing on the screen.\n\nOpened up with the Pakoda, and having been craving it since I last been to Zaika, it hit the spot. A plate of it is perfect for four, a bit overwhelming for two. Since I'm an eternal fatass, I polished it off, but it didn't leave much room for the dinner...\n\nWHICH WAS INCREDIBLE. It was the Paneer Bhurji, and it will go down as one of the most tasty items I've ever had at any Indian joint. The waitress asked what level of hot I wanted it at, and I foolishly said 10 at first, but quickly revised it to a 7 when I saw her next. The lady friend insisted a 5 was intolerable last time she ate here, so I moved the heat index accordingly from my understanding of her tolerance.\n\nGood move, the curry made me sweat, but didn't break me. BEAST MODE MOTHERFUCKERS. The great thing about food from this region is how exotic it is in comparison to the foods we eat here everyday, so it's a real treat when they take so much care in its preparation and the outcome is as bangin' as my dinner was.\n\nThe place is entirely vegetarian, so the dish consisted of grated cheese, onions, and bell pepper with their special dash of spices in a curry. Wholly unexpected was the awesome dish placed in front of me, and staring down a dish of rice [it's included] and a whole basket of nom-tastic Indian breads. Having stuffed myself on the Pakoda, I had to force myself to eat the spicy dish until my stomach called it quits. Not sure if it was from the peppery goodness or just telling me that one man should not consume more than a couple pounds of food in a single sitting.\n\nLong and wordy, but you honestly just look at that star rating, and for there not being a lick of meat in the building, this place was unbelievably good.",

My favorite thing is the Penne Pasta with Eggplant on top. his is not a menu item, but something they are willing to do, and it's delicious and a HUGE portion!

We ordered the fish tacos and shrimp fajitas. The tacos were okay, but the fish was a little soggy and not hot. The fajitas tasted okay, but nothing like we remembered. The jumbo shrimp (6) really didn't fill any one up. Crossing this place off our list.",

The dining room had 10 tables available, only 2 of which were clean. The manager snapped at an employee in front of all of us. Just disrespectful and dirty.

It was apparent that they had just been made and the chickpea flour covering was a tasty combination of crunch and chewiness.  With our guests they were gone in a heartbeat.

Great setup in this restaurant, I had a chance to eat in the back room where I could see throw a glass preparing the food, which I extremely enjoyed and made me want to be a chef for a moment at least. \n\nThen the food came out, mmmm. I went for lunch and I had a Pressed Sandwich of Whole Roast \"cochon de lait\". This is probably the best cochon de lait I ever had! It came with house-made fries, which I couldn't stop eating. They were addictive! Thankfully they weren't unlimited because I probably would have turned into a fries.\n\nI treated myself to a cocktail, The St.Charles Streetcar. It was St Germaine, Pear Vodka and Champagne. First off, no drink could go wrong with St. Germaine, but add in pear vodka and you have one of those situations that make you want to start singing Janet Jackson... or maybe that part is just me.\n\nTruly enjoyed myself here!

The food here is unbelievable amazing and the biscuits and gravy for breakfast are great unless you would like your eggs scrambled!!!!!!! I was told by the guy making my coffee that it wouldn't be as pretty of a dish by having them scrambled... I waited for a \"Bazinga\" but the guy was very serious. I spent about ten minutes not try to lose my $&@& and we finally were able to resolve the pretty-ness of my breakfast and I got scrambled. The food arrives and I am blown away by how good it tastes (even though my eggs were scrambled!) \n\nDay 2: I walk down stairs ready for breakfast and I opt for the hash of the day, of course it has egg in the description and sure enough... \"It ONLY comes fried or over easy\" said the other guy making my coffee. Once again I try not to lose my $&@& but this guy just wouldn't give up. I was able to connivence him to go back to the 'line cooks' and beg them to please find a soft spot in there heart to make my eggs scrambled... They were able to and I will forever be in their gratitude because this is the best. hash. ever. \n\nMy two cents... If the customer asks for a variation of a freaking egg... Don't tell the person paying your bills that you, \"don't like\" to do it that way! It's an egg!!!!",

I had a salad - the poached shrimp on baby lettuce and it was also good, perhaps a bit sparse but fine.  We shared a pear tart that was a tiny bit dry but had a yummy vanilla sauce served with it.  \n\nMaybe dinner is a different story but this seems like a great place for \"ladies who lunch\".

The staff was a little disconnected and didn't seem interested in helping us. The only drinks she offered me were in a case with water, naked juice and Gatorade. Not much of a selection. Our food was pretty good but the service and dynamic of the people working there was weird and unwelcoming. The food was good enough but I felt uncomfortable being there.",

The lines are always insane.\n\nThey have live bands on some of the nights- again, sometimes hard to get a seat, but if you do- that's always a plus. There is a cover charge for some of the shows.\n\nBrunch is always pretty good- they have a buffet-style eat all you want thing they do on  Sat/Sun mornings. Buffets usually weird me out, but they do offer a regular brunch menu. Food is great- they have a wide selection of food. My go-to is the Country Grilled platter.\n\nIt's a good sign that it's busy- usually on the weekdays it's not quite so packed.",

The place doesn't look like much but the service and food will definitely make up for the small restaurant. Also conveniently located.",

The food is full of flavor and the spice is amazing. I love that they ask your spice preference. Gobi manchurian and samosas are delicious. I've had several of the lamb dishes and they were all phenomenal, my favorite being the lamb roganjosh. Chicken Tikka masala was great; the reviewer who commented it had weird veggies in it must have gotten the wrong dish because I've had it several times here and have no clue what she's talking about. Service is awesome; they started recognizing us after our third visit. The servers are great at helping you navigate the menu and picking out the dishes they find to be most flavorful.

  "text": "Breakfast visit and wish I could report back EPIC stuff but alas I cannot. Makes me sad sharing that a $30+ breakfast just didn't hit the spot for TWO people. What the heck!?\n\nFirst, the artichoke and ham omelet for nearly $11 is a massive disappointment. Not much of an omelette and was served with 2 sourdough toasts that quite frankly tasted a little (just a little) better than the omelette. The cheese was partially melted in the omelette...seriously, that's a big no no. The artichoke was alright and the ham wasn't great... \n\nThe granola pancakes were tasty but not fluffy and LOTS of air holes. You get 4 thin ones for roughly $11.\n\nWe were asked if \"bottomless coffee\" was what we wanted and of course that sounds awesome, right? Well...skip it. Cause for nearly $3.50+ you're just paying for unlimited refills which doesn't make much sense considering EVERYWHERE ELSE let's you get bottomless coffee for under $2.50 or thereabouts. We had to ask for milk since they don't keep that at the coffee bar.\n\nService is meh...they are somewhat friendly at the bar but there's no table service and it feels awkward if they clean the table or if you're supposed to do it...however they don't mind asking for a tip when you pay for your order. Also? They give you a NUMBER. It's a stand that has a number and you take it to your table. They should try to adopt what Chick-fil-a has and go with colors or what Mud House does with animal faces. I don't know, something better than a NUMBER. \n\nWill I be back? Probably...but when there's other choices nearby...you know.",

  "text": "We went to the District on New Years Eve. We made sure to call ahead and booked it over there on the bus just in time to try their food that was recommended by a friend. It did not disappoint. Their location reminded us of Portland, OR. I had the chicken slider -- it was okay, not out of this world. But, what is out-of-this-world are their donuts! We bought 3 to have champagne and donuts to ring in the new year and they were amazing. As we were walking out of the restaurant we were talking to the manager and he gave us 4 more for free (they had already closed)! \n\nOn NYE, we were able to cut the donuts into 6 slices (yes, they're THAT big), so everyone could try some of each. By far, the egg nog was our favorite... then the Chunky Monkey. The one's with no filling or icing were a little dryer, but still quite good. These aren't you're typical greasy donuts, they're fluffy and yummy.\n\nMy partner and his mom really loved their sliders (see photos) and we all LOVED their salad! I would go back to just have their salad and donuts. \n\nWe would recommend this place to anyone coming into town. It is a little pricey, but the food and how they work with charities is amazing. So, eat local!",

  "text": "This is an older hotel that needs updating badly.  We stayed for 4 nights in a non-smoking room on the first floor facing the marina.  The other rooms around us were obviously smoking rooms as each time we left the room we were overwhelmed with smoke.  The beds were the best part as they were wonderful.  The TV was small and the cable kept fading in and out of service.  The small refrigerator was a nice addition and a microwave would have been nice.  The coffee maker would only make 1 cup at a time and they were very small cups of weak coffee.  There is not any counter space in the bathroom to set things on.  When taking a shower, the water would be perfect and then would turn really hot and then go cold like someone flushed a toilet.  There is not a pool here.  The best time to go to the casino is in the morning as it becomes very smoky from cigarettes later in the afternoon and the ventilation is poor.  I had great service at the registration desk and all the employees were very nice. This hotel is very dog friendly and has an area outside the hotel designated for pets with poop bags.  (first time I have seen this at any hotel.) The hotel room maintenance team did a great job.  The Marina is really nice and a great place to walk or jog. It is very dog friendly with a fairly large secure dog park where they can run free and get some exercise.  I think I would probably choose a different hotel next time.",

  "text": "I have been somewhat of a regular at Sushi Haru for the past year. Well, tonight they lost my business forever. I ordered the tempura japenese bagel, which I always ordered. I also ordered a Mexican roll and a gator roll. The tempura roll tasted bad,  as if the oil it had been cooked in was old. I had 1 piece  and didn't eat anymore if it. The waitress/owner never came back to the table after the food was served. She didn't even refill my water glass, which sucked because that was all I was drinking. Once my friend and I had finished eating she came over to take our plates which still had a few pieces of the other rolls on them. I told her to please don't get mad, but the tempura roll tasted bad. At that point she became hostile towards us. She said it was popular and I agreed but that tonight it did not taste good. I said I'd like a box for the few other pieces and if we could get our check.  she said she would not give us a box because it was happy hour. Then she said if she was going to give me a box then she was going to go ahead and charge me for the uneaten  sushi roll that I told her did not taste good. I wasn't planning on taking it anyway.  I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant that I frequent often by someone who is the owner. She lost a good customer over $3! By the way, the food isn't that good anyway. Was just a convenient spot to get in and out of because they never have any customers.",

You can play games, order drinks, and even order desert through this tool, and of course pay your bill (if using a card). You cannot place your meal order, still need to do that through the server, but it's great when you need another beverage and the server is off helping others.\nI have had the chili mango tilapia the last couple visits and it has been great each time. It has quite a bit of kick to it and I love it. It comes with the cilantro lime rice, but I'm not a fan of that so I usually ask for double veggie instead.\nMy daughter is a fan of the classic rib plate with french fries.\nThe entire family loves the Texas Cheese fries. the fries are topped with cheese,  bacon, green onion and jalepenos. this is my favorite appetizer.\nAs for deserts, the cookie/icecream combo is very tasty. the cheesecake does taste a bit frozen, but it is a good size portion for sharing and the strawberry sauce is very tasty.\nThe service is good each time we visit.",

  "text": "I wanted to like this place a lot, but it just didn't happen this time. I am hoping that I can give them another try, because I am a burger fanatic and would love to enjoy a good non-McDonald's burger every once in a while. I came here around 9:30 PM and ordered a double Trenton burger with ketchup, mayonnaise, pickles, and raw onions, along with fries and an Oreo milkshake. The milkshake was decently good. There were too many fries and they were a tad on the dark side for me. There needs to be a good fry-to-burger ratio, in my opinion, when ordering a burger and fries. What am I gonna do with a whole bunch of fries after I'm done my burger? I wish they'd charge less and give less fries. On to the $9 burger. It was okay but fell short in so many ways, and that's ultimately why this place only gets 3 stars. It seemed to lack seasoning as there was little taste to the burger. The bottom bun had also gotten soggy and flat from the other ingredients and sort of fell apart in my hand as I was grasping the burger. For whatever reason, the pork roll didn't add much to the already unseasoned burger. Would've maybe been better if there were two pork rolls on the double burger, and if the beef patties were seasoned more thoroughly with at least salt and pepper. I could not even taste salt, at all. I wanted to fall in love with the burger so badly, but the lack of flavor each time I took a bite was just so disheartening. I'd like to give this place a try when I'm having another cheat meal in a week or two! I hope my next experience will be better and that this was just a one-off.",

Thank goodness the great food made the semi-treacherous drive worthwhile.\n\nWe started with the Salumi (cannot recall which 3 we selected!) which was pretty tasty, especially the little pickled pearl onions.  We also tried the Pepperonata which was FABULOUS, the Crispy Chicken Wings (I didn't try but my mates said they were good) and the Mommy's Meatballs.  Everyone ordered pizza as the entree.  Two of us had the Polpette Diavolo - Excellent, one had the Pepperoni (again, cannot recall if there was another name to it) - Delicious, and one had the Potato and Gorgonzola.  Oh my goodness.  That could have quite possibly been the best pizza I've ever tasted.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, Art (chef) is a doll and Toni (hostess/manager) could not have been sweeter.  Our server (I think her name is Jenny) was knowledgable, friendly, and attentive without hovering or smothering.\n\nWe are DEFINITELY giving In Riva another visit in the not too distant future.",

  "text": "I want to preface this with the fact that this place is brand new. I think they have a lot of kinks to work out, but there's definite potential, and I'll try them again once they've settled some. \n\nFood: the food was decent. We got snow crab and shrimp, with the Whole She'bang flavor, in XXX spice. I love spicy food, and I'll say their hot definitely had some spice to it. I may get 3 stars next time, instead of 4, just to taste more of the flavor, but the XXX was hot to the point of just heat. The crab was definitely better than the shrimp. The shrimp they use for the headless is a lot smaller than the shrimp for the head on. (Yes, I realize it'll be smaller without the head, but they seem to actually use different shrimp.)  My friend ordered it with heads on. The shrimp seemed a lot fresher, in addition to being larger. I had headless, and some of them were pretty mushy, and generally just not great. My friend ordered a side of Cajun fries, and it was hard to tell there was any \"Cajun\" to it. There were a couple of fries with some seasoning on them, but literally just a few. Friend tried to order beer, but they said they don't have a liquor license. Ok, that's fine. I tried to order soda, they said they didn't have that yet either. So, they're menu is still in work. \n\nService: this is really what knocked the stars down. The hostess and the manager (I think he was the manager?) were really nice. The other folks sometimes seemed bothered to be asked for anything, and seemed pretty overwhelmed. We had to repeat our order 3 times, and we didn't get anything crazy. We watched as they consistently delivered food to the wrong tables. They even took my drink back to refill, and took it to another table and left it there. When I mentioned that, the server said \"oh, I'll just get you another water, it's fine\" missing the point that the cup I had been drinking out of was given to another customer. I got up and went and got my drink from the other table, but it was weird. \n\nOverall, this place definitely has potential. I've gone to similar style places throughout the country, so I do have somewhat high standards. The Mad Crab was more expensive and the quality wasn't quite what it's been at other places, but I also realize we're in the middle of St Louis, but overall food-wise, I would probably give it a 3-3.5. The service knocked them back, but, I'm sure once they get more established, it'll get better.",

Not so heavy that you are returning to work and wanna pass out. lol. Next time I go, I will get a salad. So many salads were ordered while I was eating and they all looked soooooo delicious!\n\nAnother plus...they take level up. If you don't have level up yet, go there, download the app, and scan the code to get $5 off! :-)",

  "text": "Filipiniana is a middle of the road experience for me. I've been there twice now, and tried the shaved ice dessert (not the giant halo halo), the purple ube cake, and a couple of the drinks. The drinks are pretty average (thai tea and iced coffee), nothing special. The shaved ice was an experience - the first time I had it I had it with the red beans and wasn't crazy about it. The second time I nixed the beans and added some extra fruit. I was hoping for strawberries, but the guy serving me said they needed to be tossed, and I ended up with pineapple pieces. This one was a bit better, but it still isn't my thing. Now, the ube cake is a different story. I poached a couple bites from my friend who ordered it. It wasn't overly sweet, the coconut pieces were great, and overall, I didn't expect it to be the thing I liked the most. This place is at least an hour from me, so I wouldn't drive alllll the way for this cake, but if I was having lunch nearby or had errands in the area, I would totally swing in and order one of the giant pieces. \n\nThe people working here are super friendly, the location is a little hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for, and the inside is very clean with lots of bright color. If the seating was a bit more comfortable I could see this being a fun place to hang out.",

  "text": "I have to begin this review by saying that I have never reviewed a restaurant online before but I felt it my duty to try to save someone else from the same mistake. \n I ordered a steak sandwich with mushrooms, cheese and onion rings. My husband ordered a roast beef plate with mashed potatoes. \n1. my steak sandwich had a small piece of steak(the menu said 6 oz so I understand that). However, the steak had so much grissle(I think that's how you spell it) that I could only actually chew and swallow a few bites. 2. The mushrooms on the sandwich were cold, canned mushrooms. I'm not sure if it's a gourmet rule on cooking but I have never ordered a steak sandwich and the restaurant put canned mushrooms on it.\n3. Because they put canned mushrooms on the sandwich, the piece(sandwich slice size) of cheese didn't melt so envision a grissly(sp) steak sandwich, cold watery canned mushrooms, a hard piece of unmelted cheese and bread that was twice the size of anything contained in it.\n3. My onion rings( that i had to pay $2 extra for) were cold.  \nMy steak sandwich and onion rings came to $10.50.....RIDICULOUS\nMy husband fared slightly better as only his mashed potatoes were cold. His was just a smaller size plate though, no where near worth the price. He paid for it with the fact that he couldn't get them to refill his tea. \nThe total cost for the 1 tea and 2 meals, $26.00. For that amount of money we could have went to several places in the area and got FAR better food. Joey b's, pasta house, affton cafe...just to name a few within a few miles. \nAlso to note that because, even though it was rainy and 48 degrees, they had the door open because \"it was being fixed\". The man who was fixing it was chatting on the phone on the porch the whole time we tried to eat.\nIf the owner reads this, my suggestion to them would be, cut the menu down to a few things and make them quality food.  I suspect the lack of quality is due to trying to have too much variety.  \nSave your money and go to one of the other places around.",

They've done a remarkable job transforming a movie rental store into a classy restaurant.  The exterior is pretty much unchanged from the Movie Gallery though. \n\nTo start, we had the salsa trio, which was good, but I found the salsa to be a bit more runny than I like, and at $8, a bit overpriced. The green salsa was by far our favorite.\n\nFor dinner, I had the tamal corn cakes. The beef on top was delicious, but I felt that the corn cake underneath was too sweet - like a very sweet cornbread, when I was expecting more of a tamale filling.\n\nMy girlfriend had the short ribs, which were good, but not mind-blowing. At $24, it just didn't quite seem to live up to expectations.\n\nWhat keeps me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, is that I just didn't enjoy the food as much as I would've liked. There are a million places around in that price point, so the competition is stiff. I wouldn't mind exploring the menu a bit more though, to see if I discover any favorites, but I could take it or leave it.\n\nI am interested in stopping by in their restaurant which is adjacent, for some less formal fare. \n\nWe went on a Sunday night and it was maybe 20% full, so there were no worries on a wait.",

I had a couple bites of his sandwich and I thought it tasted like something you can get anywhere.  Nothing outstanding.  I was surprised when they informed us that the espresso machine was not working that day, and for such a popular brunch restaurant I think that is a big no-no. \n\nWe had to wait 20 minutes to get the coffee we ordered.  Service was spotty, granted it was brunch time on Sunday.  Certain servers there were not very pleasant.  \n\nNeedless to say, I don't think I will be back.",

My fiancé enjoyed her spicy beef soup, though it isn't very spicy upon service. They give you a container of chili oil for you to inflict your own punishment. They have a pho challenge, which costs $50 and you have to eat 2 pounds of meat and 2 pounds of noodles to be victorious. You don't have to consume al of the broth. According to the official wall of champions, there have been only three successful champions. Maybe you will be next?",

Great beer too -- I've had the Blonde many times I've visited Arizona -- my only (small) gripe is the lack of beer descriptions anywhere (no printed list, and the chalkboard tap list doesn't elaborate). The bar was slammed, and it would've been nice to try something new without having to slow service down for everyone by asking what exactly is a \"NCAAle\" when it could've just been written down somewhere. That said, great place overall, and I'd definitely return.",

  "text": "This was the final meal on our trip.  It was pretty darn good.  A couple of things lacking but overall it was still awesome!  They have a Thursday special which is any large cheesesteak and a milkshake for $10.50.  I got a whiz with and a vanilla shake.\n\nCheesesteak-  They use really good meat here.  Its not all hacked up into pieces yet its not perfectly round slices of steak.  Kind of like a hybrid.  The meat was really good.  They load this thing up with a lot of onions too which I like.  The only thing I would change is the whiz.  It wasn't ooey and gooey...maybe it wasn't melted/heated enough???  Something was a little off with it.  The bread was good but a little too doughy.  Still a really good sandwich though.  If I ever go back, I'm going to order it with American cheese. (I read that American used to be the only way you could get a Chinks steak).\n\nMilkshake-  Delicious!  Plain vanilla.  I believe they use Turkey Hill Ice Cream which is phenomenal.  Some of the best ice cream you can get!  You could taste the vanilla bean and it was blended perfectly so you could suck it through the straw without straining too hard.  A great milkshake!\n\nService-  The service was amazing!  The waitress was super friendly and very \"easy on the eyes\".  She got my buddy drink refills without asking and delivered us more napkins when she saw we had cheese running down our face...very attentive!\n\nOut of 4 cheesesteaks on our trip, this would rank number 2 probably behind Steves Prince of Steaks.  I wouldn't recommend the whiz though.  Go with American and it would probably be a 5 star joint!  Total for 2 steaks, a Coke and a Milkshake was $22 and change.\n\n3 stars for the food and an extra one for the service!",

  "text": "What an awesome experience. We arrived at around 9 on Presidents' Day and were seated in about 10 minutes. As we waited we got the bottomless drip, which was very tasty. They offer honey and other regular mix-ins for  your coffee, but I prefer mine black. We also got a sticky pecan bun. I highly recommend this to anyone. It is so doughy and sweet!!!! \n\nAs we were seated, we were immediately waited to and served water and more coffee. I don't understand the bad reviews for service here. Our service was fantastic and all of the workers were so nice and informative. \n\nThe food: we got the Apple Dutch baby pancake, blue corn grits, sorghum glazed bacon, and carrot cake waffle. All of the food was exceptional. I read the reviews on the grits, and being that I'm not a huge fan of grits, I was skeptical, but man were these grits good! The pancake was delicious also. I loved the crunch given by the celery and crisp apples on top; however, I do wish it was a bit more sweet. The bacon was probably the best part of our meal, besides the sticky bun:). I wasn't a huge fan of the carrot cake waffle, and I would recommend getting something else, as there are much better items on the menu. It wasn't horrible by any means, it just wasn't the best.\n\nI love Milktooth, and I'm now gonna be one of those many people that hype it up. Keep up the good work and creative thinking! I will definitely be back to try that grilled cheese with the egg on top, and I want to see what this barista has really got.",

It tasted watered down and looked like the glass was about 85% water/ice. When I commented on the look and taste, the waitress proceeded to tell me that if it looked watered down, there was probably extra vodka in it, which I couldn't taste because it was \"infused\" which cuts down on the vodka taste. What a load of BS. It was one of the most disappointing bloodies I've had. I should have sent it back, but she was adamant that I was wrong. Lettuce wraps had a nice spicy kick, which I liked, but it failed to redeem the dry, canned-tasting chicken. Very. Under-impressed.",

Okay, it's two words; but come on . . . The fries are awesome. Who doesn't love great fries?!

In fact that's the only thing I didn't love about it - it's a bit cramped and noisy and the tables are sort of crammed together in an effort to squeeze in as many eager diners as possible. I get it, it's the French Quarter and most places are on the small side. But anyway...the food was delicious. About as good a breakfast as you're going to find anywhere.

The donuts were nothing to write home about, didn't taste particularly fresh and there weren't many options to chose from. Most of the ones in the delicious looking yelp pics were not available. I went around 12pm so perhaps coming in the morning you may have a better experience. \n\n The sliders were good, a little pricey at $3.25 a pop when two definitely aren't going to fill you up. The waffle fries themselves were pretty good, stay away from the cheese sauce though. It was waaay too thick and just had an odd consistency overall. It tasted like the time I tried to make homemade nacho cheese sauce at home, it had a roux consistency but for my personal tastes, didn't pair well with the fries or even taste particularly cheesy.\n\nNot worth the price in my opinion but I did enjoy the atmosphere.",

You can add fries for $2 (which I did, and they were okay) but I wish there were other (healthier) options.  Maybe there were but I didn't see them on the menu.\n\nI've also eaten their Beet Salad, which I picked purely because of the ingredients listed on the menu (truffled goat cheese, toasted walnuts, pesto drizzle, and sherry vinaigrette - AMAZING am I right) and didn't fully realize just how many beets were in this darn thing until it showed up.  It was still really good and I gobbled it down, even though I'm not exactly a fan of beets, but they're supposedly wicked healthy for you and eating them drenched in cheese, nuts and pesto is the best it's gonna get!\n\nI have not tried any of their \"famous\" desserts, so reserving the potential fifth star for them.\n\nBottom line: I work nearby so I'll come back for lunch, but I doubt I'd go too far out of my way to come here on a weekend.",

Seriously, better then the Pancake House in McCall. My husband is from Finland where food is very fresh, & pancakes are one of his favorite meals- He even says this is the best pancakes he has had in the states (& we've driven across country multiple times, & I'm originally from New York City which has alot of restaurants). I was reluctant to get the strawberry pancakes since you can get strawberry pancakes anywhere, but jeez these strawberries were the freshest & tastiest I ever had. The pancakes themselves were fresh, & it was the first time I didn't even need syrup on pancakes they were that good! The other food too was fantastic, so double win! My husband got the Homefries, & I got the Biscuits & Gravy. Biscuits & gravy came with alot of gravy, & just bursting with flavor! so yeah, this is our #1 breakfast joint now. The waitress recommends the blueberry pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, coconut pancakes, bacon pancakes, or the cherry crepes. they also said it is usually busy on weekends so be prepared to wait- However, it looks more packed then it really is, so the wait isn't that long anyways.",

It is a very bustling place.\n\nAfter eye-balling the Daily Specials' board, we decided to get the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad. ($11) (see pic)  It came with some of their lemon bread which is similar to a pound cake and a cup of their absolutely awesome Vegetarian Tomato Basil Bisque!  If you ever eat here (and I hope you do) you have to get a cup of this bisque.  \n\nOn our way out, we were looking at their dessert case and were told about the store that the Wildflower Café runs next door to the restaurant.  We scurried next door to find a treasure trove of wonderful cookies, cakes, delicacies and 'grab-n-go' items.  Because we both have a bit of a sweet tooth (or teeth), we got a few of their Giant cookies:  Chocolate Crinkle, Key Lime Coolers and Chocolate Pecan.  OMG!",

  "text": "For a hidden-away, counter-service only, tiny Mediterranean restaurant, this place is TOPS. I visited with my Apollo Beach-based daughter and we had the most-wonderful lunch. We are both vegetarians, and I'm on a diet, but the food is so fresh and healthful I felt great even after stuffing myself.\n\nWe shared an appetizer platter of 2 stuffed grape leaves, 2 falafels, hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Tahini, Taktouka, Tzatziki, and Pita Chips. It was ample for two and every bit was delicious. We had each ordered a falafel pita as well, and wound up bringing them home for dinner. They were very delicious - the bread is absolutely the best I've ever had, and in addition to perfect falafels, the sandwiches were chock-full of lettuce, tomato, sweet red onions, and topped with a lovely yogurt sauce. The French fries were really good, but I wished I'd paid another $1 for tabouli.\n\nI noticed that low carb, whole wheat and GLUTEN FREE pitas are available on request. I can't wait to go back before I head home to Atlanta.",

Blanc & were given one glass of light pink wine (weird tasting) & one glass of SB...we noticed & so did ourv server who, after waiving him back to our table, said he noticed too but \"wasn't gonna say anything\" cuz it came out of the same bottle...weird, anyways- whatevs, he poured us a new one & it was no biggie. \n\nFood was tasty- especially after my French onion soup cooled down; umm the HH frys with wine jam were SUPER tasty- like funnel cake moz sticks dipped in incredible jam. \n\nGreat place!

  "text": "Went to Kings Garden for my birthday dinner, let me say that I don't think I will ever go back there again.  When we first walked in I noticed only one family eating in the restaurant. Anyway we decided to order seafood delight with brown rice, vegetable lo mien and a half peking duck with sticky buns.  First of all seafood delight was served on a sizzling skillet which cooled down quickly. Also, it was served with a small portion of brown rice. Maybe its my fault I should have known it was an individual portion and not served family style.  The lo mien was Ok but again it was a small portion.  All of this would have been OK but the peking duck was the worst. I was really looking forward to the sticky buns and to my surprise when the duck came out it was served with cold flour tortillas! When we finished my Mom was still hungry and wanted to order more food (we are not really big eaters).  One saying grace were the fortune cookies that we enjoyed with our hot tea.  When we left the only people eating in the restaurant was the family that owns the restaurant.  I should have gone with my Mom first instinct to have fish and chips for my birthday dinner at McMenamins.",

Their menu items are what you'd find at PF Changs with prices comparable to Panda Express. You get a fresh, clean taste with fast food prices. The Happy Hour menu is cheap and tastes great while a Lunch menu is also offered daily (Sat and Sun included) whereby customers can choose a variety of entrees with soup or salad, white rice (substitute fried for 95 cents), and an egg roll or three small crab puffs for under $10. I don't know how they offer such an abundance of food that tastes great and remains affordable.\n\nI cannot truly comment on the service since I've only ordered take out. However, the interior seems clean, the staff appears friendly, and my food was always ready on time.",

  "text": "I was in town with friends and we reserved two lanes for our event complete with food. Upon entry, I was impressed by the decor, technology and general ambiance of the bowling alley. Check-in was cumbersome. One of my friends gave our groups name and it appeared as though the associate was unable to immediately locate our reservation. We reserved the lanes months in advance. Within about 10  minutes which felt like forever, we were asked our shoe sizes and escorted to our lanes. The associates place the names of the players on the scorecards for you and I liked the efficiency of placing all rental shoes in a basket and escorting us to our lanes. There are not many lanes available, but maybe they don't need it. it was a Saturday night and the place wasn't packed but then again, it was 7pm and maybe the crowd picks up later. I could definitely see this place being easy to convert to a club scene for the younger people (I'm not that old but I'm flirting with 40). Our section had our food placed in beautiful silver warmers that closed. The offerings were roasted vegetable quesadillas, popcorn shrimp and griddled beef sliders. Presentation gets 5 stars!! The taste was ok.\n\nOur server introduced herself to us and I placed my order for my regular drink of choice - Tito's with a splash of tonic. I received my drink, tasted it and well, the bartender was extremely heavy on the tonic. Not wanting to be a problem, I drank it and upon ordering my 2nd I reiterated to the server that I would like a SPLASH of tonic or if it would be easier to just give me Tito's on the rocks with a side of tonic, like a shot glass full so that I could ensure my drink wasn't tonic heavy. I don't need a double pour, just not a lot of tonic :-) Well, she returned with my second drink and hallelujah!! It was perfect! This of course led to a 3rd drink (don't judge me).\n\nThe food was pretty good but the service regarding the cleanliness of the food area was superb. I swear, the young man made sure that area was spotless and I truly appreciated that. 5 stars on that, he was amazing and committed.\n\nSo why the 2 stars? The technical functions of the lanes. I have never seen pins on strings before. That was new, but that's not why this place is only getting 3 stars. The lane kept malfunctioning. We would bowl and the arm would remove the pins, well, pull them up and then reset the others. Then it would do it again and again. This usually took about 3 minutes which once, you add it up, equates to a significant amount of time lost when you are paying by the hour for 4 people per lane. I informed the associate about the problem and he said he would go in the back to check. I'm not sure if he did or didn't because 15 minutes later, we were still having the same problem. I again went to the associate and he said he would reset it. It seemed to have worked but 5 minutes later, back to the old technical difficulties. By this time, I was over bowling and this entire experience and the failure to resolve the issue. \n\nSo if it had not been for the food set-up and the young man always making sure our food area was impeccable, this place would have received 1 star.",

I shared several intimate lunches over the years at Sunset Grille with native Nashvillian, John Siegenthaler. So the location holds special memories for me. I was apprehensive about visiting the \"super hip\" and \"trendy\" Biscuit Love for fear of having to stand in line with tourists and hipsters with their beards w/ wool skullcaps that have become the rage in determining local restaurants success. I found neither. \n\nThe place was quiet, the staff super friendly and \"loving\". Reasonably priced, for Nashville, the food was awesome. The coffee was intense and I am sure sourced \"locally\". I really enjoyed it. As I sat there thinking about my last lunch with John, I could see that this would have been a place we would have enjoyed together.

We don't usually complain about much, but this date night was a disaster! \nWe came to this restaurant at 6 on a Friday night. \nThere was nobody to greet us, so we sat ourselves. We didn't get any water, or even a hello for at least 15 minutes.\nWe saw a table of 2 and 4 leave because they were waiting so long. We were literally about to leave when we got service.\nWe got our drinks rather fast considering the lack of wait staff.\nI got the pork chop and my wife got the half of a chicken. My pork chop was the size of a filet mignon and had some mashed potatoes on the side with some beets on top. Kind of expensive at $20, but rather good.\nMy wife's chicken came out hot, but she cut into the drumstick and it bled all over her plate. The waiter came back and apologized and took her plate promptly. He brought back another chicken about 10 minutes later and there wasn't as much blood, but it was still rather bloody. \nWe got our check and left.\nAs we were leaving we overheard the waiter telling another party that they're drinks didn't apply to the happy hour because they weren't sitting at the bar. They said they were not told that was the case. He said I asked you if you were here for the happy hour or for dinner.\n\nThis place has serious potential, the food I had was good, unfortunately, this experience ruined it for both of us. The beer is decently priced and there is diverse selection.\n\nIf you happen to go here, do not get the half a chicken!!",

I ordered it med/rare when it came out it was more on the done side almost well done. It was very tough, it was the worst ribeye I've ever had.

They have a really cute patio and the best part, they  have these vents on the ground so when they turn the heaters on, it heats up your feet and legs vs. the heaters that heat up your face (I hate those).  This seriously has to be the most amazing thing ever!  The food was amazing!  We ordered the grilled asparagus for our appetizer and it was phenomenol and they bring out yummy garlic bread.  My sister and I split the calamari steak sandwich and got 2 sides of soup:  the black bean and the chili.  We got fries for our side and they were good as well.  The calamari sandwich was pan fried and on sourdough bread with the fixings on the side, including tarter sauce.  All the food was delicious!!!  I willl definitely go back.  I would give it 5 stars for the food, but the service wasn't 5 stars.  It started out great, but then our server just disappeared.  I had to ask the host to get our  server and she just asked what we needed, I told her refills on our drinks, so she just refilled our drinks herself and we never did see our server.  The food was good enough for me to go back... highly recommend it and sit on the patio if you can!! :)",

When something is improperly cooked, the kitchen's job is to fix it. When I asked for my raw dish to be cooked a bit more, I received it incredibly overcooked. A translucent egg is raw. That is not sunny side up. A cool red center is not medium. That is medium rate. There are so many wonderful choices on Nashville, that kind of kitchen attitude is certainly bad for business.

Also - inside and half of outside is all non-smoking!!  Yay!  Our server was great and very helpful.\n\nFood: \nWe liked the corn nuggets and chilli.  The pulled pork sandwich and collards greens were also very good. Surprisingly the ribs were disappointing. Very rough and dry with not much flavor. We sent them back and were told the kitchen says that is the way they were supposed to be. After speaking to the manager (when he stopped by our table to ask how everything turned out) it seems that is NOT how the ribs are supposed to be and he encouraged us to try them another time...after he has time to speak to the kitchen.\n\nSeems like the management/owners are truly interested in making things right. MY replacement pulled pork sandwich was great!\n\nMusic:\nIf you like country music and dancing, they still have it here.

The food was delicious. We had the crab artichoke dip, mahi mahi tacos, grilled octopus with potatoes, crab Louie salad, and a lobster roll. Dani, our waitress was a doll! She was patient, clear and just lovely. I greatly appreciate her kindness and patience to my older parents. The crab artichoke dish was hot, bubbling and delicious. The seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked. Dani brought a birthday sundae for my parents to enjoy towards the end of the meal. Everyone who worked at Bluewater Grill was exceptionally polite, thoughtful and welcoming. I applaud all the great people working at Bluewater Grill and look forward to coming again!",

I also had no way of knowing what all was on the sandwiches.   Previous reviewers have mentioned that the staff speaks some English, but this was not my experience with the lady who was working when I was there.\n\nThat said, I really liked the pork belly bahn mi.  It's the number 4 on the menu, I believe. I  thought the bread was amazing and the ingredients tasted very fresh.   The strawberry smoothie was good but I was not into the bubbles. No big though, next time I will just order without them.  I saw someone get the avocado smoothie and it looked to die for.  Definitely trying that next time.\n\nI will be back when it's not 100 degrees out to try the pho, and I would like to try the bahn mi no.1 if I can ever find out what the hell is on it. I also have read talk of fresh spring rolls on here but didn't see them on the menu. Do I just have to inquire about them or what? Kinda hard to do with such a language barrier between us.",

I liked that they gave us more than 2 sips of wine in our glass, unlike so many other places in the city. During restaurant week, you get an appetizer, an entree and dessert for $20 at lunchtime. I ordered the vegetable quesadillas.  They were delicious, but rather filling.  I had to take my entree with me to go.  I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich which came with garlic fries. I ate them for lunch today, and they were delicious.  My friend ordered the salmon. I tried a bite and it was very good.  I ordered the apple cobbler for dessert.  It was good, but the apples were undercooked and still hard.  My friend got the chocolate mousse and said it was ok.  All in all, it was a pretty good meal.

  "text": "So, we had two different experiences here based on the servers.  We sat at the bar both times. The first night we had a gal that was fun, easy-going, helpful.  The person I was with got two sliders and she really liked the beef slider.  I got the meat pies, which were just okay...they tasted like they came out of a frozen box, but like a nicer brand, as opposed to... for example, Hot Pockets. Ha! Nothing wonderful, nothing terrible.  The drink that the bartender made was solid though.  \nThe second time we went there was a different bartender.  We were there on work, so we needed to stay within a certain budget with our food.  I ordered a slider (they have them as a single option) and a side of the brussel sprouts.  I specifically had pointed to the single slider on the menu when ordering.  When the food came out, it was the two slider meal option, and when I pointed it out (because of the work budget), it was just really awkward.  The bartender came out with an extra plate and proceeded to clear off the second burger and fries and take them in back... The slider was a better choice than the meat pies.  The brussel sprouts were good, but not great, a little greasy.  The environment is chill, relaxed, easy.  This place is not far from the convention center, so it's an easy walk after a long day there.  Obviously, take advantage of the Yelp free drink, and hope you get the female bartender, she's way more fun.",

  "text": "Went here after seeing a matinee show at the Broadway Theater at Pitman across the street. Upon walking in, we saw just one guy in the kitchen and one waitress, with several tables full of people who had no food yet. We had a bad feeling that this was going to be a longer than desired dining experience and debated leaving. We should have done so.\n\nIt took a while to get drinks, all of which were served in plastic cups. The sangria pitcher arrived, and we had to pour the bottle of wine ourselves - fine, as I assumed there were legal reasons for this. But we got nothing to stir it up with, so the wine just sat there on top. \n\nEventually the waitress came back to get our food order, which took forever to arrive. My chorizo tacos were barely warm. The rice was hot at least? Again, everything was served on paper or plastic. It was sort of like eating at a glorified food truck. The food itself was ok, but generally pretty bland. Chorizo should not be bland, so I am not sure what went wrong there. My husband had a quesadilla, and my friend had mushroom enchiladas. Both said they were average. The rice was really the only thing I can say we enjoyed.\n\nFinally, we go to pay the bill, and only then are we told that the place is basically cash only. This isn't posted anywhere. Not on the door. Not on the menu. Not mentioned by the waitress. She then says she can do a credit card if it's an emergency. Well, in our case we didn't have another choice. So she took our credit card and left the restaurant to go run it at another business or something - I don't know.\n\nConsidering the slow service and luke warm flavorless food...we won't be back.",

Dinner is great, but be aware they only sit you down if you and your party are going to order dinner, and more. You are not allowed to have appetizers. \n\nWe ordered the salmon and the steak, both expensive but worth it. The steak was so juicy and just fell apart, a knife wasn't even needed. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the sauce that it was glazed in was just right. Ordered the lemon cheesecake which is served in such a beautiful way, not your ordinary slice of cheesecake. The drinks are strong and are made with quality. \n\nDress up and treat yourself!",

Walking in, there's a birds eye view of various pastries, goodies and this day... this Saturday... the bloody mary bar!  I settled on the breakfast burrito w/potatoes for my meal and it was soooo good!  There aren't many places who do a good job with their breakfast burritos in terms of flavor, but this place is tops.  I'd have to say, this place will be my go-to spot for a breakfast burrito.  Now, potatoes being my favorite food, I wasn't overly thrilled with them.  They could have used about another 2 minutes in the skillet grill.  My friend and I felt comfortable here and actually spent several hours hanging out and talking.  The servers were friendly and weren't bothered by the amount of time we were there.  Matter of fact, we were there so long that happy hour kicked in and I ended up having 2 glasses of $3 house white wine!   Love it, love it!",

It's a ton of food with a chicken kebab, filet kebab (SO GOOD), and lamb kafta kebab (also very tasty) over rice or potatoes with pita and Greek salad on the side. Their chicken gyro is also amazing. It's a pita that is stuffed with the good stuff to about the size of a large softball and really inexpensive. Their seafood special of the day is always tasty and a great way to stay on the lighter side of the menu. Their dolmades are also killer. \n\nIt's also BYOB although I've never done it.\n\nAll in all, you will most likely leave happy regardless of what you order!",

It's nice, but what a misuse of space overlooking the water.  The patio is a joke, luckily the bar does have a view, still not the best use of window space.\nThe food was OK.  Nothing that I would have to go back to visit.  \nWhat I couldn't understand, is it was FREEZING at the bar, was an overcast day, but no employee cared that the AC was on full blast and as we sat at the bar, three people complained to the female bartender who was a little snobby about the LA bread- great, we're in SB, source local, but she ignored everyone who said it was freezing, so she probably lost at least $60 in tips for 3 couples leaving the bar, on a not busy day.",

  "text": "We ate here on a Friday evening. They were very busy and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes for a table. There is no waiting area inside the restaurant and with the amount of people standing and waiting for a table, we sat in the vestibule. It was very cold outside and with several people coming and going, we kept getting hit with doors and the cold air from outside. When they took us to our table, they were still cleaning it off. The menu itself was ragged and in need of replacement. They had a nice selection of items on the menu. I ordered the house salad with ginger dressing, which arrived very quickly. The ginger dressing seemed to be made in house (not from a bottle) - it was creamy and didn't have a strong ginger or sweet flavor. I did enjoy it and would recommend the house salad. I ordered the sesame chicken and my husband ordered the kung pao chicken. Our food was average. I prefer extra sauce and there was barely enough to cover my chicken. My husband said his dish was not spicy. The portions were a little small - about half of what you get when you order take out. Overall we were not impressed and probably will not return.",

My husband's key lime pie was better, but still disappointing.",

  "text": "Review written by my hubby:\n\nMy wife and I were very disappointed with this place. 2 medium pizzas cost us over $35, which wouldn't have been a complete loss if the pizza was spectacular, which it wasn't. The pizza (which we waited 30 minutes for, though we were the only customers in the place) was thin and limp crusted, with rather sparse and unflavorful toppings. The Greek (Grecian) pizza was particularly \"blah\" tasting, and for some might even be considered disgusting. Very strange. Their somewhat Hawaiian-like pizza was okay, but just not anything special, especially for the money. Eclipse's pizza crust is supposed to be something particularly special, but Black Rock Pizza's is far superior by comparison. After this dining experience, my wife and I wished we had just spent $10 for 2 large 1 topping Little Ceasar's pizzas. It would have been twice as good and filling at a third the price. Don't bother with this place. It is more hype than substance. Not worth it at all.",

Two octopus tentacles cooked to perfection with a neat side salad.\nRabbit leg entree was juicy and fall off the bone.

Solid dish with pita, okra, and etc.\nThe pig cheeks was the best! Amazing moist and flavorful. I could not get enough. You must order this!\nThe food was top notch as were the size of the entrees. The chef actually came out a few times and talked to us which made us feel so welcomed.\nAssorted ice creams...there was a dill sorbet/ice cream and it blew my mind! This is a must try if they have it.\nPistachio creme brulee had great flavor!\nService is great. Food is amazing. Prices are incredible reasonable for the quantity, and most importantly, the quality.

We sat at a pub table back by the coffee bar and they were seriously cranking out some hot drinks and lots of whipped cream.   The biggest question about Cyrano's is \"What the hell is it?\"\n\nWhen you drive by, and even when you walk in, you get the feeling your in a trendy, upscale restaurant.  Then they hand you a menu and on its owne it looks like you might be at a Waffle House or something - very casual looking.  Upon closer inspection, though, there are not a ton of items, but they are definitely way too interesting to be at any kind of chain restaurant.  There is also a pretty extensive menu for coffee drinks and desserts, which we just ignored, and a pretty decent wine list.  The bar looks like a counter, almost as if they are embarrassed to have a full bar.  The ambience, while having an upscale appearance, is still very lively.   We weren't sure if it was the acoustics, or what, but this was a very loud crowd.   For anyone who has been to the Benton Park Cafe, Cryano's is what they are trying to be and doing a much better job of it. \n\nWe had a couple glasses of wine by the glass and spinach-artichoke dip.  All was very good.   We won't hesistate to come back for a date sometime and try the main courses.  If it was more convenient, I have a feeling we might become regulars.  Cool place.

You can add your own ingredients into a wrap or if you're feeling like you'd rather eat with with utensils you can opt for a salad bowl. If it's your first time and you're not sure which ingredients will taste good together, I would recommend the signature items! Even with the signature items you can switch things up with your own preferences. I had the Slammin' Salmon which was filled with tataki salmon, gochujang sauce (a red chili and soybean korean sauce), romaine, cucumber, red cabbage, pickled jicama. This blend of the ingredients made for a delicious sushirito! \n\nThe service was friendly and fast as well! The interior was clean and modern with ample seating. For fast and delicious sushirito, this is a convenient place to grab your food and go. For convenient location, great food, decent prices, and innovative concept I give this location 5 stars.

With that said, pizza lovers will not starve in the Gateway to the West.\n\nDewey's pizza has a thicker crust than the cracker crust St Louis is infamous for. They use mozzarella instead of Provel, too. So already things are looking good here.\n\nThey have a wide range of pizzas - all tasty. Service is fast and takeout is available. You can even get partially baked pizzas which can be super convenient.\n\nTheir crust falls somewhere between STL and NYC - soft but not too soft, with a bit of crunch. Not soggy (I will never understand why New Yorkers think pizza crusts should be soggy). Their crust is pretty good, but it never quite 100% does it for me.\n\nTLDR: solid pizza, good crust, real cheese, lots of choices, vegi friendly.",

What I DO know is that my husband and I were going to try it out for lunch today....we're big fans of Diners Drive-ins and Dives so we thought we'd check it out. As we pull into the parking lot - at 2:30 in the afternoon, mind you - we see two girls (not grown women, girls) standing behind one of their cars out in the open in the main lane of the parking lot just feet from the entrance MAKING OUT. This was far more than minor PDA, it was almost vulgar in a soft-porn type of style. We parked and as we got ready to go in one of the girls was walking in the door. Although I can't be 100% certain, I do assume she works there....she was carrying a server apron and other items in with her. When we tried to call and inform the management, we were lead in a circle of automation that never allowed us to talk to an actual person.

What I don't love is sometimes that means having beers that are really not to my taste, while other times I find gems. I found the bartenders and waitresses, while they know their beers, don't know many other drinks. And have a hard time suggesting something to your specific tastes, if it isn't on special. However the sheer amount of beers and the impressive 24 rotational beers make this a location that I can keep coming back to. Especially with groups of people, the problem with that however is table space, this is a place best shared with large groups and there isn't enough space for everyone, especially with small groups of 2 or 3 taking up full booths or eight person tables. This normally is only a problem on weekends however. My favorite nights to go are Mondays (there is local comedy) and Tuesdays when there aren't as many people but it's still the same great place.\n\nThe food is mediocre, but no one is coming here for the food. I've had a different things each time I've gone (six or seven times) and everything from the appies to the desert has always left me sort of meh and wishing I had just bought another beer instead of buying food.\n\nIt's a great place to go with a big group of friends (as long as you are willing to wait for a table on weekends, or go during the week) and try out new beers or craft beers that you won't find on draft anywhere else in the city.",

If I were to rate on the red curry alone I would give one star, but the establishment was clean, and the staff was attentive. One of my lunch companions really liked his fried rice, and my other friend said his massaman curry was on par with Thai Town, and I am taking their opinions into consideration.  As for now, I am not that impressed. Update coming soon!",

As long as you go in expecting a line, get your name on their waiting list (a hostess will come around to get your name), and maybe 15+ minutes wait depending on how far back in line you are. I would not recommend any groups larger than 4 as seating is very limited. So with that mindset, you're ready for Two Chicks Cafe.\n\nI absolutely LOVE LOVE their bbq shrimp and grits. It's the second best shrimp and grits I've ever had (the best is a restaurant in Louisville). I come to NOLA a lot for work at the Convention Center, and would try to eat here every time I come for a visit. I also really enjoy their Green Blast juice if I can splurge on a drink like that. I've had their buckwheat savory crepe before and it wasn't bad. I've heard from multiple people that their quinoa salad is very good. I think I'll give that a try soon. \n\nI thought this place is very tasty and deserves an updated review.",

In my opinion it is not. \n\nThe exterior of the restaurant looks nice but the inside is pretty basic. The chips and salsa were average. The wait staff were nice enough and somewhat attentive, but slow. \n\nThe main event of course was the food. I was in a rush and ordered a beef  taco and an enchilada (boring I know). Obviously, these are not the most complex dishes to do well. Unfortunately, they were not and fell into the mediocre category. Both tasted like pabulum and frankly it reminded me of Taco Bell.  There was no flavor in either dish. \n\nI was really disappointed, paid and rushed out. Would I go back? No.",

We ordered a second round of drinks, but the waitress completely forgot to enter the order. The waitress was not around to get her attention to remind her. Luckily, a hostess/manager was floating around the restaurant asking how things were and we told her about our missing drinks. She was able to get our drinks quickly; although, since our waitress forgot, we didn't end up getting them unitl after our meal was served. I also noticed that other tables had received bread and butter, which we never got. It also took awhile for our dinner plates to be cleared and for our check to come. Also, there was a very drunk group at the bar, wandering around and bumping into the servers and making loud remarks. I would expect a group like this on Bourbon Street and not at a nicer restaurant, yet nothing was done and they kept on serving them drinks. Overall, the service was slow and not very attentive.\n\nI would dine here again in hopes that the poor service was a fluke. The raw oysters were probably the freshest I had on my visit to NOLA. The Shrimp & Grits dish was good, althougn not as good as Mr. B's.",

I was in the vicinity recently and decided to check Ballyhoo out again. I was really looking forward to the fish tacos that used to be one of my fav menu items in the past.. \n\nFrom reading previous reviews it seems that the management had changed hands, any my beloved fish tacos were a huge disappointment! I order the grilled fish version and although the portion was huge, I rather have quality over quantity. \n\nThe fish was horribly overcooked,and the tacos were dry. They did not serve any type of pico de gallo or salsa with it, nor was there any shredded cheese, a taco staple. Just bunch of lettuce, sparse tomatoes and dry, unseasoned rubbery fish.I asked for some salsa and lime and the server brought back one tiny little plastic cup of pico de gallo, and some dried up limes.. \n\nI like to smother my tacos with salsa. The server was friendly but very good at her disappearing act so unless I got up to find her, that was about all the salsa I was going to get! The tacos were accompanied by black beans and rice which were just dull, no seasoning.\n\nMy friend ordered a salad which looked like nothing special either. \n\nI did enjoy my cosmo martini though so a little buzz was nice to get through the mediocre meal. \n\nI'm rating Ballyhoo two stars because of the martini and because I didn't sample any other menu items and perhaps they do better at wings and burgers. But I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again...",

  "text": "This review is for service only, not the food.  I love Blake's crushed ice...I know that's a strange thing to love, but it's true.  I am even willing to wait in the drive through line for just a soda!  And that's what I did yesterday, but wow, I wish I hadn't.  There was only one car in front of me, so it shouldn't have been that long of a wait.  Wrong!  After placing my order and then finally making it to the window (10 minutes), no one came to the window for another 5, and when they did, they had to ask me what I had ordered again.  When I told them, it took another 5 for them to make the soda and get it for me.  And another 3 to get my change.  Pretty ridiculous wait for a soda.  Get it together Blake's!",

I ordered fish.  My date ordered duck.  The bread pudding was pretty good.  We wanted this to be a more romantic outing but it was extremely noisy that we didn't really talk much.  I'll probably try again at a quieter time maybe during the day or during the week.  I've been twice...both times on weekends.",

Not that a bar is a problem. Just looking for better food with the beer to enhance this place.  Hope they try to step up their game in that area. Kudos to our server Dave.  He was awesome.

  "text": "So I generally am not particularly critical of restaurants but today this place needs to get this review. My husband and I arrived and were placed on the wait list. No big deal. Some nice person gave us a sample of the deep dish pizza and we quickly changed our minds on what we were going to order. The pizza was no better than Pizza Hut. We were seated and ordered the artichoke dip and a flatbread pizza. The artichoke dip came out. Most of the chips were small pieces. Hardly suitable for dipping. The waitress did not bring us flatware or napkins. She seemed to disappear so we had to flag someone down to get those. The flat bread pizza was something kids could make. On grocery store flatbread and pre fab low cost ingredients.  To me the biggest disappointment was the level of food served for the price. Expected higher quality for the price. The appetizer was sub par at 9 bucks with bits of chips and the grocery store flatbread at 15 bucks was unimpressive. Probably won't go back because there are local non-chain restaurants that are far better.",

The food & service was amazing! \nOur waiter kris knew his stuff, he recommended good red wine and good food. we had the crab cake & the salmon with pecan sweet potatoes. This is what I was waiting for when I visited New Orleans, for my mind to go omg that was delicious, my fiancé is a chef and he said that the food was amazing that he would def come back. The dessert was blackberry something Alaska, it was okay. Side note: we saw them pick up a table & they actually change the table cloth instead of just putting new plates and utensils. Great restaurant! We couldn't go upstairs because there was an event but def doing back tomorrow!",

Always amazing food, unique small plates that blow away your tastebuds, rare craft beers, large selection of cheeses, and oh yeah, it's a wine bar!?  I go for the beer though :-)   And I can seriously eat every item on the menu they are all as equally delicious.  \n\nThanks Tria for rocking my world.

We drove around and thought the area was super cute.\n\nThis coffee shop/breakfast place has free WiFi (yay), GOOD strong coffee and some yummy cinnamon rolls. You order at the counter and seat yourself at any open table. \nI got the veggie quiche is comes with fruit and the hubby got a breakfast burrito with chipotle cream cheese. I liked that the quiche wasn't humongous and they had quite a few veggies. The fresh fruit cup was also really good (especially the pineapple). Overall a pretty cute place. Although this place has coffee and serves food they are pretty decent at both but not something unique I would drive all the way to Zionsville for. Its more of a if-i-am-in-the-area-i-will-stop-in kind of a place. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.",

Was told, \"this is your table.\" Stephanie was our \"server\". No smile, no greeting, just a script of you either get juice or coffee with the buffet. Then she told us Plates are at the buffet and left. That was the extent of the service. Food is okay, but nothing special. Luke warm buffet line food. Would not recommend for $30 a person, or for $20 per person.\n\nGo to see the aquarium, which you can do for free. Eat somewhere else.

I made the reservation in October of last year and cancelled in November. My stay wasn't until March. I cancelled with booking and checked multiple times to make sure it was indeed cancelled. I then revived a text stating that they were looking forward to my stay in March. I then called and explained that I had cancelled my reservation and they said they had no record of it and I would be charged the full amount. I have been fighting this with my bank for almost four months now. They refuse to settle this and now I'm going to be out 300.00 because I was more worried about my mother's health then I was about following up and now embassy and booking has screwed me.
