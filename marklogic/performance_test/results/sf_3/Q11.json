  "text": "Let me start off with saying that I grew up in Reno and I am happy to see a longtime Reno business like Roy Fosters stay competitive.  Now with that out of the way...\n\nI was referred to Roy Fosters by my regular mechanic because he doesn't have the equipment to deal with an issue that my truck is having with its computer.   I called Fosters and asked if they could help and I was told that they could and to just \"bring it on down:.  The next day I loaded up my son and our bikes in the truck and drove down to Fosters to leave my truck for repairs.  When I went into drop off the keys and fill out the paperwork the man working the counter said he needed to check to make sure they could do the work.  He came back and said that they needed to \"check it out\" and that their subscription to the service that would fix the computer had expired.   I asked him why they told me to come down if they were unable to help  and his reply was \"Roy's out of town until Monday\"   This made no sense to me but whatever.   Then they asked me to leave the truck so they could look it over and they would get back to me with an estimate for the work that was needed.  This left me with the feeling that they were trying to bait and switch me so  I loaded my son and myself back in to the truck and that will be the last time I ever bring a vehicle to Roy Fosters Automotive.",

We headed over to the bar area to purchase the sandwich tickets, they also had a pot of chili for $6 a bowl. The sandwiches were delicious!!! My husband also enjoyed his bowl of chili. I'd definitely eat here again when we visit the central coast.",

  "text": "I have been going to Scott Dentistry for 2 Years now. Excellent dentist! I noticed that they had started providing a new service for teeth whitening, a 40% hydrogen peroxide. I had used the bleaching trays that they sell with fare results but I wanted something more powerful. \n\nI get my teeth cleaned every 3 months so I scheduled this whitening a couple days after a teeth cleaning, I wanted maximum results. When I arrived at my appointment there was some paperwork to fill out, most describing the procedure and what the expectations of undergoing the procedure. Which I really liked, because depending on the condition of your teeth the whitening could work or wouldn't. \n\nI was taken back by Mandy and was again described in detail of how the procedure was to be performed. She compared my teeth on a color wheel and gave an expectation of what the whitening would do. She was very articulate in letting me know what she was doing and what she needed me to do. I was able to do three treatments of the whitening during my appointment. Mandy notified me at the start of the side effects of the whitening (shocking feeling in my teeth) which I didn't start to feel until the end of the third treatment. Mandy told me they would go away in one to two days but mine subsided after 8 hours and using fluoride toothpaste. \n\nAfter the treatment was over we compared my teeth on the color wheel and my teeth had whitened a shade whiter. I couldn't have been happier! Later that night I was at my nephews Christmas concert and we were standing in the dark and my mom says \"boy your teeth are so white\"! Exactly what I was looking for! Totally worth the time and money. It now has been three weeks since the whitening and my fianc√© still makes comments how white my teeth are!!!",

It's a wonderfully quirky wine bar with a curated beer selection and small but always delightful menu, with vegetarian options, including a much-appreciated vegan cheese plate. Meat-eaters enjoyed their steak as much as I enjoyed the vegetarian cannellini bean soup. Plus: cocktail specials, and a charming outdoor seating area with heaters. Music too...",

  "text": "Wow!! I must say I'm very pleasantly surprised! With so many Vietnamese restaurants opening, you start to expect a lot from each new one. I came with a couple of friends tonight and shared several dishes (which is honestly the best way to do it to get a sample of the menu in one sitting).  We shared the pork belly and oxtail buns and sticky chicken wings to start off and the combination pho (brisket, steak, and meatballs), lemongrass chicken and rice, shaken steak and rice, wonton soup, Kim chi burger with sweet potato fries, and the steak and eggs for our entrees.  We weren't the biggest fans of the buns, but everything else was fantastic!  And it's quite rare for us to like so many dishes during a first visit at any new restaurant, so we were all thoroughly impressed.  The pho broth was delicious!! I'm pretty darn picky when it comes to pho, but Mint makes it very flavorful; it doesn't necessitate the addition of many condiments.  Both the shaken steak and lemongrass chicken were very tender and, again, very flavorful.  We enjoyed the Kim chi burger, but just a little more cooked for my taste.  The sweet potato fries were perfect though!!    If I had to choose my two favorite dishes, it would have to be the pho and the lemongrass chicken. YUM!  Definitely coming back for that.\n\nMint has a very eclectic decor: a mix of different textures and styles.  I was trying to find a common theme, but \"eclectic\" was the best I can describe it.  The service was great.  Very timely and efficient.  \n\nOverall, we all had an awesome first experience and will definitely be back to try more dishes!  Happy to see uptown with another quality Vietnamese restaurant.",

I also highly recommend the taste of the bayou sampler, the chicken and andouille gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and red beans and rice.  Red beans are some of the best I've had in New Orleans.  Fried alligator is very good as well, especially the creole mustard sauce it comes with.  The staff is super friendly and the place itself has a great feel to it.  And you can't beat the local right on canal st.  Shout out to my buddy Colin Kennedy who the manager at this fine establishment.  Will definitely be back with friends to try more creole cuisine in the near future!",

However, my favorite thing to order is the cheeseburger!  It's huge and crazy cheesy. They only have 2 kinds of beer on tap but it's served in ice cold mugs so it's pretty refreshing.

The place was literally empty but the staff was very friendly and helpful when I mentioned it was our first time there. \n\nI ordered a half sized cheese pizza in the \"round\" shape option (as opposed to the \"square\" shaped option which I thought was a little odd you had to choose the shape?) and the portion size was generous. \n\nThe food was pretty good, I took home the leftovers to eat the next day. \n\nSomething I didn't like is the large metal bench that runs the length of the restaurant as seating for several tables. The ledge to sit on is really shallow and has a high, straight backrest behind it so you are literally on the edge of your seat the whole time you are sitting there. It's really uncomfortable, beware if you plan to bring elderly folks with you as they probably won't be able to sit on it. There are real chairs available too though. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty standard pizza shop, but it's in a good location and the food isn't bad.",

Great thumbs up for that!\nThe 4-star rating is all due to the food.\nI ordered the classic Cuban since it should be the signature dish. I hate to be so snobby but this is not a cheap cheap place with around $10 per sandwich. The portion size is huge for sure, but I really expected the ingredients can be better.\nThe texture of the bread is nice but so lacking good flavor.\nThe mustard and cheese are ok.\nThe roasted pork and ham have a dampened taste instead of pleasant porky aroma.\nAltogether, it is just a really bland sandwich (in terms of flavor but not salt) \n\nI also tried the special rice sides called Moros. The bacon bits are lovely but spice is a little overpowering.\n\nOverall, maybe it's just me that I am not a big fan of Cuban cuisine in general. But I feel it is a little bit overrated.",

There were many missed details that were guaranteed over the phone and were not even touched. After several pics were sent to the owner and a few phone calls, a second crew was sent out a couple days later to remedy the first crew's poor cleaning. Mediocre at best. Oh btw, they don't have vacuums with hoses, they don't vacuum couches, I don't think they have a stepladder to get to high (6ft) places, like the top of a cabinet or fridge or the promised fans. I let them borrow mine... and they only seem to clean what you point out. (Why am I pointing out what I already went over with the person on the phone?, why didn't the cleaners get a list that was discussed?)

They don't offer any tickets until the party arrives which is a huge disappointment and ridiculous there was no real staging area.\nThe pool was highly chlorinated which hurt for hours after we left. The locker area needs more benches/seats to disrobe. \nThe staff was very vanilla, nothing that leaves an impression.\nThe only good thing about this place was the price.",

  "text": "it was snowing. so of course, i had to get some ice cream. this being my first time in the snow, I was well prepared with a thin cardigan, leggings and some high heeled ankle boots that only served to elevate the risk of sliding on my ass in the snow.\n\nI walked about 8 blocks from my hotel in my ill-fitted snow garb to the warmest, coziest ice cream shop I have ever been in. my husband had some hot chocolate....which they have about half a dozen different kinds.\n\nhowever, the majority of my greatness of this review is based off of one flavor: red velvet cake. Now, I have to tell you, every red velvet cake I've ever had has been dry and not that appetizing. Like its supposed to taste good, but it doesn't. However, on this occasion-- this flavor left me begging for more and I came back for a second trip down and up hill in my skimpy snow ware for red velvet ice cream.\n\namazing.",

  "text": "I was very excited for this place to open. I live down the street and mexican food is my favorite. There's not a lot of places within walking distance to even go eat at besides the usual pizza and sandwiches. However, I was a little disappointed. I'm a vegetarian so my opinion is a little bias, but the food was very average. You walk in and order on touch screens. They really need a \"build your own option\". The vegetarian options were very limited. I did however like that the veg options were pretty healthy. I went with the veg bowl which was average - filling because of the egg and quinoa but nothing special with the taste. Kinda salty too. We waited a long time for our food (considering it's supposed to \"fast\"). They didn't offer any hot sauce or anything to fill up on the side - instead they had ketchup and mustard which is just so strange for a taco place. There's additional seating upstairs, but it kind of smells like a bathroom up there. The wait staff was very friendly. \n\nI don't see myself trying this place again, it was nothing extraordinary at all.",

So nice and helpful since they have a great big yummy menu board. We decided on a City Sampler. We were so pleased! (They have Nehi soda!!! Just a blast from the past!)\nThe slaw is the best I have ever had. The beans, I have to admit are even better than mine. They were cooked to perfection with some brisket in them. The meats were tender and tasty. The sauces were good, the original my favorite, but in the end, I felt like it was an injustice to put sauce on any of them, since they stood up well on their own. The brisket was my favorite. The wood was piled high outside and the smell of the fire was just heavenly. \nOn to the nice people! Even though you go up to get your food, we were so kindly attended to. We went at a slow time, which is our typical dinner time. I can imagine the place gets really busy though. \nThe atmosphere was very fitting for a barbecue place. I love the barbecue history on the wall. I love the wood and the aluminum ceiling. \nWe got our food very quickly, but in NO WAY was this fast food. Just well prepared, easy to serve and cooked to perfection. The prices, considering what we got were frankly amazing. I am marking this as under $10 per person, but we don't get drinks, so factor that in. \nI could keep going, but I have banana pudding to try! I get the feeling they are going to get to know my husband and I very well!",

Unfortunately it is on a side street off of Bustleton and is easy to miss.

  "text": "This was our second time at TBBC.  The first time we went for drinks and apps and that's what we should have done this time.\n- When we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand.  We didn't wait that long but when the hostess walked up she literally just stared at us.   I mean, she didn't say a word.  No greeting, no welcome, nothing.  Zero, zip, nada.   VERY strange behavior for a hostess.   She actually never said anything so we finally told her we had a party of six and she took us to a table.   The table she took us too was crammed into a corner and was just a very uncomfortable fit.   We asked if we could move to another table, a round one up by the bar, and you would have thought we'd asked her for a kidney.   She seemed so put out and exasperated that we would asked to be moved.  \n- Our group ordered appetizers, which were good.  Nothing spectacular though...yummy cheese and mustard sauces for the, obviously, frozen pretzels.  The salsa was okay, chips, meh.  Hands down, Chili's has the best chips around.   Several of our party tried the beer flights, which they really enjoyed.   \n- This is the first time we've ever eaten inside, and we did not have this when we ate outside the previous time, but they brought bottles of cold water, about the size of a wine bottle, to your table, where water glasses already sat.   They kept replenishing the bottles throughout the meal.  A cute concept but had to keep asking for ice (they brought one glass, to be shared with the table).  Like I said, cute concept, but again, I personally prefer ice water and don't want to have to keep asking for ice during my meal.  \n- The food.  Ahhh, where to begin?    I had a cup of their beer cheese soup, which, WAS tasty, but it just seemed to be lacking something.   Which, honestly, pretty much sums up everything there.   I ordered the Southwest Black Bean Burger with a side of fries (fries, at the recommendation of our server, over the white-cheddar mashed potatoes).    This was truly one of the most BLAH burgers I have ever eaten.  If I had not asked for onion on it, I don't think it would have had ANY taste.  The guacamole cr√®me on the burger had NO taste, at all.   I think it was just pureed avocado, with nothing else added.   Another thing, and this is just my personal preference, the buns are ciabatta and I just don't like ciabatta buns for a burger.   I like a good, old-fashioned, sesame-seed topped hamburger bun.   I only ate about a third of the burger and left the rest.  The fries were completely non-descript; McDonald's fries are a 1,000 times better.  My boyfriend ordered their Red-Eye burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare; it was served well-done with SO much extras glopped on, he had to eat it with a fork.  He, however, got some fancy ketchup for his fries, which I did not.   The fancy ketchup still couldn't disguise the fact that the fries were so blah.\n- Overall, a very lacking and disappointing experience.    We would definitely not go back for a meal, and not even sure if we would for apps and drinks.  Personally, I don't care for craft beer and there are many other places to go with better drink offers and better apps.",

I have to agree that the sushi is absolutely scrumptious, fulfilling and the portion size is great! The reason I'm giving it a 3 star is due to the fact of the unprofessionalism and disrespect of a kitchen staff that was visible to the front of the bar. I believe his name is Felipe and, clearly he didn't know I spoke Spanish but, everything coming out of his mouth was ruining our experience.",

  "text": "Getting tired of the same restaurants and Happy Hours at Streets of Saint Charles?! Me too! Thank goodness for a new place to eat at.. \nI will be honest, I was skeptical of this \"steakhouse\" opening because I thought the prices would be high but the prices are comparable if not lower than the other restaurants at Streets. \nThe Happy Hour is by far the best in the area. Several drinks ranging from $5-7. Appetizers/small plates ranging from $5-7. The Mahi tacos were certainly my favorite part of the trip, cooked perfectly with a delicious avocado salsa and scrumptious sauce on top. I tried the black diamond martini upon the waitress' request and I was not disappointed-- it was simply amazing! We also tried the pretzel and beer cheese dip, shrimp tacos, and buffalo style chicken tenders-- all of which were delicious. The beer cheese dip wasn't AS incredible as the rest but the competition was steep! Someone has to come in last place, right?\nThe service was phenomenal!! Catherine was our server and she couldn't have made a better first impression. My friend is quite the talker and Catherine did well entertaining my friend while remaining attentive, professional, and friendly.  Rich, the manager, and Earl, the chef, stopped by the table to make sure my friend and I were satisfied. They were very pleasant as well. \nThe atmosphere and decor is beautiful. We sat in the \"Firebar\" by the fireplace which was comfortable and relaxing. \nThey certainly set the bar high tonight, I hope the newness doesn't wear off.",

  "text": "My husband was co-chairman of a charity Golf event at Feather Sound and we could not be more pleased with the outcome.   We worked closely with Francine Burruezo and Robert \"Rob\" Spiars. \n\nThe venue is amazing, has been recently remodeled but it pales in comparison to the staff.  They had a member event in the AM, a child's birthday party, a member birthday party in the evening and still got everyone where they needed to be without issue.  \n\nThey made suggestions to make our event better and provided much help behind the scenes.  \n\nFrancine's smallest suggestion was listened to because of the expertise she displayed.   She was able to rely on wait staff, the dining and bar staff to execute her plan flawlessly. Her faith in their professionalism made us trust them to do their jobs.  \n\nRob managed the golfers and our lack of skill without a hiccup. Even when he was out of town he returned correspondence promptly and professionally.  As carts were returned from the Members event, they appeared clean and ready for our event.   Rob made sure Aaron and his other staff were aware of our first time organizer needs and took great care of our volunteers and guests. Rob personally updated scoring info into the evening to make it all happen just as the sun was setting.  \n\nAs soon as their work was done, they faded into the background so we could take all the credit.  \n\nThe wait, golf and kitchen staff were courteous, kind and provided endless help throughout the day.  Every time I turned around there was a neatly dressed Feather Sound Staff member helping out our volunteers and guests. \n\nThe Members as well were welcoming at every turn on the course or in the clubhouse.  \n\nIn all we raised much more funds for our charity due to the excellence of the staff and facility.",

I ordered the hot chicken and was expecting crispy fried chicken with a kick. Instead I got 2 small pieces of crispless chicken with no heat. There was nothing hot about this chicken, literally and figuratively.  The white bread that supposedly comes with dish was pitiful. I didn't even notice the bread and further more it was super soggy after being drenched in a forgettable season less ranch sauce that served no purpose since the chicken wasn't spicy.\n\nAfter the whack chicken I ordered dessert as I was still super hungry. I got the red velvet cake which was decent. It was moist with the right amount of crumble, and was not overly sweet. \n\nI have to say that if I come back to Fat Ham it will be for dessert and not much else.",

We discovered this place early on and it has remained a favourite since our arrival.  I am only half joking when I tell people that we bought our home in Oliver to stay within walking distance of this place.  It's truly fantastic.\n\nThe salads?  Outstanding.  Every single one.  And I have tried all the vegetarian ones.  The appetizers?  Delicious.  Again, every vegetarian one.  Desserts?  Spectacular.  All of them.  (We sometimes even walk to Famoso just to get a scoop of their gelato).  The wine?  Fantastic.  Every recommendation from the staff has been spot on.  The coffee?  Sublime.\n\nBut the main reason we come here is for the pizza.  It is simply wonderful.  Their thin crust is crisp, yet pliable, always cooked to perfection.  And every pizza combination we have tried has been superb (and we have tried every vegetarian pizza, in both red sauce and white sauce - I love that you can switch up the sauces!).  Their seasonal pizzas are always top-notch as well.  \n\nWe've never been disappointed when coming to Famoso, oh, except when the line is longer than we were hoping.  But an hour to wait for this meal is worth it!  Totally worth it.",

Our servers were amazing and so helpful in suggestions. We started with the fried green tomatoes. So yummy. Next was the BBQ shrimp. Oh my goodness. The sauce... save your bread they bring to the table with the butter to dip in this sauce. You get two pieces with the dish but more is needed to soak up the last drop. Bowl is worth licking if no one is looking. We then got the fried oyster appetizer and another super tasty dish. Simple but amazing. We finished with the white chocolate brownie that was suggested by our server as her favorite. She didn't steer us wrong. Another amazing dish at Mr. B's.

I walked in around 10:30 and walked up to the counter and was told the kitchen was closed. Talk about feeling bummed out after looking over their tasty menu options. We were standing outside for about 10 minutes and got called back in because the kitchen was some how opening. I am not sure what happened, but I am sure glad I was able to order my Belgian waffle. I added bananas and chocolate chips for a .50 cent up charge and it took the waffle to the next level. The waffle is made with a cinnamon vanilla buckwheat batter and topped with walnuts and syrup. The waffle also comes with a side and I went with the bacon of course. It was nice thick and crispy. You can tell they only use the freshest of ingredients. The coffee mugs are a pretty decent size which allowed me to enjoy more of my peach white tea. \n\nWhat I thought made this cafe unique was that it served beer. This isn't your typical coffee shop. They have something for everyone. You also order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when its ready. The interior was very modern chic. I loved the tufted benches and light fixture in the larger dining area. They also have a really neat patio and lots of tables inside. I would recommend this place if you are looking to grab a quick breakfast.",

You must go to the bar to order everything and the 1 food runner/buser was not good at all about coming and cleaning off dirty dishes from the tables. I carried most of our dirty plates away myself b/c we ran out of room on the table. Yuck! Let's work on the service aspect guys.\n\n- The food is not that great. I would give the food 2.5 stars after multiple visits. \n\nPros \n\n- Awesome atmosphere. The bartender got up and sang a song with the band. Pretty laid back and friendly all around. \n\n- Kick ass, huge patio/beer garden in the summer, and they have live bands out there too. Always a fun time! \n\n- They host multiple beer festivals throughout the year.\n\n- Obviously, fantastic locally made micro brews.

You come here because it has an awesome atmosphere and puts you in the mood to let loose and party. Their take on tex mex isn't bad but it's nothing to write home about. However, I do love their salsa and I usually fill up on chips and salsa before I even get my entree. Their margaritas while kinda pricey certainly pack a punch!",

  "text": "Thanks to earlier reviews, we somewhat know what to expect. We would have given 5 stars for the food, but the service was so poor that we had to take 1 away. Pluses: We got drunken noodles and Thai pacific noodles, both tasted fantastically!  Minuses: \n1. the restaurant is extremely shortly staffed. We were told there was only 1 person making the food, and as we can see, only 1 person running the table. It took a really long time for our food to come out (more than 30 minutes). When we stopped the waitress to add an appetizer, her replies were \"uh oh... we only have 1 chef so it won't come out for a while\"\n2.  When we arrived, the 5 of us were seated at a round table. But we were rudely moved to a smaller table after we placed our orders, saying that she meant to reserve that table for a group of 8, who never showed up the entire time we were there. We felt that the waitress just shooed us and moved us as we were inconveniencing her. She was rude and lacks any sign of hospitality you'd least expect from any restaurant. When we were ordering food, I asked to only have bok choy, and no other vegetables, but I'd take whatever extra they're willing to give me, which was when I was told that it was going to cost extra. \n3. Again, thanks to earlier review, I warned my husband to double check the bill before he pays for it. Sure enough, we were charged for one extra plate. \nWe're only visiting Nashville for a couple of nights. We would consider coming back due to the quality of the food, but we hope that the service would at least improve to normality then.",

Decent crowd of people, (they don't throw full beer cans at opposing fans) food and beer wasn't bad. I only took off one star because Eagles fans totally suck :p I hope one day Philadelphia will not tolerate the behavior that goes on next door.

It is now just covered up with some cardboard snack stands.\n\nFood wise they have some good options including vegan burritos and veggie packs. \nThey also have pizzas, burgers and chicken wings! I'm not sure how fresh they are, but they come out hot and are heated daily. Not Wawa, but pretty good.\n\nIf you like snacks they have some healthier options like whole grain chips and nuts. They also have a great variety f candies and the traditional snacks like chips, popcorn and soft pretzels. \n\nThey have a really good donut selection and they are based upon promotions at times. Their donuts are better than Wawa. Their drink selection is crazy good. Vitamin water,energy drinks, soda, juices. They usually have deals like 2 drinks for a $1. Of course they have slurpees.\n\nThey also have an Amazon locker here. \n\nThe staff here is very friendly and are great at stopping backup in the lines. They are polite and know customer relations.\n\nThis location formerly a Wawa. This 7-Eleven isn't Wawa, but they do a good job!",

  "text": "The Whitney Bank on Harrison Avenue has undergone serious staffing changes over the past few years.  First, there was the replacement of long time employee Dianne.  Now, neither Mary Ann nor Susan work here any more.\n\nI know that many of you, perhaps most of you, go to the bank simply to conduct business transactions.  And for the most part, that goes the same for me.  But the main reason I chose to go back to Whitney Bank upon my return from California, was the awesome personnel at the Harrison Avenue location; specifically Susan, Dianne and Mary Ann.\n\nNow that all three are gone, I can honestly say that the lobby is a much duller and colder place.  Other than the obligatory greeting by the new tellers, I no longer get that warm and fuzzy feeling that I used to.  Perhaps this specific location was unique among financial institutions.  All I know is that I miss the human touch that used to exist here.  Sure, the new tellers are all polite, but the old regime knew all of its clientele and spoke to them about their families while business was being conducted.  It truly was an enjoyable experience.\n\nI am still satisfied with the service I receive, and I plan to remain a Whitney customer.  However, I now see my infrequent visits here as strictly business and uneventful.  For most, I guess this is enough.  For me, not so much.",

Our server seemed rushed even though we were the only two in the place but he was kind and knowledgeable. They bring fresh bread to your table and the menu is extensive and informative. My husband got the raw oyster appetizer and said they were cold, fresh and good.  I got the calamari app and they were seasoned well, hot and came with tasty marinara sauce. For dinner, I got the stuffed chicken in mushroom gravy. It was very good but I'd say the portion was fairly small. My husband got the split porkchop and he loved it. My husband also got a glass of the \"Andrea's\" red wine and said it was delicious. Give this place a chance, don't just go off of the bad reviews. We will definitely be back.",

And luckily guy had insurance AND pulled over to give info. (yes Hit and Runs happen even in Paradise)\nWent to one place for an estimate, but didn't seem busy and as professional bit 'rough around edges' let say.\n\nWent down street and found Iron Horse.\n\nAtmosphere:  \nCraig greeted me as I came in. Nice man in a tie and dress shirt. We chatted a few minutes about V -Town (Ventura) and football. Very amiable man.\n\nWhat struck me, which I told him, was the array of cars behind the glass window and the fellas working on them. Yes they needed repairs, but for as many cars and guys as there were it didn't come off as a oily auto shop. (not that there is anything wrong with that of course!)\n\nService: Excellent. I knew they would have it for several days. And it was finished on the day he estimated. Also dealt with the insurance company which I appreciated.\n\nPricing: I really didn't do any comparison to be honest. In truth the insurance was handling it.\n\nSummary:\nI passed by the car when I came back to pick it up. Why? It looked: So- Damn- Good. The bumper was new, paint exactly matched what I had. Absolutely recommend Craig and Iron Horse, for anyone but especially ladies.",

I thought my room was well priced at 139/night, but that is below the normal price since we were part of a wedding guest block. The hotel staff were also very nice without being over the top. \n\nI only have two minor criticisms and I'd still recommend this hotel overall. First, the breakfast buffet is ridiculously expensive - 16 dollars for continental and a whole 35 dollars if you want anything hot. The food was good, but not 35 bucks for breakfast good! Walk to City Tap House for brunch instead. \n\nThe other criticism is an unfortunate circumstance rather than anything the hotel is doing wrong, but it still affects the experience - the street/block the hotel is on does not smell good. Something was up with the sewer or something. Hopefully it's not always like that. Fortunately our room was on the twentieth floor and the street level smell was not an issue there.",

  "text": "A decent hotel near the Vieux Carr√© and in the up and coming Warehouse District. And with a brand new bar and restaurant just opened in the lobby it makes for a convenient start or end to your day. Plus the Coffee and Beignet Co. breakfast annex to the side has some tasty pastries and snacks as well as some of the best beignet in Nola, without the lines. \n\nThe rooms are adequate for anyone's needs, good sized with a fridge and safe included. A rooftop pool and small gym make a morning workout relatively easy, probably necessary after the excesses the city is known for. Wifi was not included in the room so we had to go to the lobby to use the guest access. Our room overlooked the lobby from the 4th floor and on the 2nd day I discovered that the wifi signal was strong enough to reach there.\n\nWe booked on one of the big online travel websites so also got a good deal for the stay. Initially wanting to stay in the Vieux Carr√©, we did not find the rooms we needed,  and settled, we thought, on this hotel outside the demarcation. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as that area is a horrible place to stay unless you want to be in congested streets and around inebriated guest 24/7. Here taxis are quick to find, with speedy route access to other parts of the city and nearby trolley car accessibility much easier as well. Added bonus was that Rouses Market was an 8 minute walk away - the Nola equivalent of Whole Foods with far better prices and full of local products. \n\nI'll be back.",

Guys show up, Greg, Michael and Steve, all consummate professionals and found solutions for the various stupid design decisions in my house & attic. If I could give you more stars, I would. I'm going to sleep well tonight for the first time since last Sunday and I have Family Air to thank. These will be the guys I call from now on when I have an HVAC issue.",

  "text": "30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very \"movie like\" LOL.  \n\nClean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. \n\nPlus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. \n\nP.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!",

The macaroni and cheese. It tasted like it was made out of a box. And the beans had to much sauce in them. To where you could not even get the enjoyment out of eating the beans because the sauce was so over powering. \n\nAnother thing about this restaurant I did not like was this. They do not serve mash potatoes or at least a baked potatoe with your barbecue. What kind of barbecue restaurant does that. I am from Texas, I know what real barbecue is about.",

  "text": "District, your staff is always super nice. The owner who is always there is also very nice and always greets us. Your coffee is good and that Miso Praline breakfast sandwich is like the blood of virgins between two biscuits. One of my favorite things to eat. Ever. Your donuts are always a treat, who doesn't like a damn donut? Maybe a gluten free vegan? But what the hell do they like anyway....\n\nContrary to what I just wrote, I don't really visit anymore. We got really sick of paying close to $30 to get breakfast from a donut shop that isn't full service. Also, the last time we went there I called in an order and waited in line to get it. While I was in line, I saw a lady tap a man and his daughter on the shoulder while they were eating their donuts and ask them, \"Excuse me, is that good?\" First of all, let this man enjoy a donut with his child in peace. Secondly, what the hell do you think? It's a chocolate donut filled with rice pudding. You like donuts? You like chocolate? You like rice pudding? Badda fucking Bing Bozo! It's a $2.50 investment. Donuts are like a roll in the hay, even when it's bad, it's good. \n\nClearly that experience made me realize that my neighborhood donut shop is frequented by tourists with dumb questions and intrusive behavior. I'll probably go back at some point on a slow day, but if anyone interrupts my snarfing session with a dumb question about a glazed donut, I'll let one out that's so vile, the whole place will be forced to evacuate.",

Honeys is a hip-sty cool spot with close seating & fun bar area.\nChalkboard menus adorn the walls with daily specials. Diner glass domes of sweets line the counter along with refreshed coffee cups and chatting locals. \n\nI love the laid back atmosphere of Honey's. The hostess was friendly and offered menus for kiddos and sat us right away. Our server was as laid back as can be but friendly.\n\nWe ordered the well known potato latkes with sour cream. These are fantastic and a must order. Crispy on the outside, squishy potato mash on the inside. My 8 year old devoured his immediately.\n\nLa Columbe coffee served here. A++ for that!\n\nKids had the egg sandwich on brioche bun & single pancake filled with chocolate. Pancakes are huge so for kiddos one is more than enough. My kids polished their plates... Thumbs up from the mini peeps.\n\nMy husband had the French toast special which was caramelized coconut & banana. Holy moly.. Yum! Gooey and sweet.\n\nI had the Toad In Hole which was by far my favorite. Hollandaise soaked Challah bread with a poached egg in the center topped with melted Jack cheese and truffle oil. Served with a side of spicy arugula with a tart lemon vinaigrette. To die for. The flavors were amazing together and the portion was just enough. \n\nOverall good experience. Only downside was we saw a couple come in and they sat so long without being served that they got up & walked out. Sadly they missed out on a crazy good toad in hole!",

Have been taking our cars to them since 2000 and could never switch to another because we KNOW what we are getting here...top notch service at fair prices, not the cheapest, but fair. Jamie is so knowledgeable, passionate about his business, as well as caring. He works with us on what is really needed and tells us what we can wait for which we appreciate being on a tight budget. \n\nHe has worked on all makes & models--we've taken to him both American and Foreign cars, trucks and an old minivan. He keeps us on the road with good regular maintenance and when we need a new used car he checks it over for us to make sure it's worthy. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about Jamie is one time we had a really awesome (my opinion) older Acura. Had I not known, I'd just keep pouring money into it b/c I loved it. But Jamie said it was time to rebuild the engine and he wouldn't bother doing that because of the cost to value ratio. He recommended finding a new used car. Smart man. Thank you Jamie for so many years of awesome service!",

  "text": "One of the best brunch spots in town.  Get there early though because the secret was out long ago. Trying to get in on a sat/sun around 11-1 and you are probably looking at an hour plus wait. Why is it so popular? It probably has to do with the 2-4-1 cocktails, or maybe the red velvet waffles with cream cheese drizzle, or perhaps it's the signature \"white trash hash\"... a delicious concoction of cheese, hash browns, and scallions rolled into an almost crispy-shelled ball of tasty delight.  They have takes on all the traditional brunch classics as well... a variety of egg/benedict themed plates, waffles, and of course biscuits.  \n\nWhat I really like is that for all the heavy brunch menu items they have there is also a whole \"skinny\" section devoted entirely to those who are taking it light and counting calories. An egg white scramble, yogurt, and salads are among some of the things you will find on that menu. The brunch libations don't really pull any punches even though drinks are buy one get one free. Bloody Marys, trumped up Mimosas, and my favorite, the red berry sangria. \n\nMy advice is to get there right when they open at 10am. There will be a few people already lined up but you won't wait.  You'll be glad you did because by the time you leave the waiting area will be packed and you'll be able to walk out happy knowing you didn't have to sit through all that mess.",

We lucked out that day because everything was tasty delicious. everybody has their on off days. some days everything the chef makes is on point & their are some days when everything tastes alil off. i recommend the fried Mac & cheese. hands down, yummilicious! I'm not quite a meat eater but my fianc√© is & he liked the Trainwreck very much. bread was just right. it was crispy on the outside & moist on the inside, was not soggy which is really important in my opinion. I'm not really a gumbo person but it was good. had enough kick to it & it wasn't too salty. if I could eat til my heart is content & not gain any weight, I would be eating here every week.",

You're at one of the many bars/nightclubs where you're squeezing through people, desperately trying to reach the bar, gasping for air, all the while some gangsta is dissin' your fly girl.  You regret that you have agreed to come to this area again, and you regret that you, probably, paid a man outside to be in that situation.  Everything sucks and you know you aren't hooking up with any of those girls that probably just threw up.\n\nDo what I do when in such peril, head to the Irish P≈çl.  Upon entering, normality is restored to my psyche.  There is the bar.  Walk up to it without putting an elbow into someone's back.  There's beer, many beers.  35-40 of them, all different, all on tap.  There's a small menu consisting of all things golden, fried, and delicious.  Don't bother wading through the crowd looking for your buddy or significant other.  They're lost for good and someone will spill something on you.  Just duck out and head for the P≈çl.",

  "text": "A trip to St Louis would not be complete without a stop to Ted Drewe's Frozen custard in the historic Dogtown neighborhood. This St Louis icon is perched right next to the famed route 66 Highway. Its fa√ßade is classically retro, of the same caliber we often associate with structures that aligned this national highway. Everything about this place is nostalgic, sweet, and distinctively American. The Frozen Custard is simply perfect! The taste is so rich, pure, and creamy. With a large variety of flavors to choose from you can't go wrong. The portions are very generous. The large size is more than enough, you'll see when you get there, but nonetheless, if you are new to St Louis, or visiting, please make this a stop on your tour. We made this a destination after visiting the Botanical Gardens and it definitely hit the spot. If you love ice cream, you GOTTA COME HERE!!",

  "text": "So I visited for the first time.  If there is something that ticks me off it is bad business sense.  So I ordered two tacos, the super burrito and chips and salsa for $3.50 for the chips and salsa.  A good Mexican meal requires chips and salsa. Let's forget the fact that they charged me for something I can get free at most Mexican restaurants.  To pay 3.50 you would think home made maybe? Heated? Something special?  No.  From the bag super cheap chips.  And the salsa came in this ketchup condiment small cup.  The chips wouldn't even fit in the salsa holder.  So I barely could get the salsa on my chip.  Because of the size, even with little salsa on each chip I had over half my chips and had run out of salsa.  So I go up and ask for more salsa.  $.25 more was the response.  Then she clarified, no $.50.  So something I get for free, normally with beans for free, I pay for anyway and now I can't get a refill without money.  I don't carry cash, and nobody wants to rerun their card for some odd amount of pocket change.  So then my food comes.  Chorizo taco was okay at best, and I kept thinking about no salsa for my chorizo either.  So then I eat the steak taco.  The whole time I'm staring at a half full basket of chips and no salsa.  The steak was dry and tasted funny.  Then I start in on the super burrito.  Man, if only I had salsa to put on it.  It was average at best.  In part, this place lost my business for life over $.50 and really $3.50 (I can get a freaking burrito almost for that cost).  Let's be honest.  We have plenty of Mexican food options in the valley, and For all that offer free chips and salsa with beans and refills why would I come back to this place when the food is comparable at best.",

After traveling 9 hours to this hotel and having received a confirmation email from Expedia within the past 48 hours, we arrived at The Alexander only to be told unapologetically at the front desk that they were overbooked and there was no room for us.

It is slightly cramped. \nWhen you get there, they put towels, yes towels, over you, so anything you spill, can just go on that. Then you wash you hands, and then the food starts. \nThe food was in enormous portions, given we were just three of us, but we enjoyed all the courses! The chicken in the phyllo dough was unexpectedly delicious! the mix of sweet with the chicken flavors was great! The next course of chicken was so tender, it just came off the bone. The lamb was the next course and wow, loved it! \nOfcourse dessert was fruit and baklava...and the baklava gave me my full rush on sugar, and rightly so.

  "text": "This message is to inform the owners of this bar that I will be pursuing legal action against the bar based on my experience with the workers on Saturday, December 28. I visited the bar and had no problems until early into the morning of the 29th, when a worker physically assaulted me on the premises. She had been offended by my behavior, and rather than addressing her frustrations with me in a professional manner, she approached me and began to shove me. I physically did not react; rather, I left the bar when asked. I expressed confusion at the physical confrontation and was met by the manager with the answer that customers can be expelled without reason, \"honey.\" His response was vague and sexist on top of his worker's inappropriate behavior.\n\nTo be transparent about the issue, I can tell you that the woman who attacked me had been frustrated by the fact that I was joining other karaoke singers on stage without signing up (I had asked the singers if they minded my joining them; they told me the more, the merrier). I was ultimately removed from the stage by the workers, who allowed other people on stage who weren't on the docket. I complied, and when I  later asked why others were allowed to crash the stage but I wasn't, the workers told me it was because the other people were friends. Because of this unfair treatment, I was angry and made an inappropriate gesture to express my frustration. Admittedly, my reaction was inappropriate-- but it was not violent. About five minutes later, the worker began to push me around. \n\nI understand that businesses reserve the right to refuse service to customers for their own reasons, but physical assault in this case was absolutely unnecessary and unwarranted. I have many witnesses who can attest to my nonviolence in this situation, and I hope that your establishment has video recordings to also back my claims.\n\nYour manager mentioned the bar had had a rough night. None of this had anything to do with me, and it's a completely unacceptable excuse for a working professional to lay hands on a paying customer.  The mature and professional way of handling this would have been for the worker to simply ask me to leave the bar, without any bullying or physical assault.",

  "text": "Well, well, well...Cunningham Restaurant Group strikes again!  They are on fire and setting the rest of Indy on fire with them.  First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. \"This place would make a great business\" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.  We had the livery which is more of the standard and the carriage house which is more Texas, which is understating it because both are made with more than average ingredients.  Both were fantastic drinks! Upon being seated we were served some house made chicharones that were a nice crisp accented with a lime flavor that went well with our margaritas. I'm going to skip to the dessert because it blew us away!  The apple flan is a bit of culinary genius.  The texture was a silky smooth bit of creamy perfection served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side with a little garnish of a sweet cooked apple slice topped with I believe candied Marcona almonds. Yes, it tasted even better than it sounds.  They are making their desserts in house, and that includes the freaking ice cream.  I can't wait to see what kind of ice cream concoctions they come up with.  It's not my intention to take away from the small plates because we were not disappointed with our choices.  We shared the ceviche and the chicken empanadas.  Both were flavorful and delicious to the last bits. Lastly, Michael, Lee, and Phillip were all so very friendly and took the time to speak with us throughout our visit.  Throw all of this together with the very warm welcome we received as well as the very attentive service, and we had a spectacular Livery experience.",

This review will focus on the convenient store aspect as opposed to the refueling services on offer.\n\nNo coconut water, but lots of sugary options for beverages, which was disheartening. They had the Advil I was in search of. GF couldn't open packaging, obviously not Valero's fault, but still, I won't let that fact spoil this review. \n\nI can see how some of the other reviewers claims of unfriendly employees came to be. Part of me also thinks they're just a touch too taciturn, but not gonna hate on that. To them I say \"mahalo\". \n\nMay refuel here later on today, if so, will report back.",

  "text": "So, this adorable little secret \" Fancy Parlor\" themed lounge was the 2nd stop on our anniversary night out in Philly. Finding this secret gem is no joke- if you are in the area of 20th and Chestnut, and its around 8 pm, you may see people looking at the GPS on their phones, walking back and forth in front of a spice shop.....this may be your first hint that you are in the right place! (because, there is NO sign!)\n\nUpon first impression, after patting myself on the back for finding this hidey-hole, all the while pretending that i knew it was there 'the entire time, duh' to my hubs, i am transported back in time to 1974 in my grandmothers 'front parlour' - couches with the wooden scrolls for arms, portraits of unknown family members leering down at me from the walls, and  dusty knick knacks of mysterious origin. \n\nWe are the 2nd couple waiting for a seat. The place is half full, and the hostess if completely perplexed on how to seat 2 groups of 2, that want to sit separately. She scans the room- loveseats, couches, club chairs, window seating....the options are endlessly charming, however beyond overwhelming for the hostess. After the other couple decides to cross the street for an entree ( 1 Tippling only serves munchies up to a certain time) the hostess heaved a great sigh of relief and sat us in a quiet corner overlooking the bar. \n\nThe waitress was in no hurry to 'get us fed and out' as some places are...when she finally took our order and we got our drinks -him a frothy 'Gentlemans Buck' and for me 'Dragons Tear'  (that Khaleesi drink!) we settled in for people watching, drinking,  and enjoying our time together. There is a relaxed \"homey, hang out awhile\" vibe to this place.\n\nThe decor matches the vibe of this joint. \nSit down, relax, drink, laugh....drink a bit more... really relax into\nthat comfy chair....oh, there's the waitress....well, ok maybe one more\nof those dragon tear things.....all served in fun vintage glasses.\n\nHubs and I were definitely the oldest in the room; it reeks of yuppie and Tory Burch, yet we had a great time drinking cocktails that went down way to easily, guessing what the stories behind some of the groupings were, and  showing the young-in's how to' date' after being married for 27 years.\n\n1 Tippling is like being welcomed into a new, yet familiar ritual..fancy cocktails before or after dinner at your aunts house. If you can find it, go.",

  "text": "First off, let me say that my husband and I have been going there about once a week since they opened several months ago. We always sit at the bar since we always go pretty late after work and there is never a wait to sit there. Our experience always depends on who is working behind the bar. As a restaurant owner, I am very understanding that sometimes people have a hard time separating what they are going through in their personal lives from their attitudes at work and it's not always fair to judge someone on a bad day. However, last night the bartender was so rude, all we wanted to do was leave and I wish we had sooner. We came in about 10:30, not realizing that they close at 11:00. There was no one else at the bar so it was just us she had to wait on. She never welcomed us or smiled once, keeping a look of disgust on her face even when I tried to make light conversation with her. She had waited on us before so I knew a little about her history and know that she is transferring to a new store in California soon. Trying to lighten things up I said, \"you're still here, you haven't left yet?\" just curious if she was still headed to Ca. She said, \"Unfortunately, I am\" and said nothing else. My husband asked for a second drink and she took his glass poured the drink and handed it back and took off to the kitchen. My husband quickly noticed that she didn't put any ice in it so we just sat and waited, when she finally came back my husband asked if he can have ice in his $7 drink and she added ice with no apologies. After a few minutes having had my food in front of me and just a minute or so after my husband had his food she asked me if I wanted a \"small box\" for my food. I don't think she had looked at my plate because I hadn't touched it and it was a large plate of food. I said, \"not yet, are you about to close?\" to which she replied, \"We closed seven minutes ago!\". I looked at my phone and realized that it was 11:07. Even though we had just gotten our food and she just poured a glass of wine at this point I had had enough and I was ready to leave. I said, \"I am really sorry. I am not sure if you remember but we are the people that own a couple restaurants and we tip well, I didn't realize that you close at 11:00. She replied, \"I don't care at all about the tip!\" I asked her for boxes and we hurried to get out of there. Overall, it was just a bad experience. I would give it one star but that's not fair to the other bartenders there that have been really nice. Most are really nice. I don't know what we did to deserve to be treated like that. Even if we came in 10 minutes to closing I would never expect that. As restaurant owners, we gladly welcome any customers until we are closed. I am sure of the time we came in because my mother called when we were on Mallory at 10:24 PM. I wish her good luck at the new store and hopefully this was just a onetime thing.",

We explained to the waitress how other hibachi grills just give our food before they add the  extra sodium for everyone else. The waitress began to cut us off when we were talking and left us high and dry in the middle of our conversation to get the manager. We decided to leave at this point and went to the front where the manager was to pay for our drinks. One of the people in my party told the manager they never drank their drink. The manager who was equally rude gave us an attitude as we were signing our receipt for all drinks and said what do you expect us to do give it to someone else? We never implied they should give it to another. We were just unsatisfied with the surface and didn't drink anything and wanted to leave. Usually managers calm such situations instead of adding more fuel to the fire. Way to go!

As a pizza connoisseur, I should have known better than to order from a chain,  especially when the yelp reviews lacked sufficient descriptions of the pizza (so many comment just say things like \"great pizza\" or \"good food\"). I ordered, online,  the special that included a one-topping pizza, bread sticks, and drinks and had it delivered;  my pizza was a thin-crust spicy pepperoni.  The good: The delivery was  relatively fast, the food was warm, pepperoni was plentiful, and the delivery guy was nice, which is why I can't give it a 2 or 1. The bad: the pizza tastes JUST LIKE domino's thin crust,  same texture, same cardboard-y-ness and the breadsticks tasted like big half-baked dough balls...I couldn't finish any of it. When I look at the reviews, I realize that I just must be a pizza snob. ..so many people like the pizza and have no complaints. Maybe these people are like my husband who just thinks \"a pizza is a pizza no matter where you go.\" Being from Chicago, I grew up with the gold mine of pizzas; I can't except that...the search continues!",

It comes with black beans and a side of plantains. Another in our party had the Ropa Vieja - shredded beef Cuban style. It too was delicious.  The sopapilla dessert was worth the calories. It is not like any others I have had - sweet, crispy dough with a cream cheese custard inside.",

Healthier breakfast sandwiches can still feel indulgent if the ingredients are treated with care and attention, and that's definitely the case here. Being able to order it in the middle of the afternoon only makes it more delicious. The pastry and coffee-lovers in my family had plenty of options to choose from, and seemed pleased with their orders. I'll definitely make this place a habit when in town.",

But what I can attest to is how pleased my taste buds were! \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the TA2, which is a large platter of pre-fixed 6 items, comprising of few different kinds of meat and veggies. We got the platter \"for one\" and thank goodness we did- the two of us struggled to finish it  (Be aware, the food is much more filling than it looks).  The goat was cooked well, and the beef was so tender and rich.  I loved the spices and unique flavors in each of the items.\n\nThe only negative thing I could think of was that the extra plates of injera were served at room temperature.  (At the place I first tried Ethiopian cuisine, they came out warm).  But it didn't ruin my experience since the food was so delicious anyways. \n\nOur waitress handled our large party like a champ and was willing to do separate checks. I know some people are a bit wary of eating only with your hands, so rest assured, they had hand sanitizers at every table!  The restaurant has a cozy ambiance, and with the Ethiopian decor and furnishings, you forget that you're in Indy.  It's a charming place, and I look forward to returning!",

If we had any complaints it's that the bathrooms are downstairs, they don't accept split checks under any circumstances and there was a big chalkboard sign for the elevator that said, 'elevator for use by those that need it only' (or something to that effect.

It was a thick sandwich, but on standard slices of white bread, so it looked so lonely not taking up much real estate in the basket. Yeah, you could at on a $4 potato salad or a drink, and soon enough you have a $17 meal. I'm not getting cheap, it just seemed chintzy to have a 4\"x5\" $10 sandwich all by itself. Give me a little something to munch on... Idk a couple grapes or a pickle or orange wedge or something.

So, one day when jonesing for sugar a fellow sugar addict and I headed off to the Bulk Barn.\n\nI purchased a few of my favorite snacks from the bins: licorice laces, gummy bears and sour cream puffs to name a few. My friend had an equally luscious load. I probably dropped about $40 and she $50. We couldn't  wait to get to the car to twist open a few bags and start the sugar rush and when we finally got the bags open wow.. what a disappointment!  My licorice laces were like eating the leather laces on my boots. I might have pulled off a crown trying to dislodge a gummy bear from my tooth and my girlfriend was dry heaving beside me. Need I say more.\n\nThoroughly disappointing. The most stale and vile junk food I have ever had the displeasure of eating. The bulk goods must have been in those bins for who knows how long ??? That coupled with the occassional grubby hands dipping into the bins to steal samples when no one was looking; disgusting. In fact it was so bad we threw it all in the garbage.\n\nI learned a costly but valuable lesson that day, and no,  it wasn't to stop eating so much junk food..lol, rather  \"To ensure freshness always buy your candy individually packaged\". \n\nBulk Barn gets a 5 popcorns down!",

Donuts looked good and the local vibe of the shop was appealing. \n\nI ordered a variety of donuts.. And was disappointed to find that all of them lacked flavor. It was hard to tell which donut was a certain flavor because they all appeared bland and boring. I would say the wedding cake donut was my favorite because the texture somewhat resembles a wedding cake. \n\nThe coffee here really stole the show. I would return for an iced coffee.. But not a donut.",

  "text": "The South Street Night Market was just another nail sealing me in my \"I'm officially too old for this sort of thing\" coffin.\n\nI made the mistake of not getting there until after 8:00, by which time the crowds barely allowed one to move down the street.  I stood in a 45-minute line to get a grilled cheese sandwich.  It was expensive, not very large and not very good.  I was still hungry, but so done with the event.\n\nOne of the perks of being old is the ability to bail (with my old person money) to a nice restaurant where I sat at a table and had other people bring food to me.  I will be leaving future night markets to the kids, who did seem to be having a lot of fun.",

  "text": "Service at this restaurant is as good as it gets.  The food is excellent.  Of course, the brews are top-notched and quality is evident in the clean taste of the beer, the clean glasses that gets served and the knowledge that the wait staff have about the beers.  I was there with my wife, my 6 month old daughter, and my sister in law.  We had numerous questions about the beers.  Our waiter, Ed, was extremely courteous, patient, and funny in a natural, easygoing manner.  That wasn't the thing that stood out from my experience at Iron Hill.  Our waiter went out of his way to get my 6 month old daughter a bowl of mashed sweet potatoes despite it not being on the menu.  Another member of the waitstaff told us it wasn't possible, but our waiter convinced the kitchen to make it for us even though it's not a complicated dish and that the sweet potatoes are already there for the sweet potatoes fries, which IS on the menu.  It's moments like this that makes an establishment stand out in my mind because they made my daughter feel comfortable and they seem extremely understanding of parents and infants.  If that wasn't it, I forgot my credit card and some of my daughter's things when we left.  They kept everything safe for me when I returned to get it.  No attitudes and no strange looks.  The folks are well trained in restaurant service and are as professional as it gets.  Kudos to the whole team there.  We will be returning soon.",

  "text": "We have been waiting for this to open for months and we were finally able to stop in for lunch. The setup is very similar to the Quiznos that was there before, so not sure why it took them so long to open.\nI got the Habanero Burrito with black beans and carnitas and my boyfriend got the Carnitas Burrito.  The food came quickly and you get a little chips and salsa while you wait (the burritos also come with chips).  There were two big problems with the burritos: 1) all of the cheese, sour cream, and guacamole were on one side and the rice, beans, and meat were all on the other.  So there was no way to get a bite with everything in it.  I would have liked the ingredients to be more evenly dispersed throughout the burrito.  2) the rice was seriously undercooked.  Every bite had several crunchy grains, but along with some perfectly cooked grains. It's like one batch of good rice got mixed in with a batch of undercooked rice.  I can get over the uneven-ness of the ingredients, but it's pretty hard to get over crunchy rice.  The flavor of the burritos was pretty good though outside of those two things.\nThe salsa is perfectly spicy, but be sure you have something to wash it down with, especially the habanero salsa.  The servings are also really big.  We had a late lunch and therefore had an even later dinner because we were STUFFED.\nI didn't notice the tamale and pupusa menu (they are behind the cash register, separate from the main menu that you see when you first walk in). I definitely have to come back to try both of these.",

The crowd is as expected in this area on a late Friday evening and a mini confrontation took place adding to the unhappy vibe of this place. All I wanted was a chocolate shake and that took almost 30 minutes to come out supposedly because they were out of whipped cream.. however there was no whipped cream on my shake when it finally came out. Onion rings and BLT sandwich were extremely average if even that.. Tables were extremely sticky.

As a visitor from the south, I was surprised to see grits on the menu (but didn't try them). They have Tabasco sauce, too. A great addition to any breakfast. In my humble, Louisiana influenced opinion. \n\nThe scrapple was fried super crispy and piping hot.  It's sliced pretty thin and almost all crust. Could be a little thicker. Everything was hot and fresh cooked. Eggs in the omelette were just a little overdone, but not yet rubbery. \"Home fries\" are good, with a crispy crust, but more a pile of potatoes somewhere between mashed and small chunks. But still pretty good. \n\nThe only distraction here is the bickering among the staff. With an open kitchen, there's just no place to hide. \n\nOverall, a good, standard diner with a good breakfast.

They also took reservations and that was a bonus because we didn't know how busy it would be on a Friday evening with a game. We got seated right away (5:45pm) and it was not busy at all but just after 6p the place started to get busy. Our server was really nice and made sure our drinks were always filled. It did not take long to get our food either. \n\nWe got the Beer Cheese Tots for our stater and this was really good. The bacon pieces were especially delicious. My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Burger. This is ground chicken with buffalo sauce. Which I really loved the idea because I was worried it would be more of a fried chicken sandwich. He also got the zucchini straws. The straws were so-so and not something we would order again but the garlic black pepper aioli that comes with the straws was absolutely delicious. The burger was just ok. It was a bit plain for me and could have used more buffalo sauce. There were some toppings missing that were listed on the menu and not a lot of the gorgonzola aioli on the burger. I got the Stanford which is their turkey burger and again kind of plain. Again there was hardly any of the tarragon mayo. The meat just didn't seem seasoned. To be fair we probably could have asked for more aioli and gotten some on the side but I hardly to do that when a restaurant is busy. If it's on the menu then it should be on the burger. I had the caesar salad as my side which is just your basic side salad. Overall I wasn't very impressed. I would probably go back just for convenience and to try one of the beef burgers but it wouldn't be something I was necessarily looking forward too after this first experience.",

Service was very good as well, we liked the atmosphere  Overall okay, but we have no plans to return.",

The measure of any business is not if they make mistakes (they will!), but how they handle them.  After politely listening to my complaint, two Lee Co. managers called back the same day with a solution that was effective and very fair.  We have used Lee Co. for a variety of services for many years, and this latest experience only reinforces our opinion that they are an excellent company to do business with.",

After that the night was utterly disappointing. Grossly understaffed which resulted in horrific service. Warm beer. The chopped salad bordered on flavorless and greasy burgers were mismatched, in attempt to be cool, messily presented on cheese boards. Bathrooms need signage. And while two people appeared to cover the entire restaurant. The other two staff members just needed coffee in their hands while they chatted in the conceptually interesting pastry bar. Place could be great but needs the talent demonstrated by the designer in the kitchen and on the floor.",

They forgot an item (not a huge deal) and the owner/manager gave us a free dessert. The pizzas are overall decent, but flavors a bit weak (bland cheese, tart sauces) and (as others have noted) some corners cut in the quality of ingredients (e.g. less-than-ripe tomatoes in the peak local tomato season). Greek salad sort of bland and sterile too. The counter-ordering arrangement is nice and casual, but gets a bit chaotic the more people are waiting. So overall okay.",

I contacted the general manager in advance and found her to be rather rude, unaccommodating, and not very Nashville-like overall.

  "text": "An unimpressive breakfast establishment with mediocre service and food.\n\nMy friends and I wanted to find a sit-down breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work. After browsing through Yelp, it seemed like Ghini's was the only candidate nearby. Although their door and website state that they opened at 6:30am, they seemed to be running late and didn't open until 6:45am. We had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes. Eventually, our waiter came and, being slightly flustered, took our orders quickly. I was surprised to find that you can't order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe (apparently, they're separate businesses?) For example, you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table, but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter (strange). Anyway, I ordered the Egg Proven√ßal with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast. It really did seem like I had an overcooked order of 6 eggs - just a huge portion off rubbery sadness! (You might be better off ordering the eggs over easy).  The toast was overly buttered as well, which is fine if you like it that way. The only good thing I had was their cafe au lait, which was served in a huge mug. My friend had the breakfast sandwich, and she thought it was decent. With just a few tweaks, Ghini's can be great, but I'm afraid I'd go elsewhere for breakfast or brunch.",

Came here for dinner with a friend using a Groupon that included one starter, two sandwiches/burgers and one dessert. \n\nGuacamole -- you could definitely tell that it was made fresh to order as they claim on the menu, but it was SO bland. There were barely any red onions, cilantro or jalapeno in it, and it looked and tasted like mashed up avocados.\n\nCowboy Burger -- this was pretty good. The brioche bun was toasted nicely and didn't get soggy. The patty was thick and cooked medium, which is what I asked for. Even though it had melted cheese, barbecue sauce, bacon and an onion ring, it didn't feel overly greasy. It came with fries which there were a TON of. I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for dessert. \n\nMile-High Apple Pie -- this is ginormous! It was served warm with vanilla ice cream. Crust was nice. Overall it was yummy. But after a while I got tired of eating all those apples so I think I prefer a regular not-mile-high apple pie. \n\nEven though they have more than just ice cream (ha), that's probably the only thing I'd come back for.",

They were out of Pork Steaks and Hush Puppies as well !  Hard to believe they would be out of food this early in the evening.  We ordered the pulled Pork Plate.  It came out cold!  The pork was room temperature at best.  Fried corn was watery and mealy flavor.  Broccoli was warm, not hot.  Fries and sweet potatoes were hot and tasty.  Overall the meal sucked.  We did get one meal removed from the bill when we finally got to talk with our waitress.  They were very busy so unfortunately we rarely saw our server.",

I ordered an omelette which had a little too much cheese but my sister and mother split the sweet potato pancakes they said they were fluffy, full of flavor and included brown cinnamon sugar syrup. My cousin ordered raspberry pancakes and the sauce tasted fresh. The hash browns are a must. If you are sharing order more than one. My dad enjoyed the cured ham steak! Big plates enough for sharing!",

They are known for their brisket but personally I have found it to be a bit dry and do not care for it -- I would stick with their pulled pork and delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs.  I am a big fan of their sauce more so than other joints, and prefer their mac 'n' cheese over both Edley's and Peg Leg.  If you save room, the Pecan Pie is life-altering.  They also have a good local beer selection and ample parking.  \n\nDespite all the positive reviews, I've yet to try the nachos -- next time!\n\nPro-tip: There is no hostess so drop your name in the bucket when there is a wait!",

Most recently I went on my birthday when my Fiance took me out to lunch, we had their Fritatta and Soup of the Day (It was this potato and corn chowder, kind of spicy which I liked) combo (She had a cup of their Chai also which I tried and found much to my liking).\n\nTheir staff is always at least polite if not outright nice. I'm not all that interested in things that are \"Vegan\" or \"Non-GMO\" or anything of that sort of nature, and while that is largely what they sell I find myself not really caring since the food is good, filling, and reasonably priced. A lot of Mid-Town joints can be fairly pricy, but this is a place you can easily do lunch for two for around $16. The place is kind of hipster-y in my opinion but it doesn't stop me from enjoying myself there.\n\nAs a special note, I love the music they play there. I never imagined I'd get to have lunch on my birthday and hear Third Uncle by Bauhaus come on over the radio. The stars truly do align sometimes!",

We got there at 10AM and left  by 1:30, but I felt like we could have spent so much more time enjoying all the activities. First the hayride- Farmer Doug was so sweet and patient with our group (7 kids 3 & under!) and took time to explain fun facts about the crops and show the girls how to pick corn. The kids were so attentive and excited to see what he would show them next. There was so much to pick and the corn and tomatoes were delicious!\n\nThe play space- we fed the animals and played on the playground. There was lots to do for kids of all sizes. We didn't bring bathing suits so we skipped the splash pad, but I'll be back for that!\n\nThe food- maybe the only thing that would make me give it 4 stars, but I didn't have high expectations for hot dogs and chicken fingers. The cider donuts were a bit of a disappointment. They don't come out hot and fresh, but we're in case waiting. Very apple tasting and large in size, not my favorite and I would skip them next time.",

I guess maybe the flagship location is Manayunk which could be better than Exton. I've been to Exton and Royersford several times and it does not impress me like I hoped it would. I keep going back though hoping things will turn around. I should probably mention I lived in two different cities in China for over 6 months each and have a good understanding of authentic cuisine. The Dan Dan Noodles just do not do it for me. I think people rave about them because no other chinese restaurant around has a dish like this, so maybe it is new to them? The dumplings are good, but totally not authentic at all. And most recently I was here and the menu seemed a bit different. The entree's was just a list of maybe 12 - 16 different 'styles' of food which I thought was a very odd way to present your menu. If you do decide to go, you should definitely try the eggplant.

The Spine Shop is convenient, no appointment needed, reasonably priced  with packaged deals and Vince does good work all around. I enjoy that it's a one man show and I don't have to explain my problem areas ever time. Thanks for keeping me moving Vince!",

I mean, if you do not honor offer codes, why the heck would you waste paper and send me a promotion.  What a complete joke!  Luckily, I listened to my friends who advised me to try the code online.  I was able to book my room for the dates I wanted.\n\nDefinitely an interesting way of conducting business.  They trick you to call in to claim the offer code and if you are requesting two days, they tell you only one day is available for your offer and you have to pay $110 for the other day.  This has happened 3 times already when I call to make a reservation.  I'm not even asking for a weekend day.  What is going on with this place?  Money problems or are you taking your Player card members for granted?\n\nAlso, you should consider replacing your VIP Agents.  It is super disrespectful to call in and have to talk to some snooty person that is rushing you off the phone while the entire time being super annoyed that you called in to bother them in the first place.",

Let's take a look at the fish you ordered Eli, how many of those fish  came off the docks in Lawndale? Wait Lawndale doesn't have docks, but regardless, looks like none to maybe one, so that awesome sushi you're eating in Lawndale, is yes, wait for it..the same freaking fish flown in! You see, they have these things called planes now, what they do is, they load a plane to a glitzy metropolis called Lawndale and another for St Louis. Our plane probably arrives a few hours later, so you do have us there.  Some of the best sushi restaurants are in NYC (I've been to this magical place) and guess what pal, they ain't pulling those fish out of the Hudson River.\n\nTo be fair, I have no basis on Lawndale sushi, because I have never been to Lawndale, let alone hear of Lawndale. I work in Santa Monica some times, perhaps I will avoid those places to try the magical Lawndale Sushi that tastes like you're eating it out of Zeus' butthole.\n\nPerhaps you can bring that cool yellow hat, I am very interested in it as my sister loved Strawberry Shortcake and it seems you shop at the same hat shop as her. I guess it must be a California store.",

First, they have beautifully renovated a building that has been around a while. I could not believe how nice the decor was and the restaurant is super clean. My husband had the pulled pork and I had the ribs. My husband is something of a BBQ connoisseur and he raved about his sandwich. My ribs were smoky and perfect even without sauce, but you should find at least one of their sauce options to your taste. I had the Mac & cheese and smoky green beans. I enjoyed them both and was pleasantly surprised that the green beans were still bright green (told myself I was eating healthy!). As for price, I am a big believer in paying a little extra for quality and food made with care. Circle S certainly not only meets this criteria, but does so incredibly well.",

Even the ice cream was strange.  The vanilla looked it had some chocolate mixed in (and I didn't get the swirl) and it didn't even taste like ice cream.  The salad bar was horrible.  Everything looked dried out and old.  We were there on a Sunday morning right when they opened so I expected a little more from the salad bar.  They had iced tea but it came from a machine and tasted terrible.  No wonder you can get a coupon for $0.99 meal when you buy a $17 game card.  The food was worth about $0.99.  The game room was just what you would expect - loud and obnoxious.  The kids had fun and that's why we went but honestly I would never go back and if I ever do I won't be eating the food.",

Unfortunately the food is underwhelming and poorly cooked. \n\nEach dish we tried had something off about it. \n\nThe Calamari was over-breaded and served with tartar sauce. The tartar sauce must have been inspired by the time Rome invaded Great Britain . I'm pretty sure tartar sauce is not an italian specialty. \n\nThe Burata was flavorful once it warmed up. It was pre-plated and stored in the refrigerator making it too cold until it sat a bit.  The cold also made the croutons unappetizing. \n\nThe Black Spaghetti was oily and had very little lobster. Three small pieces, less than 2oz.\n\nThe Chicken Piccata was bathed in butter,  drowning out any lemon flavor.\n\nThe Polenta fries were too salty to eat. \n\nThe waiter was professional, and was very helpful pointing point out that Mozzarella was a \"cheese\". Oh yes, Gotcha. \n\nPerhaps the main chef left for the night and the sous chef was filling in. It was 1015pm on a Saturday and empty. And no, they were not playing The Cure. \n\nOn an up note, the wine list was great and the service was quick and friendly. \n\nMy suggestion, pass on Moto and try Coco's or City House.",

I had to wait a bit for seating at dinner time, which is a great thing to see them succeeding. \n\nThe service was a tad bit off, but they are new and they were packed, so I will give them a break. I'm sure it will get better with time. More importantly, the staff was very pleasant, the margaritas were delicious as was the food.  The prices were also very fair. \n\nThe only suggestion I would have is their chips are thick corn chips that are obviously out of a bag.  Most Mexican restaurants I go to have either homemade chips or chips that are warm and crispy and at least appear homemade, not the big thick hard ones.",

  "text": "I'm glad that I finally ended my term here. \n\nWhen I first signed up, they made me participate in a \"free training course\" so that I knew how to use the facilities properly. It was a great workout, but turns out it was just a sales pitch for me to sign up for a personal trainer. I was just out of college at the time and obviously did not have money for that sort of thing, but the guy made me feel really bad for choosing to just sign up for a regular membership.\n\nIn the beginning of my membership here, they also had almost an entire room meant for stretching out on mats. Within the past year, they changed it to a weight room and there is barely any room for stretching anymore. If the 3 mats they have are full, you can try stretching on the turf area, but if you are not a Thrive member you are not technically allowed to.\n\nParking here is impossible. If you plan on driving here, don't even think about it. There are about 12 parking spots for well over 300 members that go to his gym. \n\nThere was a lot of turnover among staff in the 2 years I went here, but for the most part they were friendly. Facilities were clean for the most part and the sauna was a nice perk. I was worried about ending my membership here because of all of the horror stories I have read on Yelp, but it was a very simple cancellation process with no fees or hassle.",

I have made it a mission to try the best donuts wherever I travel - this does in fact seem to be the best spot in New Orleans - but they just didn't stack up to what I've had in DC, New York, or Chicago. I do think this place must have really good food outside of the donuts - it smelled very good. The staff was also very friendly.\n\nOne thing that was also a turn off was that they offered a passion and cocoa nib donut - this is a flavor combo that Dough in NYC is famous for. I really hope these people didn't blatantly copy them... seems a little too obvious.",

However, a very large group was using their back private area therefore the available tables in the front room were very deceiving to the expected wait times. Waves and waves of plates were taken to this apparently huge group in the back before we realized what was going on. This of course led to us waiting almost an hour for our two plates. In a properly run establishment the decision should be made to not allow more and more patrons to take a seat and order until a reasonable wait time is to be expected. We would have even been ok with them having given us a warning as we sat that wait times were going to be much longer than expected. Very easy step to take. The servers were clearly overworked due to managements bonehead decision to allow customers to continue to sit. \nEventually our food did come but it wasn't worth an hour wait. We wanted to like this, but bad customer flow management left a bad taste in my mouth.\n \nSuper Easy fix guys! Don't seat people when the wait is going to be that long.",

  "text": "Went to NOLA with my parents and after reading all the good reviews I was excited to try this place.  Made reservations without any problems- which is pretty necessary on weekends I hear.  I like the atmosphere of the place.  It had a nice setting but it wasn't pretentious.  There were all sorts of people there which is always nice. The service was great!  Our waitress was attentive and gave great recommendations.  \n\nNow the food:\nThe fresh oysters were delicious.  I've never had them before and am still on the fence about it overall, but I'll admit they were pretty fresh tasting.  My parents loved it since my mom food orgasm-ed pretty loudly with every bite (pretty gross if you ask me).  I especially like that they had some sort of a wasabi sauce that went with it. \n\nI ordered the etouffee, which was good but it wasn't really anything to write home about.  My mom had the shrimp and grits, which I thought were fantastic but she thought was way too salty.  My dad had the express meal (Sunday was some veal dish with a cup of crab & corn soup).  The soup was really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of the red sauce base and this was kind of in between.  He said he like the veal dish but he will also eat anything and is a man of little to no words - so take that however you want.\n\nOverall, I liked the food and the ambiance of the place.  I was a little disappointed to see that for the price, the portions were tiny.  I know \"nicer\" restaurants always have smaller portions, but still, I guess I like having yummy leftovers.  I think I'd come back here but maybe try some of the other dishes and definitely to try those oysters.",

So to have a meal you really need the medium and large meals.  One of the medium meals I had was just under $8 and the other large was just under $13.  \n\nPersonally at that price for the large, I would rather go to Ciccio Cali and get myself a hot and spicy tuna bowel with spaghetti squash or kale.  The snacks and desserts were okay tasting and I could see if you had a sweet tooth these may be healthier options. \n\nI think if you do not cook at all and don't know how to find held thy meals eating out this may be a good option, every now and again.  But spending almost $900 upfront for $1000 in meals as a member doesn't seem like a good option. \n\nAs someone who cooks, I know I can make similar health meals for 1/4 of the price since fresh groceries from Publix runs me about $60 per week.\n\nBottom Line: Not a good value for the money",

For sides, I had the maque choux mac and cheese - unique with great kick, and the coleslaw - a good option. We redeemed the Yelp check-in special and thoroughly enjoyed the free cheese fries - very cheesy with good texture.

Had the stir fry eggplant special with beef, medium spice. It was ready in less than 10 minutes, comes in a to-go bowl and they wrapped it with industrial strength wrap that did not leak in the car(!), the beef is high quality and very tender, the eggplant is fresh and the sauce is a thai standard with perfect rice. For the quality and the price I'm going back 2x or 3x a week and try everything they have. From a truck!!!",

I must say that the servers were very good and sometimes that can make all the difference.\n\nWe sat outdoors, and while it is nice to have outdoor seating, it is very loud and somewhat stinky because it is close to the busy road.\n\nI would certainly eat here again, and try some other entrees.",

  "text": "This review is for their restaurant week selection. WOW! So good. 4 course meal (plus bread) for $35 each, plus tax and tip. If I had to do it again, I'd choose the Tarte de Legumes, the Saumon, and the Tart Tatin. Also, good-sized portions on everything! Not tiny little fancy portions.\n\nFOOD:\n--Delicious little warm rolls, served with an awesome pesto.\n\n--First course is a \"creamy truffle wild mushroom soup\"...those of us who got it were delighted. It was delicious if not a little weird-looking...Due to allergies, one in our party got a split pea and ham soup and the other a tomato red pepper bisque. Kudos to them for having substitutions (the waiter explained it's their vegetarian option as the mushroom one is no longer vegetarian), and both enjoyed their soups, but I personally didn't really like either of them.\n\n--Appetizer (8 options): We had the Calamars, the Tarte de Legumes, the Tartare, and the Salade Boston. I had the \"sustainably-harvested calamari stuffed with house-made proven√ßal sausage, fresh herbs, saffron rice, piperade, jus de legumes\"...I don't know why but I was expecting your more usual fried calimari, and I'm not a huge fan of fresh seafood, so I didn't particularly care for it. The other two who had it absolutely loved it though. I also tried the \"Tarte de Legumes: roasted eggplant caviar, caramelized onion, and red pepper tart with black olive and goat cheese tapenade, herb sauce, poached Sandy Ridge Farm egg\" and WOW was it delicious. The runny yolk, the tapenade was delicious, and the tart was a little mini cookie-but-not-a-cookie kind of phylo dough thing, a nice accompaniment, as was the bit of greens it was served with. The \"Tartare: fresh Scottish salmon, mango, basil, capers, black olives, cornichons, tomato, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and wonton crisps\" was apparently good, but was being eaten by a tartare conoisseur (6/10 on her scale). She said \"It had bigger chunks of salmon than a standard tartare, which makes it a little fishier tasting.\" The salad (\"Boston bibb lettuce with crumbled gorgonzola cheese, apple, walnut pralines, and walnut vinaigrette\") was well received: a sweet little salad. My only note on the salad is that it's not a real leafy salad. A couple large leafs of lettuce topped with the other stuff. Fancy salad.\n\n--Main course (8 options): We had the lamb (Agneau), steak (Bavette), scallops (Vol au Vent), and salmon (Saumon). The lamb was oh so tender, literally fall-off-the-bone. Even after removing all the fat/skin, there was plenty of meat for a good-sized entree. The mashed potatoes were also awesome. Carrots were fine, but I didn't notice any turnips. My friend had the steak and loved it, although we noted it was rather lukewarm if not on the cold side. She liked her mashed sweet potatoes and the green beans too. I personally, having tried all the dishes, would say this one was the least special, although still good. I think my favorite was the salmon (\"Saumon: pistachio and goat cheese-crusted Scottish salmon filet wrapped in phyllo, carrot pur√©e, creamy Swiss chard, light turmeric and cumin sauce\"), although I can't say I tasted the goat cheese. It was just delicious salmon in delicious buttery phyllo. And finally, the scallops (\"Vol au Vent: butter-poached scallops in puff pastry with creamy Swiss chard and saffron mussel sauce\") were delicious as well. The sauce they pour over it (table-side) is a sauce made with cream and the juice that the scallops and mussels cook in. It was heavenly. The scallops aren't literally in the puff pastry. It's a puff pastry in the middle (my friend wished the pastry hadn't been soaked as it got soggy, so maybe ask your waiter to pour around it), with 4 good-sized scallops around it and lots of different little vegetables (I want to say I stole some okra off her plate but I could be completely wrong) that get drowned in the delicious sauce. Yum.\n\n--Dessert (4 options): We tried all except the profiteroles: the St. Tropez Cake (\"double-layer valhrona chocolate mousse cake with cr√®me anglaise\"), the Tart Tatin (\"warmed French caramelized apple tart a la mode\"), and the Creme Brulee (\"caramelized vanilla bean flan\"). The cake was our least favorite by far. The bottom is like a spongy cake, and is not texturally-appealing, although the mousse part on top is good. Would not order it again. The Tart Tatin was delicious, although they were out of ice cream, so we got fresh whipped cream instead. I also wish it had been served a little warmer than it was (it was room temp), but it was just a simple little apple tart. Not too sweet, just simple. And the creme brulee was well executed.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was awesome. Funny and friendly and knew the menu very well. Asked us if we needed anything at a couple points throughout the meal. Water was always filled. My only complaint is the lady who seated us was cloyingly polite, it was annoying.\n\n---------\n\nGreat little place!",

  "text": "Update: I have eaten the food. Cactus gets another star for that!\n\nFirst off, the fajitas. The servings are HUGE and all the fixins come out sizzlingly hot. My only minor gripe was the way the lettuce, sour cream, etc came out all on one plate. It made putting the fajita together a little tougher if there was something on there you didn't want.\n\nBut the real gem, crazy as it seems, are the firecrackers. See, I love poppers. They're spicy, fried and filled with cheese which basically makes them meet three of my four major food groups (the other being chocolate, of course). But the firecrackers aren't the wimpy frozen things you get at any pizza place in town. Oh no, these are huge singe-your-mouth peppers filled with a wonderfully melty gooey blend of cheeses and fried to crisp perfection. They're messy, certainly unhealthy and burn even my mouth a bit, but they are by far the best cheese-filled pepper concoction I've found.\n\nFirecrackers = worth a whole new star.\n\n(Was tempted to write about the firecrackers without giving an extra star, though, just to reflect the irritation I feel with their frequent and lousy guest bartenders. I don't care how cute she is, if she can't pour my drink and take my money get her the hell out from behind the bar!)",

None of the Jerky is made in-house, instead this is a chain operated by a sole proprietor. It was a great idea for him to open this place bc it attracts tourists like a magnet, but being a local I think my first time shopping there will be my last. Bought the Turkey jerky in Teriyaki and Pepper flavor and I have to say even the bagged Jerky from the grocery store tastes way better. The Sales guy was kind of meh, but I wouldn't say he was rude or aloof, just not overtly friendly.

They're totally in a league of their own! \n\nThe menu is slightly overwhelming, so I defaulted to the original hummus and green salad. The original hummus is soft and nutty just like Zahav/Dizengoff (sorry to pull so many restaurants into this, but I think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality Suraya meets). I blame that on the tehina, Soom Foods. It is served with a pita, fresh from the oven, and it's soft and airy with a subtle crust. The green salad included gem lettuce, raw fennel, watermelon radishes, a soft-boiled egg, yogurt dressing, and pita chips. The flavor profile was satisfying. The meal overall was light, filling, and nourishing! \n\nI went back for seconds the week after. Opted for the baba ganoush, pita, and the rest of the party got the gravlax. Overall, everyone was satisfied. While the ganoush was tasty, I think I'll stick to the hummus. I appreciate that particular spread much more.  \n\nAgain, service and atmosphere were 10/10!",

I missed the opening weekend festivities, but made it the following Monday. \n\nUnderstandably, the store is a bit over staffed, but everyone was awesome! Nice, helpful, communicative without being \"sales-y.\" Alicia helped me put together a cart, which fits perfectly in my laundry room.\n\nKeep it up, Container Store!! Love that you're a hop, skip and a jump away!",

Load up your nachos, burrito or salad without getting taken to the cleaners for every dollop of sour cream or splash of extra salsa.\n\nThis is THE BEST Qdoba location: employees are always friendly and accommodating, food is great quality and the dining room is clean.\n\nQdoba has some new flavors to explore so be sure to check them out.",

  "text": "It can be intimidating when first arriving but don't let that stop you. Coat check and initial entrance are on the first floor. You walk down a corridor to the elevator and ride all the way to the top floor of the building. It's low lighting so pictures might be hard but it's a super trendy and hip atmosphere. More on the lounge side. Lighting is probably to make it seem more intimate. \n\nThe view! Omg, the view of Philadelphia is amazing and totally worth it! \n\nThe food is absolutely fantastic. Very pricey but totally worth it. \n\nI had the spare ribs with roasted carrots and potatoes. My husband had the tuna with a poached egg and a delicious clam sauce. We shared fries dipped first in the mayo sauce and then dipped in house steak sauce. Delicious! We cleaned our entire plates! I'd like to note that the ribs are first braised which makes them tender and slow cooked and then they are grilled. Grilling helps hold the meat together. From a culinary aspect, the texture is easier to cut and hold together on a fork which makes eating much easier. Just braised would be delicious but fall apart which means you'd need a spoon rather than a fork to pick it up. \n\nDessert we ordered the toasted cinnamon crunch. My husband had to have it because of the Krispy Kreme donuts used to make the ice cream. It was accompanied by some crunchy cinnamon brioche bits, toasted hazelnuts, and some sort of cinnamon whipped dollops.  Overall, delicious. Very sweet. \n\nI was disappointed there wasn't a single chocolate dessert option other than a chocolate sorbet. \n\nWe loved every minute, ate every bite! Soooooo delicious. For all that  our bill was just under $90. Again, pricey but worth it since this was our special dinner while visiting Philly. \n\nAttire: men were in suits and jackets. The ladies were in pants, dresses, and heels. You can totally wear jeans as I did but I would recommend classing it up with heels or dress shoes.",

  "text": "I recently moved from Chicago and this place definitely made me feel like I was back in the city dining in a hip new bar/restaurant on West Randolph or Fulton Market.\n\nThe ambiance is dark and romantic, but still full of life and energy.  The tree growing \"through\" the wall was pretty awesome.  The place is pretty small - basically a bar with some tables in front, back, and along the sides. \n\nService was solid, the waitress recommended some good drinks off of their extensive cocktail menu.  I'm not a cocktail pro, but I thought they were delicious and well made.  Our waitress actually recommended many of the \"classic\" cocktails over the ones on the menu.  My advice would be to discuss what you like with the bartenders/servers and let them make appropriate recommendations.  \n\nThe food was good, we had a full dinner here, but I think most people are heading to Libertine for the drinks and atmosphere.  I haven't been to the Ball & Biscuit yet, so I can't compare it to that, but I thought it held its own with many of the well-known Chicago cocktail bars (Whistler, Violet Hour).  A great spot in downtown Indy worth checking out.",

  "text": "I respect the fact that there is a club where the old Dantes is once again dedicated to primarily EDM.  For that alone I got to give it three stars.  That being said they've got some work to do and don't seem to be doing it including adding more beers (just three bud products? come on!!) also they don't seem to open the old art bar  side which was always nice for casual seating.  Like most clubs today it's built to make money off of VIP sections But they really don't provide any security to keep anybody from wandering into your section or grabbing your $200 bottle of vodka.  And another major complaint is only having one bathroom for boys and one for girls.  it's not worth getting VIP tickets because you can just go into a little area that has a miniature bar that's stripped  down with less alcohol.  They do have respectable sound but very  little in the way of lasers and cool lights.  I hope Christian and his staff keep improving and I do have to tip my cap for the talent to DJs they brought in.  It's a tough business to make money but I hope they can make it through and get back to the way Dantes was in its glory days.  Time will tell ...",

  "text": "The newest vessel in St. Elmo's fleet, they had a sign on the sidewalk. It read \"be our guest, put our burgers to the test\", so we did; and we were less than impressed.  Everything was OK, but it was just OK, and I guess I had higher expectations from the offspring of such infamous ancestry.  We started off with the blistered Shishito peppers with sesame ponzu on the side which are an appetizer; but alone there just really isn't much to it.  The peppers actually gave a little flavor to our burgers. Although the burger styles are creative, they just didn't seem to have much flavor.  We had the lamb and the homecoming burger.  Both were ordered medium well and came out what seemed to me more medium rare.  We didn't send it back, which is on us because we were short on time, but I feel it should have been prepared to our order.  The homecoming had the root beer glazed bacon, but it was just two very small half strips that were too small to lend any flavor.  All of us liked the cucumber tomato salad. We truly enjoyed the Bourbon milkshake with the Eagle Reserve poured table side.  Our server was fantastic.  Considering the plethora of burger options in the city and the menu is in St. Elmo fashion, al a carte and pricey, I just think the final impression and the quality fall short for the price tag.",

The new hot item was deep fried peach slices   Otherwise the usual lemonade stands, funnel cakes and Carmel apple spots\n\nThere did seem to be a few less craft venders and they have been moved more west and towards the back.

I visited this place under the recommendation of a fellow Yelper, and I ended up enjoying myself.  The shrimp \"en cocotte\" was well- cooked (with the most perfect McEwan and Sons grits of course).  The husband's jagerschnitzel was tasty but the gravy had an odd taste to it (I noticed ham bits - is that tasso?).  His meal included a soup and a dessert, which was a steal for $23.  The seafood gumbo tasted alright though the rice tasted old and dry. The profiteroles were a nice touch even when we were all stuffed by the end of the meal.  \n\nEuropean with a Cajun flair - not too shabby a place.

Be aware (and this goes for all such companies in the Harbor), that they close by 7pm. You'll have to wrap up your 3 hour tour in time to bring it back. \n\nKayaks and oars were in good condition, and so were we upon our return to the shore.  They offer fishing tours, too, which look awesome. Whale watching, too. Plan ahead, though, because these things book up.",

They say the menu is fusion type with an Asian influence.  I won't say no to Asian fusion....\nI had the Teriyaki kimchi chicken sandwich $10 and the girlfriend had the Goddess salad with Chicken with lemon tahini.  The sandwich was good, the kimchi was mild unlike Korean version.\nThe server said the soup of the day (cabbage & onion) is marvelous so I had a bowl. she added that the soup was vegan. That doesn't matter to me because I'm a carnivore but I will eat anything.  We also ordered a Vegan cupcake with chocolate coconut frosting.  \nAll in all, this place is cool.",

Not everything is to my taste (we will never agree about pre-ripped jeans), but there are always quite a few things to tempt me. The sale rack in the back is typically full of bargains. She carries GREAT and affordable accessories and I love the sunglasses she carries, so much so that I currently am rotating 3 pairs. \n\nLove that she supports other small business owners via trunks shows for various local jewelry, hat, purse makers. And, of course, Toulouse is a great shop ambassador. \n\nHey Yelp - can I give Fairy 17million stars?",

  "text": "My family was out celebrating my sisters birthday and decided to give Michas a try as our company frequently caters from them and it's generally decent then. The inside is very unassuming, pretty humble and low key with some nice art on the walls. \n\nThe salsa here is decent and the food solid. I did really like the carne asada, it was actual steak. Too many Mexican places around town use tasteless, odorless brown beef nuggets. We also ordered a pitcher of margaritas that was pretty run of the mill flavor wise but kinda lacking in the tequila department, tons of mixer in this one. The enchiladas, beans, and rice were all solid Mexican faire but nothing I'd go out of my way for. My favorite item here was definitely the carne asada. \n\nService started out strong but ended up being the downfall of our entire visit. Upon arriving we were seated pretty quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. Service was quick all the way through ordering and getting our food, at which point flagging down our server was nearly impossible. It took us 15 minutes after asking for the check to actually get it. \n\nOnce we gave a card to process payment, we ended up waiting another 15+ minutes at which point I got up to check on progress to see the cashier boy texting away on his phone with our card sitting at the counter. When I got his attention he mentioned he needed an ID to be able to run the card. I asked how we would ever have found that out, to which his response was \"idk I guess we're busy\". They were less than half as busy as when we arrived and service was stellar. For future reference, if you could just acknowledge that the mistake was on your end and not make some lame excuse deflecting responsibility for it, I think I would've walked away feeling a little better about this place. All I've gathered from this is that the staff don't care, which doesn't give me much confidence in this place. \n\nThe food here is solid, acceptable Mexican food. Portion sizes are large enough to satisfy any appetite but in a city full of amazing Mexican food Michas is just not worth the effort. I'll stick to getting my fix of this place when it's catered to my office.",

  "text": "I've been here twice. It's definitely a welcome addition to the Northeast and BYOB is always a plus. The decor is nice and the staff is friendly. My issue is the portion size for the price point. \n\n1 - My first time I ordered the scallops and for $18 you get 4 scallops and about two or three tablespoons of lentils. Nothing else on the plate. I was definitely still very hungry so I sampled what was leftover from appetizers, my friends general tso wings, which were okay. Tasty, but nothing special. The accompaniments to the wings were just blah. I ended up leaving this night very hungry. \n\n2 - I decided there were enough positives to give it one more try. My second visit I ordered the sweet potato gnocci $16 and my friend ordered the duck sandwich. I wish I would have counted, however there may have been 8-12 gnocci on my plate max. It looked like less of a portion than an appetizer. I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I've ordered gnocci and not needed a to-go box. I knew immediately I was still going to be hungry. The flavor, however, was very good.\n\nMy friend was equally unsatisfied with his duck sandwich. It was about  half a sandwich size and did not come with anything on the side. For dinner you would expect a sandwich to have something, anything on the side. I felt bad for him and offered some of my gnocci, which we joked about. We both left still hungry and after paying we decided that we had to hit another spot on the way home in order to get some satisfying food. I know this sounds silly, but we are fit people used to dining in all types of establishments, most often downtown and due to the portion sizes and price point at the Blue Duck we will not be back for a third time. \n\nIf I hear they've made improvements in those two areas I would consider returning because they are on to something with their flavor pairings.",

  "text": "Hip City Veg is on the move.  From its original Rittenhouse Square location, it opened up in University City and now has plans for South Broad Street and Washington D.C.  This is a successful fast food vegan establishment, yet it is not my favorite,  In an increasingly crowded market of health fast-food dining options in Philadelphia, Hip City Veg does some things well and other things not so well.  I do like their Udon noodle salad but in my mind there is much too much arugula and too little of the other tasty ingredients be they peanuts, chicken substitute, daikon, scallions or even udon itself. for the price. It would more accurately be named an arugula salad.  There are absolutely no condiments out for people to use.  Aww c'mon guys!  I did ask and received a little Sriracha sauce to spice it up a bit.  The sweet potato fries are good but again the portion is small in relation to the price in my opinion. There is free water which is nice to have.  At the University City location the staff are friendly and it's kept clean.",

Since we were only drinking, not eating, we made sure to tell the hostess that, because their bar area was full. She sat us at a dining table anyway, even after we asked if she was sure it was okay. We didn't want to inconvenience them, but it was 3pm and there was no evident mealtime rush. She assured us it was fine.\n\nClearly, NOT fine. It takes a lot to make me feel guilty for drinking (sorry for partying), but I immediately felt the disapproval from our server. When we had to tell him that we were just drinking (couldn't the hostess have told him that?), there was some major attitude. When he brought us our first round of drinks, he asked if this would be the only round. It just seemed rush, weird, and full of 'tude. I imagine they aren't hurting for business since they have a prime location for hungry tourists that don't feel like looking any further, but that's also probably the same reason they can get away with being a little rude. \n\nIf it wasn't for the supreme politeness and friendliness from other New Orleans restaurants, then maybe my standards wouldn't be so high, but Mr. B's fell short of the outstanding customer service we experienced at virtually every other establishment, yes, even the to-go daiquiri shops.",

Felt as if we were in the Carribean-\n\n Mary is the wonderful hostess who will make you feel at home and serve you drinks while you wait for menus - she HIGHLY recommended the mimosa flights - so good! It's 4 different mimosas flavored with 4 different juices-\nThey also have beer flights -\nPerfect for brunch! The Tex mex Migas were to die for- I didn't expect so much out if eggs but the tortillas and green and red bell peppers and onions made the dish. Get them with chorizo !!! They also offer many types of hot sauce - \nThe Cuban sandwich was perfect- \n\nI told them\nI had to catch a plane and they cooked  my brunch FAST to make sure I got to eat.. That was priceless.

  "text": "We went here with another couple for dinner. It is a nice addition to the neighborhood. The food was traditional pub fare. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. My friend had a salad with ahi tuna. The tuna was sliced very thick for a salad portion but otherwise was good. I had fish tacos. They were tasty but the fish was a little dry. My husband had a cubano sandwich that he loved. Our other friend ordered a salad which he said was very good. He ordered his dressing on the side. He asked for a little more dressing as it only came with one small cup. The waitress immediately brought another cup over. At the end of the evening we noticed we were charged .69 cents for the additional dressing. This was surprising and disappointing. Overall it was a favorable experience but the restaurant has a few kinks to iron out and should not charge for a little extra dressing for a salad.",

The place is huge! \n\nFood - 2 stars unfortunately.   Three of the three plates arrived with cold food.   The chicken in two of the plates seemed to be reheated frozen chicken.   The chicken strips were very uniform in cut and color to be fresh it seemed..... and were cold.   It surprises me that QDoba, Baja Fresh,  and Chipotle can serve fresh hot chicken as fast food restaurants but Crooked struggled.   I do realize the kitchen is still young and working out the kinks,  but delivering cold bland chicken should be fixed within the first few days of opening. \nThe French Fries get 4 stars.   They are very tasty and crispy.   They arrived warm.\nI recommend The Barrelhouse for a great place for beer but have not been sold on the food part. We well definitely be back with hopes of improvements from the kitchen.",

I have tried other Indian food from this place and they do not compare. The only negative comment I have is that their customer service is not the best and is inconsistent at times.

  "text": "The Cunningham Restaurant Group has taken the Indy food scene by storm, and they never fail to please. Due to the diversity of offerings, comparing one of their restaurants to another is a welcomed impossibility.  Livery, the newest addition to the company's line of exquisite eateries, is certainly their most unique.  \n\nHoused in the old Indianapolis Police Department Horse Livery, the Cunningham Restaurant Group puts a modern and hip twist on a historic building.  Livery is a gorgeous restaurant.  While certainly an establishment of class, it fails at being pretentious.  The atmosphere is relaxed, and with its two-levels of dining space and beautiful patio, the diner will never be uncomfortable.  Even if one is forced to wait for a table, which, with the Livery's popularity, is certainly a possibility, pausing at one of the restaurant's two bars is sure to bolster the appetite.\n\nThe toughest decision one will make at Livery is what to order.  The Latin American-inspired menu caters to solo and group diners alike.  With many small plate options, no one is forced - or even tempted to choose just one item.  That wouldn't be any fun.  I suggest going big, going all-out, and having a damn good time doing it.  I started with the yuca fries, the chorizo empanada, street corn, ribs & jicama, and ceviche.  Clearly, I did not eat all of this by myself - but I was tempted.  The yuca fries, coupled with Chihuahua cheese, were absolutely delectable.  Don't dine at Livery without getting an order.  The chorizo empanada, hearty and piping hot, nearly made me lose my inhibitions (i.e. not share them). The ribs and jicama were quite tender - and how 'bout that barbecue sauce? Mmm..mmm..mmm.  They were so good that once the plate was passed to me, I only got to eat one-half of a rib; it's all Livery's fault.\n\nMy second course included the the chile relleno and the pork pastor.  The chile relleno, like everything else, was terrific.  The Chihuahua cheese, as with the yuca fries, really tied the dish together.  The couscous innards put a special North African twist on a popular Mexican dish. The pork pastor was truly magnificent. The piquant blend of flavors from the pork, pineapple, onion, and cabbage makes this the most interesting item on the menu. Next time, I'm getting an order all to myself.\n\nI always save the best for last: dessert.  There is absolutely no reason to ever skip it, especially when dining at Livery.  The churros.  The churros.  The churros...fried, sweet, and as delicious as \"delicious\" can get.  I am guilty of licking the plate clean.  Since the kitchen and bar stay open late, Livery is a wonderful spot for dessert and after-dinner drinks.\n\nAs with any other restaurant in the Cunningham Restaurant Group's portfolio, the service at Livery is superior.  Our particular server was personable, well-versed on the menu, and speedy.  Given how busy he was with other guests, I felt his efforts were worthy of note.\n\nLivery is a five-star experience.  It is a restaurant that does not have to put on airs to impress its guests, and I highly recommend it.",

I had a wonderful home birth, but was in need of a breast pump to help get the contractions going Sunday evening. It was almost impossible to find a breast pump at that time.  Despite the owner being on the verge of giving birth herself, and despite it being late Sunday evening, she responded to our voicemail quickly and helped get us the pump we needed! It was crucial to allowing my birth to go as smoothly as it did! Since then, I have taken a Mama's Connect group, a baby CPR class, Mama-Baby Yoga and will be signing up for the Baby Sign Language workshop. I have made so many friends and connected with so many other Mamas in the area.  I have only lived i the bay area for about two years, and have absolutely no family nearby. The community I have made through Then Comes Baby is so important to me.  It is a beautiful, warm, and welcoming space, conveniently located and I would recommend it to all families.",

  "text": "Update: Black Palm unfortunately went out of business in early September.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlack Palm is an elegant, comfortable restaurant that serves excellent food. Wife and I have been to this spot three times now, and each time have found the food to be inventive and delicious.\n\nAtmosphere - the owners have redone the interior in aquas and dark woods, with a rich, elegant feel. It compliments the original arabesque interior really well. The restaurant is nicely lit for a date, and the tables are decently spaced. We've seen a few kids here, but it is really geared for a more adult experience. \n\nFood - many dishes are Spanish inspired (such as paella etc) but the requisite steaks, scallops etc are also on the menu. Everything we've had has been tasty. Salads are not skimpy, and the apps, which can be hit or miss at many places have for us been unique and showed a lot of thought. The arapas royale in particular are freaking delicious. Last night wife loved the corvina, and in the past the chicken in banana leaves have been great.\n\nBonus - the restaurant is basically situated in a little park on the bay, and strolling out on the lovely dock after dinner was a perfect way to extend our evening. \n\nIn short, this is one of our favorites in the area. In a sea of mediocrity, this restaurant is an inventive standout with a great atmosphere in a lovely setting.",

  "text": "Thanks Carleen for the wonderful appointment! My mini vacay to Reno is not complete without a visit to Carleen. I don't cut my hair often and usually wait til I have Rapunzel length hair when I see her. Booking an appointment with her is easy but beware..she is normally booked out months in advance and I consider myself lucky if I can score a last minute opening with her (she updates her Facebook often with these openings).\n\nHer studio is super easy to get to (very close to GSR). She always asks in advance your hair inspiration and will talk you through it before she works her magic. She makes you feel at home..drinks, snacks, free wifi, coloring books (for adults), beauty bar and much more.\n\nAnother thing I awesomely appreciate is that..I am not a very social talker and she and her staff make it super comfortable for me here.",

The coffee is good (middle of the pack in this neighbourhood) and the food smells great, but I guess I don't thing of it as a restaurant and generally I'm not there at meal times.\n\nOur typical time at Remedy is spent talking over a coffee, beer or chai.  It's got a more relaxed atmosphere than the nearby Sugar Bowl and I'd say a more Bohemian vibe than the hipster scene across the street.  It's more conducive to visiting and conversation in the evenings.\n\nThis end of 109 is getting to be quite the evening spot.  There are a couple of sushi spots, a couple of diners, a couple of espresso cafes, a really decent pho place, and with Sugar Bowl and Remedy you can stretch the evening out with drinks and coffee (along with Indian food) before popping into the Garneau for some Art House.",

Rooms are ok they have natural marble floors in the bath rooms. Actual real HDTV on all channels. Free bottles of water in room, by the pool and by the street doors. This hotel is very high load so forget about early check in. We were told it is always 86 percent full and often 100 percent. There is always some kind of event going on with mass loads of business people. We saw some people still waiting for rooms after 4 pm. Beds are decent as are the pillows. Sheets could be a little nicer. The room cleaning is fair at best and they are very slow to clean the rooms due to high occupancy.  It has real central air conditioning. Ask for a room not directly above the Hilton Executive lounge. The Buffett breakfast is pretty decent. The pool is weak and a big downer. The pool is cold, not heated and very boring. We heard many people and kids complain and we went on sunny days in late July. No bar service at the pool. No bar near the pool. No hot tubs anywhere on the property. No indoor pools. There is a Hard Rock Cafe and Landry's Seafood right on the property. Decent location to many St. Louis attractions. Friendly front desk staff.",

  "text": "Bacchanal is the best spot in New Orleans for an afternoon (happy hour where glasses of wine are $5 and $1 off beer) or the evening. Everyone comes here, travelers and people of all ages. You enter a dark, small space with tons of wine, a fridge with beer and a fridge with cheese that you select and they make a board for you. They also manage to have a menu of amazing food.\n\nI came twice in one day. I stopped by at 4pm and found a seat outdoors, listening to some lazy blues live. I tried their shaved brussel sprouts salad with pickled onions, feta, and apple slices. It was perfect and crisp for the hot New Orleans day. I went back, got a second glass of a good pour of red, and their bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo. PERFECTION.\n\nI took a nap and came back with a friend. By then, there was a line out the door but no wait. We just had to show our ID. We grabbed a bottle of wine ($17 for a South American merlot) and went outside. There was no seating so we headed upstairs and were able to watch the people from above. There's also a full bar indoors upstairs. It's fancier in there. They still served food late, which I needed after I drank a whole bottle of wine by myself!\n\nYou will definitely talk to someone here and have interesting conversations so it's a great place to go solo or with friends.",

Beautiful decor and happened to run into a few people I knew who happened to be dining at the same time, so I know it was a hot spot. I also had heard nothing but great things about the place, so I knew we were in for a treat. \n\nI ordered the skillet de la casa, made with chorizo, biscuits and gravy, cheese and over easy eggs. Also came with a side of potatoes. Everything was delicious... I almost wished it was a larger serving because I ate everything. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo omelette and enjoyed that as well. I was in the mood for a mojito, only to find out it was the best mojito I had ever had since Tao in Vegas. I'll definitely be back for more of those! \n\nGreat first impression.

Staff has always been friendly and service has always been quick. I've only had one problem here which was about a year ago and someone in the group I was with found a hair in their food. Both the waitress and the manager handled the situation. They were extremely apologetic, comped his meal, offered to bring him a new one, plus gave him a coupon for a free meal on his next visit. While finding a hair in your food is bad, it's still not as bad as finding sharp blade in your bread, which I did at another restaurant, and unfortunately, didn't find it until it entered my mouth! But that's for another story! So while it's unfortunate that these things do happen on occasion, at least it was handled well. My coworkers and I will continue to stop in here from time to time. The only other downside really is the location. Parking and getting in/out of the Gateway Shopping Center can be a real bear sometimes!",

Seriously, try the lengua... it is incredibly juicy and tender. The thick, homemade, chewy corn tortillas are really the perfect vessel for all that flavor. \n\nThe horchata is also oh-so-refreshing --especially on a hot summer day in Tucson.\n\nMy least favorite was the fish taco. For me, the amount of mayo kinda ruined it for me. But you should definitely try it for yourself because many others rave about it and I'm just not too crazy about fish tacos in general.

We got in late Thursday night starving and found that the perfect spot was the lobby bar. We were starving so we ordered the wings, cheese fries, a burger and some drinks. All of these were amazing. Better yet they had a live band which was amazing. After we ate we headed up to the room taking in all the cool elements. From the lobby decorations to the old school movies in the elevators to the cool lighting in the hallways. The staff was extremely friendly and offered me an umbrella when it was raining. My only complaint was I asked for the room to be cleaned the second day around 11 after the maid came at 9 am and I was still in bed. Front desk assured me they would send someone right up. I come back 5 hours later after touring all day exhausted and the room is still a mess. I decided to go with it. Fast forward next day no maid at the door so I ask again and 6 hours later no such luck. I call again and they send someone an hour later. At this time I needed to get ready for a wedding and needed the room. So yes the hotel is lovely but the maid service could use some better communication.",

As a tried and true member of the 'sit on the couch and watch movies' crowd, Rocks and Ropes has been a fun and interesting place to trick myself into a 'workout'. \n\nI love that each time I come there's a mix of new and old routes. It's great being able to really see my progress (finally got up a 7+!) as well as have something new to try out.  They rate their climbs on a tally system where everyone who climbs a new route can rate it, which is great, but leads to a bit of variation between similarly rated routes. It still makes for a great workout though and you can push yourself to try something a little more difficult each time. \n\nAfter coming here a couple times, my boyfriend and I sprung for the punchcard deal where you get 10 anytime entries + rental. They also have monthly memberships with discounted student, military and family/couple rates as well as a 2-for-1 beginner package for 30 dollars which includes rental and an intro class to climbing for two people.",

He is a very nice asset to his hotel.  We will most likely stay here again.  QVC headquarters is only 4mi away; a fun time :).

Great food, good prices, nice atmosphere. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was lightly breaded and seasoned, very good.  My husband ordered the blackened tuna and shrimp entree and loved it. I ordered the Captain's platter and it was super tasty. Our waiter was very personable. We would eat here again.",

  "text": "I'm an infrequent guest to The Waterfall but made an apperance today because my friend and I were in the mood for hookah. Sundays are advertised as half off the normal hookah price of $15. So naturally I assume it's $7.50, only to be informed that the price was in fact $9. I ask the bartender about it and he says, no it's $9. I inform him that is not half off then. He just shrugged it off and said, \"Well thats what we charge.\" I realize it's only a buck fifty but I feel like that is false advertisement. A trick to get you into their ghost town of a bar. I've had some good times there but will definitely not return since they feel they can take advantage of their patrons like that.",

  "text": "In many ways, I'm a creature of habit, and when it comes to dining in Mid City, my \"habits\" are Mandina's and Liuzza's.  I'd been saying for ages that I'd go to @katiesmidcity, and never got past Bienville Street.  I finally did, and I'm a changed person.\n\nKatie's is a classic NOLA neighborhood place; the decor and menu reflect this, right down to the \"Bring the Wood!\" bat (from the Saints' Super Bowl season) hanging up behind the bar.  They've got Abita Amber on tap, cementing my relationship with the place solidly.\n\nMy first trip to Katie's was lunch with a friend.  She grazed on the Grilled Chicken Salad while I had the \"Terranova\" pizza.  More on the pizza later.  It was good, friend was very happy with the salad, and the first visit was a win!  A week or two later, I decided to come back for lunch, and sat at the bar.  I ordered the mushroom-swiss burger with grilled onions.  As you can see, it was a winner, a solid half-pound patty, a good bun, and fresh toppings.  Gotta love the Saints paper lining the basket!  Even though Katie's does a most-excellent burger, that may be the last one I get.  The reason is simple: there are other places that do a good burger and Katie's does so many other things so well.  \n\nThird trip to Katie's was with family for dinner.  They were skeptical-you think I'm bad about Liuzza's?  You should hear my boys.  We started with basic cheese fries (no debris gravy).  The boys both had the hickory burger (hickory sauce, swiss cheese, bacon).  Wife had a shrimp po-boy and I got the fried green tomato and shrimp sandwich.  The boys killed the burgers and wife's sandwich disappeared almost as fast.  I found my sandwich a bit dry, not enough remoulade sauce.  I tweeted as much, and not five minutes later, Chef Scott came by the table to see what was wrong.  I've never seen such a fast reaction in my life!  I was extremely flattered when he offered to bring me some more remoulade sauce (which is one of the best in town, to be sure).  Alas, I had eaten all of the po-boy already.  It wasn't bad, mind you, I just thought it could use more sauce to balance the french bread.  As an appetizer (sans bread), it would've been just right.  The combination of the flavors is fantastic.  If you get this sandwich, though, be sure to ask them for extra remoulade sauce.\n\nMy most recent visit to Katie's was last week, another business lunch.  My colleague had the chicken quesadilla, and I got another Terranova pizza, since the photo of the first one didn't come out well at all.  I'm glad this one did, so not only can I include it in this post, but because I'll be writing a second one where I proclaim this pizza the Best in New Orleans.  Just look at it-wonderful!  Chef Scott did point out that, to make this one hit home with me (I'd been spotted coming in), he brushed the crust with his olive-oil/garlic sauce before putting the marinara on.  (He said anybody can ask for that, btw.)  Even without that extra touch, however, this is a wonderful pizza.  Others I know swear by the Yardbird (chicken, onions, tomato, feta, with the olive oil/garlic sauce), but I refer sausage pizzas when I know it's good sausage.  The Terranova gets its name from Terranova's Supermarket over in Faubourg St. John, and their most wonderful Italian sausage.  \n\nChef Scott also treated us to a wonderful cheesecake for dessert, but alas, my batteries died before I could get a picture.  We'll give dessert a better treatment on the next trip.\n\nKatie's is more than just a solid neighborhood place.  There's some tasty and creative food here.  We go to a neighborhood restaurant for comfort food, or to have a beer with friends.  Katie's is a destination for more than just those things--it's a place for a truly enjoyable dining experience.",

They are so consistent with their food and the quality of everything they use is top notch. From time to time I try a new place just because I live in Metairie and don't want to make the drive uptown but I'm always disappointed that I took the easy way out. All of their dishes have different flavors because the sauces are all made differently. So many Chinese restaurants use the same sauces on different meats or shapes of chicken and give them different names but yet they taste exactly the same. Not August Moon because they prepare and  take pride in the preparation and taste of each and every dish they serve. No more easy way out for this Metairie girl!!",

I have a feeling that the hard seating surfaces are easier to keep clean or something, which is important, but sheesh.  That said, the interior (right down to the hard seating) is freaking awesome.  Look at those high-chairs made out of pipe and wood.  Neat prohibition theme!\n\nNice selection of beers, and I'd never heard of mules before, but they have 'em and they're tasty!\n\nHad the Wiseguy Fries as an appetizer.  Fries, nacho cheese, BBQ pulled pork (if I remember right), sour creme, and some green onion.  Served in a great big bucket.  Yummy.\n\nI had the bucket burger with the chipotle sauce.  Amazing!  Came with fries... now these are the same fries used in the awesome appetizer, right?  Now I'm a bit of a fry nazi... I want mine more... turgid.  These were... flaccid.  Tasted good, though.  Just not my thing.\n\nWe also got a chicken wrap that looked good.  I didn't try it, but it came with chips and salsa.  The salsa is better than the salsa at the Mexican place down the street, and also had a bit of kick.  I expected something more bland from a brewhouse, I guess.  Nice job!\n\nWill totally eat here whenever I want a beer and some yummy stuff to go with  it!",

We flew into Nashville and there is a shuttle but it's $30 per person round trip. taxi's are $25 plus $1 for each additional person. We found another  person going to the hotel that shared the cab so it was about $10 per person after tip.\n\nCheck in. We over 3000 people attending check in was hectic but the hotel had several people handling the check in and it went about was well as one could expect.\n\nThe rooms. spacious and comfortable. Our room overlooked the atrium and had a small balcony with a small table and 2 chairs. I would definitely recommend a room on the atrium side. Nice big screen tv, fridge, and microwave. Free internet which I am using as I write this. A little slow for a small fee you can get faster internet.\n\nFood. Very good, especially when we had lunch buffets. Restaurants are good but rather pricey. \n\nFacilities. Plenty of room for our large group. the only hiccup was there were some internet problems during some of the presentations but that could have been operator error.\n\nStaff.

  "text": "Ok, I will keep it short about me.  I am a very experienced southwest food aficionado.  My time in California and Colorado as well as many seasons of making green chili from Hatch chilis has spoiled me. \nNow to what counts. Having changed job locations, I looked to Yelp for dining suggestions.  I found this gem and after reading its reviews decided to take my cohorts with me for a trial run.  We were delighted.  I could eat here daily and be happy as can be.   Unfortunately my friends like other styles of food as well so it is still a treat for me.  \nI'm a burrito guy.  I know burritos.  These are the bomb.  Huge portions.  Great flavors.  Amazing.  Do yourself a favor and get a meat lovers.  I like extremely spicy food and they have a red sauce that delivers.  I get mine with that sauce inside.  Usually the sauces are on the side.  \nTalk about friendly, these people are wonderful and willing to work with you on your requests. \nParking sucks, but there is a vacant lot for overflow parking just to the west so it's manageable.  \nGet there early because the cats out of the bag and they fill up fast towards noon.  \nCheers",

When the server came back to check five minutes later, she asked if it was \"microwave cold or completely cold\". From that I surmise that it's pulled from a freezer & heated in a microwave. \n\nI ate some of my husband's hash browns.

  "text": "My family and I (there was 8 of us) ordered about 8 things & we sat at three tables that were next to each other & just kept passing the desserts around to taste each thing. \n\nThe place was super cute, but the desserts were disappointing & expensive. Plus the place was packed. \n\nGood:\nThe strawberry cheesecake, chocolate peanut butter pie, and chocolate peanut butter brownie were good, but for the price.... moving on.\n\nNot so good:\nThe Carmel cake looks so nice, but it was real dry and just not that good. The berry bread pudding was huge, like it was just this big square of sponginess. The bread pudding was too wet and it tasted kind of funny so I'm thinking it was just the berries in it- I'm not so use to berry bread pudding. The Marie Antoinette wasn't good at all, but I will say that I've never had one before, so it could be just because I don't like that particular dessert overall. \n\n\nGreat:\nThe cookie and cookie Ice box cake were sooo delicious, still pricy, but they were the bomb. The cream on the ice box cake was sweet and went so well with the thick chewy ( not too chewy) cookie. It was about the only thing I ate.\n\nToo expensive, some stuff is good, other stuff isn't good, and it's gorgeous inside.",

It's a neat restaurant with cool atmosphere and very friendly service, but I feel like it's overrated. While they claim they have a large draft beer selection (and they do), not one beer is recognizable. The menu wasn't much better -- the $11+ burger selection is pretty out there and they don't come with any sides, those are ordered separately. After eating we all said it was nothing outstanding and we agreed the fries were the best part of the entire meal... And they were just fries, nothing special themselves. The experience wasn't entirely regretful, but we will not be back.",

I got all of those when I recently stayed here.\n\nThe room was clean.  It served my needs which were to sleep at night and to shower in the morning.  Nothing more was needed for me.  The few times I did need something or had a question to ask, the front desk and/or concierge were both able to assist quickly.  The only nit I have to pick is that I really wanted a late checkout, but they did not tell me until the final day that \"late check out\" is noon, only 1 hour later.  However, you can check your luggage there and pick it up later if needed.\n\nOverall, it's a great location for those who want to stay in the French Quarter, as well as explore the Warehouse District.",

  "text": "No Yelp Elite member reviews yet? Hmm, okay, let me take a stab at it. \n\nI had bought a Groupon for Dawna Ara and it was soon to expire. So I tried calling but I didn't get a response. In the voicemail, she prompted to book via the website. You check the website and the only date that was available was the day after the Groupon's expiration date.\n\nHmm...Plan B.\n\nDecides to email her directly and email Groupon just in case I can't use it. Groupon responsed and said they would give me credit in Groupon money if I never used the deal. Dawna also responded and after exchanging a few emails, we had settled on a date.  So if you have problem getting through her, I would say email is the way to go.\n\nThe date arrived and finding this place wasn't too difficult via GPS. However, it's a residential building and does not have any company name posted. Look for the house with the little white fence.  I walked in and just saw candles lit and chairs with literature on the table. I also saw an Iphone but I figured that was hers. I was finally greeted by Dawna after what looks like the owner of the building came in and shut the door. \n\nDawna does everything herself. So there's a bit of a wait before, during, and after the session. This was my first time at acupuncture and I actually did feel something working immediately after I finished the treatment. I came in for multiple ailments but she concentrated on the main aspect of my problem. BTW, the treatment was relaxing since I was lying down for 30 minutes but the actual treatment was a little bit shorter than I expected compare to the other reviewers. Also the massage was a bit shorter than I expected. Nevertheless, this place should be tranquil enough after she updates it with some furnishings since it is really bare at the moment. Thus, not bad for the Groupon rate. Note to add, if you ever check out the bathroom, it feels a bit slanted.",

Besides, this was down from Waffle House , which was packed and we didn't feel like waiting. \n\nThe exterior clearly states they do Breakfast, lunch and dinner. They building itself doesn't lend itself to say it's a restaurant. If your turning in right off David dr, you will not make the turn into the main parking lot if there are cars parked right there. You will have to back up and turn in more to make it in. It was a weird setup especially if your driving a truck. Once you park, the only door on that side is not the entrance, you have to walk back around to the side you drove I. On and enter there. Another weird setup. \n\nUpon entering, you will see everything is just 1 big open room. They do not seat you. You seat yourself, grab a menu and place your order with the cashier. You pay first. I don't tip before my meal is served so I opt to leave a tip after I'm done eating. \n\nThere is a drink station for getting your once soft drinks and coffee.  The food is delivered to your table by servers.\n\nOverall, the food was better than I expected it would be. I could do without the fried frozen home fries. I'm more of a grilled in the pan potatoes.  I got the French toast breakfast with 2 eggs and home fries. The French toast was only 1 piece of bread cut in half. I was surprised with that. I thought it would be a standard 2. They were out of regular syrup so had to use sugar-free syrup. \n\nIf you drink coffee with Splenda. They do not carry it. \n\nPrices were reasonable and we plan on returning to try out dinner.",

It has both new and used vinyl, CD's, and DVD's. The back of the store is where the fun begins and where the serious music collector will want to go. The back is stocked full of thousands (10's of thousands) of vinyl LP's, 12'' and 7'' singles at great bargain prices. I spent about 8 hours there and only got through a fraction of the stock. The back is organized by format and basic genre with average prices ranging from $.50 to $3 per record. They have listening stations for both vinyl and CD so you can test out any new weird things you find. I ended up finding so much stuff that I had to ship it home (too many records too fit in my luggage). Overall, this is a great shop that is well worth the drive if you're in the state of Florida. Great selection of music with a super friendly (and honest) staff. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Florida!",

  "text": "Coco's Cocina is right across the street from the Broadway Theatre of Pitman and next to Sweet Lula's, a nice, traditional Italian restaurant owned by the same couple. But you really don't need these directions. You'll easily find Coco's while driving down the street. You can't miss the glamorous, flashy, bright red signage. It's right in the heart of town.\n\nWalk in to find a BYO, seat-yourself establishment and offers a seriously affordable menu. Chips and salsa, or guac, or queso, run about $4. All entrees (regular or wet burritos, tacos any style,  quesadillas, etc., with preferred protein/veg) are $9 and come with rice and your choice of pinto or refried beans. Keep in mind it IS \"Tex-Mex\" in that nothing is overly spicy; therefore, it is a good eatery for folks who don't mix it up much with their diets or want a \"tame\" meal. You can add hot sauce, however.\n\nThe vibe inside is very relaxed with a good number of tables and a food truck mural with a window that peeks into the kitchen. A jingle rings each time food is sitting and ready to be served. Mexican sodas, regular fountain pours, and virgin margaritas are available as drink options.\n\nSo originally here (before writing all that basic info), I included the long story of the visit with my mom from earlier this week. But it bored me so I deleted it. Basically the experience culminated with owner/chef/puppeteer/entertainer Anthony Asbury sitting at our table coaxing her to eat churros for the first time. It was hilarious but probably one of those \"you had to be there\" moments. But I will say that both owners are super friendly/funny/accommodating, and those qualities clearly align with their effective business operations.\n\nMy mom and I split the chips and queso app to start. Both the chips and the dip were delicious. No kick. If you want queso with a kick, go down the street to the other Mexican spot in town.\n\nFor my meal, I had the chicken tinga quesadilla. Again, no kick, nothing fancy, but just good, gooey toasted tortilla with chicken. The addition of sour cream with lettuce on the side was nice. I also really enjoyed my rice and would probably ask to get two sides of it instead of the beans in the future.\n\nMy mom had the pork carnitas tacos. The entree comes with three, and you get your choice of shell. She went with crispy, and liked them. As mentioned, she also had the churros (with Jack Daniel's bourbon butterscotch sauce) and ate them all rather quickly despite complaints of them being \"too hot.\" I had a bite and would definitely save more room for them in the future.\n\nI really enjoyed my first visit to this new spot in Pitman. It's good for any occasion and will likely hold a spot in my take-out rotation.",

The cocktail/beer menu was impressive, I am a sucker for a crafted cocktail!  I had the pasta carbonara and it was very good, probably a little too filling before a night of drinking on the town, but entirely worth it!  Our server was amazing.  After dinner our limo broke down so one of the manager/owners drove us to the bars himself, talk about incredible service! It was a bit pricey I definitely wouldn't be able to eat there often but it is great for a special occasion.  If I didn't live so far I would be going weekly for ladies night I hear they have some great deals!",

How often can you say that about any sort of auto service?  I received a call from Tim at 10:30 letting me know the tires were in and we scheduled a same day appointment for 3 pm.  No waiting for days on end!  The car was taken in shortly after my arrival and all four tires were mounted and balanced in about 30 minutes.  While waiting I observed 30 minutes worth of highly professional and friendly service, then had the pleasure of chatting with Tim for a few minutes.  Great price on the installation ($20 per tire) with absolutely no hidden charges or unnecessary work pushed on me.  Though this car does need an inspection and the plan is to take it back to Havertown T&S after this experience.",

I had terrible allergies or a cold when I woke up in the morning and on a lark, I searched for Chinese foot massage hoping to stimulate my immune system. Turns out this place is right down the street from my parents house so I decided to go on the off chance they could take me a s a walk in. They did! Super clean, quiet, and very similar to what I get in Oakland chinatown near where I live. The massage started off very light so I asked them to massage harder. I want to feel the pain in the areas I need help but I suspect the local clientele doesn't like that...hence the kid glove touch. But once I asked for more pressure, I got it.  Thank you so much for the great massage. Really wish I could get SF/Bay Area prices here but $35 for an hour still ain't that bad. I'll be back at xmas!",

  "text": "Came here early on a Friday night; it was not too crowded.  If you sit inside, the tables are communal so you may be tight on elbow room.  There are also counters.  We ordered the melanzana pizza and the italian caesar salad. The pizza was soggy. When you lifted a slice off by the crust (as you normally would when eating pizza) all the toppings slide off.  It was disappointing.  The flavors were good; but the sogginess of the pie made me wonder how come this place has gotten such rave reviews.  I looked around and the other diners appeared to have non-soggy pizza.  They were actually holding the crust and biting into the pizza, whereas we were scooping our toppings off the plate.  So perhaps it is just this style of pizza that needs help.  I don't know.  I suspect that the pizza was made beforehand; dough rolled out too thin.  The soggy part of the pizza was also cold.  I'm definitely not coming back and actually would have given this place 1 star, but the waiter was nice and when we mentioned they could improve their soggy pizza they offered us a complimentary soft serve.  That was delicious, but not enough to change my mind about coming back for the pizza.  Also, there were egg shells in our salad.  So overall I question the quality of the food here.",

You have to be operating a restaurant exceptionally to stay in business that long. \n\nThe hospitality, ambiance, and food are excellent. Definitely one of the finer Italian restaurants in the Delaware Valley. You can't get a bad meal here. The waiters are old school, with a slight attitude, but in a nice South Philly way - it's all part of the experience. The sauces are as good as it gets - done right...very authentic.\n\nVery nice bar scene too w/ piano player.",

  "text": "As a college student, this is probably as good as it gets.  FYI, this review only applies on Tuesdays, when it's all you can eat tacos for about $8.  That's incredible!\n\nThe chicken tacos are a little messy, but they are honestly divine for a taco that you can eat as much as want.  The beef tacos are pretty good too, but trust me, try the chicken tacos if you ever get all you can eat.\n\nNow, I can understand the less generous reviews about this place if you aren't going for all you can taco Tuesdays.  The food is ok, nothing spectacular but is a little bit on the pricey side.  Sometimes the waiters/waitresses are really good, courteous, polite and friendly, but other times they're the complete opposite.\n\nAnyways, if you're a college student looking to eat a lot for a little, or you can just eat a lot, or even if you just like tacos a lot, I'd definitely recommend coming here on Tuesdays and getting their all you can eat tacos.  If you're looking for gourmet Mexican cuisine, then I suggest looking elsewhere.",

Of course, 5 comes and goes and by this time it has been 3 days of no coffee or water for a law office of about 15 employees. I called them for the 4th time and told them to come and get their equipment and cancel our service. They told me someone would be here Monday to get all the stuff. But here's the real kicker!

This time I decided to go for and It was around 6 PM when I came in, customer service is OK, but food was the worst ever. I ordered a popular meal that is kind of a standard in every Chinese restaurant, yet they screwed it up. I had to throw it away. \n\nIt was digusting. Fried rice is not good at all and seemed pretty old. They do not seem very clean and obviously hide the kitchen so no body sees their mess. Plus they charge more for the meal than other restaurants around do. Not expensive, but do charge more. With the crappy food, they should be out of business.

Immediately after we paid the check, we were approached by the waitress and told we needed to leave as there were others waiting for tables.  This was at 7:15.  We were not even at our table to for an hour and had the last of our bottle of wine in our glasses to finish.  I have never been kicked out of a restaurant before.  I couldn't even fathom being asked to give up our table.  I could see if we had been there for a bowl of soup and kept the table for 2 hours.  But we had dinner for 2 in under an hour and were asked to leave.  I asked to speak to the manager or the owner, but was told he was in back cooking and was not available.  We left our full glasses of wine on the table and I approached the front on the way out and asked again to speak to a manager or owner.  I was told the waitress was the manager and the only person I could talk to.  We let her know again that we had never been treated this way in a restaurant and would not be back.  We also informed her that we would be sharing this information on Yelp so others will know that they should be prepared to be evicted if they plan to stay longer than an hour.",

  "text": "The burritos are huge and I chose the shredded pork. Okay, now I am really excited! I have not had a burrito this good since living in the Southwest, in fact it was one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to eat. Loaded with spicy shredded pork, rice, beans, peppers, onions, bits of corn, peas and carrots here and there, yes Americanized, but awesome. You do find them with these fillings in the SW, but in Mexico it is a basic spicy meat, rice and beans. Truly remarkable and this alone will bring me back. \n\nThe tamale was wrapped in an real corn husk instead of one of those plastic imitations you find today. The masa filling or corn dough was very dry and bland, there was one good sized chunk of white meat pork in the center and nothing else. The dough was pure white, which makes me wonder if they even attempted to add chili powder or cumin to the mixture and it desperately needed salt and pepper. In an attempt not to waste food, I spooned a good quarter of a cup of salsa on it that was loaded with peppers. Still not loving it, I spooned some refried beans on, I came this close to topping it with guacamole and decided that my stomach had enough. \n\nThe refried beans are good, but once again needed salt and pepper. I always Americanize them anyway by adding raw onion and cheddar cheese. The fresh guac was loaded with chunks of avocado, a nice balance of citrus and tomatoes with a bit of heat, I detected no red onion, but it did taste as if they put onion powder in it. It was still very good and they claim it is award winning. \n\nTorn between the mango salsa or the fruit salsa, I chose the fruit, since it had large chucks of peach and mango in it, as well as blueberries, strawberries, pineapple and sweet red peppers. Well this tall young man who was scooping out my fresh fruit salsa kept knocking the chunks of mango off the spoon. I finally told him to knock it off, not really, but I did ask what he was doing and asked for mango! I mean come on, give it up if you want me to return. It was very good and fresh, a bit vinegary \n\nThey also have a black bean salsa, beans and rice and beautiful looking layered cheese, imported cheese and chorizo, which I do need to try. They carry flour tortillas, as well as corn and a variety of corn chips, canned sauces and peppers. The feta and lime salsa is on my list to try the next time. \n\nThe Chicken Enchilada is small but excellent! Just the right amount of heat and filled with shredded chicken and spices. Of course after my initial bite, which was good enough, I topped it with cheese, heated it a bit more to melt it and added some hot salsa and some fresh guacamole, yum! \n\nThey really do have a great menu of four different taco's, quesadillas, eight burritos including a breakfast one with egg and chorizo, nachos galore, empanadas, chimichangas, Chile rellenos, shrimp cerbice, Mexican slaw and Mexican Jarrito to drink as well as state side soda pops. Hot platters are served with sides. \n\nAll of these Mexican specialties are to each come with sour cream, guacamole and Pico de gallo, when I got home and opened my bag the tall, handsome young man who was hoarding the mango did not give me any, not one little dollop and I'm telling! It was a good thing that I had sour cream and salsa at home and bought the guacamole. Open Thursday through Saturday only. \n\nAdmittedly I over ordered and ate this for days while hubby had two Cornish game hens, corn on the cob and wild rice. I was not jealous and of course I had to make a batch of margarita's to wash it all down. When we went to the Chart House last week, he said, \"Now you can not order everything on the menu so that you can yelp it\". Every party has a pooper...",

  "text": "I haven't been to a Red Lobster in 100 years and I wasn't looking that forward to this lunch when my lunch date chose it. I ordered the Create Your Own Lunch. You got to choose 2 entree choices and a side plus salad. I upgraded the salad to the Lobster Bisque soup. It was a thick creamy soup and a little fishy. For my combo I chose the fried clam strips, garlic shrimp scampi, and the mashed potatoes. I loved the fried clam strips. The shrimp scampi had a decent garlic flavor but I felt it was a little greasy. The mashed potatoes had a good flavor and if they were hot would have been perfect.  My lunch date ordered the Asian glazed salmon. He loved it. I'm sure I'm not alone when I say the best thing going here is the Cheddar Bay Biscuits. They are a bit salty but really good. Service was decent. All in all it was a positive chain restaurant experience. If you're going to spend $50 on lunch I can think of a lot better places though.",

The New England Clam Chowder is hands down the best I have ever had - and I lived in Boston for a few years so I've sampled my fair share!  You won't find a single chewy clam in this chowder!  The Tuna Tataki appetizer is light and refreshing and the subtle layering of flavors is quite lovely. Tonight we also had the Steak Frites which was cooked perfectly with just the right sprinkling of sea salt and a nice bernaise sauce on the side. We also had the Bucatini Seafood Fra Diavalo which was delicious!  Service was friendly and prompt but never overbearing. This is a real local gem and I'm already looking forward to our next visit.",

  "text": "Celebrated a post Phillies victory here last week. I hadn't been in the Rittenhouse Square district in a while, so I asked my friend if we could eat in the area. \n\nThe place was a lot smaller than I imagined, but I loved the ambiance of the bar/restaurant- small booths and high top tables, the subway tile, the old school looking bar. \n\nOur server was very friendly and started us right away with plenty of water. It was amazingly hot that day, so we both passed on drinks. We had taken a look at the menu while at the game, and we were intrigued by their pickle menu. Our server suggested the turnips and kale, and we decided to go with that. The mason jar full of pickled turnips and kale, served with creamy ricotta and olive tapenade was just what we needed, since we didn't have a big meal during the game (and we were pretty hungry). The ricotta spread was creamy, and though I am not a huge fan of olives (i avoid them usually) the tapenade was soooooo good- briny and just enough olive, but smooth without being too overpowering. \n\nMy friend got the veggie burger, and I got a regular burger and we split an order of their duck fat fries. The burgers came out promptly and I loved that mine was this perfectly shaped patty, cooked to order, and I loved the thousand island dressing as the condiment. My friend's massive veggie burger looked good too- it was topped with tons of avocado. The fries were soooo good too- crisp and salty, thick and substantial, without being too greasy. We ate the last crumb!\n\nOur bill was reasonable, considering we didn't have any alcohol- 35 bucks. I definitely will return on a future trip to Philly, perhaps for fancy drinks.",

Now to critique the food.  things that I would say were exceptional; the Dungeness crab legs and the frog legs. I have never seen a bigger frog leg in a restaurant, much less a buffet. The boiled seafood with the exception of the Dungeness were over-spiced with crab boil to the point that they were not good. Most of the fried food was too salty.  For $40 per person I wouldn't return very often.",

The food was good but a couple of the waitresses just don't look happy to be there and we didn't get one smile from either of them the entire time. I've been a waitress, I understand it can be a tough job and maybe not what you want to be doing on a Sunday but customer service still really matters. There was a guy there who was really nice and friendly but unfortunately the 2 women bring down the vibe of the place. Sad because I really wanted to like it. It's a very cute, cozy place with antique looking toys for kids and a good menu, but like I said, it just didn't vibe for us. Definitely worth giving it a try and hopefully you'll have a different experience!",

  "text": "OK, it's a cheap movie re-run theater. And it's good.\n\nAs a father of four children, we've been to our share of cheap theaters in the four states in which we lived. And this one is actually quite pleasant.\n\nFirst of all, the price. $3.50 for regular tickets. Not going to break the bank. $3.00 for seniors, and at this theater, \"seniors\" is age 51 and older! $3.00 for kids. $1.50 on Tuesdays! So for a little more than the price of a Redbox disc (or on Tuesdays, the same price as a Redbox disc), you can see a movie on the big screen.\n\nThis theater was clean. Almost all of the cheap theaters my family has been to have been dirty. This one is clean.\n\nSeats are comfortable. In our screen room, it wasn't stadium seating and I do not believe they have stadium seating at all. But the seats are comfortable and surprisingly look new-ish.\n\nSound system isn't the latest and greatest, but it sure is good enough. I don't feel ripped off in this category at all.\n\nThe movie quality is great. That must be because they are showing it digitally. Cheap theaters used to mean watching worn out 35mm reels and you could see the wear and tear in the movie with lines and visual static. Not here. Picture quality was as good as new.\n\nNice selection of movies, too. Usually at the cheap theaters, they are playing only two to four movies. Here, they have 14 movies playing. You get a nice menu choice.\n\nConcessions are just as pricey as a regular theater. I will say that I did enjoy the Orville Redenbacher's brand popcorn and the Fanta Apple pop.\n\nI'll be back.\n\n5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.\n4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.\n3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.\n2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.\n1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!",

The worst chicken friend rice I have ever had. It was too sticky.\nThe kabobs...same story...one bite and I refused to eat.

Seating was a little tight, but that's probably due to the fact that it's a pretty small space.

The Soju tasted more like cardamom than coconut but it was pretty strong. The wings were good, but I think I'm one of those rare people who are not impressed with Korean fried chicken wings (don't hurt me, I like buffalo wings). My favorite part of the meal was the fried rice it had sausage, kimchi and all that good umami flavor. The poke bowl was just ok, the flavor was good, but it had very little fish.

She helped us make good choices for our meals and kept our coffee cups, water and drinks filled at all times.  Their Wedding soup was superb. I had the fusilli with chicken, sausage and grilled asparagus. It was a great combination. Their noodles were home made and delicious (almost like a long spaetzla) , The swordfish was moist and mild. cooked to perfection. It was so good we went back the next evening for another great meal.",

  "text": "Chill indeed. I made the 45 minute drive from Tampa to attend a surprise birthday brunch here. Our incredibly sweet server, Cadia, helped make everything fall into place. We were given the back room to ourselves where she kept the mimosas flowing. Very accommodating to my food and drink allergies as well. For breakfast I ordered an omelette with steak, cheddar and spinach, which came with home fried potatoes. They apparently ran out of tots but I was going for home fries so it didn't bother me. Everything was delicious and portioned huge. I couldn't finish. The Ginful Desire was a pleasantly refreshing cocktail. Raspberries, lime, basil, and ginger beer. Garnished with fresh raspberries and highly pulpy. Since I can't drink beer, the bartender recommended ginger syrup instead. I spent just under $20 on myself which is on my cheap side for brunch. I would love to eat here again thanks to Cadia's outstanding hospitality. Not to mention the women's restroom is an unexpected mermaid themed oasis!",

  "text": "We had reservations for 3 at 11:30 and arrived on time.  We got seated quickly BUT this is when it went downhill.\n\nWe seriously sat there for a good 15 mins without anyone coming to us for drink orders nor were we acknowledge.  Luckily for them we had met someone the night before and was treating him out to brunch or we would have gotten up and left.  \n\nI flagged down the person that seated us to let them know we have not been helped and she said that she'll send someone right over.  Someone (who wasn't our waitress) came and gave us some water and said our waitress will be right over.  About 5 mins later someone finally showed up at our table.  SERIOUSLY?  HOW COULD SERVICE BE THIS BAD at such a notable restaurant????? \n\nShe took our drink orders and we did not get them until 10 mins later.  Our waters never got refilled during this time.  We also put in our food orders when she took our drink orders.  \n\nIt took a good 30 or so minutes for our food to come out.  Our waitress never came back to check on us during this time to refill our waters or ask us if we wanted a second round of drinks. \n\nBy the time our food came I was not in the mood to eat anymore.  I ordered the Egg in the jar and was really looking forward to it but in the cranky mood I was in, I barely touched it.  I'm sure it would have tasted better if we hadn't been ignored for so long.  The only thing that kept me happy was the conversation that was being had with the company I was with.\n\nIf Luke were real, I would kick his ass!\n\nUPDATE (5/30/14):  A manager at Luke's reached out to me after this review and apologized for the lack of service and extended an invite back.  I will give Luke's another shot.  Stay tuned for another review....",

However, the quality behind that brand is lacking at this point.\n\nWhen it comes to donut quality, this is where their energies need to be focused.  Fundamental baking skills are lacking.  Its more than about how you dress it up, its about the quality of the pastry itself.  Donut Drive-in and Donut Stop kick out a high-quality pastry no matter the style.  \n\nStrange Donuts has brought the magic of Voodoo Donuts to St. Louis but they need to focus on the basic.

  "text": "Went to Khyber Pass Pub last evening with some friends and have to say I was a little disappointed.  After reading so many awesome Yelp reviews we were very excited to try the place out.  Dinner was at 8:00 and we were lucky to get seated right away.  The place was really loud so it was hard to hear what people were saying but we were expecting this since it is a bar atmosphere.  My husband ordered the bacon popcorn and he really enjoyed it but did say it was a little spicy.  He had the burger for an entree and I have to say this was very tasty.  Now on to the problem...I ordered the fried chicken cause I heard it was awesome.  What a disappointment this was.  The pieces were small and were very dried out.  The breading on the chicken reminded me of a shake and bake type of a texture and was one of the worst fried chickens I have ever had.  It's pretty bad when you say that Popeye's chicken was better.  I had the greens as one of my sides which was very very tasty and ordered a Big Ass Biscuit which was blah.  If you are calling something a Big Ass Biscuit it should be really big and not just the size of a Grands Pillsbury Biscuit.  It was very dried out and the butter the offered with it just crumbled the biscuit as you spread it.  My friend who is a Vegan ordered the sausage and she said it was her new favorite for this place.  It's very hard to find restaurants that have so many Vegan options on the menu and this place had a bunch so if your Vegan definitely try this place out.  All in all it wasn't a horrible place and the atmosphere and staff were awesome and friendly.",

All of the servers and other staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We had the artisan cheese appetizer and liked everything, especially the Humboldt Fog.  We get pretty excited about cheese, having lived in WI for 20 years!  Hubby had the Strawberry Bibb Salad, I had the Caesar with sundried tomatoes.  I love anything with sundried tomatoes and this did not disappoint.  I'd go back just for that salad!  I had a tasty scallops entree and my husband had the filet, both very good.  We had complimentary dessert because it was our anniversary...otherwise I'd have to have passed on it because I certainly wasn't hungry anymore!  I ordered strawberry shortcake and it was fine...not wonderful.  My husband, however, had a wonderful key lime pie/coconut cake combo thingy that was fantastic!   We are already talking about going back .  It was perfect for a romantic evening.",

I had the do not disturb light on AND the door knob sign that said I did not want my room serviced. However, I came back one day and housekeeping had been in my room. I'm not necessarily complaining that my bed was made and my towels refreshed, but I did get that uneasy feeling of someone being in your space when you weren't expecting it. \n\n3. There was some water issue in the large seating area outside of the lobby restaurant. They had it closed off and maintenance crews working for a couple of days. Things happen but this meant there was no place to sit and eat breakfast. Since there's no other breakfast options I just stood there and awkwardly ate in the lobby.",

  "text": "It's an hour away but we go every few years or so because my 2 youngest have fond memories of sitting on the \"train\". Well, they are almost 18 now and we were going to see an event in the City and decided to go here last night. We didn't have reservations but it was right before 5 and we're lucky to be seated quickly. It's important to make a reservation if u can tho because it can get crazy busy on weekends. When we left 90 min later, the people were out the door waiting on sidewalks with families. Although it was years since we were the the menu hasn't changed much. A few new drinks have been added and I enjoyed my Sangria. Not really worth the price but when in Nashville..The food wasn't as good as we remembered either. I got the special, the girls and hubby tried spaghetti, the mizithra browned butter thingy, and garlic shrimp alfredo. Only the hubby finished his food. Nobody really wanted dessert either other than me but I like Spumoni lol. I don't know if it was where we were seated but We overheard at least 3 different arguements between staff members and if I was a manager there I'd be cleaning house, firing several. I don't care how busy it gets, there is no excuse for bringing disagreements in front of the guests. Plus another worker had spilled sauce or something behind me as he raised the tray over my head (my husband was like \"Is he seriously putting it over u right now?!\") and no less than 4 people saw it and let it stay there until what looked to be the manager or asst manager noticed and cleaned it up. Why 3 stars then? Because we lucked out and had Andy as our server. My girls adored him, he was friendly and fast and was hustling to make sure his tables were taken care of. He saved the lackluster meal and showed us not everyone there is miserable. Not sure we will return as it sortof ruined our fun memories but if we did we would ask for Andy and gladly wait to be in his area.",

Tender rib meat and home style mac and cheese between Texas toast?! Pretty sure the calorie count was the same as what most orphan children consume in a year but i'm not ashamed.

It is located in a not so good area with limited parking currently as the street is closed but there is street parking and a few nearby lots.\n\nWe like coming here as the prices are excellent as well as the quantity along with taste.  They serve noodle soups, stir fried noodles, rice dishes, entrees such as sweet and sour pork, tofu choices and vegetables such as gai lan and snacks such as dumplings or something light.  This place is popular and we always bump into someone we know.\n\nThere are booths and a few tables and you can seat yourself.  There is nothing fancy here, the water comes in plastic cups and you get Chinese tea.  They give you a menu with an order form and pen so you write down your own order.  The waitress will be around to collect your form or you can bring it up to the front.  Considering how busy it usually is, the food comes out fast.  Once you are done, you can ask for the bill or just walk up to the counter to pay like most customers.\n\nThis restaurant also stays open late so if you are looking for a late night snack or dinner, they are there for you.  No matter what time of day, the food and service is always great!",

  "text": "For the price, you'll get a pretty friggin good steak here.  Morton's and Ruth's Chris still hold my heart when it comes to steak.. but they also could hold a lien on my house to pay for my dinners there.  At J Gilbert's you'll get a nice steak, two sides, an appetizer and dessert for under $100 a couple.  Still not your typical mall restaurant but a nice addition to my steak craving rotation.  I'll definitely be back.\n\nAs the others said, it's a nice little joint.  Not too many tables but we still didn't have a wait at 7pm on a Friday night.  Bonus!  Because the space is on the small side, be prepared for a slightly noisy dinner.  Once the crowds died down it was a lot more comfortable.\n\nHad the Shrimp Durango to start, which had a nice kick to it.  Great with the warm crusty bread served at every table.  We both had the filet combo with a steak (4 or 6 ounces) and a seafood choice.  The lump crab was delicious and the steak was perfectly cooked with a nice smoked flavor.  \n\nApple Croustade with homemade cinnamon ice cream was a great ending to the evening.  \n\nIf you like Manhattans, definitely give this one a shot.. possibly one of the best in St Louis but at $10 a pop, you get what you pay for!",

  "text": "I only knew about Southgate from a video about their brunch menu and how they make delicious korean fusion dishes. Typically I'm hesitant when trying korean fusion dishes as I often feel like the flavors aren't handled properly when trying to americanize or change traditional korean foods (or maybe I'm just a korean food snob? or both??) but I must say... I loved my experience at Southgate this past weekend! \n\nI started brunch off with their kimchi blood mary, which was spicy! I was actually very happy with the spice level but also how they use kimchi to elevate the bloody mary. I didn't think it was too overwhelming which was what I was embracing for. I enjoyed the spicy house-made soju shot that it was paired with as well. It was like a nice little cool down break from the kimchi Bloody Mary :)\n\nMy friends and I decided to do tapas style for brunch so we could taste as many things as possible. Best idea ever! We started with the kimchi deviled eggs which were tasty. Again, I am pleased that they were able to subtly infused the kimchi within the dish, which wasn't overwhelming or overbearing by any means. But it also wasn't just adding kimchi on top of a traditional deviled egg. I believe they blended the kimchi and some sesame oil in the egg mixture which really just made the mixture smooth with a hint of sweet and spicy. They had four pieces so it's easy to share.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the kimchi poutine, short rib and korean fried chicken (KFC) and green tea waffles. It is hard for me to choose one clear favorite, mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. The kimchi poutine was delicious and I loved that the fries and cheese on the stone bowl continued to cook and get crispy even at our table. They don't have any gravy on this dish (like traditional poutine), but it works out very well. Very easy to share. The KFC and green tea waffles were a huge surprise to me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the waffles that much, mostly because I wasn't too sure about green tea waffles... but it was very good! And paired with super crispy KFC was like icing on the cake. I wish the chicken was spicy though, that would have definitely put it over the top for me and been a favorite. Lastly, the short rib dish was good though it doesn't stick out as much as the other two. My friends really enjoyed the short rib itself, but I was under the impression it was suppose to be like galbi so that let me down a bit--still good but just not what I had been expecting. The short rib was placed in a huge bowl with rice, two eggs and jalape√±os. The nice surprise was the sweet soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl, where the rice was soaking it up--it really brought the dish together.\n\nOverall, Southgate is a wonderful place to experiment with Korean fusion dishes. One of my friends had never had korean food before and really enjoyed our dining experience here. I like that they offer a variety of things outside what you'd expect. I will most definitely come back here for brunch the next time I'm in Center City! Especially for the spicy kimchi Bloody Mary :)",

  "text": "I waited a while to write this review, because I have been there a few times and wanted to try a few things before I did.\n\nMomo is by far my new favorite restaurant in New Orleans. At this point, I have tried probably everything on the menu that has even remotely appealed to me and it has all been pretty fantastic.\n\nThe poke is amazing. There are only a handful of places to get poke in town, but this must be the best. The fish is incredibly fresh and very well cut. I worry that sometimes people don't appreciate how much better sushi, sashimi, and poke taste when the cut is good. The other add-ins are very good and the variety is just as good if not better than anywhere else I have been.\n\nThe ramen is good. Honestly, I have never been a big ramen fan, so it was good on a scale of ramen. It was very big. I ended up splitting a ramen so it ended up being a very inexpensive meal.\n\nNow, what I really wanted to talk about - everything else! The crawfish spring rolls are fantastic. They have a few items from the robota grill and they are so simple, yet delicious. The main menu is amazing if you want to go with a  few friends and just split a lot of dishes. The flavor variety is diverse and excellent. \n\nI have also been a bit surprised by how friendly the wait staff is. Obviously the wait staff in New Orleans generally can be very hospitable. But, having been there now a handful of times, they make me feel like family every time I come in. Even if the food was less than amazing, I would probably come in just for the people. \n\nThis is in the old O'Henry's location. That means it is one of the best balconies to eat on in the city. I really like going there in the evening and catching the fresh air. The parking is usually pretty easy for. \n\nSo, in short, I am very glad I stumbled on this place.",

  "text": "Honestly our experience here was a complete joke.  We came on a Sunday at noon, and without exaggeration were the only party in the entire restaurant.  We actually wondered if they were even open.  This should have been our first red flag, but we were already there and thought we should  give it a shot.  Within a few minutes our waiter took our drink order so we assumed we were on solid ground.  But, everyone knows what happens when you assume.   Bottom line, we never saw anyone after that moment.  We essentially packed up and walked out after about 20 min and headed down the road to another restaurant.  I cant possibly imagine what they were working on for 20 minutes since we were the only customers,  there were no other tables!!  Were we on Candid Camera?  Who knows, but what I do know is we most likely won't be back.",

  "text": "We've been wanting to try Kanella's brunch for about a year now and given that we needed to be in the area, we decided to try it out. We stopped in without reservations around 1pm and when my bf told the server we didn't have a reservation but it was his birthday, they did their best to accommodate us. Luckily, one of the tables didn't show up for their reservation so we got to stay! Our server was AWESOME. So eager to help and make recommendations, and super friendly. We decided on the watercress salad and cuttlefish, both of which were specials. We also got the lamb sausage and duck egg breakfast. The food was good, but we weren't OVERLY impressed by anything. We really enjoyed the lamb sausage dish, but felt that it was a bit small. The salad was good, but nothing special. I felt that the flavor of parsley somewhat overpowered the cuttlefish, but I also don't really like parsley so I may have been particularly sensitive. Given the incredible reviews, I'm wondering if we just didn't order all that well, especially because we LOVE Meditarranean food. The service was excellent...the server put a candle in our order of baklava without our even asking. I would definitely go back and try it again.",

  "text": "Gavin Roy was our wedding DJ on March 14, 2015 in Santa Barbara. What a pleasure to work with him leading up to the big day and then his efforts throughout the day were spectacular.\n\nGavin took a couple of phone calls with my wife, Caitlin, and I leading up to the event and was friendly, capable and thoughtful. With his very easy-to-use website allowing us to slate selected songs -- and, perhaps, more importantly, create a comprehensive \"no play\" list -- as well as allowing our guests to share their requests, planning was easy. On the final call prior to the wedding where we went over those choices, my wife and I agreed that we could hear the wheels turning in Gavin's brain as he looked through our music. He seemed, almost, to be putting together playlists right in front of us.\n\nOn the big day, Gavin worked very well with our ceremony guitarist and our officiant at the ceremony site (Santa Barbara Courthouse Gardens), as well as with our guitarist who performed during cocktail hour at the reception (Chase Palm Park Plaza). Once it was Gavin's turn to take over, his playlist and rotation of songs through the dinner hour was impeccable and he handled the announcements of the wedding party and toast speeches like a pro. No silly bluster, just very professional and on top of things.\n\nLeading up to the wedding, we told Gavin we really wanted the last 2.5 hours of the reception to be a big dance party. To say he got that idea would be a major understatement. The dance floor was packed as Gavin hit all the right notes, handled guest requests on site and just kept the party going non-stop right to the end. \n\nWe had an amazing wedding day and Gavin was a crucial player in that. Thanks Gavin! Wishing you the best, and should we ever need DJ services in SB at anytime, know you're our top choice!",

Also, food is not great, fried calamari comes with a very heavy sauce on top, if you get it, order with no sauce. The Pi√±a Colada was amaaazing! Definitely worth a try.

  "text": "Interesting craft brewery near downtown and the baseball stadium, serving specialty craft beer.  Street parking was difficult to find, but once I did, I was glad I made it here. The tasting room is adjacent to the brewery and it was fun and educational to look through large windows and watch the master brewers turn raw ingredients in the large vats into 4 Hands beers.  Each of the ones I sampled had good flavor. There is a wide variety of 4 Hands on tap - the point being that they have lighter beers, more bitter IPAs, double IPAs, porters and stouts and 10-15 others in-between. Try the milk stout -- Wow!!!  For beer lovers in St. Louis or those who visit, please go by and encourage these men and women who are bringing real flavor back to American beer one small batch at a time.

The decor is very clean and contemporary and the ambiance is just as friendly as always. \n\nI'd like to reinforce that last point. In nearly four years of frequent visits to both locations of the French Press, I've never once experienced nor seen any customer be treated with condescension by any of the staff... even when the customer might very well have been acting like an entitled wanky jerk themselves. \n\nIn fact, I can't recall any caf√© or restaurant with friendlier or more polite staff than the French Press. Because I've neither seen nor experienced any evidence to support such claims, and because I've spent quite a lot of time at the French Press over the years, I'm left being forced to assume reviews claiming otherwise must come from jealous competitors or people with warped perceptions of reality...?\n\nAnyways, come for the coffee, stay for the great ambiance and warm, friendly staff. A great place to meet friends or pop in for a snack. Watch for them to expand into pour-over and other exciting new coffee adventures in the near future, too!",

I decided to go for a small which was actually filling and left me wondering how big the regular was. Mine came with steak, refried beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and I added some avocado which was clutch. I could barely finish the whole thing and it was like $3.69! I also ordered some chips and salsa ($3) which were a tasty accompaniment. They had bottles of red hot sauce and green hot sauce to cover each bite with. This cheap burrito with tasty hot sauce made this homesick Texan pretty darn happy. And the lady taking orders was super friendly. I will definitely be back. CASH ONLY",

There is a warm, family like vibe to this business. They are next door to Napa and you can order food and beverages from them. The Napa waitress came in and was very attentive. I highly recommend this experience and my boyfriend walked out with a huge smile and a darn good paining.",

My wife had 2 different margaritas and loved them both. They even had a very specific kind of tequila Casa Noble which is pretty hard to find. Their table side guac was perfect. \nThe food was outshined by the appetizers and drinks but still great food. \nYou will enjoy this place.",

It's somewhat similar to Sabrina's on Callowhill. Same long lines in front of the entrance etc etc. Priced almost the same too. \n\nFood is great. Went for the usual 3 eggs omlette with jalapeno, onions and pepperjack cheese. Was great. And whats the big deal of a good omlette, right? But the truth is, it was just perfect. \n\nThey have an old Orange juice making machine which churns out natural juice from un-peeled oranges. That kinda had me really thinking that this might be the real crowd puller to this place. So, all the people out there who feel a little \"under the weather\" on a Sunday morning, do make it a point to pay this place a visit. \n\nThe staff is nice and friendly. I will definitely visit this place again.",

They gave complimentary souvenir cups (clean) matching the type our drinks were served in.\nI had an oyster po' boy. The oysters were medium sized and still greasy from frying. The oysters were topped with slaw, which was delicious.\nThe poor boy came with fries. I am on a low salt diet, and they tasted very salty to me. My daughter did not find them unusually salty.\nWe were in the back room, but we could still hear the jazz from the stage room.\nIn general, this is a decent place to eat bar food and listen to music.",

Loved it!\n\nOur server was really nice and offered help in choosing a menu item(we wanted it all-true foodies, plus we were starving!). She also made sure our cups never went dry. Oh! And the coffee was just right. None of that watered down stuff here. Good bold flavor too. \n\nOne thing to mention: this place serves breakfast as long as they're open.

  "text": "As a store, this place has grown a lot. I went during their first or second week of opening, and the steak was dry, and lacking in cheese (but hey, that was when it only cost three bucks). Now, a year or so later, they've grown consistent: the steak is chopped, and non too fatty. You can choose either American, Whiz or Provolone- although I prefer whiz, american seems to be a favorite up here (for some reason, I feel sick eating it with sliced steak). You can also choose from an assortment of toppings from the small bar, such as peppers, etc. Onions are good, as I''ve never gotten them raw.\n\nThe menu consists of your staple drinks, fires, and... well, that's pretty much it. Still, they have a mon-fri combo from opening 'til five for only seven bucks. It consists of a drink, plain fries (cheese for a dollar more) and a steak. \n\nPersonally, I think Wit or Witout has made a name for itself in the northeast. I tried a steak from Steve's a while ago, and the roll was sorta hard and whatnot. Though it was lean, it lacked some serious cheese. Give this place a try; the steak is actully a foot, unlike Pat's and Geno's now. And seeing that I live down the block, I'll always be back once in a while. But probably not during Lent.",

The decor is fun, kind reminded me of Joe's Crab Shake and we had a great server. She was extremely attentive and friendly. I point this out because we tried to go here last night for dinner, but the hostess at the podium was rude and wouldn't provide an answer when we asked her how long the wait would be for a table. We ended up elsewhere. That said, the food this afternoon was a OK. We had the crab dip which was pretty delicious and I had the mahi mahi tacos. They were just OK- nothing to write home about, but good enough for the price. I also thought the fries were pretty tasty. I finished off my meal with the peanut butter pie which I recommend highly. It was clearly a frozen variety that was pre-made, but still very tasty. A nice way to spend a rainy afternoon when you can't be on the beach.",

Everyone playing the slots would love to see Lucky 7-7-7 for BIG MONEY!\n\nWhile I was in Tampa, I decided to check out the Seminole Hard Rock Casino. The new South Parking Garage had just opened when I was here. I didn't stay at the Hotel, so this review is based on the Casino.\n\nOh man! The floor was very busy and MOBBED with a sea of old folks, with most slot machines in this big casino being played. I felt very young, like I was walking through a huge and glitzy senior citizen recreation center. I think to myself: As a current working class taxpayer, I really hope those folks are financially stable and not gambling away their Social Security and Medicare checks. (sigh)\n\nThe Casino also has poker tables, Texas Hold Em tournaments, bars, nightclub, restaurants, food court, and the Hard Rock Retail Store. I saw the food here was on the pricey side and it's good that I ate lunch before stopping here. I did some shopping at the Retail Store and picked up some cool Hard Rock pins and t-shirts. This store does not accept the Hard Rock Cafe All Access Card (points program), but they gave me a 10 percent discount for showing the card. \n\nOverall, it's not Vegas, but it's a decent place to play the slots in the Tampa Bay area with very easy highway access to/from I-4.",

  "text": "I was expecting to be wowed by this place and they had some promising options but they mostly fell flat. They have real cheese, the guacamole is house made and they make their own tortillas. The tortilla was the best thing that I could say about this place, which is a good thing because there is a good 4 inch perimeter that had no ingredients on it all the way around the circumference of the quesadilla that I ordered. My choice was called(I think) Mexicana. It had (supposedly)steak, 3 cheeses & pico de gallo, came with salsa and sour cream. I had to order guacamole to get it. Came to 9.99 without a drink. \nThe 8 or so half inch sized pieces of steak were of the poorest grade of meat. Cheese was real but again did not go to anywhere near the edge of the tortilla and was not very thick. The salsa was supposed to be house made but seriously, why bother? It like the guacamole was insipid in flavor. No lime or salt. Very Boring. The Pico? Well, it probably could've saved the day if there were enough on the quesadilla to make a difference but there was not. TINY pieces of tomato and barely any onion decorated the quesadilla. I usually will take leftovers home and feed to my chickens but I didn't even bother.\nPossibly someone who eats a very \"white bread, non eclectic diet might find this a regular option but not myself and certainly not a locavore.\nI was very disappointed like most of the reviewers here. Seems like many come here expecting a unique experience and leave like myself not hungry anymore, but not satisfied. Maybe there are enough people in St. Louis who will try it once to keep them going.",

I have been a couple of times in the last few months and its just not the way it used to be. \nWe were there for dinner a week ago, 5 of us, we got seated pretty quickly then we were just sat and waited. The server was really busy, I'm assuming they were understaffed that night. She was friendly when she got to us but honestly it was a little annoying as we were hungry and didn't want to be there too late.\n \nIt was a pretty good wait  to get our food, my sons plate came out even a few minutes after the rest of us had ours. We could have still been been fine here as we were not looking for things to pick on, hey i know we don't live in a perfect world but  once we started eating nobody's food was hot. I'm pretty sure it had been sitting for a while waiting for the server to grab it.\n\nBtw, the Mariachis were pretty good at first. The music was not overbearing, they were not too close and they did sound good! The girl with the fiddle was a real treat!\nThen they got closer and louder and you know the deal, no more talking as you cant hear unless you shout, oh well.\n\nSorry i forgot to specify this, it was the Oracle rd. location.\n\nUpdate: I was back in this location a few months ago as it is convenient for me and as I mentioned in my previous review the La Parilla locations were always at the top of my list for a tasty dinner . The staff was friendly, we got seated and waited on quickly, the food however was disappointing. I really hate to slam the place again but I really think the owners should spend time trying to figure out whats going on here. There is fantastic Mexican food in Tucson as we all know and these guys should be as good as anyone else, especially given the amount of years they have been around.",

I told him it was a tournament, and he said he was glad he asked because the hull is a bit different. \nI had my boat at a mechanic getting worked on. He had it on his trailer, we met at a boat ramp, he took my boat off his trailer, I reversed back, he drove the boat on. Didn't have to adjust anything. The mechanic couldn't believe the boat hadn't been on before because it fit so nicely. \nThanks guys for a great trailer and amazing service!!!!",

We used to live in sparks by the marina and we love the view and the quiet, plus its next to all the shops. The rooms are clean and pet friendly, which is a nice thing. We love the slots also, whenever we visit we do some gambling and we always come out ahead or break even. If you are looking for a place to stay in sparks away from the \"mini Vegas\" scene I would stay at the Western Village. Its family friendly and centralized.",

  "text": "A few years back Das Racist, a hip hop band, crafted a track about the beauty of being lost in a combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. I've often pondered what Das Racist would've come up with had they called the bay area their hometown. I have no doubt that if they were tracking tunes in this area during the present tense, the song would incorporate the Blind Tiger Cafe and their combination coffee shop and clothing store. I'm not sure there is a better spot in town to get lost and spend a few minutes (hours) enjoying what's around you. The Blind Tiger Cafe is the first coffee shop in the bay area that I\"m completely enamored with. I love the product, the design of the space and the education opportunities the cafe offers.\n\nProduct wise, The Blind Tiger Cafe offers coffee, tea, baked goods, locally brewed kombucha, a Cafe Hey style oatmeal bar and locally made apparel. I've yet to purchase anything from the apparel side, although I see a t-shirt or two in my future. For now, I've spent my cash/bitcoin/credit card on the coffee and baked goods side of the store. My drink of choice has been, to date, the Cafe Mocha with almond milk. This drink blends just the right amount of almond milk and coffee. The coffee taste, which is normally a no no in my book, is one that I've actually come to desire. That's because The Blind Tiger Cafe uses really good coffee. A cup of coffee at The Blind Tiger Cafe is by no means cheap. Adding in almond milk and a tip brings the drink to six dollars or so. But, the drink is vegan and I enjoy the flavor, so I'm ok with treating myself every so often. On one of my visits I purchased my daughter a plain bagel which came toasted. It was served alongside grape jelly. The bagel was pretty big but other than that there wasn't anything that really stood out about it. I guess that's to be expected because people don't visit coffee shops for the bagels.  \n\nThe design of the Blind Tiger Cafe fits right in with the rest of Ybor. It has an industrial look, with its exposed pipes and brick walls. Speaking of the walls, they are covered with graffiti style decorations. One large mural shows the process that coffee goes through before it gets into your cup. It fits with some of the other murals that are featured on the walls around Ybor. \n\nOne of the unique things that The Blind Tiger Cafe offers is an educational opportunity in the form of a coffee class. This class shares some of the different types of brewing processes that the cafe uses and how those brews contribute to the taste of the coffee. I had a chance to participate in the class through a Yelp event and it was a completely fascinating class whether you were a coffee enthusiast (like some of the other Yelpers) or you just enjoy learning new things (that would be me). A Yelp check in to The Blind Tiger Cafe brings with it a coupon for money off of the class. Totally worth it if you have the time and money.",

  "text": "I was not pleased with my service. The location has just been open a week, so perhaps my experience was related to that, or perhaps simply to the stylist I had--but it was acute enough that I will not go back.\n\nThis was my first experience with a Sports Clips. While I knew going in that part of the business model was the \"sports/TV\" theme, they also advertise themselves as \"specialists\" in men's hair. I did not feel like my treatment was elevated in any way unique to their location.\n\nI received their second-tier haircut, \"the MVP,\" which advertises a precision haircut, shampoo, scalp massage, hot facial towel, and a neck/shoulder massage. If all of these were good--it might be a good deal.\n\nMy haircut was NOT a precision haircut. It was done by someone recently out of school. You know when someone is taking their time because they being thorough vs. when someone is going slow because they aren't experienced enough to go more quickly...the second was my stylist. She did not cut confidently. I have a beard, and my stylist asked me a sideburn-related question most stylists ask, \"Would you like me to do anything different with your sideburns?\" I responded, \"No, go ahead and blend them into the beard.\" The next thing I see, she uses the trimmer to chop off my sideburns and then cut a 3/4\" gap between them and the beard. When I looked incredulously at the sides and asked her why she did that she said, \"It was miscommunication on both our parts.\" That is not what you tell the customer. My other complaint with the stylist was that her method of speaking through every step of \"the MVP treatment\" felt very patronizing, as if I was going to get a haircut for the first time.\n\nRegarding the rest of the MVP treatment--it is not that great. The scalp massage had very little pressure to it...perhaps it was my inexperienced stylist. The \"massage chair\" in the back just buzzed...barely vibrated. I asked the stylist to turn it off. Massage chairs in the mall are better. Finally, the neck/shoulder massage, done by a handheld machine, was again lackluster. It is not a massager. It vibrates a bit, but isn't nearly as relaxing as your Homedics or Brookstone hand massager at home. I asked the stylist to press harder on the machine, but it didn't make a difference. Then I just asked her to turn it off. \n\nIf what you care most about is the sports TV during your haircut, this is the place to go. Otherwise--if you're intrigued by the massages, they aren't great. And the haircut is no better than any entry-level salon.",

  "text": "Hands down the BEST gym in the Reno/Tahoe area. I might be biased but I speak only the truth. \n\nI have been a member for at least 5 years, maybe even longer and I have never had one bad day nor have I had to fight for space. SouthRac has definitely done a lot of improvements in their facility and every year they get better and better. \n\nSouthRac has other businesses inside its facility, so depending on what you're looking for, this place can be a one-stop-shop for wellness and fitness. There is a salon, acupuncturist, massage therapist, metabolic testing center and much more.\n\nI typically come in during lunch hour M-F since I work around the area, but lately I've been coming in around 2pm to stay away from the \"resolutioners crowd.\" Don't get me wrong, this place is HUGE that it never really feels \"busy\" in there. But I do enjoy the quieter time of the day. Cardio machines are located upstairs which overlooks 2 basketball courts, an indoor track, 2 racquetball courts, circuit weight training machines, open astroturf and the recently added incline ramp -- Shaun T would say \"Amazeballs\" to this. Strength training machines, heavy weights are mostly upstairs and the Group Ex room as well. They have great Group Ex classes with great instructors. If you ever want to try Zumba, take Dulce or Veronica's class because you will be hooked. Just last year, they also became a Les Mills gym that now offers various Les Mills classes. My favorite area would be the \"Bat Cave\". I do a lot of functional training and the Bat Cave is the best place to do this. The Bat Cave is covered with rubber floors which is great for plyometric exercises. In the Bat Cave you'll find battle ropes, rowing machines (another favorite), spin bikes, suspension training equipments, pull-up bars, lifting platforms, GHDs and also free weights. There are numerous plyo boxes, and even agility ladders that is accessible to all the members. I also appreciate that there are plenty of foam rollers for the members to use. In short, whatever it is that you like to do when working out, SouthRac has it. So really, you wouldn't have any excuse as to why you are not working out here.\n\nStaff is very friendly, always greets you with your first name which I think is very personable and inviting. Locker rooms are well maintained with multiple shower stalls. You will also find a sauna in the locker rooms. I have never used the saunas so I couldn't tell you much about these.\n\nParking can be hard depending on the time of day you come so plan accordingly.  Or just think about it this way -- you're getting in your warm-up walking from your car to the entrance.\n\nAs you can tell, I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Try them out yourself and you will not be disappointed.",

  "text": "~Came here last Friday around 8ish with one other friend --we were both excited that finally a Korean place opened up in downtown Philly again. Food/drink selection wasn't as expected. Where's the pajeon and ddeokbokki?? No makgeolli either and the soju is muddled in a fancy cocktail priced at $12 (with that price I could buy 3 bottles of plain soju a few blocks down at Wine and Spirits!) I guess I was hoping too much that it would be a like Hongdae bar. The location of the bar should have been a dead give away that it would be catering to a different crowd and taste. Actually it's my fault for not reading articles regarding this place beforehand--they did say it was going to offer \"Korean inspired flavors\". Oh, so you are one of those places that add kimchi to food and call it Korean.\n\nI'd probably come back for the wings and sweet potato fritters on a late Sunday night when it's not so noisy. Defintely not going to have the bulgogi burger or spicy pulled pork sandwich again because they were just ehhh. Our bill was about $100 for two people.....geesus we could've gotten 4 large orders of chicken from BonChon or Soho *smacks forehead*........",

  "text": "If you're desperate for sushi, this place is merely okay.  Nothing special.  A real hit and miss.  We were somewhat regulars only because we typically love sushi and there aren't many options in Santa Barbara.  But this place was starting to get old fast.  Each time we order, we never know if it's going to be just ok or gross altogether.  The service make it ok to try yet again if you're really graving for Japanese food.  One day, I wanted ramen and thought I'll just order a simple one.  Soba noodle with tempura, and boy, was this a total flop!  The broth tasted like chicken fat and nothing else.  No seasoning, just piping hot chicken fat broth.  You could even see the raw fat floating at the top of it.   After a couple of sips, I immediately wanted to throw up.  The yellow tail sushi we ordered was old and smelled fishy.  Fresh fish never smells fishy.  This sealed our decision to never go back again.  Then we discovered Yume Sushi.  Thank goodness for Yume Sushi.",

The staff was beyond amazing with educating my group on the ins & outs of making perfect pizza dough, along tutoring us on the science of toppings and pairing our entire experience with wonderful flights of wine (almost bottomless glasses!), it impressed everyone that attended.  I can't wait to come back and have the pizza again, it was amazing.  Every side dish and appetizer we were served was better than the last.  The employees took pictures of our party while we were crafting our masterpieces and I got to spend more time with my clients.  Overall, A+++ evening.  Can't wait to come in the spring/summer and sit on the back patio.  Bonus?  They have a side patio for our four legged friends!",

Since this was our first time we decided to just get a feel for their menu. We ordered crawfish pies, crab balls, fries, & a dozen of charbroiled oysters. I was more impressed with the fries than anything else however my wife loved the crab balls. The oysters lacked that grill garlic flavor and had quite a bit of trash inside of them. I actually chomped down on one that went straight to my gums, OUCH! Needless to say we won't order their oysters anymore if we decide to go back.",

I decided on the cold chicken caprese sandwich, lentil soup, and carrot cake to-go.  The order was ready very quickly, and I couldn't wait to dig in.  I opened the sandwich at home, intending to have \"just a bite\" then save the rest for dinner.   FAIL.  It was so flippin' good - fresh mozzarella, crisp greens & basil, toasted bread, thin sliced chicken, light drizzle of balsamic & olive oil - I ate half the sandwich right then.  Standing at the counter in my kitchen.  Hey - I'm sure some people some where eat dinner at 5:15 p.m., right?  The soup was good, and the carrot cake was outstanding.  Elke told me it had won some local awards, and I can definitely see why.  Sandwich gets an A+, so I can't wait to explore one of their dinners to-go next.  They also just started serving a Saturday night dinner inside the small restaurant part (6 or so tables), so that will be worth a try as well.",

Even after we paid we sat and chatted with no issue.  The Mai Tai is almost ten dollars, but seriously tasty.  The little Hibachi tricks are a little cheesy (like the fried rice heart) but cute.\n\nI left off a star for the price.  The food was good but you pay a lot for the theatrics.

  "text": "Hard to believe I havent written about this place yet. I have been here a few times both pre and post Eli Collins, and I have to say its still just as good as its always been. They make one of the best bloody marys in the city as well as an always delicious burger. It may have changed a bit, but its still awesome. We took a few friends here to celebrate their engagement recently, and everything really worked out nicely.\n\nWe started with a few cocktails, classic mule made with rye for me, and we settled in to a steady conversation of wedding planning and stories of engagement nights. The cocktail was delicious, even with the change from standard vodka in a moscow mule to the rye. The ginger beer and lime combo is bomb.\n\nSo many things on the menu caught my eye, but the one we all seemed enticed by was the whiskey and sage bread with ramp butter. We ordered one for the table and I ordered the pulled pork shoulder sandwich. The bread came out warm and covered in a flour \"pabbit\" the mascot of Pub and Kitchen. It was served on a slate dish with a smear of ramp butter that was deeply satisfying. I could have eaten the entire loaf all by myself. The butter was superb and you could definitely taste the whiskey in the bread.\n\nI was a little bit disappointed when my pulled pork sandwich came out though. When I think of pulled pork, I think BBQ style. Had the sandwich description read porchetta or something of that nature, I would have expected what I got. That being saidm the sandwich was really tasty, an ode to the Philly staple of roast italian pork. It was super messy, I am talking juice running down your arms while you are chomping down messy, but in such a good way. I devoured the entire thing. So tasty. The fries are just as I remembered them, fantastic. They were super crispy.\n\nWe even ordered a dessert to share for the table. It was one for the ages, one of the most delicious panna cottas I have ever had. It was a vanilla cardamom panna cotta covered in a mango sauce. It was the most perfectly textured panna cotta I have ever seen. It had just the right amount of jiggle, so that it quivered in its dish when it was set down on the table. The cardamom was just powerful enough to really bring another level of flavor to it, but not overpower the vanilla in any way. Outstanding. Pub and Kitchen is just as good as its ever been. One of my favorite places in the city. Always worth a visit.",

When I finally got the server, I asked, \"can we order our dinner now? My son is hungry.\" \n\nWe got an appetizer (thankfully, since we were at this place for almost 2 hours..) and that arrived fairly quickly. But after that, we were forgotten about it seems. And then it took forever for us to get our check. \n\nI'm not sure if I would go back based on the fact that they seem severely understaffed. Like I said earlier, the food was good.\n\nWe stopped because we wanted a fairly quick but not fast food dinner. I feel like we could have had a five course meal in the amount of time we spent at Pita Jungle. :-/",

After having my last apartment broken into and not feeling safe, I knew I had to get out of there.  When I moved into Capistrano, I knew I would be in a safe place.  This complex is very quiet, very clean and very close to the UofA, 4th Ave, downtown and other central attractions.  The manager is one of the nicest people I have ever met.  My parents visited last year and were so impressed that the grass was green in March.  The grounds always look incredible.  I am happy having friends and family over.  The best part about this place is all utilities are included, which is nice especially in the summer when you have to turn up the ac and don't have to worry about getting a 300.00 electric bill.  Any concerns that we have had have been addressed in a timely, friendly manner.  I love this place!",

I physically had to remove myself from the store after filling a basket with about 15 books around $120.  I can't wait to go back.\n\nI am an avid book lover and this place is my Mecca! There were only 2 downsides:\n\n1) The used and new books were mixed together so you would find and awesome book only to realize it's $30 \n\n2) Some of the used books are grossly overpriced.  In my hometown in Pennsylvania you can buy beautiful antique books of all sorts from as far back as the 1700's for $7, while the ones from the 1940's at Haslam's were $30-$40!  It's ok I won't complain too much, they are the only store like it around and I am SO happy to have found it!\n\nCan't wait to go back!",

I'm not a Budweiser fan, but the tour and in depth knowledge they share of the company and the beer is pretty cool to see. Also seeing their trademark horses is something to not miss!!",

We also had breakfast there.  Good size portion on the omelet with great ingredients.  Next time we'll try the French toast.  There was a large crowd ahead of us so the owner sent over a few nibbles to apologize in advance.  He understood that the large group might impact our food.  That's service.  They have good coffee as well.  They have inside and outside dining as well as seating at the bar.",

If you get there early enough for a CRONUT or a CHOCOLATE CROISSANT treat yourself.  My husband recommends the breakfast croissants with egg.  Cette place est vraiment incroyable!",

  "text": "Tucked away in a little corner of downtown Phoenixville is an ultra sleek salon that reflects the owners and their young, attractive & stylish staff.  Wendy & Jay have created a chic place for suburban dwellers to stylize their heads (for lack of a better term).  This is an urban style salon located in the middle of suburbia.  Now I'm a guy and don't require much attention, but the girls at Fiber take care of me like I'm a Brad Pitt look alike (well I am - lol!).  I have a few girlfriends that get their hair done by Fiber and they swear by Wendy and Jay for their color and style that fits their desire.  If you're looking for a stylish salon to get your \"doo\" done, then look no further than Salon Fiber.  The prices are really reasonable and the staff is friendly.  Remember, its tucked away in a secret corner of the downtown, so call before you travel to find.",

The concept is just a good tasting simple hamburger but I thought I would be getting something more substantial, but the price does reflect what you get.  It may be that I need to get 2 of these at a time to fairly compare their offerings to other food trucks.  It IS a good tasting burger so do try them out.  Just writing what I am thinking here.",

The fried potatoes for brunch were about the size of the palm of my hand and were frozen and not even fresh cut. The Avocado Chicken sandwich that my girlfriend had, the chicken was about the width of a French fry, was unseasoned, bland, and the bread was hard and dry. Don't waste your money unless you want bottomless mimosas solely and do not order food, which of course, no one would do. The Camellia Grill is going to run this place out of business and rightfully so",

  "text": "My husband went here last night to pick up (3) 12\" cheese steaks (Large on their menu) and (2) two orders of plain fries. The bill came to $51.89! Here's the kicker, they charge $1.50 for fried onions! Are you friggin' kidding me? We also added green peppers and mushrooms to ours for another $6.00....wow. So, now the 12\" cheese steak goes from $10.99 to $15.45. That is rediculous. Like I said, my husband ran out to grab dinner, if I was there, I would have walked out. I understand an additional charge for mushrooms, even peppers...but fried onions? And at $1.50 per add on, the sandwich should have been loaded...but I had to search for the onions and peppers...I did spot the mushrooms...but I would no way say it justified an additional $4.50 on a 12\" cheese steak. In all fairness, the cheese steak was good, but if I'm paying $4.50 to add fried onions, peppers and mushrooms, I shouldn't have to search through the sandwich for them. I'd say the peppers and onions were between diced and minced in size. Will definitely NOT be ordering here again. Just a heads up too, although the fries at $3.99 didn't seem a bad deal...they sealed them in a round foil pan with a lid..so they were  damp with no crunch at all.",
