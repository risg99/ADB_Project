Chef George was cool enough to give me three of their sauces to try which were all good but not the right fit. Then, he brought out the volcano red sauce and man that was a perfect pair!! Coming back here again soon.  Tiffany was our waitress and she was fast and very friendly.",

  "text": "I was visiting my best friends sister on music row and she recommended Edgehill Cafe to us because we were looking to grab a quick bite to eat. I walked in around 10:30 and walked up to the counter and was told the kitchen was closed. Talk about feeling bummed out after looking over their tasty menu options. We were standing outside for about 10 minutes and got called back in because the kitchen was some how opening. I am not sure what happened, but I am sure glad I was able to order my Belgian waffle. I added bananas and chocolate chips for a .50 cent up charge and it took the waffle to the next level. The waffle is made with a cinnamon vanilla buckwheat batter and topped with walnuts and syrup. The waffle also comes with a side and I went with the bacon of course. It was nice thick and crispy. You can tell they only use the freshest of ingredients. The coffee mugs are a pretty decent size which allowed me to enjoy more of my peach white tea. \n\nWhat I thought made this cafe unique was that it served beer. This isn't your typical coffee shop. They have something for everyone. You also order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when its ready. The interior was very modern chic. I loved the tufted benches and light fixture in the larger dining area. They also have a really neat patio and lots of tables inside. I would recommend this place if you are looking to grab a quick breakfast.",

The BBQ seitan was great. I enjoyed the fettuccine Alfredo--it had a strong nutmeg flavor that was an unexpected but festive touch for the holiday season. They have a good selection of Indiana beer. It's great to have a vegan restaurant downtown, and it's a good place to try if you're skeptical of or intimidated by vegetarian food, since they have some traditional comfort foods. The place was busy on a Saturday night, but we were seated quickly and the staff was friendly and attentive.",

The fried potatoes for brunch were about the size of the palm of my hand and were frozen and not even fresh cut. The Avocado Chicken sandwich that my girlfriend had, the chicken was about the width of a French fry, was unseasoned, bland, and the bread was hard and dry. Don't waste your money unless you want bottomless mimosas solely and do not order food, which of course, no one would do. The Camellia Grill is going to run this place out of business and rightfully so",

I used the bathroom before ordering  and when I went to wash my hand I put soap on my hands and tried to turn on the water and it was dead.  No hot or cold water.  No towels either to wipe the soap off.  Lovely.  Now I have to go out to the there restaurant area to wipe the soap off using napkins.  No biggie, things happen.  However, when I mentioned the problem to an employee She looked me in the eye, then turned around and walked away.  2 other employees right next to Her also pretended not to hear me.  So how many others belted out a deuce only to have their dirty hands touch the door, napkins and soda fountains etc.  How are the employees washing their hands? Mama Mia Diarrhea! How do places like this survive?",

It was apparent that they had just been made and the chickpea flour covering was a tasty combination of crunch and chewiness.  With our guests they were gone in a heartbeat.

I shared several intimate lunches over the years at Sunset Grille with native Nashvillian, John Siegenthaler. So the location holds special memories for me. I was apprehensive about visiting the \"super hip\" and \"trendy\" Biscuit Love for fear of having to stand in line with tourists and hipsters with their beards w/ wool skullcaps that have become the rage in determining local restaurants success. I found neither. \n\nThe place was quiet, the staff super friendly and \"loving\". Reasonably priced, for Nashville, the food was awesome. The coffee was intense and I am sure sourced \"locally\". I really enjoyed it. As I sat there thinking about my last lunch with John, I could see that this would have been a place we would have enjoyed together. A win for the locals, the tourists, and the beards! Watch out Pancake Pantry, there is a new breakfast joint in \"the Village\"!",

I thought the flavors balanced perfectly. Compared to other bibimbaps I've had in the past, the one I had at Southgate wasn't too heavy on the sauce. The ingredients were also seasoned just right, so that the main star of the dish was the actual salmon. While I don't drink, I was also extremely impressed by their drink specials.

It was very weird and not aesthetically pleasing. The inside wasn't bad looking by any means I just felt the name \"mason jar\" didn't really fit the ambiance. I guess I expected something more rustic and homier.\n\nWhen you walk in you enter the line to order and there's two huge menus on the wall. They have burgers, sandwiches, salads, desserts, a kids menu, and daily specials. They also serve alcohol here. The lady who took our order at the counter was so sweet and gave exceptional customer service.\n\nOnce we took our number we got our drinks and sat. There were several people ahead of us but the food only took maybe 10 minutes to come out. I had ordered the shrimp poboy and my boyfriend had ordered the angus cheese burger. My shrimp poboy was just average and the fries had way too much Parmesan on them. My boyfriend didn't care for his burger at all but he's a much harder food critic to please than I am.\n\nOther things about this place: you can call ahead and pick up orders through the drive through.

  "text": "Went last night before his company Christmas jamboree and the food and service were wonderful!\n\nThis place was moderately busy on a Friday night, we were way overdressed because we had to do his party afterwards. The hostess was quick to greet us and super friendly.\n\nWe were led to a booth and our server was Katie, who was on the ball and incredibly charming. I ordered the scallops, subbed out mashed potatoes for the rice and my food was perfect. The scallops were perfectly cooked and succulent. The mash was tasty and even the vegetables were fantastic. The two drinks I had were really tasty and strong too, the bartender is on it! \n\nMy date had the steak which comes with a killer marinade and was perfectly cooked and juicy. I was delighted with my scallops but the steak was so good! I wish they would do a surf and turf! \n\nFinished with cheesecake that was dense and creamy and it ended the night perfectly. \n\nBathrooms were cute and clean with kitschy beach signs in the stalls. The crowd was upbeat and the staff were all smiles and laughter. \n\nWonderful. We can't wait to go again!",

As most reviewers have mentioned, purchase tickets in advance - there was a line out the door and with reserved seating you do not have to worry about the line. The performance was at 10:15pm, they opened the doors at 10pm. We arrived around 9:50, checked in and went to bourbon street, which is next door, grabbed some drinks and headed right in before they started. I hope to see this band in the future again!",

Always found them to be the most honest and reliable mechanics I'd ever encountered and as a result I've sent a ton of business their way. Sadly I can't say this about the new owner, Tim. This guy definitely doesn't stand by his work. \n\nA year ago my car had an engine failure. After discussing with the mechanic we decided to replace the engine. That's when the nightmare started. A year later and after $5000 spent I'm still without the car. The mechanic admits they can't or don't know how to fix it but the owner refuses to give me a refund. I've been beyond patient giving them every opportunity to make good, but Tim can apparently care less about his clients. \n\nFair warning, they DO NOT Guarantee they're work. If they screw up, you'll be eating the cost and may even be without a vehicle. Not worth the risk. Find another shop. I sadly have to now prepare a filing court one year after I have them my car to fix so I could pass it on to my daughter.",

But where in Santa Barbara is easy for parking?! This place makes that all go away. Service is outstanding. I accidentally left my CC there for a week. They remembered who I was, and had it waiting for me. This just doesn't happen in today's service related establishments. I've since taken family and friends to experience this first hand. Funny that I haven't got to the best part. Their food is off the charts. I frequent this place for breakfast while I'm working in the city. I've had lunch here a couple times. Same as B-fast. Doesn't disappoint. Highly recommend the Santa Barbara local omelette, add try-tip. A lot of food but you have to try it. I could go on and on. One last thing. One of the waiters there asked me my name after my second visit. Several weeks later, ran into him. Remembered my name. Just great food with sincere friendly service.",

The woman had to help me dress and clip the shirt on. She was very professional and it was a wonderful shopping experience. The store itself has so many great unique things. I wanted to buy it all. Don't miss this neat little shop. Also--- the prices are very reasonable. Nothing like some of the other boutiques. You could very easily get a one of a kind outfit with accessories for less than $100, maybe even less than $75. I love this store",

  "text": "Disappointed today. Took my family to the Christmas show and had a blast. Went to the Brew Brothers and was very disappointed. We started out with chips and salsa with the guacamole. I tasted the guacamole and it was spicy to me. Even my wife who likes spicy items said it was a little hot, and she's Mexican. I asked the waitress what was in the guacamole and she did not know. Later she said it was jalapeño. I'm can't have anything spicy due to an ulcer. I told the waitress why don't you tell people it has jalapeño in it? She did say anything.             So we order and I had the smoked chicken and pineapple. At that time I asked for more water and my daughter asked for ranch. A few minutes later our food arrived everyone but mine. The waitress said it would be only a few minutes. So everyone started eating. 10 minutes later I man came over and apologize for my dinner said they had some problems in the kitchen and it would be a few minutes. So about 5-7 minutes my chicken arrived. Now my family was mostly done eating. I looked at my plate and it's small chicken peace's with chunks of pineapple. Not much chicken. The bbq sauce was lightly poured on to it. So I tried it and no smoke flavor and it was very dry. I was expecting a little more the that.  The waitress forgot our water and ranch dip we had to ask several times. No apology or compensation for the spicy guacamole or dinner issue. I'm not saying I should get a free meal but come on, try to make it right!",

  "text": "We had a Noritz N-084M with an error 98- which is a combustion error- basically Gas of Fan issues; this is a large Tankless rated for 5+ bathroom homes.  While i'm a high functioning DIY'r- these types of repairs (involving Gas) are best left to Plumbers.  My experience with most Electricians and Plumbers over the last 10 years has not been good- ridiculous pricing reflecting a disconnect from reality and common sense- AND most are so incompetent- one plumber quoted $400 to replace a pressure reduction valve- a $20 part and a 15 min repair.\n\nNow we had a pretty good idea of what the repair would be- which most plumbers don't like - but the Lee Technician that showed up- John (their tankless guy) was great.  \n\nLow key but very knowledgable- which makes you forgive his lack of responsiveness with respect to time; he was about 3 hours late ;)-  but actually that gave us time (my tenant and i) to pull apart the unit and start in on some of the work- he showed up- took a look at what we had done (made sure we didn't make any egregious errors)- he took over and finished up- spotted a small leak that had caused corrosion in one of the electrical harnesses.  He cut the harness and direct wired it. \n\nHis work was excellent, his demeanor should be a training video for all in home subcontract technicians (great ability to read the room), he was respectful and informative and a general pleasure to be around- the entire visit was probably around 3 hours- although, i left after about 90 min.  He let himself out and my tenants didn't even know that he had left.\n\nI got the bill a couple of days later and thought it was very reasonable- in-fact - he probably under charged and over delivered....  how often do you hear that !\n\nwe've built several homes over the years and are not the typical call for most of these types of contractors- i have been reticent to call a company the size of Lee- as it is hard to maintain quality when a company grows past a certain head count- my hats off to Lee- we will definitely put them at the top of our call list when we do our next reno in the spring\n\nthanks so much !!",

  "text": "Let me start out by saying that the food was excellent though my main course of a fish stew was at best warm when delivered. The different courses were very tasty and even with the relatively small menu - there was enough variety that anyone should be able to find something that they would like. \n\nA restaurant experience relies not only on the food, but also the ambiance of the place and that is where Zeppoli is definitely lacking. The restaurant  is small and the tables are extremely close to one another and also relatively tiny. We felt like we were on top of the people near us. We had a party of six and the waitress had difficulty even trying to place food on the table without us having to either remove or shift our plates around. It is also pretty noisy. It was difficult to hold a conversation with a person across the table. The seats are also small, wooden and after 75 minutes we were all kind of shifting in the seats to find a comfortable way to sit. \n\nAgain, the food was very good and the Italian donuts that we had for desert were absolutely worth the calories. Figure on spending approximately $60 per person (incl. tip) and without wine (BYOB). Overall, the experience though good was not the off the chart experience we had heard about.",

  "text": "We stayed at the NOPSI Hotel for 5 days and 4 nights. This entry covers two reviews: one is for a dinner and the other is for a breakfast.\n\nOn the 7th of December we did not get enough of the local food on our first dinner round so we decided to indulge in some more. After looking at the menu we could not really see many choices that are considered local or, at least, at a decent price (most of the stuff is on the pricey side). As I considered my options I eventually identified a few and I decided I was going to eat some fish so I ordered a black drum for $24 (not specifically listed on the menu because it's the catch of the day and it was disguised as \"Louisiana Gulf fish\"). As a drink I ordered an iced tea, nothing that deserves paragraphs or standing ovations so I will not digress on that. The seafood arrived a reasonable time later. It consisted of stacked slices of fish on top of some dark beans pointing towards the center of a plate with a buttery sauce drizzle. The dish itself was good and enjoyable. It had a bold but sophisticated flavor that you find in fine restaurants. From what I tasted it seemed to me the cook knew what he/she is doing.\n\nOn the morning of the 8th of December we woke up early and we decided to have breakfast at the restaurant. The weather was horrible (cold and rain) so we decided to start the day in a relaxed way. We arrived early in the morning (0700-0730), a great time to have breakfast because I like quiet places and the place was quiet. We ordered Belgian waffles (spelled Belgiam in the menu in the room). Since I don't like butter in/on most stuff, particularly on waffles, I asked not to put butter on the waffles. After 20 minutes our food was not yet available. Considering the fact the restaurant was deserted and we showed up rather early, I came to the conclusion they must have went to Belgium to get the waffles. After a while I looked over and I read the mannerism of our waitress. The entire thing translated into \"he does not want butter and there is butter on these waffles\" which in turn translated into \"you gotta do them again lady cook\" so in the end I believe we waited about 30 minutes before eating. When the waffles arrived (presumably from Belgium) they landed on our table and they had a nice appearance. The syrup that came with them was sweet and tasty. It wasn't the regular cheap waffle syrup you find at IHOP or Denny's. It had a higher quality, it was pure cane syrup and I could taste the difference. The waffles were good but they eventually got chewy after a while. Still, they were good, a little pricey ($12) but nonetheless a good way to start a day.\n\nThe service at night was good so I cannot complain about that. Our waiter was patient although somewhat unprepared in terms of mannerism and the way you would talk to customers, almost as if shy or on the first day at work. The service in the morning was mediocre. The lady serving us was a little stiff, disappeared for a long time.\nThe thing I liked the least about the restaurant was that the utensils were sitting directly on the table. For a place with a nice, relaxed and sophisticated ambient like the one in this restaurant forks and knives on the table a big minus in my book. Aside from the fact it's not elegant, it's not even clean. I wonder how this place can pass regular health inspections. Luckily, the manager on site at night understood the point when I asked for clean utensils and helped promptly. The person who served us in the morning paused when I asked for clean utensils (almost as if my request was totally unreasonable).\n\nI have one suggestion to the management which has two facets: train your personnel to be more friendly and relaxed and never take utensils back to the kitchen before bringing clean ones to the table (I am not sure to this day we got clean forks and knives at breakfast).\n\nI would give 4 stars to the place but the service can be improved and the utensils mustn't lay on the bare table so I can only award 3 stars.",

I ordered a side of broccoli for $10 expecting the best due to the price of a side only getting stalks that had no taste and barely resembled broccoli.

  "text": "Hubbard's Marina Offers 5 hr trips that go out about an hour offshore, fish for 3 hours, and then travel an hour back to trhe dock.  I do not recommend  these 5 hour trips to experienced ocean anglers. Simply put, this 5 hour trip does not go out far enough or deep enough to get to large grouper, large snapper, amerjack, tuna and other larger fish that most of us experienced fisherman are looking for. It is strictly 3 hrs of bottom fishing for grey snapper, hogfish, sand perch, and many other fish that are not very big at the approximately 50 ft depth they fish at on these trips.  I went on 10 trips from December of 2017 through July of 2017, then quit going because I never saw a fish bigger than 6 lbs caught on any of the 10 trips. This 5 hr trip, in my opinion, is a good experience for tourists, and children, but not for serious fishermen.  The pictures of all the huge fish they display on their website and emails, I conjecture, were probably taken from rare instances over long periods of time, and from the more expensive longer trips to deep waters.",

The decor is awesome as well, very unique and and fun. What I find really disappointing is the service. The past few times I've been in I've had the same male server who has been less than stellar. We wait maybe 10 minutes to give an order, waited 30 minutes for our first drinks, and then another 20 for the check. I would have loved to order a couple more drinks and maybe some desert, but waiting on the server 30 minutes per drink is something I don't have time for. The other staff seemed to be working really hard and even helped us out a little when our server was no where to be found, I wish I would have had one of them instead.",

  "text": "Okay so I have to start this review by saying (1) that the food was actually really good and (2) that this was one of the weirdest experiences of our entire lives.\n\nWe came here to use my $30 off birthday certificate and it was also our first time at Benihana.  We'd been to Hibachi before so somewhat knew what to expect but went into it with no expectations.  We sat down with two other couples and immediately knew this was going to be a weird night.  The couple next to us told us that they were regulars and came roughly once/week so we leaned on them for guidance and expertise.  I ordered the Rocky's choice and my husband got the teriyaki steak - both were good but the problem was our experience.  Immediately my water was overfilled and the woman to the other side of the table made a huge deal about it and we knew that they were going to be persnickity and make all of the servers and chefs very flustered and because of that my husband and I just tried to smile, laugh and enjoy our date night and not pay attention to them.  They went on to correct the chef multiple times during his presentation, tell the servers that they were getting them the incorrect sauces, extra dressings, multiple waters and sodas even if they weren't finished with the ones that they had (people, i tried to tell you that this was the weirdest experience we've ever had).  With how shaken the staff was, our presentation was not the best and our food wasn't cooked properly because the chef had to cater to this couples ridiculous demands (more butter, cooked more, i want my vegetables and meat mixed together, cut my meat in the opposite direction).... and then the weirdest part was that the couple ordered an additional steak which when the server went through to ensure that our orders were accurate was never brought up but then when the couple didn't receive it at the end of the meal were OUTRAGED.  To the point where the manager came over and assured them and guaranteed that he put the steak on the plate himself (he didn't) and they called his bluff and everyone got even more uncomfortable.  phew.  Now they forgot my white rice as well as the entire table's ice cream and tea and gave us the incorrect check twice.  The bathroom floors were incredibly sticky and gross and two people at our table had to request new flatware or plates because they weren't cleaned properly.  This review is after a dinner on a Monday night so maybe it was just an off time for this crew and I know that the customers were not helping the cause but we're not willing to try again to find out if it was just a fluke.",

  "text": "This place has grown on me over the years. I find myself going here more and more, despite the (fantastic) proliferation of coffee places in the northern Camden County area. It's just a solid place to come back to again and again, and hopefully this'll give you some insight into why.\n\nLet's start with the seating. It's got a lot of different areas to hang out; aside from two large seating areas on either side of the counter, there's an awesome courtyard right on the corner of Haddon and Redman Avenues and plenty of sidewalk seating out front for the warmer months. Not enough places in the suburbs have outside areas for hanging out, so these spots for people - and puppy - watching is much appreciated.\n\nTheir coffee's always been pretty good, and I think they keep switching up what beans they get. From what I can remember, I've seen Rival Brothers, Square One. They do pour overs, which I love, and they've got some more exotic things sometimes, like the Gibraltar (a variation on a cortado) and the \"Americola\", a fascinating mix of Mexican coke and a shot of espresso. To eat, there've got a variety of pastries like muffins and homemade pop tarts and quiches.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that this is one of the only coffee places open on a late Sunday afternoon/early evening worth going. There're a lot of coffee places around here, but they all seem to close between 1 and 3PM. For years now, Jersey Java's open open til 6PM on Sundays, which I really appreciate. I don't know if the other places think people just hide out at home on Sunday afternoons or what, but it's great this place stays open.",

Sometimes you have to wait for your food but it's a tapas restaurant; things come out as they're prepared. In nice weather I always enjoy the outdoors seating and summer drinks. In winter it's cozier seating inside this old gas-station turned restaurant. Fun & funky decor. But come for the food! Best hummus (King of Kings) but just know it's heavy on the tahini (it's in the middle so you can swirl in as much as you'd like). Zucchini carpaccio (it's actually grilled think ribbons) is sublime. Charred tomato bruschetta... these are my go-to three choices and it makes for an amazing and delicious vegetarian lunch. My friends always get the egg salad (w/anchovy) and rave about it.  Home made breads. The larger dishes all look beautiful and scrumptious. They also do an honest and generous wine pour-/ which I always appreciate!",

Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don't expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it.

  "text": "Ok so we finally made it to the Wesley Chapel location! The bar service was excellent! the food was good! The service was...stupid!\nI don't mid paying 20.00 for fried chicken or scallops or pizza but when you take 35 minutes to serve 3 people at 9:30pm when the restaurant was down to 15 guest and 7 people in the kitchen, is not acceptable. My wife has never had Frangelico and coffee so I decided to order her one, epic fail! Coffee was stale to the point of overwhelming the Frangelico! Sad! And when I pointed it out to the manager who said I'll make a fresh pot, well I guess he did but forgot to serve it? So waitress #3 finally showed up with the coffee and Frangelico 45 minutes later we could careless at that point!\nIf you want to make it in the restaurant business service is everything! Your people need to be better trained and have there head in the game until closing not before but all the way to the end! You can deduct all of the items you want from a bill but if your service and food doesn't cut it your doomed!\nWe will give you a second chance but lets get it together and make it a goto restaurant in Wesley Chapel",

Sweet potato fries were good. \n\nToday while at lunch with a group of colleagues the most disturbing thing happened. I noticed the manager in a green sweater lingering around the entrance and then two cop cars with lights flashing pulled up and 3 officers rushed in walked to the table next to us that the manager was pointing to and one of the officer's proceeded to pull out their handcuffs and tell the guy delivering food to put food down at the table and hands behind his back. They escorted him near the front door and had him sit down for a moment before taking him outside in freeZing cold with no jacket where he stood for a few minutes while cops came in and out of restaurant. \n\nThis entire thing was poorly handled, disturbing and unsettling not only to the customers but the other staff. They should have had the cops walk back away from where customers were and deal with it there. Then all the managers disappeared not available to talk to any of the customers let alone apologize or acknowledge people being unsettled. \n\nNo one needs to know why the arrest happened but there needed to be more care for customers and staff in how it was handled. \n\nNot ok!!!",

  "text": "Stopped in here on a Friday awhile back. No one acknowledged me when walked into the store for a good 5 minutes. Finally the assistant manager came over to talk to me. I told him what I was looking for new wheels/tires for my Jeep. He said that the bolt pattern is rare (people change their wheels/tires on Jeeps all the time, so don't know what that was about), but said he could find me some wheels to fit. He also gave me some false information regarding the size of the wheels, saying I couldn't go with a certain size of rim, even though I know people with the same Jeep that have that size rim. Anyway, he took my number down & a few rim styles that I liked, & said he would call me back the following Monday after checking with the warehouse. He never called back. I finally called almost a month later, & he gave me three different rim style numbers & said to look them up on Google & see if I liked them. I did, but they were none of the styles I had looked at in the store. I called him back to tell him which one I liked since we hadn't even talked a price yet. I had told him I was on a budget, & wanted to stay under a certain price, preferably. He came back with a ridiculous price point that was way above what I said I wanted to spend, with no options for anything cheaper at all. Maybe the other RNR locations besides Fletcher are different. but I definitely will be looking elsewhere for rims/tires. I know this place is supposed to help people with poor credit, but they are really screwing people over if that's the service & prices they are offering.",

  "text": "Upland Nachos\n\nA coworker and I took off early on a Friday to enjoy shooting some guns at the local gun range and then enjoy some food and drinks nearby at Upland Brewery's Tap House in Carmel, IN. Upland Brewing Company is actually based out of Bloomington, IN but this tap house in Carmel is a nice little getaway as not only do they have delicious craft beer but great food too! On this particular visit we shared two dishes. This review is focused on the Upland Nachos with Pulled Pork.\n\nTo start my review let me begin with the APPEARANCE of this dish. I will be honest that my first thought was \"Wow, that's a lot of tomatoes!\" and the thought had crossed my mind that there was just way too many vegetables on this plate. As I look at the picture above and refresh my memory of the plate the look of the nachos is very eye appealing as the tomatoes have a fresh and vibrant red color and the placement of the fresh jalapenos really jumps out too.\n\nNachos are a tough dish to review because there's two main trains of thought on the cheese. One train says to use runny nacho cheese and pour it over all the chips and stuff. The second train says to use shredded cheese and melt it at the end. I tend to lean more towards the first train when it comes to nachos...nacho cheese that's gooey and sticky and that unique after taste that nacho cheese has over cheddar, mozzarella, or colby jack cheese. So putting my \"preference\" aside on how I like my nachos, the overall flavor profile of this plate is quite astonishing. The pulled pork topping is definitely a bonus, but the nachos by themselves without the pulled pork are still worth a taste. If you get a little bit of everything on a chip then it will EXPLODE your taste buds. The veggies are crisp, the chip is crunchy, you do taste the cheese, the black beans add a really good texture and a bit of a salty salivating left hook of flavor. Depending on if you have the jalapenos in the middle, bottom or top will determine when the heat and bite of the jalepeno come in but it's a great accent flavor to the bite. The pulled pork was more sweet than tangy for pulled pork which was a good compliment to the bite and heat of the jalapeno. The sides of guacamole, pico de galo, and sour cream are available if you'd like but it will make for a very messy chip if you try to get all three of those on top of what already usually comes on a chip.\n\nThe only \"negative\" I could come up with is a challenge that every order of nachos has...getting cheese on every chip. The chips on the bottom middle of the plate are always bare by the time I get to them. The struggle is real for the nachos out there...all the chips just aren't getting treated fairly. The ones on top get everything...but those on the bottom get nearly nothing besides the scraps the chips on top leave for them.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOverall...the Upland Nachos at Upland Brewing Company Carmel Tap House are great for an individual or sharing with friends. Pair it with a nice craft beer of your choice and you've got great food, great drinks, great friends, and a great time!",

Thankfully, yelp has the new handy reservation feature and I was able to make a reservation from the app just 30 min from when I looked. That gave me enough time to jump in the car and make it for my reservation! So simple and super useful on a Saturday night!\n\nFirst off, the modern decor inside the historical building makes for lots of easy conversation. There are some really cool, old city planning maps and trendy butcher block table tops. I loved everything about it! \n\nI also loved that when I sat down, some very delicious cornbread fritters were delivered. They are so tasty and have the perfect amount of jalapeño kick balanced with a bourbon honey sauce. \n\nThe cocktail menu is definitely worth making a couple visits for. I got an Albee's Knees and it was the bees knees! I'm not usually a fan of gin, but this cocktail was delicious!\n\nWe ordered an Artichoke, Cheese and Kale dip appetizer. It was heavenly! I would go back exclusively for the dip! It was served with fresh pita and was a great appetizer. \n\nI couldn't decide what to order for dinner, but landed on the shrimp tacos and was happy with my decision! The corn tortillas were very crispy, almost tostada like and the spicy slaw and cojita was perfect! I would definitely order them again.\n\nI was too full to try any dessert, so I'm going to have to come back! The Mac and cheese bites are also calling to me, so it won't be long!",

The rings were beautiful, but the service was phenomenal. The lovely lady that helped us (Kim) was not pushy but was very attentive. She was really good at pulling out ring after ring for me instead of just waiting for me to point out specific ones. I felt like I could take a close look at a wide variety of rings when I didn't know exactly what I wanted. She was also great at finding things at our price range; at one point I found a couple I liked that were too expensive, so she isolated similar ones that were cheaper. We got a same-day sizing on the ring for free. We had a fantastic experience, thank you!!",

Am amazing place for sushi in the city. We were there for what they were calling their soft opening, where apparently they are testing out menu and cocktail items for their \"official\" opening sometime soon. We were very pleased with the ambiance, service and food/drink. The fish is top quality. We said hello to the owner/executive chef and he seemed to be beaming over his accomplishments, rightfully so! This is a must stop if you're a sushi/Asian fusion fan. We look forward to seeing what's in store for Tuna Bar and are thrilled to have this a two minute walk away!",

  "text": "We dropped by 21st Amendment for some late-night cocktails in French Quarter without going to the rowdier spots. Given that this was close to where we were staying (the Marriott), it was easy to pop out and roll over to 21st Amendment, which was only a few minutes away. There wasn't a line outside, but it was packed by the time we made it inside (sometime between 10-11 PM)...standing-room only, with the seats at the high-top tables and the bar taken. The decor and ambiance is a bit more retro, but like all New Orleans spots in this fashion, it feels homey, and it was enhanced by the fact that the band in the bar playing live music was absolutely entrancing the audience, with some folks even doing some dancing right at the front.\n\nThat said, I did come here initially because it was rated highly for drinks, and on that front, the cocktails do not disappoint. The bartenders make the drinks expertly, whether you stay on-menu or stray off by giving some general preferences. The beer selection is more generic, with specific bottles being the big-label brands, and no names given for listings like 'seasonal' or 'IPA'. Nonetheless, the drinks are made quickly but consistently - something I appreciated given how busy it was that night. Pricing was reasonable, relatively speaking - $13 a cocktail is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good, making it a bargain compared to some places in New York that I have been to.\n\n21st Amendment really has a nice cozy feel to it, and with great drinks and great music, it's hard to go wrong. It doesn't have the kind of 'fun' you'd find half a block over on Bourbon Street, but at my age, it's the kind of fun that I'd rather have. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",

Their food actually isn't bad for a bowling alley. But that was far from what I wanted my first meal of the day to be..  So my bookmarks showed that we were close to Turning Point, and the debate ended... They closed at 3, and we walked in at 2. Plenty of time to have brunch.. She chose the OMG French Toast. That came loaded with candied pecans and chopped bacon. I went with the Huevos Rancheros... Both we're very good choices. Her dish was, well, sweet!! What else would you expect out of a 10 year old... My dish was great. It was huge... I thought I was hungry, so I ate the whole thing.... Savory and spicy.. Avocados and sour cream on the side to balance the meal... I enjoyed this meal so much that I needed a nap in Pinsetters parking lot before going in....  The service at Turning Point was attentive, but not overbearing. The menu offered plenty of dishes with enough of a twist to not make it the norm, as if you were at an average restaurant or diner. \nI don't really remember how this place got into my bookmarks.

From the decor, to the drink list, the owner, Peg, has worked tirelessly to create a Whiskey Bar that celebrates the brown liquid through and through. The pours have all been carefully curated for those looking to enjoy all that whisk(e)y has to offer. Her passion really shines here. Would absolutely recommend to anyone who's a fan of fine distilled spirits. Will absolutely be making the trip back to visit the next time I'm in town.",

I had the pangang curry with chicken for $10 (comes with white rice). Got full on about half of it, took the rest home and had it for lunch the following day. The food is served to you in to-go style Tupperware so it's perfect for leftovers. Can't wait to visit this restaurant again and try their lunch bentos!",

  "text": "I wish I can rate them without a star. I am currently here at The Inn at Opryland, A Gaylord Hotel, we have been here since Wednesday Dec 27, 2017. It was Friday night (Dec 29, 2017), came back from a long trip got to our room and they did not clean the room, NO one clean our room. We called the front desk and we spoke to a man, called himself the \"manager\" and instead of rectifying the situation, blaming us that we are at fault, because we left the sign on (DO NOT DISTURB). We did not have signed on at all. We wanted them to clean the room since we are going to be gone for the whole day and we place was really a mess when we left. The manager did not even apologize for their mistakes. We also did not have any clean towels to used. The management was arguing rather than fixing the problem. Today is Dec 30th, I went out of the door to find a housekeeper, one was walking in the hallway and I asked her a questions about our room, and she said \"sorry me no speak English\" I knew she was lying. I should have called ICE (homeland investigation for undocumented).\n\nI am writing this review because The Inn at Opryland only wants your money, they don't care about you. They don't care about your concern. until now no one came to clean and bother on our concern. I am from California, San Francisco Bay Area, this is my first and last time here. I was charge $249 a night and double during New Years. THIS IS A CRAP HOTEL. It is noisy, very small tub and bathroom. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, go to Hyatt, Hampton, Holiday Inn Express, but NEVER HERE... STAY AWAY.",

  "text": "Another great taco place near USF! The menu is easy to read and if you have any questions, the employees are very helpful in answering them. I wanted to try everything but had to control myself so I went for a tostada and and three tacos. \n\nThe service is super fast. As soon as we sat down, we were already given our waters and within 5 minutes, our food followed. Both dishes came out extremely fresh and hot. The tostada's ingredients were layered together to create a perfect bite. The beans, cheese, and vegetables complimented each other so well with the crispy base. The tacos weren't as impressive but they were still yummy. I wasn't a big fan of the corn tortillas because it was kind of bland and chewy. The carne asada meat was flavorful but the lengua (beef tongue) had an iron/gamey taste unlike most other Mexican places. The sauces that are given on the table were really flavorful, the red sauce had a smokey peppery taste while the green one (extremely hot) had a citrus/jalapeño like mixture. \n\nThe restaurant is very clean, has plenty of seating, and I definitely will be back to try the other menu items!",

We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. \nIt was around 6 pm, so we reached for the happy hour menu (4-7 pm M-F).  Both my friend and I got the Tavern Jalapeño Margarita. I think this is my new favorite drink! Slightly spicy with charred lemon and unique deep flavor. Most importantly- not sweet! Perfection!\nWe shared the sandwich shooters. They are the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I had higher expectations. The tomato bisque was kinda bland, and the baguettes were not anything to write home about. For my main entree i had the Southwest bowl- delicious! Great flavors, generous portion and nice presentation. My friend got the district salad with salmon and she was very happy with her choice too. I'd definitely come back again for the jalapeño margarita and to try something else on the menu. \nTip-you can take the Downtowner to and from here!",

  "text": "This is the worst delivery experience I've ever had. I was a delivery driver for another Domino's for 5 years during college, so I know that things can get hectic, but this was ridiculous. Ordered online at 11:00pm, tracker said it would be delivered in 25-35 minutes. At 12:00am, the pizza had still not arrived so I called the store. They said mine was the next one out the door and should be there in a few minutes, because I live about 1 mile away from the store. At 1:00am, still no pizza. I call again and they said the driver left with my order and another order 30 minutes ago, and instead of driving to my house first, which was 1 MILE AWAY, he went to the other house first which was further away, and gave them their pizza AND MY PIZZA. They offered to make a new one and send it out, but I didn't want to wait up until 3 in the morning, so I said no thanks. They offered a free pizza on my next order, but that doesn't do anything to help me right now because it too late to order from anywhere else. This is why Uber Eats and other forms of food delivery will end up crushing stores like this. So to whoever runs this store, seriously, congratulations. You've just won the award for worst store in the franchise.",

  "text": "My family and I made a quick trip to New Orleans to take the kids to a Saints game and soak up some culture. I was disappointed that Camellia Grill's line was out the door.  Even though it's not the same since Katrina and Marvin passing, I still wanted my kids to see my old stomping ground. \n\nAnyway, this place was open and ready to seat us. I did a quick yelp & the stars indicated that it was a go. It was a Sunday and were told that they were only serving brunch which was a dealbreaker for me. Another waitress quickly corrected the situation & gave us the lunch menu. Our party of seven was seated on the balcony which is always a treat. \n\nNow to the food: The food was amazing! I had the chicken Cordon Bleu. It was panned to perfection & covered in an amazing cream sauce!  I let others sample and everybody agreed that it was delicious. My son had the chicken Parmesan (he did not share but he's a picky eater and scarfed it down), my other kid order from the brunch menu.. maybe eggs with crabcakes.. it disappeared too fast to actually see it . There were also couple of sausage/beef burgers at the table.  \n\nBut the highlight (for us adults) was the $5 bloody Marys. They were deliciously spicy with extra horseradish. They could have used some extra garnishes but the bloody Mary itself couldn't have been better.\n\nAll in all it was a great experience and the lunch menu is definitely a good value!",

There's plenty of seating inside which is refreshing and their staff is quick to greet customers. \n\nWe ordered a cap, a tea latte and two breakfast options. My tea latte was delicious and I'd definitely recommend it. Sean's cappuccino had latte art which we loved, but it tasted like a wet latte, and lacked micro foam outside of a very thin layer on top. \n\nIf you're picky about your cappuccino's, keep this in mind, as we ordered and paid for two and both came out the same. A little disappointing but we learned.\n\nBesides that, I can't really recommend the breakfast menu items even though everyone posted photos of them. The breakfast sandwich was super small and didn't have a ton of flavor. The breakfast burrito tasted like day-after leftovers that was in some gravy base. \n\nIn all, if you're looking for a quick place that has easy parking and lots of seating (plus charging stations for the win) this is a great option. But if you're looking to grab breakfast somewhere, I'd suggest coming here for the tea only.",

  "text": "We didn't really feel the love here. First off, we were greeted by an unenthusiastic waitress who was very cold and short with all of us. We started off by ordering 3 apps: the pierogies, crispy duck salad and cheese board. All of these items were delicious, however the portions of the cheese were completely underwhelming. Four people were suppose to share the cheese board. While the presentation was cute with the mouse shaped goat cheese, the portions of the individual cheeses seemed as if they were fit for a mouse! Each person basically got a crumb of cheese to taste. Moving on to the entrees, two of us ordered the scallops, one person ordered the lamb and another ordered the beef stroganoff. The scallops were good, but the best dish was the beef. We have dined all over the city and the country. The aspect about The Love that left us with the poorest taste in our mouth was the fact that this place charges $1 per person for water (still or sparkling). Mind you, it's not bottled still or sparkling, it's super filtered Philadelphia water. To top it off, there is no complimentary bread or rolls served. You must pay $5 for the Parker house rolls with chive butter, which, in my opinion, were not worthy of the price tag. Overall, the food was good, not great and we do not plan to recommend or return. At $200 per couple, these ancillary charges made us feel as though we were being nickeled and dimed.",

  "text": "Been there three times. First time wasn't so bad, second time took my son and his fiancé and my wife. We all ordered at the same time but we all are at different times. The kitchen couldn't get our food out together. On a $150 bill I was a little disappointed. Manager caught wind of our issue through FB and told us to come back and drop her name and they would take care of us so we did just that. \nThe food took 45 mins and was cold. The reason was they forgot we were there and bypassed our order to serve later customers. The poor waitress didn't get to find out I tip in $20 intervals meaning if the service is great I'll throw an extra twenty on top of the tip. I appreciate good hard working employees and waitressing isn't easy at all. Underrated really. \nThere's some guest that grace restaurants with eating at those establishments. \nIt's bad for business when you can't meet a basic standard. \nOur standard is high. This restaurant is not to par.\nSound \"Snooty\"? No. Basic expectations aren't Snooty and if a person considers it snooty then it shows how low the standard is for them. \nIt's ok to expect your food within 45 mins. Of ordering. It's ok to expect the food to all come out at same time. \nIt's a gamble to eat at Sams. Gamble my people won't take again.",

I ordered the chicken shawarma entree which came with 2 sides, along with vegetables and pita, friend ordered the beef shawarma and the other friend ordered the shawarma sandwich (all pictured). Only thing I noticed was the lack of tea options when there are countless teas served in the Middle East.

  "text": "If you need a cute place to grab a drink and some food at the bar this is the place. It's very small for the kind of restaurant/bar it is so it's not ideal for large groups but a small group of 2-4 can be seated at one of their few tables. This also isn't a great place for people with any kind of hearing issues because it got quite loud on a Friday night when I stopped in with my mom after a movie. \n\nIf it's just two of you (or you're solo) this is probably a great spot to have a conversation with someone you know well over some very interesting menu items. My mom loved her \"Bee Charmer\" cocktail with lavender-infused gin, honey, and a few other ingredients. She liked it so much she asked the bartender for the recipe but the key ingredient, the gin, takes two days to soak in lavender before it's drained and ready to be used. \n\nThey have a decent beer selection but nothing particularly impressive. They have a few local brews from the area but this place is definitely known for its inventive cocktails.\n\nWe'll be back to try their famous burger but our appetizers of fried pickles (thick but crisp and fresh) and an adult version of pigs in blanket were tasty and worth ordering again although I liked the pickles more. Our visit was cut short for outside reasons but I would recommend this place for close friends, established couples or a couple of family members. It's moderately to expensively priced but something to try out for yourself if you're looking for something a little different.",

Not only was the salmon in small supply, it tasted like over-cooked frozen salmon rather than smoked salmon as advertised (definitely not a deal with the $12.00 price tag that comes along with it). Even though the eggs, potatoes, and other fixings of the dish tasted great, the core aspect of the dish was severely lacking - especially compared to the other items ordered at the restaurant. I was able to use hot sauce to mask the flavor of the fish. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocation: (Not a factor in the rating)\n\nPrep & Pastry is a very nice and aesthetic looking restaurant.

  "text": "Kyoto represents that slice of Japanese cuisine which features misoshiru soup, sashimi, sushi & maki rolls, don buri (rice bowls), udon, bento, tonkatsu (a favorite), and a staggering number of appetizers (from gomae (a wilted spinach salad with sesame) to beef tataki to tako yaki (grilled Osaka-style octopus balls festooned with paper-thin bonito flakes).\n\nWhat it offers it does very well, and the hunnybunny and I have visited numerous times (and done take-away even more) because it's very near to us. Their fare is satisfying and presented straightforwardly. Perhaps a touch pricey, but we don't walk away feeling cheated.\n\nWhat I really like to do is start here and halfway through head across the street to Kabuki, which offers similar fare with a different take on the presentation. It's the best part of a soy sauce pub crawl :-) and makes for an interesting date night!",

We get here at 3:51PM, our reservations are wrong and now we have to wait but there is \"a rush\" on our rooms. Meanwhile, we go pick up the rest of our party from the airport and eventually receive a call at 5:41PM informing us our rooms are ready.\n2. We return to the hotel and let them know we are here and ready to be checked in but Deb from North Carolina is very snappy and refuses to hand us our ID cards and credit cards that we politely handed to her. She even once put here finger up to shh us when we had questions. Her demeanor was very standoff-ish and even somewhat disrespectful and demeaning. But we pushed passed it being exhausted and annoyed.\n\n3. We get to our rooms..... no wash cloths, refrigerator broken, moldy pizza, sticky nightstands, blocked view by banana leaf trees, dirty washcloths, dirty floors......ect. \n\nManagement attempted to remedy the issues by providing $50 credit but at this point, $50 is a joke. \n\n4. We're told we will be moved to rooms with a better view and cleaned properly but at the time we were out having brunch but told upon our arrival to call the front desk and let them know who we are, our room number, and that we're ready to be moved. When we returned and called, we were to led that the manager we spoke with was in a meeting and would return our call in about 30 minutes. In the meantime, I had to call a friend to explain to housekeeping that we were moving and how it would be more sensible for her to clean the room once we were moved since none of us were proficient in Spanish. \n\n5. To be continued because we are still under 24-hrs at this resort :-(",

I went for brunch on the second day they were open with a bunch of omnivore friends- all had a great experience!! Of course they are still working out some kinks as they're flooded with business and brand new, but the food was amazing and the atmosphere peaceful. I got the loaded B&G (biscuits and gravy) with tofu scramble and loved every bite- I didn't think that anyone could beat my homemade tofu scramble, but this was pretty close. I also had some of the eggs Benedict and roasted potatoes and really enjoyed that. The wait time was a bit long, but the price was definitely right. I will be back many times in the future.

The church has a clean design with a brick exterior and some stunning peaceful areas thanks to a garden and skylight corridor. The main sanctuary features an upper level and gorgeous stained glass windows that allow the natural light to flood in to the stage. The sanctuary is fairly large which explains why the ICC would choose this location. Note that they also offer ample parking. I can't speak for the church services but it did appear that they offer five services during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

I am sorry that I suggested this restaurant and will not be returning.  There are so many other really great restaurants in Nola. Very disappointed.",

Even though it took us past closing time (we didn't actually intend to get a vehicle that night) Neil didn't seem to mind. \nAbsolute professional in every way including follow up call/text.  Perhaps most importantly of all, they were just fine working with an insurance payoff that hadn't arrived when it was expected... \ngreat old fashioned business ethic here.

We decided to come in the early afternoon to have some drinks and food before the Lady Gaga concert on a recent Friday.  Upon arriving, since we were early, it was pretty easy to get a table outside but the place got pretty packed around 6pm with fellow concert goers and the after work happy hour crowd.\n\nCocktails off their menu are very creative and sound tasty, but two cocktails can set you back about $30.  There is a weekday happy hour for apps and the pretzel bites off that menu were a bit of a disappointment.  They tasted like clumps of bread with large salt chunks on them.  It was served with a cherry mustard, which was an odd combo.  I ended up also having a quesadilla off the menu and it was dried out and felt as if it was prepared earlier in the day and just sat all day under a heat lamp.  The pricing of the food was also not indicative of the quality and overpriced in my opinion.  \n\nIt was nice seeing this location finally fill up with another tenant and the overall atmosphere is really nice and spacious, but I feel as if their food quality needs to improve if they want to charge the prices they do.",

(Reasons for 2 stars.) \n\nHowever, the staff isn't that friendly: I had purchased three clusters of snow crab, drove the min and a half home to my house, and put them into the pot to cook for lunch. When I pulled them out of the pot, they stank of Ammonia / bleachy smell. I looked it up, everything I found said they were bad. I called the store and after be transferred from staff member to staff member, one finally told me to just come back for a refund. I asked if I needed to bring them back - ( that I totally would..it had only been a matter of 25 mins between buying and finding them rotten.) - and she told me, \"no, just come back with your receipt\".  So, I went in, only to be talked down too like I was (A.) lying. and (B.) like I was dumb for not bringing them back. \nI told the woman working customer service (not the one I spoke to on the phone.) that's I'd be happy to go get them and come back. I just wanted my $30 back.\nFinally got a refund after 15 mins., and some eye rolls and huffing and puffing from the lady working. \nI told them twice they need to pull the snow crab off the shelf, because they may make someone ill. \nCame back the next day to find the same snow crab there. \n\nThis afternoon I was eating some of their tomato basil soup you can get when you walk right into the store on the Starbucks side. \nHalfway through I found plastic in the soup, (picture attached.) \nI'm not even going to bother calling, because frankly, they probably won't do anything about it since they left the rotten snow crab on the shelf. And, I really don't think the $4.99 back is worth the attitude and 15 min ordeal. \n\nI recommend only buying fruits and veggies.",

Gab a quick drink and some thing to eat . Nothing special. Later went to the bar at 11:30 pm for some drinks . Was told that the bar is closing. What on a Saturday night. I was able to order drinks to take to the room. Stay open longer.",

You're not only ruining the night for other diners but the poor servers who only make money if they can turn the tables (I was a server years ago & it's very frustrating!) The food was super yummy ((great meatballs) but our waiter was the standout! We were bummed but he cheered us up. Thank you Giorgio for sending us over. You saved my sisters birthday dinner. Giorgio's is still my favorite but this was a close second!",

  "text": "Craving some BBQ I stopped at this establishment for take out.  I ordered the pulled pork without the bread.  Two sides where baked beans​ and the mac n'cheese.  \nThe pork was so tender and went nicely with the sweeter version of there  BBQ sauce.  I would say you get a little over a cup of pulled pork.\nThe baked beans themselves were just as I like them.  Not overly mushy but, tasty just the same.\nThe mac-n-cheese was to me nothing really special.  \nOverall I would come back and try different menu items.  Probably​ this time dine in.  Then​ when I get an​ uncomfortable looking at a  bag with too much grease on it.  I would not frown--as you must​ already know about me presentation is the king.

  "text": "Sam has become our go to spot, I only wish we'd found it sooner. We almost always can grab a seat at the bar, and the bartenders are always super friendly and attentive. Especially Monica, she's great and always recognizes us and says hi when we come in. She even remembers what beers were on tap last time we were in and can point out new ones to us. We get the county line wings every time...the sauce is some sort of combo of maybe bleu cheese and hot sauce and something else, and they're crispy,  or soggy like other places. The pizza is great too, we usually get the short rib or the upside down. Atmosphere is great for happy hours and dinner. We've been for an Eagles game before and there wasn't much of a crowd, which we prefer. We have yet to try their brunch or visit on a Wednesday night when there is live music, but hope to soon!  There's also a lot of regulars here, which shows you what kind of place this is. There's even an older gentleman who you can sometimes find at the bar doodling people he sees.",

  "text": "Vientiane Cafe - oh I love you dearly. Not only do you always provide an affordable meal that all seem to enjoy - you are consistent, every dish is made to order, and OMG can you accommodate all food preferences!\n\n\nThis visit is bitter-sweet, as I am departing the Philadelphia area for a new career opportunity.\n\nWhile I know I will be back from time-to-time, as I do have family in the area, I still can't just pop on over to one of my favorites when I need a good friend's couch to sit on. Because of all realistic measures, that is exactly what Vientiane is - a good friend's couch that you can come hang out in a laid back and chilled BYOB atmosphere.\n\n\nIt's that friend that makes you that big bowl of comfort food to help you celebrate the highs or to crush to lows... and for all of the amazing experiences I have had here - I thank you! I thank you for making eating out and being social a possibility for a gal who has multiple food allergies, is a bit of a food snob, and living on a budget. You are amazing and I will continue to spread the word that all of Philadelphia needs to come check out Vientiane, if they have not already!\n\n\nThis evening, we were seated and handed the revamp menu - which, is visually much more appealing. It is also helpful that this menu consists of GF (gluten-free) codes so I know what is and is not safe for me.\n\n\nI ordered a good classic for a table share - Lao Porridge (jow-piek) or congee. It is a smooth and comforting bowl of heaven - not too many more ways to explain it.  It is a subtle dish with simple flavors meant to heal. Good thing I planned on sharing and that I ordered the large because the entire table went nuts over it. P.S I order it with the soft tofu rather than fried - it is just a preference, but I think it makes a world of difference.\n\n\nThen, despite having a huge list of things I wanted to try (aka the casserole, Laab, any of their fried rice dishes, Banh-Xeo, a dessert, and more.....) I had to go out with the first dish I ever ordered.......\n\n\nDrum roll please..... the King Soup - or as I like to describe it as a Pho with coconut milk and much more spice! We all know I love coconut, love a creamy dish, and we LOVE spice - so win was always written all over this dish! Oh, and did I mention that they can make it gluten-free, vegan and it comes in a GIANT bowl for under 15!?\n\n\nA friend of mine did order the new dish, Bamboo Stew (gang-naw-mai) which is bamboo shoots mixed with pumpkin and mushrooms (very earthy) and served with their famous sticky rice. Note, while this dish is not marked gluten-free, I am sure that if you ask, they are able to modify it for us gluten-free folks! \n\n\nIn conclusion, it has been real Vientiane Cafe and I will certainly be back to visit! In the meantime, keep making some more awesome additions to your menu and oh, if any of my readers try the other dishes on my wish list, PLEASE SEND ME REVIEWS!\n\n\nUntil next time.\n\n\nOh, and check out all my other reviews of Vientiane Cafe below:\nhttp://gf-flamingo.blogspot.com/",

Liveminds goes above and beyond anything similar. It was comparable to being on a movie set. The experience was all immersive and each and every little detail was carefully thought out. From the decor to the sound effects- I was blown away! \n\nWe chose to do Treasure of Pacari. We had a small group (4)  of varying ages and everyone had a blast. This specific room felt challenging but also doable (that just right level of difficulty). \n\nEach second we spent inside made us feel like we were indeed exploring ancient ruins in search for the item! \n\nIf you are looking for a fun birthday plan or something new to do on a Friday night in the Nashville or Franklin area, I highly recommend Liveminds! I can't wait to go back and try one of the other rooms. Thank you for an awesome experience!",

There are few dilemmas as great, and as meaningful.\n\nI guess it goes without saying that pizza tastes much better when eating it right from the kitchen; delivery is foodie insult we inflict when we are lazy and hungry. Parkallen pizza is still very good when delivered, but in-house it was sublime! It has the most tasty crust I've long tasted in a pizza. The contributions of each ingredient (we shared a half Hawaiian and half meat-lover) could be noticed and appreciated.\n\nThe hunnybunny's place is near-by, enough so that we've eaten in and picked up pie for transport home. More than once it's been an open question whether we can survive the seductive pizza smell filling the car or should we just pull over and dig in. You've been warned :-)",

Everything from the service, to the food, to the atmosphere is amazing!  The flatbread was to die for, the chicken was tender and juicy and the girls live the pancakes and sides (we live the bacon!).  Oh and I can't forget the cocktails.. my favorite is the Tijuana Social!",

For starters I had to put my own powdered sugar on the beignets which I've never had to do and I eat beignets at least once a year when I'm in town.  Their beignets were a little fluffier than other places but I've had much better.  I'll only come here again if it's the only way to see family, otherwise I'll stick with Cafe du Monde.",

  "text": "This was without a question, one of the best sales and delivery experience I have ever received in my life. Below I will explain why I say that and how it came to be.  What I want everyone who reads this review to understand is a few simple strategies. 1) Know what you want before you go to a RV dealership; 2) Do your due diligence on choosing Make, Model, Options and the Fair Price you will pay; 3) Order the coach so you have time to sell your own if possible; 4) Don't be in a rush; 5) Have all your communication in writing and if something is missing, take responsibility that you did not prepare prior to your commitment.  \nAll the above is what I did.  Why, because I read every blog I can find on the subject, watch every YouTube™ video I could and listen to folks who have been RVing for decades. Every single part of my requests to Tampa RV were fulfilled prior to me even setting foot in the dealership. My sales consultant, Stephen Weaver, communication with me consistently throughout the ordering process (three months).  Everyone from the General Manager to the PDI manager called me prior to delivery.  Even the dealer sent me an email after I took delivery.  \nFolks, every aspect of my sale to delivery exceeded my expectation.  Thanks to the entire staff of Tampa RV for working so closely with me.  My hopes are everyone does their research and preparation prior to even thinking about the purchase of an RV from any dealership.  Bravo to all involved.  See my addition comments below for more information.\nThis not my first purchase of an RV/Coach.  Prior to every transaction, I do a level of due diligence that most people can't or are simply not willing to do. In the past I have been asked to speak on the subject at national conventions, pod casts, YouTube™ reviews including my own and my personal blog on the RV Industry.  My goal is to be a advocate for clients to have a seamless and transparent transition with most RV dealers in the United States. I am called the \"RV Advocate\".\nOn to my review. When I finally choose my brand (AirStream), model (Interstate Grand Tour) and option package (Tommy Bahama) it was time to choose my dealership.  Since I had purchased an AirStream Trailer prior, I had gone through this process before.  It seems my prior dealer did not communicate some critical facts to me on my potential new purchase, so we parted ways as friends. My money, so my choice. I knew every single Airstream dealer is a five-state radius.  I had visited most of them. I was referred to Tampa RV (A member of the RVone Group) by a trusted Airstream friend. Tampa RV's reviews were not stellar to say the least, but I studied them very closely.  It became clear to me the issues, not only with Tampa RV, all RV dealerships I dealt with was \"professional communication\" on both the client and the dealers side.  I created a process in writing to leave \"no stone un-turn\" and the result was OUTSTANDING.",

I had asked for an additional portion of herbed mayonaise that accompanied my Cuban sandwich, upon examination of the check, I found a $1 charge for a table spoon of mayo. Unbeliebvable. I said something to the manager who did nothing but say \"that's how it is.\"\nDon't be lured by the interesting exterior......this place is not worth your time or money and the management is completely tone deaf on customer perception of value; $8 for a 10oz glass of common IPA, $18 for lack luster fish tacos plus mayo for $1. There are much better options in that town or accross the river.",

There was a decent overflow of people waiting and I anticipated a much longer wait time than what we experienced which was about 20 minutes. This gave us time to engage in some observation of the clientele as well as the delicious breakfast items being pushed out by the kitchen. \n\nI loved the decor, clean, modern and welcoming! \nThe breakfast menu can satisfy from savory to sweet. My friend and I shared a cinnamon roll before our main dish arrived. She had the eggs Benedict and I had a wonderful has. The food was seasoned really well, came out hot, and was ample in size for our post yoga consumption, I had to take some of my hash home. \n\nOverall I am for sure a fan of this place and look forward to dining on the patio when the weather is a bit warmer! \n\nMy only criticism is for a refill of coffee they charge you .75 cents.  I don't know enough about the quality of coffee they serve but I can't imagine it's so extraordinary that you'll need to charge customers extra for a refill. Was just a tad put off by this!",

We were gonna accept it since the place was packed and you had to fight for a place to eat here. But then a miracle happened and a larger booth opened up. We already gotten out food but the waitress was really nice and let us move since it was still in her zone. No biggie. But then the service was not up to par. She only bought us one set of silverware. I figured she just put the one down to go and get 5 more. Nope. So we had to ask for plates and more silverware. She brings us the other half of our order and says she'll come back with the plates and silverware. Brings me my drink. By this time we almost done eating. No napkins. Ended up stealing a batch from the bar. No silverware. No plates. Finally she brings plates and silverware. But she only bought 4 silverware sets/napkins and 5 plates. We have a party of 6. You do the math. Then she disappears for the rest of our meal. We don't see her again. We ended up having to hunt her down to ask for our check. Also note that before all this we were almost given someone else's order. The people delivering it totally looked lost. \n\nThis place is still running around with its head cut off. I noticed that there is an entire area in the back that they closed. Then you have people hoarding tables while their brats run around to play games. If they are not actively order a continuous food/drink I think they are done. Maybe give em a hint by giving them the check. Just saying. \n\nAlso, if you parked in the garage they only have pay Stations on the first and 6th Floor. That's makes a whole lotta sense. People can either go down to the first floor pay for parking and then go back upstairs to whatever floor they parked on. That's not enough elevators for all that foot traffic. Or you can pay for parking before leaving the 6th floor where people are lined up to buy cards for the games and the foot traffic from the elevators. So now you adding to the foot traffic as well.

We test drove the vehicle, loved it and without ANY hassle or annoying haggling that you normally experience at dealerships, Harry had us in our new truck and out the door in no time.

  "text": "Ordered the chicken finger salad and a side of fries as takeout. It was ready in less than 15 mins and was directly across the street from the courtyard Marriott. The salad was good size. It has a House sauce on the chicken, which wasn't too bad, but a little spicy for my taste. The worst part of the salad was the croutons, which were greasy. I would get the salad again without the croutons. It came with a homemade ranch which I loved.",

Desserts were homemade with whipped cream made from scratch. Outstanding!  Cappuccino, iced Viennese coffee all winners. Service was superb. \nPlenty of parking. Cheerily and tastefully decorated for the holidays. Very comfortable seating. Serves beer and wine, too. Portions are so generous, everyone in our party of 6 took home leftovers. \nAll around winner.",

When I called back to ask if they could resend the order and I would give them the incorrect orders back, she yelled and stated that chicken chow mein DOES NOT include noodles, only lo mein does. I'm not Chinese, but I'm pretty sure that \"chow mein\" translates to \"fried noodles.\" I would recommend never ordering from this restaurant if you want a correct order.. or chow mein WITH noodles. They said the only way they would correct the order was if we brought it back to them.. which doesn't make sense because we ordered delivery and they messed up.

We have a three year old and a 20 month old.  When we came in, we were politely informed by three separate people in the space of 60 seconds that our kiddie 2 seater wagon was not allowed in the museum.  In case we didn't hear it the first two times in the space of ten seconds.  Even though I was trying to get my kids unbundled and out of the wagon so I could get my husband to return it to the car.\nThat's fine.  I understand the concern.  But what got me was the woman who was standing 8 feet away from me as we were waiting for him to return complaining to the security guard in a very audible voice about how she couldn't understand WHY anyone would bring a wagon instead of a stroller.  And how she wanted to make sure we got rid of it.  And why kids would need a wagon anyway?  And on and on.  \n\nIncredibly rude.  I followed the rules.  I put up no argument.  And you're still going to be snide?\n\n The museum is nice.  The kids area was nice.  The trains were cool. I sincerely hope they do well and spread understanding and better knowledge of Native American culture.   But I'm not coming back.",

When I booked the room it was for 2 people and their \"bay breeze package\" but when I got here I was told the reservation was only for 1 person. This resulted in an additional charge of over $50 to add my daughter back onto the package. Since it was my first time at the hotel and it was their error, I asked if there was a comp- 1 front desk person and 2 supervisors later I was able to get 1 free drink at the bar for a house brand drink. Really? All that work for a $4 glass of wine? When my daughter's cold got worse and then she couldn't use the additional service I just paid for, neither the hotel or the spa would work with us to rebook the service, issue a gift certificate or anything else. The room was ok, nothing special. The hot tub and pool were ok, but creepy later in the evening due to poor lighting and minimal staff.

  "text": "After a big lunch, we decided to swing by District Donuts and give the donuts here a try. Being in the middle of the afternoon, there wasn't a long line, and getting seating inside wasn't too hard either. The vibe is pretty relaxed, with a spacious feel, some industrial finishes, and spacious booths, bar seating, and some outdoor spots as well if you want to sit down. Most of the attention was focused on the donuts, but as the name suggests, they also serve sandwiches and coffee here - so a little bit of everything for everyone. We ended up sticking with donuts, trying out the chocolate glaze, spicy maple praline, and cookies and cream.\n\nHow'd it shake out? To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed given the hype that I had seen on here (and other places on the Internet). The donuts are very much on the thicker and denser side, and outside of the maple praline, I didn't think the frosting really stood out relative to other donuts I have had. I do have a soft spot in my heart (and belly) for maple donuts, which explains why I liked that the best flavor-wise - but it also didn't have any hint of spiciness at all, which makes me wonder why the description even bothered. The chocolate glazed donut was very average to me, and the cookies and cream was also pretty generic...there was only a small sprinkling of cookies on top.\n\nOverall, the donuts are different from what you'd pick up at a Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' Donuts, but it didn't measure up to the uniqueness (and tastiness) of other donut-centric shops that I have been to. I would like to come back and try the sandwiches, which looked tasty, but from a donut standpoint, I came away full but a bit disappointed relative to expectations.",

  "text": "My girlfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican and saw that this place had really great Google reviews. Our GPS seemed to have a really hard time finding it. When we finally did find it, we realized it was attached to the Bayside Inn Hotel on US19. We almost didn't go inside as we drove around the building and noticed that the hotel seemed to house less than savory folk. We were starving though, and just figured we'd go inside to take a look. We were instantly pleased with the service we received upon entering. The waitress was very pleasant and the establishment was clean. We ordered the house margaritas, which were delicious. We ordered the Vallarta fajitas for 2, which was a combination meat fajita platter. It arrived fast, was seasoned perfectly, and actually probably could have served 3-4 people. We spent $44 for 4 margaritas and the $23.99 fajita platter, which we felt was fair. I believe we now have a new favorite Mexican spot. It's a shame it's attached to the hotel, and isn't easily identifiable. It deserves its own building. We will be back. Thanks for the great food and service!",

I was offered help and samples of their different brews immediately upon entering. The guy who helped me was very knowledgeable about how the beers were brewed and what went into each batch.\n\nI ended up buying a custom 6-pack of three of their beers: Tripel Horse, Belgian Freeze, and Oatmeal Milk Stout. All the brews were very smooth and had no lingering after taste like Heineken, bleh.\n\nI'm not a beer lover (I only love vodka), but the River Horse brews are TASTY, creamy, and rich. It's nice to savor my drink instead of drinking to get drunk. I definitely need to get my air fryer so I can enjoy more River Horse brews with some fish n chips!\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with their product and I'm happy that a local, family run NJ brewery is doing very well!",

  "text": "St. Louis is always little slow on food trends, but I was super excited to hear poke was finally starting to arrive!\n\nThis place has been on my radar even before it opened, thank you social media. My spouse and I checked out PokeDoke for dinner one night. Parking was pretty difficult to find, but it's to be expected as this restaurant is located in CWE.\n\nI was having trouble figuring out which of the three sizes to choose. Small, regular, or large. I decided to go with the small which came with two scoops of protein. I had two scoops of the salmon with a base of white rice. I went with the medium poke sauce, but I think I'm going to go with the spicy next time. Toppings: mango, seaweed salad, masago, green onion, friend onion, and wasabi, all topped with a drizzle of wasabi mayo.\n\nI'm not sure I can say it's the best poke I've ever had in my life, but it sure was tasty. The salmon was pretty good, I liked the poke sauce that was used. The toppings went really well with the meat and the rice. I really just see poke as a deconstructed sushi roll, which I already love. I was really surprised as to how full I was at the end of the meal. Though I chose the smallest size, I was pretty stuffed. If I had chosen the regular size, I would've been very uncomfortable.\n\nI thought prices were fair. A small bowl is $10, while a sushi burrito from Blk Mkt Eats was $9 or $10. Not a big difference.",

They hung plastic and put down drop-cloths, and since they had to work over three days, the plastic had to be taken down and then put back in place every single day, so we could use our front door. They were always cheerful, polite, and terribly pleasant. The ceiling looked as good as new when they were done. The outside work involved repointing and repairing and recoating the stucco.

Order was correct and just as good as dining in. The location is sketchy, but I say this is hands down the best Indian food in Tucson. The staff/owners are super friendly and very accommodating.

I have to say the macarons here are better than la bonne bouchee I can eat more than one macaron here without having a belly ache. Usually when I am working on my second macaron at la bonne bouchee, my belly is hurting, thinking I'm just consuming too much sweets lol. My nephew had a cake made here which was the artwork was amazing!! The kids in the family killed all the fondant. I wasn't a fan of the cake, it was too sweet for my liking and that's just the cake itself with no fondant. I'm up to try their other pastries next time!",

Get it! Won't regret it!.\n\nFood... got the prime burger (per serve recs) was good, the meat was juicy and tasty! Nothing to die for, but a good solid burger.

You can be in and out in 40 minutes if you know what you want fairly quick. Very nice portions and they will cater to the level of spicy you prefer (1 thru 4 I believe). Go with a 2 if you want some spice, but not enough to distract you from your meal.\nMy favorite dish currently is the Vegetarian Pad Thai. Tons of colorful veggies and tofu to boot. I'm drooling just thinking about it now. I find the Drunken Noodles to be a bit on the oily side, so I don't typically order this one there, even though I it is one of my go to dishes for thai food. \nThey are closed Mondays. Chicken Satay special for app. on Tues. and Thursdays only. BYO as well.",

I got almost a dozen quotes within a 15 miles radius and Experimac was the only one that cost under $70, provided both the glass and LCD replacement, and didn't require an appointment.\n\nI decided to bring my phone in at lunch and pick it up in the afternoon. I had never been before, but when I went in, the store was very clean, well organized and pleasant to be in! Justin said he'd get started on my phone right away so I decided to wait for it. It was repaired in about 20 minutes and they even threw in a glass protector screen for free.\n\nTheir products come with warranties and are clearly high quality. The people at the store are pleasant and helpful! If you find a lower price for the same repair service, I have a feeling they'd be willing to match it.\n\nSo glad I got my phone fixed instead of paying an exorbitant amount for a replacement!",

I tasted some sweetness, which I found unusual for popcorn chicken. Definitely could have done without.\n\nWontons in spicy chili oil: Flavorful with a good spicy kick. They actually give you a decent amount considering it is an appetizer. I'd recommend if you like spicy!\n\nPig stomach and mustard green soup: I've actually never had the soup prior to my visit here, but was up to try something new. It has a pickled/sour taste from the mustard greens,the pig stomach has a slightly chewy texture, and there is a white peppery taste in the broth. I was actually surprised that I liked the soup.\n\nBeef chow fun: The noodles were a little too al dente for my liking and I think it could have used a little more soy sauce or flavoring.\n\nOverall, reasonably priced food, good variety, and food is pretty decent. Very casual ambiance and only had to wait a few minutes for a party of two. Next time i'm in Reno, i'd probably return.\n\nThere's a Yelp deal- 10% off your bill of $45+ and the restaurant also has an app (101 Taiwanese) which sometimes has coupons, but when I went I didn't find any current coupons.",

My wife is pregnant and she can't drink(the only reason she beat me in trivia Pursuit). They have popcorn you can buy there(cheddar and cheddar and Carmel mix). You can earn rewards for visiting there. I paid with a card and everything was easy and receipt was sent to my phone. \n\nFood***You can order from cluster truck they deliver to the parking lot. 1st time ordering you get 10% off Cluster truck has a ton of food options. And the food is Fantastic. You order from an app and they accept Apple Pay too. The reason I focus on the food is because good beer is good beer, but having food too is rare. They also have a stage area for small concerts. I will go back!! Oh and the bathroom has to be one of the cleanest public bathrooms I've used.(just saying)",

I recommend grabbing a latte and a baked good to munch on while you wait. \n\nI've had few dishes I haven't loved.  I normally find it hard to narrow down the options, I normally ask the wait staff bc there always seems to be a few dishes that rise above the others. The sorghum bacon is always pretty impressive and a crowd pleaser and I've definitely ordered a few different versions of the Dutch baby. Happy brunching!",

  "text": "The husband had a hankering for Asian food so we decided to check out this new Thai restaurant based on the reviews. We were not disappointed. We started of with their pork & shrimp dumplings. They looked more like Shu mai which was different than what we expected but very delicious. They have 4 spice levels; mild, medium, hot, & Thai hot. They are not kidding around with how spicy their food is. Normally I order the Pad Thai the first time I visit a Thai restaurant but decided to try the spicier Garlic Beef at their medium spice level. It was delicious & perfectly spicy. The hubby got the Panang curry chicken, medium spice, & it was delicious & perfectly spiced too. The portion sizes were just right. We finished off our meal with their sweet, sticky rice with mango. OMG, it was the best I've ever had! They use the black rice & it was warm & drizzled with hot sweetened, condensed milk. The mango was perfectly ripe & there was more than 2-3 slices. We will definitely go back. The hubby wants to try something hot.\nAttention Vegans - they have a separate menu of dishes just for you!",

They were not bad but not one of my favorites either. They were still good. The table over got nachos that looked delicious. I also think if a place has a clean bathroom, their kitchen is usually clean too. This place is spotless. I also was impressed to see the bartenders cleaning bottles and the bar in their down time.

  "text": "Bailey's Chocolate Bar moved upstairs and Dave Bailey transformed this space into an entirely new experience. Having recently been to New Orleans, I can tell you the decor is very similar to the trendy & chic little restaurants in the French Quarter. I cannot wait till spring to enjoy the outside dining. \n\nMy dining partner and I started off sharing, a Lump Crab Cake, Blackened Shrimp and a Cornmeal Waffle. My favorite was the Blackened Shrimp that came with a Cucumber Ranch. I tried it, it was cool and refreshing, but I ate my shrimp without it. The spicy flavor, was reminiscent of the cajun seasoning I experienced in NOLA. My DP, favored the Crab Cake. It was topped with slices of grapefruit and avocado. Make sure you get a mixture of all three in every bite. It makes for an interesting combination on your palate. \n\nOur Cornmeal Waffle was a tad cold, so we sent it back. The second one was warm and served with a large scoop of soft whipped butter. I enjoyed the texture of the cornmeal and the taste, but would have preferred some other type of topping in addition to the butter. Perhaps, a little cup of syrup. After all, it is a waffle. \n\nWe went in different directions on our entrees so we could each sample each others. Being a fan of catfish, I choose the Crab Stuffed Missouri Catfish. It was served on a bed of poblano grits and topped with a garlic dressing. You can not go wrong with crab and catfish in the same dish. \nIt's amazing how the older I get, the more I am developing an appreciation for grits. These were some of the best I have had. \n\nThe DP went with the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp were the same as the Blackened Shrimp we enjoyed as an appetizer. She liked them. They were hard to photograph in a dimly light bar, so trust us when we say they tasted better then they photographed. \n\nBeing a bar diner, I was highly impressed with the comfort and style of the barstools. The back was low, giving good back support and they had armrest for extra comfort. Only thing lacking at the bar was hooks underneath for ladies to secure their purses and outlets to allow social media junkies to keep charged up. \n\nNathan was a great bar host and mixologist. He's a transplant from Tulsa and is adjusting to new city very well. Stop by and welcome him to STL. \n\nWill I return? - I hang out in Lafayette Square - so, YES!\n\nWhen: December 28, 2017\nWhy: It's new, hot and trendy. You should go, too.",

That time made so much longer by the fact that we were stuck forever doing drop offs in the French quarter. Those staying there who were lucky enough to jump off the bus and walk after sitting in traffic and not moving were luckier than those of us in the garden district. As the first ones picked up in the morning it would have been nice to not then be dropped off last. The tour at Laura was good, but the tour at Oak Alley was really lacking. And the bus exhaust was so bad during our drive that you could barely stand it. Not worth how much we paid and not worth an entire day/evening if you ask me.",

I have been here before multiple times for the same things, so I have never tried anything else on the menu, but I must say that TJ's is definitely worth it during discounted burger night. When I looked at the menu, I realized that there were many burgers that were previously offered that were taken off of the menu (like the TJ's house burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions which was my favorite), but there were new creations added aswell. The burgers were also priced differently, and discounted a little differently than they were before. I got the guacamole bacon burger, it was originally 13.99, but the discount brought it down to 7.75 (so not exactly half off, but close enough). Since their menu got redone, I don't think that the waitress knew exactly how the discounts worked, which is something that my financially aware family would like to know, but she was able to communicated that they were indeed discounted. Appetizers are half off, so there is no confusion with the pricing. I enjoyed my burger, and there was tons of bacon on it, but I'm not a huge guac fan. I'll come back this winter and have their steakhouse burger, which may have been a better choice.",

Normal baguette and nothing special.\n\nThe fried eggplant is served with a marinara sauce. I would have personally wanted more cheese in the eggplant and a thicker sauce, but this was not too bad. The presentation of the dish is also exquisite. The eggplant was served in a small fryer basket on top of a thick cutting board. The sauce was served in a creme brulee sort of cup and also on the same board. I probably won't order the fried eggplant again since I didn't love it, but my SO loved it a lot.\n\nThe gumbo has fantastic flavor. The portion is quite small, but the flavors make up for it. It's served with a bit of white rice.\n\nThe shrimp and grits is fantastic. Jumbo shrimp was slightly overcooked, but shrimp tastes good regardless. The grits were cooked perfectly with a sauce and served with sausage. This is a delicious Southern staple.\n\nThe portions are okay and prices are not too bad for food in Louisiana.",

  "text": "Ate here last night and boy was it good! The staff was great, very informative and knowledgeable of the menu. I had the seasonal chicken- it's buttermilk fried chicken and it was served with grits and collards. Having lived in the south, I have a very strong opinion about grits, chicken, and collards and what I was served at The Love is some of the best I've ever had. My mom got the salmon poke and she said it was amazing as well. \n\nThe decor is also great, the cork ceilings absorb some of the noise and it feels very cozy yet chic. \n\nOnly reason it's missing a star is because the dessert menu was a little meh - as someone who's lactose intolerant I couldn't eat 3/5 of what was on the menu.",

Trust me - you will love this place. \n\nThink vintage oil cans and crystal decanters with silver trays and copper tagines. Add to the mix a variety of artisanal gin, rye and Japanese whiskey served over an upbeat but chill background music (Like ARE & BE on Spotify).\n\nI ordered the Ugni blanc with some baba ganoush and the autumn root vegetable tagine. Homemade bread was amazing and everything was delicious. I'll let the photo do the talking.\n\nI'll be back!",

Clearly damaged from beginning. Shoes did have some wear. But as it's used shoes some have more wear than others. When I returned the employee said no we can't take those back in that condition. They are in the condition I bought them. So I asked for a manager. Who was rude and said nope sorry we are taking them back. The hostile attitude of the employees and arrogance is none matched by any store I have ever been too. There was no customer service. I was denied to use their return policy even though I had not had the shoes 24 hours. They said call the main office if I don't like it. This is a Christian company. Which mAkes it even more shocking. They sell used shoes! They are not in new condition. Yet then say they are not in return condition. SHOP AT YOUR OWN RISK! Do not count on their return policy. They are not honest.",

Don't shy away at lunch if you are dressed casually! \n\nThe dill bread to start was delicious and interesting since dill is fairly underused at restaurants. I started with the House Salad that was a bit of a flop, but helped me meet my vegetable requirements. There was plenty of greens with onions and manchego, but the delicious dressing wasn't mixed in properly. The salad tasted like it had been drenched in salt too. My husband started with the Crab Cake and that was delicious! It had nice pieces of crab and a definite creole flavor with the seasoning. \n\nI ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was delicious. The shrimp were good and the sauce and grits were tasty. The flavors of this dish were spot on. My husband ordered the Etouffee Pasta and that was probably the best food of our entire trip. The flavor of this dish was outstanding. Despite liking my meal I would definitely order this next time. \n\nOur waiter was friendly and professional.

For some reason I was losing a lot of eyebrow hair for some time.  I had my proceedure with Annie Morris, she was recommended.  She took her time explained the procedure, was very gentle, and accommodated my schedule I went in on a Sunday.  My eyebrows make me look years younger I love them.  I will definitely be back Annie.  I love the freedom of being able to run out the door without any make up and still feel pretty.  That gift is priceless.",

  "text": "Exquisite. We went here for the second time this fall since they started the chef's menu. We'd been to Vetri a few times in the past, when it was a fabulous, traditional Italian restaurant and it was great then. This is food, wine and service taken to a new level. On both occasions we had the wine pairing and it was spot on perfect with the courses. We started both times with a palate teaser from the chef which promised the joys of what was to come. Unlike most multi course chef's offerings (such as Alinea in Chicago) Vetri actually gives you a choice of dishes within a limited range of beautifully prepared courses. We opted to have the chef choose for us both times so that we could taste what he thought was interesting and so that we could share each other's plates. When I say that this rivals the best restaurants that I've ever been to, it is not an exaggeration. The blend of flavors in each course and plate was magnificent.\nIn addition, we had the same wait person both times and he paid meticulous attention to us and was friendly and understated. Such a pleasure. Finally, one could actually have a lovely conversation here. It had a pleasant low level vibe without intruding on conversation. For those of us who hate loud restaurants, it was heaven. Vetri is pricey, so it's not an everyday, casual kind of place. But you get what you pay for.",

We were sitting for 25 minutes before the waiter came to get drink orders. I had to ask the hostess to light a fire under him. Not that the young man wasn't nice. He just was poorly trained and slow. Looking around it seemed as if all the servers were away from the tables and out of the dining room most of the time. Back in the kitchen perhaps? Certainly not attending to our needs. At this price point I expect more and have gotten better service almost anywhere else in Philly. \nThe food was just OK. My husband and I had the prime rib. I've had it elsewhere in Philly for a lot less and it's been comparable flavor wise. My friend had salmon which, again, was OK. The sides were OK. Nothing special. When it came time for coffee it was not presented with cream or sugar and when the sugar came, there was no teaspoon with which to stir it into the coffee. Don't know what the rave reviews are all about because we won't be back.",

My dad was in the mood for chicken and I remembered this place, so I headed over.\n\nI was here on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. I'm talking line out the door, people inside waiting on their order packed. I took this as a good sign, so I hopped in line and got ready to order at the window. I got the 14 piece chicken combo which comes with fries and a salad. It was a little over $10 which was perfect because there's a $10 minimum on cards. After you order they give you a number and you sit and wait. On this day the wait was about 15 minutes, because of the crowd, but that wasn't a problem. When my number was called I got my food and I was on my way.\n\nThe chicken itself is tasty and really generous. There was an even mix of wings and legs and I enjoyed it. The fries weren't anything spectacular and the salad was just lettuce, so next time I might skip the combo and get the 14 piece for $8 deal. While Golden Wings isn't on the level of Popeyes, you can't beat the price and the food is enjoyable. I'll be back.",

Fish and chips looked like larger versions of fish nuggets and the lamb, although cooked well, was really underwhelming. It was listed as having \"a variety of toppings\" but in reality, one had half a piece of bacon, the other some melted and congealed cheese, and the last had absolutely nothing. I had to dip them in ketchup to get any flavor other than meat. For that, I would've just gotten a cheeseburger. Would come back here for a drink but not for food.",

  "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE\nI had out of town guests and took them to Bareburger. We were a party of 4. When we entered, we were behind a party of 2. The party of 2 was immediately seated at a 4-person booth, while there were multiple tables for 2 available. Host told us they were just clearing another booth (and pointed to it) and said we would be seated there shortly. In the meantime a party of 5 came in after us. It took 10 minutes to clear the table and then another hostess came up to the original host to ask who was waiting for a table. He told her our party of 4 and a party of 5. She proceeded to seat the party of 5 at the booth, adding a chair to the end of the table. There were no other tables, let alone booths, available for 4. When we told her we were supposed to be seated first, she said there was no other place for the party of 5 and it was just logical to seat them there!?? In what world is that logical?  We walked out and will not go back. Went down the block to Barra Rossa, seated within 5 minutes, had excellent service!\n\nAnother annoyance at Bareburger, while we were waiting to not be seated, a hostess came and shouted at the several groups of people waiting to MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE RESTAURANT SO PEOPLE CAN GET THROUGH! Has management never heard of customer service training?",

  "text": "It is always nice to have a local restaurant real close to where you work! This place is in a little shopping mall which would give you a little pause on if this place is going to be the pizza restaurant experience you are looking for. However, do not be fooled, this place is a legit pizza place! Their calzones are by far the best for local faire and their \"The Krewe\" cheese sticks are the whole reason why I would walk through that door.\n\nThe food is good, the price is pretty cheap and it definitely beats out your local fast food pizza delivery spots. If you find yourself in Belle Chasse, come check out this funky little spot. This is the most convenient place to get your Rotolo's on!",

  "text": "This a review of the kids haircut. Both my little guys needed a haircut and this place was recommended by a friend of ours. \n\nIf you're not familiar with this place, it is a sports oriented haircut establishment. A TV showing ESPN or a sporting event. Sports magazines on the rack for your reading pleasure. The process of getting a haircut is to check in on the tablet. Type in your number if you've already registered and wait. You can also request a certain stylist if you wanted.\n\nWe didn't have to wait long and there is about 16 chairs you can sit on. The stylist was very professional and made our kids feel comfortable. There were lollipops to help them pass the time too. Since it was our first time there, they upgraded the cut to the MVP.  Your kids will get a shampoo , dry, and a massage if needed. They also have hair color which my kids wanted. Blue for one and red for the other.\n\nThe haircut was good. My kids were happy and the staff was great. We will be back again.  \n\nThe Kids MVP cut is 23 dollars.",

  "text": "Another brunch gem for Midtown! We went here to try a local place before we headed home and we were not disappointed! We started out with the White Trash Hash- holy smokes. They're basically cheesy potatoes but way better. I had the Pretzel Pancakes for my meal and they were the perfect flavor. They were drizzled with dulce de leche and served with a side of white chocolate mousse and they were so good! I also had a side of Texas toast (hello carb day). Ask for the coconut jam with it... UNREAL. My boyfriend had the biscuits with chorizo gravy and he said they were really good. He also asked for a hot chocolate. Our server (I can't remember what her name was but we were in the room that looks out onto the patio on Sunday 12/17) went to the back to check if they had it and it turns out she made it by heating up milk and melting chocolate.. they didn't have packets so she went above and beyond. Incredible food, incredible service, and definitely one of our new regular spots when we visit!",

Thin lite crust with great flavor and char. Good draft beer list with a large list of bottles. Service was just ok this could have been because we sat at the pizza oven bar.

Not what I would typically expect from a burger spot, but hey- it works! Perhaps what sets this spot apart from other burger spots in the city. \n\nI think Burger Study also finally hit their stride. When they first opened there wasn't a ton of consistency among their dishes, but I recently returned and was pleasantly surprised. Burgers were cooked to perfection and topped with only the highest  quality ingredients. My fiancé pointed out that this was the best bacon he had ever had on a burger! \n\nA great alternative to some of the other chains along GA Street and a must try for any out of towners.",

We had it towed to InTown Auto Care for a second opinion.  A transmission isn't cheap, the Winstar ran fine otherwise, and Intown Auto Care was recommended by friends.  The new owners Suzanne & Mike took great care of us. The diagnosis was done quickly and a replacement transmission was ordered. \n\nUnfortunately the first transmission ordered didn't meet their standards. We received a call from Mike. He stated he didn't like the looks of the transmission and ordered another one. He apologized for the delay. We were happy he was looking out for us ! Just as happy to have an Enterprise rent a car arranged with their help.\n\nThe Winstar is running great, good for another 14 years!",

Sushi was good for the most part but I hate when they put a lot of rice. So when I got salmon nigiri, I pick off a little bit of the rice. I had 3 tiny bits of rice on my plate and the server rudely stated \"next time finish your rice, ok?\"   I eat sushi at least once a week, this was the first time a server has commented on a little bit of rice left on the plate.  Inside one of the salmon was some black stringy substance so I did not eat that piece and he didn't like the fact I left one piece of nigiri on the plate as well. Price is on the high side. They didn't not refill my drink at all.  The sushi was pretty good though beside having too much rice on the nigiri.",

So when you go inside you pick the size of your salad and then either you can get bread or a banana but this time I ordered the bread and I must say they're bread rolls are really good but the little tub of butter they give you is not even enough to butter the whole bread so when she charged me I was a little taken back surprised to say the least.

I will recommend to go to a diner for more quality food. I got the 8th st egg Benedict and it was came with two very small pieces of eggs on English muffin plus a weird green salad and bland meshed potato on the side. Boy, their cook couldn't even poach eggs. The Egg was hard and solid inside, not runny at all. The ham was dark and over cooked. Too much acidity in their bearaise. Overall worst egg Benedict I ve ever had. They can't even do it better than a causal diner. My husband ordered the chicken and waffle. The chicken was in pale color and has no flavor. KFC chicken is much better than that! The waffle has the same pale color as the chicken with minimum flavor and very soggy. I think it's easy to surpass that with just your home waffle maker. Overall, save your money and go to a diner instead!!",

The pizzas are brick oven fired to perfection, neither soggy or dry, and always what you're in the mood for because you pick all the ingredients. \n\nIf you're like me, you have big ideas about ingredient combinations but hold back because adding toppings is criminally expensive at most pizza joints. \n\nNot so at MOD. Everything is one price, so you can afford to get all gourmet and creative. And if your creation, like mine, involves a dozen or more ingredients, you'll find they add the ingredients judiciously instead of overloading the pizza to the point of soggy crust. \n\nI also appreciate the online ordering.",

  "text": "DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! First off they were hours behind. My daughters ipad had a small crack on her screen. It was still fully functional. No issues whatsoever. The technician, Naseeb, came out and was watching YouTube videos on how to perform an ipad repair. He then stacked 5 heavy books on top of it and stated to leave it. I did not get a chance to look at his work. He stated to leave the books on for 24 hours. The next day the screen was lifting and halfway hanging off. The company then sent another technician out and he stated the first technician took my frame with the screen. Which they are not supposed to do. No one could get ahold of him. Now my screen is only half lit. I was told when that happens there is no fixing it. I have reached out to this company. No response. They said they are going to have management call. No response. I have no issues getting my lawyer involved. Do not waste your time or money with this company. They will send you around in circles. My daughter us devastated that she lost all of her contents on her ipad. These technicians are NOT certified. If they are, they are definitely not tested to make sure they really know what they are doing. Save yourself the headache and find another company!!!",

Ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwhich; chicken was pale white, soggy with oil, definitely not fried and drained well, and might have even been slightly undercooked. The side green salad was just leaves, no dressing, no veggies, bland and neglected. The sandwich had absolutely no flavor, no taste, undercooked chicken, and strong pickles. Overall just a terrible experience and it took 25min to get the check back. Never coming back; you're better off going to a local diner or fast food restaurant for higher quality/edible food.",

Our original plan was to visit Biscuit Love, but the line was long and Milk and Honey had only a short wait. \n\nThe sausage and pepper omelette was a perfect size for a hungry guy and was cooked perfectly. Fresh peppers and delicious breakfast sausage.  My girlfriend had scrambled eggs, caramelized onions and arugula on a biscuit which looked amazing. She said it was quite good!  \n\n\nUpdate: upon further review of their wood fired pizza oven we decided to return for dinner. Excellent choice. The braised short rib and gnocchi was phenomenal and the pie was a perfect Neapolitan style margherita. Would definitely come back again and I recommend you try it! \n\nPro Tip: save room for their cookies",

Well I decided to order takeout and sit at the bar during happy hour while I wait for my food. The happy hour beers are a good value, I got a nice cheap beer for $2.20 from a very friendly bartender/server. As for the burger I ordered the 'Fire Quacker' it's made of duck, added to pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapenos on a brioche bun. This 'burger' was juicy, tender and bursting with flavor. No it's not your traditional burger but if you are adventurous you should take a shot. I also ordered the onion rings, nothing to really speak of here. If they're 'homemade' they should rethink the recipe as the taste is bland and overly breaded.",

When I saw my FB showing a photo of Napoleon from J'aime, I can't wait to give it a try. \n\nWe went J'aime on Christmas Eve but they ran out of Napoleon so we ordered Chouquette which is very surprising good. The cream of Chouquette is very light without heavy sweet and last time I had such silky smooth cream with good/right puff is from beard papa(Japanese bakery).  \n\nSo, I decided to come back today in order to get in line for Napoleon. Like Chouquette, Napoleon also has a very velvet moisture cream and because J'aime doesn't glazed sugar or fondant on the top layer, it won't too sweet which I can even eat a whole without coffee or tea. We also ordered Quiché and I like pie crust of Quiché at J'aime is thinner than Le Pain Quotidien.",

This place goes on and on and on. Lots of tour buses and tour groups but it didn't feel to crowded.  This is a money making machine so you'll see bars every 100 ft, gift shops and they have things designed for you to spend.  We took 15 min boat ride which was kinda funny and it let us rest our legs - it was $10.50.  We walked over to the Grand Ole Opry and went by a christmas gift store - again designed to make you spend money, when we got to the Opry - it was $26 for a 45 min tour - we decided that was too much - we would have paid $5 for a peek!!.  This was a great spot to get in some steps, look at the beautiful gardens inside the hotel and check off the bucket list.  We did not stay on site so have no idea what the rooms are like.",

Unfortunately due to its size gets too busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. You have to pick a good time or prepare to stand. Raised prices a few years ago. Taking it from a really good bargain to a moderate one. \n\nMy first bad experience was today otherwise I would rate it higher. 8:30 AM on a Monday in December and the restaurant was almost empty because I was by myself I was not allowed to sit at one of the eight open tables. I was not interested in sitting at the counter and there were plenty of seats and no one at the door. That's just bad business. I left embarrassed because I happen to be alone this time.",

I thought it would be the perfect place for us to get our fix!\n\nWe arrived around 11 am on a Friday morning, trying to beat the afternoon rush and were seated right away. Our server was great, explained the menu and what they're most known for, and immediately brought us over coffee, water, and OJ (the fresh squeezed juices here are amazing!). We were all craving something savory, although I've had the pancakes here in the past and as a brunch enthusiast, I can assure you they are some of the best in the city. \n\nI ended up ordering the Eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was rich and tasty but not too overwhelming and the eggs were poached to perfection! My friends thoroughly enjoyed their maple bacon and croissant sandwiches as well. Ants Pants has easily become one of my go-to brunch places: reasonably priced, wonderful service, amazing food and coffee...what else do you need?!",

My husband and I did a couples massage for the first time on our trip to New Orleans .  I was able to book  over the phone and wasn't asked to give credit card information over the phone which I liked \n\nArrival\n\nBoth therapists were there when we arrived both were friendly and nice. We were offered a glass of red or white wine  and asked what genre of music we preferred.  They were already playing reggae which we found suitable. \n\nThe Massage\n\nWe were shown to a candle lit room and asked to undress and get under the sheets. The massage bed was really comfy and warm. Both therapist begin our massages with warm oil. They massaged from top to bottom. Very relaxing and the right amount of pressure. All the way from my finger tips to my toes. My husband fell asleep and was snoring (loud) but it did not disturb the tranquility of my massage. The price was right and the service was spectacular. Will see them again when I return in March.",

This spot would be ideal if you want to grab something on the go for lunch but you don't really care how good it taste. The steak itself is thinly cut and little or no seasoning on it. If you dine in they have complimentary tortilla chips but when I was there it wasn't refilled. It can get packed during lunch hours so if you're planning to dine in with more than four people, I suggest you come a bit early to grab some tables. Would I come back?

A live band was setting up and we had a front row view.\n\nOur server Philip was extremely friendly and went out of his way throughout the night.\n\nWe started with the fried pickles which were phenomenal. Fried pickles are one of my favorite appetizers in the world of appetizers and I have had many a fried pickle in my day. These were delicious! You can tell they were made in house with a deliciously seasoned batter. Go easy on the dipping sauce though...it's spicy!!\n\nI ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was delicious! So good. The mashed potatoes that came with it were a little spicy but still very tasty. The gravy that came on the chicken and potatoes was the best part of the entire meal. The only disappointing part of the meal were the green beans. I could tell they weren't fresh and my husband's meal came with fresh green beans. My only feedback would be to replace the green beans that come with this meal with fresh ones.\n\nMy husband had the smoked meatloaf and he loved it. It came with a mushroom gravy and he was in heaven.\n\nThe Pecan Skillet cake was highly recommended by our server and it did not disappoint. This was hands down the best dessert I have had in years. It was like a pecan pie with a cake with fresh ice cream in a cast iron skillet. It was amazing. It literally changed my life for the better and no other dessert will ever compare. I will continue to have dreams about that dessert until I have it again.\n\nWe will definitely be back next time we are in the area! We stayed for a couple of hours and watched the entire set performed by the band. It was a wonderful Friday night.",

I ordered a cortado and received something more similar to a latte -- espresso-milk ratio was too milk-heavy.  The space is nice, but was very smoky both upstairs and downstairs.

  "text": "Spiro's is a long-lasting, respected Greek establishment in St. Louis. From date nights to family gatherings, it suits many needs. \n\nMy review is a short one. I decided that I wanted a gyro. Having had Pita Plus during my last gyro craving, I wanted something new. To begin, the inside is beautiful and classy in a revived 70's feel. That is not a slam in any way. It feels upscale and older, more mature. Everyone was very friendly and from the interactions of the other customers, I suspected many of the people eating have been there before, if not multiple.\n\nWhile I ordered ahead, I ended up waiting a few minutes before the food arrived. After traveling back to work, I dug in. The fries were seasoned well; however, they were a little mushy. As for the gyro, the meat was a little overcooked (very often, once the meat is carved, it will go on a stove top for a little extra heat) and the Tzatziki sauce was very bland with the yogurt flavor dominating everything else, which was, possibly, the greatest disappointment. \n\nUltimately, it was a very confusing experience. Spiro's always seemed like an iconic Greek restaurant in St. Louis and the feel of the restaurant fit the image I had in my head before ever visiting, but a simple dish was missed in a big way. It could have been a \"one-off\" or could have been a sign of a classic restaurant not keeping up with the times. I cannot say which one - that will have to be decided for yourselves.",

  "text": "Below average pricey Thai restaurant with a full vegan menu.  \n\nVisited on 12/2/17 at 5PM.  I must have passed by this place a hundred times and never noticed it which is ludicrous because the sign on the outside of the building is absolutely enormous and they have a unique round entryway around the front door. It sits in a small strip mall next to a consignment store and a laundromat.  \n\nInside it's rather un-inspiring with plain tables and clutter.  It is one of those sketchy looking places where you want to order \"something safe\" if ya know what I mean. We were seated very quickly and service was fast and friendly.  $41.57 got us a seafood entree, a chicken satay appetizer, and a kid's meal. \n\nI got the $7.95 chicken satay appetizer which came with four chicken skewers, a bowl of peanut sauce, and a bowl of cucumber salad.  The cucumber salad was fantastic...chock full of fresh jalapenos and onions and fresh cucumbers.  The peanut sauce was a little bland but a very generous portion.  The chicken skewers were yellow, hard, dry, flavorless, and barely room temperature.  I am certain that they were cooked either yesterday or earlier today and re-heated.  For the price, I'd expect some freshly cooked chicken.  \n\nMy son got the $9.95 kid's chicken pineapple fried rice which came with apple juice and a spring roll.  I do not like paying ten dollars for a kid's meal at any restaurant but I will say their portion was enormous.  They give 3-4 times more than any child can possibly eat.  It was the best thing I tried tonight...hot and fresh and well seasoned. I found it unusual that it was smothered with fried onions which I wouldn't think is very kid friendly.  My advice would be to cut the portion in half and lower that price and nix the onions.   Also the meal was supposed to come with a dessert which they never brought out. \n\nI watched in horror as my husband's dish arrived.  He had the $20.95 \"seafood basil delight\" which the menu said had shrimp, calamari, mussels, and scallops stir fried with basil and onions and an herbal sauce.  What arrived was a plate full of green peppers, onions, calamari, shrimp, and mussels.  The scallops were missing and the green peppers were not on the menu description.  This is not the sort of place where I would order something like this but my husband is a brave man.  He said he'd give it a \"4 out of 10\" and that it was hot but bland.  \n\nThe prices here do not match the quality of the food.  Serving old chicken is absolutely unforgivable.  I would not go back.",

The service is awesome, really friendly and enthusiastic and completely welcoming to the swarms of tourists like us.\nThe shrimp appetizer was a bummer, just warm shrimp with old bay floating in a bowl of water.  The water was yucky and distilled the flavor, so these really should be served dry.\nThe fish and shrimp tacos were both really great and nice and full of seafood. Drink specials were good, and the sour/midori margarita was delicious.",

  "text": "I was really excited to try this place since it's the first place I've heard of that has boba, Thai rolled ice cream, and crepes. It's about a 15 minute drive from USF campus and the GPS doesn't take you to the exact location which is within a large shopping plaza next to Aldi's market. \n\nThere weren't that many flavors of boba besides the staple flavors. I opted to try was the galaxy tea which came in four flavors: Passionfruit, mango, strawberry, and lychee. It comes in a plastic light bulb cup and has basil seeds already included. The drink tasted similar to lemonade and was very sweet (most likely because I chose passion fruit). It was interesting to taste but I wouldn't order it again. The crepe menu has about 8 options you can choose from sweet or savory concoctions. I ordered the fruit crepe that had blueberries, strawberries, bananas, and kiwi. I was really disappointed that my crepe was cold when I got it and the filling was mediocre. The fruits were fresh but the crepe itself was chewy and bland so It wasn't enjoyable to eat. \n\nOverall, I feel like this place has potential if they were to improve the quality of the crepe and had a larger drink selection.",

  "text": "A colleague and I were in town on business and stayed at the attached hotel.  We stopped in here on two occasions during our stay.  The first experience was great.  We wanted a quick appetizer before meeting friends.  The BBQ nachos were delicious.  A decent-sized portion. Not too large and enough \"stuff\" to make your tastebuds happy. I also tried their in-house beer.  It was pretty good.  I was surprised.  Our bartender, Kevin, was very friendly.  Turns out he's also a damn fine musician too!  \n\nNow, our second experience was quite the letdown.  We popped in for lunch.  I tried the fried bologna sandwich.  I was intrigued by something new.  I shouldn't have been.  It was a bit too fried for me and on plain old bread.  I opted for American cheese, which looked plastic-y and didn't cover the entire sandwich.  I felt slightly ill afterward, perhaps from the grease?  My colleague had the brisket sandwich.  She said the flavor was okay but that it was super fatty.  She also didn't feel great afterward.  \n\nSo, maybe stop in for an appetizer and music, but then head out?  I was disappointed that lunch wasn't as positive of an experience as lunch. Whomp whomp.",

It's pretty close to the mall entrance near Cheesecake Factory, and it's a nice little space. No real place to sit and drink the bubble tea, but cute shop with a section with lots of Asian snacks. There's not as much variety of choice of tea here compared to other bubble tea places, but it's largely because they focus on using fresh fruit in their teas, and don't use powders.\n\nThe tea is definitely tasty, though a bit on the pricey side. My wife got a cold mango tea with sago, and I got a hot ginger milk tea. The mango tea was very refreshing and light, and the ginger milk tea was really great for a chilly day. It wasn't super hot, so I could drink it through a straw. I probably wouldn't have minded it being hotter, but it was delicious. I would totally get that again, or try another ginger tea...",

It's really close to campus, but there's no parking at night, traffic is really bad, and it is extremely overpriced. The apartments look nice at a glance but were built very badly and have a lot of technical issues like leaks and broken appliances. If you want a quiet place to live, this is not the place to be, students are constantly partying, running around yelling, throwing up everywhere, and setting off the entire building's fire alarms. The alarms go one for at least a half an hour and a lot of times its really late at night, the alarm is actually going off right now and that why I'm writing this review. Where every you decided to live, DO NOT choose the Summit, it might look pretty with pool, hot tub, and granite counter tops, but you'll regret it. I would just find a house near by for rent or if you really want to go with a student apartment go with the Highlands, its older and kinda beat up, but it is run a lot better and is a better place to live overall from what I've seen.",

I AM VERY VERY ALLERGIC TO CATS. I immediately started sneezing after a couple minutes in the store and then, while I was walking the aisles I saw it... a cute, fluffy, disapproving kitty. It gave me the evil eye and I decided it was time to go. \n\nThe staff on site were very friendly and chatty.",

  "text": "This is a pretty cool local bar. Went there on a Monday night, not a lot of people there at all. Bartender was good. We just had a few beers. They have a takeout beer section too. Highlights: 2 small size pool tables which were really nice. All the cues were pretty beat up though. They also had a shuffleboard table and dartboard. I didn't eat there, so I'm not sure how the food is. My experience was average. Since then, I've been here about 4 more times, pretty much only to play pool. It's a dive bar but the upstairs is pretty cool when it is open. (Usually after 7pm) They have another pool table up there too.\nUpdate- we come here all the time now, honestly, the experience is hit or miss depending on the the bartender. Most are cool and do a great job, but some are so terrible it makes me not want to come back.",

After buying at the other dealer I returned once to Glanzmann for service. Again they were totally professional and I had no problem with the service they performed. However the accommodations for those waiting for service are sadly lacking. The waiting room is glass-walled and with the sun pouring in 15 people sat there shading their eyes unable to work with their laptops or to see the television screen because of the glare. There was no coffee or even hot water available during the two hours I was there on a Monday morning. Reading material was limited to two copies of The Inquirer. There were no facilities or space for mothers who might have to bring their children with them. From now on when possible I will seek service at another dealer a half-hour further from my home.",

  "text": "Been coming here since I was a little girl and they have amazing Greek food. The food gets 5 stars, but service brings the overall rating down to a 3. A year ago I went in with my mom and we ordered a Greek salad for two. A waitress immediately interrupted my mother and I and asked us if we were sure we wanted the bigger salad because the two of us probably could not finish it. At first I was taken aback by such a comment as it is not the waitresses/waiters job to tell me what I should and should not order. However, it never happened before so I didn't make a big deal out of it. All was well, until I went back again with my mother yesterday. Like always, we ordered a Greek salad for two. I proceeded to continue with my order and as I was stating I wanted a chicken souvlaki, the waiter didn't even let me finish before he said well if you are going to order more food maybe you shouldn't get the bigger salad. It'll be too much for you two to finish. Okay, are you kidding me? Is this a rule in this place? A rule that says you need to tell customers how much food is enough? This isn't alcohol we're talking about, you can't cut me off of food. The salad is not even big when split between two people. It is disrespectful that the waiters and waitresses are even making suggestions like that. It is rude, and mind you I'm paying for a bigger salad rather than a small one. Larger bill=larger tip. Better service=better tip. Simple as that. If I get asked this one more time, I might be convinced that it is a rule to tell people how much food is enough in this place. \n\nP.S. some people enjoy leftovers.",

I made reservations for an early dinner so I was seated at a comfortable booth. \n\nMenu was steak centric for sure so I went with the Ribeye. I also indulge in calamari, raw oysters and a bottle of Groth Cab. Service was top notch and the experience was first class all the way. \n\nThe ribeye was spot on mid-rare. Calamari was the best I've had in Florida and the oysters (blue points) were as fresh as could be. \n\nAnd you know what else happened?  The GM, AGM and Executive Chef all stopped by the table to ensure everything was perfect. I felt like a Zagat critic!  \n\nNext time I'm in Tampa I'm making Timpano my first stop. \n\nApparently they treat everyone like a big shot there...",

We came here for brunch and ordered: fisherman omelet, hangover hash, and sombrero frittata. They overcooked the eggs as we wanted over-easy for the hangover hash, but the spicy siracha mayo complemented the dish full of sausages and potatoes to add a little flavor. Sombrero frittata didn't amaze me since it has avocados mixed into it and a side of toast that was a like biscotti. The dish was pretty bland and I was expecting avocado slices. Fisherman omelet was a nice portioned meal but a little seasoning would be great my friend asked if it had came with toast, the waiter said yes, but none was served.",

When we got inside we were immediately seated and were able to identify several menu items that looked really yummy  the prices were all pretty decent (a meal and a mimosa will run you about $20). When the food came out everything tasted great (the fries are AMAZING). And last but certainly not least, our server Dan was super attentive and helpful. Overall it's a nice option for a casual weekend brunch if you're not trying to do a boozy brunch but still want a little booze.",

Once inside if you close your eyes one would think they were in a major city in the US. Love the open kitchen. Beautiful inside and out. Now for the food. Kale salad with hazelnuts was fantastic. Even if you don't like kale you will love this. Next the octopus. Perfectly done and one of the best I have tasted. This next dish they hit it out of the park and should make it permanent on the menu. Pasta cups with red meat gravy aka bolognese sauce. It was so good and had a little spice to it. And last a table share of a pork shoulder that they crisped up which was fantastic. Believe it or not our friends made a reservation for this Wednesday so we can't wait to go back.

The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion. With that said, please note that this is a rather personal opinion and is based completely on the one issue.

The quiche is served room temperature, but mine was cold like it had been in a refrigerator. I asked to have it warmed up and it came back at about the same temperature. It was ok, but there is definitely better quiche to be had in StL. The arugula salad was entirely forgettable. I also ordered one biscuit with gravy on the side to try. The biscuit was a lot bigger than I was expecting. Neither the eggs in the quiche or the biscuit were very fluffy - they were both much denser than I would have expected.

  "text": "Worst experience ever. They charged us 3800 bucks for deposit while we provided the docs they asked for(proof of income). I live in LA and my bf lives there. I have a dog, which stays with me most of the time and I bring it with me to visit my bf, like probably once in two weeks, and the leasing office was trying so hard to make us pay the 1000 bucks for a dog deposit. They really made me feel like all they care about is money money and money. Of course we ignored it, and then they emailed us, threatened our roommates \"if you don't pay the dog deposit, you will be kicked out\". So we paid for it. And then I decided I'm just never gonna come to this community any more, so I asked my bf to take back the check( at that time I was visiting with my dog but I'll be back in 2 days), and the woman in the office said that \"you either signed the document or you gotta send the dog away RIGHT NOW\". almost forgot to mention that they are so good at asking for money but have not given us the garage keys or the other gym key since my bfs moved in for 1 month:)",

  "text": "I am not new to sushi restaurants. I have been to many, and have a definite idea of what good sushi is and what bad sushi is. This was BAD sushi. As a USF student, getting 10% off by showing my ID is very exciting. Unfortunately, I would have rather paid more elsewhere and received an edible dinner. \n\nThe first red flag was showing up at \"happy hour\" and there being only one other group inside the restaurant. The menu for happy hour sushi was also more expensive than their regular menu for the same items, which was confusing. Another red flag was that most of the rolls listed were marked with an asterisk as cooked...when there is only a handful of raw sushi options, you know your meal is going to be questionable. \n\nI started with the ginger salad, which was a laughable loose handful of iceberg lettuce, string cut carrots, and a swamping of dressing. I could have poured the leftover, watery dressing into a wine glass. I asked about their special, which I think was called \"Smokey\", because I am a fan of smoked raw salmon...the waiter cringed and recommended I try something else. I should have left after that. \n\nThe smoked salmon was listed as cooked, which also shocked me because anywhere else I go, restaurants cold-smoke their fish. It shouldn't be cooked at all, just flavored with smoke. After inquiring about the Salmon Lover's smoked roll, the waiter said that yes, it's cooked, but it has the texture of raw fish. Sounds fake, but okay...I ordered it, hoping I was misunderstanding him.\n\nThe rolls came out quickly, but the meal itself would have gone quicker had they just thrown it into the trash after making it rather than bring it to my table. The \"smoked\" salmon didn't taste smoky, and they had the texture of raw fish because it WAS raw--and beyond safe food temperatures! it didn't flake like cooked salmon and was slimy. It tasted spoiled. The tempura flakes inside the roll also had a disgusting, bitter taste that overpowered the entire roll. I didn't eat the rest of it, and hoped they'd take it off my bill. It was $12 for that monstrosity, and I was praying that I didn't get food poisoning from the few bites I risked. I told the waiter I didn't like it, and when he returned with my bill, the nasty roll remained but it appeared he had removed the cost of my $2 salad. Yippee.\n\nUltimately, the whole experience was absurd and a waste of time. I was there with two other friends, one of which who also eats raw sushi and didn't enjoy her experience either, and one who exclusively eats cooked rolls. She thought her food was good. \nIf your frame of reference of good sushi is cooked(?) or store-bought, this is your place.\nOtherwise, save your money and avoid food poisoning--STAY AWAY!\nI will never be coming back here.",

  "text": "Wow. What a great idea. I was stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for my \"twilight tour\" with the Navy so I am well acquainted with Poke in all its various forms (poke is fusion Hawaiian food and refers to bite-size chunks of raw, marinated fish - Ahi tuna is a favorite - or other seafood, which is tossed over rice and served with vegetables and umami-packed sauces). This place does a very good Florida version of that delicacy. Their scope is quite limited in that they only do tuna and salmon poke (come on, guys, try something exotic - like octopus, or  snapper, or albacore tuna), and their sauce is way too light to be authentic. But I am hoping as business grows, they will rise to the challenge. Just so you know, this business is located in what was once a drive-through coffee bar, so there is no seating. In fact, there's no parking - you drive up, place your order through the window, and they hand it  back to you from the window. And since their location is the intersection of Himes and Gandy, trying to enter their driveway during afternoon peak traffic hours can be challenging, to say the least. Overall, they have room for growth and improvement, but this is an excellent start, especially for south Tampa!",

On a recent visit, our server, Jill, confidently recommended the Avec les bons Vœux de la brasserie Dupont - she was right! I'll try to get back while they still have it. For snacks, we enjoyed the white bean spread and a cheese selection. The very attentive staff brought more bread as we worked through what was first served. On a more recent visit, the mushroom with Fontina toast was excellent, very simple, yet really satisfying. And may I say that NOT having a TV was an excellent decision by the owners.",

  "text": "To be honest I really struggle with this brewery. I love multiple levels of their establishment, but the beer is not one of them. And let's face it, it's a brewery. Isn't that kind of important? \n\nLet's start with the heart eyes emoji provoking assets. Their food is great. Their fried chicken sandwich melts in your mouth (I didn't order this but I always get a taste of my buddies palate ). Their bao buns were not the best I've ever had, but still tasty. I actually prefer mine more on the airy, fluffy side, but they choose to sear theirs so it's a little crispy on the outside. I'd also prefer. More crisp than fatty piece of belly inside but hey look who's being contradictory now (make up ya mind, Tone). Anyways, I was surprised at how much I loved the fried rice in my salmon taco. I actually enjoyed a few forkfuls on its own throughout the course. But even still, almost all of the portions are a little small for the price. Quality is important though here, and I feel they nail it. \n\nThe atmosphere is definitely another pro. If you don't like noise, go away. People are having fun and drinking merrily. It's gonna be loud. So talk a little louder, look at your guests when they speak, and laugh at the kids next to you trying to steal their dad's wings. I'm Italian. I'm loud. I love noise. It makes me feel at home. So the tremendously open layout of this building is much preferred over their cafe location. \n\nSo the con here. Guys. Whyyy are your saisons sour? No where else do I experience this, and saisons are my favorites. And guess what.. I hate sours. Don't get me wrong, I've had a few of their beers that I have really enjoyed, but overall I think this place is over hyped. My thought is they just try to get too eccentric, and just get a little nutty with their concoctions. Like I said, I don't hate it, but I rarely love it. I'll still keep going though. The atmosphere, food, and occasional slam dunk brew still reels me in.",

Sergio was our bartender he is a true gem to the hotel. The bar was busy but took the time to answer questions and not rush us. He recommend the catch of the day and the jalapeno burger. The food took a while well 45 minutes which was extremely long. Once the food arrived the burger was amazing but the fish was not good and that's giving it credit. The rice was cold and was sent back. The fish had no taste. The portion was VERY small. The manager Teresa came over and was extremely helpful she's a true asset to the Hyatt. She listen to our issues and handled it really professionally. We left the property to get the car from valet and encountered another issue that is when I met another manager Ajyey (so?) she walked me to the valet and took care of the issues.

Lets start with the counter. Two groups walked in at the same time and there was nobody at the counter. After a period of time the manager (from the cooking area) had to yell out to an employee that there were people up front that needed their orders taken. I then heard the manager say \"I'm not yelling at you\" to the person. After placing the order, the counter person handed my wife a number to be placed at the table for food delivery. The card with the number on it was covered in some sort of sauce or ketchup. (At least clean it first) We then went to the serve yourself soda and ketchup machine. The ketchup was empty and the soda machine nozzle must have been dirty as it sprayed inside and outside of the cup. Was there a napkin nearby to clean up? No, those containers were empty too. Lastly, my wife's grilled chicken sandwich was not completely cooked. The one good thing that happened was they replaced her sandwich with another (without an apology). So in conclusion, this is not an indictment of all Zaxby's, just this location and it's staff.",

The first day we dealt with Armando and Frank.  Both were great guys!  They were personable and very easy going.  We went over our options, talked some pricing and my wife and walked out with a good feeling about working with them.  Our initial plan was to go visit a few other dealers and see what else was out there, however, after sleeping on it for a night we were both in agreement that that was the best experience we have had at a dealer to date.  At home that night I shopped pricing and found that I was getting about the best deal available in the state.  I went in the next day and purchased the truck.  I worked with Derek to iron out all the details and Hector in finance to get my loan squared away.  Both were very personable, professional, and it was honestly the easiest car buying experience I have ever had.  I will be a customer here for the long haul as I really feel that buying a car can't get any better than going to Santa Barbara Toyota.  Thanks to everyone I really appreciate all the help and advice plus I'm loving my new truck!",

I've always had a decent experience, good margaritas and good food, the wait was never good but tolerable. \n\nWell tonight, 12/29/17, we asked for a table of 6, we were told 40 minutes wait time which was fine, we get it people probably had cabin fever and they were busy. We scurried to the bar area, congregated at the corner ordered drinks, even got a pitcher of margaritas. The bar servers were great. 70 minutes lates, we were finally seated. \n\nWe got our appetizers, they were great then we ordered our entrees. Three of us got fajitas, 2 out of 3 were cold. One of three that was hot. But the hot fajitas had such a tiny steak on it. 2 of us did not want to complain, we weren't there to get free food but eventually one of our friend did say something. Our server, Ashley, was great and she got the manager. He solved the situation by getting me a fajitas that was hotter, the way it's supposed to be. He brought out another steak for my friend. The food runner with the pink hair dropped off my hot fajitas but the literally dropped the plate of tortillas, sour cream and guacamole as if she was bothered by our complaint in front of my friend. The Diva in me wanted to snatch her hair and scold her for her behavior but in the real world I had to keep it cool. I was so angry that I lost my appetite. I don't expect to be worshipped, that's not what I wanted but a good customer service would have been great. As a frequent diner, that's all you want. Good food and hot meal with decent service. \n\nLook, I'm not here to get free crap, I literally eat out almost every single meal. I know what's it's like to deal with customer complaints, I respect everyone and do my best to fix the situation since I've had a job dealing with food and people at age 16. The food runner with the pink hair could have remedied the situation by acknowledging the situation and not taking things personally or even the manager could have tried to understand but none of that was done. I felt bad for Ashley, the server but she literally did her best and try to make things better. \n\nIt just sucks because I don't think I could ever get my friends to come back here again and I think I am done as well.",

I didn't appreciate the flippant response  but she was young so I'm guessing she hasn't had much experience and/or training on customer relations.  And I certainly don't expect a restaurant to do something like that, but what I DO expect is a restaurant to know how many reservations they can take at one time and to save tables...just some basic restaurant management.  To make matters worse, my entrée (ribs) were black/burnt and tough.  I had them once before and they were very good.  Perhaps they had an off night with less seasoned employees running the show?",

First it took a while for the bartender to take our drink order, which was understandable because she was busy taking another order, but why the assistant manager didn't even acknowledge us while standing directly in front of us blows my mind. The attitude the bartender had, however was not understandable. I mean every chance that she had to make a snarky remark, she took and not only to me, but to my husband and every other customer in there. I have never met a bartender or server who had more excuses for their poor service.  \n  When our food did arrive, I teasingly asked if they had \"gone out back to catch the chicken for our wings\" her reply was \" Well they have to be cooked. You don't want to eat raw chicken do you?\" No I thought, but I also know that chicken wings and chicken tenders (which we ordered) don't take 35-40 minutes to cook. What was really funny (well not) is that my chicken wings were overcooked and I mean, dry and dark. I did let her know and she took them off the bill, but honestly the attitude that she had throughout the meal was a complete turnoff.\n  I don't know if we'll return to this specific location again, but I know I can't let this bad experience ruin Bullys for us. We'll try again, but with doubts.",

  "text": "I've used ANCO for 28 years. Not often, thank goodness.\n\nBut they've always been reliable, trustworthy and knowledgeable.\n\nI called yesterday, December 1, kinda late in the afternoon. It wasn't an emergency, so I didn't need overnight or weekend service. But they said I could get service Saturday, which is today. Wowee!\n\nThe battery in my garage-door opener was depleted and making insipid yet piercing BEEPS. This is continual. It happened before -- in 2012.\n\nThis is IN THE GARAGE. I can hear the beeps in the house. You can only go so far with this situation without pulling a Jack Nicholson.\n\nIMO, you need the battery. It's there so you can use your garage door when the electricity's out. I went through this conversation in 2012 with Greg.\n\nToday, Greg came again.\n\nI got a call ~8 a.m. giving me an 11 a.m.-1 p.m. window. Very tight. Very good and very much appreciated.\n\nAnd Greg called after his previous appointment to say he was on his way.\n\nGreg arrived ~11:15 a.m., and we had the same conversation about the need for the battery. I opted to get a new battery . . . my luck being the electricity would go out tonight right when I want to go to the grocery.\n\nHe totally understood and proceeded to replace the battery.\n\nTHEN I mentioned how the two light bulbs quit working after a few ups and downs of the garage door. I'm thinking it's vibration that loosens them, and then they don't come on. And Greg confirmed that is the problem.\n\nGreg had tips on this conundrum. He asked me how tightly I tighten them. I said loosely. He said tighten them as tightly as you can. Wear a glove, in case the bulb breaks. THAT'S how tightly to screw in the bulbs.\n\nHe took out my bulbs, filed them (to get back down to the core), used a screwdriver in the socket -- yes, electricity was turned off -- to reduce debris and then blew into the sockets to get rid of the detritus.\n\nBINGO!!!!! Both lights worked.\n\nGreg knows of what he speaks.\n\nI got a new battery. I got big tips from Greg re the lightbulbs. $199. Check this one off the list, and I don't have to pull a Jack Nicholson.",

After reviewing their background with the BBB, (which was an A+ rating) I contacted them for a basic 4 point inspection. Wilmer was the gentleman who came out and he was amazing (and very personable)!  Not only did he complete the inspection, but he offered very helpful hints that would be beneficial for lower insurance rates and help preserve the longevity of home.

Probably the most hipster restaurant I've been to in Reno, but I would not recommend this place if you're trying to have an intimate date night. The music in the restaurant is super loud. \n\nService: After my boyfriend and I were seated, it took the waiter at least 15 minutes to get us water. The food took a long time to come out and our main dishes came out at different times. After finishing dinner, we asked for the check and I think the waiters completely forgot about us because we had to wait another 10-15 minutes. I would expect restaurants to want to turn tables over quickly, but for some reason service was super slow. For the poor customer service and overall dining experience, three stars.\n\nFood: Tried the crab croquet. Pretty tasty, but I don't think it warrants the high price tag. Three crab croquets for $13 is a little steep.\n\nAlso had the spicy miso ramen ($16) and the wicked fried rice with duck cracklings ($14). I'd say the ramen here is probably better than other places I've been to in Reno, but nearly double the price. The broth wasn't super rich, but presentation and little vegetables were nice. The wicked fried rice was pretty good. The cracklings definitely add texture and the duck on top was cooked well.",

  "text": "Tuna Bar is a new sushi digs in Old City, a relatively upscale neighborhood in a city flooded with mediocre sushi restaurants. I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.\n\nThe ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.\n\nWe started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. \n\nFor our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.\n\n6/5",

I had a 2 chips in my windshield, 1 small but the other was rather big and when I took it to Safelite they told me there was absolutely no way it could be repaired and I would have to replace my entire windshield.  Shawn repaired my windshield that I was told would be impossible and it was about 4x cheaper than my quote from Safelite.  Very prompt on responding to my request and setting up the appointment and the whole repair took about 30 minutes or so.  Great business, trust all the 5 star reviews!",

  "text": "Ate here a couple of weeks before Christmas after receiving a gift card.  I've been here a couple of times before.  Free pie Wednesday is good.  There's just a lot of restaurant choices so I don't eat here often.  We happened to be here on all you can eat chicken tenders night.  I didn't know they had that.  Anyway, my wife, son and I all got the tenders.  My wife ordered the regular, my son got chipotle and I requested the Nashville hot.  My son loved the taste of the chipotle.  My Nashville hot was okay, I just didn't like how it was soaked in sauce.  It made the breading soggy.  I should have asked for it on the side, but I didn't expect it to be like that.  I prefer Nashville hot to be more of a seasoning in the breading and not a wet sauce poured over the tenders.  I ate most of it, but some was just too soggy so I scrapped off the breading and ate the meat.  If you like very hot then O'Charley's Nashville hot really won't satisfy you.  It was spicy and had some heat but not really hot.  If you're familiar with Buffalo Wild Wings the heat level of O'Charley's \"hot\" would be in the range of BWW's Caribbean jerk.  The all you can eat tenders meal is a great deal.  With all of their specials throughout the week, and great coupons they mail, O'Charley's is a really good deal.  Good rolls and butter, good pie and a good deal.",

It was super cute and festive during the holiday season and tons of cute little knick knacks like Christmas signs, pillows, and dolls.  We bought a blueberry pie to take for my in laws when we were there.  That pie was DELICIOUS!  I LOVE blueberry pies generally and really enjoyed how fresh and berry-licious that pie was.  I think this farm would be a fun place to go berry picking in the summer (I went berry picking in central Jersey with friends back during summer 2012).  I would definitely visit again if I happened to be in that area.  Their pies are delish, their service was very nice, and it's just very quintessentially Jersey.",

Love the layout of the rooms, the desk with the privacy partition that allows for some late night work without bothering the family or simply a comfortable spot to work during the day.\n\nColor scheme is calming, peaceful. Everything is planned out from the faucets to the drapes to be a \"paring\" of the style. The end result is a well coordinated modern theme with plenty of visual interest from the lobby all the way to the commode.\n\nNow, to top it off, Lauren is just about the most friendly, accommodating person there who treats you like a \"guest\" rather than a \"customer\". Her voice actually \"smiles\" on the phone.\n\nWhether I am coming to Tampa on business or to visit my daughter at USF, I stay here. Thank you for being such a great host to my travels.",

We had coffee, fruit tea, a salmon Benedict, and the bananas foster pancakes. Everything was superb! My husband couldn't stop talking about the coffee, and I always enjoy southern fruit tea. The salmon Benedict was comparable to any good Benedict dish, but the real star of the show was the pancakes. I'm neither a pancake person nor a banana person but we ordered this on the recommendation of a friend. I am so glad we did! The serving was huge, and I think just splitting the pancakes alone between two people would have been plenty. They were delicious! The best specialty pancakes I've ever had, for sure.

  "text": "My hubby and I have lived out in the Spanish Springs area for over 20 years and started coming in when this one was opened. We used to hang on the Smokin' side as we felt more comfortable over there, the smaller vibe and the bartenders were always great.\n\nBut we started coming to the non side in the last year or so more often. We used to try over there on and off through the years but it always had kind of a strange vibe and it had such a warehouse feeling to it. We like to sit at the bar and feel welcome and comfortable, we enjoy gambling and having some food & drinks. We've finally found it started having a nicer vibe when David and Jo started working behind the bar during the evening hours which is when we frequent the place. We always get great, friendly and fast service. And we no longer feel out of place, we feel welcome. My hubby and I have gone to many, many bars through the years on our travels and local and we love meeting and getting to know our bartenders, many have become friends to us near and far. It definitely makes the difference to want to hang out and enjoy the gambling. It takes special personalities to be good bartenders and keep your business up, not just anyone can do it. We will actually choose not to go to bars on certain nights based on who is working. We don't want to spend our hard earned money if we're not going to enjoy ourselves.",

We then shared the Lamb sliders which were very tasty and not gamey at all. Lamb usually scares me. Three Muses did it right on these tasty guys. We also shared the Fist tacos which were also very delicious. They also offered a variety of fun cocktails. There was live music playing and the decor was very eye catching.

The wine list is extensive the cocktails we ordered were great and amazing aromatic. \n\nUnfortunately, the hospitality really hampered the entire experience. We arrived early for our late evening reservation that was not honored- we weren't seated until 20 minutes past our reserved time. This happens sometimes, but in this instance the hostesses seemed confused and began to seat us twice before they finally seemed to get it together. Meanwhile, loitering around the hostess station, is who I can only assume was the FOH manager based on his attire. He did not acknowledge what was going on. We were one of two parties waiting, and the dining room was maybe 3/4 full. \n\nOnce seated, in the back next to the kitchen and a large party, we were not met with a waitress until another ten minutes had passed. She seemed flustered- maybe they were understaffed for the evening? The food came out quickly and was on point. There was no manager presence whatsoever during our visit.\n\nI was very much looking forward to this experience, but even the strong culinary team will not be enough for me to return during future stays.",

I pray they operate a massive recycling center in the back because no free water (bottles only), combined with styrofoam everything, nearly guarantees them a spot in trash hell. Dumplings are very good but small and somewhat pricey - just 6 set me back $8. I've been told they are labor intensive to make but this seems extreme. There's no way i could bring my teens here and get them full for under $100. Again didn't stay to eat but seemed clean.",

I live in Philly, where there are lots of Asian options - but I go out of my way for Asian Chef. The people that work there are awesome and super friendly, the fried foods are hot and crispy, and on top of that the prices are ridiculously reasonable. You can get a huge lunch for $7! Where else is that possible, I don't even know. Seriously, if I lived around here this would be my go to. People of Mount Laurel - don't take this for granted!!",

For two large cheesesteaks, a large fry, and two sodas it was about $22! It's a pretty small menu, but I'm sure the other items are delicious as well. It seemed like they had a really nice beer selection as well. There is also a parking lot out back so you don't have to pay for meter parking on Rising Sun Ave. We'll definitely go back \n\nUpdate 12/30/17: We went back again and it just keeps getting better! Tried the BBQ wings and they were so amazing! Best wings we've ever had. Awesome prices too: 2 large cheesesteaks, 6 wings, fries, and a soda-$25!",

We were supposed to be  back by 9, but didn't get back till after 9:45.  Try finding dinner after 10 on Christmas eve.  The tour guide on our bus was a total waste.

Not only was the mattress we bought hundreds of $$ cheaper than what we would've paid anywhere else, but it is the most amazing mattress we've ever slept on.

They also have awesome subs, but tonight i order a ham & cheese (only) and when we got our food everyone elses food was good but mine. My sandwich had lettuce and mayo on it (which i didn't want on it) and on one half of it, it has little pieces of ham like someone ate it and put on the bread, and one or two pieces on it. The other half had 2 big pieces of ham on it. And it wasn't even cooked. So i called them and told them about it.When the delievery guy got here he said to toss the old one, i showed it to him and he said that wasn't even cooked. And the owner is there and he will take it back to show him. So they send me out another one and this time the ham was really sliced thin like for pizza and not much on it and alot of cheese, burnt. Bread burnt. I won't be ordering anything from them anymore. They lost my busy. Since they moved to 16th Street they went down. We pay alot of money each time we order from there EVERY WEEKEND!!!!!",

We got there and were greeted by a mumbling cashier. I had to have her repeat what she was saying with each new statement. I ordered a small boneless wing combo plain, with sauce on the side. My hubby ordered a medium traditional with the sauce on the side. All the tables, except for a small one were filthy. A guy halfway bussed one table, so we sat at the only clean small table near thr front window. It was miserably cold!  We waited 17 minutes for our order, which was packed to go, even though we said we were dining in.  We, however, were happy to take it to go because it was miserable to sit there and shiver. Once we got home, (less than 2 miles away) the fries were barely warm. My husband's wings were partly covered with sauce (since when does plain mean cover some with sauce, if you want.  My boneless wings also had some covered and some plain. The fries have some fake barbecue tasting seasoning on them that ruins a perfectly good, partly warm French fry.

  "text": "Let's get this out of the way right now: it's pronounced \"Ah-vuh\" NOT \"Ay-vuh\" a fact that distinguishes the restaurant from the young lady it is named after.  I have been to Ava plenty of times but never wrote a review prior to now...it's time to spread the love! \n\nMy first experience at Ava was during Creative Loafing's Restaurant Week Tampa Bay in 2015. Since then I've been to Ava several times, mostly for dinner with family and friends and sometimes for lunch. I've also visited Ava to pick up food as an UberEats delivery person.  \n\nHaving visited Ava several times, I am certain about a few loves: \n\n1. The ambiance. It's perfect -- lively yet romantic; trendy yet comfortable. Ava offers al fresco dining (covered outdoor seating) as well as a variety of table styles inside (from classy high tops to traditional table seating). Be sure to ask about the \"Secret Dining Room\" if you're in need of a reservation for at least 10 guests! \n\n2. The Casarecce al Pomodoro. I love to order this dish with extra ricotta and sometimes, if I'm feeling frisky, with the Nduja sausage (this is a spicy sausage which is different from the fennel sausage). \n\n3. The Ava House Salad. It's a bit on the pricy side at $8.00, but the ingredients (mixed greens, cucumber, radish, tomato, red onion tossed in a house Italian vinaigrette) offer the perfect explosion of flavors pre-entree.\n\n4. Joe Maddon. He is part owner of Ava and he is former manager of the Tampa Bay Rays...so duh, he is a love.\n\nAlso, for solo diners, Ava is one restaurant that has an incredibly welcoming bar that erases all of the unnecessary shame in dining alone. Trust me, I've done it time and time again.  :)",

My boyfriend and I went into this gas station for some beer and waited at the counter for 10-15 minutes because they were having a shift change. There's nothing wrong with that, but the lady at the front desk didn't have to be so Snyde about it. Once he waited for so long he came back out to the car and I went in and basically yelled hello across the counter and then was finally checked out, and the lady who rang everything out was rude the whole time because she didn't care, and the other employees were laughing the whole time. Terrible, ignorant customer service",

  "text": "The clerk talked politely and acted rudely, but food was good.\n\nI went there with 2 friends at 7pm on Saturday. I didn't make reservation, but there were not so much consumers waiting. In this restaurant, they have \"reservation area\" with booths and \"non-reservation area\" with a counter and small tables. The clerk led us to a very tiny table for 2 people though we were 3, then he left us there and had gone. He had unusual hospitality, but we got a another small table where we 3 could take seats at last.\n\nWe ordered two Prim Rib steaks and a roasted salmon, and a server asked us how we liked our steaks cooked. I think that their Prim Rib steak is very delicious and is better than that of Texas Loadhouse, because of not only the meat itself but also the 2 sauces.\nHowever, anxiously, they didn't provide their bread for us. They have unusual hospitality and services.\n\nI am going to try the restaurant again with reservation.",

  "text": "Ordered from here before they moved to the new location, so maybe the food has also changed. Ordered delivery for a few co-workers. The wait was long. In fact, a prior attempt to order from here was cancelled because the delivery time was 2 hours...we didn't even get things that were cooked, so this was confusing.\n\nI got a salad. It was fresh enough for a deli that probably specializes in sandwiches, but the dressing was awful.  It was thick and gritty with sugar. I actually had to add a few spoonfuls of water to thin it out and dissolve the sugar. I would have actually preferred bottled dressing at that point. \n\nOverall, no one was impressed. Prices are decent, but the food was just average.",

I ordered the chilaquiles for breakfast and they were really good. They came with pancakes or toast (i got the pancakes because pancakes are awesome). The decor is rustic with wood everywhere. Our server was on top of things and made sure our needs were being met. I would definitely go back.",

  "text": "At one point in time, The Foodery was the ONLY place to go for mixed six-packs of good quality craft beer. The times, however, have changed rapidly. The Foodery has not!\n\nThis Foodery still hasn't decided whether it wants to be a bodega or a bottle shop, which in a store that small means that there's not a lot of room to walk around. Once you get more than 5 people in the store, you're literally pressed up against each other as you try to open the fridge doors. If you go before 4pm, you'll have room to shop, but the staff the works during the day don't know shit about beer, including one woman who doesn't drink beer at all. The night time staff is more on the ball.\n\nThere are literally dozens of other bottle shops now that have better selection and lower prices (Beer Heaven, Beer Love, the Bottle Shop, Pennsport Beer Boutique, the Beer Peddlers, etc.), so it's not worth it to pay the extra $5-$10 per bottle unless you're really, really lazy. It's especially galling when you consider that they own their own beer distributor, Global, but are still overcharging you.",

  "text": "Overall: Grassfed Missouri raised cow with homemade patties! Can you ask for more?\n\nAmbience: This place is located in a busy corner of downtown STL. Parking is street only, just like most places in downtown. When you come inside, you'll notice, this restaurant is pretty big. You almost never need a reservation but it is good to have one for larger parties. The crowd is here everything from families to college friends to tourists.\n\nFood: The place offers Missouri raised grass fed beef. So you know you're getting good stuff. If you're not into beef, their chicken burgers are also really good. I will say though their vegetarian patties aren't as flavorful. I have been to very few burger places that can do a good veggie patty. After all, this is a burger joint. We hope you didn't come here for veggie patty. We asked for ketchup and they had a house made version. I'll say, I'm not a fan of it. It tastes like puree than ketchup. The sauces on burgers could use some inspiration. They have the basics such as siracha, mayo, mustard, bbq... But if you really want to set your burger apart, step up your game on the sauce!\n\nDrinks: They have a pretty nice bar with TVs, if you're looking for a place to eat by yourself. With that said their spiked shakes are pretty awesome. If you haven't, you should try their normal shakes and ice cream too!\n\nService: It was pretty busy when we came here, yet the service was fast. Our server cared for what we wanted and checked up on us a few times.\n\nPrice: $12-$14 for a burger with no sides is alright. You could throw fries with it and charge extra for other sides such as sweet potato fries or onion rings. Still can't complain.",

  "text": "Really 2.5 stars.  Arrived shortly before 1 on a Saturday to an empty hostess station and not a server in sight.  There were three tables with customers so not busy.  We waited a few minutes and the bartender saw us and seated us in the bar.  She was fairly friendly.  As stated in other reviews the chips are not complementary.  I had a craving for nachos as my meal anyway so I didn't care.  The bartender recommended the buffalo chicken nachos so that is what I ordered.  You do not want the nachos.  The tortilla chips are too thick, under salted and boring.  The toppings were quite good.  Hubby ordered the restaurant's equivalent of a pulled pork sandwich and fries.  Sad fries... too greasy so they lack crispness.  The sandwich he found to be just ok.  The pork in my opinion had great flavor.  We were underwhelmed and in a town with lots of Mexican food we will not be back.",
