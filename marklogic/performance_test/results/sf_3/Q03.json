  "text": "Let me start off with saying that I grew up in Reno and I am happy to see a longtime Reno business like Roy Fosters stay competitive.  Now with that out of the way...\n\nI was referred to Roy Fosters by my regular mechanic because he doesn't have the equipment to deal with an issue that my truck is having with its computer.   I called Fosters and asked if they could help and I was told that they could and to just \"bring it on down:.  The next day I loaded up my son and our bikes in the truck and drove down to Fosters to leave my truck for repairs.  When I went into drop off the keys and fill out the paperwork the man working the counter said he needed to check to make sure they could do the work.  He came back and said that they needed to \"check it out\" and that their subscription to the service that would fix the computer had expired.   I asked him why they told me to come down if they were unable to help  and his reply was \"Roy's out of town until Monday\"   This made no sense to me but whatever.   Then they asked me to leave the truck so they could look it over and they would get back to me with an estimate for the work that was needed.  This left me with the feeling that they were trying to bait and switch me so  I loaded my son and myself back in to the truck and that will be the last time I ever bring a vehicle to Roy Fosters Automotive.",

We headed over to the bar area to purchase the sandwich tickets, they also had a pot of chili for $6 a bowl. The sandwiches were delicious!!! My husband also enjoyed his bowl of chili. I'd definitely eat here again when we visit the central coast.",

  "text": "I have been going to Scott Dentistry for 2 Years now. Excellent dentist! I noticed that they had started providing a new service for teeth whitening, a 40% hydrogen peroxide. I had used the bleaching trays that they sell with fare results but I wanted something more powerful. \n\nI get my teeth cleaned every 3 months so I scheduled this whitening a couple days after a teeth cleaning, I wanted maximum results. When I arrived at my appointment there was some paperwork to fill out, most describing the procedure and what the expectations of undergoing the procedure. Which I really liked, because depending on the condition of your teeth the whitening could work or wouldn't. \n\nI was taken back by Mandy and was again described in detail of how the procedure was to be performed. She compared my teeth on a color wheel and gave an expectation of what the whitening would do. She was very articulate in letting me know what she was doing and what she needed me to do. I was able to do three treatments of the whitening during my appointment. Mandy notified me at the start of the side effects of the whitening (shocking feeling in my teeth) which I didn't start to feel until the end of the third treatment. Mandy told me they would go away in one to two days but mine subsided after 8 hours and using fluoride toothpaste. \n\nAfter the treatment was over we compared my teeth on the color wheel and my teeth had whitened a shade whiter. I couldn't have been happier! Later that night I was at my nephews Christmas concert and we were standing in the dark and my mom says \"boy your teeth are so white\"! Exactly what I was looking for! Totally worth the time and money. It now has been three weeks since the whitening and my fiancé still makes comments how white my teeth are!!!",

  "text": "I rarely write reviews but after spending $200+ for 4 adults and a child for Sunday brunch, I feel it is necessary.  I love food and I have no problem spending a lot of money on food but there was nothing memorable about this experience other than how much I enjoyed the atmosphere and the company, which we brought ourselves.  The salads were unique but didn't offer anything exciting in flavour. The eggs on the bennies were poached hard, potatoes were undercooked and the chai/eggnog pudding was more like a gelatine, wasn't smooth and creamy as  it should be.  The omelette my husband had made was slightly undercooked on the inside.  No one at the table raved about anything that they had and we left the restaurant uninspired. The Huevos Benedict was the only item that was intriguing and the one Benedict out of the 4 at our table that wasn't poached hard, and I did enjoy that.  When you spend $40+ for a brunch, you want to keep returning to try everything and it is so unfortunate that this was not the case.   The service was ok.",

  "text": "Wow!! I must say I'm very pleasantly surprised! With so many Vietnamese restaurants opening, you start to expect a lot from each new one. I came with a couple of friends tonight and shared several dishes (which is honestly the best way to do it to get a sample of the menu in one sitting).  We shared the pork belly and oxtail buns and sticky chicken wings to start off and the combination pho (brisket, steak, and meatballs), lemongrass chicken and rice, shaken steak and rice, wonton soup, Kim chi burger with sweet potato fries, and the steak and eggs for our entrees.  We weren't the biggest fans of the buns, but everything else was fantastic!  And it's quite rare for us to like so many dishes during a first visit at any new restaurant, so we were all thoroughly impressed.  The pho broth was delicious!! I'm pretty darn picky when it comes to pho, but Mint makes it very flavorful; it doesn't necessitate the addition of many condiments.  Both the shaken steak and lemongrass chicken were very tender and, again, very flavorful.  We enjoyed the Kim chi burger, but just a little more cooked for my taste.  The sweet potato fries were perfect though!!    If I had to choose my two favorite dishes, it would have to be the pho and the lemongrass chicken. YUM!  Definitely coming back for that.\n\nMint has a very eclectic decor: a mix of different textures and styles.  I was trying to find a common theme, but \"eclectic\" was the best I can describe it.  The service was great.  Very timely and efficient.  \n\nOverall, we all had an awesome first experience and will definitely be back to try more dishes!  Happy to see uptown with another quality Vietnamese restaurant.",

The interior is a little spacious and has a lot of seatings which is great for family and groups. Like some reviews, I agree that the broth is not as flavorful and it somehow tastes similar. The noodle itself was a little soggy as well. However, on the positive note, the service was very good, the staffs were very attentive and our food came out fast and hot. For about $11-13 the portion here is very generous, your belly will be fully satisfied :) Perhaps it was a bad day but this place has potential. Might come again in the future",

On my last two visits I had the pleasure of being seated at a table in Charlotte's area. On previous occasions the waitresses were very efficient and knowledgeable about the various dishes, but Charlotte seems to bring that something 'extra' along with perfect service. A charming personality that makes you feel like she's happy you've chosen Caruso's for your dinner.\n\n*Note to manager/owner : As a manager  myself for several years in the retail business, I want you to know she did everything the right way business-wise. When she arrived at my table with the glass of ice water she also asked if I would like a glass of wine to start things off, then throughout the meal stopped by several times to inquire if everything was OK and could she do anything else to make my visit even better, perhaps another glass of wine? \n At the end of the meal she brought the dessert menu and was ready to make a suggestion if I had left any room after that fabulous meal of clam sauce and red marinara over angel hair pasta. All this in spite of it being a Friday night between 7 and 9 o'clock when the restaurant was busy busy busy. \n\nIs this the kind of service customers should expect at a restaurant? Of course. Is it the kind of service you get in most restaurants here in Tucson? No.\nHer excellent service, individuality and personality have made each visit a pleasurable one. That's why Charlotte really stands out in the crowd. \nAnd the food? 5 stars.",

The place was literally empty but the staff was very friendly and helpful when I mentioned it was our first time there. \n\nI ordered a half sized cheese pizza in the \"round\" shape option (as opposed to the \"square\" shaped option which I thought was a little odd you had to choose the shape?) and the portion size was generous. \n\nThe food was pretty good, I took home the leftovers to eat the next day. \n\nSomething I didn't like is the large metal bench that runs the length of the restaurant as seating for several tables. The ledge to sit on is really shallow and has a high, straight backrest behind it so you are literally on the edge of your seat the whole time you are sitting there. It's really uncomfortable, beware if you plan to bring elderly folks with you as they probably won't be able to sit on it. There are real chairs available too though. \n\nOverall, it was a pretty standard pizza shop, but it's in a good location and the food isn't bad.",

  "text": "This place was on my list for very long and finally I got the chance to give it a try.\nFirst of all, I have to say the owner and staffs are so friendly and welcoming. Great thumbs up for that!\nThe 4-star rating is all due to the food.\nI ordered the classic Cuban since it should be the signature dish. I hate to be so snobby but this is not a cheap cheap place with around $10 per sandwich. The portion size is huge for sure, but I really expected the ingredients can be better.\nThe texture of the bread is nice but so lacking good flavor.\nThe mustard and cheese are ok.\nThe roasted pork and ham have a dampened taste instead of pleasant porky aroma.\nAltogether, it is just a really bland sandwich (in terms of flavor but not salt) \n\nI also tried the special rice sides called Moros. The bacon bits are lovely but spice is a little overpowering.\n\nOverall, maybe it's just me that I am not a big fan of Cuban cuisine in general. But I feel it is a little bit overrated.",

  "text": "I've tried to like Ladue Nails and Spa, despite its convenient location, but after multiple visits and yesterday's disaster, I will NEVER return. The place is enormous with lots of \"pedi\" chairs. It's staffed with lots of people too, who seem to have a lot of time of their hands. If the staff spent more time on YOU and less time watching t.v. and talking on the phone while you're getting a service, it would be more professional. The foot/leg massage that typically accompanies a pedicure was pathetic - lasting about a minute on each leg. When I questioned the duration of the massage, the attendant couldn't understand what I was saying. I decided to drop the whole thing, vowing to never return. Oh sure, there are some very nice people who work there, but when I want a manicure or pedicure I want to feel special and NOT rushed. Ladue Nails and Spa is all about getting you in and getting you out!! Rush, rush, rush!! Hey, the attendants have phone calls to make and t.v. to watch!!\nPAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!",

  "text": "Would not recommend. Did not have a good experience. The woman in charge made promises and did her best to accommodate, but the cleaners sent to my home did not follow through. There were many missed details that were guaranteed over the phone and were not even touched. After several pics were sent to the owner and a few phone calls, a second crew was sent out a couple days later to remedy the first crew's poor cleaning. Mediocre at best. Oh btw, they don't have vacuums with hoses, they don't vacuum couches, I don't think they have a stepladder to get to high (6ft) places, like the top of a cabinet or fridge or the promised fans. I let them borrow mine... and they only seem to clean what you point out. (Why am I pointing out what I already went over with the person on the phone?, why didn't the cleaners get a list that was discussed?) There seems to be a huge dissonance between employer and employees here. I should have just called out of work and cleaned the house myself instead of wasting my family's time and money here.

There's not a lot of places within walking distance to even go eat at besides the usual pizza and sandwiches. However, I was a little disappointed. I'm a vegetarian so my opinion is a little bias, but the food was very average. You walk in and order on touch screens. They really need a \"build your own option\". The vegetarian options were very limited. I did however like that the veg options were pretty healthy. I went with the veg bowl which was average - filling because of the egg and quinoa but nothing special with the taste. Kinda salty too. We waited a long time for our food (considering it's supposed to \"fast\"). They didn't offer any hot sauce or anything to fill up on the side - instead they had ketchup and mustard which is just so strange for a taco place. There's additional seating upstairs, but it kind of smells like a bathroom up there. The wait staff was very friendly. \n\nI don't see myself trying this place again, it was nothing extraordinary at all.",

So nice and helpful since they have a great big yummy menu board. We decided on a City Sampler. We were so pleased! (They have Nehi soda!!! Just a blast from the past!)\nThe slaw is the best I have ever had. The beans, I have to admit are even better than mine. They were cooked to perfection with some brisket in them. The meats were tender and tasty. The sauces were good, the original my favorite, but in the end, I felt like it was an injustice to put sauce on any of them, since they stood up well on their own. The brisket was my favorite. The wood was piled high outside and the smell of the fire was just heavenly. \nOn to the nice people! Even though you go up to get your food, we were so kindly attended to. We went at a slow time, which is our typical dinner time. I can imagine the place gets really busy though. \nThe atmosphere was very fitting for a barbecue place. I love the barbecue history on the wall. I love the wood and the aluminum ceiling. \nWe got our food very quickly, but in NO WAY was this fast food. Just well prepared, easy to serve and cooked to perfection. The prices, considering what we got were frankly amazing. I am marking this as under $10 per person, but we don't get drinks, so factor that in. \nI could keep going, but I have banana pudding to try! I get the feeling they are going to get to know my husband and I very well!",

One of my favorite things about The Eagle Inn is the fact they provide complimentary bike rentals for their guests, it makes getting around the neighborhood much more enjoyable. \n\nIt's not a 5-star hotel, but it's quaint, charming, and fancy enough to let you know your money was well spent.\n\nThe room was absolutely perfect -- detached from the main building there was certainly an added sense of privacy.

  "text": "The Children's Museum has been a place of discovery for me and my family, to say the least. Not only in that my kids have all ooohed and awwwed over the dinosaurs, the water table, bulldozers and of course, the store (!), but also because of the heart wrenching, terrible minutes when I lost my kid there.\n\nYeah. I'm that mom.\n\nThe Children's Museum staff jumped to action when I alerted them that my oldest son, about 2 1/2 at the time, had run off. He had run way ahead of me on the ramp (don't all the kids do this?), but I was behind a stroller, and the crowds were huge that day, and what looked like a busload or 10 had just unloaded on the bottom floor ... and, and ... he was gone.\n\nI was on my own discovery mission. And the staff members were rallying in our favor.\n\nI am not kidding you. The young man I frantically talked to that day immediately radioed to the front doorman and told him to go on a lockdown. They were about to lock down the museum ... and they might have. I don't know because I ran off looking for my kid again once I realized they were also on the case.\n\nWe found him on the bottom floor in something I think was a submarine or something. \n\nAnyway, long story short (too late), we love the museum. Aside from the fact that I had a horrible day there one time, the staff rallied around us and made us feel so secure and cared for. I have never, ever, ever in my entire life had that kind of \"customer service.\" \n\nThumbs WAY UP to the museum and all its fun-filled treasures. Especially the ones you find hidden in the submarine.",

Unfortunately it is on a side street off of Bustleton and is easy to miss.   Look for the Shell station on the west side of Bustleton and you will find Da Vinci's down a side street on the east side of Bustleton.\n\nWe ordered a pizza with pepperoni and onions.   The thin crust was chewy and crisp (not every pizzeria can achieve that combo), and the proportion of sauce and cheese to crust was spot on.   Using Tacconelli's and ZaVino's pizza as the gold standard, DaVinci's is a solid 4.  The deficits were that the sauce was not as piquant as I would have liked and the center of the pie was soggy.

  "text": "This was our second time at TBBC.  The first time we went for drinks and apps and that's what we should have done this time.\n- When we walked in, there was no one at the hostess stand.  We didn't wait that long but when the hostess walked up she literally just stared at us.   I mean, she didn't say a word.  No greeting, no welcome, nothing.  Zero, zip, nada.   VERY strange behavior for a hostess.   She actually never said anything so we finally told her we had a party of six and she took us to a table.   The table she took us too was crammed into a corner and was just a very uncomfortable fit.   We asked if we could move to another table, a round one up by the bar, and you would have thought we'd asked her for a kidney.   She seemed so put out and exasperated that we would asked to be moved.  \n- Our group ordered appetizers, which were good.  Nothing spectacular though...yummy cheese and mustard sauces for the, obviously, frozen pretzels.  The salsa was okay, chips, meh.  Hands down, Chili's has the best chips around.   Several of our party tried the beer flights, which they really enjoyed.   \n- This is the first time we've ever eaten inside, and we did not have this when we ate outside the previous time, but they brought bottles of cold water, about the size of a wine bottle, to your table, where water glasses already sat.   They kept replenishing the bottles throughout the meal.  A cute concept but had to keep asking for ice (they brought one glass, to be shared with the table).  Like I said, cute concept, but again, I personally prefer ice water and don't want to have to keep asking for ice during my meal.  \n- The food.  Ahhh, where to begin?    I had a cup of their beer cheese soup, which, WAS tasty, but it just seemed to be lacking something.   Which, honestly, pretty much sums up everything there.   I ordered the Southwest Black Bean Burger with a side of fries (fries, at the recommendation of our server, over the white-cheddar mashed potatoes).    This was truly one of the most BLAH burgers I have ever eaten.  If I had not asked for onion on it, I don't think it would have had ANY taste.  The guacamole crème on the burger had NO taste, at all.   I think it was just pureed avocado, with nothing else added.   Another thing, and this is just my personal preference, the buns are ciabatta and I just don't like ciabatta buns for a burger.   I like a good, old-fashioned, sesame-seed topped hamburger bun.   I only ate about a third of the burger and left the rest.  The fries were completely non-descript; McDonald's fries are a 1,000 times better.  My boyfriend ordered their Red-Eye burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare; it was served well-done with SO much extras glopped on, he had to eat it with a fork.  He, however, got some fancy ketchup for his fries, which I did not.   The fancy ketchup still couldn't disguise the fact that the fries were so blah.\n- Overall, a very lacking and disappointing experience.    We would definitely not go back for a meal, and not even sure if we would for apps and drinks.  Personally, I don't care for craft beer and there are many other places to go with better drink offers and better apps.",

Thank goodness for a new place to eat at.. \nI will be honest, I was skeptical of this \"steakhouse\" opening because I thought the prices would be high but the prices are comparable if not lower than the other restaurants at Streets. \nThe Happy Hour is by far the best in the area. Several drinks ranging from $5-7. Appetizers/small plates ranging from $5-7. The Mahi tacos were certainly my favorite part of the trip, cooked perfectly with a delicious avocado salsa and scrumptious sauce on top. I tried the black diamond martini upon the waitress' request and I was not disappointed-- it was simply amazing! We also tried the pretzel and beer cheese dip, shrimp tacos, and buffalo style chicken tenders-- all of which were delicious. The beer cheese dip wasn't AS incredible as the rest but the competition was steep! Someone has to come in last place, right?\nThe service was phenomenal!! Catherine was our server and she couldn't have made a better first impression. My friend is quite the talker and Catherine did well entertaining my friend while remaining attentive, professional, and friendly.  Rich, the manager, and Earl, the chef, stopped by the table to make sure my friend and I were satisfied. They were very pleasant as well. \nThe atmosphere and decor is beautiful. We sat in the \"Firebar\" by the fireplace which was comfortable and relaxing. \nThey certainly set the bar high tonight, I hope the newness doesn't wear off.",

  "text": "My husband was co-chairman of a charity Golf event at Feather Sound and we could not be more pleased with the outcome.   We worked closely with Francine Burruezo and Robert \"Rob\" Spiars. \n\nThe venue is amazing, has been recently remodeled but it pales in comparison to the staff.  They had a member event in the AM, a child's birthday party, a member birthday party in the evening and still got everyone where they needed to be without issue.  \n\nThey made suggestions to make our event better and provided much help behind the scenes.  \n\nFrancine's smallest suggestion was listened to because of the expertise she displayed.   She was able to rely on wait staff, the dining and bar staff to execute her plan flawlessly. Her faith in their professionalism made us trust them to do their jobs.  \n\nRob managed the golfers and our lack of skill without a hiccup. Even when he was out of town he returned correspondence promptly and professionally.  As carts were returned from the Members event, they appeared clean and ready for our event.   Rob made sure Aaron and his other staff were aware of our first time organizer needs and took great care of our volunteers and guests. Rob personally updated scoring info into the evening to make it all happen just as the sun was setting.  \n\nAs soon as their work was done, they faded into the background so we could take all the credit.  \n\nThe wait, golf and kitchen staff were courteous, kind and provided endless help throughout the day.  Every time I turned around there was a neatly dressed Feather Sound Staff member helping out our volunteers and guests. \n\nThe Members as well were welcoming at every turn on the course or in the clubhouse.  \n\nIn all we raised much more funds for our charity due to the excellence of the staff and facility.",

  "text": "Soo I was so excited to try Fat Ham and I have to say I was wholly underwhelmed. I'm a definite fan of K. Sbraga but this was really a disappointment. I ordered the hot chicken and was expecting crispy fried chicken with a kick. Instead I got 2 small pieces of crispless chicken with no heat. There was nothing hot about this chicken, literally and figuratively.  The white bread that supposedly comes with dish was pitiful. I didn't even notice the bread and further more it was super soggy after being drenched in a forgettable season less ranch sauce that served no purpose since the chicken wasn't spicy.\n\nAfter the whack chicken I ordered dessert as I was still super hungry. I got the red velvet cake which was decent. It was moist with the right amount of crumble, and was not overly sweet. \n\nI have to say that if I come back to Fat Ham it will be for dessert and not much else.",

We always ask for a room farthest from the elevators, because of the drunks going down the halls late at night and being crazy loud. We were there midweek this time, so it was lovely at night...nice and quiet...UNTIL the fire alarm ripped into our room for 5 minutes straight at 2:30am. We understand the alarm for emergencies...  but we would've appreciated an \"all clear\" announcement after the fact... we laid  in bed after being awoken from a deep sleep not knowing if we had to evacuate or what.

  "text": "I first heard about Famoso's on the day we moved to Edmonton, when we asked a neighbour about good restaurants in the neighbourhood.  We discovered this place early on and it has remained a favourite since our arrival.  I am only half joking when I tell people that we bought our home in Oliver to stay within walking distance of this place.  It's truly fantastic.\n\nThe salads?  Outstanding.  Every single one.  And I have tried all the vegetarian ones.  The appetizers?  Delicious.  Again, every vegetarian one.  Desserts?  Spectacular.  All of them.  (We sometimes even walk to Famoso just to get a scoop of their gelato).  The wine?  Fantastic.  Every recommendation from the staff has been spot on.  The coffee?  Sublime.\n\nBut the main reason we come here is for the pizza.  It is simply wonderful.  Their thin crust is crisp, yet pliable, always cooked to perfection.  And every pizza combination we have tried has been superb (and we have tried every vegetarian pizza, in both red sauce and white sauce - I love that you can switch up the sauces!).  Their seasonal pizzas are always top-notch as well.  \n\nWe've never been disappointed when coming to Famoso, oh, except when the line is longer than we were hoping.  But an hour to wait for this meal is worth it!  Totally worth it.",

The place looked like it was closed but the sign on the door said that dine-in closes at 9 but that take-out is open until 10.  I walked in and the waitress said that they were closed.  I pointed out the sign on the door which she read and said \"Oh, I guess we're open then.\"\n\nI ordered a small cheese pizza with extra cheese which came to almost $13.00.  They were shutting down the restaurant while I waited.\n\nWhen the pizza was done, the box they handed me was the size of a CD (well not that small but pretty small.  See the picture I've attached with the pizza next to a remote).  For $13.00 I expected their small would be larger than 9\".\n\nThe pizza itself was ok.  I got the Neapolitan crust which was pretty good.  The sauce was very tangy and was more like a spaghetti marinara than a pizza sauce, although not bad.  There was a lot of cheese but it wasn't sliced very well so the whole pizza fell apart when trying to take a slice.\n\nOverall, the pizza just didn't seem put together very well.  It kind of tasted like a pizza you might try to make at home with ingredients from Winn Dixie.\n\nThe menu is pretty large and has a lot of items other than pizza.  I'm not sure if I will try this place again.  I will update the review if I do.",

We were so hungry that we decided to just take the risk. I am so glad we did as we loved it so much we came back twice during our stay.\n\nTheir Jambalaya was wonderful and portion was just right. It had the perfect amount of spice. My boyfriend ordered the crawfish combo and he loved it. The next day we ordered their crawfish po boy and that was great as well. The only negative was their bread pudding it could have been much better.\n\nService was wonderful both times and that is saying a lot since for some reason New Orleans is not the place to find southern hospitality. \n\nI would definitely come back here if I am ever back in NOLA.",

Our servers were amazing and so helpful in suggestions. We started with the fried green tomatoes. So yummy. Next was the BBQ shrimp. Oh my goodness. The sauce... save your bread they bring to the table with the butter to dip in this sauce. You get two pieces with the dish but more is needed to soak up the last drop. Bowl is worth licking if no one is looking. We then got the fried oyster appetizer and another super tasty dish. Simple but amazing. We finished with the white chocolate brownie that was suggested by our server as her favorite. She didn't steer us wrong. Another amazing dish at Mr. B's. Everyone around us was raving in about their food too. Go here you won't be disappointed. Drink specials were also fabulous. I'll be raving about this meal for a long time.",

I walked in around 10:30 and walked up to the counter and was told the kitchen was closed. Talk about feeling bummed out after looking over their tasty menu options. We were standing outside for about 10 minutes and got called back in because the kitchen was some how opening. I am not sure what happened, but I am sure glad I was able to order my Belgian waffle. I added bananas and chocolate chips for a .50 cent up charge and it took the waffle to the next level. The waffle is made with a cinnamon vanilla buckwheat batter and topped with walnuts and syrup. The waffle also comes with a side and I went with the bacon of course. It was nice thick and crispy. You can tell they only use the freshest of ingredients. The coffee mugs are a pretty decent size which allowed me to enjoy more of my peach white tea. \n\nWhat I thought made this cafe unique was that it served beer. This isn't your typical coffee shop. They have something for everyone. You also order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you when its ready. The interior was very modern chic. I loved the tufted benches and light fixture in the larger dining area. They also have a really neat patio and lots of tables inside.

However, Schlafly Bottleworks has a couple minor details to work on. \n\nCons\n \n- No wait service in the bar area. You must go to the bar to order everything and the 1 food runner/buser was not good at all about coming and cleaning off dirty dishes from the tables. I carried most of our dirty plates away myself b/c we ran out of room on the table. Yuck! Let's work on the service aspect guys.\n\n- The food is not that great. I would give the food 2.5 stars after multiple visits. \n\nPros \n\n- Awesome atmosphere. The bartender got up and sang a song with the band. Pretty laid back and friendly all around. \n\n- Kick ass, huge patio/beer garden in the summer, and they have live bands out there too. Always a fun time! \n\n- They host multiple beer festivals throughout the year.\n\n- Obviously, fantastic locally made micro brews. Pumpkin Ale, Oktoberfest, and Summer lager seasonals are my favorites!\n\nOverall, I LOVE SCHLAFLY. The end.",

  "text": "I would like to share a sad story turned happy. I am a single mother of 4 and my house was broken into and a lot was stolen including all my camping stuff,  kids tablets,  bikes,  even food. I don't make a lot of money so i haven't been able to take my kids camping for a long time. I set out looking for used sleeping bags,  lantern, misc camping stuff. I went to yard sales, thrift stores etc... i came up empty. I went to salvation army today and a worker there said that they didn't have any sleeping bags or anything for camping and that i should try twin city. I walked into twin city and spoke to an associate and i asked if they negotiate.  She told me that yes they do but i would need to speak to the manager.  The manager Jessica was not there at the time so i waited, as i waited i was looking at the pieces and thought jeez there's no way i can afford this stuff. When Jessica arrived i explained my story to her and she told me she would give me a 15% discount. I was a bit worried and thought shoot i probably won't have enough money even with the discount.  Once i got up to the register to figure out how much it would be,  Jessica walked over and gave me 50% off EVERYTHING  i couldn't believe it. I gave her a hug and started crying. I appreciate her more than she will ever know. I can take my kids now on a much needed camping trip. THANK YOU SO MUCH!",

  "text": "My first experience with the Prohibition Taproom was my housemate Jonny telling me that messed up his drink order and that he was not impressed. Despite that, I wanted to try out this new place.\n\nBefore I even walked in, I was greeted by an awesome sign pointing out the business. It's a simple neon red sign that tersely states \"BAR.\" I like it a lot. Once inside, I was loving the atmosphere. The bar is really great, as you can kind of see in this picture. It runs the length of the room, but also has a few peninsulas. The result is that you can sit at the bar and be across from whoever you are with, which is a great feature.\n\nAs far as beer goes, PT does not disappoint. There are about ten beers on draft. Further, the choices represent a well thought out variety of brews. PT also supplies a nice bottle list as a supplement. I had the Dogfish Head Aprihop and Brooklyn Brewery Blunderbuss and enjoyed both beers.\n\nI can seriously recommend to anyone to go to Prohibition Taproom for one reason: deep-fried green beans. This phenomenal appetizer is a great way to start your meal and comes with a nice aioli. The rest of the food was average. Between Lana, J.Mal, and myself, we ordered two burgers and a grilled cheese, and these three dishes were fine, nothing more. I was happy to be full, but the main dishes are the lowest point of the experience.\n\nFriday night this place got a little crazy, with a crowd from art museum area and plenty of \"bros.\" Don't make this your Friday or Saturday night hangout spot.\n\nBottom Line: I like this new place. It has good atmosphere, beer, and one excellent appetizer. Prohibition Taproom has made it onto my list of bars to regularly visit. The biggest downside are the hours. No lunch, no brunch, and the bar opens at 4pm.",

  "text": "I love Jones for dinner, I have been there on multiple occasions and always had a great meal, great cocktails and great service. The food is very affordable, the cocktails can really add up though. It's definitely a one or two drinks with dinner type of place.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere is great, it's got a modern retro diner feel with a fire place in the middle, very cool looking exposed stone as walls and the mural behind the bar of the 50s women playing with red balloons is awesome. Pretty much everything fits the theme from the chairs to the lights. I also like that the waiters and waitresses wear jeans and tshirts, I know I love my job more because I can go to work in jeans and a tshirt. \n\nNow as for brunch - I had a gift card and my boyfriend and I wanted brunch, I love Jones so I figured yesterday would be the perfect opportunity to try the brunch, take my boyfriend there who has never been and get a free or very cheap meal. We walked in around 2:15 (brunch lasts til 3) and were sat promptly. The restaurant was busy so maybe coming towards the end allowed us an immediate seat because the restaurant cleared out around 3. \n\nI got the BMW pancakes which were buttermilk pancakes with carmelized bananas and walnuts and maple syrup. Wasn't a fan of the bananas, but the pancakes were delicious. They give you way too much though, do people complain about getting too much food? haha.  It's literally three plate size pancakes that could easily fill two people. Definitely a good dish to share. The coffee is strong, the orange juice is fresh and the bloody marys are made to order (I got the classic jones mary with ketel one and olives stuffed with blue cheese - they get more interesting though - you can get jumbo shrimp, old bay on the rim, and countless other things.) \n\nThe only negative is that the waitress got my order wrong because apparently she misheard me so instead of BMW pancakes I originally got Potato pancakes. My dish had to get sent back while my boyfriends got a little cold sitting there because he was being polite.\n\nBut despite that, I definitely recommend it, I will definitely be returning.",

You come here because it has an awesome atmosphere and puts you in the mood to let loose and party. Their take on tex mex isn't bad but it's nothing to write home about. However, I do love their salsa and I usually fill up on chips and salsa before I even get my entree. Their margaritas while kinda pricey certainly pack a punch!",

  "text": "Thanks to earlier reviews, we somewhat know what to expect. We would have given 5 stars for the food, but the service was so poor that we had to take 1 away. Pluses: We got drunken noodles and Thai pacific noodles, both tasted fantastically!  Minuses: \n1. the restaurant is extremely shortly staffed. We were told there was only 1 person making the food, and as we can see, only 1 person running the table. It took a really long time for our food to come out (more than 30 minutes). When we stopped the waitress to add an appetizer, her replies were \"uh oh... we only have 1 chef so it won't come out for a while\"\n2.  When we arrived, the 5 of us were seated at a round table. But we were rudely moved to a smaller table after we placed our orders, saying that she meant to reserve that table for a group of 8, who never showed up the entire time we were there. We felt that the waitress just shooed us and moved us as we were inconveniencing her. She was rude and lacks any sign of hospitality you'd least expect from any restaurant. When we were ordering food, I asked to only have bok choy, and no other vegetables, but I'd take whatever extra they're willing to give me, which was when I was told that it was going to cost extra. \n3. Again, thanks to earlier review, I warned my husband to double check the bill before he pays for it. Sure enough, we were charged for one extra plate. \nWe're only visiting Nashville for a couple of nights. We would consider coming back due to the quality of the food, but we hope that the service would at least improve to normality then.",

Tonight will be our final visit.  Seafood cavatelli claims to have shrimp and crab in Alfredo sauce.  What arrived was about a cup of overcooked Cavatelli, swimming in a tasteless Alfredo, with 5 shrimp.  When I asked about the crab I was told that it was melted into the Alfredo sauce!!  I ate the shrimp.  Husband got the chicken parmigian special, his sauce was very watered down.  When we walked to our car we saw the owner, who we have met on previous visits, sitting in the sunroom area, with all of the lights out, a bottle of Jack Daniels on the table.

Now, neither Mary Ann nor Susan work here any more.\n\nI know that many of you, perhaps most of you, go to the bank simply to conduct business transactions.  And for the most part, that goes the same for me.  But the main reason I chose to go back to Whitney Bank upon my return from California, was the awesome personnel at the Harrison Avenue location; specifically Susan, Dianne and Mary Ann.\n\nNow that all three are gone, I can honestly say that the lobby is a much duller and colder place.  Other than the obligatory greeting by the new tellers, I no longer get that warm and fuzzy feeling that I used to.  Perhaps this specific location was unique among financial institutions.  All I know is that I miss the human touch that used to exist here.  Sure, the new tellers are all polite, but the old regime knew all of its clientele and spoke to them about their families while business was being conducted.  It truly was an enjoyable experience.\n\nI am still satisfied with the service I receive, and I plan to remain a Whitney customer.  However, I now see my infrequent visits here as strictly business and uneventful.  For most, I guess this is enough.  For me, not so much.",

Nice man in a tie and dress shirt. We chatted a few minutes about V -Town (Ventura) and football. Very amiable man.\n\nWhat struck me, which I told him, was the array of cars behind the glass window and the fellas working on them. Yes they needed repairs, but for as many cars and guys as there were it didn't come off as a oily auto shop. (not that there is anything wrong with that of course!)\n\nService: Excellent. I knew they would have it for several days. And it was finished on the day he estimated. Also dealt with the insurance company which I appreciated.\n\nPricing: I really didn't do any comparison to be honest. In truth the insurance was handling it.\n\nSummary:\nI passed by the car when I came back to pick it up. Why? It looked: So- Damn- Good. The bumper was new, paint exactly matched what I had.

  "text": "By far the best bubble tea in Tucson!\nThey use a variety of noticeably high quality brewed teas as the tea base for the bubble teas. They have a huge range of different drink options and toppings. I've been going to Chatime regularly for over a year now and I still find new drinks to try. You can adjust your sweetness level to your liking, so you don't have to worry about any drink being overly sweet. The staff is very friendly and will always help you decide on drink.  A great place to stop in and get a drink,  hang out to chat with friends, work, or play games. They have a small set of games that customers can play. It is also in range of a PokemonGo gym. \nDownsides: As with most bubble teas, most (but not all) of the flavored options use syrups mixed with the tea base. Sometimes the internet is spotty.",

The food was just as amazing as it was 10 years ago and the restaurant...wow what a makeover. It's so stylish and inviting now I didn't wanna leave.

  "text": "I stayed here for two nights recently for a friend's wedding and was largely impressed. The rooms are spacious and have good views, the lobby bar is nice and the food is good. I thought my room was well priced at 139/night, but that is below the normal price since we were part of a wedding guest block. The hotel staff were also very nice without being over the top. \n\nI only have two minor criticisms and I'd still recommend this hotel overall. First, the breakfast buffet is ridiculously expensive - 16 dollars for continental and a whole 35 dollars if you want anything hot. The food was good, but not 35 bucks for breakfast good! Walk to City Tap House for brunch instead. \n\nThe other criticism is an unfortunate circumstance rather than anything the hotel is doing wrong, but it still affects the experience - the street/block the hotel is on does not smell good. Something was up with the sewer or something. Hopefully it's not always like that. Fortunately our room was on the twentieth floor and the street level smell was not an issue there.",

  "text": "A decent hotel near the Vieux Carré and in the up and coming Warehouse District. And with a brand new bar and restaurant just opened in the lobby it makes for a convenient start or end to your day. Plus the Coffee and Beignet Co. breakfast annex to the side has some tasty pastries and snacks as well as some of the best beignet in Nola, without the lines. \n\nThe rooms are adequate for anyone's needs, good sized with a fridge and safe included. A rooftop pool and small gym make a morning workout relatively easy, probably necessary after the excesses the city is known for. Wifi was not included in the room so we had to go to the lobby to use the guest access. Our room overlooked the lobby from the 4th floor and on the 2nd day I discovered that the wifi signal was strong enough to reach there.\n\nWe booked on one of the big online travel websites so also got a good deal for the stay. Initially wanting to stay in the Vieux Carré, we did not find the rooms we needed,  and settled, we thought, on this hotel outside the demarcation. But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise as that area is a horrible place to stay unless you want to be in congested streets and around inebriated guest 24/7. Here taxis are quick to find, with speedy route access to other parts of the city and nearby trolley car accessibility much easier as well. Added bonus was that Rouses Market was an 8 minute walk away - the Nola equivalent of Whole Foods with far better prices and full of local products. \n\nI'll be back.",

Don't get me wrong, this is my neighborhood dive, and I'll take a dive over a pretentious snot bar any day. The food is alright, though there isn't much for veggies here. I usually get the spinach salad with bacon on the side for my critters, and something other than hot bacon dressing. The salad is generously portioned and pretty good. The atmosphere is LOUD. What?! It's loud! And your ears will usually be assaulted by wall shaking trendoid pop. The service here is dicey, unless you're a regular, then you might just get a PG rated version of a lap dance, while less recognized customers await, parched and frustrated.

We had to come back in and ask for the box, which was the whole point of getting that pretty expensive special, the girl gave us a \"why do you need it\" look and gave us the box.

  "text": "30th Street Station is a Philadelphia landmark for good reason. Arguably, the most beautiful train station I have been in! The neoclassical architecture is just awesome to see. High patterned ceilings and gorgeous marble floors are all very \"movie like\" LOL.  \n\nClean and orderly...lines seemed to be moving and windows weren't backed up. There are also food options that won't make you sick like Penn Station (according to my Uncle who works for Amtrak and eats there all of the time). I am not a huge train traveler, but when doing an NYC to Philadelphia trip (or vice versa)...the train is the way to go. Since I have family in both cities, it's a quick trip on Amtrak keystone. \n\nPlus, there's something cool and nostalgic about this train station and riding on the train, in general,  that I really like (for somewhat short trips, personally). If you are a train traveler or find yourself needing to take a trip to/from Philly, this is definitely a nice station for your travel needs. \n\nP.S. As of this review, there's a bit of construction happening and a facelift to the exterior of the building. Not too bad, but helpful to know. Happy Travels!",

Your coffee is good and that Miso Praline breakfast sandwich is like the blood of virgins between two biscuits. One of my favorite things to eat. Ever. Your donuts are always a treat, who doesn't like a damn donut? Maybe a gluten free vegan? But what the hell do they like anyway....\n\nContrary to what I just wrote, I don't really visit anymore. We got really sick of paying close to $30 to get breakfast from a donut shop that isn't full service. Also, the last time we went there I called in an order and waited in line to get it. While I was in line, I saw a lady tap a man and his daughter on the shoulder while they were eating their donuts and ask them, \"Excuse me, is that good?\" First of all, let this man enjoy a donut with his child in peace. Secondly, what the hell do you think? It's a chocolate donut filled with rice pudding. You like donuts? You like chocolate? You like rice pudding? Badda fucking Bing Bozo! It's a $2.50 investment. Donuts are like a roll in the hay, even when it's bad, it's good. \n\nClearly that experience made me realize that my neighborhood donut shop is frequented by tourists with dumb questions and intrusive behavior. I'll probably go back at some point on a slow day, but if anyone interrupts my snarfing session with a dumb question about a glazed donut, I'll let one out that's so vile, the whole place will be forced to evacuate.",

Honeys is a hip-sty cool spot with close seating & fun bar area.\nChalkboard menus adorn the walls with daily specials. Diner glass domes of sweets line the counter along with refreshed coffee cups and chatting locals. \n\nI love the laid back atmosphere of Honey's. The hostess was friendly and offered menus for kiddos and sat us right away. Our server was as laid back as can be but friendly.\n\nWe ordered the well known potato latkes with sour cream. These are fantastic and a must order. Crispy on the outside, squishy potato mash on the inside. My 8 year old devoured his immediately.\n\nLa Columbe coffee served here. A++ for that!\n\nKids had the egg sandwich on brioche bun & single pancake filled with chocolate. Pancakes are huge so for kiddos one is more than enough. My kids polished their plates... Thumbs up from the mini peeps.\n\nMy husband had the French toast special which was caramelized coconut & banana. Holy moly.. Yum! Gooey and sweet.\n\nI had the Toad In Hole which was by far my favorite. Hollandaise soaked Challah bread with a poached egg in the center topped with melted Jack cheese and truffle oil. Served with a side of spicy arugula with a tart lemon vinaigrette. To die for. The flavors were amazing together and the portion was just enough. \n\nOverall good experience. Only downside was we saw a couple come in and they sat so long without being served that they got up & walked out. Sadly they missed out on a crazy good toad in hole!",

Have been taking our cars to them since 2000 and could never switch to another because we KNOW what we are getting here...top notch service at fair prices, not the cheapest, but fair. Jamie is so knowledgeable, passionate about his business, as well as caring. He works with us on what is really needed and tells us what we can wait for which we appreciate being on a tight budget. \n\nHe has worked on all makes & models--we've taken to him both American and Foreign cars, trucks and an old minivan. He keeps us on the road with good regular maintenance and when we need a new used car he checks it over for us to make sure it's worthy. \n\nOne thing I really appreciate about Jamie is one time we had a really awesome (my opinion) older Acura. Had I not known, I'd just keep pouring money into it b/c I loved it. But Jamie said it was time to rebuild the engine and he wouldn't bother doing that because of the cost to value ratio. He recommended finding a new used car. Smart man. Thank you Jamie for so many years of awesome service!",

Disappointed that there were no kid options, but understood that we are kind of in the business district.  We ended up getting a half of a grilled cheese that was so toasted it was difficult for me to eat and close to impossible for the baby.  My salad arrived with no dressing :( fail number one.. I got the dressing and began to eat the salad.. when i took a few bites and felt grit in between my teeth I discovered that there was visible DIRT in my lettuce.

  "text": "One of the best brunch spots in town.  Get there early though because the secret was out long ago. Trying to get in on a sat/sun around 11-1 and you are probably looking at an hour plus wait. Why is it so popular? It probably has to do with the 2-4-1 cocktails, or maybe the red velvet waffles with cream cheese drizzle, or perhaps it's the signature \"white trash hash\"... a delicious concoction of cheese, hash browns, and scallions rolled into an almost crispy-shelled ball of tasty delight.  They have takes on all the traditional brunch classics as well... a variety of egg/benedict themed plates, waffles, and of course biscuits.  \n\nWhat I really like is that for all the heavy brunch menu items they have there is also a whole \"skinny\" section devoted entirely to those who are taking it light and counting calories. An egg white scramble, yogurt, and salads are among some of the things you will find on that menu. The brunch libations don't really pull any punches even though drinks are buy one get one free. Bloody Marys, trumped up Mimosas, and my favorite, the red berry sangria. \n\nMy advice is to get there right when they open at 10am. There will be a few people already lined up but you won't wait.  You'll be glad you did because by the time you leave the waiting area will be packed and you'll be able to walk out happy knowing you didn't have to sit through all that mess.",

The best part is you track each of your workouts so you see your progress. The group setting is great too. If you have worked out at gyms like YOUFIT or PLANET FITNESS, forget about em!! Orangetheory is backed up by science and is proven to better your health. Other gyms get boring after awhile, so good thing Orangetheory is not a gym. It is a classed based fitness studio. Best workout ever!",

  "text": "So I visited for the first time.  If there is something that ticks me off it is bad business sense.  So I ordered two tacos, the super burrito and chips and salsa for $3.50 for the chips and salsa.  A good Mexican meal requires chips and salsa. Let's forget the fact that they charged me for something I can get free at most Mexican restaurants.  To pay 3.50 you would think home made maybe? Heated? Something special?  No.  From the bag super cheap chips.  And the salsa came in this ketchup condiment small cup.  The chips wouldn't even fit in the salsa holder.  So I barely could get the salsa on my chip.  Because of the size, even with little salsa on each chip I had over half my chips and had run out of salsa.  So I go up and ask for more salsa.  $.25 more was the response.  Then she clarified, no $.50.  So something I get for free, normally with beans for free, I pay for anyway and now I can't get a refill without money.  I don't carry cash, and nobody wants to rerun their card for some odd amount of pocket change.  So then my food comes.  Chorizo taco was okay at best, and I kept thinking about no salsa for my chorizo either.  So then I eat the steak taco.  The whole time I'm staring at a half full basket of chips and no salsa.  The steak was dry and tasted funny.  Then I start in on the super burrito.  Man, if only I had salsa to put on it.  It was average at best.  In part, this place lost my business for life over $.50 and really $3.50 (I can get a freaking burrito almost for that cost).  Let's be honest.  We have plenty of Mexican food options in the valley, and For all that offer free chips and salsa with beans and refills why would I come back to this place when the food is comparable at best.",

After traveling 9 hours to this hotel and having received a confirmation email from Expedia within the past 48 hours, we arrived at The Alexander only to be told unapologetically at the front desk that they were overbooked and there was no room for us.  This essentially means they sold my room to someone else, likely for a higher rate than I paid.  Legal or not, it says a lot about this hotel's management.   We got no help from the hotel other than a toll-free number to Expedia.  The Alexander clearly did not see this as their problem and did not seem to care about mine.  Very disappointing.",

It is easily missed, it is a regular door in an alley like area., you knock to get in. \nIt is a cozy environment, and decor is very well done. It is slightly cramped. \nWhen you get there, they put towels, yes towels, over you, so anything you spill, can just go on that. Then you wash you hands, and then the food starts. \nThe food was in enormous portions, given we were just three of us, but we enjoyed all the courses! The chicken in the phyllo dough was unexpectedly delicious! the mix of sweet with the chicken flavors was great! The next course of chicken was so tender, it just came off the bone. The lamb was the next course and wow, loved it! \nOfcourse dessert was fruit and baklava...and the baklava gave me my full rush on sugar, and rightly so. And we all liked the mint tea, we actually asked for seconds!",

  "text": "If I were just rating the food, I'd give it 5 stars.   This is our neighbourhood restaurant and we have eaten here many times over the years.   It's the best place for miles around if you want authentic food prepared well.   The Chevapi appetizer is fabulous--well-seasoned sausages, with a light salad of tomato, feta, and onion. It's the perfect blend of flavours.    My go-to choices for entree are either the Jaeger Schnitzel or the Veal and Sage ravioli.  Both are richly flavoured, with a nice balance between dusky proteins and lighter sauce.   The walnut cream cake is simply not to be missed.  It is the platonic ideal of cake.  \n\nSo why only 4 stars?  The last three times we've gone as a small group (2 or 3 of us) there have been large groups.  The restaurant is very very small.  It seats maybe a total of 50 people--if that--and the owner-chef and her staff prepare all the food right there behind a high counter.   It's a cafe set up in the European style.    It's also one of those places that locals love.    If you're going there to have a quiet intimate dinner with your partner, you can forget it.  Because for some reason there is ALWAYS The Guy.   It's not the same guy, but it's the same type of guy.   He sits either at the end of his big group table or at the middle.  He brings his own wine (it's BYOB) and leaves his inside voice at home.   Tonite's version of The Guy lectured the entire large group on the merits of the Chevapi in that slightly tipsy way people get where they just repeat the same thing over and over (it's Chevapi! It's to die for! It's REAL BOSNIAN FOOD!!)   \nThis is a restaurant where 10 other people are eating besides his group of 12.  And yet after his party was served and the staff was frantically trying to catch up on the meals for the other 5 tables The Guy decided to YELL ACROSS THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT at the chef to bring gravy for his friend.  Then he kept yelling in this \"I Am A Big Shot\" glad - handing manner.  \"Chevalla! He loves it! It's Beautiful! Beautiful!\" (Pay attention to me! Notice Me! I am more important than you and your food.) \n\nBest I can figure, Cafe Bosna is a small enough pond that these guys can come here to feel like really big fish.   So just be aware that if you're going for an intimate, laid back experience you likely won't get it on weekend nights.  Because there is Invariably some version of The Guy.",

My rear skew was broken and he just used grease to make it look like it was replaced. The other manager said he must have over looked the broken piece, but I handed him the skew and the broken pieces. The chain on my EX 7 goes between my sprocket and frame. Now on a new bike I have weld that is getting eaten away on an thin aluminum tube that will not last for very long. The original chain broke because of this reason. All he did was put paint over scratch and not one person could tell what kind of work he did on my bike. Everyone in the bike shop just told me, \" I didn't do any of the work on your bike.\" My bike sat at the store for a whole week when they order the bike and I did not even get a call my bike has arrived. I had to go into the store to ask if my bike has arrived. I was told by a sales associate that they had no payments and interest for a year and all the manager had to say about that is, \"Obama passed some law.\" Also, I had a cable that the factory did not install correctly and I was charged by Reno Cycle and Fitness. If any of their buddy's come into store they will stop assisting you and hold long conversations with their friends.

  "text": "This message is to inform the owners of this bar that I will be pursuing legal action against the bar based on my experience with the workers on Saturday, December 28. I visited the bar and had no problems until early into the morning of the 29th, when a worker physically assaulted me on the premises. She had been offended by my behavior, and rather than addressing her frustrations with me in a professional manner, she approached me and began to shove me. I physically did not react; rather, I left the bar when asked. I expressed confusion at the physical confrontation and was met by the manager with the answer that customers can be expelled without reason, \"honey.\" His response was vague and sexist on top of his worker's inappropriate behavior.\n\nTo be transparent about the issue, I can tell you that the woman who attacked me had been frustrated by the fact that I was joining other karaoke singers on stage without signing up (I had asked the singers if they minded my joining them; they told me the more, the merrier). I was ultimately removed from the stage by the workers, who allowed other people on stage who weren't on the docket. I complied, and when I  later asked why others were allowed to crash the stage but I wasn't, the workers told me it was because the other people were friends. Because of this unfair treatment, I was angry and made an inappropriate gesture to express my frustration. Admittedly, my reaction was inappropriate-- but it was not violent. About five minutes later, the worker began to push me around. \n\nI understand that businesses reserve the right to refuse service to customers for their own reasons, but physical assault in this case was absolutely unnecessary and unwarranted. I have many witnesses who can attest to my nonviolence in this situation, and I hope that your establishment has video recordings to also back my claims.\n\nYour manager mentioned the bar had had a rough night. None of this had anything to do with me, and it's a completely unacceptable excuse for a working professional to lay hands on a paying customer.  The mature and professional way of handling this would have been for the worker to simply ask me to leave the bar, without any bullying or physical assault.",

  "text": "Well, well, well...Cunningham Restaurant Group strikes again!  They are on fire and setting the rest of Indy on fire with them.  First of all, I would pass this shut down, boarded up location everyday and say the same thing. \"This place would make a great business\" So, Livery proved me right.  It's a beautiful space, and the accents they've added to pay tribute to the history of the former horse livery works very well.  They have margaritas on draft, and I am a Debbie downer about that because honestly I've never had any on draft that I thought were worth the price until now.  The Livery came through with the margaritas.  We had the livery which is more of the standard and the carriage house which is more Texas, which is understating it because both are made with more than average ingredients.  Both were fantastic drinks! Upon being seated we were served some house made chicharones that were a nice crisp accented with a lime flavor that went well with our margaritas. I'm going to skip to the dessert because it blew us away!  The apple flan is a bit of culinary genius.  The texture was a silky smooth bit of creamy perfection served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side with a little garnish of a sweet cooked apple slice topped with I believe candied Marcona almonds. Yes, it tasted even better than it sounds.  They are making their desserts in house, and that includes the freaking ice cream.  I can't wait to see what kind of ice cream concoctions they come up with.  It's not my intention to take away from the small plates because we were not disappointed with our choices.  We shared the ceviche and the chicken empanadas.  Both were flavorful and delicious to the last bits. Lastly, Michael, Lee, and Phillip were all so very friendly and took the time to speak with us throughout our visit.  Throw all of this together with the very warm welcome we received as well as the very attentive service, and we had a spectacular Livery experience.",

There was a great happy hour crowd but not too packed where we could not grab a spot at the bar while we waited for our table.   The bartenders were great and the drinks quite good.

Choux paste with cheese amazing.  Loved them and the cobb salad quite large with an amazing dressing.  All worth while.

This review will focus on the convenient store aspect as opposed to the refueling services on offer.\n\nNo coconut water, but lots of sugary options for beverages, which was disheartening. They had the Advil I was in search of. GF couldn't open packaging, obviously not Valero's fault, but still, I won't let that fact spoil this review. \n\nI can see how some of the other reviewers claims of unfriendly employees came to be. Part of me also thinks they're just a touch too taciturn, but not gonna hate on that. To them I say \"mahalo\". \n\nMay refuel here later on today, if so, will report back.",

I pretty much have decided no more El Camino for awhile though since my last visit.\n\nI can make excuses for the service because it was the opening of the Piazza and a lot busier there than usual on a Saturday afternoon, but when I ordered the simple 2 eggs any way dish and never got my hash browns I was annoyed.  And then two minutes later when I noticed a black ant-like slug crawling on my plate I was downright grossed out. Yeah, I should have said something, but I was too bummed out from such a terrible brunch that I just wanted to leave. \n\nIf El Camino Real is empty-ish you should go since I have had good meals here before.

  "text": "So, this adorable little secret \" Fancy Parlor\" themed lounge was the 2nd stop on our anniversary night out in Philly. Finding this secret gem is no joke- if you are in the area of 20th and Chestnut, and its around 8 pm, you may see people looking at the GPS on their phones, walking back and forth in front of a spice shop.....this may be your first hint that you are in the right place! (because, there is NO sign!)\n\nUpon first impression, after patting myself on the back for finding this hidey-hole, all the while pretending that i knew it was there 'the entire time, duh' to my hubs, i am transported back in time to 1974 in my grandmothers 'front parlour' - couches with the wooden scrolls for arms, portraits of unknown family members leering down at me from the walls, and  dusty knick knacks of mysterious origin. \n\nWe are the 2nd couple waiting for a seat. The place is half full, and the hostess if completely perplexed on how to seat 2 groups of 2, that want to sit separately. She scans the room- loveseats, couches, club chairs, window seating....the options are endlessly charming, however beyond overwhelming for the hostess. After the other couple decides to cross the street for an entree ( 1 Tippling only serves munchies up to a certain time) the hostess heaved a great sigh of relief and sat us in a quiet corner overlooking the bar. \n\nThe waitress was in no hurry to 'get us fed and out' as some places are...when she finally took our order and we got our drinks -him a frothy 'Gentlemans Buck' and for me 'Dragons Tear'  (that Khaleesi drink!) we settled in for people watching, drinking,  and enjoying our time together. There is a relaxed \"homey, hang out awhile\" vibe to this place.\n\nThe decor matches the vibe of this joint. \nSit down, relax, drink, laugh....drink a bit more... really relax into\nthat comfy chair....oh, there's the waitress....well, ok maybe one more\nof those dragon tear things.....all served in fun vintage glasses.\n\nHubs and I were definitely the oldest in the room; it reeks of yuppie and Tory Burch, yet we had a great time drinking cocktails that went down way to easily, guessing what the stories behind some of the groupings were, and  showing the young-in's how to' date' after being married for 27 years.\n\n1 Tippling is like being welcomed into a new, yet familiar ritual..fancy cocktails before or after dinner at your aunts house. If you can find it, go.",

  "text": "UPDATE: Roberto, the owner reached out to me and showed true care and compassion for his business and customers. We had multiple discussions back and forth and I could tell he wanted to make my poor experience better and because of this, I told him I would give them another chance. I went in this morning and was greeted by a very nice gentleman behind the counter and then given some additional information about my order that I was unaware of by the barista, which was greatly appreciated. My order was also made quickly, even with me waiting behind another customer. My drink still wasn't very hot but definitely an improvement from this past weekend. I am happy to re-rate The Blind Tiger. Thank you Roberto! We should have more local businesses show this much care. \n\nInitial Review:\nI have been to The Blind Tiger on multiple occasions for everything from business meetings to pleasure like this morning. It has a great atmosphere inside and is in a convenient location. And after this mornings experience, along with multiple subpar visits, I had to write a review. The staff's attitude is always hit or miss on whether or not they are having a good day. I walked in this morning about 30 minutes after opening. It was quiet inside because it is an early Sunday morning. I said good morning to the girl who looked like she was mad at the world. Okay, we all have bad days and this wasn't the first time experiencing this there so I blew it off. I stated that I wanted my order to go and order two drinks. I asked about a pastry which was told it was a guava and cheese (one of my favorites) so I ordered one of those too. I sitting outside and walked back in after a few minutes to check on my order. I saw that the pastry was boxed up (which I appreciate the personal touch of their logo on the box) and then was told my first drink was ready. It wasn't in a to go cup so it had to be fixed. Instead of the barista handing it to me at the counter where I grabbed the pastry and was waiting, maybe three feet from the barista, she made me walk down to her to grab the cup instead of her walking to me. I walked back outside to wait on my second order, came back in a few minutes later to my next drink just being finished. I told the barista that the drink looked beautiful from the design she made on top and got zero response. And no have a good day, thank you, nothing. Instead the ladies were talking about what food they wanted to eat. Again, I was the only one who they were waiting on because it was a Sunday morning. I left and began drinking my coffee and it wasn't hot and my boyfriend's wasn't either, but it wasn't worth going back after all of that. And to top it all off, when I got home to eat the pastry, it didn't have any cheese in it and barely any guava and I threw part of it away. What blows my mind even more is that they hold training classes for those who want to learn more about coffee. They should focus more on making sure their staff is performing up to expectations as today they failed in almost every way possible.",

  "text": "Wow, I can't believe there are no reviews for this local chinese food joint as it's been popular since it opened in 1979.  Maybe the problem is that the name is listed incorrectly on Yelp.  It's name is Blue Quill Chinese Food (I've contacted Yelp to correct the name.)  Anyway, this is one of the few places where you can get delicious chinese food without MSG and even on their busiest nights we've never had to wait more than 30 mins to pick up our order (usually only 20 mins).  We always order the Beef with Brocolli and Black Bean Sauce, Chicken with Lemon Sauce, Ginger Chicken, Shrimp with Cashew Nuts and BBQ Pork Fried Rice.  Entrees are in the $10 range and everything we order consistently tastes good. Three entrees plus rice and the free wontons is enough to feed two people for a couple of meals.  10% off pick up orders over $27 and free Deep Fried Wontons if you spend more than a certain amount ($35, I think).  The only dishes we ever tried that we didn't care for were the Ginger Beef because the beef was too stringy to chew, but that could have just been an off night, and the Deep Friend Shrimp which (as with most chinese food places) was mostly batter and not enough shrimp.",

  "text": "First off, let me say that my husband and I have been going there about once a week since they opened several months ago. We always sit at the bar since we always go pretty late after work and there is never a wait to sit there. Our experience always depends on who is working behind the bar. As a restaurant owner, I am very understanding that sometimes people have a hard time separating what they are going through in their personal lives from their attitudes at work and it's not always fair to judge someone on a bad day. However, last night the bartender was so rude, all we wanted to do was leave and I wish we had sooner. We came in about 10:30, not realizing that they close at 11:00. There was no one else at the bar so it was just us she had to wait on. She never welcomed us or smiled once, keeping a look of disgust on her face even when I tried to make light conversation with her. She had waited on us before so I knew a little about her history and know that she is transferring to a new store in California soon. Trying to lighten things up I said, \"you're still here, you haven't left yet?\" just curious if she was still headed to Ca. She said, \"Unfortunately, I am\" and said nothing else. My husband asked for a second drink and she took his glass poured the drink and handed it back and took off to the kitchen. My husband quickly noticed that she didn't put any ice in it so we just sat and waited, when she finally came back my husband asked if he can have ice in his $7 drink and she added ice with no apologies. After a few minutes having had my food in front of me and just a minute or so after my husband had his food she asked me if I wanted a \"small box\" for my food. I don't think she had looked at my plate because I hadn't touched it and it was a large plate of food. I said, \"not yet, are you about to close?\" to which she replied, \"We closed seven minutes ago!\". I looked at my phone and realized that it was 11:07. Even though we had just gotten our food and she just poured a glass of wine at this point I had had enough and I was ready to leave. I said, \"I am really sorry. I am not sure if you remember but we are the people that own a couple restaurants and we tip well, I didn't realize that you close at 11:00. She replied, \"I don't care at all about the tip!\" I asked her for boxes and we hurried to get out of there. Overall, it was just a bad experience. I would give it one star but that's not fair to the other bartenders there that have been really nice. Most are really nice. I don't know what we did to deserve to be treated like that. Even if we came in 10 minutes to closing I would never expect that. As restaurant owners, we gladly welcome any customers until we are closed. I am sure of the time we came in because my mother called when we were on Mallory at 10:24 PM. I wish her good luck at the new store and hopefully this was just a onetime thing.",

Parking wasn't an issue for me but I can see it being a problem if this place is crowded. I got there right when they opened at 11 and was created by Katie and seated at the bar. The bartenders were extremely friendly and Personable! I told them about my eating quest and they wanted to hear about all the food I tried in the city. They were excited that I came here for the Boudreaux. I can say when this pizza came out I was blown away. It actually tastes better than it looked, and it looked amazing!

We explained to the waitress how other hibachi grills just give our food before they add the  extra sodium for everyone else. The waitress began to cut us off when we were talking and left us high and dry in the middle of our conversation to get the manager. We decided to leave at this point and went to the front where the manager was to pay for our drinks. One of the people in my party told the manager they never drank their drink. The manager who was equally rude gave us an attitude as we were signing our receipt for all drinks and said what do you expect us to do give it to someone else? We never implied they should give it to another. We were just unsatisfied with the surface and didn't drink anything and wanted to leave. Usually managers calm such situations instead of adding more fuel to the fire. Way to go! Yet another bad review that has been added to the many many many other bad reviews you guys have! \n\nPs we decided to overlook the bad reviews when we chose to dine at this restaurant.

(drink #1: facial toner, drink #2: salad dressing, drink #3: cough syrup)... definitely stick with beer or wine here. the food was ok. i had the turkey sandwich on pretzel bread and sweet potato fries - both were meh (and cold). food was much better when they first opened. sad when standards drop...

As a pizza connoisseur, I should have known better than to order from a chain,  especially when the yelp reviews lacked sufficient descriptions of the pizza (so many comment just say things like \"great pizza\" or \"good food\"). I ordered, online,  the special that included a one-topping pizza, bread sticks, and drinks and had it delivered;  my pizza was a thin-crust spicy pepperoni.  The good: The delivery was  relatively fast, the food was warm, pepperoni was plentiful, and the delivery guy was nice, which is why I can't give it a 2 or 1. The bad: the pizza tastes JUST LIKE domino's thin crust,  same texture, same cardboard-y-ness and the breadsticks tasted like big half-baked dough balls...I couldn't finish any of it. When I look at the reviews, I realize that I just must be a pizza snob. ..so many people like the pizza and have no complaints. Maybe these people are like my husband who just thinks \"a pizza is a pizza no matter where you go.\" Being from Chicago, I grew up with the gold mine of pizzas; I can't except that...the search continues!",

It comes with black beans and a side of plantains. Another in our party had the Ropa Vieja - shredded beef Cuban style. It too was delicious.  The sopapilla dessert was worth the calories.

  "text": "Many people judge a bar's staying power by the Cheers standard -- they want a place where everybody knows their name.\n\nAt M.L. Rose, nobody knows my name. I'll forgive them, though, because after I gorge myself on their juicy burger and luscious cheese fries, I don't even remember my name. In fact, that's probably why no one knows me -- my face is always buried in their food and subsequently covered in condiments.\n\nFor drink afficionados, I have two words: Beer. Selection. M.L. Rose has it. You'll find a deep lineup of bottles (and a few diverse drafts), as well as a delightful array of seasonal options. You can also treat yourself to some of the world's best beers, like Delirium Tremens and Chimay.\n\nIf you go to this grease factory, you must get the loaded cheese fries. Waffles, Wisconsin cheddar, whopping amounts of sour cream and chives...you'll love them and hate yourself afterward, especially if you've also ordered a burger. It'll be generously sized, too. \n\nIf you go to M.L. Rose and clean your plate, look for me. I'll be waiting with a high five, a beer and heartburn pills. I'm easy to find -- I'm the guy nobody knows.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is my favorite bar in town, but it doesn't get five stars. Two things hurt its rating: \n\n1) There aren't a ton of draft options. Bottles abound, but if you love a crisp draft, you'll get quality but not quantity. \n\n2) They recently turned the table-top back-room seating into booths with high dividers. It puts a damper on the atmosphere, especially during trivia night, when the interaction and people-watching used to be just as fun as the contest itself.\n\n**Second disclaimer: Go to Tuesday trivia. It's the best in town. You won't beat my team, but the second-place prize is pretty decent.",

  "text": "This was my second time eating Ethiopian food, so I definitely can't tell whether things are authentic. But what I can attest to is how pleased my taste buds were! \n\nMy boyfriend and I got the TA2, which is a large platter of pre-fixed 6 items, comprising of few different kinds of meat and veggies. We got the platter \"for one\" and thank goodness we did- the two of us struggled to finish it  (Be aware, the food is much more filling than it looks).  The goat was cooked well, and the beef was so tender and rich.  I loved the spices and unique flavors in each of the items.\n\nThe only negative thing I could think of was that the extra plates of injera were served at room temperature.  (At the place I first tried Ethiopian cuisine, they came out warm).  But it didn't ruin my experience since the food was so delicious anyways. \n\nOur waitress handled our large party like a champ and was willing to do separate checks. I know some people are a bit wary of eating only with your hands, so rest assured, they had hand sanitizers at every table!  The restaurant has a cozy ambiance, and with the Ethiopian decor and furnishings, you forget that you're in Indy.  It's a charming place, and I look forward to returning!",

Parking is good. No outdoor seating, which we love to use if the weather permits. Nice bar area to wait for your party and/or just to have drinks. The food was very good and the flavors blended well. If we had any complaints it's that the bathrooms are downstairs, they don't accept split checks under any circumstances and there was a big chalkboard sign for the elevator that said, 'elevator for use by those that need it only' (or something to that effect. A small sign on the wall would suffice. As it was, the people facing the sign said that it was very distracting due to its 'largeness'.",

It is family run with a few family photos on display around the dining space. The atmosphere is welcoming and filled with the smell of delicious food.\n\n    Our waitress was very kind and attentive but not over bearing, always refilling our glasses and checking to make sure we enjoyed our dishes. We ordered calamari to start and it came out with a dijon horseradish sauce, perfectly breaded and fried calamari (very tender and amazingly tangy and sweet with some lemon sauce) over a bed of spinach which was a nice touch. \n\n     I then ordered the Linguine Dolano as a half order as my friends ordered the baked lasagna and the Cavatelli Broccoli. The half order was just the right size, still a decent portion and at a great price (mine was only $6). My dish was delightful; pasta tossed in olive oil with pine nuts, sun dried tomato with fresh garlic and basil. I was in pasta paradise. It was simple, refreshing, and extremely good. My friends loved their dishes as well and we were all members of the clean plate club. \n\n        When our waitress came back to ask if there would be dessert we couldn't turn it down--it was my friends birthday after all. Once she knew this, she created a \"sample platter\" especially for us, on the house. She brought us in house made tiramisu, a chocolate chip filled cannoli, and a dish of ice cream that was pretty amazing--everyone's favorite (possibly chocolate chip with some sort of sweet fig possibly) And all of their ice cream is from Serendipity's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/serendipity-homemade-ice-cream-st-louis) so I must say kudos for also promoting a fellow local business. \n\nMamma Mia! This was an extremely satisfying meal and first visit to this charming cafe.",

We were quickly greeted and given menus and brought out our beverages.\n\nThey sell pizza by the slice, so I got 2 slices of pepperoni and my wife got a calzone. The calzone was huge, filled with ricotta cheese, pepperoni and served with a side of marinara. The pizza was good. It was a bit greasy, but you could hold it up without it sagging.\n\n The restaurant was clean, had a nice interior decor and didn't have the typical feel of a \"New York\" pizza joint. The prices are reasonable, service was good and friendly. For those reasons I rate it a bit higher than what I might based on food alone.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant.",

Fun, casual restaurant, with some old school arcade games (you can sit at the frogger table!). \n\nBut for a $10 sandwich, I'd really expect something on the side included. It was a thick sandwich, but on standard slices of white bread, so it looked so lonely not taking up much real estate in the basket. Yeah, you could at on a $4 potato salad or a drink, and soon enough you have a $17 meal. I'm not getting cheap, it just seemed chintzy to have a 4\"x5\" $10 sandwich all by itself. Give me a little something to munch on... Idk a couple grapes or a pickle or orange wedge or something. Or make a meal deal. \n\nThat said, there were a number of other menu items I'd like to try, I could be convinced to come back. The sandwich was enjoyable and filling.",

When we got there on a Friday evening there was only 1 person working the ticket counter and 3 of the self serve ticket machines were broken. There were people sitting on the counters, the people working didn't seem to care and acted as if we were inconveniencing them by ordering popcorn (which was way too salty and stale) and drinks. The bathroom was nasty. I have been in gas station bathrooms that were cleaner! When we handed the ticket taker our tickets he didn't direct us to the correct movie theater so we just wandered around until we found the correct one. The other movie goers were rude, talking through the movie and generally being disruptive. In a mostly empty theater I had no leg room as a couple sat right in front of us and leaned back the entire time. I will never ever go back to this theater. I have gone to second run theaters that were nicer and better maintained.  This was the worst movie theater I have experienced in over 20 years.",

So, one day when jonesing for sugar a fellow sugar addict and I headed off to the Bulk Barn.\n\nI purchased a few of my favorite snacks from the bins: licorice laces, gummy bears and sour cream puffs to name a few. My friend had an equally luscious load. I probably dropped about $40 and she $50. We couldn't  wait to get to the car to twist open a few bags and start the sugar rush and when we finally got the bags open wow.. what a disappointment!  My licorice laces were like eating the leather laces on my boots. I might have pulled off a crown trying to dislodge a gummy bear from my tooth and my girlfriend was dry heaving beside me. Need I say more.\n\nThoroughly disappointing. The most stale and vile junk food I have ever had the displeasure of eating. The bulk goods must have been in those bins for who knows how long ??? That coupled with the occassional grubby hands dipping into the bins to steal samples when no one was looking; disgusting. In fact it was so bad we threw it all in the garbage.\n\nI learned a costly but valuable lesson that day, and no,  it wasn't to stop eating so much junk food..lol, rather  \"To ensure freshness always buy your candy individually packaged\". \n\nBulk Barn gets a 5 popcorns down!",

When our dinner came, it was as prompt ...and delicious ...and wonderful as if we were the only ones there.\n\nAnd for the veggie roll lovers, they had a new roll on their specials board.  It was called the Yasai roll, I believe-- with delicious sweet potato straws in it.   Possibly their best veggie roll, yet.  I hope it finds a permanent home on the menu!\n\nSadly, they are closed for most of May for a remodel.  (I'd heard there was a small kitchen fire.)  I hope all of the staff was okay, and I can't wait for them to reopen.  \n\nYou made my birthday dinner perfect, Kampai, and I can't wait for my next delicious meal with you.",

Of course, the brews are top-notched and quality is evident in the clean taste of the beer, the clean glasses that gets served and the knowledge that the wait staff have about the beers.  I was there with my wife, my 6 month old daughter, and my sister in law.  We had numerous questions about the beers.  Our waiter, Ed, was extremely courteous, patient, and funny in a natural, easygoing manner.  That wasn't the thing that stood out from my experience at Iron Hill.  Our waiter went out of his way to get my 6 month old daughter a bowl of mashed sweet potatoes despite it not being on the menu.  Another member of the waitstaff told us it wasn't possible, but our waiter convinced the kitchen to make it for us even though it's not a complicated dish and that the sweet potatoes are already there for the sweet potatoes fries, which IS on the menu.  It's moments like this that makes an establishment stand out in my mind because they made my daughter feel comfortable and they seem extremely understanding of parents and infants.  If that wasn't it, I forgot my credit card and some of my daughter's things when we left.  They kept everything safe for me when I returned to get it.  No attitudes and no strange looks.  The folks are well trained in restaurant service and are as professional as it gets.  Kudos to the whole team there.  We will be returning soon.",

The setup is very similar to the Quiznos that was there before, so not sure why it took them so long to open.\nI got the Habanero Burrito with black beans and carnitas and my boyfriend got the Carnitas Burrito.  The food came quickly and you get a little chips and salsa while you wait (the burritos also come with chips).  There were two big problems with the burritos: 1) all of the cheese, sour cream, and guacamole were on one side and the rice, beans, and meat were all on the other.  So there was no way to get a bite with everything in it.  I would have liked the ingredients to be more evenly dispersed throughout the burrito.  2) the rice was seriously undercooked.  Every bite had several crunchy grains, but along with some perfectly cooked grains. It's like one batch of good rice got mixed in with a batch of undercooked rice.  I can get over the uneven-ness of the ingredients, but it's pretty hard to get over crunchy rice.  The flavor of the burritos was pretty good though outside of those two things.\nThe salsa is perfectly spicy, but be sure you have something to wash it down with, especially the habanero salsa.  The servings are also really big.  We had a late lunch and therefore had an even later dinner because we were STUFFED.\nI didn't notice the tamale and pupusa menu (they are behind the cash register, separate from the main menu that you see when you first walk in). I definitely have to come back to try both of these.",

The servers were really out of sync and do not believe in team work. I felt one waiter was taking on way more than he should've been handling. The crowd is as expected in this area on a late Friday evening and a mini confrontation took place adding to the unhappy vibe of this place. All I wanted was a chocolate shake and that took almost 30 minutes to come out supposedly because they were out of whipped cream.. however there was no whipped cream on my shake when it finally came out. Onion rings and BLT sandwich were extremely average if even that.. Tables were extremely sticky. Gah! definitely not the Johnny Rockets from back in California where  my SO and I had our first date.",

Nothing to write home about, but good. my bff did get an obscure roll - I can't remember the name of it for the life of me but it looked like five rolls, stuck together in the shape of a flower, were deep fried toget and then cut off as large, flower shaped slices. It was weird. And impossible to eat. And just weird. \n\nThe service was good, again, nothing spectacular or memorable.

As a visitor from the south, I was surprised to see grits on the menu (but didn't try them). They have Tabasco sauce, too. A great addition to any breakfast. In my humble, Louisiana influenced opinion. \n\nThe scrapple was fried super crispy and piping hot.  It's sliced pretty thin and almost all crust. Could be a little thicker. Everything was hot and fresh cooked. Eggs in the omelette were just a little overdone, but not yet rubbery. \"Home fries\" are good, with a crispy crust, but more a pile of potatoes somewhere between mashed and small chunks. But still pretty good. \n\nThe only distraction here is the bickering among the staff. With an open kitchen, there's just no place to hide. \n\nOverall, a good, standard diner with a good breakfast.

They also took reservations and that was a bonus because we didn't know how busy it would be on a Friday evening with a game. We got seated right away (5:45pm) and it was not busy at all but just after 6p the place started to get busy. Our server was really nice and made sure our drinks were always filled. It did not take long to get our food either. \n\nWe got the Beer Cheese Tots for our stater and this was really good. The bacon pieces were especially delicious. My husband had the Buffalo Chicken Burger. This is ground chicken with buffalo sauce. Which I really loved the idea because I was worried it would be more of a fried chicken sandwich. He also got the zucchini straws. The straws were so-so and not something we would order again but the garlic black pepper aioli that comes with the straws was absolutely delicious. The burger was just ok. It was a bit plain for me and could have used more buffalo sauce. There were some toppings missing that were listed on the menu and not a lot of the gorgonzola aioli on the burger. I got the Stanford which is their turkey burger and again kind of plain. Again there was hardly any of the tarragon mayo. The meat just didn't seem seasoned. To be fair we probably could have asked for more aioli and gotten some on the side but I hardly to do that when a restaurant is busy. If it's on the menu then it should be on the burger. I had the caesar salad as my side which is just your basic side salad. Overall I wasn't very impressed. I would probably go back just for convenience and to try one of the beef burgers but it wouldn't be something I was necessarily looking forward too after this first experience.",

Greek salad sort of bland and sterile too. The counter-ordering arrangement is nice and casual, but gets a bit chaotic the more people are waiting. So overall okay.",

  "text": "I've been to this place on several locations & one thing I can say about it is \"Consistent\". The food is average, maybe a little better than some of the other chain restaurants out there... but most of the stuff is shipped and then they try to put a homemade twist on it.... I've had worse, but I've had better... I will say that the Blue Cheese Chips & Wings were better than the 3 stars I gave the place, but the pizza was average... \n\nThe service is hit & miss. You either get a good one who takes good care of you, or one that is always slow with your orders and really not that personable... But you get what you pay for. \n\nI do think they need to do a little remodeling. The place is dive bar charmy, but really dated.... don't get me wrong, I like dive bar charmy, but not from the 70's (and I do know that's my opinion only).",

  "text": "I finally went to Ghini's and now will be a repeat customer!  My friend MB suggested we have lunch at Ghini's and I was totally down with the idea. For quite some time, I have been hearing good things about this little cafe from a mass amount of fellow foodie friends and simply hadn't gotten around to trying it.  \nGhini's is a darling little cafe with quaint indoor seating and a large patio in front.  Since the weather was nice, we debated indoors or outdoors but eventually decided indoors. They have a phenomenal drink menu.  It is one of those menus that I have to narrow it down to 4-5 drinks and then decide. So many yummy coffee drinks on their menu!  I was in the mood for something refreshing and so I went with an Orangina.  Next trip, I will be trying the chocolate hazelnut mocha. \nLots of deliciousness is on their lunch menu and again comes the hard part of making a decision. MB has been to Ghini's on many occasions and raved about their Croque Madame.   Eventually, we both decided on soup and salad.  I had the  baby field greens, which were lovely and they had the perfect amount of dressing. We each had the French onion soup, which was so flavorful and pretty much perfection.  \nLa Baguette Bakery is inside and we made a quick stop there on our way out to admire all the pastries, breads, tarts and cookies!  MB bought chocolate croissants and I purchased a big sugar cookie loaded with sprinkles as a treat for my favorite kid.  He shared a bite with me and it may have been the BEST sugar cookie I've encountered.  \nI love it when you leave a restaurant feeling totally and completely blissed out by the experience, which is exactly how I left Ghini's.",

I even went on Christmas last year. \n\nThe full rundown: \n\n-All of the tables are a free-for-all, so if it is crowded, you're kind of out of luck. I don't really have that vulture instinct in me, so if there aren't any tables, I head out. \n\n-Service is super hit or miss. Sometimes super fast. Sometimes super slow. \n\n-Avoid the nachos and quesadillas! Not worth it. Their guac is pretty good, though. \n\n-Burgers are decent. Not the best in the city but by no means the worst either. The toppings options are top notch. \n\n-Great beer selection! \n\n-Great atmosphere! Kind of eclectic, kind of sporty, kind of bro-y, kind of hip. Meets lots of demographics without trying too hard or seeming scattered. \n\n-The MAIN reason to go to ML Rose: THE WAFFLE FRIES.  Specifically, the loaded or the bleu cheese+bacon. They are worth it. My friend and I usually get a burger with slaw as our side then split a large order of fries. It's the best decision, I promise.",

  "text": "An unimpressive breakfast establishment with mediocre service and food.\n\nMy friends and I wanted to find a sit-down breakfast joint that opened early enough for us to chow down on good food before my friend had to go to work. After browsing through Yelp, it seemed like Ghini's was the only candidate nearby. Although their door and website state that they opened at 6:30am, they seemed to be running late and didn't open until 6:45am. We had to seat ourselves and waited on a server for a few minutes. Eventually, our waiter came and, being slightly flustered, took our orders quickly. I was surprised to find that you can't order every single pastry from the bakery display on the other end of the cafe (apparently, they're separate businesses?) For example, you can only order plain croissants if you sit at a table, but you can choose from a variety of croissants if you walk yourself over to the pastry counter (strange). Anyway, I ordered the Egg Provençal with scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast. It really did seem like I had an overcooked order of 6 eggs - just a huge portion off rubbery sadness! (You might be better off ordering the eggs over easy).  The toast was overly buttered as well, which is fine if you like it that way. The only good thing I had was their cafe au lait, which was served in a huge mug. My friend had the breakfast sandwich, and she thought it was decent. With just a few tweaks, Ghini's can be great, but I'm afraid I'd go elsewhere for breakfast or brunch.",

Not a class Philly steak sandwich, but very tasty and moist and juicy. Yum!\n\nGood beer selection too! Service is friendly and attentive - yay!\n\nI recommend as a sports bar or tavern, if you're thirsty and hungry for pub fare. It's good quality.",

The free breakfast was over crowded and it took us nearly 15 minutes before we could get a clean fork. I would have rather paid for breakfast than endure that! The bussers were practically throwing dishes down, clearly not enjoying themselves in the slightest bit. The pool is more of small whirl pool with maybe 10 seats and most of it is shaded, so laying by the pool wasn't even an option. I would never stay here again.",

Came here for dinner with a friend using a Groupon that included one starter, two sandwiches/burgers and one dessert. \n\nGuacamole -- you could definitely tell that it was made fresh to order as they claim on the menu, but it was SO bland. There were barely any red onions, cilantro or jalapeno in it, and it looked and tasted like mashed up avocados.\n\nCowboy Burger -- this was pretty good. The brioche bun was toasted nicely and didn't get soggy. The patty was thick and cooked medium, which is what I asked for. Even though it had melted cheese, barbecue sauce, bacon and an onion ring, it didn't feel overly greasy. It came with fries which there were a TON of. I didn't finish it because I wanted to leave room for dessert. \n\nMile-High Apple Pie -- this is ginormous! It was served warm with vanilla ice cream. Crust was nice. Overall it was yummy. But after a while I got tired of eating all those apples so I think I prefer a regular not-mile-high apple pie. \n\nEven though they have more than just ice cream (ha), that's probably the only thing I'd come back for.",

I am from Denver and I am attending school at Tulane in the fall. While at one of the school's incoming freshman events I decided to I was going to get a tattoo. I did very little research into the shop artist etc (rookie move but it paid off) I just knew I did not want a tattoo from a tourist shop on bourbon street on in the French quarter. So I headed with my dad (I'm only 17) to this shop. I called around 11 pm asking if there was any availability, which there was, so we walked over. I talked to Nikki for all of 5 minutes before she knew exactly what I wanted. She was incredibly friendly and cooperative. The shop is cash only (which we did not realize prior, but should have...as that's the way most parlor safe...again I'm a rookie) and immediately did not have the correct amount of cash for the tattoo let alone a tip. However she was more than happy to do the work anyways. My lucky day because she did an incredible job...she is a phenomenal artist!!!!\nWe flew home in the morning so we mailed her a tip and the amount for the rest of the tattoo from the hotel (hopefully she received it...mailing money is far from a guarantee)\nAnyways, I can not wait to come back here...and bring some other students along with. Still makes me excited speaking about it to this day!",

  "text": "The only reason why the rating isn't lower is that dinner (in person) at Tre Lune can be a really nice experience. The service and food quality can be top notch.\n\nOrdering take out is another experience altogether.\n\nSure ordering for pickup automatically excludes us from getting a level of service that is often expected from a Montecito restaurant but we didn't realize that ordering takeout also meant that we would be subject to huge swings of food quality/consistency. After all isn't food quality the one thing that a restaurant can exhibit huge amounts of control over?\n\nThe latest takeout experience involved ordering Garganelli with chicken and mushrooms. One order excluded the chicken and the other order assumed that we would enjoy having the chicken added as an after thought - on top of the dish as if it were an over easy egg. We have pictures of the incredibly appetizing meal (being facetious of course) but there doesn't appear to be a way to post those while writing this review. Keep in mind the cost of the meal is the same for takeout or dine in.  The same price applies even when no chicken or mushrooms are added.\n\nOur advice - don't order takeout at Tre Lune.  If you are in pinch and find yourself looking over the menu, then place your order and clear your calendar just in case you need to stick around the restaurant while your dish is being remade the correct way.\n\nPS. And no, these are not the only examples.  There are others but clearly we didn't learn our lesson and continued ordering.  The last experience may have sealed the deal for a long while.",

She came back to tell me that the manager said \"It seemed fine to her.\" She did not offer to make me something else or do anything to fix this terrible drink. Once it was time to pay I told our waitress I would prefer not to pay for the drinks we didnt touch. The manager came over and asked what the issue was. She continued to argue the drinks were okay. (I probably drink way too many cocktails and these were NOT okay.) After arguing with her, she finally agreed to take them off the bill. This woman came back to the table AGAIN just to say the taps were fine. I was personally insulted and will make sure I tell ALL my friends in the Broad Ripple area to stay clear of this place.",

They are known for their brisket but personally I have found it to be a bit dry and do not care for it -- I would stick with their pulled pork and delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs.  I am a big fan of their sauce more so than other joints, and prefer their mac 'n' cheese over both Edley's and Peg Leg.  If you save room, the Pecan Pie is life-altering.

When I arrived, with the truck I had just driven alone from NC to Tucson that was full of furniture, I was told I did not reserve climate controlled. The two ladies in the office-Aysha and I'm not sure the other one's name that was there at the time-acted like they had no idea of anything at all or what went wrong. They offered to let me take a unit twice as large (much larger than I needed), at twice the price. \n\nI drove to the other location to speak in person with the person who I had spoken with on the phone to make the reservation. Even though we had said climate controlled multiple times, I thought perhaps he had made a mistake on the reservation and could help me out. (Other than offering me that unit at twice the price or a unit too small for my stuff, this location wouldn't offer anything.) \n\nWhen I arrived, he said he remembered me and double checked my reservation...confirming, as I thought, that it was for climate controlled. When he called the Houghton location, they told him that when my reservation was made, they came back with another customer who wanted a climate controlled unit and gave her mine. At that time, they changed my reservation.\n\nSo not only did they \n1. Give away a unit for which I had a confirmed reservation, but they also\n2. Changed my reservation without notifying me. \n3. Lied to me about my reservation and pretended they knew nothing when both of them were clearly perfectly aware of what they had done.\n4. Offered nothing but to make me pay double for a year's worth of storage to pay them for lying to me and taking away my reservation. \n\nHonestly, to the poster below, if you were the end of this May, it makes me wonder if my reserved unit is the one that suddenly became available. I did not arrive outside of my reservation window (came in the same day it was made) and didn't cancel it or do anything that would have made it available, but it was given to another customer.",

The sweets just didn't look all that great and without prices listed I was concerned I would walk out with over $20 for lunch and I drank water.  I don't mind $12 for lunch I do it at Patachou for their chicken salad but it is a nice size sandwich and I usually get two meals out of it.  It is also really good.  The service was also awful.  For the first time I left only a 10% tip.  When I eat alone I tend to get crappy service almost every place I eat and that stinks.  I don't see myself going back.",

  "text": "After having been married in Greece, Greek food always holds a special place in my heart and stomach.  Really tasty souvlaki and the Greek fries with oregano and feta were yum.  Staying authentic, there's grilled octopus if you're feeling adventurous.  Interior of the restaurant is full of creative murals; I especially like the one on the outside saying \"Welcome to the Athens of the South\", a fun tie-in to the Greek-ness.  Looked to be using authentically Greek ingredients, or at least ones which have Greek characters on them!  Nice patio area out back that we'll be sure to check out on a return visit.  Server seemed a little spacey, but otherwise a good, fresh casual meal.",

  "text": "I took my two daughters(1 yr & 3yr) here this week with my cousins and their children and had the most wonderful time. We did the hayride and paid for the play area. We got there at 10AM and left  by 1:30, but I felt like we could have spent so much more time enjoying all the activities. First the hayride- Farmer Doug was so sweet and patient with our group (7 kids 3 & under!) and took time to explain fun facts about the crops and show the girls how to pick corn. The kids were so attentive and excited to see what he would show them next. There was so much to pick and the corn and tomatoes were delicious!\n\nThe play space- we fed the animals and played on the playground. There was lots to do for kids of all sizes. We didn't bring bathing suits so we skipped the splash pad, but I'll be back for that!\n\nThe food- maybe the only thing that would make me give it 4 stars, but I didn't have high expectations for hot dogs and chicken fingers. The cider donuts were a bit of a disappointment. They don't come out hot and fresh, but we're in case waiting. Very apple tasting and large in size, not my favorite and I would skip them next time.",

  "text": "Come for the food, tolerate the service.\n\nMuriel's wasn't our first choice, but it was a convenient choice. Wanting to do a fun, french quarter brunch with the family on Sunday, we decided to trek in from Arabi to try and get a spot at Stanley's. Unfortunately, Stanley's does not take reservations and had a 2 hour wait at 1:00 for brunch. Hungry and lacking patience, we sidestepped our way over to Muriel's Jackson Square.\n\nFirst, let me talk about one of the highlights of our experience. The building itself is fantastico. There are beautiful sky lights that let sunshine just pour into the restaurant. This is a plus. Unsurprisingly, the bar is in a dark, dank corner that was a high-traffic area. Meaning, if you weren't sitting down at the bar, servers were jostling their way by you every few minutes.\n\nThe wait caused us to hang out at the dark, dank, not so happy bar area.\n\nNow, hanging out at this bar wouldn't have been so bad if the service were a little better. Ordering drinks for our group proved to be a herculean task. Both my cousin and my wife tried numerous times to get the attention of the two bartenders, one who was working quickly, the other who was working like she could care less that she was there. Time after time, the bartenders would look passed the younger, less wealthy looking women and instead, take the orders of older patrons. My cousin was even on the end of a snide comment by one of the bartenders. Eventually, we received our drinks. The verdict? Good, but not worth the wait.\n\nBy the time we got our drinks, almost 45 minutes after sitting at the bar, it was time to take our seats. At this point, the service improved marginally. Our drink guy was friendly and quick to take our drink orders. Our waitress (I'm unsure if she even bothered to introduce herself) was a bit awkward. So what saves this place? The food. The brunch food was damn good. I got the Imperial Crab as an appetizer, which had tons of crab meat and a light breading, and the shrimp and grits as my main. The crab was moist, hot, and just downright tasty. The shrimp and grits were also well above average, with the grits being some of the best grits I have ever had. My wife ordered a bacon/cheese tart type of thing that was also quite good, especially when paired with the fresh fruit. 2-star service is rescued by 4-star food. \n\nThe service issues just got more awkward during the bill. We had split the check three ways (that is their limit), so my friend was on my tab with my wife. He put down $40 to cover his meal, and we put the rest on the credit card. Our waitress? Despite the fact that we split our check, she assumed the $40 was the tip for the entire table. We then had to awkwardly tell her that no, that was to be applied toward the bill. We tipped on the card. If I hadn't caught this snafu, we would have paid $40 more than we intended to. \n\nConsensus: I'd go back, but only if I was getting takeout.",

  "text": "People rave about this place and the Dan Dan Noodles. They proudly display a banner that says \"CNN Rated one of the Top 50 Chinese Restaurants in the US\". I guess maybe the flagship location is Manayunk which could be better than Exton. I've been to Exton and Royersford several times and it does not impress me like I hoped it would. I keep going back though hoping things will turn around. I should probably mention I lived in two different cities in China for over 6 months each and have a good understanding of authentic cuisine. The Dan Dan Noodles just do not do it for me. I think people rave about them because no other chinese restaurant around has a dish like this, so maybe it is new to them? The dumplings are good, but totally not authentic at all. And most recently I was here and the menu seemed a bit different. The entree's was just a list of maybe 12 - 16 different 'styles' of food which I thought was a very odd way to present your menu. If you do decide to go, you should definitely try the eggplant. This was good enough to make me want to come back again and get that with something new.",

I own a handmade business and sell vintage clothing so I wanted take time to scout some southern shops for charming pieces to add to my collection. I loved the vast selection here, but I did find that some of the prices were higher than they should have been on certain clothing items, particularly ones that still had tags on them. I totally understand that NWT items should cost more because they haven't been worn, but some of the pricing was more than you would pay at a retail store. Other than that, I thought it was a great experience and the gal at the cashier counter was super friendly. I really appreciate good customer service and I can say that we received great service here. We really enjoyed searching through the shop and part of the fun of thrifting is hunting for those special pieces. Every thrift store piece has history, so it's neat to look through things that have stories behind them, although we don't always know what they are. I definitely could have spent hours browsing the store, but we had to get back on the road. Highly recommend this shop for thrift store enthusiasts.",

The process takes time but it went by really fast, the owner is very easy to talk to and is very down to earth. I ended up getting a groupon from a friend as a gift for another eyelash place..let's just say I will never go anywhere else for eyelash extensions in Tucson. They really look amazing! The massage therapist on staff is really really good too, best massage I've ever had. I would highly recommend this business for any of your spa needs.",

  "text": "My review: Mizu is pretty good and relatively cheap (for sushi)\n\nThis is a rant to the first guy to review Mizu.\n\nTo sum up your review: I'm from California and sushi sucks in St. Louis because you don't live near an ocean.\n\nMan do I love those, thanks Eli for your insightful look into how you'rre from California and that makes you cool and a sushi expert, by the way, what is Lawndale, CA anyway? \n\nI feel I can comment on this as I lived by the ocean in CA for years so I once too was cool and knew the taste of magical California sushi. Let's take a look at the fish you ordered Eli, how many of those fish  came off the docks in Lawndale? Wait Lawndale doesn't have docks, but regardless, looks like none to maybe one, so that awesome sushi you're eating in Lawndale, is yes, wait for it..the same freaking fish flown in! You see, they have these things called planes now, what they do is, they load a plane to a glitzy metropolis called Lawndale and another for St Louis. Our plane probably arrives a few hours later, so you do have us there.  Some of the best sushi restaurants are in NYC (I've been to this magical place) and guess what pal, they ain't pulling those fish out of the Hudson River.\n\nTo be fair, I have no basis on Lawndale sushi, because I have never been to Lawndale, let alone hear of Lawndale. I work in Santa Monica some times, perhaps I will avoid those places to try the magical Lawndale Sushi that tastes like you're eating it out of Zeus' butthole.\n\nPerhaps you can bring that cool yellow hat, I am very interested in it as my sister loved Strawberry Shortcake and it seems you shop at the same hat shop as her. I guess it must be a California store.",

Seriously...where else in Nashville (or the world, for that matter) can you get two for one drafts, bottles and margaritas ALWAYS?\n\nBut aside from the all-day-everyday drink specials (as if I'd need more of an incentive), El Jaliciense has some pretty delicious and authentic Mexican cuisine.  A pretty large portion of the staff at this place speaks fragmented English if any at all, but they're still sweet as pie and pretty fast.  They have the lunch and dinner specials typical of any Tex-Mex restaurant you'll come across, and prices are pretty typical.\n\nEl Jaliciense is tucked away in a strip mall on Charlotte, and had it not been recommended to me a couple months back, I never would have given it a chance.  It's a relatively small place with a couple of TVs and about a dozen booths, but it's a great place to dine with your crew.  I just had a few midday beers with some friends there.\n\nI got the number one special (two enchiladas, a taco and rice) with four beers (for the price of two), and I only paid about $12 before tip.  It just doesn't get any better than that.  I would have recommended this place sooner, but I couldn't find anything about it online and had to track it down again to determine the address.

First, they have beautifully renovated a building that has been around a while. I could not believe how nice the decor was and the restaurant is super clean. My husband had the pulled pork and I had the ribs. My husband is something of a BBQ connoisseur and he raved about his sandwich. My ribs were smoky and perfect even without sauce, but you should find at least one of their sauce options to your taste. I had the Mac & cheese and smoky green beans. I enjoyed them both and was pleasantly surprised that the green beans were still bright green (told myself I was eating healthy!). As for price, I am a big believer in paying a little extra for quality and food made with care. Circle S certainly not only meets this criteria, but does so incredibly well.",

Everything looked dried out and old.  We were there on a Sunday morning right when they opened so I expected a little more from the salad bar.  They had iced tea but it came from a machine and tasted terrible.  No wonder you can get a coupon for $0.99 meal when you buy a $17 game card.  The food was worth about $0.99.  The game room was just what you would expect - loud and obnoxious.  The kids had fun and that's why we went but honestly I would never go back and if I ever do I won't be eating the food.",

Our waitress informed us that full breakfast would not be available until 9:00. The music was insanely loud until about 8:30, when they turned it down. We were the only 3 people there for a while, so perhaps the music was up loud for the employees to enjoy? We could barely hear each other talk, and it was way too early for that loud of music for me. The coffee, however, was phenomenal. It was definitely the best, most fresh, and most balanced coffee I have ever had from anywhere. I made plans to stop by on my way to Lilly to grab a coffee some morning. The pastries were very unique. I am not too adventurous when it comes to food, so I'm probably not the best judge of the overall menu, but I really liked the tres leche pastry - bread pudding and beer. Very sweet and lightly tangy. From glancing at the breakfast menu, it was a little weird for my tastes, but again, I am conservative when it comes to food. I will definitely try to swing by and grab a coffee to go sometime, but I don't plan to try and eat in here anytime soon.",

  "text": "Moto attempts to bring modern Italian cooking to Nashville. Unfortunately the food is underwhelming and poorly cooked. \n\nEach dish we tried had something off about it. \n\nThe Calamari was over-breaded and served with tartar sauce. The tartar sauce must have been inspired by the time Rome invaded Great Britain . I'm pretty sure tartar sauce is not an italian specialty. \n\nThe Burata was flavorful once it warmed up. It was pre-plated and stored in the refrigerator making it too cold until it sat a bit.  The cold also made the croutons unappetizing. \n\nThe Black Spaghetti was oily and had very little lobster. Three small pieces, less than 2oz.\n\nThe Chicken Piccata was bathed in butter,  drowning out any lemon flavor.\n\nThe Polenta fries were too salty to eat. \n\nThe waiter was professional, and was very helpful pointing point out that Mozzarella was a \"cheese\". Oh yes, Gotcha. \n\nPerhaps the main chef left for the night and the sous chef was filling in. It was 1015pm on a Saturday and empty. And no, they were not playing The Cure. \n\nOn an up note, the wine list was great and the service was quick and friendly. \n\nMy suggestion, pass on Moto and try Coco's or City House.",

I had to wait a bit for seating at dinner time, which is a great thing to see them succeeding. \n\nThe service was a tad bit off, but they are new and they were packed, so I will give them a break. I'm sure it will get better with time. More importantly, the staff was very pleasant, the margaritas were delicious as was the food.  The prices were also very fair. \n\nThe only suggestion I would have is their chips are thick corn chips that are obviously out of a bag.

  "text": "I'm glad that I finally ended my term here. \n\nWhen I first signed up, they made me participate in a \"free training course\" so that I knew how to use the facilities properly. It was a great workout, but turns out it was just a sales pitch for me to sign up for a personal trainer. I was just out of college at the time and obviously did not have money for that sort of thing, but the guy made me feel really bad for choosing to just sign up for a regular membership.\n\nIn the beginning of my membership here, they also had almost an entire room meant for stretching out on mats. Within the past year, they changed it to a weight room and there is barely any room for stretching anymore. If the 3 mats they have are full, you can try stretching on the turf area, but if you are not a Thrive member you are not technically allowed to.\n\nParking here is impossible. If you plan on driving here, don't even think about it. There are about 12 parking spots for well over 300 members that go to his gym. \n\nThere was a lot of turnover among staff in the 2 years I went here, but for the most part they were friendly. Facilities were clean for the most part and the sauna was a nice perk. I was worried about ending my membership here because of all of the horror stories I have read on Yelp, but it was a very simple cancellation process with no fees or hassle.",

And the ones they processed have all been denied for various reasons, mostly that documents are missing.\n\nThis reason is even given after the doctors office sent all the documents to the insurance groups head office and I have gotten a confirmation of the receipt of those documents.\n\nDon't expect this company to be there for you! You're just wasting your money.\n\nI even talked on the phone to their costumer service while being in the hospital for further examinations and it took them about a week after that to approve a pre-certification for X-Ray/MRT. 1 week!!!\n\nLuckily my injury wasn't as time sensitive as some can be because it would be critical with their speed of working to get help (most hospitals and doctors only treat after approval for coverage from the insurance company).\n\nAnd after you got your treatments this company will try EVERYTHING to postpone your claims and on top deny them so they don't have to cover for them.\n\nAfter my experience with them I'm 100% sure that all positive feedback for this company is fake. I should have read the ones here before signing with them. Being from Europe I have never experienced an insurance company working like them. This is like from a bad movie where in the end the patients have to sue the insurance company to get to their right.\n\nDon't even think about getting coverage here, because even if you pay for one you will not be covered or denied coverage for any fake reason they can find.\n\nI can already see my claims going to a lawyer and luckily i have proof for everything (from coverage to non-pre-existing conditions). It will still be a headache and not what anybody should deal with.\n\nNot an insurance company to trust!",

However, a very large group was using their back private area therefore the available tables in the front room were very deceiving to the expected wait times. Waves and waves of plates were taken to this apparently huge group in the back before we realized what was going on. This of course led to us waiting almost an hour for our two plates. In a properly run establishment the decision should be made to not allow more and more patrons to take a seat and order until a reasonable wait time is to be expected. We would have even been ok with them having given us a warning as we sat that wait times were going to be much longer than expected. Very easy step to take. The servers were clearly overworked due to managements bonehead decision to allow customers to continue to sit. \nEventually our food did come but it wasn't worth an hour wait. We wanted to like this, but bad customer flow management left a bad taste in my mouth.\n \nSuper Easy fix guys! Don't seat people when the wait is going to be that long.",

I like the atmosphere of the place.  It had a nice setting but it wasn't pretentious.  There were all sorts of people there which is always nice. The service was great!  Our waitress was attentive and gave great recommendations.  \n\nNow the food:\nThe fresh oysters were delicious.  I've never had them before and am still on the fence about it overall, but I'll admit they were pretty fresh tasting.  My parents loved it since my mom food orgasm-ed pretty loudly with every bite (pretty gross if you ask me).  I especially like that they had some sort of a wasabi sauce that went with it. \n\nI ordered the etouffee, which was good but it wasn't really anything to write home about.  My mom had the shrimp and grits, which I thought were fantastic but she thought was way too salty.  My dad had the express meal (Sunday was some veal dish with a cup of crab & corn soup).  The soup was really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of the red sauce base and this was kind of in between.  He said he like the veal dish but he will also eat anything and is a man of little to no words - so take that however you want.\n\nOverall, I liked the food and the ambiance of the place.  I was a little disappointed to see that for the price, the portions were tiny.  I know \"nicer\" restaurants always have smaller portions, but still, I guess I like having yummy leftovers.  I think I'd come back here but maybe try some of the other dishes and definitely to try those oysters.",

So to have a meal you really need the medium and large meals.  One of the medium meals I had was just under $8 and the other large was just under $13.  \n\nPersonally at that price for the large, I would rather go to Ciccio Cali and get myself a hot and spicy tuna bowel with spaghetti squash or kale.  The snacks and desserts were okay tasting and I could see if you had a sweet tooth these may be healthier options. \n\nI think if you do not cook at all and don't know how to find held thy meals eating out this may be a good option, every now and again.  But spending almost $900 upfront for $1000 in meals as a member doesn't seem like a good option. \n\nAs someone who cooks, I know I can make similar health meals for 1/4 of the price since fresh groceries from Publix runs me about $60 per week.\n\nBottom Line: Not a good value for the money",

  "text": "I have seen that a lot of yelpers compare this to Vegas. Let's just say there is no comparison to the glitz and glamour of Vegas, so let's just stop doing that, ok?\n\nFor a Tucson, AZ casino, this is where it's at. They have a nicer new hotel and several restaurants. Their pool could stand to be kid-free, but it is still nice. As for gambling, they do have a nice selection of new slots and a bunch of tables. I have never had to wait to play.\n\nI have been to this casino several times, most recent being last night. A few friends and I have gone there to play bingo for their Thursday night Club Sol appreciation night. Thursday nights you get 20% off bingo with your Club Sol Card. To get a Club Sol card you just go to card services, show them your id, and you get a free card. Each time you go to the casino, you can enter into contests by just sliding your card at the kiosks, and you get rewards points and discounts. When I signed up, I also got $10.00 in free play. yay!\n\nBingo is fun, there are always a lot of people, be sure to sit in the non-smoking section if you don't care to get lung cancer. This plays fills up, so get there early. There are complimentary soft drinks, and also a snack bar with some baseball-like concessions.\n\nI have stayed at the hotel before, our Ad2 Tucson organization held our ADstravaganza event there a couple of years ago. The event staff did an outstanding job and we loved the space by the pool. We stayed over night, it was nice, but probably not the nicest place in Tucson if you are looking to relax. It was pretty loud, and if I hadn't have passed out from drinking, I might have had a problem.\n\nI have also eaten at the PY Steakhouse, which I will review separately.",

The free massage was nice and the techs were pleasant. \n\nThe problem is that I requested a glitter on just my ring fingers and the tech insisted on using regular nail polish over the gel color but under the gel topcoat. After two days, the glitter is pealing up from under the top coat (I will post pics). Also, my other nails are chipping after only 4 days. You can also see that my cuticles were not well groomed. \n\nOther salons where I've received gel manicures, my polish lasts 10 days easily, 2+weeks at great salons, like The Nail Club in Longhorne.",

Our server was incredibly attentive, constantly checking on our large group (ended up tipping more than the already included gratuity). For appetizers, the prosciutto wrapped artichokes were the best I've ever had, and my girlfriend's tomato and mozzarella caprese was exceptional. \n\nFor our main entree the salmon over spinach and potatoes was fantastic- fish was cooked perfectly and the accented vegetables went well with the salmon. The gnocchi was always class! Portions were huge- our friend's veal parm was enormous and also delicious!\n\nThe cannoli was just ok, but the sundae on the restaurant week menu was delicious. Paired with good coffee and complimentary limoncello (a bit too strong but it was complimentary) it was a great way to end the meal. \n\nWould definitely recommend! They even comp your parking!",

Noticing that it was early we decided it wasn't quite 5 o clock somewhere for us and so we stopped in here for some coffee! \n\nI actually didn't want anything because in general coffee is too heavy for my sensitive stomach. My mom was not to be challenged though. Haha she brought me a latte and at first I was like aww that's sweet but ugh. Then I sipped. And I kept sipping! The temperature was perfect. Hot but drinkable! (I hate when I get a drink and I have to wait 15 minutes to drink it.) The flavor was wonderful and the atmosphere was really cute too. \n\nThe reason this place gets 4 stars is because there isn't wifi, and they didn't have any kind of other pastries.

The sausage was the clear standout, but the ribs were good, too. For sides, he had the potato salad and black eyed peas. The potato salad was great, but he would try something other than the peas next time. I had the one meat platter with pulled pork - it had a nice smoky flavor - worth ordering again. For sides, I had the maque choux mac and cheese - unique with great kick, and the coleslaw - a good option. We redeemed the Yelp check-in special and thoroughly enjoyed the free cheese fries - very cheesy with good texture. On top of the great food, the owner was super friendly and helpful, the sauce variety was awesome, and the prices were fair. We look forward to visiting again, and encourage you to try this place!",

She is clearly a perfectionist and lover of food, refining and tweaking certain ingredients on our menu until it was perfect - something I would order in a restaurant for dinner any day. All the food I have sampled so far has been truly special, handmade and inspired; the local ingredients are just icing on the cake. (seriously, whatever bacon they are sourcing is magical)\n\nThroughout the process, Birchtree has always been prompt in email responses, organized, easy to contact, flexible, and exceedingly professional. I have always felt I was a focus and priority for them, even in the thick of wedding season when they are juggling multiple clients. This is refreshing considering some 'known' caterers never even bothered to return my initial calls when inquiring about a quote. Working with these women over the last year has truly been a joy and I cannot wait to taste the final product in a few weeks at our ceremony!",

It was delicious if not a little weird-looking...Due to allergies, one in our party got a split pea and ham soup and the other a tomato red pepper bisque. Kudos to them for having substitutions (the waiter explained it's their vegetarian option as the mushroom one is no longer vegetarian), and both enjoyed their soups, but I personally didn't really like either of them.\n\n--Appetizer (8 options): We had the Calamars, the Tarte de Legumes, the Tartare, and the Salade Boston. I had the \"sustainably-harvested calamari stuffed with house-made provençal sausage, fresh herbs, saffron rice, piperade, jus de legumes\"...I don't know why but I was expecting your more usual fried calimari, and I'm not a huge fan of fresh seafood, so I didn't particularly care for it. The other two who had it absolutely loved it though. I also tried the \"Tarte de Legumes: roasted eggplant caviar, caramelized onion, and red pepper tart with black olive and goat cheese tapenade, herb sauce, poached Sandy Ridge Farm egg\" and WOW was it delicious. The runny yolk, the tapenade was delicious, and the tart was a little mini cookie-but-not-a-cookie kind of phylo dough thing, a nice accompaniment, as was the bit of greens it was served with. The \"Tartare: fresh Scottish salmon, mango, basil, capers, black olives, cornichons, tomato, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and wonton crisps\" was apparently good, but was being eaten by a tartare conoisseur (6/10 on her scale). She said \"It had bigger chunks of salmon than a standard tartare, which makes it a little fishier tasting.\" The salad (\"Boston bibb lettuce with crumbled gorgonzola cheese, apple, walnut pralines, and walnut vinaigrette\") was well received: a sweet little salad. My only note on the salad is that it's not a real leafy salad. A couple large leafs of lettuce topped with the other stuff. Fancy salad.\n\n--Main course (8 options): We had the lamb (Agneau), steak (Bavette), scallops (Vol au Vent), and salmon (Saumon). The lamb was oh so tender, literally fall-off-the-bone. Even after removing all the fat/skin, there was plenty of meat for a good-sized entree. The mashed potatoes were also awesome. Carrots were fine, but I didn't notice any turnips. My friend had the steak and loved it, although we noted it was rather lukewarm if not on the cold side. She liked her mashed sweet potatoes and the green beans too. I personally, having tried all the dishes, would say this one was the least special, although still good. I think my favorite was the salmon (\"Saumon: pistachio and goat cheese-crusted Scottish salmon filet wrapped in phyllo, carrot purée, creamy Swiss chard, light turmeric and cumin sauce\"), although I can't say I tasted the goat cheese. It was just delicious salmon in delicious buttery phyllo. And finally, the scallops (\"Vol au Vent: butter-poached scallops in puff pastry with creamy Swiss chard and saffron mussel sauce\") were delicious as well. The sauce they pour over it (table-side) is a sauce made with cream and the juice that the scallops and mussels cook in. It was heavenly. The scallops aren't literally in the puff pastry. It's a puff pastry in the middle (my friend wished the pastry hadn't been soaked as it got soggy, so maybe ask your waiter to pour around it), with 4 good-sized scallops around it and lots of different little vegetables (I want to say I stole some okra off her plate but I could be completely wrong) that get drowned in the delicious sauce. Yum.\n\n--Dessert (4 options): We tried all except the profiteroles: the St. Tropez Cake (\"double-layer valhrona chocolate mousse cake with crème anglaise\"), the Tart Tatin (\"warmed French caramelized apple tart a la mode\"), and the Creme Brulee (\"caramelized vanilla bean flan\"). The cake was our least favorite by far. The bottom is like a spongy cake, and is not texturally-appealing, although the mousse part on top is good. Would not order it again. The Tart Tatin was delicious, although they were out of ice cream, so we got fresh whipped cream instead. I also wish it had been served a little warmer than it was (it was room temp), but it was just a simple little apple tart. Not too sweet, just simple. And the creme brulee was well executed.\n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was awesome. Funny and friendly and knew the menu very well. Asked us if we needed anything at a couple points throughout the meal. Water was always filled. My only complaint is the lady who seated us was cloyingly polite, it was annoying.\n\n---------\n\nGreat little place!",

Bob, the guy on AM drive-thru, always has a kind word for me, and made the effort to know me by name. The drinks are almost always good, though I have had mistakes before. The staff here isn't as diligent after the busy morning hours, but no major complaints. A good tip for any Starbucks patron visiting even once a week is to sign up for their Rewards program. By paying with a pre-paid gift card that is registered on their site, members are treated to special offers, periodic freebies and more. It's really worth it if you frequent often.",

They obviously spent a lot of money figuring out how to decorate this place to make people want to stay for long periods of time and spend money.  The blackjack tables have a sidebet called 'straight jack' which is fun to play (though I wouldn't recommend putting more than one dollar on the side bet for every five on the main bet, it isn't cost efficient).  The poker room is spacious and clean and has interesting promotions running most of the time.  Almost every employee that I've met there has been friendly and helpful.\n\nIf you're determined to lose your money, lose it here!  At least you'll have a good time!",

The beer was great and the food was excellent.  It also has a very nice look on the inside.  It's a bit dressy, but you can get away with dressing casual.\n\nIt is a bit pricey, however.  It's certainly too much to be a regular place for my wife and I.  However, I have been a few times and I've enjoyed everything I've tried on the menu--from pasta to steak.  They have a quality menu.\n\nThe beer is better than I expected.  I'm a bit of a sucker for browns and they have some excellent selections in this category.  They have an rich taste and are very well crafted.  The beer here is top notch, especially for a micro-brew.\n\nFor me, Granite City is a nice spot.  It isn't a place where I would just stop in after having the \"Where do you want to go for dinner?\" conversation.  You can certainly get away with going casual, but it is a bit nicer than the average restaurant.  I am interested to see how their beer selection evolves.  I think they're off to a great start!",

My only minor gripe was the way the lettuce, sour cream, etc came out all on one plate. It made putting the fajita together a little tougher if there was something on there you didn't want.\n\nBut the real gem, crazy as it seems, are the firecrackers. See, I love poppers. They're spicy, fried and filled with cheese which basically makes them meet three of my four major food groups (the other being chocolate, of course). But the firecrackers aren't the wimpy frozen things you get at any pizza place in town. Oh no, these are huge singe-your-mouth peppers filled with a wonderfully melty gooey blend of cheeses and fried to crisp perfection. They're messy, certainly unhealthy and burn even my mouth a bit, but they are by far the best cheese-filled pepper concoction I've found.\n\nFirecrackers = worth a whole new star.\n\n(Was tempted to write about the firecrackers without giving an extra star, though, just to reflect the irritation I feel with their frequent and lousy guest bartenders. I don't care how cute she is, if she can't pour my drink and take my money get her the hell out from behind the bar!)",

  "text": "I'm calling this place the \"La Colombe\" of hummus. Like LC, this place takes you on a culinary tour of Lebanon and Turkey. The flavors are beyond fresh and unique. They're totally in a league of their own! \n\nThe menu is slightly overwhelming, so I defaulted to the original hummus and green salad. The original hummus is soft and nutty just like Zahav/Dizengoff (sorry to pull so many restaurants into this, but I think alluding to them shows the high standard of quality Suraya meets). I blame that on the tehina, Soom Foods. It is served with a pita, fresh from the oven, and it's soft and airy with a subtle crust. The green salad included gem lettuce, raw fennel, watermelon radishes, a soft-boiled egg, yogurt dressing, and pita chips. The flavor profile was satisfying. The meal overall was light, filling, and nourishing! \n\nI went back for seconds the week after. Opted for the baba ganoush, pita, and the rest of the party got the gravlax. Overall, everyone was satisfied. While the ganoush was tasty, I think I'll stick to the hummus. I appreciate that particular spread much more.  \n\nAgain, service and atmosphere were 10/10!",

Guilin is convenient (relatively close to campus), and the food satisfies my cravings for Chinese food.  I also really like their myriad of vegetarian/pescatarian options.   It's really nice to be able to order favourite dishes without meat or having to pay extra because seafood/shrimp is the only other option.  The service here is fast and friendly.  Food is set on the table within about 10 minutes of ordering.",

So I went in expecting a solid sandwich but noting exceptional.  For the most part I go into eating establishments just wondering how the food will be.  I rarely worry about the hospitality.  I have to highlight this place not only for their food but for their customer service.  The owner himself took my order and we chatted it up for a bit.  Very friendly and very easy to talk to.  I landed on the Benton Park Po' Boy.  Other than the deliciously fresh ingredients the sweet red pepper sauce is to die for! Food came out very quickly and was uber yummy!  Tucked away on what seemed to be a quite residential block is this hidden gem.  Go for it!",

  "text": "Sabino Canyon is tops in my book.  Tops for everything- running, hiking, tours, nature talks, etc.\n\nA one-use day pass is $5 and an annual pass is $20 (so it pretty much pays for itself if you come here often enough).  The parking lot can get crowded on weekends, but stick it out!\n\nI love that on Saturdays, bikes aren't allowed at all (sorry cycling buds!) and on Sundays, no bikes are allowed past 9:30 am.  There are a LOT of pedestrians on the tram road during those hours and to be honest, the cyclists hardly ever let you know they're passing and it can make for a dangerous situation. \n\nThe tram road is a 7.4 out and back paved path, and absolutely beautiful.  I love running it in the early morning with the sun peeking over the mountains.  The scenery is stunning and you will be hard-pressed to find another wonderful attraction like this.\n\nThe trams start up around 9:30 and are diesel-powered 2-car trams,  one with a shade over it and one open.  These are a great way to see the canyon without hiking/running the whole thing.  Another idea is to take the tram in and then hike out or vice versa.  \n\nSabino Canyon is a Tucson staple. If you've never visited the desert before, this is definitely a great all-inclusive stop.  The visitor center has awesome activities and educational stuff for all ages.\n\nImportant tips:\n- Wear a hat!\n- Bring lots of water.  7 miles in shaded woods is different than 7 miles here!",

  "text": "It can be intimidating when first arriving but don't let that stop you. Coat check and initial entrance are on the first floor. You walk down a corridor to the elevator and ride all the way to the top floor of the building. It's low lighting so pictures might be hard but it's a super trendy and hip atmosphere. More on the lounge side. Lighting is probably to make it seem more intimate. \n\nThe view! Omg, the view of Philadelphia is amazing and totally worth it! \n\nThe food is absolutely fantastic. Very pricey but totally worth it. \n\nI had the spare ribs with roasted carrots and potatoes. My husband had the tuna with a poached egg and a delicious clam sauce. We shared fries dipped first in the mayo sauce and then dipped in house steak sauce. Delicious! We cleaned our entire plates! I'd like to note that the ribs are first braised which makes them tender and slow cooked and then they are grilled. Grilling helps hold the meat together. From a culinary aspect, the texture is easier to cut and hold together on a fork which makes eating much easier. Just braised would be delicious but fall apart which means you'd need a spoon rather than a fork to pick it up. \n\nDessert we ordered the toasted cinnamon crunch. My husband had to have it because of the Krispy Kreme donuts used to make the ice cream. It was accompanied by some crunchy cinnamon brioche bits, toasted hazelnuts, and some sort of cinnamon whipped dollops.  Overall, delicious. Very sweet. \n\nI was disappointed there wasn't a single chocolate dessert option other than a chocolate sorbet. \n\nWe loved every minute, ate every bite! Soooooo delicious. For all that  our bill was just under $90. Again, pricey but worth it since this was our special dinner while visiting Philly. \n\nAttire: men were in suits and jackets. The ladies were in pants, dresses, and heels. You can totally wear jeans as I did but I would recommend classing it up with heels or dress shoes.",

This store wouldn't be quite so bad if the employees were more polite and weren't always complaining about their co-workers. I was in this store 3 weeks ago which was my first time back there since last Christmas. Nothing had changed in the grumpiness of the employees as they were discussing how lazy other employees were. I dropped off a box of children's clothing and before I left they told me that they were backed up and wouldn't get to my stuff for about a week and a half!!! It ended up taking just over a week and a half and they barely gave me a few dollars. Not worth the long wait when I could have gone to Kidz Again or Kid to Kid where they go through my stuff the same day I bring it all in. Even during the busy back to school weeks the longest Kidz Again has ever taken to go through my items is one day.",

The tree growing \"through\" the wall was pretty awesome.  The place is pretty small - basically a bar with some tables in front, back, and along the sides. \n\nService was solid, the waitress recommended some good drinks off of their extensive cocktail menu.  I'm not a cocktail pro, but I thought they were delicious and well made.  Our waitress actually recommended many of the \"classic\" cocktails over the ones on the menu.  My advice would be to discuss what you like with the bartenders/servers and let them make appropriate recommendations.  \n\nThe food was good, we had a full dinner here, but I think most people are heading to Libertine for the drinks and atmosphere.  I haven't been to the Ball & Biscuit yet, so I can't compare it to that, but I thought it held its own with many of the well-known Chicago cocktail bars (Whistler, Violet Hour).

That being said they've got some work to do and don't seem to be doing it including adding more beers (just three bud products? come on!!) also they don't seem to open the old art bar  side which was always nice for casual seating.  Like most clubs today it's built to make money off of VIP sections But they really don't provide any security to keep anybody from wandering into your section or grabbing your $200 bottle of vodka.  And another major complaint is only having one bathroom for boys and one for girls.  it's not worth getting VIP tickets because you can just go into a little area that has a miniature bar that's stripped  down with less alcohol.  They do have respectable sound but very  little in the way of lasers and cool lights.  I hope Christian and his staff keep improving and I do have to tip my cap for the talent to DJs they brought in.  It's a tough business to make money but I hope they can make it through and get back to the way Dantes was in its glory days.  Time will tell ...",

Everything was OK, but it was just OK, and I guess I had higher expectations from the offspring of such infamous ancestry.  We started off with the blistered Shishito peppers with sesame ponzu on the side which are an appetizer; but alone there just really isn't much to it.  The peppers actually gave a little flavor to our burgers. Although the burger styles are creative, they just didn't seem to have much flavor.  We had the lamb and the homecoming burger.  Both were ordered medium well and came out what seemed to me more medium rare.  We didn't send it back, which is on us because we were short on time, but I feel it should have been prepared to our order.  The homecoming had the root beer glazed bacon, but it was just two very small half strips that were too small to lend any flavor.  All of us liked the cucumber tomato salad. We truly enjoyed the Bourbon milkshake with the Eagle Reserve poured table side.  Our server was fantastic.  Considering the plethora of burger options in the city and the menu is in St. Elmo fashion, al a carte and pricey, I just think the final impression and the quality fall short for the price tag.",

Since we were short on cash we were looking for options and Empress garden came into mind.\nWe were seated immediately as soon as we walked in. They gave us water and came back to take our order. My friend got the pork belly and tofu on rice which also came with boy choy. I go the string beans with minced pork, extra spicy. Everything was hot and fresh. The pork belly was perfectly melt-in-your-mouth good and the string beans were crispy just the way I like them. The service was on point and everyone was kind to us.\n\nThanks again for another great experience!",

  "text": "New favorite brewery on Nashville. Was welcomed immediately by one of the owners who served me and talked to me about beer for 15 minutes. Everything I had was a very solid beer, ranging from a rosemary fall beer to a super crushable ESB. The bar itself is very nice and clean. It opens on to the brewery itself which is nice to poke your head in to. 5 regular beers on tap, a seasonal, 3 barrel aged beers, and 2 session ales rounded out the offering while I was here. Do yourself a HUGE favor and come here and get the flight to taste a range of great local beer.",

Three cakes usually come to an order, and when I told our server that I was having a hard time choosing from the cherry supreme, cornmeal cakes or Santa Fe cornmeal cakes, she said I could get one of each. I liked all of them, but the Santa Fe cakes were my favorite. Amazing! I think three cherry supreme would give me a serious tummy ache, but one was perfect. My husband had the Eggs and Cakes (the buttermilk pancakes) with sugar ham, and he really liked it all. There was a line to get in, but it went fairly quickly, and the staff was super attentive. They even had coffee while you wait. Nice experience!",

Occasionally, the scoops of rice or beans are slightly larger than other times, which means I just have more for later since I can't finish a who bowl in one sitting!\n\nMy usual order is white rice, black beans, barbacoa (love it!), mild and medium sauce, corn, cheese, sour cream, and lettuce. Mmmm... I'm craving it now.\n\nThis is good stuff for fast food. The food seems to turn over quickly, so I don't know what the issues are with cleanliness that others are complaining about. The place is popular, so at certain times it gets REALLY busy, which means service seems slow, and sometimes you have to wait for fresh replacement food to come out. When it's not busy, it's been fast service.",

What really pissed me off that we called downstairs for more towels and blankets. The front desk kept saying they will be up. After about fives hours my husband had to remind me that they still did not send the items we requested. I called down to the front desk again, they apologized then replied we are all out. You can't be serious, I have eight children wet from the pool with no towels to dry off. We made it work but that really pissed me off. Another thing the pool is on the rooftop outside. I kind of wish they had an inside pool because it started to rain, while the kids was swimming and it was a little cooler than we liked. Will I return I seriously doubt it.",

She carries GREAT and affordable accessories and I love the sunglasses she carries, so much so that I currently am rotating 3 pairs. \n\nLove that she supports other small business owners via trunks shows for various local jewelry, hat, purse makers.

  "text": "If you get the Crispy Mac n' Cheese, you've already set yourself up for a good experience. \n\nThe waiter talked us into ordering the small-portioned albeit delectable appetizer after ordering both the Margherita and White pizzas -- and let's face it, he didn't have to try that hard. The Mac n' Cheese was brought to our table alongside our additional house salads which, too, were surprisingly crisp and refreshing. However, they were only a side note to the bursting flavor of the Crispy Mac n' Cheese. \n\nI consider myself a 'texture' person when it comes to food so I was quite satisfied with the crispness of the outer shell especially when most restaurants with a similar menu item tend to lean toward the soggy side. But that's not all - the mac n' cheese inside the shell was some of the creamiest, richest, and moistest (yes - I hate this word) mac n' cheese I've ever had. The only downside is the portion size which turns out to be only 4 bite-size nuggets. If you're hungry, order two servings (we didn't have any hangups since we ordered two pizzas for our table). It would be nice if CPK increased the portion size to at least 5 bites, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.\n\nNow on to the pizza. Again, we ordered the White and the Margherita pizzas and both were good. As far as I'm concerned, I've had better 'white' pizzas from Domino's and Hot Box (The Big Cheese is the same thing in my book), but CPK's was good enough. I probably wouldn't order it again due to the outstanding menu choices which I also deem to be one of this restaurant's strengths, but my focus remained on the Mac n' Cheese (did I already mention that I liked the Mac n' Cheese?) AND the Margherita pizza. In the realm of Margherita pizzas, this was hands down one of the best I've ever had. It's thin-crusted, light and airy with the perfect blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses that penetrate all the way down to the crust. I liken this pizza to a can of Pringles; once I popped (a slice into my mouth), I just couldn't stop (popping more and more slices). I highly recommend this pizza and if you are adamant about smothering your pizza in cheese, you might want to order extra or something else altogether.\n\nI'll finish with the atmosphere. As most people are already aware, this used to be Alcatraz - a fancy(ish) Brewhouse located inside/outside of the Circle Centre Mall. In my opinion, it doesn't quite fit into my normal expectation for a 'pizza place.' I felt that it was obvious that it used to be occupied by another restaurant and it definitely didn't have that welcome-to-our-extended-family vibe that most sit-in pizza places have. I sort of felt out of place when ordering JUST pizza as if I should've ordered shrimp cocktail for an appetizer, but once again I'm only nitpicking. Our waiter was superb and I never had to wait for a refill. The bathroom was quite dirty during my visit. I don't know if this had to do with the fact that it was the day after the Super Bowl, but the place was pretty dead so I'm going to chalk this one up to laziness. \n\nOverall, if I'm in the area and have a taste for pizza, I'll probably go back... that's if I'm not drinking and closer to Hot Box down the street.",

Our meal was excellent, without exception. \n\nIt's a small place, and they were almost completely full when we got there. We were seated right away, at a cute little 2-top by the door. I liked the cozy feel of the place. We were having trouble deciding what to order, and struck up a conversation with the couple next to us about what they'd ordered, which helped us make up our minds. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the bluefish appetizer and I got the winter vegetable salad. I could eat that salad every day and never get tired of it. We also split the poached egg wrapped in pancetta. It was served with sauteed spinach and mushrooms, and If you eat here, and it's on the menu, this is a must!  For dinner, boyfriend got the flatiron steak and I ordered the spot pig with spaetzle. Again, both were incredible.  We were so full, we didn't have a chance to try the dessert.  \n\nThe whole experience, from the food to the service, to the clientele (we also ended up talking to the couple seated next to us after the first couple left) made for a perfect birthday dinner for my boyfriend.  I will definitely go back.",

The inside is very unassuming, pretty humble and low key with some nice art on the walls. \n\nThe salsa here is decent and the food solid. I did really like the carne asada, it was actual steak. Too many Mexican places around town use tasteless, odorless brown beef nuggets. We also ordered a pitcher of margaritas that was pretty run of the mill flavor wise but kinda lacking in the tequila department, tons of mixer in this one. The enchiladas, beans, and rice were all solid Mexican faire but nothing I'd go out of my way for. My favorite item here was definitely the carne asada. \n\nService started out strong but ended up being the downfall of our entire visit. Upon arriving we were seated pretty quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. Service was quick all the way through ordering and getting our food, at which point flagging down our server was nearly impossible. It took us 15 minutes after asking for the check to actually get it. \n\nOnce we gave a card to process payment, we ended up waiting another 15+ minutes at which point I got up to check on progress to see the cashier boy texting away on his phone with our card sitting at the counter. When I got his attention he mentioned he needed an ID to be able to run the card. I asked how we would ever have found that out, to which his response was \"idk I guess we're busy\". They were less than half as busy as when we arrived and service was stellar. For future reference, if you could just acknowledge that the mistake was on your end and not make some lame excuse deflecting responsibility for it, I think I would've walked away feeling a little better about this place. All I've gathered from this is that the staff don't care, which doesn't give me much confidence in this place. \n\nThe food here is solid, acceptable Mexican food. Portion sizes are large enough to satisfy any appetite but in a city full of amazing Mexican food Michas is just not worth the effort. I'll stick to getting my fix of this place when it's catered to my office.",

My issue is the portion size for the price point. \n\n1 - My first time I ordered the scallops and for $18 you get 4 scallops and about two or three tablespoons of lentils. Nothing else on the plate. I was definitely still very hungry so I sampled what was leftover from appetizers, my friends general tso wings, which were okay. Tasty, but nothing special. The accompaniments to the wings were just blah. I ended up leaving this night very hungry. \n\n2 - I decided there were enough positives to give it one more try. My second visit I ordered the sweet potato gnocci $16 and my friend ordered the duck sandwich. I wish I would have counted, however there may have been 8-12 gnocci on my plate max. It looked like less of a portion than an appetizer. I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I've ordered gnocci and not needed a to-go box. I knew immediately I was still going to be hungry. The flavor, however, was very good.\n\nMy friend was equally unsatisfied with his duck sandwich. It was about  half a sandwich size and did not come with anything on the side. For dinner you would expect a sandwich to have something, anything on the side. I felt bad for him and offered some of my gnocci, which we joked about. We both left still hungry and after paying we decided that we had to hit another spot on the way home in order to get some satisfying food. I know this sounds silly, but we are fit people used to dining in all types of establishments, most often downtown and due to the portion sizes and price point at the Blue Duck we will not be back for a third time. \n\nIf I hear they've made improvements in those two areas I would consider returning because they are on to something with their flavor pairings.",

  "text": "Three stars seems a little harsh, but I don't go in for rating inflation.\n\nI went last night and had a good experience.  Our waitress was fantastic.  I also liked the rhubarb martini and would recommend it.  I'm not the biggest fan of small plates - especially with this style of New American cooking.  It seems weird to me to get meatloaf and potatoes in a \"sort-of\" entree portion.  When I start shelling out $40-$50 bucks on dinner I like to have the arc of starter-entree-dessert.  Maybe I'm old fashioned.\n\nA few specific dishes:\n- Nachos (which came out last, not ideal): I love any kind of nacho but these weren't my favorite, especially as only about every other sweet potato chip was crispy.\n- Breakfast: Love the sausage and the egg was well cooked. The pork belly was good in the way that all fatty things are, but not a revelation. This is cute food.\n- Bacon wrapped meatloaf: The potatoes that come with it are really good and the meatloaf is tasty. \n- Macerated berries dessert with lemon pudding and basil gelato: The berries marinated in Gran Marnier were excellent, but the gelato was bland.\n- Pecan financier: The cake itself was less than elegant.  It was mealy and the graham cracker that came with it was definitely a throw away.\n\nAll that said, I really like and want to support this place.  I will definitely go back for lunch for one of the Blue Plate Specials.  The concept of revising the menu each day is admirable, but the unfortunate consequence is that the dishes aren't really refined.\n\nGo try it.  I agree with Jodi who said this spot \"has its heart in the right place.\"",

Next, you actually get to the most exciting part of all (which still isn't very exciting): the hallway with all of the steps to making coins. This hallway also has views of the machines.

When we first sat down the air condition was at full blast and our table was like a wind tunnel. Danielle got that taken care of for us without even having to ask. We were there Friday afternoon during Happy Hour and all of their Don Q rum drinks are buy one get one. So I had a delicious rum cranberry and orange juice concoction. \n\nOn to the food, my friend is Mexican and is always raving about her husband's ceviche so we decided to start with the ceviche which was half off as well for happy hour. It was amazing. I had never had ceviche before and I'm glad Salsa\"s was my first. It was served in a plantain cup and it was the perfect mix of sweet and sour. If this was an indicator of what was to come with the entrees, I was excited. \n\nWe decided to split two dishes. The carne frita and the chicken breast stuffed with plantains. Each entree comes with a side. We got the mixed rice and the  fried yuca mash. Everything came out quickly and was very hot and fresh tasting. The star of everything for me was the mixed rice. I got have eaten a vat of that rice. The chicken was served with a delicious cream sauce. The plantains and the chicken married together so well. The carne frita was served with sautéed onions and a nice flavorful brown sauce. I did not have a complaint about anything we ate, it was all delicious. The man at the table next to us ordered this humongous pork hop that we can't wait to go back and try. Our buser told us it was over 2 lbs! My goodness. \n\nI was really impressed by the knowledge of all of the staff regarding the food and the ingredients. Cannot wait to go back to Salsa. Great new find and something a little different from the standard fare.",

Quite honestly I felt like I was a burden coming into eat. Our waitress had the same sort of vibe... You could obviously tell she wasn't excited to be at her job and that my boyfriend and I were just CUSTOMERS to her and not GUESTS.\n\n As for the food I kind of lost my appetite while eating. I just didn't feel at ease about the cleanliness of the whole restaurant and the food was just questionable especially the orange chicken that was an odd type of squishy. To give them some credit their ice cream was pretty dang good but not worth the $20.00 spent for 2 people to eat lunch. MY ADVICE WOULD BE: IF YOU HAVE A CRAVING FOR CHINESE FOOD, JUST STICK WITH PANDA EXPRESS...",

They don't skimp on the meat or the cheese. Done the right way on Amoroso bread. They use crisp lettuce on their clubs so it tastes fresh. Unlike the limp, soggy lettuce you get from other places. The waffles and pancakes are cooked to the perfect fluffiness. Crisp bacon and eggs are a staple.\n\nAdd quick and friendly service to sweeten the deal. As others have said, great for lunch during the week but it does get busy so go a little bit early if possible. But if you have to wait, it's worth it. Can't do lunch?

Since we were only drinking, not eating, we made sure to tell the hostess that, because their bar area was full. She sat us at a dining table anyway, even after we asked if she was sure it was okay. We didn't want to inconvenience them, but it was 3pm and there was no evident mealtime rush. She assured us it was fine.\n\nClearly, NOT fine. It takes a lot to make me feel guilty for drinking (sorry for partying), but I immediately felt the disapproval from our server. When we had to tell him that we were just drinking (couldn't the hostess have told him that?), there was some major attitude. When he brought us our first round of drinks, he asked if this would be the only round. It just seemed rush, weird, and full of 'tude. I imagine they aren't hurting for business since they have a prime location for hungry tourists that don't feel like looking any further, but that's also probably the same reason they can get away with being a little rude. \n\nIf it wasn't for the supreme politeness and friendliness from other New Orleans restaurants, then maybe my standards wouldn't be so high, but Mr. B's fell short of the outstanding customer service we experienced at virtually every other establishment, yes, even the to-go daiquiri shops.",

  "text": "Fort Edmonton Park is easily my favorite place to visit in Edmonton. I go at least once a year, and never get tired of it.  I like historical recreation parks and visit them when travelling whenever I can, but Fort Edmonton is still at the top of my list.  The costumed interpreters are all very friendly and easy to talk to, but I've never felt pressured to engage with them like I have at some other parks.  You can immerse yourself as much or as little as you like.  \n\nAlong with providing the opportunity to learn a lot of interesting history about Edmonton, the park is just a nice place to walk around in the summer.   It's very peaceful on weekdays, and there are numerous areas to enjoy a picnic lunch undisturbed.  I highly recommend their Christmas Reflections event in December.  You have to pre-buy your tickets at a certain departure time, and with the ticket you gain entry into the park, a ride on a horse drawn carriage, and various Christmas themed activities.  The park is magical in the winter at night with all the lights on the trees and buildings, and the carriage ride takes you around the end of the park where there aren't any electric lights.  The Christmas craft activities are aimed at kids, but both times I have gone with a group of adults we have spent hours sitting and crafting.  There is also the opportunity to enjoy a Christmas play and sing Christmas carols along with a string quartet.  \n\nThe 1920's midway is the newest addition to the park, and well worth the money for some ride and game tickets.  The carousel is beautiful - wooden and hand-painted, and the midway games are all old fashioned and more fun than most of the games at a modern midway.  \n\nI can't sing the praises of the Park and it's staff enough.  They have been investing more in recent years in advertising and promotions, and I hope more Edmontonians enjoy this local gem in the river valley.",

My husband had a cubano sandwich that he loved. Our other friend ordered a salad which he said was very good. He ordered his dressing on the side. He asked for a little more dressing as it only came with one small cup. The waitress immediately brought another cup over. At the end of the evening we noticed we were charged .69 cents for the additional dressing. This was surprising and disappointing. Overall it was a favorable experience but the restaurant has a few kinks to iron out and should not charge for a little extra dressing for a salad.",

My kids love the red beans and rice, hush puppies, and of course beignets. A small  order is enough for a 10 year old and it is $3.95 (I think) so you can't beat that.... I would recommend if you get a shrimp po' boy, make sure you order extra shrimp. The small price increase will be worth it. Also get the sauce on the side as often the staff use way too much.  The place is not fancy or pretentious in any way.  And yes, some staff members are more personable than others.  We like chatting with the owner (We think he is the owner but regardless a very nice man!).  My kids also love just going to listen to the music and we often end up staying for them to play cards (cards are by the items for sale).   Do I wish they had some grilled items and something green, yes...   But I accept that they do not....  Not sure about all the 1's.....  I have been to New Orleans and no it does not compare...  But I would prefer to appreciate it for the positives....

The place is huge! \n\nFood - 2 stars unfortunately.   Three of the three plates arrived with cold food.   The chicken in two of the plates seemed to be reheated frozen chicken.   The chicken strips were very uniform in cut and color to be fresh it seemed..... and were cold.   It surprises me that QDoba, Baja Fresh,  and Chipotle can serve fresh hot chicken as fast food restaurants but Crooked struggled.   I do realize the kitchen is still young and working out the kinks,  but delivering cold bland chicken should be fixed within the first few days of opening. \nThe French Fries get 4 stars.   They are very tasty and crispy.   They arrived warm.\nI recommend The Barrelhouse for a great place for beer but have not been sold on the food part. We well definitely be back with hopes of improvements from the kitchen.",

  "text": "Decided to try Indian food for the first time and WOW. This place is amazing!!! Their food tastes so fresh and cooked to perfection. I always get the garlic naan and the shrimp biryani. I also got the Madras latte and I loved it. Ever since, I've been driving out of my way just to drive to Mt. Juliet whenever I get my Indian food cravings. I have tried other Indian food from this place and they do not compare. The only negative comment I have is that their customer service is not the best and is inconsistent at times. Overall I recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Indian food.",

  "text": "The Cunningham Restaurant Group has taken the Indy food scene by storm, and they never fail to please. Due to the diversity of offerings, comparing one of their restaurants to another is a welcomed impossibility.  Livery, the newest addition to the company's line of exquisite eateries, is certainly their most unique.  \n\nHoused in the old Indianapolis Police Department Horse Livery, the Cunningham Restaurant Group puts a modern and hip twist on a historic building.  Livery is a gorgeous restaurant.  While certainly an establishment of class, it fails at being pretentious.  The atmosphere is relaxed, and with its two-levels of dining space and beautiful patio, the diner will never be uncomfortable.  Even if one is forced to wait for a table, which, with the Livery's popularity, is certainly a possibility, pausing at one of the restaurant's two bars is sure to bolster the appetite.\n\nThe toughest decision one will make at Livery is what to order.  The Latin American-inspired menu caters to solo and group diners alike.  With many small plate options, no one is forced - or even tempted to choose just one item.  That wouldn't be any fun.  I suggest going big, going all-out, and having a damn good time doing it.  I started with the yuca fries, the chorizo empanada, street corn, ribs & jicama, and ceviche.  Clearly, I did not eat all of this by myself - but I was tempted.  The yuca fries, coupled with Chihuahua cheese, were absolutely delectable.  Don't dine at Livery without getting an order.  The chorizo empanada, hearty and piping hot, nearly made me lose my inhibitions (i.e. not share them). The ribs and jicama were quite tender - and how 'bout that barbecue sauce? Mmm..mmm..mmm.  They were so good that once the plate was passed to me, I only got to eat one-half of a rib; it's all Livery's fault.\n\nMy second course included the the chile relleno and the pork pastor.  The chile relleno, like everything else, was terrific.  The Chihuahua cheese, as with the yuca fries, really tied the dish together.  The couscous innards put a special North African twist on a popular Mexican dish. The pork pastor was truly magnificent. The piquant blend of flavors from the pork, pineapple, onion, and cabbage makes this the most interesting item on the menu. Next time, I'm getting an order all to myself.\n\nI always save the best for last: dessert.  There is absolutely no reason to ever skip it, especially when dining at Livery.  The churros.  The churros.  The churros...fried, sweet, and as delicious as \"delicious\" can get.  I am guilty of licking the plate clean.  Since the kitchen and bar stay open late, Livery is a wonderful spot for dessert and after-dinner drinks.\n\nAs with any other restaurant in the Cunningham Restaurant Group's portfolio, the service at Livery is superior.  Our particular server was personable, well-versed on the menu, and speedy.  Given how busy he was with other guests, I felt his efforts were worthy of note.\n\nLivery is a five-star experience.  It is a restaurant that does not have to put on airs to impress its guests, and I highly recommend it.",

I had a wonderful home birth, but was in need of a breast pump to help get the contractions going Sunday evening. It was almost impossible to find a breast pump at that time.  Despite the owner being on the verge of giving birth herself, and despite it being late Sunday evening, she responded to our voicemail quickly and helped get us the pump we needed! It was crucial to allowing my birth to go as smoothly as it did! Since then, I have taken a Mama's Connect group, a baby CPR class, Mama-Baby Yoga and will be signing up for the Baby Sign Language workshop. I have made so many friends and connected with so many other Mamas in the area.  I have only lived i the bay area for about two years, and have absolutely no family nearby. The community I have made through Then Comes Baby is so important to me.  It is a beautiful, warm, and welcoming space, conveniently located and I would recommend it to all families.",

  "text": "Update: Black Palm unfortunately went out of business in early September.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlack Palm is an elegant, comfortable restaurant that serves excellent food. Wife and I have been to this spot three times now, and each time have found the food to be inventive and delicious.\n\nAtmosphere - the owners have redone the interior in aquas and dark woods, with a rich, elegant feel. It compliments the original arabesque interior really well. The restaurant is nicely lit for a date, and the tables are decently spaced. We've seen a few kids here, but it is really geared for a more adult experience. \n\nFood - many dishes are Spanish inspired (such as paella etc) but the requisite steaks, scallops etc are also on the menu. Everything we've had has been tasty. Salads are not skimpy, and the apps, which can be hit or miss at many places have for us been unique and showed a lot of thought. The arapas royale in particular are freaking delicious. Last night wife loved the corvina, and in the past the chicken in banana leaves have been great.\n\nBonus - the restaurant is basically situated in a little park on the bay, and strolling out on the lovely dock after dinner was a perfect way to extend our evening. \n\nIn short, this is one of our favorites in the area. In a sea of mediocrity, this restaurant is an inventive standout with a great atmosphere in a lovely setting.",

Panicked with knowing my salon in Michigan couldn't get me in before the big day, I called Plume knowing that a last minute Friday appointment was going to be a stretch. \n\nWhile I didn't get the job, my roots got just what they needed -- Plume Therapy. Jenni was booked, I blame myself for that one (fantastic word of mouth press I spouted out for 3+years - now she's booked solid for a month out) but luckily Tina could squeeze me in! \n\nCheating on a hair dresser is just like cheating on a boyfriend. But I honestly didn't feel that bad this time. I knew I was in good hands with Tina and although she hadn't seen me prior to my appointment, she was able to blend my dark roots with my blonde color and even fit in a little trim. My hair hadn't looked this good in months!\n\n I'm now due for another retouch and I feel like I can't bring myself to call my salon in MI... maybe I'll have to fly back to Philadelphia for another last minute appointment!",

  "text": "Thanks Carleen for the wonderful appointment! My mini vacay to Reno is not complete without a visit to Carleen. I don't cut my hair often and usually wait til I have Rapunzel length hair when I see her. Booking an appointment with her is easy but beware..she is normally booked out months in advance and I consider myself lucky if I can score a last minute opening with her (she updates her Facebook often with these openings).\n\nHer studio is super easy to get to (very close to GSR). She always asks in advance your hair inspiration and will talk you through it before she works her magic. She makes you feel at home..drinks, snacks, free wifi, coloring books (for adults), beauty bar and much more.\n\nAnother thing I awesomely appreciate is that..I am not a very social talker and she and her staff make it super comfortable for me here.",

  "text": "This magical store is unquestionably of one my top 5 favorite places in Philadelphia. A tremendous enthusiast for Victorian and Edwardian furnishings, décor and artifacts of all kinds, I was immediately overcome with delight as I stepped in for the first time and, in love with the feeling of being transported to the 19th century, must have lingered for over three hours. If you love Victorian or Edwardian things and/or are partial to the eccentric, you must visit this store. There is nothing quite like it anywhere else in the city, as far as I can tell. One of the reasons I stayed for so long, then, was due to the fact that the majority of their items seem to hail from the Victorian and Edwardian periods, something unusual and wonderful. Another feature that lured me in was the fascinating and bizarre collection of Victorian and Edwardian medical paraphernalia that imparts a sinister, yet intriguing touch to an already intriguing atmosphere--one almost feels one is back in the Mütter museum! Anyone interested in medical history should visit not only the Mütter, but also Anastacia's--there will most certainly be something to excite you, there! There is also eccentric religious paraphernalia in droves, some of which is odd or interesting enough to seem museum-worthy. The last reason I stayed so long and have returned repeatedly has to do with the marvelous customer service I received. Every time I have spent time in Anastacia's, I have been made to feel as though I was welcome and quite at home. Stacy and her husband are delightful and always ready to answer questions with generous insight and grace. Once, when I was interested in trying on a Victorian jacket, she even buttoned me into it (it had a LOT of buttons)! Furthermore, they do not madly mark up their merchandize as many antique stores do, allowing an impecunious student like myself the means to spice up her apartment with some trappings of the Belle Epoque. Excellently curated store--I highly recommend it!",

I believe you can find Crane Lake for $4.99 and there's a host of other cheap standbys at decent prices. If you're in the mood for something a little more posh, you'll still save money.\n\nThe liquor selection is one of the best in town, especially the whiskey. There are some unusual and hard to find bourbons (including ones recently featured in the show Three Sheets) and some expensive and hard to find Irish single malts and special editions.\n\nI'm taking away a star though, because for the size of this store, you would expect them to have a better selection of chilled white wines.",

The coffee is good (middle of the pack in this neighbourhood) and the food smells great, but I guess I don't thing of it as a restaurant and generally I'm not there at meal times.\n\nOur typical time at Remedy is spent talking over a coffee, beer or chai.  It's got a more relaxed atmosphere than the nearby Sugar Bowl and I'd say a more Bohemian vibe than the hipster scene across the street.  It's more conducive to visiting and conversation in the evenings.\n\nThis end of 109 is getting to be quite the evening spot.  There are a couple of sushi spots, a couple of diners, a couple of espresso cafes, a really decent pho place, and with Sugar Bowl and Remedy you can stretch the evening out with drinks and coffee (along with Indian food) before popping into the Garneau for some Art House.",

Rooms are ok they have natural marble floors in the bath rooms. Actual real HDTV on all channels. Free bottles of water in room, by the pool and by the street doors. This hotel is very high load so forget about early check in. We were told it is always 86 percent full and often 100 percent. There is always some kind of event going on with mass loads of business people. We saw some people still waiting for rooms after 4 pm. Beds are decent as are the pillows. Sheets could be a little nicer. The room cleaning is fair at best and they are very slow to clean the rooms due to high occupancy.  It has real central air conditioning. Ask for a room not directly above the Hilton Executive lounge. The Buffett breakfast is pretty decent. The pool is weak and a big downer. The pool is cold, not heated and very boring. We heard many people and kids complain and we went on sunny days in late July. No bar service at the pool. No bar near the pool. No hot tubs anywhere on the property. No indoor pools. There is a Hard Rock Cafe and Landry's Seafood right on the property. Decent location to many St. Louis attractions. Friendly front desk staff.",

You enter a dark, small space with tons of wine, a fridge with beer and a fridge with cheese that you select and they make a board for you. They also manage to have a menu of amazing food.\n\nI came twice in one day. I stopped by at 4pm and found a seat outdoors, listening to some lazy blues live. I tried their shaved brussel sprouts salad with pickled onions, feta, and apple slices. It was perfect and crisp for the hot New Orleans day. I went back, got a second glass of a good pour of red, and their bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo. PERFECTION.\n\nI took a nap and came back with a friend. By then, there was a line out the door but no wait. We just had to show our ID. We grabbed a bottle of wine ($17 for a South American merlot) and went outside. There was no seating so we headed upstairs and were able to watch the people from above. There's also a full bar indoors upstairs. It's fancier in there. They still served food late, which I needed after I drank a whole bottle of wine by myself!\n\nYou will definitely talk to someone here and have interesting conversations so it's a great place to go solo or with friends.",

Staff has always been friendly and service has always been quick. I've only had one problem here which was about a year ago and someone in the group I was with found a hair in their food. Both the waitress and the manager handled the situation. They were extremely apologetic, comped his meal, offered to bring him a new one, plus gave him a coupon for a free meal on his next visit. While finding a hair in your food is bad, it's still not as bad as finding sharp blade in your bread, which I did at another restaurant, and unfortunately, didn't find it until it entered my mouth! But that's for another story! So while it's unfortunate that these things do happen on occasion, at least it was handled well. My coworkers and I will continue to stop in here from time to time.

The thick, homemade, chewy corn tortillas are really the perfect vessel for all that flavor. \n\nThe horchata is also oh-so-refreshing --especially on a hot summer day in Tucson.\n\nMy least favorite was the fish taco. For me, the amount of mayo kinda ruined it for me. But you should definitely try it for yourself because many others rave about it and I'm just not too crazy about fish tacos in general.  The carne asada was also just meh. Was a little dry and under-seasoned.",

  "text": "The saint hotel was a perfect choice for me because I was in town for a family wedding and wanted something a little hipper than the courtyard Marriott next door. We got in late Thursday night starving and found that the perfect spot was the lobby bar. We were starving so we ordered the wings, cheese fries, a burger and some drinks. All of these were amazing. Better yet they had a live band which was amazing. After we ate we headed up to the room taking in all the cool elements. From the lobby decorations to the old school movies in the elevators to the cool lighting in the hallways. The staff was extremely friendly and offered me an umbrella when it was raining. My only complaint was I asked for the room to be cleaned the second day around 11 after the maid came at 9 am and I was still in bed. Front desk assured me they would send someone right up. I come back 5 hours later after touring all day exhausted and the room is still a mess. I decided to go with it. Fast forward next day no maid at the door so I ask again and 6 hours later no such luck. I call again and they send someone an hour later. At this time I needed to get ready for a wedding and needed the room. So yes the hotel is lovely but the maid service could use some better communication.",

As a tried and true member of the 'sit on the couch and watch movies' crowd, Rocks and Ropes has been a fun and interesting place to trick myself into a 'workout'. \n\nI love that each time I come there's a mix of new and old routes. It's great being able to really see my progress (finally got up a 7+!) as well as have something new to try out.  They rate their climbs on a tally system where everyone who climbs a new route can rate it, which is great, but leads to a bit of variation between similarly rated routes. It still makes for a great workout though and you can push yourself to try something a little more difficult each time. \n\nAfter coming here a couple times, my boyfriend and I sprung for the punchcard deal where you get 10 anytime entries + rental. They also have monthly memberships with discounted student, military and family/couple rates as well as a 2-for-1 beginner package for 30 dollars which includes rental and an intro class to climbing for two people.",

This time we got a suite with a jacuzzi, fridge & microwave in the sitting room.  I like that because I can watch tv, while drinking a glass of wine in the jacuzzi.   When we wanted the room cleaned @10am, my husband called the front desk and within 10min, Phil came and couldn't have been more personable & upbeat. Phil gets 5stars!!  He is a very nice asset to his hotel.  We will most likely stay here again.  QVC headquarters is only 4mi away; a fun time :).  The reason I took off one star is because cosmetically the room could use some fixing (I'm not speaking of updating, but rather repairs that need to be addressed) and there is a funky tar smell when u walk through the front door.  Overall, it's a great place to stay.  \n\n(Side note : I debated on whether to give 1 star because there is NO bacon at the breakfast buffet, haha).",

I got the fried shrimps and crinkle fries, my mom had a grilled shrimp and spinach salad. My shrimp were great, fried well and not too much breading. I didn't care too much for the crinkle fries - I've made better from a frozen bag at home. I requested a side of their horseradish chipotle dip (or Texas sauce) and it was a great dipper for the shrimpies. Mom's salad was good too, albeit very simple. One thing though - it is a pet peeve of mine when restaurants do not remove the stems from the spinach leaves. The bacon vinaigrette was very tasty!!

  "text": "In many ways, I'm a creature of habit, and when it comes to dining in Mid City, my \"habits\" are Mandina's and Liuzza's.  I'd been saying for ages that I'd go to @katiesmidcity, and never got past Bienville Street.  I finally did, and I'm a changed person.\n\nKatie's is a classic NOLA neighborhood place; the decor and menu reflect this, right down to the \"Bring the Wood!\" bat (from the Saints' Super Bowl season) hanging up behind the bar.  They've got Abita Amber on tap, cementing my relationship with the place solidly.\n\nMy first trip to Katie's was lunch with a friend.  She grazed on the Grilled Chicken Salad while I had the \"Terranova\" pizza.  More on the pizza later.  It was good, friend was very happy with the salad, and the first visit was a win!  A week or two later, I decided to come back for lunch, and sat at the bar.  I ordered the mushroom-swiss burger with grilled onions.  As you can see, it was a winner, a solid half-pound patty, a good bun, and fresh toppings.  Gotta love the Saints paper lining the basket!  Even though Katie's does a most-excellent burger, that may be the last one I get.  The reason is simple: there are other places that do a good burger and Katie's does so many other things so well.  \n\nThird trip to Katie's was with family for dinner.  They were skeptical-you think I'm bad about Liuzza's?  You should hear my boys.  We started with basic cheese fries (no debris gravy).  The boys both had the hickory burger (hickory sauce, swiss cheese, bacon).  Wife had a shrimp po-boy and I got the fried green tomato and shrimp sandwich.  The boys killed the burgers and wife's sandwich disappeared almost as fast.  I found my sandwich a bit dry, not enough remoulade sauce.  I tweeted as much, and not five minutes later, Chef Scott came by the table to see what was wrong.  I've never seen such a fast reaction in my life!  I was extremely flattered when he offered to bring me some more remoulade sauce (which is one of the best in town, to be sure).  Alas, I had eaten all of the po-boy already.  It wasn't bad, mind you, I just thought it could use more sauce to balance the french bread.  As an appetizer (sans bread), it would've been just right.  The combination of the flavors is fantastic.  If you get this sandwich, though, be sure to ask them for extra remoulade sauce.\n\nMy most recent visit to Katie's was last week, another business lunch.  My colleague had the chicken quesadilla, and I got another Terranova pizza, since the photo of the first one didn't come out well at all.  I'm glad this one did, so not only can I include it in this post, but because I'll be writing a second one where I proclaim this pizza the Best in New Orleans.  Just look at it-wonderful!  Chef Scott did point out that, to make this one hit home with me (I'd been spotted coming in), he brushed the crust with his olive-oil/garlic sauce before putting the marinara on.  (He said anybody can ask for that, btw.)  Even without that extra touch, however, this is a wonderful pizza.  Others I know swear by the Yardbird (chicken, onions, tomato, feta, with the olive oil/garlic sauce), but I refer sausage pizzas when I know it's good sausage.  The Terranova gets its name from Terranova's Supermarket over in Faubourg St. John, and their most wonderful Italian sausage.  \n\nChef Scott also treated us to a wonderful cheesecake for dessert, but alas, my batteries died before I could get a picture.  We'll give dessert a better treatment on the next trip.\n\nKatie's is more than just a solid neighborhood place.  There's some tasty and creative food here.  We go to a neighborhood restaurant for comfort food, or to have a beer with friends.  Katie's is a destination for more than just those things--it's a place for a truly enjoyable dining experience.",

They are so consistent with their food and the quality of everything they use is top notch. From time to time I try a new place just because I live in Metairie and don't want to make the drive uptown but I'm always disappointed that I took the easy way out. All of their dishes have different flavors because the sauces are all made differently. So many Chinese restaurants use the same sauces on different meats or shapes of chicken and give them different names but yet they taste exactly the same. Not August Moon because they prepare and  take pride in the preparation and taste of each and every dish they serve. No more easy way out for this Metairie girl!!",

Their unique flavor combinations leave me wide-mouthed and drooling every time I walk in, and knowing the ice cream isn't filled with potentially harmful hormones and chemicals keeps me coming back. I have been taking my son sometimes weekly for about eight months now and the staff has been friendly, courteous, and helpful every time I have gone. I love that they constantly have new flavor combinations frequently, and flavors that match the seasons and holidays. The first ice cream I tried was a strawberry balsamic. I still dream of the incredible flavor. I honestly tried it on a whim and it's been my favorite flavor ever since. I've also loved their Sangria sorbet, because who wouldn't like a cocktail in the form of a sweet frozen treat, and their Game Day (I think) ice cream; chocolate ice cream with pretzels, potato chips and a few other indulgent ingredients that melted together incredibly well. Other favorites included bourbon & bacon, Rocky Road, pumpkin pie, chocolate with chiles, and one of their regulars that has cake in it.

I had a waffle with syrup; good enough to please me in this moment of hunger.\n\nService was not friendly, but I wasn't expecting much.  Go there if you are completely out of options and are under the influence.  I know for me, otherwise, I wouldn't have liked it!",

The chips and salsa are perfect (yay for cilantro), especially when the chips are hot and fresh.\n\nMy favorites are the fajita quesadilla or yolandas, and the lunch prices cannot be beat. Service can be variable at peak times (if the parking lot is full, you may be in for a wait), but the staff tends to be accommodating and attentive.\n\nMi Ranchito is not innovating the Mexican menu, but they are delivering predictability on a platter, which always gives independents the edge over chain casual dining.",

I have a feeling that the hard seating surfaces are easier to keep clean or something, which is important, but sheesh.  That said, the interior (right down to the hard seating) is freaking awesome.  Look at those high-chairs made out of pipe and wood.  Neat prohibition theme!\n\nNice selection of beers, and I'd never heard of mules before, but they have 'em and they're tasty!\n\nHad the Wiseguy Fries as an appetizer.  Fries, nacho cheese, BBQ pulled pork (if I remember right), sour creme, and some green onion.  Served in a great big bucket.  Yummy.\n\nI had the bucket burger with the chipotle sauce.  Amazing!  Came with fries... now these are the same fries used in the awesome appetizer, right?  Now I'm a bit of a fry nazi... I want mine more... turgid.  These were... flaccid.  Tasted good, though.  Just not my thing.\n\nWe also got a chicken wrap that looked good.  I didn't try it, but it came with chips and salsa.  The salsa is better than the salsa at the Mexican place down the street, and also had a bit of kick.  I expected something more bland from a brewhouse, I guess.  Nice job!\n\nWill totally eat here whenever I want a beer and some yummy stuff to go with  it!",

We flew into Nashville and there is a shuttle but it's $30 per person round trip. taxi's are $25 plus $1 for each additional person. We found another  person going to the hotel that shared the cab so it was about $10 per person after tip.\n\nCheck in. We over 3000 people attending check in was hectic but the hotel had several people handling the check in and it went about was well as one could expect.\n\nThe rooms. spacious and comfortable. Our room overlooked the atrium and had a small balcony with a small table and 2 chairs. I would definitely recommend a room on the atrium side. Nice big screen tv, fridge, and microwave. Free internet which I am using as I write this. A little slow for a small fee you can get faster internet.\n\nFood. Very good, especially when we had lunch buffets. Restaurants are good but rather pricey. \n\nFacilities. Plenty of room for our large group. the only hiccup was there were some internet problems during some of the presentations but that could have been operator error.\n\nStaff. Very friendly\n\nThis resort is nice but pricey. Nice for a special occasion or convention.

Thankfully they removed it from my bill & were very apologetic, but I will never again order based on an IHOP commercial :P",

  "text": "My family and I (there was 8 of us) ordered about 8 things & we sat at three tables that were next to each other & just kept passing the desserts around to taste each thing. \n\nThe place was super cute, but the desserts were disappointing & expensive. Plus the place was packed. \n\nGood:\nThe strawberry cheesecake, chocolate peanut butter pie, and chocolate peanut butter brownie were good, but for the price.... moving on.\n\nNot so good:\nThe Carmel cake looks so nice, but it was real dry and just not that good. The berry bread pudding was huge, like it was just this big square of sponginess. The bread pudding was too wet and it tasted kind of funny so I'm thinking it was just the berries in it- I'm not so use to berry bread pudding. The Marie Antoinette wasn't good at all, but I will say that I've never had one before, so it could be just because I don't like that particular dessert overall. \n\n\nGreat:\nThe cookie and cookie Ice box cake were sooo delicious, still pricy, but they were the bomb. The cream on the ice box cake was sweet and went so well with the thick chewy ( not too chewy) cookie. It was about the only thing I ate.\n\nToo expensive, some stuff is good, other stuff isn't good, and it's gorgeous inside.",

I saw one clerk scooping seafood up with his bare hands into a bag.  YUCK!  The instructions for cooking the chicken were not all there.  I had to guess as to what it said.  Needless to say, the chicken was terrible.  The ground beef I made into patties.  When I cooked them on the grill they dripped slimmy stuff and looked gross.  I wish I had put more seasoning on them, cause there were tasteless.\n\nOverall, I should have taken the $20 I spent on the Groupon for this place and invested it at The Fresh Market where I usually go.",

I will say that the steaks looked delicious and my dad's was exactly as he ordered it - medium rare. However, avoiding red meat for the evening, my selection was limited to fried chicken, more fried chicken, and greasy (but moist and yummy, albeit salty) rotisserie chicken. It seemed like 75% of the selection available was fried or drowned in grease. The fried okra was over cooked and chewy. The \"fresh grilled corn on the cob\" was clearly boiled in water. The fresh vegetable selection was lacking and healthy meat options were non existent. What looked like a hockey puck seemed to be some burnt beef of some kind? All in all, I certainly don't feel as if I got $12 worth of food (and I prefer quality over quantity). I left feeling like the kitchen staff just gave up and threw everything in the deep fryer or pot of boiling water or microwave, but I'm not in the back to know what they did. Unfortunately, I think I'm done giving this place its chances.",

You can read as many books as you want, but nothing compares to seeing it first hand, touching it, and talking about it.  \n\nThe actors that work at Fort Edmonton are a lot of fun too.  It's not just an educational place, it's a place of fun and entertainment too!\n\nI would definitely recommend a visit to Fort Edmonton to anyone visiting Edmonton or for any Edmontonians who haven't been there before.",

  "text": "I met a friend here for lunch today she had the pasta special and I had the pulled pork with sweet potato chips. We were greeted by the friendly owner who explained we order at the bar and can sit anywhere we like, we chose a booth in the bar area , at first we were told we could help ourselves to the drinks but as time went on we really didn't need to because the very attentive staff kept offering to get it for us which was nice. So now the review\n\n1) service, friendly and often we didn't have to wait long at all for our food or to be asked if we needed anything so service gets 5 stars\n\n2) the menu is limited at lunchtime but both my food and my friends tasted fresh I just found it odd that the pulled pork had no sauce it was still good just not what I was expecting and the homemade chips were really good too.  We also had dessert we had the chocolate truffle and creme brûlée both were tasty just on the small side for sharing. So overall I'd give the taste a 4 star the selection and portions 3 stars.\n\n3) We were able to hear each other speak which is always a plus in my book and the place was very clean, not super busy at 11am but I did notice there were private parties so it could be a nice spot for holiday parties too.\n\nTip: on Saturdays you can park in the lot behind the building even though the sign says after 5 per the owner. \n\nTip 2: they have punch cards so when you go ask for one and once the punches are filled you get a free sandwich \n\nTip 3 they do take reservations \n\nOverall we liked the place and the service, I would like to see a little more on the selections for lunchtime but I will go back , so Ill still give them 4 stars",

It's a neat restaurant with cool atmosphere and very friendly service, but I feel like it's overrated. While they claim they have a large draft beer selection (and they do), not one beer is recognizable. The menu wasn't much better -- the $11+ burger selection is pretty out there and they don't come with any sides, those are ordered separately. After eating we all said it was nothing outstanding and we agreed the fries were the best part of the entire meal... And they were just fries, nothing special themselves.

The vibe is very upscale and the service is impeccable. We ordered the cheese plate to start which was rich and varied in taste. the Prosciutto was delicious and was excellently paired with cheeses. For dinner, we ordered the black spaghetti pasta which had just a hint of lobster. It was incredibly unique and tasted very different than any pasta dish I'd had previously. The lobster was not overpowering and was a wise addition for this classic. We also ordered the market fish. It was well done and expertly paired with sides.

  "text": "No Yelp Elite member reviews yet? Hmm, okay, let me take a stab at it. \n\nI had bought a Groupon for Dawna Ara and it was soon to expire. So I tried calling but I didn't get a response. In the voicemail, she prompted to book via the website. You check the website and the only date that was available was the day after the Groupon's expiration date.\n\nHmm...Plan B.\n\nDecides to email her directly and email Groupon just in case I can't use it. Groupon responsed and said they would give me credit in Groupon money if I never used the deal. Dawna also responded and after exchanging a few emails, we had settled on a date.  So if you have problem getting through her, I would say email is the way to go.\n\nThe date arrived and finding this place wasn't too difficult via GPS. However, it's a residential building and does not have any company name posted. Look for the house with the little white fence.  I walked in and just saw candles lit and chairs with literature on the table. I also saw an Iphone but I figured that was hers. I was finally greeted by Dawna after what looks like the owner of the building came in and shut the door. \n\nDawna does everything herself. So there's a bit of a wait before, during, and after the session. This was my first time at acupuncture and I actually did feel something working immediately after I finished the treatment. I came in for multiple ailments but she concentrated on the main aspect of my problem. BTW, the treatment was relaxing since I was lying down for 30 minutes but the actual treatment was a little bit shorter than I expected compare to the other reviewers. Also the massage was a bit shorter than I expected. Nevertheless, this place should be tranquil enough after she updates it with some furnishings since it is really bare at the moment. Thus, not bad for the Groupon rate. Note to add, if you ever check out the bathroom, it feels a bit slanted.",

Besides, this was down from Waffle House , which was packed and we didn't feel like waiting. \n\nThe exterior clearly states they do Breakfast, lunch and dinner. They building itself doesn't lend itself to say it's a restaurant. If your turning in right off David dr, you will not make the turn into the main parking lot if there are cars parked right there. You will have to back up and turn in more to make it in. It was a weird setup especially if your driving a truck. Once you park, the only door on that side is not the entrance, you have to walk back around to the side you drove I. On and enter there. Another weird setup. \n\nUpon entering, you will see everything is just 1 big open room. They do not seat you. You seat yourself, grab a menu and place your order with the cashier. You pay first. I don't tip before my meal is served so I opt to leave a tip after I'm done eating. \n\nThere is a drink station for getting your once soft drinks and coffee.  The food is delivered to your table by servers.\n\nOverall, the food was better than I expected it would be. I could do without the fried frozen home fries. I'm more of a grilled in the pan potatoes.  I got the French toast breakfast with 2 eggs and home fries. The French toast was only 1 piece of bread cut in half. I was surprised with that. I thought it would be a standard 2. They were out of regular syrup so had to use sugar-free syrup. \n\nIf you drink coffee with Splenda. They do not carry it. \n\nPrices were reasonable and we plan on returning to try out dinner.",

  "text": "In New Orleans for a couple of nights, the Valet at my hotel recommended Grand Isle to me because they're having a promo this month of oysters for $.55/each!  How can you pass that up in this town?  I couldn't and made the quick two block walk there.  I sat at the bar and downed a dozen oysters pretty quick.  I also had one of the most delicious beers; a NOLA Blond Ale, and it was so cold  (and it was so hot outside) that I wanted to jump in it, but I drank it instead!  The oysters were great, and then I had a Shrimp PoBoy, which turned out to be a little much.  I couldn't eat the bread on this sandwich, so I just ate the fixin's.  Another NOLA, and by the time I was done, I was DONE!\n\nYou may find me back here again tomorrow night, grabbing another dozen oysters, before heading out into the French Quarter for adventures unknown...",

  "text": "Been here a few times due to proximity and good food. There can only be one best taco so it's not that. It is predictable and good. Actually, the enchilada is worth the visit. We had a brisket enchilada (al a carte is not on the menu but an option), a veriety of 3 tacos and a side of the tots. I'm a big fan of tots... These are not 'traditional' tots, though. Good but not what I had envisioned. The flavor of the tacos is somewhat bold so distinct between each variety. I've had all a few times and don't really have a favorite. Out of the shrimp last night which was a bummer. I'm okay with a restaurant being out of something though if it's due to buying fresh and being busy. Bit loud but heat worked well so not cold. NFL game playing if your into that. If you haven't tried them, worth a visit. I'll be back. Go eat!",

  "text": "Great music shop and definitely worth the drive if you're visiting Central Florida. The front of the store is well organized and great for the average music collector. It has both new and used vinyl, CD's, and DVD's. The back of the store is where the fun begins and where the serious music collector will want to go. The back is stocked full of thousands (10's of thousands) of vinyl LP's, 12'' and 7'' singles at great bargain prices. I spent about 8 hours there and only got through a fraction of the stock. The back is organized by format and basic genre with average prices ranging from $.50 to $3 per record. They have listening stations for both vinyl and CD so you can test out any new weird things you find. I ended up finding so much stuff that I had to ship it home (too many records too fit in my luggage). Overall, this is a great shop that is well worth the drive if you're in the state of Florida. Great selection of music with a super friendly (and honest) staff. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Florida!",

  "text": "Coco's Cocina is right across the street from the Broadway Theatre of Pitman and next to Sweet Lula's, a nice, traditional Italian restaurant owned by the same couple. But you really don't need these directions. You'll easily find Coco's while driving down the street. You can't miss the glamorous, flashy, bright red signage. It's right in the heart of town.\n\nWalk in to find a BYO, seat-yourself establishment and offers a seriously affordable menu. Chips and salsa, or guac, or queso, run about $4. All entrees (regular or wet burritos, tacos any style,  quesadillas, etc., with preferred protein/veg) are $9 and come with rice and your choice of pinto or refried beans. Keep in mind it IS \"Tex-Mex\" in that nothing is overly spicy; therefore, it is a good eatery for folks who don't mix it up much with their diets or want a \"tame\" meal. You can add hot sauce, however.\n\nThe vibe inside is very relaxed with a good number of tables and a food truck mural with a window that peeks into the kitchen. A jingle rings each time food is sitting and ready to be served. Mexican sodas, regular fountain pours, and virgin margaritas are available as drink options.\n\nSo originally here (before writing all that basic info), I included the long story of the visit with my mom from earlier this week. But it bored me so I deleted it. Basically the experience culminated with owner/chef/puppeteer/entertainer Anthony Asbury sitting at our table coaxing her to eat churros for the first time. It was hilarious but probably one of those \"you had to be there\" moments. But I will say that both owners are super friendly/funny/accommodating, and those qualities clearly align with their effective business operations.\n\nMy mom and I split the chips and queso app to start. Both the chips and the dip were delicious. No kick. If you want queso with a kick, go down the street to the other Mexican spot in town.\n\nFor my meal, I had the chicken tinga quesadilla. Again, no kick, nothing fancy, but just good, gooey toasted tortilla with chicken. The addition of sour cream with lettuce on the side was nice. I also really enjoyed my rice and would probably ask to get two sides of it instead of the beans in the future.\n\nMy mom had the pork carnitas tacos. The entree comes with three, and you get your choice of shell. She went with crispy, and liked them. As mentioned, she also had the churros (with Jack Daniel's bourbon butterscotch sauce) and ate them all rather quickly despite complaints of them being \"too hot.\" I had a bite and would definitely save more room for them in the future.\n\nI really enjoyed my first visit to this new spot in Pitman. It's good for any occasion and will likely hold a spot in my take-out rotation.",

Libation- summer daiquiri, excellent cocktail.For dinner I had the strip steak and my husband had the pork schnitzel. My steak was grilled to perfection and the schnitzel was perfect. The slaw that comes with the schnitzel was delicious. My only observation was my steak s a little cold but the flavor and tenderness of the steak made up for the coldness of the steak. \nFor dessert we had the lemon olive oil cake. Perfection \nThe only reason why this is not 5 star is because the steak was cold.",

  "text": "I ate at Rotten Ralph's on Sunday, February 21, and I cannot explain how much I regret it. I can confidently say that this is absolutely one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in my LIFE.  The experience was unsatisfactory from beginning to end and I can honestly say that I have never been so disrespected in my life as a customer.  We sat upstairs and our waitress (some girl who seemed out of it with short, mousy brown hair and an enormous attitude) was rude to begin with, then proceeded to take 10 minutes to bring our drinks and ended up messing up our order.  My sister and I specifically ordered eggplant parmesan, which the waitress must have repeated back to us 4 times.  She then brought us chicken parmesan, and as she handed it to us she said, \"here's your chicken parmesan\" So of course I said, \"this is chicken? I ordered eggplant, remember?\" and she said \"I'm sorry, you're right, it's eggplant\".  As a trusting customer, I took her at her word and began to eat my food, which was in fact CHICKEN! My sister was upset, but could deal.  I on the other hand am a strict vegetarian and have not eaten meat in over 10 years. Until that night. I was furious at this careless waitress and of course did not eat anything.  We then explained to the girl what she had done and asked politely for her to take the chicken parmesan's off our check.  She rudely told us  that we had to wait for her manager, who was at the store.  We waited for 10 minutes and when we couldn't wait any longer due to the fact that we had somewhere else to be and were already running late because of her mistake, we said \"can you please just fix this and explain to your manager later?\".  At this point, the waitress and another waitress who was standing with her became extremely inappropriate, telling us they won't help us, it's our problem, and leave if we can't wait.  This type of shocking exchange continued until the manager finally showed up a few minutes later.  He was just as rude, telling us \"fine, what do you want me to do, take the chicken parms off your bill? Fine then.\"  As he was bombarding us with HIS rudeness, his two waitresses were standing behind him, staring us down and mouthing at my mother and sister and I the word \"b****\" over and over again! Obviously we were completely shocked and when we told him what they were doing, he DENIED that they would do that and said we were out of line for suggesting such a thing! He then proceeded to say to my sister and mother and I, \"ladies, leave this to the men to handle (my father was there as well), you are obviously incapable of dealing\".  There was no getting through to these exceptionally RUDE individuals.  I will write a negative review on every single website I can and I will call the local newspapers, and Better Business Bureau, etc.  If I could give this place negative stars I would.  Their staff is disrespectful, they are insolent and no one in their right mind should support them. Hey, at least they stay true to their name.  Rotten Ralph's is indeed employing ROTTEN employees, making for quite the ROTTEN experience.",

How often can you say that about any sort of auto service?  I received a call from Tim at 10:30 letting me know the tires were in and we scheduled a same day appointment for 3 pm.  No waiting for days on end!  The car was taken in shortly after my arrival and all four tires were mounted and balanced in about 30 minutes.  While waiting I observed 30 minutes worth of highly professional and friendly service, then had the pleasure of chatting with Tim for a few minutes.  Great price on the installation ($20 per tire) with absolutely no hidden charges or unnecessary work pushed on me.  Though this car does need an inspection and the plan is to take it back to Havertown T&S after this experience.",

I had terrible allergies or a cold when I woke up in the morning and on a lark, I searched for Chinese foot massage hoping to stimulate my immune system. Turns out this place is right down the street from my parents house so I decided to go on the off chance they could take me a s a walk in. They did! Super clean, quiet, and very similar to what I get in Oakland chinatown near where I live. The massage started off very light so I asked them to massage harder. I want to feel the pain in the areas I need help but I suspect the local clientele doesn't like that...hence the kid glove touch. But once I asked for more pressure, I got it.  Thank you so much for the great massage. Really wish I could get SF/Bay Area prices here but $35 for an hour still ain't that bad. I'll be back at xmas!",

Happy hour oysters are fresh, cold, and the perfect size raw(and the perfect price at 50¢.) The fried oysters are also worth the price at $1 apiece, and are so flavorful that you could skip the sauce if you wanted(but that is excellent, as well.) Drinks are half price(I get the River Bend...Okay, I got 3,) which is a really good deal for a craft cocktail at under $5. Another favorite is the salad Luke; I'm not a salad eater, but the beets are spectacularly sweet, the lettuce is actually beautiful, and it's dressed just right. The servers are really friendly/personable and attentive(our guy switched a wobbly table for us even though we didn't ask or complain,) and they even check on you to let you know that it's getting close to the end of happy hour, so you can get in more orders at the special prices. The only people that are a little lacking are the girls at the front; they always look us up and down and make me as if we need to pass inspection, but once you've been seated, the rest of the experience is wonderful. This will be one of my regular places to eat during oyster season. Just don't tell too many people, b/c it's getting awfully crowded.",

We were bumped in to by servers and guests alike as we waited to find a seat. When we were seated we noticed that our table was wobbling just to see sugar packets that were stacked underneath the legs of the table. \nDeciding not to worry so much about the discomfort of the table, and to really focus on the food and drinks - I decided to order the recommended dishes that were \"signature\" to Limoncello. My drink was too sweet and my entre was not even memorable. We ended up leaving directly after dinner and spending the rest of the night at another bar/restaurant in the city.",

  "text": "Came here early on a Friday night; it was not too crowded.  If you sit inside, the tables are communal so you may be tight on elbow room.  There are also counters.  We ordered the melanzana pizza and the italian caesar salad. The pizza was soggy. When you lifted a slice off by the crust (as you normally would when eating pizza) all the toppings slide off.  It was disappointing.  The flavors were good; but the sogginess of the pie made me wonder how come this place has gotten such rave reviews.  I looked around and the other diners appeared to have non-soggy pizza.  They were actually holding the crust and biting into the pizza, whereas we were scooping our toppings off the plate.  So perhaps it is just this style of pizza that needs help.  I don't know.  I suspect that the pizza was made beforehand; dough rolled out too thin.  The soggy part of the pizza was also cold.  I'm definitely not coming back and actually would have given this place 1 star, but the waiter was nice and when we mentioned they could improve their soggy pizza they offered us a complimentary soft serve.  That was delicious, but not enough to change my mind about coming back for the pizza.  Also, there were egg shells in our salad.  So overall I question the quality of the food here.",

I ordered the Hickory Smoked 2 Meat plate - brisket and pulled pork.  Unfortunately, I was overwhelmed by the barbeque sauce.  It was incredibly sweet and completely overtook the taste of the meat.  I want to be able to experience the quality of the meat, as well as have a great sauce that compliments it.  Instead, it felt like, \"would you like a little meat with your sauce?\"  I'm disappointed because I was really hoping that this place would be great.",

You have to be operating a restaurant exceptionally to stay in business that long. \n\nThe hospitality, ambiance, and food are excellent. Definitely one of the finer Italian restaurants in the Delaware Valley. You can't get a bad meal here. The waiters are old school, with a slight attitude, but in a nice South Philly way - it's all part of the experience. The sauces are as good as it gets - done right...very authentic.\n\nVery nice bar scene too w/ piano player.",

That's incredible!\n\nThe chicken tacos are a little messy, but they are honestly divine for a taco that you can eat as much as want.  The beef tacos are pretty good too, but trust me, try the chicken tacos if you ever get all you can eat.\n\nNow, I can understand the less generous reviews about this place if you aren't going for all you can taco Tuesdays.  The food is ok, nothing spectacular but is a little bit on the pricey side.  Sometimes the waiters/waitresses are really good, courteous, polite and friendly, but other times they're the complete opposite.\n\nAnyways, if you're a college student looking to eat a lot for a little, or you can just eat a lot, or even if you just like tacos a lot, I'd definitely recommend coming here on Tuesdays and getting their all you can eat tacos.  If you're looking for gourmet Mexican cuisine, then I suggest looking elsewhere.",

So Tuesday I call and they promise someone will be out on Wednesday. Well, Wednesday comes...and goes...and no one shows up or even gives the courtesy of a phone call. So Thursday comes and I'm on the phone 3 times trying to get someone to replace the \"new\" aqua cafe machine. I am again told that someone will be out by 5 today. Of course, 5 comes and goes and by this time it has been 3 days of no coffee or water for a law office of about 15 employees. I called them for the 4th time and told them to come and get their equipment and cancel our service. They told me someone would be here Monday to get all the stuff. But here's the real kicker! Here it is Friday and they just had someone here to pick up the unit. HAHAHAHA The very next day...and we had been waiting 3 days for someone to just fix it for us! WORST SERVICE EVER!

  "text": "My boyfriend calls this, \"the place where you can park wherever you want\". Yes, their parking lot has no lines and is a little \"free-for-all\". Yes, there are cheesy 80's posters of a panther walking in front of the NYC skyline. And yes, their food is well worth the sketchiness!\n\nI normally get the bbq pork bun with eggroll and go crazy with all the hot chili oils and spicy condiments they provide. Their bun is much better than Miss Saigon's across the parking lot. They also have good pho, and I like that you can order it in a small since the bowls are so huge. I think that I like the broth at Miss Saigon better, but the meat quality/quantity better at KG.\n\nThey also have a great egg/shrimp/pork pancake appetizer that my bf loves and delicious cold rice-paper spring rolls. I always end with a Vietnamese iced coffee which are to die for. I don't drink coffee and I will never leave this place without one because they are so perfect; not too sweet, not too bitter (ala Starbucks), just smooth french coffee heaven!\n\nFYI they only accept cash, but for two people you won't spend much more than $20.",
