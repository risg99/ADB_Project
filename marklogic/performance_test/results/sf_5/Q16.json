  "text": "The food is good... not that good but good... and I am all about supporting local business... however with that said I will NEVER EVER order from them again cause the Italian gruff man that takes the orders knows NOTHING about customer service, he yells over the phone he has a complete lack of knowledge when it come to customer service, politeness, respect and or anything regarding interactions with the public.  He is rude and needs to sit the fuck down and let someone else take orders if he wants return business.  This review is long over due since this is not the first time this mean rude MFer has disrespected me and my family. I will not be subjected to this blatant BS just for a pizza... there are too many places in this area for us to ever interact with this ahole again.  I didn't want to give him any stars but there's no option for that... can you say a slice with a side of shittiness... no thanks... please go jump off a bridge.",

  "text": "I'm currently at the airport in philly. the service at terminal e is not very good. check number 2270 started off asking for a beer  not sure what I wanted  ordered came in a real big glass then realized there were small pint size  bartender never ask what size I wanted just gave me larger size just to run up tab. then I ordered food ask if fries came with she said no then I ask for side of fries. when food came philly came first just set in front of me never said anything g walked away I said I was suppose to get fries sId on there way philly was more bread then meat was not very good. when fries got there they were not a side but an appetizer  i was talking with customer next to me about size and borrowed menu fries were 8 dollars wow I said excuse me to the bartender that was standing with her back turned doing paperwork so she could leave she said that's the only way they came I said I ask for a side but she never told me they only came that way again felt like the were just trying to run the tab higher. I said I dont want them she said ok took fries and dumped them in trash never sorry or anything.  so she said to me a bit later have a good day and took her stuff and left. so I ask the next bartender for a manager. manager came I explained the problem as I was talking the girl bartender came up and I told her that I've been in service industry for years and said you should ask what size beer and explain that they dont do sides. as I was asking some other bartender that was ringing up a item in pos system said everyone else does the same thing with a attitude. I said I beg your pardon manager said dont worry about her. really  that employee should be fired. anyway I said I really deal like your just trying to get as much as you can from me because I'm at airport he said that's correct. wow again. I will never eat there again and worn everyone watch out they dont care about you. sorry was hoping for a better experience.  manager did adjust my large beer and buy me one but still deal cheated. I've never done a review before has to be bad for me to rant like this.",

  "text": "I was actually really surprised to not like this place because I love Chinese food and have heard great things and read great reviews. The service was awesome but the food really wasn't. I wanted to like it so bad that I feel guilty for writing it but I have to be honest. The service and staff were amazing ( totally sweet and accommodating to our baby. It's a tiny place but they squeezed us in with a high chair and were very nice!) but the food was just ok. Pot stickers were tasty. I had pork chow fun with no gravy and it was relatively flavorless and kind of greasy. I don't usually say food is greasy cause I don't usually mind it and also it's like duh it's Chinese food did you think you were eating healthy? But it was like too much. Maybe better with the gravy? But the gravyless looked so yummy in the pictures! Husband got roasted duck with stir fried noodles and honestly it tasted the same as mine other than the flavor of the duck. Kinda flavorless and greasy. So weird considering all the great things I've heard! An off night? Got the wrong dishes? Maybe but two dishes being not tasty is odd I could see one but both...hmmm?! I will give them another shot though considering all the good I've heard and hope for a different experience.",

  "text": "We have been going to Bloomingdale Animal Hospital for as long as we have had dogs, 10+ years, for their low prices and location convenience. But after the way they treated an emergency situation, we will NEVER go there again. I don't know if it was lack of education on their part or lack of care, but either way, I will never trust them with my animals again. We have a miniature Dachshund who is 10 years old and one morning woke up screaming crying in pain, I rushed her to the vet right away and they took blood work, exams, and gave me anti inflammatory medicine and pain killers. After paying an arm and a leg, they told me they have no idea what's wrong with her and to check back in after a week. A few days later her pain was getting worse and not better, so I rushed her back in to get re-examined. After paying another arm and a leg, they told me it could be cancer but they are not completely sure, and she might have to be put down and just upped the medication and sent me on my way. Thank goodness my Dachshund got worse over the weekend, because this place was unavailable so I rushed her to the ER Vet Blue Pearl, where within minutes they diagnosed her with a COMMON DACHSHUND DISEASE CALLED IVDD. They immediately got her on the correct medication and treatment process and within weeks my dachshund was better, happy, and healthy. BLOOMINGDALE ANIMAL HOSPITAL TOLD ME SHE MIGHT DIE- and if they would have accurately diagnosed her the first time she would have been better weeks earlier instead of sitting in unimaginable pain. They either didn't care about my dachshunds life and wanted the extra money, didn't know a common disease which worries me about their overall education, or didn't take the time to genuinely care about my dachshunds pain. DO NOT GO TO THEM, YOUR DOGS CARE IS WORTH PAYING SLIGHTLY MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

  "text": "We bought the membership program for plumbing, electrical and air conditioning. They would come out periodically to check, but it was only just an excuse to try to sell us new and unnecessary parts. \n\nAfter calling to cancel the $35 per month charge, I was told I had to send a written request by email or regular mail, and it would take 30 days for it to be cancelled. Of course that means they get another payment out of me. \n\n30 days?  Sleezeb. Look at the reviews of this company both here and at BBB. \n\nIN ANSWER TO YOUR COMMENT. \n\nWhen we had the condenser fan stopped due to lightening in our air conditioning, we again had to listen to a selling speel before he would replace it. This was a unit that was less than 5 yrs old because it was still under warranty for the original installation. \n\nHigh pressure sale. Greatly inflated prices \n\nYou came out once about our heater during your annual checkup in 2016.  We were told there was a tiny gas leak which he fixed after first telling us all about the expensive systems that we should buy before fixing it. The heater is still working fine in 2018.  Plus he looked at our air intake on the heating/cooling intake. Found a birds nest, but he said he was unable to get it out, they suggested punching a hold in the side wall for a new intake system. I went to hardware store, bought a snake, and cleaned it out myself  \n\nTake a look at the BBB reviews of this company.",

After owning several true religion jeans i purchased a pair from this store that bagged out after wearing for just over an hour and it started to lose shape. I called the store and explained the issue and advised that i removed the tags to wear the jeans but needed to return or exchange them due to them bagging out after such a short time. I was advised there is no way to return or exchange jeans once the tag is removed and i was referred to read the return policy on the receipt. I again explained i own several jeans the same size and have not had this issue before . How would i know the jeans would not fit so poorly unless I wore them? $130 is too much to not be able to return of something does not work. Another true religion store accepted the jeans and could not believe it was so stretchy.  They explained there are quality differences in jeans made for outlet locations.",

  "text": "Was recommended this place by a hotel employee while visiting Philly on my last day of the trip.  First thing I noticed was how quiet it was.  There were a few others dining there but the music was very low, which kind of made the vibe uncomfortable.  Our waiter (I think his name was David) hovered way too much for my liking as if we were a nuisance.  I ordered the lamb sliders and mac and cheese.  They were both delicious and cooked to perfection.  Once the bill arrived it was combined for me friend and I.  (why do restaurants assume to female friends who are dining wouldnt be paying separately?)  Anywho, I asked, can you separate the bills.  To which David replied I can do it myself and itemize the bill and list which card was paying for which, this REALLY ticked me off.  So as I sat there trying to separate each of our orders, drinks and taxes he literally stood over my should, not to offer any assistance but to rush me.  We felt like we were intruding just by dining there.  Plus side, is there were great picture ops on the deck.IF I return when visiting Philly again, I'd definitely ask for a different waiter.",

  "text": "Wish we could give this dealership a 5 star. We have been a customer since 2006. Unfortunately, due to a lack of communication I have to give them a 2 Star. This past weekend we felt that we were basically held hostage at the dealership for over 5 hours to complete our deal when it should have taken an hour. We are residence in Alabama. However, we called our sales person, Brad, down at Maher Chevrolet to get a deal done for us. He is an exceptional salesman and it's because of him that I didn't grade this to a 1 star. We had been corresponding with him for weeks and was told we had been approved and to come get our truck. We sent the money down last Monday. We arrived this past Saturday to get the truck. We met Brad who told us he was passing us on to Matthew Berry, because we were getting a brand new truck. He is a new car salesman. We test drove the truck and we were glad with the deal. So we go inside to sign the paperwork. He advised they were printing it out. He went over Chevrolet Mylink and points and all of the usual. Then he leaves to check on the deal. He returns 30 minutes later to ask for references. We quickly wrote those down and he takes it again and then he disappears. Mind you we had been driving since 2:30 am, got there around 1pm. We are tired and want to get this done. He keeps coming back saying we are almost done. Then he asks for bank statements and proof of address. We printed all of that out. Mind you we have been there almost 3 hours now. We brought lunch with us in our cooler so we go and warm it up and eat it in the kitchen. He comes and finds us and says yet again they are almost done. We get done with eating and they still aren't done. We go to take a nap in our car that we drove up in for almost an hour. Brad comes walking by and he asks why are we still here. We tell him we have no clue. He goes to find out. Then Matthew comes out and says we are going with another bank then what we were approved for. So it's taking time to negotiate. This bank wants $900 more down then what we have already paid. He said he will be back. He comes back 10 minutes later and says we were able to get you approved through GM Financial now so no need to pay it. Then he says we are waiting to hear from them or we can just take the deal with the other bank and pay the additional $900. Mind you we have been here over 5 hours. With us leaving to return home at 4am we didn't have time to wait nor did we trust them at this point to return the next day. So we went ahead and wrote a check for the $900, signed and drove off. While we were in the finance office the kind financial lady was kind enough to let us know why we were there so long. She stated that her boss told the sales people that we were approved when all he received was a pre-approval. The deal should have gone to a different finance manager. That finance manager unfortunately didn't even see the deal until we got there even though they had our money 6 days earlier. She stated it was Matthew Berry's manager who kept us there and someone should have told us that the approval they thought they had wasn't a real approval. She further stated that she was working on a deal with GM Financial which the rep approved, but the manager at GM would not. She stated she asked them not to tell us. Yet again we didn't learn the first time. They came and told us. She advised she knew right away it wasn't approved. Yet that also wasn't relayed to us. In the end of all of this we finally were able to get the truck. Sadly, we were not able to visit our elderly grandmother or any family. Had they communicated then we could have left the dealership, took a shower, visited relatives and even took a cat nap. Instead we were kept hostage and lied to over and over. A manager came to say they were sorry. After being there for over 5 hours I'm sorry isn't going to cut it. People that do this on a daily basis don't know the difference between an approval and a pre-approval. When it was done one time you do it again. Get it together Maher!",

  "text": "Food is outstanding, but the decor and service are deplorable. We were a party of eight on a Thursday night with a 7pm reservation, and the restaurant was a ghost town. The uncomfortable chairs with the dollar store seat cushions  were from an average reception hall, the table uneven because of the extended leaves transforming a square table to round and unless you are seated by a window, you could be in any average restaurant. The staff were dressed for a rodeo, clumsy and untrained, randomly picking up and dropping off dishes. The trendy, hipster manager spent more time smiling at his cell phone than engaging with guests. The average price of an entree was $35 with an a-la-carte option for salad and garnish. The only included item was the bread that was as fresh as the rolls at the box grocery stores.  Again, while the entrees were well above average, the rest of this experience is labeled a tourist trap and I doubt locals visit often unless they have a disposable income and overlook the lack of attention or concern to guest experiences.",

  "text": "I normally love this place, but tonight my Sea Bass was not thoroughly cooked and they had to take it back to finish. I didn't notice it was under cooked until after a few bites and then I told our server. She completely agreed so that part was not a problem. I was just surprised that they took the fish off my plate and back to the kitchen to cook further instead of taking my entire plate. Having the rest of my food and my utensils on the plate with under cooked fish made me nervous. I also was surprised that they didn't offer some sort of complimentary food or price break. When the Sea Bass was returned to me it was over cooked. Not horrible but enough that it was somewhat dry and tough. I will probably never return to Brophy's after this experience. I also sampled the clam chowder and it was very salty. I think this restaurant has gone downhill. Too bad. It used to be a great restaurant known for their freshness.",

  "text": "I don't like leaving poor reviews for restaurants, but unfortunately this location deserves one. \n\nYou walk in and the only menu you can order from is a folded-up takeout menu that was somewhat greasy from previous patrons. The cashiers were cordial, but problems with the order either fell upon the cashiers taking the order incorrectly or staff making food improperly. \n\nI had multiple people in my party order everything from pizza to sandwiches to the wings and nothing was up to par. We were asked what sauce we wanted on the wings, but when the \"wings\" were served, they gave no sauce. When we asked them to fix it, we were given a dipping cup.\n\nThe sandwich was properly made, but it was somewhat undercooked and fell apart after the first bite. That could be the mark of a juicy sandwich, but in this case it was just shoddily put together.\n\nThe pizza itself was passable, but not terribly great for a namesake dish. The one silver lining had to be the drink machine, which really shouldn't ever be a silver lining for any situation.\n\nThe rest of the atmosphere was fine, if a little strange. There were an abundance of large TVs, but you would think at least one of them would be in Full HD (they aren't). The sliding glass door is always open, but I'm not sure why it was needed to begin with.\n\nI don't know, it just seems like this whole restaurant just won't be worth most people's time. Yes, it really is that bad. Yes, you will probably regret it. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that's the way Dan cooks his pizza.",

The cracked bathroom tiles are filled with dirt and mold. Residents are forced to opt-in to a $20/month service for someone to carry one bag of trash from their doorstep to the dumpster a couple of hundred feet away (whether they use it or not).\n\nManagement was sometimes slow to enforce policies, but was genuine and friendly, even offering free parking as an incentive for lease renewals. Now, a new management company is in town. It feels like they've waged war against residents.\n\nThey've started assessing parking fees mid-lease to residents who extended leases under the incentive of free parking. They've sent blanket threatening emails to residents for occasional & minor infractions by only a resident or two. The lease states guests may park on the property up to 7 days per month, but a recent group of guests were ticketed in just a few hours. The ticket stickers were difficult to remove and left permanent residue on the vehicles during hot summer weather. I called Post Ridge to inquire about why vehicles were ticketed and was told guests may park on surrounding streets. With the size of this property, the closest street parking is over half a mile away with no sidewalks along busy Hicks Rd.\n\nThis place has a lot of potential if management can shift their energy from penalizing residents to welcoming them.",

  "text": "Absolutely awful. Poor accounting with room charges, using either inadequate systems at the front desk, or the staff is totally without a clue. My guess is both. Overcharged, duplicate charged, held accounts for days after departure; many of our friends and family for a wedding stay over the weekend and we are reaching out to ask them to check their credit/debit cards. The printed out sheets of your daily charges are not there and the staff could not or would not delve into. In nearly 60 years of travel and 40 of that military, it was so, so disappointing and added stress to our weekend. Took 45 minutes to get breakfast Friday morning, a staff of one, yes I said \"1\". Our room with inadequate temperature control (could not get the room higher than 67 one eve even though we had set for heat and set for 75). TV. Would not work. Had to call the front desk (had to guess the desk number as there are NO  informational books about the hotel and services). They sent up a service guy. Showed me how to unplug the cable in the back of the TV in order to get it to work when we turn it on. I am not kidding. Had to that for 4 days. The bathroom door is a sliding wood door that does not close entirely, NOR, does it lock. You want privacy, forget about it. My daughter and her husband were charged the same charges we paid for on their room previously, minus the room charge. They were charged an extra night of valet too on top of the duplicate charges. They billed the extra valet without telling them and eventually reimbursed without telling them 3 days later. I paid for their valet and restaurant charges when we left a day earlier. They, the front desk staff, did not believe them when they told them and would not check the payment made by me, they basically called them liars. My other son, the groom was overcharged,  it has not been corrected as they are on their honeymoon. The parents of the bride were overcharged $90 per night until exhaustively explaining to the staff at the desk the group rate they had agreed to. I am still waiting for a reimbursement of $179.32 in duplicate charges, I asked the General Manager to call. Crickets so far, guess it's not important to them. Avoid the Cambria,  it is new, but it is awful for service and is NOT ready for business. They need to do a stand down and get it together and get it right. General Manager, still waiting for the call, check with Rachael. Left  a message.  P.S. Horrible location from anywhere. Plus $38.24 for valet per night.  It was $35 until we got there and found it that was taxed as well. Sorry place.",

  "text": "Really bad experience.  My first time visiting Solidcore; I arrived 10 minutes early and no one checked me into class or greeted me as a first timer.  I accidentally showed up to the Rittenhouse location when my reservation was for the Center City location.  100% my mistake, but I had no idea I was at the wrong location until after class started and the instructor kicked me out of class.  We were 3 exercises into the class and the instructor was calling out names for those signed up because a late-arriving student showed up and there were not enough machines.  My name was not called and I realized I was not at the right location.  The instructor yelled at me- through the microphone- to get off the machine immediately(!!).  An embarrassing and frustrating experience.  I think a class that is based on a set # of machines should have check-in before class, and late arriving students shouldn't kick out students when class is already in progress.",

Unfortunately, our most recent visit tops the others. We walked in on a Tuesday at 5pm and there wasn't anyone at the hostess stand. We wanted to sit in the bar area anyway, so we made our way downstairs and sat down. After about ten minuets of not being acknowledged by any of the three or four staff who were either at the bar or behind it, we decided to leave. As we were leaving a young woman said \"bye, thank you!\" And we looked at her and said \"we didn't get served and never got acknowledged.\" She started to grab menus and we said \"no, thanks. We're going somewhere else.\"  and left. Between the overpriced food and terrible service, we won't ever be coming back.",

It took 45 minutes just to get my water (after politely reminding the server 3 times) until I finally walked up to the serving station and began to pour it myself before our server offered to take over.

While the southwestern spices were nice, the tortilla strips were soggy and the soup was very, very salty. The server was accommodating and offered to bring something else, but by the time she came by to check on me, I was halfway done. On a whim, I decided to try the \"new\" Painkiller mini cake. It's supposed to be a coconut cake that has rum rizzled over it, topped by whipped cream, toasted coconut and a cherry. The cake was dry, and the rum flavor overwhelmingly  medicinal. I couldn't eat more than a couple of bites. Now, 20 minutes later, that medicinal taste strongly lingers. I do want to come back and try one of the regular entrees before passing full judgment, but this evening's meal was a real disappointment.",

Only reason I am giving this 2 stars is the waiter was honestly the worst waiter I have ever had. I'm not sure if he was having a bad day but something was going on. Was so quick and not welcoming at all. I have felt more welcomed at 711 then he made us feel. Didn't greet us at first he just asked....want water after he stood there for a few seconds. I'm not sure if they shadow these quarters before putting them on there own but I recommend he be shadowed until he can do his job at a sub par level. If you go there do not get Julian's section. During dinner he disappeared so we called over a waitress cleaning her tables in the next section over. She was so nice and took care of us and was really nice. I think she could tell what we were dealing with since she offered to assist us with anything we needed. Food was ok and we had to send one dish back because it did not taste good.

Disgusting! We went about our day, left the pillow on the bed, hoping that when we came back it would have been changed out (We didn't not sign up for Marriott \"Go Green\". )Got back to room checked the pillows and the one that had the issue was still on the bed, stained side facing the headboard. Annoyed because this is Day 2 of our stay with stained bedding. Of course, I didn't not get an answer from the \"At your service\", instead I have to go downstairs to speak with someone!

I tell her no they are not old and this was my first fill on this set. And no the tech did not ask to replace them, but if she had, I would've declined. I also told her I've been wearing acrylics for 40 years and it's rare that I break a nail. In this situation the nails were too thin and the tips were popping off despite how extra cautious I was. \n\nThe owner refused to offer any solution or even an apology.

  "text": "This is the best place for carne asada.  Whether you want carne asada tacos or burritos a bowl its hands down the best place for carne asada. Last night boyfriend and I decided to try the location in Park Place Mall food court, and it was AMAZING. It was quick, we asked for the carne asada to be well done. Super picky when it comes to well done, don't like it burnt but I don't like chewing on pieces like fat. They took the portion of carne asada and made sure it was well done. Like I mentioned it was BOMB. So carne asada burrito deff recommend! Not only that but at the mall they do serve beer & margaritas coming soon, and you get free chips with order over $5. Definitely will be visiting the Park Place Mall location again soon!\n\n\nUpdate: went back again, this time got the worst customer service ever. Went from a 5 Star to a 1 star. Telling me not to throw employees under the bus. All because I asked for meat to be cooked well done. And he said the meat is already done, I said they cooked it extra for me last time. And then he started off by rudely telling me not to throw employees under the bus. I said I didn't say when I came or who even didn't it. Then he continued to tell me it's not cool to throw employees under the bus because that's just not cool they could get in trouble. In trouble for cooking meat longer? Not only that but there was more customers behind me that we're just starting at him because they saw how rude he was being. I will not be returning here again. So thanks to the short man with a full beard and mustache you loose a customer and gain a negative review.",

After waiting for 10 minutes on my food I called the phone number on the receipt to remind them that I was still waiting.  When I did finally get my food there wasn't even an apology or a thank you for your patience.  I went on corporates website to lodge a complaint and in less than a week I received a response stating that someone from the local franchise would contact me.  After a month I reached out to corporate again stating that I had never received a response.  Finally received a call from local franchise and it reinforces my belief that this franchise doesn't care about customer service.  I will take my business elsewhere and make sure all of my friends and family do the same.",

That being said, we didn't spend much time out there because the traffic was incredibly loud and the birds would attack.\nIf I come here again I would probably stay at the new Wyndham across the street, it's beautiful.

  "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but there was just too much bad for me to rate the place higher than one star and would be very hesitant in ever returning based on my first time experience.  Most likely a one and done for me.\n\nIt all started when I ordered the Sunday Special of 10-Wings & a Pitcher of Beer for $15.99; not a great deal compared to other places, but it was what I wanted.  I ordered my wings extra crispy, naked, with sauce on the side; (I don't like soggy & under cooked wings, as most places have a habit of doing).  Two of the gents I was with, ordered wings as well, one ordered crispy, the other ordered them regular; and we all had different sauces and some with sauce on and some on the side. \n\nWhen our wings arrived, all three types of done-ness came out, but went to the wrong individuals.  My wings came out exactly how I DID NOT want them; they appeared to be light in color, texture and crispness, but seemed cooked enough to eat, and since I was hungry, I mistakenly dug in...Even though they were anything but extra crispy, plus they were smothered in sauce.  I didn't want to sit & wait for a corrected order to eventually come out, as my friends had all started to dig in and I didn't want them waiting on me...Huge mistake!.  \n\nHalfway into the second gooey wing with blood/juice running out, I decided they were not safe to eat without being cooked longer, so instead of making a big deal out of it, I just simply ordered what I thought would be quick half pressed Cuban sandwich for dine-in and then asked for a to-go box for the remaining undercooked wings, so I could finish cooking them at home.   Side Note:  To finish them at home, I ended up baking them at 425-degs for 5-mins on each side, THEN to crisp them up, I had to broil them at 500-degs for 4-mins each side...18-mins of extra cooking, that is how flipping undercooked they were.  I was honestly shocked & disgusted how undercooked & dangerous they were, AND that they would serve them to a customer!!!\n\n15-mins later my dine-in sandwich eventually arrived in a steamed up to-go box with soggy curly fries.  Since my friends were finished with their meals, finishing up their drinks, and asking for their checks, I figured I would at least eat the soggy fries and half of the Cuban while we waited.  When the checks arrived, I noticed my bill was substantial higher than everyone else's, even though I had ordered an additional meal, things were just not adding up.  After looking at all of our checks, I determined I was charged the normal price for wings & beer vs. the Sunday Special I had ordered.  The strange part was, my golf buddy's check was properly rung in depicting the Sunday Special, but Mine was not.  Plus, my check didn't even have the right type of beer I had ordered, so I'm not even sure if I got what I ordered.  My buddy realized I was getting pissed, (which is not like me AT ALL), so he ended up dealing with the bartender to get the check fixed, which allowed me to scarf down some of my reorder so no one had to wait on me.\n\nOnce my \"corrected\" bill was brought out, I decided I would give the bartender the benefit of the doubt and still leave a tip, (but only 18% vs. the 30% I typically tip bartenders/servers).  While signing my credit card slip, I noticed the recommended tip printed on the bill was more than what I had calculated it would have been; which caused me to break out the calculator and compare all of our bills to figure out why my bill was incorrect once again.  As it turned out, everyone else's recommended tip amount was properly calculated on their receipts; however, mine was not.  After further inspection, I discovered instead of ringing in the Sunday Special, as she had correctly done on my buddy's check, the bartender just simply applied an equivalent dollar amount discount; therefore, by doing so, the recommended tip on the receipt was calculated based on the original amount, (before she added a discount vs. ringing the Sunday Special in correctly).  I'm talking about less than a dollar difference, (so what's the big deal right?); however, at this point, it's the principle of the matter and adding insult to injury.  Out of all the ineptness on the restaurant's part and too much niceness on my part,  I'm getting squeezed for what equates to roughly another $0.60...Ain't happening!\n\nComing from the restaurant business and a sports bar at that, I have a VERY high tolerance for mistakes, typically appreciate my bartenders/servers, can tell if they are weeded or just lazy, and maybe all of this very well could have been honest mistakes made along the way of one visit by one customer out of many; (i.e., order coming out wrong, food being undercooked, waiting 15-mins for a reorder, reorder coming out in a to-go box with soggy fries, bill being rang in incorrectly, and the recommended tip printing out higher than it should have been because of being edited incorrectly).  2/3/18 @ 2:13pm / Check 75 / Table 61 / Server: KH",

  "text": "Our primary vet referred us for emergent and specialty care.  Our 1st visit was terrific, Dr. Singleton was knowledgeable and thoughtful with exceptional bedside manner.  Her second visit was a surgeon consult for the same problem.  The surgeon and the oncologist were both excellent.  The clinicians on staff seem to be some of the best around; my rating is due to standard operating procedures and front desk training.  The front office staff, in my opinion, are disorganized and rude.  I'm not sure if it's because of my physical appearance or just the lack of customer service training, manager accountability to behavior expectations or what.  \nSituation:  I called on Thursday for a refill for my fur baby. I was told they needed my primary care to send a script even though it was ordered by their MD and filled by their pharmacy. No problem, I called my vet and asked them to send one over.  Friday... Saturday I called to check status, it was received.  I called my vet again they faxed it over and emailed it.  I called to verify the script was received, it was.  A few hours later, I called to check status. They told me not to call them, they are busy, and they will call me when it's ready.  Sunday... Monday, I called her primary vet again and explained the situation, of course, they were appalled.  They called NorthStar and was told they didn't have a script to fill. My vet faxed the documents again and confirmed receipt, then called to follow up 6 hours later and was also told I would receive a call once it's ready in don't call us, we are busy tone.  My fur baby has now been without the only thing that gives her relief for 3 days, so I go to NorthStar at 8:35 pm to check on the status.  Initially, I was turned away and given the \"we are busy\" phase. I stayed and explained my disappointment, so they said for me to wait, they will fill the prescription but couldn't give me a time frame. Ok... I waited 45 minutes until they told me they were out of the medication and that is the reason I was never called.   But you want my 2,000 for a CT and biopsy?!?!? Nope, we'll find a dependable system that can support their patients past the initial visit.\n\nThe next day, I told my primary vet about the experience she called and they told her the rx had been filled and is ready for pick up?!?!? Really???? \n\nAnyway, I picked it up and front desk is still rude, folks were not apologetic or bothered in the slightest.  I will not spend any more of my money there, going to Banfield and UPenn from now on.",

One guy nail tech was giving a pedicure and looked at me walk in, stand there and wait, and didn't inform anyone. Then the other nail techs looked at me and then waited to ask me what I needed. I said a manicure, and the nail tech that was giving a pedicure to another customer said \"Can you come back in 25-30 mins?\" I said ok, I will come back.(which I already at that point had NO intention of coming back) Then the other girl nail tech said, \" Maybe you can, like, make an appointment next time.\" \n\nThis place is garbage now that it is under new management. The staff is equally as bad. Very unfortunate, because I work in the West Shore business district and would come here on lunch every other week.

We were originally told her symptoms were indicative of marijuana toxicity.  I felt like the vet was so focused on this  diagnosis of marijuana toxicity -  which was NOT the case at all.  \n\nX-Rays and blood work were done and ultimately she was given an injection of prednisone for possible inflammation and sent home... She returned home with the heavy breathing and confusion. I was told to see a neurologist for further examination.  However, no medications were prescribed and $700 later we didn't have any clear answers. It went from possible lesions on the brain to possible valley fever - which she had been tested for by VCA in the past, possible cushings disease, etc. She had very high platelet count and we were also told high cortisol levels but no REAL explanation as to why. I have to say I came home with more questions than answers.   \n\nI really wish that I had been told to get our dog to a higher level of care when she first arrived at your facility and that you weren't equipped for her type of emergency. I would have left immediately and taken her elsewhere where my money would have been spent more WISELY. She is no longer with us.  \n\nIt really feels like this facility bases care on the REVENUE they can bring in.

  "text": "DO NOT STAY.I was absolutely blown away by this terrible hotel.  I have stayed here each  great time I visit (for years!) and it has gone downhill with every stay.  It is now in such disarray that it is now my last visit ever.  \n\nI had a package that included valet parking for one night.  The second night would have been well over $40!  So I had to self park in a garage.  \n\nThe woman at the check in was NASTY and treated me like I was an annoyance with her snippy attitude!  I was so appalled that I almost took my luggage and gone to another hotel.  \n\nThe hallways are dark and dismal as well as beyond dated and worn.  Carpet is disgusting and worn.  The doors are black which just adds to this dismal appearance.  The room entries are all banged up!\n\nRoom:  Dark and dismal.  Once again carpet is very old and worn. Bulb out in the bathroom.  There are no USB ports in the room and I verified that with front desk.  Internet access is not free unless you are an SPG member and it is expensive!\n\nI would recommend that you stay somewhere else unless this doesn't bother you.  \n\nAll in all, two nights here cost me close to $400 and it is actually worth about $100 for both nights.  \n\nCan't wait to get out of here.",

Don't get me wrong they are polite and when you are not happy they listen but they just don't do a good job. They up-sell you option making it sound like you are going to get a clean vehicle but it never happens. When I tell them I am not happy they send someone over to redo it but you shouldn't have to do that every time. I just gave up and drove off. I now drive all the way over to Watson rd to get my vehicles cleaned. It is unfortunate that I have to take that much time out of my day because basic services can't be met.",

  "text": "First I gotta tell you, I used to love eating here and even came in two days in a row while I was in town visiting family. This day I sat at the bar because I was by myself. I come to your establishment because I expect a quality meal in a nice atmosphere, but today I experienced something that I would have never expected of your fine establishment. There was a young woman sitting at the other end of the bar eating and talking rather loudly. She was in a Drago's shirt. It is not like I was trying to ease drop, you couldn't help but hear her, and if I heard her, I am sure other people could hear her to. Now granted it was slow, but what I heard her say made me question if I will ever come back. While the young lady was eating and talking loud she proclaimed that she liked to \"crop dust\" the restaurant while she was working and seating people at their table. She said she liked to do that \"because they would not know where it came from\". She then made a noise like flatulence. And started laughing. Now if you don't know what \"crop dusting\" is, it is a silent fart while walking by some unsuspecting people. I may expect this from a bar on Bourbon Street,  but not in your fine eatery. I thought long and hard if I should let you know about this and thought that a flagrant disrespect for the customers needed to be told.",

Your manager mishandled the situation.  The bottom line you had at least 3 other employees server her in the past. With the same id.  I am not coming back because you didn't server her.

I fell into the fancy wording on Expedia say NEWLY RENOVATED I can see the effort to try and fix up this older hotel but they are falling far short of anything good. For starters it took about 30 min to check in do to only one person working behind the counter, and when I checked in the gave me a room that was already occupied by someone else. So I went back downstairs and they gave me another room the sink had what looked like black makeup smudged all around it, then the shower leaked more water than it sprayed out of the shower head, then the sliding door to the outside deck was broken off of the track and it took some force to get open. After all of that I thought okay nice bed nope back to sleeping on springs. What could be a nice hotel but is falling far short hope they can fix it up right one day.",

  "text": "This is the second time we ordered from this Honeygrow.  The first time the food just ok (lots of  ground pepper).  This time was interesting.  My wife ordered through grub hub at about 8:15 and the ETA was 8:50.  Then around 8:45 she checked and it said 9:13.  Then at 8:53 she checked again and it said 9:30.  We got a 'll title annoyed and she made me call them.  The girl that answered the phone stated that all the grubhub orders had already left the restaurant.  I asked if my order had even come through or if the driver had picked it up.  She said she wasn't sure and would get the manager.  The manager got on the phone and stated that all the grubhub orders were already picked up and there was nothing in the order window.  He said he was very sorry and that there was nothing he could do.  As I was starting to ask him if he could look up to see if our order even came through. He interrupted me and said \"sorry there's nothing more I can do.  Goodbye.\" and then hung up on me.  I was not upset during the first call and was very nice and calm.  There was absolutely no reason for him to have hung up on me.  I called back very upset for getting hung up on before even getting to ask such a simple question and immediately asked to speak to the manager that just hung up on me.  The same manager got on the phone and immediately apologized to me saying that he didn't mean to hang up on me.  He also said that he hung up because he didn't really know what else he could do for me.  When I asked him if he could look up to see if our order ever even came through. He asked for my name.  I had to tell him 3 times the name was Kelly and he said that he's sorry.  He hasn't had any orders come through in at least 25 minutes.  I said that we ordered the food at about 8:15 which was over 25 minutes ago.  He asked me the name again and then said he didn't have the order come through on his screen.  He stated that he only had...named off 2 names...and then said Kelly.  I said to him that that was OUR name and OUR order.  At that point I thought that this might have been some kind of joke and that there was no way this was an actual manager that I was talking to.  I heard some noises and talking in the background.  He didn't seem to know what he was doing or talking about and certainly was not paying attention to what I was asking him.  I heard him say that the food is right there and then he was asking another girl that I could hear in the background if she was there to pick up the food for Kelly.  She said yes and he came back on the phone and told me the driver had just arrived and is leaving with the food now.  When the driver delivered the food, I had asked her if she had just arrived there or if she was waiting around for the food.  She said that she was waiting for the food to get finished.  She said that a female had told her it wasn't ready and would be done shortly.  Then when she asked again the female had told her that it was just getting put together at which point a male that was on the phone with someone else (me) asked if she was there to pick up the food for Kelly.  She said yes.  He got off the phone with the customer (me).  She asked if everything was already in the bag and the manager rudely said yes, paused for a couple seconds, and very rudely said GOODBYE to her and shoved her off (figuratively).  There is no way this manager (whom seemed to be a moron) should be running a store like this.  I know this place just opened up and that things might get a little hectic in a store like this but that is no way to treat customers or grubhub drivers.  On a side note the food was pretty good.  It was much better than last time.  My wife and son think the food is good but we may not order from them again if that's how they treat customers and those are the type of people they hire to manage the store.  I would give service 0/5 stars because it didn't just seem like a little mistake.  It was incompetence.  The food gets a 3-4/5 stars.",

  "text": "We originally wanted to go to El Camino, but with a 105 minute wait we went across the street to check out urban village since there were empty tables. We were seated within 5 minutes. Red flag #1- every other restaurant on second street had a long wait. Why didn't this?\n\nWe waited 15 minutes for water and our server. 8 1/2 months pregnant on a 90 degree day. I wanted water, damnit! Red flag #2.\n\nAfter receiving our water, the server took our drink orders and we waited about 10 minutes. When she returned with our drinks, she ran off before we could order food. Again, 8 1/2 months pregnant and I was hangry and annoyed. We were ready to order and she just ran away.\n\nAfter flagging down 3 other bussers and servers begging for our waitress to come around, she finally came to take our food orders. Our food came in about 20 minutes which was reasonable. The Rita pizza was pretty tasty. Now here's where it really goes to sh1t.\n\nShe never came back to check on us once. It would have been nice for a refill of seltzer, or more water. It would have been nice for a box. We waited 45 minutes, flagged down 5 other bussers/servers, and then finally a busser comes over laughing saying she got locked in the bathroom. She finally comes over to apologize and LEAVES without letting us ask for a box or the check. At this point we were ridiculously annoyed with both her and management. If there was an issue like that, management should have explained the situation and apologized.  We finally received our check and left a 15% tip which was honestly 15% more than she deserved. I worked in the service industry for 6 years as a bartender and server and if I was locked in the bathroom (I get it, sh1t happens) I would have immediately come out, addressed all tables and apologized, and had management assist in handling the situation. I probably would have comped a drink or two as well.\nCompletely unacceptable experience and I am never returning. You pissed off an angry pregnant woman.",

If you like waiting for a very long time to be seated with nowhere to sit or stand and being rushed through your dining experience than this place is for you. I can understand the long wait because the food is good, but I do wish that they took reservations so people could plan their nights without wasting a huge portion from waiting. The thing that I cannot accept is the rushing. When we come out to eat, we are hoping for an enjoyable, relaxing experience, especially after a long work week. We have spent good money at this establishment and always feel like they are trying to push us out of there to seat the next party. Sad. I wish I could say that this only happened to us one time, but we gave them several chances since their pizza was so tasty.

I came in without an appointment my barber not only made me feel uncomfortable because he kept talking shit and yelling at another barber despite them asking him not to.. he then proceeded to antagonize her by filming as he's harassing her saying \"she's not going to have a job here for much longer?\" To top it off he then goes to film me trying to get me to say that she's bothering me...I'm sorry in what universe is this okay? Especially in a work environment? The fact that the owner/s even let someone so rude who has a complete disregard for customer service and coworkers alike is beyond baffling. I don't think I will  be back at this establishment. Don't bother coming here unless you enjoy feeling completely awkward.

  "text": "Hate to be that unlucky person to have had nothing but bad experiences here. The first time, they overcharged me for a full leg, when all I got done was my lower legs. It was my first time so I just thought it was really expensive..I went ahead and paid(and the cashier/receptionist was eating sandwiches at the counter)....when I discovered that it was indeed an overcharge, I called to ask for an adjustment and the front desk receptionist Amanda treated me like I was a thief or a scammer, and was very rude + short with me.  After I finally got that all straightened out, my legs were not even smooth, but stubbly like I shaved two days ago. I was told this can happen and it would be better the next time. Fast forward to the second time, the waxer spent all of 10 or 15 minutes on me, missed several spots to be discovered when I arrived home..and again, my legs felt stubbly and not smooth...after consulting with a friend, apparently this happens when the service is not performed correctly and breaking the hairs off instead of pulling them out.  I came back a third time to return some products that I decided not to use, and apparently only a manager can perform a simple 30$ return? On top of that, was told she is busy and in interviews all day... nevermind there is a PAYING customer who needs help in the front.  I will never go to EWC again,  I don't think anyone should pay to have stubbly legs, make an appointment to do a return, or deal with the rude young woman at the front desk.  Thank you for your time, may you have a better experience than I did.",

The Shanghai style dumplings were terrible. It was just mushy dumplings.\n\nService was downright terrible. The person wheeling the dim sum cart hauled ass within 5 seconds not even trying to get people interested to look at what they're offering. Waiters were good at clearing plates, not good at changing out empty tea pots. You have to wave one over to change out the empty tea pot, and ask for a specific dim sum dish which they weren't offering on the cart, and trying to wave for one waiter to give you the bill.\n\nThe prices aren't bad for dim sum but the service really does need improvement.",

Add to that the fact that one of our cheeseburgers had a moldy bun, and the waitress didn't offer to comp or discount anything. Food was decent at best. Overheard another customer complaining about there being no carbonation in the soda, and that they charged her for extra sauce, but then didn't even fill up the condiment cup.

Ordered the mushroom burger instead which took 25 minutes to receive . . . which was not worth the wait. \n\nFood items:\n\nDynamite Rolls: DO NOT ORDER - they were very stale, crunchy and old. Mushroom Swiss Burger: flavourless and you were able to count the mushrooms (3.5) placed on top of the patty. Fettuccine Alfredo was good along with the Canadian Hunter burger (only thanks to the chipotle sauce). The fries that went with the burgers were OVERLY SALTED and contained a mixture of 3 different types (is this on purpose?) that due to different cooking times left some soggy or tough. Our server Katie was great - we know the food issues are not her fault. Waiting 25 minutes though to get a burger and then receiving it when everyone else is done their meal was disappointing.\n\nTVs are placed awkwardly around the bar which makes for a difficult viewing experience (and the lighting fixtures do not help by adding glare), however the acoustics in the bathroom from the hockey game were excellent.",

What's the purpose of having your restaurant coupon available on-line if you can't use it?

Disappointingly, I was told it was a different broth, and mine came with spaghetti noodles rather than the standard rice noodles that the # 2 did.\n\nOverall, it was okay, but for a much more flavourful experience, you can do better.

The worst was that we were seated at the end of the table on the side he would always serve last. Because of this and because he was flirting with the only single gal at the table, the two of us always ended up getting very small portions of the food which would sometimes be barely anything. My poor fiance, who was the very last person to be served every time, would get single pieces of chopped meat and veggies and I would maybe get two pieces.

  "text": "Good service but horrible food. Jack's new food truck series has to be the worst sandwiches I have ever eaten from Jack in the box. Taste OK but for $5 a sandwich, better load it up. I've tried two out of the three and it's horrible. The pork \"belly\" in the BLT is so thin, they should be illegal to classify it as belly. Thick bacon is a better term and two pieces that can't fill the sandwich is a rip off. Then the Primerib Steak sandwich didn't even fill 3/4 of the sandwich. Once again failure. Last but not least... They called the bread a baguette but it's really just cheap sub bread. Overall, I'd be ashamed to even market these sandwich as such. I don't blame Martha for not trying them. #JackvsMartha",

  "text": "So there I was just before 6am Sunday waiting in a long line that took over 10 minutes to get to the register (For high priced airport refreshment). \n\nBased on the family reputation and awesome Churros at the Columbia restaurant I was really happy to see them on their signboard. \n\nAlso I saw Cafe Con Leche and a Signature drink with exactly the same description but one additional ingredient. Oddly the CCL was over $5 but the other with more ingredients was under $5. I asked the cashier and she could not explain except \"that's the way they made the sign\"\n\nI declined the coffee since it was a bit overpriced either way. But ordered the churros! Then the cashier told me those are not available until the afternoon. ??? It did NOT say that on the sign board!I pointed out that I waited in line over 10 minutes because of that. \n\nTruly a waste of my time. Poor information, slow service. Largely disappointed. Lesson learned. Lots of other good places get my future business. The Greek place has a dense muffin, glad I tried it.",

The big kid room wasn't open today, and the room was way too young for the 11 year olds I brought. My 5 year old enjoyed himself though. The 11 year olds did enjoy the board games they found. We had cheese nachos with cheese half melted (seemed like they were microwaved), Kraft Mac n cheese (reheated in a microwave?) And waffles (again, reheated in a microwave?). The latte was very average. \n\nGreat concept! But have a lot of opportunity to make better food.",

  "text": "I'm still kicking myself for paying for this breakfast. This was by far the worst food-- and service-- I received while visiting Nola for the week. Four stars on yelp? I just can't..\n\nPros: the cafe itself is the cutest place I've seen in a really long time. With its adorable two person tables, paint colors, tile work, and fireplace in the corner, it's stepping inside from a busy, exhausted city life to a scene straight out of Midnight In Paris. My latte was perfectly adequate-- nothing too fancy and nothing to complain about. \n\nCons: the service. Im sure the night after Halloween is especially rough for both the service industry employees and their patrons, however it was two in the afternoon and there was only one other couple having breakfast so I believe the service should have been far greater. Firstly, our server didn't greet us-- she just sort of glared, waiting for us to announce our intentions-- dining in or getting coffee etc. No smile throughout the duration of our meal. We had to ask repeatedly for refills of water (their water glasses are small). After ordering two crepes for myself and my companion ordering one for himself and a salmon bagel, our food came out. I had no idea each order comes with two crepes-- something our server could have mentioned. When the food came out, which took a lengthy amount of time, the salmon for the bagel was missing and the other items were on the side so it turned out to be a build-your-one bagel kind of thing-- expensive and time consuming. \n\nThe food. I ordered the Nutella/banana crepe and added strawberries and the chicken crepe. Companion ordered the chicken crepe and salmon bagel. He said once he received the salmon and built the bagel, it was tasty. The crepes-- which are why we were so excited to be there-- were terrible. The pancake was like rubber, chewy and enormous, just flopping around everywhere. It was hardly edible. The interior of the crepe was literally just a glob of ingredients in the middle of the cake and wrapped up, leaving a tremendous amount of unused, wasted crepe. The chicken tasted like it was from the can as did the strawberries. Too much Nutella blobbed in the middle to try to mask to underwhelm of the meal. \n\nThe end cost? Over $60 for the worst breakfast I've had in years. Don't waste your time or money unless you're only going for coffee.",

  "text": "I hate to disparage any business, especially one where I've had a good time, but their management really blew it on this one. On Friday I booked a party of 18 for Saturday and paid ahead of time in full ($755). Unfortunately one of our party got sick and had to bail, so when we arrived I asked the front desk if I could be refunded his $42. \"That's fine, we'll take care of that,\" the staff member said. Ok, great, thanks.\n\nAs of today (Monday) I didn't see a refund on my account, so I politely called to follow up and was completely stonewalled by two different managers. The staff member must've been misinformed, they said, and when I (still politely) protested they recited the company lines of \"Well as it says on your email receipt, we need 24 hours notice\" (impossible since I'd booked 24 hours prior), and then \"Once it's in the computer nothing can be done.\" Uh huh. What a weak, dumb way to handle a large group that tipped well and would've happily gone back regularly. Never had this problem at Urban Axes, so we'll take our business there instead.",

  "text": "So to start out on a positive note...my fiance got my engagement ring from here and it is absolutely gorgeous... He ordered online and it shipped very quickly. I couldn't be happier with it. However , when it came time to look for wedding bands we decided it just made sense to go back to Shane Co. Unfortunately the experience was not a good one... The gentleman that offered to help us when we walked in the door seemed almost annoyed that he had to help someone.. but I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he was nearing the end of his shift and just tired. However , we told him we were there to look for wedding bands and I was very excited. He didn't share the excitement ... Didn't ask when the big day was, no interest in us personally . I told him I wanted something Rose gold to match my ring and he started pulling some rings. I noticed the ones he was pulling were much more than we were hoping to spend, so I politely asked him if maybe we could look at something more in the $500-$600 range. I didn't think that was unreasonable based on some styles I had seen online during my research. He immediately said, \"well I can tell you that you aren't going to get a ring with any sort of stone in it in that price range...\"... Okay... So I ended up finding something at the top of that price range that had some small diamonds in it and felt like that was really my only option if I didn't want a plain metal band. He made it obvious he was tired of showing me rings and I felt like I needed to make a decision so next thing I knew I had purchased this ring that I probably wouldn't have originally even picked out. So fast forward a month or so and it was still bothering me that I wasn't completely happy with my ring and felt liked I had been rushed into a decision. So I decided to look elsewhere.  I ended up going to Jared Galleria of Jewelry, and what a stark difference from my experience at Shane. I was greeted immediately by a very bubbly kind woman who was more than happy to show me several options of rings in my price range that were gorgeous. She took her time with me and I felt like she would have spent however long I needed to find the perfect ring . I found a ring I really loved there and was set to buy it but I wanted to give Shane co. one last chance. I went in as soon as they opened today and was greeted by a young woman. I explained to her that I wanted to return a ring I had purchased because I really wasn't sure I liked it but that I was interested in looking at a couple of rings I had seen online. She asked me why I didn't like my ring and I just was honest and explained the prior situation and how I felt rushed into buying something that I wasn't crazy about. She didn't give an apology but jumped at the chance to show me more rings. She looked at my receipt from the original ring and said \"okay I see what your budget is based on this\". She then pulled out a ring and showed it to me. I tried it on and it was really pretty so I took a picture and said I wanted to show my fiance and discuss with him before making the purchase. However I then looked at the price tag and the ring was $1695! Wayyyyyy out of my budget. : ( Plus the ring looked very similar to the one I had found at Jared , but was nearly 3X the cost! I was polite and just told her I think I would just return my other ring today and think about the other ring purchase after discussing with my fiance. She then seemed irritated and lead me to the back to get my refund. Before she left me she said \"sorry about that !\" And then walked off. When I left the store after my return she did not acknowledge me at all... I was very shocked and displeased with both of my experiences ... Especially after hearing all of the commercials that boast about the excellent customer service and great prices from \"cutting out the middle man\". I will be returning to have my engagement ring checked regularly so I don't void my warranty but I don't think I would want to go through the process of looking for jewelry there in the future...",

Dog Etiquette 101: NEVER approach a dog abruptly over the head without getting on her level and letting her sniff first. naturally, my pup yelped and jumped into the corner. Martika immediately said she wouldn't allow her to be groomed because she was too scared. Isn't it part of your JOB to be patient and calm my pup down?! Macaroni has been groomed dozens of times with no issues until Martika got involved. I highly recommend going elsewhere. Our dogs deserve love, attention and most importantly patience. macaroni is a little scared, but never aggressive and just needed some patience and kindness. instead she was refused service and treated like a rat.

On this occasion he did neither and wrote on the Report 'sprayed perimeter...' because no one answered. The tenant was actually outside the porch and no one had come; I didn't receive a call either!\nb) so I called the Office and they offered to reschedule. I requested the 1st appt, which they gave.

When people lie, they should be a little smarter: I was later told \"after his first appt, his truck died ... he's trying to get it fixed and he'll come as soon as that is done!\"  The lie? Mine was the 1st appt!\nThere are other honorable outfits who do a better job, are people of integrity, and do not scam like this Branch does.",

Today marks my third time back within a week and I am as disappointed with my food as I was the last two times. I come for breakfast early hours around 7:30.  So assuming it should be fresh. Today I came on a Monday hoping I wouldn't run into the same problem... wrong. The food I purchased is not coming out hot, and it's definitely not fresh. They're over preparing way too much for the biscuits to taste old and soft, my chicken is barley warm and for the hash browns to taste and even look as if they've sat in a heat lamp for too long.    Myself and family visit chick fil a multiple times a week but unfortunately this one needs to step up the quality of preparation because it's not worth the money you pay for \"fresh\" food.",

I needed to store my belongings with them for two weeks which was supposed to be an additional 400 dollars. Two weeks later after my stuff was delivered, I was given an additional 1800 dollar bill. I was then told the 1800 dollar quote was per load and unload of the truck. Essentially they charged me for an additional move because of the two weeks my belongings were in storage. This was never explained to me prior. I was charged for two full price moves. Completely taken by surprise. Total RIP OFF!! The movers themselves were cool, but this company really screwed me.

It's not dominoes, just need to be mindful of that. My biggest issue is when you want to pick up. My husband had to run some errands so he called to order then made a few stops and was at penny's 40 minutes later. He paid for the pizza and continued to wait. Well over an hour later he's still waiting. There are 6 other people there waiting for orders they called in that should be ready by now. I know this because my husband is texting me the play-by-play while he waits. \nThis is not the first time this has happened to him. They keep the pizzas for delivery cranking out but don't make pizzas for those who are standing in the shop! Penny's is worried about their delivery ratings for apps like Eat24 but have no consideration for the people who have paid who are standing in front of them.\nPenny's, get it together.

We couldn't tell if the clams were actually clams or oysters, and those were probably to blame for how sick he got. \n\nThe service was good to start. Our waitress was very friendly.

I frankly found it unprofessional for a manager to care more about a football game than her job, especially when one server is very obviously swamped.

  "text": "tl;dr: Sandy legitimately tried her hardest to make it right. I mean, like, she plead with me like your drunk boyfriend you're trying to leave. Her heart was in it, people. But somehow, just like your drunk boyfriend, she made it worse.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my experience and yours may be completely different. \n\nWithout further ado: \n\nI am writing this with a heavy heart. I don't want to be the person writing this review about someone's business. I have friends who are small business owners. I understand how grave this is. I even talked it over with some of those friends before proceeding. \n\nThe thing is If I think \"Someone should do something\" and no one is doing anything, then I have a responsibility to be that person. And someone should do something so that you don't end up with crappy aesthetic results or complications that arise from receiving Botox injections from someone who lacks the knowledge, experience and skill required. So here I am.  \n\nThis is an update of what happened after I posted by initial review. \n\nAfter additional interactions with staff of Revenge MD, I decided to accept their refund because while it won't make my face look any better, maybe spending that money on a spa day will help slough all the icky feelings of this experience:\n\nAfter receiving the offer of a refund on Wednesday December 5th and declining it on Thursday, I received a voicemail message from Sandy in business development. She said she was accustomed to everyone loving what they do, that she doesn't like people not being happy with their work, that it kind of hurts, that she did not feel good about taking my money. She said one way or the other, she would like to refund my money. Friday, I returned her call and left a message. \n\nI got no response. So I sent a text because I know everyone receives those. \n\nAt this point, I'm imagining that what will happen is I will be treated with kindness and dignity. I will receive an actual apology and an acknowledgement of my complaint.\n\nThat is not what happened, people. Not at all. Sandy called me back almost immediately exasperated, explaining she'd had a family emergency.  She seemed quite upset, which I understand. She again told me how much everyone likes their service. She gave me bizarre explanations for the other negative Yelp reviews that I did not even mention. No actual apology, just a weird diatribe about how everyone else likes them. She asked me to update my review to include that she has tried to make it right. Then she offered other services, despite the fact that I'd already said I wasn't comfortable with their office treating me any further. I repeatedly told her no, reiterating I wasn't comfortable with her office providing any more services. She kept insisting, repeating my name in every single sentence, like we were old pals. I asked her to respect my answer. She continued insisting. Finally, I went full bore, telling her that as a woman, I'm not sure why she didn't understand the concept that it's my body and my answer is no. I actually said to her, \"No means no.\"I told her if she did this one more time, I would most certainly update my review to include this fact. And since you're reading this, you can guess: She continued. \n\nIn fact, so did other staff when I went to pick up the refund.   The injector I saw came out and handed me an envelope with a check. She again asked repeatedly to provide other services or a touch up. I repeated my consent speech. She ignored me, asked what she could do to make it right. She wanted to smooth things over with me. She wanted me to do something about my Yelp review. I finally disentangled myself. But I felt awful.\n\nEven after openly telling the injector that all I wanted was to be acknowledged, to receive an actual apology, she repeated the gaslighting rhetoric about how she thought my eyes looked better. Personally, I liked my face better when you could see my lower eyelid. Half the reason I get botox is for the lift. It was maddening. \n\nSeriously. It felt exactly like arguing with a drunk boyfriend. I just wanted it to end, you know? I don't want to sit here and admit I wanted cheaper Botox. I don't want to admit I got bad Botox as a result. I don't want to admit that you can't see my lower eyelid anymore. I don't want to admit how wildly insecure I feel as a result of that. All I wanted to do was get the fuck out of this situation and never talk to these people again. I didn't even want to write this. I wanted to forget it and move on. But you know what I want more? For you not to end up this unhappy just because I didn't feel comfortable speaking up. I hope you find it helpful.",

Screaming at a customer though the parking lot to go somewhere else, as opposed to just simply letting them know when they come through the drive thru that you're out of chicken but have plenty of other things to offer on the menu. Also, as a fast food chicken restaurant running out of chicken seems a bit odd. Finally, if the employees are going to sit in the parking lot 4 hours before the store closes to tell people to go elsewhere since you're out of chicken, just close the store for the night. \nNew to this area and really disappointed in my experience tonight.",

  "text": "There is a lot of potential at Pearl Diver. The interior is gorgeous and well-themed and the outdoor space makes you feel that you are transported to an island. Plus I love the cabanas and the overall vibe is really cool and interesting. \nHowever, there were some pretty significant issues. First, you have to order at the bar or window connected to the outdoor space. I definitely had more luck at the bar, but just come here planning to wait to order. That alone isn't a dealbreaker though. I'm fine to wait if I'm getting some interesting drinks and delicious food. Unfortunately Pearl Diver didn't deliver there either. While the port to port cocktail was delicious, it only tasted like fruit juice and was very weak. If I'm paying $12 I want it to taste like an adult beverage. I tried the Paloma later and it was better but also very weak and mostly ice. I was excited about the food but bummed when the mushroom and shishito peppers came out with a laughable amount. There were seriously 5 of them on a skewer and the mushrooms were a huge let down and not worth $9 for these items. Luckily the dumplings and dipping sauce were good so it wasn't a total waste. \nAt the end of our night we enjoyed talking to the bartender and sampled a shot of the daiquiri which was delicious and what I should have ordered instead of the other fruit heavy beverages I sampled. The bottom line is that I paid $50 leaving hungry and completely sober which makes me grumpy. Luckily I was hanging out with an awesome group of ladies so it wasn't a total loss but I'm not rushing back, especially since it's the new place to be and super popular. Maybe they know something I don't?",

For some crazy reason, he charged us an additional $80.00 on our chef's choice menu ( party of 4) because one guest requested \"no scallops\". The owner removed the charge, but it was embarrassing to have to argue over something so ridiculous. It's a shame because the food was very good, but there are so many opportunities to dine where you feel you are appreciated.",

I had a high expectation of this restaurant after one of my friends told me it was the best India food that he has eaten in Philly.\n\nThe offer a buffet as most the Indian restaurant I have been before, they also have a selection of India dishes, for me, I went for the garlic naan and went I order it, the server gives me some attitude I don't know why... and India shrimp biryani medium. \nFor my surprise the biryani was not at all good and not spicy, I normally order my Indian food Medium because I like to feel it a bit spicy on it. But this one didn't have any spicy, the shrimp was not that much and rice dint had any taste at all. \n\n My friends had some food from the buffet that with the look, was better, but I cannot confirm or deny this because I didn't eat it.",

  "text": "I am so sad that I have to write a negative review on Salon L.  I came here for the first time several months ago, after moving to the area from Fishtown.  I saw Mandi.  She was wonderful.  She gave me a great haircut and I couldn't wait to come back.  I scheduled an appointment over a week in advance for 9/24 with Lauren because Mandi was not in on that Monday.  I rearranged my work schedule to accommodate this haircut.  I wanted something \"new\" so I explained to the receptionist what I needed done.  She was confident Lauren could do it.  I received a call at 11am on the date of the appointment that Lauren was sick and could not come in.  Things happen so I rescheduled for Friday 9/28 with Mandi.  Again, I rearranged my day to accommodate the appointment.  My appointment was at 10am.  I received a call at 9am on the date of the appointment that Mandi had a migraine and would not be coming in and that they couldn't accommodate me until 10/11!!!!!!!  WHAT?  2 weeks later.  I was willing to see someone who could do a good cut for my hair type and provided evening and day time availability.  I had explained to the receptionist what had happened with both appointments and she simply said - \"Oh sorry, we just don't have anything.\" Needless to say, I was so excited when I thought I found a salon near my home that was quality and gorgeous.  Sadly, despite being unable to control something like an illness, this has left a very bad taste in my mouth and I cannot continue to rearrange my schedule to then have it disrupted.  I now have to find a new salon.",

Upstairs, the huge screen playing classic music videos also set a retro feel that matched well with the classic 60's era building. \n\nThe service was great. Very friendly, engaging, and helpful. I would give five stars for the space and the service staff.\n\nUnfortunately, the food, on our visit, didn't live up to the promise. \n\nThe biscuits and corn bread that came out first were one of the best parts of the meal. I heard from my table mates that the cocktails were also spot on. \n\nThe appetizer were of marginal quality. Pickled shrimp were fine, but the first plate came out without the piri piri sauce, and the next plate did have it. Taste was good, but presentation inconsistent. \n\nThe lamb meatballs were inedible in my opinion. To me, they were clearly underdone in the center, and the flavor was unpleasant.\n\nThe entrees suffered form the same inconsistency. The gumbo was inedible due to a pronounced burned flavor...it has been on a low burner too long between stirrings and had scorched.\n\nThe salmon was a good portion and cooked well but with mediocre flavor. The succotash it rested on was scant and no lima beans were to be found. \n\nThe Blue Ribbon salads were topped with over fried plantain strips, measly portions of chicken, but otherwise not bad. Not great, but not bad.\n\nThe short ribs my table mate had were also lackluster. He said \"It was basically pot roast\". Not bad, not great. Consider the price tag of the entrees is significant.\n\nSo the kitchen was having a rough night when we were there. They were out of the vegetarian special and also the chicken breast. How does a restaurant run out of chicken breast?\n\nAnyway, cool vibe, not very good food.",

They would not refund nor exchange. They just said it had air in it.  So once again, a month later on Oct 24th I took the same lighter back and told them I would like an exchange as this had been the THIRD time I had received a defective lighter from them.  The owner proceed to call me a b---h, accuse me of ripping him off, taunted every remark I made, and told me to get out.  He then  followed me out of the store accusing me of using the lighter for crack and meth an told me I was a bad customer. I told him I would never shop at his store again, as well as tell everyone I knew not to shop at his store, and that this was the worse example of customer service I have ever saw. He continued to make remarks and as I was walking away from the store.  I called the police and the better business bureau as he accosted me verbally, slandered me, misrepresents and does not stand behind his products.

  "text": "Absolute nightmare to deal with - DO NOT USE!\n\nNegative 5 stars. I was covered for 6 months while living abroad. I started to experience inexplicable back pain and contacted them to see if chiropractic visits could be submitted for reimbursement. They said yes and provided no other details. So I saw a chiropractor twice for $150, which resolved the problem, and submitted my claims by March 8, 2018. It is now June 28, 2018 and I had yet to hear a word from them despite sending follow up emails asking for confirmation that they'd received my claims. So I called just now and they said they were processed yesterday. YESTERDAY. They have no explanation of why it was processed months after submission and weeks after my coverage ran out. They are now saying I would have needed proof of a prescription for the chiropractor from a GP for them to reimburse. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO KNOWN THAT WHEN I FIRST ASKED. It's far, far too late now to do anything about my claim but I wasted a ton of money on my coverage and sought out care I couldn't afford because they assured me I would be eligible for reimbursement. There is nowhere on the paperwork I have that states I needed a prescription prior to my consultation to be eligible for reimbursement. Could not be less pleased with how any of it was handled or the customer service. Zero communication, extremely late in processing claims, secret clauses that aren't made known to the customer until the claim is denied. Complete waste of money, effort, and time. NEVER USE IMG! DO NOT TRUST! Practically a scam.",

The fries taste like old fries thrown back in the hot oil and warmed and we all know how reheated fries taste! My grand daughter had the build your own burger and all she wanted was bacon bacon and bacon. Well it came with two slices of bacon. Yep that's it. The waiter did go get her more bacon. He also got her more fries that were supposed to get fresh but the came out in a minute and taste the same as the first batch. I guess we are finally done with this place!",

  "text": "Wow, Surf Shacks really slipping. Have been there a few times over the years and it's just steadily got worse. Tried their taco Thursday and while the price was great, you do in fact get what you pay for. Ordered three tacos, and could only get through half of one. Meat not fully cooked, chicken not fully cooked, and fish looked as if it was fried in the same oil as onion rings. I should have sent it back but i was pressed for time and chalked it up to a cheap loss. Some times you just got to write it off. You can feel the slow march of steady decline. Maybe time for a refresh, reboot, and new idea for this location. Better yet, bring in a Rubios!",

We were seated upfront, as usual, and then nothing happened...for 15 minutes. My husband finally got up to track anyone down who appeared to work there, then we waited again. The hostess finally came and tossed some waters on the table and we ordered drinks, and were promptly told they no longer have a bartender and only serve soft drinks, beer and wine, huh. When our number came up, we were finally allowed to order, all food from soup, appetizer and entrees came out within 30 seconds of one another. The food was still pretty good, but twice the veggies and half the meat, major money saving tactics have obviously put into practice here. What a shame. Now Jazmine has the feel of just another cheap Asian food restaurant.",

The queso started out sooooo good but we threw half of it away when we got to the entire bottom that was burnt onto the pan.

  "text": "Impressed by the reviews, I stopped here for lunch about 1:00 pm on a Thursday.\nThe room was still full (lunch crowd) and very noisy. It seems recent restaurant/bar owners have not gotten the concept that patrons may like to communicate verbally rather than text.\n\nI elected to sit at the bar. The service, initially, was quite prompt. Chips & Salsa arrived immediately. The bartender took my request for a specifically made Margarita. She made that quickly and to my request. However, she did not inquire as to what size I wanted or if \"on the rocks\" or \"with salt\". But I instructed her on that.\n\nShe quickly took my food order (burrito deluxe, flour tortilla with shredded\nbeef topped with lettuce, tomatoes sour cream and shredded cheese and served with rice and beans).\n\nThe food arrived VERY quickly and I ordered a second Margarita, specifying the size. Also arrived quickly.\nBoth the food and the Margaritas were exceptional.\n\nUpon completion of my lunch, I moved the plate aside for clean up. I noticed that the other bar patrons' plates had not been cleared. Unusually, but do to the hour, I wasn't concerned.\n\nI looked for the bartender, who was not to be found. There were 2 employees at the far end of the bar chatting, but seemed unconcerned with my needs. Completing my drink, I used the bath room and returned to my seat. Still no bartender.\n\nI left what I considered sufficient payment in cash and walk out. No one seemed concerned. On my way out, I noticed who I thought was my bartender, sitting in a booth chatting with 2 other ladies. Really?!!\n\nI would NOT patronize this restaurant again and certainly WILL NOT recommend it.",

You could always say excuse me\" the man then started to yell in my face commanding that I \"don't talk back to him\" and \"Stay in a lady's place\"  I let him know that my sex had nothing to do with his manners and moved out of the way to wait for my coworkers order. The man came and stood right next to us and continued to belittle us in front of the entire deli. I didn't intend to keep entertaining his ridiculous behavior but he couldn't seem to get over the fact that an \"Excuse me\" would have sufficed.  The owner, instead of asking what was happening started yelling \"Spread love\" and seemed to side with the man who had instigated this entire ordeal.  After I had the opportunity to explain what had happened the owner offered to buy me a meal which I respectfully declined.\n\nBe kind to each other people don't act like misogynistic asshole simply because your mother never taught you to say \"EXCUSE ME\" \n\n\nNeedless to say- I will not be returning to this deli.",

My sister had been here twice before and although she had not had a stellar experience, she wanted all of us girls to do something special.\nThis was not to be.\nWhen we walked into a lovely but empty dining room around lunch time, we were introduced to the delicious looking menu and lovely tea cups... and this is where we should have left.\nBest part: A delicious cup of tea \nWorst Parts: Tea sandwiches that were all bread, no filling, bland soup, skimpy salad, tasteless dressing, strange tasting desserts and lack of \"tea bread\" that was supposed to be included, yet didn't make it to the table.\nAll of this could have been mostly overlooked if the service had been more accommodating and friendly.\nFrom the get go, it felt uncomfortable. When we asked to take home our lemon curd, jam and clotted cream, we were told we could not because ( of a BS excuse that was not clear to us). Instead we would have preferred to make that judgement call. Finally, when I had slipped away to pay the bill, I wanted to be discreet about doing so and the staff could not, would not assist with my simple request. All I wanted to do was give her my card and sign it out of view of the dining room, however, this seemed to be much too much for the waitress.\nI have never left a review before, today was mandatory.\nSadly Disappointed.",

The meat was a cheap cut, tough and I could barely cut through it with a steak knife, it was also overcooked. It had no flavor until I dipped it into the au jus which was great.  Not sure if it was an off night or they are cheaping out and buying low grade meat.  The service is excellent though.  For the price I expected better.  I will give them one more chance but I will be ordering something different.",

The atmosphere was enjoyable, good music, and we had the sweetest server that was very attentive, that being said the food took longer than I would have expected as it was not very busy. I had the Nashville Hot Chicken and Biscuit with fries. The biscuits were nothing special and the chicken was not very hot (spicy) but it appeared to be made with dark meat and it seemed like every bite had one of those tendons in it that made it hard to eat, I couldn't even finish it. My daughter had the Redneck Nachos, they were just okay, not near enough toppings for the amount of chips they give you. Ole Red does not appear to be a traditional Honky Tonk so I would have expected more out of it as a Restaurant - more to choose from and better quality for the price. I probably will not return.",

  "text": "I never wanted to give a 1 star review on this site (my family runs a small business and I know firsthand that they're not fun) but it feels wrong not to put in a word for folks considering giving this place a try. \n\nMy partner made reservations for Passover dinner, calling ahead of time to make sure they could accommodate a vegetarian. Person on the phone says \"sure, you can order the vegetarian options off the regular menu.\" We come in, tell the waitress that we had a reservation for two. She stares at us for a second and abruptly tells us \"no\", and there was a moment where we all stood around awkwardly, kind of taken aback by her attitude. She probably realizes this and quickly adds \"oh but don't worry, I gotcha!\" (Apparently our name was on the bottom of the list and a little faded? The whole tone of the exchange was surreal.) \n\nAs we were seated, my partner wanted to doublecheck about her options as a vegetarian. Waitress tells her no, the person she spoke to on the phone was wrong, she can only get the vegetable platter, before heading off. At this point we're thinking maybe we should go somewhere else for Passover and hope for the best, at which point the waitress becomes suddenly extremely attentive, slapping down a bowl of pickles and matzo and asking for our drink orders. Neither of us are particularly confrontational, and we both hate wasting food, though I realize this is the point where we should've walked out and not looked back. It just seems kind of sleazy to try and corner/pressure people into staying at the first sign of reluctance, though ultimately it's on us for sticking around. \n\nThe matzo ball soup was pretty good, but everything else was about dinner... disappointing, to put it mildly. (Especially the weirdly mushy short rib -- I was kicking myself for taking my chances on it.) I didn't bother with my leftovers. Partner got to pick at a plate of bland steamed vegetables while we stewed in regret. The cookies and baked goods they gave us at the end were technically the best part of the night, except for the part where my partner almost choked on a toothpick in her brownie. \n\nI've been going back and forth on writing about this experience for a few weeks now because like I said, I hate the idea of leaving 1-star reviews as a matter of principle, but this was a uniquely terrible experience. We both seriously regret giving the place a chance.",

We had to ask another customer if we are to seat ourselves. Then after sitting at the table for 10mins. A guy at the bar table signals for the brunette waitress to come to our table. She comes over, no apology, no smiles and unfriendly demeanor. After we've ordered, it took a long while before getting our pizza. Also we were presented with dirty plates. Again no apology from the waitress. When I went up to pay the bill. I presented the mobile coupon, the careless waitress redeemed both coupons! Exceeding our bill total. Since our experience was bad, I didn't want to return. I decided to used the other coupon that they've said they'll honor on my next visit. Well guess what! The young man who took my order for the pizza to go, said it'll just be a little bit for my order to be ready. So my kids and I sat down to wait. 15 mins later another person comes up and asked what was our order. Because the person before didn't put in the order correctly! At this point I was near tears from this horrible experience. No, we will never return!",

When asked if we could have a booth she begins to tell me they can't put highchairs at a booth. The way she said it was rude. Once seated our waitress, Destiny came over right away...she took 15mins to bring our drinks out..nothing difficult (tea, pepsi, lemonade) we also order wings as an appetizer. After finally bringing our drinks out the wings were still not out. We ordered our meals and after about 30 mins we got our meals and the wings came out at the same time! We ate, food ok. Wings were dry not enough sauce. Waitress never came to check on us. She disappeared and no where in sight for 20mins! Then She walked past us 4-5 times not once looking at us, asking if we needed anythung or how anything was. Never brought refills either. We cleaned up table and sat waiting and waiting..finally after 15 mins she comes and we ask for checks. We pay. She never told us to have a good day or thank you or anything she just put checks on table and walked away. Really??? HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! Not to mention when we were leaving the manager who was on duty was too busy setting up a display table to even ask us how anythimg was and did not even thank us for coming..never said a damn word!

Unfortunately the vocal were so obnoxiously loud I couldn't hear my buddy who was sitting next to me at the bar without screaming or invading personal space. The bartender was pleasant and tentative to her customers at the bar. Greeted us pretty much as soon as we sat down. She had to lean over the  bar to take our order due to the people doing karaoke being so loud which made it hard to have a personable experience. I asked her why it was so loud she also complained and agreed with me about it being overwhelming. I assumed she would possibly speak with the host of the karaoke but nothing changed so we left after one beer with a headache and an empty stomach. Were planning on staying out awhile but I guess on the positive side i did save money the bar would most definitely had gotten with just very little effort.",

The wait for a table is absolutely ridiculous, ended up having to hangout in the hallways of the building connecting because this place is so overcrowded.  They don't take reservations (which is ridiculous to start with and could ease up on the congestion) and their rules on half of your party being there BEFORE you put your name on the 2 hour long wait list is beyond the worst.\n\nFood-cold and bland.

Nobody else was sick.\n\nBetween the rude hostess, the wait, the food, and the experience I'm officially done.",

I hate to give them a low score just at the open but this is just what I think.\n\nThis review is for the center city location. I came in with high expectations but did not like the food at all. I got the tonkotsu ramen. Presentation was poor, and the ramen came in a plain white paper bowl kind of like an instant ramen bowl. There was no water - they gave a tiny water bottle and disposable utensils. The veggies did not look too crispy or fresh but quite limp and pale.\n\nThe broth was very thin and not silky. It was bland and not salty or savory enough. The pork was not cooked in a pot roast style but instead fired with a torch, which gave am unusual burnt and chewy texture rather than something soft and buttery like normal tonkotsu pork dishes. The noodles were no better. They were a little too chewy.\n\nOverall the ingredients were poorly integrated and bland. Try nom nom ramen a few blocks away or terakawa for better ramen.",

  "text": "*Minor Update -- I filled out a survey from Landrys corporate expressing my concerns and have received ZERO response. \n\nThe thing saving this review from the dreaded, but not often awarded, \"1 star\" was that the food was very good.  That being said...\n\nWe showed up on a Saturday night.  The place was more than half empty, but there was a wait due to short staffing...  Well, o.k.  We were lucky to be seated pretty quickly and ordered because we were hungry.  \n\nWe waited 90 minutes for our entrees.  The tables around us that were seated after us were all eating, or done eating.  When we finally got a manager--after about 70 minutes--he said he would check and then we never saw him again until the food came.  I'm assuming our order was lost and not actually put in until we inquired after more than an hour.  Some kind of update would have been nice rather than leaving us hanging.\n\nThis stuff happens.  I get it.  I didn't care for the manager's approach. He apologized for the delay and for our \"short wait\" while making a bunch of excuses about being busy and short staffed.  As we continued to stare at him blankly he offered to comp our dinner salads...  Which seemed like the very, very least he could do.  I mean really, the very least.  He actually called 90 minutes a \"short wait\" several times.  You can keep saying it -- but that doesn't make it true.  And it makes us feel like you are downplaying the problem rather than owning it.\n\nI hate hearing excuses.  Especially when the problem is of your own making anyway.  Why can't a manager just admit that the service was unacceptable and not the way we intend to treat customers?  Maybe a decent discount or even some coupon for a free entrée if we come back (to get us to come back).  The whole reaction to a pretty big screw-up was -- \"sorry about your short wait.\"  It's not enough to make me want to go back, even though the food was all very good.  Food is good in lots of places, you know?\n\nLife is like a box of chocolates.  You never know what you are going to get.  But at a restaurant that's about $30-$50 per person, you do expect to actually get your dinner in a timely fashion.",

  "text": "***Review for Rooftop Bar Movie Night Only***\n\nI am a NOLA local and saw they were playing The Ring at Catahoula Hotel Rooftop. My cousin is in town and, oddly enough, had never seen the movie so we decided to give it a try in spirit of Halloween. \n\nLet me preface by saying the rooftop bar was very inviting, atmosphere was great and it had a very cool laid back vibe. The bartender was extremely friendly, we ordered a refreshing bottle of white wine to enjoy with the movie. She also informed us they do movies up there every Wednesday, how cool! \n\nSomething was wrong with the sound of the movie on the digital copy or the wiring of the speakers and the entire movie skipped and sound turned off intermittently. No one ever tried to come and fix it even though multiple people complained. I did hear the bartender say she had alerted her manager to the problem. We decided rather than be upset about it to sit any enjoy our $30 bottle of wine and laugh it up with a nearby couple watching the movie. I did however feel bad it was my cousins first time seeing the movie and she had to kind of just guess what was going on with the sound skipping and cutting in and out. \n\nThe bartender had mentioned they were playing Hocus Pocus on Saturday. We were excited to possibly come back and enjoy that Halloween favorite but after that poor display of a movie night we will save the $30 and watch it at home on Netflix.",

  "text": "For an apartment community that is over 25 years old (maybe 30), it's a decent place. There are some downfalls when living here. For one, they failed to address the soundproofing between units when remodeling. The noises are intrusive and after countless times (months) of reporting the issue noise, the problem is not resolved. \nThe trash and recycling areas are not ideal, not because the containers are too small but the recycling container needs more openings. Residents are just dumping right at the openings when there is much more room in the container which leads to overflow of trash and recycling out into the parking lot. Also some residents need overview of what is trash and what is recyclable. It would also be helpful to add two more trash and recycle areas in the corners of the community.\nThey need a better way to of ensuring the entrance codes will work. Sometimes after the third try, you cannot get in unless you use the key, but that's ok the residents keep unlocking the doors so anyone can walk in and out as they please. And people keep complaining that some items or packages get stolen....\"I wonder why?\"\n\nThe main reasons why I am leaving at the end of the year is because of the entrance doors are always unlocked which is a real security risk and the noise between units. You get no real peace with children running and yelling in the hallways and neighbors banging or slamming doors.\n\nBut if you want convenience, living here is ideal. Plenty of retail establishments in walking distance. Public transportation is ideal and you are close to major highways.",

  "text": "Yes. I am aware this is a low score, but I have to stay true to my opinion. That's what reviews are. \nI was overly excited for the opening of Gin. Everyone can agree the NOLA area needed a new Korean bbq spot. I told myself I would wait to give the business some time to get their feet off the ground and get things right before I would try it. I should have listened to myself. \nA party of 2, we got the Combo #2 for 4 people. We chose the Marinated Pork Belly, prime short rib, beef bulgogi, and the thin brisket. It came with two bowls of rice, a salad, and a plate of lettuce with zucchini on top. The sauce plate came out with soy bean paste, siracha, and whole garlic and jalapeños. There were only four banchan dishes and none of them wowed me. It was all too similar. The combo did not include tofu soup, but that's okay, they're still working on the menu. All of this for 49.99. Not bad. The meats that came out were good quality. The ones marinated were flavorful as well. \nWe also ordered the dumplings. Standard, crispy, but the ponzu sauce was good! \n\nNow to the point of the low rating of 2 stars. The service! TERRIBLE....honestly, it ruined what could have been a great experience. The server only talked to us once : to ask what we wanted to drink and order. After that plates just kept coming and that was that. I was never asked if I needed something by our server, I had to eagerly look around to see if he'd pass back so I could ask him something. Another server caught me looking for my server and sweetly asked if I needed help. That was nice. but honestly overall, the service was horrendous. The grill had burnt and we had to wait for someone to change it out, eventually had to ask. I never got more napkins that i needed; kbbq can get messy. I asked for more lettuce - traditionally, most places give you a basket of lettuce. I got a measly two pieces. I like to make lettuce wraps with the kbbq, so I asked for lettuce. Wanna know how much that cost me? 1.99 every time!!!! I paid $6 FOR LETTUCE. Did my server ever notify me of the cost? NO. Does it say it in the menu? What kind of establishment charges for lettuce??? It's kbbq! I could totally understand if you charge for rice...but lettuce? Come on. Do better. \nIf I based this on food alone, they'd get 4 stars. I've eaten kbbq in Atlanta, New York, and Dallas. I know not to hold Nola to that standard, but at least have good service. Good service can easily uplift any business.",

I called the shop and the manager, Albert told me that I ordered a medium before I even told him my name and address. I had paid by credit card in advance.

  "text": "After skimming the stellar reviews for this place, I wanted to try their food, and I was craving a banh mi, so I ordered a shrimp banh mi and shrimp summer rolls. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you this was the worst banh mi I've ever had. Like, it was a complete horror show.\n\nFirst off, I was disgusted to find that, upon taking the first bite, the shrimps still had their shells and tails on. Yuck. The bread was soft and laden with mayonnaise and soy sauce, along with copious amounts of black pepper. The soy sauce was a huge problem and reduced the roll to a soggy mess. There were way too many pickled vegetables on there, too, which added even more wetness and overpowering flavor. I don't know how, but everything that could be wrong with this sandwich, was. Nothing was right about it.\n\nThis order came to me from UberEats, but let's be clear: all of the issues described were the establishment's fault. Naturally, UE refused my refund, despite the photographic evidence and strong case made for terrible food unfit for consumption. They \"shared my concerns with the business,\" but that accomplished jack shit, as Pho Don never attempted to contact me to rectify the situation.\n\nI will say that the shrimp summer rolls were fresh, tasty, and overall excellent, hence the upgrade from one star to two.\n\nI'd be back to try some pho, albeit reluctantly, but I'm putting a personal ban on their banh mis for the rest of my natural life.",

I booked the event 3 months in advance, the event coordinator never responded to any of my calls and was never available when I visited.  I dealt directly with the manager.  The week before the event, a new events coordinator got in touch with me to introduce himself and finalize our arrangements.  We met and he assured me that he would be on hand an hour before the event so that he could assist with the setup.  He showed up just before our guest of honor arrived.  The room was so cold that our guests had to wear their winter coats during the party.  Eventually the bar tender turned the heat up.  The music from the bar was so loud that we had to shout to hear one another.  About an hour into our event, they started a tour of the distillery, which they never informed us would be occurring.  The tour guide was yelling so that he could be be heard over our party.  He moved the tour into our reserved area and start yelling even louder to sell tee shirts, all the while screaming over the guest of honor as she opened gifts.  This was a horrible venue, I suggest party hosts look to book elsewhere.",

Another employee kept raising up his hands saying he couldn't help anyone because he was currently off the clock.  \n\nThe second time we came there was only one person working concessions.  She was so slow.  The people started getting upset in the line because there was another employee at the soda machine turning them all off while there was a line of people who wanted their over priced drinks!   Then after I got to the machine, the thing was completely empty of everything but water!\n\nNow we are waiting for our 10:50 movie to start and it's 11:05.

My hair was so messed up I had to wait 5 months for my hair to grow out just so someone else could fix this butcher job!!! The color was so mat it looked like cardboard.  I called and said I want my money back and, it wasn't cheap that was for sure, and they wouldn't give it to me.  The salon thought it would be great to come back and have them fix it. I will never ever set foot in that salon. When I finally trusted another salon to fix my hair it took 9 hours.",

  "text": "SCAM ALERT! I normally would never give a one star review, but this situation is up scene. I went on a Saturday, which is five dollar euro pita day. While waiting for my order, I looked over my receipt amazed at how much I had just spent on 2 pitas and fries. That's when I noticed the discrepancy between the posted prices and what I paid. As you can see by my receipt I was barged a dollar extra per item, including the \"$5 pita\". \n\nI brought this up to the girl at the register and her response lacked any empathy. She said the owner just hadn't gotten around to changing the posted menu. SHAME on you, Little Greek. A simple sign, or Post-it notes with adjusted pricing would've easily sufficed. You're stealing from your customers! I will not be back.\n\nupdate: the owner responded to my original post, sounds like part of this was employee error (or poor training) considering I just asked for a side of fries with the order. What he failed address is the fact that I was charged more for the lamb pita than the posted price. His employee was apparently aware of that disparity as she seemed unphased when I pointed it out. Sure this 50 cents isn't a substantial difference, but on principle I stand by my original post. The food is simply not good enough to get scammed.",

So since all the tables around us were empty I thought we would then be taken care of. Nope.

So I stated  I don't understand what the issue was because of all the waiters and waitresses that were all standing around the bar with nothing to do and the response I got was OK and nothing else.

  "text": "My husband and I went through a short but intense cycling phase and didn't enjoy our experience at Soho. Firstly, they separated our bikes after they told us we'd be riding together. That didn't start our experience well at all. Then we went to the extremely small locker area with one flimsy bench for everyone cycling (i.e., dozens of people) to use. It was so cramped and obviously didn't smell pleasant with so many bodies crushed together changing shoes.\n\nThe classroom is large, but there are one or two load-bearing poles that make some bikes less desirable than others. The floor is so slippery with the cycling shoes on. I almost witnessed a pregnant woman slip and fall face-first. Thankfully, she caught herself on another bike. \n\nThere were technical issues throughout the class, with music not playing for various reasons. The instructor had to go to the back several times, which killed the energy every time.\n\nWe had been to CycleBar a lot before trying Soho, so we naturally compared everything (as is the nature of Yelp) and concluded that Soho didn't have any positives over CycleBar, which has a large locker area with multiple restrooms, carpet throughout the studio to negate slipping, stadium seating in the studio (so you're not staring at someone's butt crack the whole time), snacks, cold and tepid water dispensers, zero technical malfunctions in the many times we've gone, much more parking, and the list goes on.\n\nAfter the Soho class ended, we headed to the locker area and discovered children playing with tablets and toys on the one available bench. Again, we maneuvered through dozens of people to get our stuff together and return our shoes. Just not a comfortable experience. A staff member asked us how class went. When I said it had been \"okay,\" he didn't inquire further, which indicated to me that nobody there really cares to improve the customer experience.\n\nI'm giving two stars instead of one, because the instructor and workout were fine. It was a decent workout, and we left sweaty. It was the first and last time we'll go to Soho. I definitely recommend CycleBar instead.",

This is for the II hair salon on Washington Ave. I was told I'd need to bleach my hair twice for a color they couldn't seem to match with a Swatch when I showed them a picture (my hair is black and dye-naive). The guy, whose name I never got, told me he'd take more time to slowly bleach it...I expect some tingling during the bleaching process, but I saw red patches tinting my hair after the first bleach. Hair was washed, no conditioner used...then the second bleaching turned into a pure burn, to the point where when they added more bleach to cover spots, I felt the pain in my stomach and my whole body tingled (I normally have a decent pain tolerance). Feeling like I was about to pass out, they told me it was normal and to wait another 20 minutes...finally told them I couldn't take it and they washed it off, no conditioner for my hair. They didn't cut much hair off - even when I kept requesting it to be cut shorter. They added a grey color, which honestly looked better when it was in dye form, not finished product. They agreed to honor the coupon for 20 percent off, but somehow tacked a last-minute $20 for something, then asked for cash tip - the cash part I get, the random 20, not so much. \nI dislike the grey they told me would \"look so good\" so much I brush my hair to hide it. My scalp that night hurt so much I had to put lotion to soothe the burn! \nAnd they ruined the collar of the shirt I was wearing that day...so I spent 8 hours for a painful bleach, minimal hair cut, a ruined shirt, and mysterious pricing... I'd go for the main salon next time.",

It stated on the menu a \"Try\" is a 1.50 charge. This is so you would not have to waste money or food if you didn't like it. Unfortunately she brought the \"Whole\" appetizer. It didn't look a pealing, it was a thick slice of bologna with american cheese and BBQ sauce on-top served with crackers. We managed to eat one piece of it each. It was cold and did not taste of smoke. Underwhelming. \n     I wanted to go to the restroom to wash my hands and turned the light on the wall. It was very sticky and the bathroom was not very clean and opens into the dining room. \n     I returned to the table and the server came with our food. We ordered two, two meat dinners. The chicken was dry under seasoned, sausage had no flavor and was cool, ribs were warm but under seasoned, and the brisket was dry and had no flavor. The sides- the garlic potatoes did not taste anything like garlic potatoes they tasted of Margarine and temp was cool. The Cole slaw was good (Vinegar slaw) and the beans were Good. (Not to sweet). \n\n     I used to go here all the time for the BBQ, Brady and his mom worked hard as did the rest of the staff to see the place was clean and the food was fresh and hot. I am not sure who is working the place now. I have looked at all the reviews and there are a mixture of very bad and very good, so I am sure he and mom are still there some days. \n\n    \n     The waitress was kind and accommodating, very nice person. Generally its the food and the staff which keep you coming back to a place. I wish my experience was a better on but, I appreciate how hard the waitress worked to make us happy. \n\nWe paid our tab gladly and left a 20% tip on our purchase.

  "text": "First of all, the hotel is great. Quiet, comfy & the rooms are nice. Pool is clean & the location is top notch. One of the night staff named Patrick is probably the nicest hotel desk workers I've ever met. Now the bad.... My family & I had a room for several days over the new year. (Not cheap) On our second morning we bought all our groceries ($80) & left them in the room while we went to Clearwater Beach for the day. I had bought groceries, mugs, plastic plates, silverware,toiletries, snacks, bread, coffee, milk etc. I put the cold stuff in the fridge. I removed the DND because I wanted the towels changed etc. When we returned in the evening our room had been made but they had completely reset it and removed all my stuff - every last thing, even the stuff in the fridge. I went straight to the desk & the young man ( not Patrick this time) told me that the housekeeper would not have done this and insisted I did not have groceries! He then said he would require my original receipt from the store (Publix)to prove it. Well, young man, I have my receipt right here in my hand but here's a little lesson: I won't and don't need to show you my receipt. You, Sir, need to speak to your housekeeper. Customer service is apparently absent at this hotel.",

  "text": "I was so excited when I heard that TGI Friday's was adding the Beyond Meat Burger to their menu! I love those burgers but they are still hard to find in a restaurant, never mind a restaurant with a bar (which I prefer since I normally dine alone). \n\nHowever I was incredibly disappointed to learn that they serve this burger oozing with animal products, including cow pus and who knows what else. I knew that it came with white cheddar but I naturally assumed that it would be vegan. Well it's not, and neither is the Friday's sauce that comes with it! I mean, really? Wtf!!!!!! What kind of ass hat thought it would be a good idea to smother a perfectly good vegan burger with disgusting animal products? If I had wanted that I could have ordered a dead animal sandwich!\n\nAnyway I ordered it with no cheese or sauce. It came on a suspiciously unhealthy bun (whole wheat apparently is not \"green-style\" to these people). It was still a Beyond Burger so it still tasted good but I spent the time wondering if the bread was really edible. A close reading of the menu called the bun \"buttery\" and it certainly felt greasy enough to have butter. It literally ruined my burger. The only other bun is gluten free and I don't have celiac disease so I avoided that disaster at least.\n\nI even checked their website but the nutritional information there is utterly useless. They don't list ingredients, they don't warn you which ingredients have animal products, and their entire nutrition web page is predicated on the assumption that you will only order each item exactly as it is described on the menu (which you would hopefully never do because most of their food is disgusting).\n\nMeanwhile the Harvest Seasonal Grill in Newtown serves the Impossible Burger with vegan cheese and it's to die for. I gave up my night there to try something new and now I regret it.\n\nAlso their beer selection sucks. Hello? This is 1980, can we please have our beer list back?!?!? \n\nThis is one chain that is well overdue to fade into obscurity. So disappointed.... I would definitely give zero stars if I could. They didn't earn a star.",

So, if you enjoy slow service, mediocre food, higher prices, and a surly staff, then by all means go to Bonefish at Tyrone Mall.  My rare ahi tuna bowl came out well done and the plate was so hot neither my husband nor I could touch it.  His meal was ok, with the exception of the broccoli which had so much dirt  in it, it was inedible, however the staff thought it was comical.  We have never had this poor food or service at a Bonefish.  Blatant disregard for customer service.  And to think this is the \"slow\" season.  Snowbirds beware!",

I had the White Whiskey Lemonade which was strong and refreshing.

I was actually very disappointed. I ordered the crab bisque which was the favorite part of my meal, so I recommend that. The Cheesesteak Spring Rolls were a bit greasy and lacking flavor. The Calamari was horrible, the batter was not crispy at all. The ribeye which I ordered lacked flavor and was cooked a little more done than what I ordered for a medium steak. \n\nI left a little disappointed which was unfortunate.

Upon entering we were asked if we had a reservation (there was only one other group at a table), we said no and were asked to follow the hostess when we were ready and she moved on, I guess we were ready!\nWe were seated and waited and waited - no server. Eventually the hostess came back and asked for drinks, water was fine but unfortunately my wife asked for coffee. The water came and then the coffee. My wife added some cream from the personal jug. It curdled but she tasted the coffee - it wasn't just luke warm, it was stone cold!\nStill no sign of our server. Eventually someone came back to refill the water upon which I mentioned the coffee was cold, telling me she'd get more, I told her not to bother. We eventually ordered through the hostess, Chicken & Waffles is apparently a piece of chicken and A waffle. My wife's Eggs Benedict sat under the warming lamp for some time, she measured 9 minutes, thanks to the open kitchen and there not being too many other customers. The potato side was drowned in salt and luke warm. My 'Remedy\" I think it was called was OK except for the luke warm potato side. After this was served our server finally showed up and asked if everything was OK, at which point we just wanted to leave. After finishing what we could stomach and waiting and waiting and waiting for a modicum of attention I stood up to put my jacket on, hoping someone would see me and come over with the check - no luck. Our server was chatting in the bar area, I interrupted her for the check.\nThis place is absolutely pathetic, we observed the staff just hanging around chatting and laughing. Our server and a cook went out back to smoke and filled the inside with their leftovers.\nAgain, STAY AWAY, the myriad of food carts provide better food and service.",

For context, it is Mother's Day so it is one of the biggest brunch holidays of the year, but the overall experience could still have been better. \n\nWhen we arrived at our suggested arrival time (according to the No Wait app) there were still over 20 parties ahead of us. Trying to check in was chaotic, with the hosts simultaneously clearing tables, checking people in and trying to get food out to the tables. Over the 1.5 hour wait for a table, I observed that there did not seem to be any flow of service or well-oiled process. At least 2-3 tables were unoccupied at any given point despite the long wait, and it was not unusual that any any given moment the majority of tables did not have food on them. This was interesting to me since there seemed to be a large number of dishes waiting to be delivered to tables consistently throughout the waiting period/meal. When our party of three was finally seated at the bar, several of the dishes were already out of stock. The food was good, but nothing to write home about, especially at the price. The staff seemed stressed and all over the place. I would guess that it was understaffed for the volume, for which responsibility resides squarely on management's shoulders.\n\nI've decided after this experience I will never come back for a Sunday brunch.

  "text": "Bold prediction: Pearl Diver won't last a year\n\n...unless they make some swift adjustments. This island-themed, supposed retreat recently opened to much hype and anticipation. But based on my first visit and after reading other reviews, the post-launch buzz isn't looking good.\n\nFirst, the location is a bit of a challenge. It's on Gallatin Road, about halfway between Five Points and Fox Club/Mickey's/Walden. It's sort of on its own. And parking is very limited.\n\nSecond, and certainly most memorably for me, the entry/waiting list/line (whatever it is) situation is just an absolutely confusing disaster of a poorly thought out procedure. We walked in to find a waiting room(?) with what appeared to be a line. We gathered that there was a bit of a wait to get in (which is not a foreign concept, so no beef there), but we didn't see a host stand or anyone who appeared to be managing entry. So, initially confusing. After a few minutes, we realized that the woman wearing the hip dark green romper was in charge of letting people in. After explaining that there was a bit of a wait because they want to make sure that everyone has a comfortable experience inside, she proceeded to let three people skip the line and enter because they were friends of the owner. So whatever make-believe, good-vibes policy they're touting was just killed for me right there. Eventually, three of us got inside and grabbed a big booth in the front room. \n\nSoon after, we noticed that two of our friends had arrived and were waiting in the waiting-for-the-sake-of-waiting line, and I walked up to let the host/bouncer/romper person know that the two guys we were joining us in our booth and asked if they could join us rather than having to wait and stare at us from the waiting room. As expected, the answer was no and that everyone has to wait until there's enough room inside -- even though the room wasn't that crowded and our friends were just going to be sitting down in the booth with us.\n\nAt this point, romper bouncer started to get a little mouthy and patronizing, to which I (*ahem* the customer) took exception. She explained that the policy wasn't pretentious and that it's designed to keep people happy. As an added bonus, she also explained that she's the least pretentious person because she lives in an airstream trailer (note: basically the most pretentious thing I've ever heard). After engaging in a bit of a back-and-forth, frustrated, I eventually walked back to the booth, and our friends were eventually allowed to join us. And I say it that way, because apparently as soon as I walked away from the door, bouncer romper told my friends that 1.) it'd be a bad idea for me to come back to the door again, and 2.) she'd still let them in despite my actions.\n\nAlright. We're all inside, and eventually, we calm down after debriefing the door fiasco. I'll try to keep it brief from here on out, but I've got a lot of notes left. Besides, we're on island time and in no hurry. Maybe a list will help:\n\n1. Two of the three drinks I tried were horrible and overpriced, also noting that they charge $10 for a michelada (yep, beer and spiced tomato juice).\n\n2. It was 85 degrees out and humid AF having just rained, yet all the garage doors were open. The climate of this \"oasis\" was disgusting.\n\n3. Two one-seater bathrooms are not enough for a place of this size. Additionally, the blue lights on one of the unisex bathroom doors and pink lights on the other are confusing. Perhaps this is intended to be a clever social experiment to see if men use the blue light door and women use the pink light door, but the restroom line would run more efficiently if both were clearly indicated as unisex rather than suggesting gender-specific rooms. Just another detail that wasn't well considered.\n\n4. Two weeks in, and the paper menus were already falling apart, which just resonated with me as cheap.\n\n5. One bartender took my order by standing about three feet behind the bar, arms folded behind his back with very erect posture, and then raising one finger to his ear to indicate that he was ready for my order. How arrogant!\n\nThe decor and lightning are beautiful, and I've been reading about what the owners are trying to pull off. But relaxed, island retreat is definitely not what I experienced. If they can be bothered to listen to their customers, my recommendations are:\n\n1. Figure out your door situation -- what is your procedure and policy, and how are you going to clearly convey this to potential customers in a way that is straightforward to understand? This is the first impression. Keep it simple, and get it right.\n\n2. Based on my experience and others', it's already time for an all-staff lineup about providing customer service. Set clear expectations, and cut the fat if your employees aren't getting it done. This is incredibly basic and fundamental to your industry. Arrogant, patronizing service won't cut it.\n\nI'll take the host's advice and will skip coming back to the door.",

The waitress had no knowledge of the menu and when asked a question became very frustrated. Later I asked if we can speak to someone that had the answers to my questions (menu isn't clear) and the waitress then went to go get someone else to assist us , few minutes later she came back and says \"the owner is next door he said you can walk over and come ask him whatever questions you have\" at that point we got up and left the restaurant. Extremely un professional and showed ignorance. Won't ever come back here. Save you're selves a trip and try the many other places that have some decency on how to treat their customers or just people in general.",

Eggs were all cooked wrong (even after we sent it back), my grits and sausage were cold not to mention how gritty and inedible they also were. We got all our food out separately (there were 5 of us). The last thing we received was silverware and an extremely over cooked burger. None of my food was good and it was probably the most unsatisfying meal I have had in a while. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told I had to walk upstairs and that he/she was in a meeting at 1:30 on a Sunday. I left hoping I'd never have to suffer through a meal like that again.",

  "text": "Good food, horrible service. We dined in on May 10 for dinner. The hostess was so rude. No kind of greeting at all, not even a smile. Just asked how many and showed us to a small table that had chairs on one side and a shared booth on the other. We were there for a special occasion and the restaurant was about 25% full.. was about 7:30ish, so we asked politely if we could have one of the many open booths. She rolled her eyes and said they were all reserved, and we can sit on the \"booth side\" of the table, which made no sense since only 2 people could fit on that side. I knew that could not be true given that it was a weeknight and almost 8pm so I pointed to one of the smaller booths and said even that one was reserved? Another eye roll, then she said \"I mean....\" like we were being difficult by asking and said \"fine, whatever\". Clearly had a lot of attitude and was just all around rude. Once we sat our server was friendly, food came out quickly and was tasty. After that we didn't see her much and no refills on water, took forever to order dessert and get the check. I never did get my water refilled. The family next to us had to get the manager because they were sitting down so long and hadn't even been greeted. The manager was nice and was able to help them, but that shouldn't have been necessary, that serve only had 3 tables, one bring ours and by that point she wasn't even stopping by. No complaints on the food, but not worth coming in for the rude hostess and slow service. So many other options in cool springs now.",

I would recommend saving your dollars (especially if it all looks like you're not rollin in the dough) and go somewhere with equally as tasty food for 1/4 of the price.

I got my food, I ordered scrambled eggs, pork roll and sausage. The first round of pork roll was ok so I order more and it was bad. To burnt and way to greasy. I started to eat my sausage, finished them and ate the potatoes it came with. Half way through the potatoes, I found hair. I took it off my plate and on the floor. I FOUND ANOTHER PIECE OF HAIR. That's absurd. I shouldn't have to worry about hair in my food. It was a good place until I good my food. I highly doubt I will return to The Turning Point.",

  "text": "The restaurant is on a small street and you have to ring the doorbell to get in. The decor is really cool and cozy with dark lighting and rug-lined walls. Everything was great at first, the staff was nice and our first waiter explained everything we needed to know about the 7-course meal. After that moment, everything went downhill. \n\nI think our second waiter was new so he got our first course mixed up with the hand washing part. He didn't seem to really care that he made a mistake and was very nonchalant about it as well.\n\nAfter we washed our hands, the first three courses were served together with stale pita bread. There was one delicious eggplant dish and two underwhelming salads, one being what tasted like boiled carrots and a simple cucumber and tomato with vinegar dressing. \n\nAfter the waiter took that away, he brought us a pastry looking pie that was over dusted with powdered sugar. The filling tasted vaguely like bland rubbery egg whites and maybe tofu? I don't know, it was all very confusing. \n\nWhen this plate was taken away, we waited a whole hour and a half before the next dish came out. During this time no one came to ask us if we needed anything. We had no water, no help, and definitely no explanation as to why we had to wait so long for the next course. \n\nWhen someone finally asked us if we needed water, to which we responded yes, it never actually came. That happened twice within the two hours we were there.\n\nFinally, the chicken dish came out and it looked like an over boiled baby chicken with a lemon slice on top. I feel like it probably doesn't take an hour to make this under seasoned chicken so I'm not sure what happened there but we had to wait another half hour (2 hours total now) before we decided we could no longer wait for the rest of the meal. So we asked for everything else to-go and to get the check. At this time, the waiter finally explained to us that the oven was broken but it was too late. \n\nOf course the check took another 30 minutes to come. By the time we left I couldn't tell if I was more mad about waiting 2.5 hours for nothing or about paying $160 (with gratuity already having been included in the bill for you) for five people to wait 2.5 hours. \n\nI got home and tried the kabob. It was dry, over-cooked and super bland. All in all, I'm probably never going back. The food was not good and the service could've been so much better.",

This Sonic was sooooo bad it makes me give all other Sonics a second guess. \nExit 195 in Bellevue, TN. \nA big fat 0 stars-minus 5 stars!",

Yes, there is a woman in the service dept. parades around as the service manager who is extremely rude, condescending and purposely tries to upset you with her arrogance so she can go on a power trip and try withholding your car key they did not return after the service.\n\nPLEASE BEWARE OF THE LIFETIME FREE OIL CHANGE PROGRAM being offered with new car purchases as this is only going to be honored IF you pay for all those major services regardless if they are already done by another company or simply are not necessary. I just found out today that because I get free tire rotation with FOUNTAIN TIRE (excellent company who stands behind their agreements without playing games) whom I purchased the tires from (in which they will inspect my brakes for wear and tear etc) I refused to pay the unnecessary $340 plus tax (service #3) fee that my free lifetime oil changes will NOT be honored!!! I asked if I was expected to read the pages of fine print to confirm the salesman wasn't lying about \"no hidden catches\" to this free oil change deal being offered - really it was built into the cost of the car but lets let them think they are doing us a real favor as stupid consumers!! - I was told \"yes\" so lesson learned today: West Edmonton Hyundai admitted the salespeople will lie to get the sale then will tell you that you should have read every word of the entire contract before buying the car to make sure the truth was being told! Lesson #2: this company is very unethical!",

Very judgemental, office staff is rude.  Boarded my dogs there and one got bit and the wound infected. They did take care of this for free but the first vet that looked at the dog did not prescribe any antibiotics and did nothing for the dog just sent her home with my daughter. the dog had been bitten on the paw and the puncture had gone all the way through the animals paw. It seems to me that any reasonable vet  would have prescribed antibiotics but no. the final straw for me though was when I found out that Yelp would not even allow these people to buy an advertisement on Yelp because their score was so low.

Everyone's checks were wrong. Not a single check was correct, with food orders and drinks mismatched, charges incorrect, just a plethora of issues. \n\nManagement here is horrible, the staff is rude and dismissive, the food was cold, undercooked and overpriced for what it was, and this was just a bad experience.

I ordered a salad and burger.  I waited over an hour to get my food.  I was so hungry.  Little did I know that it would take an hour and 45 minutes to eat here.  I would not return, especially if I was in a hurry.  I would have left after 30 minutes after ordering, but I didn't want to be rude.  Very disappointed!",

The catfish wasn't catfish anymore and it was squishy. The mushrooms weren't whole anymore, they were stems and pieces that tasted like chemicals.  The sesame chicken was squishy and tasteless and the orange chicken tasted anything but orange. Those were the only things that I liked there to begin with and now they taste weird and uncooked.  After 10 minutes we went to pay and leave and the manager or owner or whoever the guy was asked us what was different and when we told him, he said they never served catfish, they never served whole mushrooms and they have always had the same cook.  He laughed and made us pay the full price, even for the un-carbonated sodas. If you want to get treated poorly and leave hungry, eat here.",

  "text": "Just got off the \"Paradise\" 6 days 5 nights to Cozumel and Grand Cayman. Perfect weather! Crew very hospitable. Jamie, cruise director had great sense of humor. Ship a little dated. (19 years old)  Lots of red hues. Rooms comfortable but needed a shampoo on our,  what else, red rug and a thorough dust/wipe down on top of TV, on top of clothes closet etc. We breath that air for 5 days. No windows\nin room. Not too much to ask.   \nFood extremely disappointing. Breakfast good though. Boiled eggs were boiled. Bacon cooked. Not many choices for dinner (one assigned dining room) and a lot of recycling of menu items. When I see a short rib or a lamb shank on the menu,  I am expecting meat attached to a bone. Shrimp cocktail is micro size. Drink/ Alcohol plans are great if you are a lush and want to pay flat rate $60 per day, (including port days). Otherwise you pay as you go, ie  $12 for pre-made LI ice teas w tax/and 15% tip.  Entertainment was pedestrian at best, ie a \"rock show\" with no rock band. Nothing even close to off off broadway. The \"theature\" where you sit had virtually no seat backs, very uncomfortable....an invitation to leave.  Don't get internet package because $88 gets you a frustratingly bad wifi connection.  Why do you get  wifi included on Jet Blue at 35,000 feet and bad wifi from Carnival Cruise for $88 at sea level? Just asking. Oh yea, we lost all water on board for 3 hours in the middle of my shower. Not too confidence inspiring to have no water in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  Anyway, Carnival Paradise is been there done that.  Time to move on. It seems as if Carnival has stopped trying.",

I went 12/30 and there was literally no stock of men's underwear. Unless you wanted a 4XL in bright red you were out of luck. Same story with the undershirts. I understand it was right after Christmas but there was almost a week after the holiday. It's unacceptable for a retail store to be in this situation. Especially when you're paying $25 for underwear and undershirt. On top of all of this, when I got home, the undershirt that was in the box was the wrong one. Shirt was a v neck and box said classic tee.",

Our order was taken and didn't see the server again. After a half hour, we asked some other server what was going on, and she said she will go check on it. Never saw her again either. Another half hour we asked someone else and he said it would be a minute. Eventually brought our food out. Cold. We got our check and said we were not going to pay for the food we barely touched because it took an hour to get it. They took off the food on the bill, but didn't even apologize. Normally I would think a place would have the courtesy of removing even the beers as a \"sorry for screwing you over\", but they didn't even recognize they messed up. Also, the servers standing by the counter in the front had to use their phones to see. When you put on a little light in a dark room, you'll see shadows moving across the screen. And that we did.\nAt least I got to see the movie; I sat behind the handicapped section and because of the way it was set up, a handicapped viewer had no where to sit. (He was on crutches - hey ignorant employees, not every disability requires a wheelchair.) So I would especially not recommend this place if you have a disability.",

His sandwich was very yummy, I loved the addition of hard boiled eggs. My burger unfortunately was a mess. First off I ordered it medium, which should be pink inside, what I got was well done. At well done that delicious meat is no longer juicy it is dry and flavorless. Our server took forever to come check on us, and we were 1 of maybe 5 tables! When he finally came back I told him my burger was over cooked and he offered to make another, we had already waited so long at this point I was hesitant but he persisted and offered to box it up to go. 10 more minutes later we get our check and my burger to go and he \"kindly\" gave us $4 off our bill. So I get home and cut my burger and once more it's not cooked properly, very inconsistent sear on the meat- if a chef can't cook a burger properly we have a problem! Overall I might return for a salad but that burger was horrible, no flavor, no juicy-ness, the \"brandy\"sauce was non existent and the bun far to big and dry. I'll stick to The Parish where the chef knows how to properly cook and dress a burger.",

After going here for service and warranty work for the past 9 months I feel I can say with confidence that this is the worst Nissan Dealership for service in the STL area. They are sloppy in their work and generally not very trust worthy either due to a lack of dedication or cost savings. They have been promising a new building for the past year but I'm seeing much going on there and the service waiting area is a lot like a bus terminal waiting room. I could get into the particulars but I think its best to say that there are way better nissan service dealers close by. I do know the service staff has turned over in the past year so perhaps there is the possibility for improvement, but I have this one car I paid a lot for that I can not afford to have serviced poorly.",

The menu looked great and the prices were reasonable, as advertised on the website! What was not as advertised, however, was the ability to \"online order and delivery\". \n\nWhat's ironic is that the website provides a very nice order tracker. What's not nice is that I've been able to see that my meal has been ready for an hour and it's still not here. Does not really make the meal feel appetizing.\n\nAfter speaking with the delivery person, who was admittedly very friendly and apologetic, I reached out to the store to understand how this could have happened, given I placed my order at 5:40 and we're now tracking 2 hours of waiting, I expected a reasonable understanding of my disappointment and was greeted with what started as friendly service and ended with her hanging up on me. Really not the right way to approach a hopeful repeat customer. I thought I had found my indian restaurant of choice here, and I see I will have to continue searching.",

  "text": "Kanella Grill and Kanella South used to be my two favorite restaurants in the city - so much so that we arranged to have our wedding reception at Kanella South through a brunch buyout of the entire restaurant, to be held in May 2018, after months of searching for the perfect space as we are not typical \"wedding people.\"  We placed a deposit of $1,200 in October to reserve the date.  In January following the holidays we made reservations to eat dinner there and to get in the mood for the final lead up to the wedding.  I received a hasty voicemail only hours before our reservation stating that they couldn't honor our reservation because the restaurant is temporarily closed, and, as an aside, as they reopen we would be the first phone call they make regarding our buyout.  Naturally with the wedding only a few months away, we began to investigate alternatives and requested our deposit back.  That voicemail was the last I heard from them despite several emails and attempts to get my deposit back.  The space is up for rent - and still no communication or apology from Kanella.  It was only through filing a dispute with my credit card company that I finally received my deposit back.  They never even offered to transfer our buyout to their other location.  (That wouldn't have worked for our guest count, but they had an opportunity to try to keep their money.)  I have seen from Open Table that other guests have shown up for reservations that were made after the restaurant closed.  I firmly believe that had we not had the buyout arranged we would not have even received the aforementioned phone call.  Needless to say, we will never patronize Kanella again, and I would especially caution anyone considering doing a larger group event there (we've seen a number of rehearsal dinners and other special occasions).",

  "text": "This place was fine but wow the customer service? I booked on Expedia and wanted a room with 2 beds for me and my mom. And we get there and we open the door to the room and there was ONE bed. So I go down to the front desk to complain and they're like \"sorry but when you book on those sites, you get what you get,\" and then proceeded to tell me that basically if you want a GOOD room that meets your needs, you have to book through them. So I went like 2 days kicking myself and wishing I wouldn't have used Expedia UNTIL...a wedding party showed up and a million people were spending the night plus we went to the nearby Cheesecake Factory and that waitress confirmed our suspicions-they overbooked. And instead of fucking over the wedding guests, they fucked US over. And instead of giving me a night for free or something, they brought a COT up to our room. My mom tried it out but said it was too uncomfortable so we had to SHARE. THE BED. Thankfully the bed was a king so it wasn't too uncomfortable to share but it was just ridiculous. What kind of customer service is that? They should've put on Expedia that they were full (like they had done a previous weekend I tried to book and found they were full) and they DEFINITELY should've given me a free night or free nights for a next visit or just SOMETHING. And they did nothing. The one woman at the front desk gave me lowkey attitude about it too. All the other staff other than that one woman was very nice, I will say that. I think if I wanna come back and stay in that area I'll book at the next door hotel, the Hyatt House though because I'm not taking the chance that I'm not gonna have my room accommodations met again",

  "text": "My worst dining experience in more than 10 years. My Open Table reservation said I needed to eat dairy free. I asked the waitress to confirm with the chef that what I was ordering was dairy free. She said it was no problem. When they brought out my food, it had mashed potatoes and a butter sauce. The waitress said oh, okay, I will bring you the menu so you can order something else. The manager came over to the table and proceeded to loudly berate me for raising my voice. He said they can't get every order right, and these things happen and I shouldn't be so upset. He then went on to say that he would not let me speak unless I lowered my voice. The noise level in the restaurant was so high that I had to raise my voice to be heard. He then continued talking, and talked over me when I tried to speak. He kept yelling at me to calm down (even though I wasn't saying anything because he wouldn't let me). He eventually brought me a different meal (grilled chicken and steamed broccoli) and they charged us full price for it.\n\nThis restaurant made my birthday celebration a disaster. The manager was so rude to me my friends couldn't believe it. The noise level was exorbitant, the spaces so narrow you had to ask people to move so you could get down the steps to the bathroom. The waitress eventually came over and apologized, claiming it was a miscommunication between her and the chef.\n\nDo not go here unless you like rude service and people who obviously do not and cannot listen to a word you are saying. They only have about six tables, but that was obviously too many for them.",

However we've had dinner from here 3 times and each time it wasn't anything flavorful that I would brag about. We didn't complain because each of those times we paid with food vouchers they kindly provided to my job around Christmas time.   I figured it was petty to complain about free food.    \n\nWe tried them again some months later and got break fast deliver thru Postmates. It was DELICIOUS! We were so satisfied!!! So we thought maybe they are better with breakfast , another few weeks pass and we decided we're going to order the exact same thing because it was so delicious last time.  This time we were less than pleased . I was upset honestly.    I ordered hash browns with my eggs SUNNY SIDE UP.   The whole purpose is to mix the egg yolk with my hash browns... but when I got my food my yolk was cooked all the way through.  I had to sit my eggs to the side because I can't eat it cooked like that.   I asked to have onion and chz added to my hashbrowns.. they upcharged me 5$ dollars for ONION & CHZ. Which ended up being a big mistake anyways. They gave me damn near a whole onion! Disgusting ! It ruined what was left of my meal.   And the cheese the did add they didn't even put on the hash browns , they put them on the side of the box so I had a bunch of melted cheese stuck on aluminum foil. So I had to pick out 75% of the whole onion they cut and added, and if I wanted to eat any of the cheese I paid 5$ for then I'd have to eat foil shreds as well.  \n\n\nVery very displeased.    Out of 5 or 6 meals from this joint I only loved one of them.",

  "text": "Just spent over an hour there for lunch. The restaurant was maybe half full. You seat yourself, so I grabbed a booth. My wife was right behind me. As I was sitting down a server came by and said she would bring another menu. There was only one menu on the table. More than 10 minutes later another server came by and asked if we had been helped. We never got the other menu, but we ordered. I ordered unsweet iced tea with lemon. She brought the tea, no lemon, no artificial sweetener. My wife ordered tacos, so prior to getting our food I asked for some extra napkins, and a refill on the iced tea. We never got the napkins. Long after we had our food another server came by and refilled my tea. My steak sandwich was terrible. Tough as nails, and the bread was dried out with no taste. I never got a chance to tell our server that it was subpar because it was a long time before we ever saw her again. She brought our check, and another 10 minutes goes by, we are needing to leave, so I took the check and money to an inept bartender. She had not had a single customer since we'd gotten there, but she acted like I was bothering her. She asked the name of our server. I told her I wouldn't know that, because she never introduced herself. She leaves, finds our server towards the back. Our server proceeds to glare at me and is talking to the bartender. The bartender comes back, has a hard time figuring out that on a $31 check she owes me $9 change. Finally, she entered it on a calculator, and gave me back 9 one dollar bills. It was a tossup to go to this place, or back to ML Rose. Wish to gosh we had done the latter. Wow! What an awful experience.",

  "text": "I'm giving two stars. One for a pretty atmosphere and for not getting food poisoning. One for a really nice server named Caleb that tried to fix the situation (can't unspill milk and disappointing sushi). But that is being generous. I walked in and asked if the bar was open seating. The hostess said yes so I went to the bar. It's a big U shape around the bar and sushi chef's. I sat and sat...for 15 minutes. I walked there so didn't just want to jump up to leave. The sushi Chef's were three feet from my face and acted so akwardly. Like I was weird for looking at them. Never even a hello. The bartenders kept serving other people to both my left and my right but wouldn't even acknowledge my presence. It was so AWKWARD!!! I felt embarrassed and annoyed. A server named Caleb said that I sat at the Sushi bar technically, one seat off of the actual bar. There was no marker or distinction at all. Nobody wanted to help me because they had not been told that they had been seated and I was one stool off from the bar so the bartenders didn't want to help me because I was not theirs. Total BS!!! It wasn't even busy in there. The three sushi Chef's were younger guys snivveling about hooking up with some girl from \"da club\" and the sports on TV. The rice in the sushi was not fully done, not sticky enough and my tiny quarter round value roll fell apart on each piece. They had no idea what GOBO is and again engaged with me in a way like I had worms crawling out of my ears for asking a question. I asked about the Ramen and I was told nobody had tried it and it was a newer fad to the area. Doea anyone here actually know anything about Japanese food  or service? They  didn't on this night clearly. I honestly came here for the Ramen as that's a staple for me. My serving dishe was being removed as I was still eating. I had to grab my plate back!!! Could this possibility get any more awkard? The people on each side of me were given complimentary edamame and I just sat there watching them enjoy. So the manager comes out to talk to me.....here I am a female alone at the bar embarrassed yet AGAIN and the person to my right said it must be embarrassing, and it was. I went on a Thursday alone because it was advertised as ladies night and thought I would be less uncomfortable going alone. I'm a travel nurse and have to find comfortable places to go alone often. Cannot recommend this to fellow travelers or females flying solo. The manager gave me a $9 ladies night discount an hour early of ladies night pricing that started at 9pm. I still was only a few dollars short of $50 even still for eating alone (with sake) on a Thursday when. I went home still hungry and super unsatisfied. I still tipped Caleb 20% for effort though he needs to get more comfortable with their new menu and not take a plate away from a guest still eating. He was the only part worth gratuity. I was going to withhold this review and try again, but I feel ripped off for what I got, how I felt and what I paid. There are too many other places to go here.",

The onion rings were run of the mill, slightly over cooked, and flavorless, aside from tasting like fried grease.  The seasoned fries were very much overpowering after the first couple of bites.

After having seen many other patrons come and go, having ordered, eaten, and left in the time it was taking for us to get our food.\n\nOverall, the place was pure chaos and the food wasn't worth the hassle.",

I got the thin crust sausage pizza and a side of the garlic Parmesan fries. Honestly, the food wasn't good. My friend got deep dish pizza and seemed to like it. The dough was horrible although the cheese was good. The garlic Parmesan fries were basically cold and the ranch on the side was some of the worst ranch I've ever had. I don't think I'll be back. 2 stars are for the server keeping our drinks full and acknowledging the food was taking a while. Oh well",

  "text": "We were very excited about trying this place after driving by for such a long time. We were looking for something fresh and new (an after Church hobby of ours) and this popped up on a search for a brunch spot on Gulf Blvd. It all started off well with a call to see that they were open and not flooded with Mother's Day business. The lady on the phone sounded so welcoming and friendly we were anxious to give this a try. It's a great space, cool atmosphere and amazing location it checks a lot of boxes for regular place to visit. They had a special menu today and it was a bit pricey for us($18 per person for brunch is a hundred bucks with drinks and tip). They did have a few items A-La-Carte and that's what we ordered from. They had great live music but for a concrete floor, open floor plan, small space it was way too loud. Folks were yelling at one another to have a conversation over the music. It was good music and seemed to be a talented young girl but wow, was it overwhelming how loud it was when she was belting out some notes. \nThen there are the employees talking about the customers. Some of us are messy, esp the folks that left the table next to us with the kids. Some of us are stupid apparently according to the employees that were talking over the music loud enough for us to hear. I guess the line to the order counter should wrap around the counter and not be a straight line from what the employees were saying to one another. I hope we didn't do anything to upset them while we were there....... the food was good. My chicken salad was very fresh and tasty the steak sand was delicious that my oldest started and I finished, haha! Overall, a nice place, decent food and cool atmosphere but fighting to talk over brunch and worrying that you'll be judged by the staff is not something we'll come back for. Go North just a bit and you'll find a \"Sweet\" spot that has yet to disappoint. Although I'm sure they have clients that aren't perfect also, they must discuss it out of ear shot of the customers.",

  "text": "Went here for a full eyelash extension and while it did the job initially for the first few days and no matter how much I took care of them exactly as told they would fall out constantly. I even purchased the recommended items to care for my faux eyelashes. During our conversation there she seemed to not believe what I had to say about myself she was asking me questions like I was being interrogated. The lady doing my eyelashes left an eyelash glued incorrectly making it going into my eye. I had walked out the door just to turn around and my eye was seriously injured. She acted to not care and made it seem I was making a bigger deal than it was and needed to get over it. All I said is one eyelash seems to be out of place and it's hurting my eye and I can't seem to fix it on my own.\nThe worst part of my experience was when all the false eyelashes fell out I realized the worker lady from Uptown Charm cut off all my natural eyelashes. I did notice she was using scissors but I just thought she was cutting the false eyelashes. It has taken me almost a year for my eyelashes to grow back to a decent size.",

  "text": "We booked this through Hotwire.  Extremeley cheap, however think of that when booking on the strip amongst $300 a night places.  they have two buildings on the proeprty and when you park on the south side, it'll take you about 5-10 minutes to find the lobby to check in (hint its not on either the front or back). The beds were absolutely horrible  you'll sink into them like Fester on the Addams family movie.  I can deal with old run down rooms, however the glazing on the bath tub was peeling away, there used to be an exhaust fan in the bathroom which appears to have burnt out and covered up with a generic light.  The room we were in was adjoining to the next.  The walls were so thin that we would hear the people talking next door.  They were a bit loud a times but even their dull talking felt like they were sitting in our room.  Towels, there weren't enough towels or washcloths for the 4 of us.  The only icemaker in the one building was broke-you had to walk to the second building to get ice.  \n\nOverall, Ive learned my lesson.  I'll pay a bit of extra money next time.

  "text": "My God I have never experienced such a poorly managed hotel in my life. We waited 5 hours to check into our room. 5 hours. 5. \n\nFirst it wasn't ready. We waited 1.5 hours for them to text us that the room was ready and we never heard anything. Go back wait in line 20 mins, get keys to a room, walk a mile to it, only to find another family occupying it. Walk a mile back, wait 30 mins in line, get new keys. Walk a tad further than before, get to the room and the room is a single bed when I requested a double. Call customer service, wait on hold for 40 mins, I'm told they have a room for me, I need to walk back down and get keys. Walk down get keys, talk to manager. Manager assures me the room is any upgrade as we have been trying to get to our room for 4 hours at this point.  Get to the new room, which is further away, with the manager in tow, new room is occupied too! At this point I want to cry. I'm exhausted from walking and dragging 3 kids and luggage through this massive place. We wait another 30 mins in the hallway for new room. Finally get a room at 9. All of the hoilday events we wanted to do were over. We missed everything I planned to do. 5 hours after we tired to check in, we were finally able to sit down and not fight the crowds here. \n\nYou would think that was enough right? Nope. Wake up to find that I've been involuntarily checked out of the room at 930 am. I was supposedly given late check out of 4pm.They fix it. I leave and come back to shower and there is no hot water. I called the front desk to inquire and I'm informed that I was checked out again! Involuntarily. Now I'm told that it will be 2 hours before I can get new keys delivered. It only took 30 mins, so that's a plus, I guess. \n\nThis was a complete waste of my money and more importantly, my time. I spent more time searching for a room or talking about the issues than I did enjoy the \"resort\". They gave me points on my rewards account, but at this rate, I don't think I would ever stay at this place ever again. Ever. It was a terrible experience for me and my kids.",

  "text": "We had a very bad feeling about this place the moment we pulled in...\n\nSun City Stables made a big deal about booking a reservation, so we did a day in advance and arrived 5-10 minutes before our scheduled time to ride so we could get the paperwork done and pay. When we arrived, there were no signs for an office or any indication as to where we should go to sign the waivers and pay. There was no one out in the fields, so we walked around and looked at the animals, waiting for someone to appear. So I'm not really sure why I needed a reservation - I guess so we could just be ignored and not have any employee out to greet us on time? As we walked around we saw the goats, and other small animals in their \"petting zoo\"...  they look like they aren't taken care of. (Dirty water dishes, no protection from the sun).\n\nAfter about 10minutes of looking at the animals some guy yelled something inaudible at us from across the field... so we walked over to him and he said he had the waivers for us. We took the waivers and said we would fill it out while we walked around and checked out the horses. We were filling out the forms and looking at the available horses to ride... some looked okay but the others didn't look like they were in good shape... some actually looked really sick and un happy. On top of this they didn't even have any horses ready (weren't brushed - had burrs in their mane, and there were no saddles out) - by this time it was about 20 minutes past our reservation. \n\nWe were still on the fence about riding, but filled out the waiver and started walking back over to the only employee that seemed to be there that day (Friday Feb 23rd). In the meantime two more women showed up and were talking to the employee. We handed him our forms, and he continued to talk to the new people that showed up while we stood there waiting.... we stood there for another 5 minutes while he talked to these new people and continued to essentially ignore us (at this point in time it was 10:50, we had been there for 30 minutes already and still hadn't paid yet, and didn't have any idea which horses we were going to ride). We were so fed up with the poor customer service and so sad to see how a lot of the animals were not taken care of - we just walked away. \n\nJust a terrible establishment all around.",

  "text": "My experience here was on the border between okay and disappointing.  First, I like to be greeted immediately upon walking into a restaurant, and the delayed greeting came just the second before I was about to turn and find another place.  There are posters all over advertising blended juices that are fresh made daily; when we asked for one, we were told that the juicing had not been done yet.  At 10:30 in the morning, at a breakfast restaurant, and they had not started any juice?  The server did not offer to make any, or say yes but there is a 20 minute wait, or any other suggestions that ended with me getting juice.  She seemed pretty disengaged the entire meal.  I had to ask for a water refill, and I should not have to ask when my glass is clearly empty.  The restaurant was not busy.  Everything about this just made me feel complainy.  My eggs benedict was enjoyable; the english muffins were a bit blackened on the edges but the ham, eggs, and hollandaise were decent.  The pumpkin waffles were great.  However, you'll see in the photo that there is a giant scoop of cinnamon butter on the waffle, which tasted great but was cold and the waffle was not hot enough to melt it even a little bit.  We ended up slicing it into pieces to eat with the waffle bites.  My dining partner got one of the egg skillets and said it was meh just okay but pretty boring flavor-wise.  Our server dropped off the check and did not mention whether we were supposed to pay her or go up front, which typically is a good thing to tell customers.  (pay up front is the answer).  Overall this is a very generic breakfast restaurant that could easily be swapped out for any other, and there is no particular reason to choose this one.  The juice could have brought it that extra step up.  If you're going to advertise a differentiator, it is important to actually have it ready for customers, or it becomes a bigger disappointment than not having advertised it at all.",

  "text": "I purchased a full bedroom & living room set from Badcock on Jan. 15th in cash.  Because I did not finance, I must go through a song & dance every time I call in (which is now about 20+ times).  It is now March 8th & they have not rectified the issues as of yet.  Although folks in the store location were helpful, the corporate Mulberry FL location is absolutely horrible.  Not 1, 2 or a few pieces of furniture showed up damaged.  Every single piece had an issue found once the dust was removed from everything (yes, covered in layers of dust).  I'm not a picky person & furniture will get normal wear & tear but not on first delivery. Upon the second delivery, I was told by the delivery driver \"you will want to keep what you have because what is on the truck is worse.\"  He was referring to the 2 chairs at the cost of $399 each, a smashed bedside rail, 2 scratched nightstands & a damaged dresser.  \n\nThe company apparently only has a single person that can make authorized decisions on what is to be done in situations such as this (now after looking at reviews, mine is not unique).  I finally received a call from this person after submitting a general inquiry on their website for a \"contact us\" & not one of the many conversations or voicemails I had to leave.  I was offered multiple discounts if I were to keep the furniture & a tech would be out to correct any of the issues.  Mistakenly, I agreed to this & I have not received any refunds nor any calls to schedule a technician.  I came home from work Monday to a \"Sorry We Missed You\" note from Badcock...odd as no one has spoken to me or scheduled. \n\nFriendly store personnel, mediocre quality furniture with ill craftsmanship & terrible customer service, follow-up & ensuring wrongs done by Badcock are made right.",

  "text": "On 11/29/17 I came to the dealership for an oil change on my 2015 K900.\nSeveral salesmen approached my husband and I about leasing a new car.  In the end we got a 2017 Cadenza. We were told that we would receive a check in the amount of the payoff and we were to send it to KIA Finance for payment to close account. First off when does the customer make the payoff for a dealership? We received a check and sent to KIA Finance only to find out that it was not the correct amount and we still owed a months payment.  When speaking with KIA we were told that they had never received a call for the payoff on our account. They also advised that dealerships used a third party company to obtain payoff information and that their figures were always a month short.  We were told by the salesman not to make December's payment as it was not due until the 17th and the payoff would be done prior to that date.  We made advance payment for Cadenza with the next payment due on the first of January.  Now we are supposed to pay another months payment to KIA as the payoff was not correct. At this time I am unable to make this payment. Fuccillo is refusing to reimburse us the months payment they shorted us. We also had problems when dealing for our K900, and as I have seen in other reviews it was a switch and bait situation. The General Manager did call us and corrected the problem.\nI have enjoyed the two vehicles but will not deal with this dealership again. Be very careful when trying to make a deal. If we do not receive the payment owed us we will take the next step of contacting the Better Business Bureau and filling a compliant.",

This is not the first time this happens to me, I have come here before and it's always the same people, always the same thing.

  "text": "I was hoping to find a great acupuncturist in Philly with an intuitive approach. I regularly go to receive acupuncture when I was living on the West Coast for chronic migraines, regular maintenance and general preventative care. I've been receiving acupuncture since I was a kid, introduced to Eastern type of treatments for over three decades. So, I'm quite familiar with the process and nothing is lost in translation. I'm shocked that my experience could even be the same place as the great reviews I've read on Yelp. I've never written a poor review, but really felt this experience was unacceptable. \n\nUpon calling, the receptionist was pleasant and seemed accommodating, setting my acupuncture, plus a 60 min massage for Sunday. Quoted first time, $60 for the acupuncture session and $60 for the 60 minute massage. But after suffering the start of a migraine a day earlier, I called to find out if I could move one day earlier. They said no problem and to get there earlier in the day.\n\nWhen I got there I was led to the the doctor's office and waited while he played an iPad game. I sat in his office and waited and watched him. I briefly got to sharing about my migraine, tried to explain about my other issues - usually giving more details helps with the overall prognosis, but all he took note was migraines and allergies. He never asked my age, diet, menstrual cycle, or checked my vitals i.e. pulse, tongue, or eyes.\n\nSo below is the run-down of the top things that irked the experience the most.\n\n1. Quoted one price, but was charged 1/3rd more. They explained there are additional charges for needling your front and back body, but the doctor gave me a discount.\n2. When asked for advice on how to prevent migraines and maintaining over health through tips of diet, sleep, exercise, etc? He didn't ask what my current diet was, but advised me to eat protein and really emphasizing eating soy, which is completely counterintuitive to what I've been informed. \n3. I asked a few questions about what to avoid and letting him know I had taken migraine meds before getting there. His response was \"Western medications aren't good to take for migraines, it'd be better to take natural herbs.\" When asked which ones...no response.\n4. His assessment/recommendation for acupuncture was to come every week for allergies (which I've had cured seasonally in one session for over 10 years) and dismissively said it's not necessary to come regularly for the migraines, unless I have them. No mention of any of the other issues I tried to communicate. \n5. At the end of the session, he quickly removed the needles, told me I was done and walked out. It was only later when I looked in the mirror did I realize my new mole in the hairline was actually a blob of dried blood.\n6. Lastly, the kicker was the massage appointment I initially booked never happened. They argued about who they could call and then informed me it can't happen today. I'm not fluent in Mandarin, but I could  understand they called multiple people that refused to come in.\n\nNow after over 24 hours later, still with a nagging mild migraine and post writing the review. I realized that under my skin a blood spot has developed.  In over 30+ years I have never had this happen. I religiously care and remove every mole & freckle...and now I have a new one from yesterday's session. \n\nSadly, I had high hopes seeing as the Yelp reviews are/were quite good. Maybe it was just a really off day. I didn't manage to catch the Dr. name. I hope this review helps others that are looking for someone long-term care, this was a completely disappointing, daunting and ineffective experience. So, safe to say, I'm still \"shopping\".",

I attempted to reach out to discuss this matter the CC prior to posting on Social Media but they are non responsive. \n\n-They are great at taking new patients but that is about it.\n-If you are do not schedule an appointment in the office or they have to reschedule due to the office hours changing it is nearly impossible to reach the scheduling POC. My wife played phone tag with the scheduler for nearly a week.\n-The office is NOT interested in sick visits for kids. Our kids go to daycare and as such from time-to-time they are exposed to disease. Our oldest son (16 months old) has needed to see the Pediatrician 4 times due to illness. Each time we attempted to schedule a sick visit we were essentially told there was no availability. Beyond the actual mechanics of attempting to see a provider for a sick visit, the on-call nurse seems to be grossly overworked and is not responsive. Call back time is at least four hours later. (Side note, last time we contacted the office for a sick visit, the on-call nurse advised us that there was nothing to worry about (eye puss) and that daycare should not have any issue taking him back. The next day, daycare called and asked him to leave. We contacted CC Pediatrics for a sick visit and again, they were not accommodating. Ultimately we ended up taking our 16-month to an urgent care. At the urgent care, the Doctor was so concerned about his vision being harmed they asked if he could identify colors yet. Regrettably, he cannot so at present we are hoping that this eye issue has no long term impact on his vision).\n\nLong-story short, in my opinion, a Pediatricians is supposed to be one of the most stable and important relationships in a child's life. CC Pediatrics seems completely disinterested in acting as an important part of my children's life. They primarily seem interested in collecting revenue from well visits and not actually engaging when medical attention/advice is truly needed.",

  "text": "Went here with two friends looking for some spicy food.\n\nWe got the \"special appetizer,\" which was a sampler with a samosa and some kebabs. It was great, the meat was seasoned wonderfully.\n\nOne of my friends got the goat vindaloo, \"as hot as you can possibly make it,\" I got the paneer makhari, medium, and my friend got the goat bhuna, also medium.\nOur food came out reasonably quickly, not particularly short or long. My dish was a beautiful red color, really impressive to look at, and the flavors were very nice. No perceptible heat, though, which was surprising since I ordered a medium.\nMy friend's goat vindaloo had a bit of heat, but I would class it as solidly mild. Tasty, just not spicy.\n\nI read other reviews that talk about this place having VERY spicy food, and I'm honestly just confused. Did we use the wrong words when ordering? I can't see how \"as spicy as you can possibly make it\" could be interpreted as mild. Does my group have a higher standard of \"spicy\"? I don't personally think I do, I often order medium spice at restaurants and find my mouth pleasantly ablaze. Maybe they were just having an off night, and if we went there again, things would be spicier? But there's no shortage of other restaurants in St Pete, and second chances don't come easily.\n\nThe food was tasty, the service was good, I was never at a loss for water, but as a man who likes spicy food, there are plenty of other options.",

After pulling into the parking lot with hardly any cars and then I asked to be upgraded because it seems as though the hotel is pretty empty they try to charge me $10 to do that rather than just giving me a little bit better of a room.

  "text": "This is hands down the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I got my vision checked there for glasses and contacts. I elected for a photo instead of getting dilated by drops and never received an email with the photo record, this after asking on three separate occasions. I choose and purchased the glasses I wanted and that was that. I went to the store a few months later to order contacts. I had the rudest person wait on me. There was one other customer in the store so it was not busy, one employee was working with the other customer and the other one is free. She seems to be in the middle of paper work so she says I'll be with you in a moment. No problem, my friend and I proceeded to look at sunglasses frames. When she is ready for me she motions for me to sit down, I do so and ask to order contacts. She looks up my information and in the nastiest tone for no reason at all tells me I have to buy two different boxes because your eyes are different. I know I reply, and she rudely retorts \" well I'm just telling you.\" I didn't deserve this attitude and I had half the mind to walk out the store and just buy them online, oh how I wish I had. Look I have terrible vision, and have for 27yrs of my life. I know even with insurance this is going to be costly. My glasses were close to $300 and just a 3 month supply for contacts was $180. I elected to pay more for a picture of my eye because I value my eye health. So the least thing you might expect out of a store you bring eye insurance to and have spent over $500 on-top off insurance is that the store will at least be open during the posted hours of business and treat you with common customer service and decency. I arrived at 5:28pm to pickup the contacts, surprise... door locked. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that same rude employee walking down the street a few blocks before I got to the store. There were still employees inside and they just looked at me like I was crazy when I pulled the door to try to open it. Believe the other reviewers, don't waste your time here. There are so many other choices in places to buy glasses and contacts and they certainly don't care about their customers.",

She was very snooty in tone and talked down to me . I am of Malaysian descent and have a Master's degree. I didn't appreciate being talked down to. She said I could sit outside, at the bar or at the high top. I agreed to the high top. When my husband came in, he observed that patrons who were casually dressed were seated in my section. Less than a quarter of the tables in the other section were occupied - he went to the restroom to wash his hands and saw this. My husband ordered a Sushi plate while I ordered the Singapore Grouper. His sushi was fine, but he didn't want wasabi on his plate and there was wasabi on his plate. He was annoyed. My Singapore grouper was disgusting - naming it a Singapore food is embarrassing. It was served with a sweet sauce and had absolutely no flavor. This is not sweet sour fish. The menu didn't describe that dish having a sauce- so deceptive. The server was ok. However, I asked for a spicy sauce and he recommended sriracha, but brought a horrible spicy sauce which he said was served with edamame. My husband then asked for the sriracha again and he brought it. What a totally disappointing dinner!! No more Wild Ginger for me.",

I must say that over the many years dining at this particular restaurant, the food has gone downhill. I ordered mamas trio and the food came out cold! Not just sitting in the window warmed ready to be taken the table, but cold out of the frig. I had our server touch the fettuccini with his finger to verify and he concurred that the noodles were refrigerator cold. He then took my plate and must have placed it in he oven and yes it came back hot, but the bottom of the lasagne was burnt and stuck to the plate, I couldn't scrape it off to eat it. Not to mention that he price of $19 was way too much for the small portions without a salad. We were one of only four tables in the restaurant and not once did my tea get refilled. My husbands tea sat empty at the edge of the table for quite some time and was refilled as we were paying our bill. My husband had the chicken scallopini--the exact same item he has had for years and obviously the recipe has changed...for the worse. There was no sear in the chicken, it tasted boiled. The cheeses for the first time tasted like velveeta, not the original butter and cream recipe.  The kids each had spaghetti and meatballs and no thank you, we don't want to mix those leftovers to take home. And just like last time, the bread was dry and tasted like it was old, not fresh out of the oven like we used to get.  Not once did our server come back and ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. Sad to say, but you lost our business.",

  "text": "On 19 February 2018 I entered into a contract with ASC Moving to move the belongings in my home from Newark, DE to Wilmington, DE, a total of approximately 12 Miles. The contract called for ASC Moving to pack said belongings on Tuesday, 2/27/18 and move them on Wednesday, 2/28/18. I was quoted an estimate and I paid a deposit.\n\nEven though I paid for packing, I found that many things had still not been packed. The ASC staff completed their \"shift\" at 4:00pm and left, even though the job was not completed. I had to pack many things myself.\n\nBecause of the amount of content to be moved, the move would take place using two trucks, and four men. ASC Charges per hour per man, plus a truck fee. Because they don't have big 53' trucks, they would send 2 trucks, but I'd only pay for 1. \n\nMove day (2/28/18): 3 movers arrived at the Newark home with one small truck. They said the driver of the larger truck had an accident and was hospitalized. I'm sorry that happened, but don't they have a backup? They also said that, because they have only the small truck, the move would be completed in two trips. WTF?\n\nI immediately phoned the ASC office and, after conversation expressing my frustration, received affirmation from Andres Santa, the owner, that the \"clock would stop\" once the truck was unloaded at the Wilmington home the first time. This really should have been the point at which I canceled the move with ASC and rescheduled with a different company, in spite of the expenses that I would have to incur. \n\nSurprisingly, they damaged only one piece of furniture (a bookshelf). The shelf was so badly damaged it made no sense to have it moved. Some of the \"kitchen\" boxes did not have appropriate padding and it was amazing that some of the glass items (mason jars, in particular) did not break.\n\nThe first load took 8 hours and 15 minutes from start to finish\n\nDuring the round two packing, one of the crew members asked if the clothes in the closet were going (yes, he really did ask me that question), he told me that they had no garment boxes and wanted to know if I had some garbage bags through which they could stick the hangers and move the clothes that way. I supplied the garbage bags. \nI wondered why they didn't have (or use) a dolly or why they didn't have a ramp to move heavier items up the steps - all the things I have seen happen in the many, many moves I have experienced before (but all with national moving companies). Then they realized they would still need a third trip, and that would happen on 3/1/18. I had no choice; items couldn't fit on the truck.\n\nHighlights of the move include:\n- the dining room table top was moved, but the base wasn't moved at the same time.\n- They didn't bring my clothes, shoes, etc in the 1st or 2nd round, so I had no clean clothes until next day\n- All the paintings and mirrors and those types of fragile items were not properly wrapped. I had to be explicit about how to care for these items.\n- Some bookcases were moved to the new home but the shelves for the cases were not moved in the same run, so made unpacking difficult.\n- They left trash (plastic bags from clothes and also from mattress cover in the new home; I guess I have to trash them\n- When I emailed the owner about the damage to my property, he said it could be fixed with some wood glue\n- Owner, Andres Santa, offered no compensation for my having to pay another month's rent at my old place because they had to complete the move on 3/1, when I needed to be out of the old house on 2/28.\n\nI know this is a long message. And it only begins to capture the unprofessionalism and what I would also characterize as incompetence of this moving company, ASC Moving. This company was referred to me by a trusted colleague. I can say with certainty that no-one will get a referral to ASC from me.",

I think they genuinely didn't care for us which is upsetting since we paid almost 400 bucks for our meal. Took FORVER to get our food. Apps came out quick but entrees took over 45 minutes to come out. Same with dessert. I felt incredibly disrespected they should retrain their staff on etiquette. Manager came over and comped two desserts but It wasn't enough to make me wanna come back ever. They place blows \n\nApps:\nPhilly nachos - the only thing that was good. Good sauce, meat was cooked well, nachos were different but good \n\nLobster mac n cheese - average. Greasy \n\nSteak tataki - terrible. Too salty \n\nCreamy spinach - decent. Probably good with a steak \n\nDinner:\nVeal shank - 4 small pieces of veal and a weird crunchy croquet of sorts. Veal was good but expect more portion for 35 bucks. \n\nFilet and short rib - looked ok. Didn't taste but friend said it was average \n\nSalmon - buddy said this was actually good \n\nDessert:\nWarm Vanilla cake - awful. No gooey center. Lacked flavor \n\nPhilly special - an embarrassment to Philadelphia. Remove or redo this dessert. This is a city of champions and if you're going to pay homage to the Super Bowl you better come correct. \n\nTacky interior, view is not what you'd expect. If you wanna come for happy hour might be worth it to see what the hype is about but that's about it. \n\nEpic fail",

The price was good and I was happy, although they always seemed to leave some cleaning tool or supply behind..  However, over Christmas break I noticed all my gold jewelry gone.  The only people who had been in my house over Christmas was the Cleaning Authority.

I immediately cancelled the service and filed a police report.  I am devastated as all my gold jewelry came from my late mother and grandmother.  They even took my high school ring and daughter's baptism necklace.  I still tear up as I think about my mother's ring that I wore everyday but just happen to take it off over Christmas to wear a new ring my husband had given me.

When I got home I called to speak with Mr. An and he wasn't there.\nI talked to the manager and old him what happened and figured I would get a call from the owner but no one ever called. The waitress kept forgetting things. She charged us for a split plate for a 1 year and a 2 year old who didn't eat anything. She said she was going to bring food for them but never did. She also said if she didn't charge that for the kids she would get in trouble.They just charged us for it anyway. The cook was slinging spices at the children. What was that for? We had filet and it was just small chunks filled with grissel and fat. The shrimp were very tough.\nThey also charged us 18% tip. We always leave at least 20% but would not have done that that night.\nThere were only 5 adults eating. Not supposed to charge a pre-determined tip unless there are at least 6 or more. That is what the manager told me unless there is 6 or more people eating. There were 2 little ones that did not eat. The bill was just a little under $300 with a $48 dollar tip.\nWe have eaten there 3 or 4 times a year for several years but that was the last time. We will never go back there again.",

It's a huge misleading bate and switch game all the way through. We were told we had an appointment by a young lady. When we were arrived we were switched to a different sales person by the sales manager. We were told on the phone that we were approved for 13 percent of our income. When we sat down at a table we were told that they needed to run credit. Again it was a bait and switch. We looked at cars and found one we liked. We were then told that a new one was the best option due to rebates. Again a bait and switch. We were looking at Kia sol with a budget of $13k to $17k. The new Kia had a sticker of $18k. When we sat down at the table again they played games with a $3000 add on package including pin stripes, nitrogen in the tires, etc. Every used Kia in the world has these features on it. Again a bait and switch as we requested a car without the upgrade package and out of the hundred of cars they could not produce a single car with out it. Then came dealer fees and many more charges. The basic 2018 Kia with cloth seats and no frills was now over $25000.00 dollars. Again a bait and switch on the price....but it came with a cruise. Do they really think we want a vacation when we are there to buy a car? Talk about a conflict of interest. Think how much the cruise costs financed in with the car over the next 4 or 5 or 6 years.  When you walk in the door and see all those red shirts and closing tables...run. We were there for almost 5 hours before we completely realized that the whole place was a box full of snakes. We simply walked away and an hour later the sales person sent a text saying he would meet us at the table as he was away from the table for long periods of time and did not realize we had left.  Please, please, please go somewhere else or you may end up in a car payment for the rest of your life because the car will not be worth what you paid for it.",

  "text": "Literally sitting in my car crying right now. Ugliest nails I have ever gotten in my entire life. This place is OK if you have natural and short nails or just want a color. Not for stiletto nails, gel nails, long nails, or acrylics. DO NOT COME HERE FOR TRENDY NAILS!!!!!!!! I love getting my nails done, I've been getting them done for the past few years. It's something that is really important to me... right now I feel like somebody shaved my head bald. I am going home and taking off these nails as soon as possible. On top of that, I start a new job on Wednesday and wanted to make a good impression.... now I will either have to come up with another $55 or show up to my orientation with bare, ugly nails.  \n\nI waited over 30 minutes after being told I would only wait 10. He said he couldn't get the shape I wanted, that it was \"impossible\". When obviously I know it's not impossible, I've been getting my nails this shape and length for years. Saying that I would \"poke my eye out\" ... I asked if I could just do the coffin shape instead, then he told me he would have to charge me extra for that. So you can't do the shape I want, so you're going to charge me extra to make up for your lack of skill? next they were out of the color I wanted to use, next to the color I picked wasn't dark enough to cover the sparkle gel I had underneath. So I went with my third choice, the nail polish went on extra thick and ugly. He knew that my nails looked ugly, because he made me pay before he painted. No one else had to do that while I was there. He was trying to tell me about how he couldn't make the sparkle gel go away, when I know that's also not true because I go between using sparkle gel and regular gel for my manicures all the time. So basically they are money hungry liars who suck at their job. I cannot emphasize enough that I have never received nails this ugly. Plus he was rushing, he completed my fill in under 30 minutes... Usually it takes my nail tech over an hour. WORST PLACE EVER !!!!!!! I wasn't even able to get a refund, instead I got a gift certificate. I don't want a gift certificate, you can trust me I am never coming back.",

  "text": "I just purchased an appliance from Lowe's online web site.  I made the purchase but nowhere on that page did it ask if I wanted installation.  It only assumes pick-up.  I then went to the installations page, filled out the questionnaire (for a call back).  When someone called me back I was informed I have to go into the store to purchase the installation (could not be done online)!  I did that.  I got the call from the installation vendor and scheduled my install.  The day of my install the vendor went to pick it up but there was an issue.  I got a call from Lowe's Installation dept. saying they needed my credit card again.  WHAT? They had cancelled my original online order (because it was \"online\") it was not the correct \"process\". They rentered my original sale. I rescheduled with the vendor and did get my installation. The reason I ordered online was the day I was in the store ready to purchase there was only 1 associate there and about 8 customers in the area, I waited an hour, left, then ordered online. This review is to let you know if you plan to purchase an appliance for installation, do not order online.  The whole process took about 1 month from the day I purchased to installation day.",

  "text": "Wow where did all these great reviews come from? They must be friends or relatives because our visit was incredibly unsatisfying. \nService was so bad, like inadequate. \nWe went on a Sunday afternoon and several large parties were finishing up and leaving. Perhaps that had something to do with it?\nIf it wasn't for the bus boy I don't think we ever would've been taken care of. \nFood was very overpriced for what it was, and I had a bite of my husbands rice, loobia polo (sautéed green beans, mushrooms and peas with tomato sauce) and the bite I had to spit out!  It tasted spoiled! Like sour and not from the seasoning. \nI had a veggie kebab 14.95 that consisted of two old (as in leftovers ) sad, cold potatoes on the end. The marinade - seasoning was slathered on thickly, so much so that it didn't melt or cook into the veggies which were mostly onions with a tomato, a few pieces of zucchini, a quartered mushroom and a slice of red bell pepper.  My rice, adas polo, (raisins, lentils, dates and saffron in basmati) was good though.  But not $45 good! \nWe shared an interesting appetizer called tah dig which was a crispy rice cake served with a vegetable mixture over it for 11.95. The menu made it sound so good and intriguing but it was very disappointing. Just kinda bland and not fresh. \nThe helpful bus boy brought us the house made bread ( also good) with a plate that had cilantro leaves, wrapped cold butter pats  and a hunk of onion on it. (?) I love cilantro so I ate it but it was weird. \nDo not recommend.",

Then I heard a bunch of yelling and arguing at the end of the aisle---a customer and an employee were arguing with one another about the employee following the customer around--I guess the customer felt as though she was keeping an eye on her to make sure she would not shoplift?  Then when the customer left, all of the employees started getting fired up about it.  The one employee yelled \"I was just trying to eat my chips!\"  It was so uncomfortable.  Then as I was looking at lipsticks an employee yelled over to me that I was not allowed to try any of them out.  Then as I was about to make a return for a product and had my receipt (which by the way you can only receive store credit for returns--which okay fine) but said they could not return it because it looked used (it wasn't).  The prices arent good either.  Better off going to Ulta folks.  You wont get yelled at and you can make returns :)",

  "text": "For lack of better words, this place is a complete shit show. I have never dined at the restaurant, but the bar/ nightclub is the most disorganized, poorly managed cluster fuck that I've ever seen. My friend and I were looking forward to a fun ladies night out -- not so much. There was a line about a mile long to get in to the club, but we waited patiently. After almost 30 minutes in line, one of the staff members told a large group of us at the back of the line to follow him to another entrance outside. We did so, and we weren't even halfway there when a tall, African American bouncer started yelling at us to go to the back of the line. When myself and several others told him we were just there, he said he didn't care, and he forced us to the back of the line. On the way back, we ran into the employee who told us to follow him, and I explained that we were sent back. He apologized and told us to we could go ahead in the door. At that point, another bouncer yelled at him and at all of us customers, and forced us to the back of the line yet again. At this point, my friend and I were ready to leave. We were appalled by the way the staff were yelling at each other, and yelling at us, the customers, even though we were just doing as we were told. At this point, I decided I wanted to speak with a manager, simply to report what was happening outside of the club. A few minutes later the same, tall African American bouncer who had just yelled at all of us to go back to the end of the line, approaches me and says he's a manager. I questioned him about being a manager since he had so rudely just yelled at a huge group of us to go back to the end of the line. Then this bouncer told me that he was not only a manager, but he was the owner. Um, no I don't think so. This man looked like he was the leader of a gang, and he was shaky and fired up with adrenaline like he had been using cocaine. A quick Google search later revealed that the owners of American Social are Rick Mijares and Paul Greenberg. I attempted to explain to him the situation at hand and the chaos that was happening around us with people screaming, cursing and pushing one another. But how do you explain that to someone who is a part of the problem and is lying about being both a manager and an owner of the establishment? This is the case of someone on a power trip, and most likely high on drugs, who thinks that he has the right to say and do anything he wants. I kept trying to talk to him, but he couldn't even stand still for 2 seconds to listen to me. He kept cutting me off and saying that I needed to hurry up and that he didn't have time to talk to me and that he needed to go. I asked him politely to please slow down and let me speak. He continued to interrupt me, he wasn't listening to me, and he never maintained eye contact. I realized that there was no talking to this man who couldn't even stand still. At that point, I said forget it. I believe my words were, \"This place is a shit show, and I won't be back.\" This bouncer claimed later to the police that I touched him? I am a petite Caucasian woman who is only 5'1\" and I have NEVER been in physical fight in my entire life. If I did \"touch him,\" it must have been very fast and in an expression of anger and frustration, because I said I was leaving and walked out the door. The bouncer then grabbed me by both of my wrists and would not let me go. No one has ever grabbed me like that in my entire life. He squeezed my wrists so hard that I couldn't move at all. Today I have swelling, bruises, redness and marks on both my forearms and wrists from where he was holding me. He then marched me outside of the club and paraded me around to the crowd like I was a prize. I screamed for him to stop, but he wouldn't. I kept screaming, \"please let go of me, you're hurting me,\" but he wouldn't let go. I was scared like I've never been scared in my entire life. I didn't know what to do. At this point I went into \"fight or flight\" mode and my wrists were burning like fire. I could barely move my body because he had me pinned so hard, but I tried to kick him in the legs and in the nuts so that he would loosen his grip from me.\" Let's not forget that I was 100% sober and had not even set foot in the club. He then paraded me around back inside and called the cops over. The cops had to tell him multiple times to let me go. I knew then and there that I had been assaulted. I gave my statement to 2 policemen, but they did not fill out any type of incident report. They also took a statement from the bouncer. I was shaking and crying and my wrists were on fire. The cops said that it was his word against mine and they didn't even offer to look at the security footage. The police told me that the witnesses both inside and outside of the venue did not matter. They also said that my friend who was with me was not a witness. I was then told that if I ever stepped foot in American Social again that I would be arrested.",

My and my partner's wings were overcooked to the point that we could not eat them. They were hard and the meat was dry, it also had no seasoning. The rice was very good and fresh as well as the fries. The chicken Philly was decent but nothing set it apart, I've had a better Philly at Jersey Mike's. I was most disappointed with the wings, you don't serve what you wouldn't eat.",

Now let's run back the facts, girl stopped at our table possibly 4 times including getting our order and bringing the checks. We waited over an hour for hard tough cold food repeatedly claiming our food wasn't done, although it came cold? Words of advice hunny - better service equals better tips. Do your job thanks. Very petite blonde girl I'd avoid at all costs. Her comments made me very happy that i didn't leave a bigger tip myself.",

  "text": "Ok, I guess my go to place was having a bad night with their service staff. Upon arrival, 7:20pm on a Friday night, we were presented two options: 1st - to sit in the dining room, without reservations, $20 or 2nd - be seated on the rooftop for $10. Basically, the main dining room had UGO and the rooftop was having a Caribbean affair. Due the lack of space we opted for the rooftop, WRONG. After climbing the stairs, we were greeted by a young woman who said that there was a $15 cover. Forget going back and forth about the stated $10 cover.  A server came by, took our drink/food orders and left. That was almost the last time we saw her. Someone else brought the food and drinks. The Caribbean affair tuned out to be large overwhelming speakers.  We couldn't hear ourselves talk. No one was dancing so it's not clear why the volume was so high. After eating, we waited for about 25 minutes before just going to the bar, where our server was multitasking, and asking for a check. No one returned to check to see if we needed anything and for napkins, we grabbed someone else walking by.\n\nI'm disappointed but if I can convince my SO, we'll go back. This was a first and like I said, they could have been having a bad night.",

This past week we had another special occasion and decided to eat at Duling-Kurtz.  We were very disappointed.  The meal was mediocre to say the least.  The French onion soup was very good, dinner rolls w/lemon curd very good.  The meal went downhill from there.   The salad was nondescript.  No shaved cheese or anchovy filet  in the presentation .  We had the house specialty lobster crepe.  The crepe and the lobster filling was dry and the vegetables were over cooked.  We did not have dessert.  Regarding the atmosphere in the room that we ate, the interior needed a do over and seemed to not have been painted since we were last there 30 yrs ago.  We were not rushed through the meal but the waitress that we had was inattentive.  Finally, the meal was extremely expensive.  I don't mind paying for an extraordinary meal, but this meal was one step above diner food.  This will be the last time that we dine there.  So disappointed.",

You also may not be, but here it is anyway... \n\nThe food/coffee here is average and what you would expect from any DD location. The problem here is the service, as well as the employees. Not only are they all miserable, they are incredibly rude. They are also impatient. Yesterday I went into the store and placed my order. For some reason I was logged out of my DD app and needed to log back in. There were two people behind me in line, but they had another register. The cashier cancelled my order and made me stand off to the side while she and another cashier took the orders of the two men on both registers. I then had to reorder everything  she said she remembered the order, typed it in and I paid. Of course the order was completely wrong when I received it. When I told the people who made the order that it was wrong the owner came over and confirmed what I wanted, then remade it. It was still wrong when we got in the car! \n\nThe owner of this location has been rude to either me or other customers every time I've been in this store. He's also horrible to his employees and talks down to them every chance he gets. Needless to say, I will not be going back into this store. You should avoid it too.",

Extremely old but you could deal with that if the room was at least clean which it was NOT. Upon entering the room we noticed the small table in the kitchenette area had not been wiped down then there was gum stuck to the carpet which was pretty freshly there as it was still sticky once settled in we showered and when I grabbed a clean towel to dry off I noticed stains on the towel. We didn't say anything at first the next day after being out at the beach went back to room around 4pm to notice room still hadn't been cleaned yet and we had no fresh towels to shower with. We went to the phone in the room to call down to front desk to ask when room would be cleaned and could not get a dial tone pulled the little night stand out to see why (well first there was old food behind the nightstand never cleaned) and then noticed the phone wire had been cut and there was no way to contact the front desk. We then went down to tell them at the front desk how room is not cleaned yet and we had no phone service cause wire was cut and there was food behind the night stand and was told they would have maintenance come fix it which never happened  they did finally come to clean the room and once again never wiped down the table or counter tops that were dirty and sticky.

This place is tiny and cramped as ever! My family and I prepaid for our passes but still had to wait on a long line before the water section entry for wrist bans. \n\nOnce you get inside the water entry, it's pure chaos. You have no choice but to put your stuff in lockers that cost $10-$15 each! We had 7 people with us so we had to buy two. Staff here is horrible! There was no one telling us where to even buy the wristbands for the lockers. Turns out you need a special bracelet just for that. The locker area was ridiculous! Super cramped, people pushing and shoving trying to get through, it was just a nightmare. \n\nOnce you get your locker be prepared to wait again in a small crowded space for a changing room. These rooms were dirty and unkept, I was not impressed. \n\nThe place itself is super tiny, I honestly expected a much larger facility based on the website and Youtube vids I saw. They have about 6 attractions in total, I am not kidding. The best attractions were the lazy river and the big tube slides. Everything else even for the kids was just meh. \n\nThe fact that adults can drink here bothers me. I don't think alcohol, adults and kids should mix but apparently it's whatever goes at Sahara Sams. The overall experience of an indoor water park was cool but I would not return. This place is a rip off completely. And good thing we didnt buy food here like our friend did, she spent $74 on 4 items!! Save your money and go elsewhere.",

Last week, no baked potatoes & the place is empty.\nThere are at least 5 people \"working\", yet there is no food ready.\nThere were 2 cars ahead of me in the drive thru. The first car tried 3 variations of orders before 1 was acceptable. The man in front of me wanted a salad, that one I understand, no one has romaine. Then he ordered chicken fingers & they had to cook them & it would take 8 minutes.\nThere were no customers. in the store & 2 people in the vehicle ahead of me. The girl on the intercom left me sitting for 10 minutes & forgot I was there.\nI finally pulled up to place my order & there was no chicken cooked & I'd have to wait 6-8 minutes. This chick went ballistic on me! I was the rudest customer & it did not stop. She went on the entire time I waited griping & complaining about me. The guy at the checkout gave me a soda for my wait. I addressessed my displeasure with the verbal bashing I was having to listen to.\nI called corporate while waiting & spoke to someone who genuinely seemed concerned.\nWhat's a girl to do? I did not eat my food, I was afraid of what may have been done to it & I will never return to any Wendy's again.",

  "text": "I'm in town for work and wanted to check out the new food hall to see what options I had for lunch. I saw this poke spot and figured I'd give it a try since I had a hankering for poke. \n\nI haven't written a review in a while, but I felt compelled to warn people about this spot. The food itself was mediocre, a solid 3/5 stars. Nothing special about this poke spot whatsoever. What knocks the score down 1 more star is that it is so expensive!! You're going to spend a minimum of $11 unless you just want rice, greens, and toppings without any proteins-which would still put you out $7 for a small. They put a ton of rice to make it seem full, and skimp on the salad.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that they don't allow any substitutions in their signature bowls. I was totally fine with that since I wanted the Spicy Salmon bowl. As they started working on my food, they told me \"Oops! We ran out of salmon\" so I asked them if they could give me the same bowl but just substitute the fish for the tuna. They informed me I would have to change it into a \"make it your own\" style bowl then because no substitutions allowed, remember? I asked if it would turn out to be the same price because, after all, it was not my fault they ran out of salmon. She assured me it would be the same price so I proceeded with my order. At checkout I ended up paying $2 more than the Spicy Salmon bowl price, and with a protein that I didn't even want to begin with.\n\nI regretted choosing this place for lunch today and won't be returning. If you do give this spot a try, just be forewarned that they will not budge on their \"policies\" even if they run out of an ingredient. And know that you're overpaying for a mediocre product.",

Avoid! \n\nTo give some background, the current management previously owned a Chinese restaurant called Chinese Dumpling House. It earned a terrible reputation among Chinese customers, so the owner changed locations to its current location and opened H2O Lounge as well, two establishments sharing one space.\n \nWe decided to try the Dumpling House, wanting to see if the food got better after switching locations. First thing we noticed when we entered was the appalling hygiene, none of the tables were wiped, and there was even leftover food on them! The food we ordered was frozen, seemingly made a long time ago. Had very little meat in the dishes and a LOT of msg in it. Very disappointing.",

I first called on 9/12 & their Customer Service said I would get disposition on the order by the end of business that day. Called as she indicated to FU - she was rude and then they just sent me a standard email with a link to the supposed USPS tracking.  That tracking said only that a shipping label to me had been created, but no product had been received from HOB (ie that it was only a pre-ship order). I called HOB twice more and sent an email requesting a credit to my credit card, since the USPS still did not have the product from them.  Got more run-around and rude phone behavior.  Finally on 9/20, called to ask where item was (told inaccurately that the shipping manager looked into it and that the postal service had the item but hadn't shipped it - patently false-- USPS tracking label still showed no item received from HOB). Cust. Service would not let me talk to a manager, claimed a refund 'would be pending'; but when I expressed impatience at all of this, wanting still to speak to a manager, the woman hung up.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS NIGHTMARE PLACE.  I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (told the rep I was going to do this...she said 'go ahead') regarding shady online consumer retailers.  My order was small, but I hate to think of those who might have a heftier order.  Avoid this hassle altogether - DO NOT ORDER FROM HOUSE OF BEAUTY.",

Our server bought us out really warm water which is ok I guess, but took literally forever when we asked for ice and our water glasses stayed empty pretty much the whole night. As a server myself, I understand being busy but it's just like all the other servers around us didn't bother to work outside of their section even a little bit to make sure everyone was ok, not just their own tables. Our server was very friendly, but I think he had a little too much on his plate that night. The person who ran us our food was very rude to us, but our food came out quickly and was so good.

And half the time they had tables for 4 being given to 2, so the whole place was under-utilised despite having a line to get in.

The box was taped; when I got it home and opened it the quiche was a mess.  This is the condition while still wrapped in their plastic wrap.  The crust was not even in the wrapper; 1/2 of it was just gone.  The owner was apologetic and gave me my money back but I'm stuck with this horrid looking quiche to serve my guests this morning.  He admitted that it was pure laziness on the part of his staff.  I ordered this a week in advance of my event.  The woman who took my order was rude but I was willing to let that go.  I should have known then.  This is truly a disappointment.",

If something you've consigned is under $8 or $9 and doesn't sell you won't get it back. The lack of customer service is the bigger problem. Just be friendly and helpful. Most of the employees there seem annoyed to be working and are not friendly. They do have loud conversations with one another. You can shop there but don't expect a great experience.",

  "text": "I was highly disappointed in my experience here. First off they don't take reservations, we had to \"call ahead.\" We arrived and were seated right away. We ordered our beverages which came at a timely manner. But some of the mugs were dirty. We received new ones. Then we ordered avocado toast as our appetizers (one plain, one with eggs). They were both very delicious and came out after our drinks were served. We asked for side plates so we could share. Every plate was dirty. We asked for new ones because they were all dirty (food residue) and the waitress looked at us like we were insane. We ordered our breakfast and it took almost 45 minutes. Our waiter who was very nice brought out chips and salsa for us. We did not want chips and salsa we wanted our food. We kept wondering why he brought us this. We figured it was because the food was taking so long. Then finally our food arrived. Well here comes another problem. I ordered the lemon blueberry pancakes. They were just blueberry pancakes (which I don't like). It had no lemon and nothing else that the menu described (I would have ordered something else). Then the other orders were completely wrong. One person ordered no mushrooms in their eggs and as it was being placed on the table you could see it was chock full of mushrooms (had to be taken back) and the other asked for no potatoes. There were potatoes on the plate. And she asked for other things to be included and they weren't. Both had to be remade. The manager came over and apologized and took both meals off the check. We were a little worried because one person at the table special ordered her meal and the waiter wasn't writing anything down, so we though he might get it wrong. My biggest problem with this is that people have food allergies and if they eat something they asked to be replaced they could get sick. I wish they would be more careful. They gave us a gift card to come back (I don't live near there so I gave it to a friend). I was very disappointed. I will not be returning or recommending to anyone. I gave 2 stars because the food was good. Everything else gets 1 star.",

We have never experienced such a requirement and would have have been stuck if we needed to get in for a sick visit. During the wellness visit, they offered an optional eye exam (machine) at an additional cost of $79 if insurance did not cover it. We declined and ended up with no eye check. A normal eye exam includes an eye chart, and they did not have any after their upgrade. Federal guidelines for wellness visits include an eye exam, so the fact that it did not come with the co-pay is reason to not return due to their business practices. The office staff was unconcerned with my request for a standard eye exam because we would not be billed and thought school would cover the gap.",

  "text": "My fiance and I dined at the Germantown location this past Monday, at approximately 5:30pm. We were seated immediately, as there was no wait. After 10 minutes, my fiance walked to the bar to ask for some water. No one had been to our table. When a waitress finally came over, she said \"sorry I have the whole section\". We ordered a side salad, cheese sticks and a deep dish pizza. We dine there frequently so we knew it would be a 45 min wait for the pizza which was why we ordered apps and salad. After 45 minutes, we did not have our apps so we asked about them. About 5-7 minutes later they were finally delivered. An hour after THAT we still did not have our pizza, and we had watched the table beside us turn twice (one family was seated there when we arrived. They finished, paid, left, another family of 5 came in, ordered 3 pizzas, ate and left, and still we had no pizza). We brought this to the waitress's attention. She said \"We have a new chef, so he is still learning the ropes\" OK, but he managed to get their pizzas to them.... Eventually the manager on duty came over and offered to get a round of drinks. My fiance ordered a beer, but having a headache, I just wanted more water, and to get my food and go home. After almost 2 hrs our pizza came, and the manager (after we asked what she was going to do to fix the situation) gave us a coupon for a pizza for our NEXT visit. As someone who also works in the service industry, I know how it is...but I also know we are taught to make the situation right. While I appreciate the free pizza for our next visit, we were still charged for our entire meal THIS time, which was the time we experienced an issue. I told the manager, 312 is our favorite spot, we come there frequently, and have never had a problem. It would not deter us from coming back, but I left very frustrated that our entire meal THAT NIGHT was not comped. I still do not understand why we had to pay for something we waited 2 hrs for.  I just think a little more of an apology and better customer service by the wait staff would have been good",

The only difference was the spice level, the noodle size, and the addition of beef chunks instead of just beef slices. \n\nI had to add a bunch of salt, fish sauce, sriracha, etc just to make the soup flavorful. It tastes a bit like lemongrass water honestly. The noodles were super thick, chalky but mushy at the same time. \n\nI had an incident with my food that I won't speak of, considering that I understand things happen at restaurants. However, it caused me to return my bowl of soup when I hadn't even finished a third of it. The owner came out and basically told me in the nicest way possible that it was no big deal and that they could just make me another soup. I lost my appetite and declined politely. \n\nWhen they came out with the bill, I saw that they didn't remove the soup that I had barely finished. They didn't offer me another meal. They didn't offer a discount. They just acted as if the issue I brought to their attention was no big deal. In my mind, that's not good service. There's too many Pho places in the Tampa Bay Area to deal with mediocre food and lack of responsibility for mistakes when preparing food.\n\nThe two stars are because the soup wasn't terrible once I added all of the seasoning and the decor inside is pretty nice.",

It's the closest place to eat from my work so I stop by when I don't feel like making a lunch, several times I've been standing at the counter waiting for someone to take my order, they see me standing there but continue their own personal conversations. Today while waiting in line, 4 other people were ahead of me, they had 1 register open, an employee came up, did something on the second register, looked at all of us in line and just walked away to do anything other than take orders. If this location had better service, I'd give it more stars but I can't bring myself to to give them anything more than 2 stars.",

  "text": "Talk about disappointing. Ordered at 4:15 PM on Sunday as we drove back from Ohio. I told the waitress I was on I-70 but expected to be at the 86th Street location around 5:15 PM. She said that she would wait to put my order in so that it would be ready when I arrived. Got there at 5:10 PM and my order (3 dinners of full slabs of baby back ribs with sides of macaroni/cheese and broccoli with each) was waiting at the bar (that should have been my first clue). Got home, the food was cold (it's about a 10 minute ride from the restaurant) and the meat was tough and dry (Squealers used to be dependable - fall off the bone and tender). The sides are about the size of three forks full - not worth the $24 per meal charged; even gave a tip based on past experience, which was definitely a mistake. Definitely will be looking for a better BBQ restaurant; any suggestions?",

The small portions were poorly executed and my Chicken Cacciatore lacked the usual and promised peppers and mushrooms, while the 'Baked Ziti' consisted of penne pasta in flavorless red sauce with some Riccotta, obviously not baked nor topped with cheese.\n\nWhile this restaurant was by no means expensive, it wasn't worth the price we did pay.",

I have been in touch with my friends at NBC 10 (trouble shooters) and the Philadelphia Inquirer. They are willing to interview me so I can tell everyone about my experience. I am planning on meeting with both of these news forums this Friday.\nI have received well over a hundred replies from my family and friends stating they will no longer give this establishment their business.

  "text": "On Saturday, September 22, we took our Golden Retriever to the Veterinary Specialty Center located at 4909 N La Canada Dr. Tucson, AZ. As she had abdominal swelling (Ascitis ) from a possible liver condition,  my veterinarian suggested that fluid be drained to provide some relief from her discomfort.  As this facility was highly respected we were sent there for the procedure along with forwarded charts and information provided prior to our arrival. \n\nAs treatment is provided 24 hours per day in the emergency department an appointment was not required. Upon our arrival the reception had no idea of any prior notification from our veterinarian.  I spoke with a technician who also had no idea of what should be done. After some investigation they learned that yes there were charts that had been forwarded and I was taken to an exam room. The technician said the doctor would like to take a look at my dog to evaluate her. She was returned to me and I was told that the doctor felt she was not in a critical state and could wait until a biopsy was scheduled on her liver. At no time was I able to have direct contact with the doctor.\n\nI scheduled an appointment for the biopsy but upon returning home I had many questions that I needed answered before committing to the surgery. The following morning I called and again spoke to receptionist requesting a quick consultation with the doctor when she could fit me in and that I would wait on the phone. I was told that I would learn all about the procedure on the day of the surgery. I said that was not satisfactory. I wished to speak directly to the doctor now. I was put on hold for 20 minutes or more at which time the receptionist came back on the line and asked me what I needed. I explained that I had been waiting for 20 minutes for a quick minute with the doctor. I was told that she was too busy to speak with me and again told me that my questions would be answered by the doctor the day of the surgery. I then cancelled the surgery appointment and clearly expressed that my dog was too important to me to be treated in an uncaring, impersonal,  unorganized and obviously inadequate facility such as theirs. \n\nThis center is nothing but a money mill for desperate pet lovers and I strongly suggest you consider other options for your family companions. \n\nDr. E S Nielsen M.D.\n(dbnr)",

  "text": "This place is a complete scam.  I went here because my mechanic said it was ok.  It's not and now I am suspect of their judgement.\n\nFirst, I called to see how much they would charge to put tires on my car.  I got a price.  However, he spent 15 minutes trying to talk me into his house tires (which I'm sure that he gets a large portion of the sale).  Uneasy since he seemed slimy over the phone, I thought \"How hard is it to install tires.  I'm sure that's all they do so they'll do a good job.\"  So, I came in, brought my own tires and asked them to install it.  \nThen, he ends up charging me 33% more for tire install/balance than what was quoted on the phone.\n\nThey also found something wrong with a tire pressure sensor (although it had been working up until that point).  He said he could replace it for $100, which he proclaimed \"I won't charge for labor since we already have the tires off\".  I quickly looked up that this part was $50 on the internet.  But I thought... ok, he's there .. and to get this done on its own might cost as much.  So I foolishly agreed.  Then, when the guy gave me the car, the tire-flat sensor was still on!!!  I called my husband and he said that it might need to be reset -- so I didn't pursue it with them.  But how can you fix a sensor and then still give it back to the customer while mumbling \"one of the other sensors was giving a weird reading\".  P.S. my mechanic says that they replaced the sensor with something different than the others... a rubber sensor that probably isn't compatible or doesn't even work.  So $100 for NOTHING.\n\nThe icing on the cake was that my tires started going flat after I got out of there.  A few rides later (after highway driving and with kids in the car), my tire went completely flat on the way home, which could have been very dangerous.  For another tire, my husband can feel air coming out of the stent.  They didn't even install the tires right and they were all going flat!!!  \n\nThis is really the worst place ever, with the guy trying to make buck selling you some crappy brand of tires, crappy sensors, marking prices up once you walk in the door, and then to cap it all off, nothing is done right.  I hope that this place goes out of business.",

  "text": "Beware of this apartment complex. It is roach infested. I was moving to Palm Harbor from NY and practically did everything online. After a 28 hour drive I signed the papers half asleep and started unloading the truck. We slept that night on an air mattress because we were too tired to put the bed together.  I woke up to a roach walking on my arm. \nI tried to get out of my contract that morning but it was too late. I already signed (just hours earlier) and if I was to break my contract I would need to pay 3k we did not have.  So we got stuck. Throughout the next 6 months there was a roach guy coming in almost bi-weekly to spray, this did not help. I am allergic to roach dander which might be the reasons my eyes burned and nose dripped constantly. My poor dogs were always sneezing and coughing which made me think that all the roach spray affected them.  It was too small of an apartment for all of these chemicals to be ok. I just couldn't anymore. They knew I had issues. I called them so many times. I even thought about moving to a different apartment in that complex to avoid a fee, but when I looked in closets I found remnants of a dead roaches. \nI was new to the area, homesick and dealing with an apartment. I was even too grossed out to cook in our kitchen, or even sleep peacefully. \nMy husband and I decided to just move, it wasn't worth it anymore and honestly the sneezing and burning eyes were getting to me. \nThey knew I was dealing with all this roach crap, they knew I wasn't happy, all they can tell me was, \"well, that's Florida for you! We have bugs\" Every other local I asked told me that was not ok, that their home is free of roaches and that they are bullshitting me. \nI told them we were leaving and if they can give me a break on the \"breaking the contract\" fee. I begged. I even asked to speak to someone higher but they wouldn't let me. They would not give me a break on the fee even though they knew I have been a mess since I moved in there. \nFast forward to today, $2800 that I refuse to pay,  is going to collections over a ROACH INFESTED APARTMENT! This is totally unfair. I don't see why I should pay all this money when the apartment was not up to standards. \n\n\nUpdate. I called a few times and left messages. No response. Why bother replying to my review if you are not actually going to do anything about",

The location at Enterprise and McMullen Booth is the absolute worst DD I have ever been to and I have been to at least 100 DD restaurants around the country. I have given this location about half a dozen chances but this morning was the last straw. I understand every one has a bad day and needs another chance. This location is absolute slowest. This morning I was in more of a hurry than usual, and I placed my order online ahead of time so it would be ready for pick up when I got there. I pulled in the drive through ready for a hot meal and I was told to pull over, park and they would have it right out. Annoyed, I parked for 5 minutes before I entered the store. I was told they don't start the order until I'm at the location and give them my name. This absolutely defeats the purpose of ordering ahead of time. I finally received my order 25 minutes after I placed my order online. I would be more sympathetic if they were slammed. It was 5:30 am on a Saturday not another customer in the drive through or in the store. Owner of this location should be doing something about this. As you can see there are a string of similar complaints on this site over the last two years. This isn't isolated. I will be contacting corporate.",

  "text": "Horrible customer service and follow through: \nThis review is long overdue. I write it now as I still not have received any correspondence from management at Audio Express and I have grave concerns regarding both the integrity of their staff and customer service. \n\nLast December my husband purchased a remote car start from Audio Express. On the intake, their staff was helpful and excited to sell us this product. It all went downhill from there. Scheduling a time to have the starter installed (between my working schedule and their availability) took three months. \n\nWhen my husband did schedule an appointment it took an entire day to install. Upon returning to home, the headlight knob was not attached to my dash and there was some black gum-like substance seeming to be holding it in place. Immediately we called the store and spoke to the manager Chris. Chris told us that the gum was to stabilize while part while the clips were set. Sounded strange. He also told me to just push it in really hard and it would stay. I did and it dropped out again. I requested that they order me a new headlight knob as mine had been broken. Chris said that they could not do this and that their tech needed to look at the car before hand. \n\nWe made another appointment which was more difficult to schedule as I was told that the lead technician was needed to fix this problem. Finally, we were able to get in and my car was fixed, so I thought... I Asked Chris specifically if my car has been glued again (during the end of appointment walkthrough) and he assured me that it had not. He told me again that they used a tack to hold it in place so that they clips would hold. (I do have all of these conversations recorded on my phone). Feeling suspicious but seeing that my knob was in place I thanked him and drove home. \n\nAbout 2 months later the knob came loose again and was covered in black glue. I was outraged. I called the store and spoke to Chris who said he had no control of what his technicians did in the back and that he did not know anything about the glue. I asked for the manager and Chris said that he was the manager. I then asked for the owner and was told this was Rob. I called the number given which was a store in Colorado. Immediately the employees on the other end of the line became suspicious of my call and told me that Rob was a very busy man. I told the man (Lex) about my concern and experience and asked how I could relay this to Rob. Lex gave me an email for Rob that was info@audioexpress.com. This upset me as it is an information line and not a personal email or contact.  Lex also gave me the district Manager's name of Jeremy Valdez. I called this number as well and he was also unavailable. \n\nAs one final attempt at resolution I emailed Chris back. I demanded that my car be fixed and that I watch the install to ensure that the part not be glued in place for the third time. Chris asked for my VIN and said that he could get the part and mail it to me. I did receive the part but have yet to install it as I am not sure how and I do not feel comfortable returning to the store. \n\nI asked for a refund on my car starter as it cost me numerous visits and damaged my car. I was told no, and I still have not heard back from any management. Above all things mentioned, I am concerning this is happening to other customers.",

  "text": "The Bar is near the hotel we were staying in,  so our group of 8 thought we'd give it a go for Friday night dinner. I'd had lunch there in 2016 and the fried spinach appetizer was so good,  I was excited. \n\nThey were able to seat us immediately, which was great for such a large group and the place being pretty busy. We didn't have enough menus,  but that's ok,  I was focused beer first. Good selection of their own beers. It was cold outside, so I settled on their toffee porter. It was good (and warming due to the high abv).\n\nWhen I got the food menu, it's a typical pub menu with appetizers (no longer had the fried spinach which wad the first disappointment), sandwiches, wraps and burgers, flatbreads, and salads. I wanted something lighter, so ended up with the quesadilla from the app section (on the servers revomendation over a veggie flatbread). My dining companions ordered a variety of sandwiches, salads and wraps. My 'dilla was crispy, but not super hot temperature-wise (the overwhelming amount of fresh jalapenos in the filling did make it hot spice-wise). Overall, it was ok (plenty of other fillings and cheese), once 50% of the jalapeno were removed. The consensus of our table was that all the food was only marginal; overdressed salads, coldish wraps and sandwiches, and overall underweming sides. I snagged a few off the pub chips of a neighbiring plate- they were the stars of the show.\n\nService was friendly, but slow. Yes, it was a Friday night and most tables were full, but drink turnaround was slow, with few water refills, and the food took longer than standard turnaround time. If the food was piping hot upon arrival,  this timing would not have mattered, but it was not hot at all (warm might be generous). On a St. Louis summer day, this might not be a big deal, but on what seemed like the coldest night of the year, hot food is a must!\n\nTakeaways: I'd come back to sample more of the beer selections (they do taster flights). The beer would have to suffice to keep me warm (the food won't). And, if you see the fried spinach offered again, order this immediately!",

  "text": "I need to preface this review by saying I too have worked in the service industry for YEARS, and I understand the importance of reviews. I would NEVER come out and write a review just to be malicious, and it honestly took me months to even decide to write one. But after the recent uprisings against sexual harassment, I knew I had to. \n\n\nI waited such a long time before writing this review because I was so both flabbergasted and angry. I will not go into every explicit detail because I start to shake when I think about it. Ralph Carter is a chauvinist pig that deserves to be fired. I'm a 32 year old woman, and I was treated like a little girl. I was yelled at repeatedly, avoided (I live in Tampa, conveniently Ralph who will tell you he works 24/7/365 but is NEVER there when needed, so he could never meet me at the dealership when I could make it over). I paid for a car IN CASH on a Friday afternoon where no male employee could be found to take my money (naturally Ralph had already taken off for the day, but remember he works 8 days a week), but EVERY SINGLE MALE EMPLOYEE WAS OUTSIDE THE SERVICE GARAGE GAWKING AND STARING WHEN I WAS WALKING TO MY CAR. I sat in my car and watched them for several minutes. I was wearing a tank and jeans, and brought a jacket; this was hardly \"get noticed\" attire. It was like all of them had just gotten out of prison, and had never seen a woman before. \n\nThe entire process from start to finish was awful, but Ralph told me I was buying from the best, and this car would last forever --\n\nFunny how I go to get a first oil change and they tell me I had BLACK steering fluid and BLACK transmission fluid. \n\nThey wouldn't accept my paperwork the day I purchased car, flat out. They told me that guy was gone for the day (it was 11 am) and not to worry. Three weeks later they are white on rice on me looking for alternative payment. Why wouldn't they have looked over my paperwork the first day? Because there is a clause they don't explain that says if your loan isn't approved you owe $1000 plus .25/miles over 700 in a month, plus whatever little knicks you might put on it after driving off the lot. I put $2500 down. If I couldn't pay for the car in cash, I would have FOR SURE lost that entire deposit. But wait, didn't I ask them to look over everything already?!\n\nSTAY AWAY. This is a total scam, and Ralph Carter made it all the more miserable. Ralph Carter and the boys club of Crown Honda. \n\nHe's a bitter sexist... something. I said it. I don't get that he even listened to half of what I ever said, and I think it was because I'm a woman. He tried to shake my hand on a deal when I hadn't even seen the car yet!! Was it that he thought my sister and I were just dumb, or just women in general?!\n\nThis is my SEVENTH car, I've done this before. Purchasing a car is supposed to be so fun! And this just hurt my heart after a while. Still does, to be honest. \n\nI will NEVER go back, and my sister who was with me that day just purchased a brand new suv from a different dealership, told me what an amazing and easy time she had working with different people, right up the street from this circus. So this isn't typical Florida car buying. \n\nRemember, Ralph Carter is not your guy and this is not your dealership. No one deserves this.",

We had a large group that is fond of sharing, so we had the rare opportunity to try a great variety of things off the menu. Of the ten(ish) dishes I tried, only the stuffed mushrooms stood out as worth returning for. The trend here is deep-fried and cream-covered, but lacking depth of flavor. My main dish was the Delta Queen, and for $24, I expected SOMETHING more than what was essentially spaghetti with a fried seafood platter on top.\n\n\nDRINK:\n\nA solid standard full-bar! Their custom cocktails were nothing special, but the two guys behind the bar were knowledgable, personable, and quick on their toes. The 40-some minutes we spent here while waiting for a table was the best part of the whole evening.\n\nSERVICE (FOOD):\nOur table service was great. We were a group of eight, which means a lot going on, but our server did a great job getting everything right. It took a while for food to arrive, but it was a Friday night, and you can't expect magic to happen.\n\n\nSERVICE (HOST/HOSTESS):\nDespite calling ahead, both hostesses were \"short\" with our group, making it clear that we were a trouble for them. \n\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nNothing special here- just your average NOLA-style casual dining. I DID enjoy sitting upstairs more than down- it was quieter.\n\n\nPARKING:\nNone.\n\n\nFinal thoughts: While nothing was bad or wrong (except the unwarranted attitude from the hostess), Katie's offers nothing special enough to bring us back.",

Many responses, some saying he is wrong about them being acrylic and some posting pics of their cars done in 3M Crystalline saying right or wrong on the acrylic, he is wrong about not being able to tint them.   The one thing they all agree on....find a better tint shop.  I also spoke to BMW, who laughed at MCOR's assurance that these windows are made of some untintable material.  \n\nSo, I found a better shop.  Advanced Film Solutions.

I see someone has an appointment too that they showed up for so I'm not the only one who had this problem.

  "text": "I bought a 2015 Chevy Malibu from ARMEN dealership in May 2017. The sales person was VERY accommodating. He offered me the PLLATINUM PROTECTION PLAN. I declined. After I declined, the finance rep, STEVE, said that he had been there for years and that he used this plan himself and that the insurance company paid for a new tire immediately over the phone. STEVE assured me that the same courtesies would be extended to me if I were to get the same plan. It seemed too good to be true so I declined again. That was when STEVE became aggressive with me and really pushed the issue. Eventually, I said okay to the PLATNIUM PROTECTION PLAN. Fast forward three weeks and I had a flat tire. I call this \"protection plan\" and they informed me that they do not pay for flat tires to be fixed at any place of your choice nor do they provide payment over the phone. They must inspect the tire, determine the fault of the flat tire and there is no guarantee that you will get it fixed or a replacement. However, my fee of $1000.00 was guaranteed to ARMEN and it was paid via my credit card. STEVE, the aggressive, pushy finance person lied to gain a sale. He misrepresented the plan and now, I'm out of $1000.00. Also, while STEVE said that the plan offered 24 towing, the tow can only be to an ARMEN service and you have to be close to ARMEN because they only tow within a  specific amount of mileage to the dealership otherwise you pay. \n\n\nI tried to cancel my plan because it was useless and a scam... \n\nSteve from financing  told me to call the PLATINUM PROTECTION PLAN to cancel and PLATINUM PROTECTION PLAN told me to call ARMEN DEALERSHIP. After months of no returned phone calls from STEVE. I went to the dealership. I was belittled, dismissed, disrespected and lied to AGAIN! STEVE informed me that I was the only person in 10 years to want a refund. That was a LIE! The woman who commented before me had an issue as well. \n \n\nSTEVE from financing is a LIAR and he will say anything to get your money. STEVE never apologized. I am disappointed in this business and I will be sure to tell everyone I can DO NOT GO HERE EVER! ....AND DONT TRUST LYING STEVE FROM FINANCING! \n\n\nPS: STEVE used the owner as \"bait\" to close the deal. He said that the owner was hands on and very big on customer service.... THAT WAS A LIE! I never spoke to anyone after the deal was closed.. OWNER, if you read this FIRE STEVE! He does not provide honest customer service.",

Stopped in on a Saturday night to a full dining room and had to sit on the patio. No worries about that the weather was beautiful. Smoking is allowed on the patio which is a big turnoff while eating. Especially when employees come out and smoke there on there break.\n\nFood is reasonably priced. We started with a salad, French onion soup, and some complimentary bread sticks and marinara. Soup was over the top salty and not good. Salad and bread were above average.\n\nFor entrees we chose blackened chicken with fettuccine alfredo, chicken marsala, and manicotti. Chicken marsala was awful. Every one in the party took one bite and agreed. Being a special I would never run it again cause the chef obviously has no clue how to make it. Blackened chicken dish was below average.  Chicken was ok but Alfredo sucked, sauce being pasty and bland. Manicotti was the best dish and can't knock it at all.\n\nService was good our waitress being very efficient. The pour on a glass of wine was awesome. Food just wasn't very good. \n.",

We wanted to check out Indianapolis as it was pretty much mid point or a little beyond mid point from where we were coming from.  But luckily we found this place as we stayed out just one night.  When we got here the staff that was attending was saying  that they were pretty much booked up for the night.\n\nWe got our keys and headed to our room on the first floor, and when we got to the door I tried to get in... But nope, the door wouldn't open. It felt as if the latch was stuck and the door handle couldn't turn all the way. So I went back to the attending person and he came down and tried to open it. It took him several tries and more force until it finally swung open.\n\nInside, it was a hotel room. Nothing special, except this room was super old. You know those styling choices you made back in the 90's that aren't really up to date anymore? Yeah. That's what it was like. However, there's new hope for this place. The staff said that they were planning for renovations, which is sorely needed. \n\nI've definitely been to a better Marriott, but hey it was only for one night and we checked in around midnight. If you stay here they might have started renovating or already renovated so your experience could differ.",

We couldn't come to terms and to be honest I wasn't happy with the value they were giving me for my trade. \nWho ever is, lol.\nAnyways within a few minutes of me leaving the dealership the sales person Tiffany is texting me telling me saying she can get the manager to give me $400 more for my trade and that if I came back she would give me $500.00 to put down as a downpayment....I told her to keep her money because (a). Its against the amvic rules for her to even offer that and (b.) Who in there right mind would make such a offer???\nI gave tiffinay my terms and told her I'd be back only if they would accept them. \nShe got back to me and and told me she needed a deposit to show her boss I was serrious. I laughed and said sure why not. I gave the $500 via my visa and Tiffany sent me a picture text with the receipt for not only my $500 but another one she says is her $500 to put towards my purchase.....now this seems completely insane to me but whatever right.\nNext message from her told me that her manager accepted my offer. Perfect right?\nI gave my info to the finance office and\nthe next day She sends me a image of the bill of sale from the finance office as my wife was aproved.  I picked up right away that they had built $500 into the deal and you guessed it they put\n$500.00 in the dealerships favor by lowering the expected payout on my trade by exactly $500......so as I suspected her $500 although not expected and not asked for was nothing more than some sort of numbers game used to trick people into thinking they are getting something they are not. \nI know this sounds crazy and I wouldn't be surprised if you don't believe me, but msg me and I'll send you the texts and a pic of her card  so you can see the phone number and the texts belong to Tiffany at Go Kia South\n Don't deal with people who lie, don't deal with Kia on the south side. I called the dealership back and spoke with a manager, I forwarded the messages and proof of the fraud to him and he seemed disappointed but ultimately never called me back within 24 hours as he promised. Baised on that action I would assume this is normal practice for them and they don't really care, if they cared they would of called back.\nI'll be going to AMVIC with this as I think they should be made aware of this fraudulent activity.",

We went in for the $5 sangria special that was being advertised on their sign out front.  The sangria was awful.  I mean really awful.  It tasted like 80% lime juice with a splash of wine.  The lime, lemon, and apple slices in there were rotten.  My friend (who it doesn't take much to please) didn't even want to finish the drink.  Then we go to pay and the one bartender overcharged us for the drinks.  I said something to her, and I flat out heard the other bartender say \"I originally rang their sangrias in as $5, why did you change the price?\"  Are you serious???  I will never return again.",

After very little acknowledgement and 5 minutes of searching they find my subs and tell me have a good day, no receipt or anything.\n\nGet home, both subs are lukewarm (I live less than 5 minutes away) and the rosemary bread I ordered isn't in either bag, instead just their standard white. Both subs aren't cut, at all, which one down the center would have made sense for a medium.\n\nOn the plus side, it tasted good, but man, this location totally dropped the ball.",

Look at the pics and tell me if this is $288 worth of food?!!\n I used to really love this place and had ordered fajitas for parties at my house in the past but I totally got ripped off on this last order. I ordered steak and chicken fajitas, like I've done on 2 prior occasions and the portion sizes were pathetic for the amount of money I was charged($100 more than previously). I paid when I placed  the order as I've done on prior occasions. The day of the party I sent my husband to pick up the food.  He didn't know what I ordered so he was just my errand boy, so to speak. When I saw the pitiful trays of half full fajitas, I was mortified!  I called and spoke to Jose, the owner, and told him how displeased I was and asked him what he could do to remedy the problem.  The problem was I paid $288 for portions that were more like $100 worth! He basically told me he couldn't and wouldn't do anything about it and eventually hung up on me!  I'm outraged by his lack of customer service and complete denial that I had been overcharged! I ended up order pizzas and wings from Vincent's to supplement the lack of food I had for my guests. I will never, ever eat or order from Carisma Mexican Restaurant in Skippack and feel that I was completely screwed over!",

  "text": "What a nightmare!! We are in Philadelphia for the NAFSA convention and we booked at the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown. First off, the guy with the handkerchief in his jacket pocket at the reception had a chip on his shoulder. We flew in from Los Angeles on a redeye flight, got into the hotel at around 7 AM and were super tired. We asked this guy if he would be kind enough to let us check in earlier by giving us a call as we waited in the vicinity. He callously said \"okay\" without even asking for our telephone number. We knew right then he really was not into helping us.\n\nAt $175 per night, we had to pay $15 a day for Internet connection. There was only a tiny bottle of shampoo and a small bar of soap. When we asked for body wash, we were told that's only available to guests on the upper floors. On our second day, we ran out of shampoo and tried to call the reception to ask for another tiny bottle of shampoo. The phone rang for a good 5 minutes with no one answering. This was at around 11:30 PM. We had no choice but to get dressed to go downstairs to the reception to ask for an extra bottle of shampoo. The lady at the reception acted in the same callous manner as the guy with the chip on his shoulder. No apologies whatsoever.\n\nThe carpet in our room is warped. The front entrance to the hotel was littered. There were smears and fingerprints on the revolving door. \n\nI travel extensively and stay at other Sheraton properties in other parts of the world. This has to be the WORST Sheraton hotel I ever stayed at. \n\nThis is my first online review of anything since I'm usually too busy to write. However, this time I couldn't help but to start writing this review because I don't want my fellow travelers to make the same mistake as we did by staying at the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown.\n\nI hope the corporate office of Sheraton will take note of my and many other negative reviews of this particular property and try to protect their goodwill and namesake by proactively improving their service and make necessary changes.",

Waiter was great - high energy and was accommodating in drinks, refills of chips and salsa and easily took our order.  What he couldn't help was the oddness of the food - the black beans were swimming in a salt water mix with a few onions, the fish tacos came with a vat of odd mayo and the refried beans were just...bland.  No taste.  Thankfully the chips and salsa were excellent and we ate with our coats on.   Maybe it's great in the summer with a margarita, but without flavor and some heat... will pass.",

  "text": "If I had time to read the reviews before hand, I would never have made the mistake of using this company to handle my restoration services.  On December 29, 2018, my condo flooded.  My insurance recommended that I use vendors that they had worked with in the past:  Peerless and Bobby Pages.  We were very distraught with the damage so we called Scott who runs Peerless pick up and delivery service. He came in and surveyed the damage and gave us this schpiel on how much experience his company has and ofcourse how much better they were than Bobby Pages. (whatever).  He gave us a timeline of 3 weeks which was fine.  To his credit there were some work clothes I needed right away and he was able to get them back to me the next day.  For that I will give this review 1 star.  \nWe got one delivery of a few items like snow boots and blankets with the promise that the remainder would be coming in the following Monday. \nWe heard nothing all week.  I had to call him and he tells me he is taking the day off in Tahoe. He blamed the plant for not finding all our bags of clothes and that would call them and call us back.  We got \"crickets\".It has been a series of excuse after excuse as to why he has not delivered the remaining items.  We have been back in our condo for  a week and a half and we have no drapes to put up on our front windows.  A 3 week delivery window is quickly turning into 4 weeks.Needless to say I will be letting my insurance adjuster know to take this company off their list of vendors and on every avenue of social media warning people to stay away from this incompetent company!!!",

My issue is with the kitchen staff who failed to notice the mold. I don't understand how they managed to cook it thinking it was ok to send out like that. Even with this bad experience the staff is friendly and they still have the best grilled cheese around!",

He couldn't  participate  as much as usual here. \n\n We chose the pirate plunder and asked them to set for kids level since he was with us. They acknowledged and set it up. When we stopped at an hour I mentioned this was not kid friendly,  they responded  that it was their hardest one. What????\n\nClues were NOT  clear.

Locks should be clear on whether need 4 or 6 digits or a word. I wasted  time on important lock that needed word not numbers ( the other of same type had 6 digits)\n\nIf you must go there,  get their groupons or many coupons  or discounts.  We didn't, but that happens when you are on vacation \n\nManagement,  I suggest that your game master  is key to escape room satisfaction.  Not sure if game master  and hostess communicated well.",

  "text": "Super small restaurant.  We walked in with 5 people and they couldn't seat us together, which was disappointing.  I've been vegetarian for 10 years, and honesty I'm tired of these tiny overpriced veg restaurants.  Being vegan/vegetarian does not mean eating pricey fancy foods in claustrophobic restaurants that can only fit small parties or people going on dates.  Everytime I try these places, I feel ripped off and never want to go back.  I always end up preferring regular restaurants with veg options that don't cost an arm & a leg and can seat your party comfortably.\n\nThe food -- I ordered the Spicy Dan Dan Noodles (see picture) and it was blah because it was drenched in sauce so you can barely taste the noodles, and the sauce was drenched in hotness so you can barely taste the other flavors commingled in the sauce.  Lastly, it was Very expensive for such a small dish.  $14!!!\n\nThis place hits your wallet and it doesn't feel worth it.",

I have no cash with me.  No sign announcing this.  I have waited in line and while being helped because the counter girl answered the phone during my order.  I keep an emergency $100 folded in the back of my wallet. I pull it out and they do not have enough change. At this point I'm like shove the donuts up your ass and take some customer service lessons.

I Had someone call in and pay for service as a gift, only to not have it applied. \n\nWhile getting my lashes done in the end spa, all I could hear was a screaming young child that was in the back with the workers.

This was about more than just paying for a service and being told this wouldn't happen again, a child was in the back with industrial cleaning equipment where no child belongs.

I came during a promotion at opening, and their chicken sandwiches seem to mimic Chik-Fil-A but more costly and less tasty. The portions are tiny; the guys definitely did not consider it a meal. I also wish they served at least tap water, because we were forced to buy bottled water given our thirst. At least the interior seating is nice, and there are two nice large center tables to accommodate groups as well.

  "text": "Working with Love, Leon (formerly Krauter photography) was the most stressful part of planning our wedding. We were profoundly disappointed with the lack of client-care, honesty and communication throughout the entire process, even in the delivery of photos.\n\nWe hired Lauren + Casey because we liked their style, we wanted a husband/wife duo and we wanted Indy locals (we live in Los Angeles, our wedding was in my hometown of Indianapolis). We were happy to hear that Lauren, like us, felt it was important to meet in-person to talk vision + prep before the wedding. We agreed to meet in the June and July months when I was scheduled to fly home to Indianapolis. After hiring Love, Leon and putting down our 50% deposit, we felt that Lauren's interest in us and our wedding ended.\n\nAt the beginning of June, I reached out to Lauren to set + confirm our first in-person meeting. Lauren informed us that she and her husband (2nd shooter) were moving to Germany at the end of the week and she would be unable to meet until the afternoon before my wedding day. As I probed further, she admitted that Casey was no longer available to shoot the wedding and she had already hired a new 2nd shooter. When I searched for this photographer online, I came up blank. There was no Instagram, no website, no reviews and no verifiable online presence of her work. Lauren supplied us with two private links to photos, but asked me to \"trust her on this one\" even though she had never shot a wedding with this person.\n\nWe begged for our deposit back. Because so much had changed, we wanted to go with another photographer and part ways with no hard feelings. She refused to make an exception and informed us that she would be keeping our deposit regardless of our decision. We didn't have the budget to pay another photographer without getting that $1,650 deposit back, so we had to proceed with Lauren and try to make the best of this new situation.\n\nHer demeanor on the day-of was good and she handled herself well with our bridesmaid photos. The only thing that struck me as odd & unprofessional was when she asked the Matron of Honor to buy her an Uber home during the reception. \n\nAfter delivering the photo galleries, we noticed that a vast majority of the family and group shots were blurry. The trees behind us were focused, but all of our faces were out-of-focus.  I reached out to Lauren asking for sharper versions that were suitable for printing and using in a photo book. At this point, she admitted that she had made a mistake with her camera during our group photo session and she did not have any in-focus photos of our wedding party, the bride's family, the bride + groom's family or my grandparents. \n\nI was stunned. I reached out to some professional photographer friends to see if anyone could salvage the images. I received an overwhelming response that this was not a camera setting issue, but rather a fundamental photography-skill issue. A photographer may occasionally slip into back-focus for one or two frames out of a hundred, but anyone who bills themselves as a professional would see this mistake after a shot or two and fix it immediately on-site preventing further blurry photos. \nThey were all stunned to find out that she hadn't fixed it on-location, and further than she hadn't owned up to the rookie mistake upon delivery. She waited to see if we would catch it. The whole thing just doesn't sit well with me. \n\nAll this to say - Love, Leon added stress to the wedding process rather than alleviating it. Maybe it was a one-time mistake, but I wouldn't recommend taking that risk on your wedding day. If you're a bride or groom who values communication, transparency and an overall positive experience in wedding planning, I would urge you to explore other photographers in Indy. \n\n**NOTE: As a courtesy, I let Lauren know in advance that we would be sharing our honest experience on this platform. In response, she offered + provided a 50% refund for the $3,600 contract and apologized as she understands that nothing can replace the fact that these images were not captured. She will \"use this as an opportunity to learn and grow.\"**",

During the initial sales communication we were impressed by the service available at follow up but that changed as the paperwork was being signed and during my first call for service.  We (my wife and I) were originally told that the first winterization would be complementary and if we did the annual roof inspection \"x\" amount of roof sealant would be complementary, if needed, during the inspection.  When we asked the finance person about the roof sealant he was unaware of any such service and when I called for the winterization I was told that they do not do that service unless I had a coupon from the sales person (which I didn't).  I left a voicemail for the salesperson at that time and he informed there was no documentation in the sales paperwork of that agreement.  In addition I had emailed the salesperson twice with no response days after the initial sale about a question regarding towing suggestions (he is a very good resource) and received no response.  He was outstanding responding to emails prior to the sale but after that there was no response (possibly his email server was down?).  During our PDI there were a couple concerns (they fixed many quick issues while I waited that night) that we feel needed to be addressed before delivery but the sales person assured us that there will be other concerns that arise over the first year and it's best do rectify them all at that time.  I will provide a follow up after that service.  Overall average sales experience but Dean is a very knowledgeable salesperson, initial impression appears that the service should be good when you schedule well in advance and plan to stay and wait for some service, great location if you live in or close to STL.",

(Reminded us of the ridiculous, unnecessary long lines at Tony Luke's.) \nissues:\n1- The meat is seasoned with a quick, little sprinkle of salt and pepper - not enough to get the flavor/taste right.\n2- We watched our meat being grilled from moment it was a hard frozen block - it didn't get any seasoning, so it was tasteless.\n3- Meat doesn't cover the bread. Inch of just bread at each end of roll.\n4- French's yellow mustard! Really? It's disgusting...got to at least offer spicy mustard too. \n5- No hot sauce\n6- No hot peppers out. Asked for them, guy said they had them but forgot to give them to me.\n7- The Aversa bread was a basic Amoroso style squishy/airy steak roll. Nothing to rave about.",

I ordered the rice with chicken, chopped salad (cucumber and tomato), cabbage, and pickles topped with garlic and the S'khug (green spicy sauce.)\n\nThe rice was fine but not that flavorful, the chicken was clearly old, as it was dried out, and didn't taste as if it had been marinated in anything. The other issue was the balance between the garlic sauce and the s'khug.. there was too much s'khug and it was not well distributed.  Net net, I have had better. I think if the ingredients were fresh, and the sauces were on the side the experience would have been better.\n\nThe pita is a good pita, but almost superfluous with a rice bowl, and the take out drink (san pellegrino blood orange soda) was good but I would have preferred the option of a well made lemonade or ice tea. \n\nI will return to try the falafel as they look to be quite good and the toppings remind me of Israeli falafel shops.  However their rice bowls will certainly not be in heavy rotation.",

The hostess saw me standing waiting to be seated, acknowledged I was there, and walked away, leaving me waiting for 10 minutes before being seated.  \n\nThe menu was advertised as Chinese/Japanese buffet, in reality I found a very small amount of Asian style dishes at the buffet, but a broad amount of fried chicken, fries, pizza, seafood, mac and cheese, and more of the like.  I tried the Asian dishes and found the buffet dishes bland and rather stale.  The sushi was limited and poor in quality, much the same as the prepackaged sort one might purchase at a supermarket.  The hibachi and poke grills were fresh and made to order.  \n\nThere were signs posted everywhere citing children under 10 years needed to be accompanied to get food, but the staff did nothing to enforce this, there were small/young children running all about who don't hesitate to run into patrons trying to get food.  \n\nThe furniture and facility on the whole seemed modern and cleanly.  \n\nIf I absolutely had to attend a buffet on the spot and had no other choices I'd patronize United Buffet again, otherwise I'm going to keep on the search for a buffet with better quality food and service elsewhere.",

Below is the post from a great friends of mine and the treatment received by a double amputee veteran and his service dog. \n\n\"I have never seen such blatant discrimination as I did from this place last night. As our group began to walk in, the bouncer stopped a friend (who happens to be a double amputee and has a service dog) and would not allow him in with the dog. The bouncer said it was for safety reasons for the rest of the guests. He did offer to let him take the dog to the upstairs bar. \"Great\" we said \"point us to the elevator\"...no elevator so we were told \"well, you're out of luck\". We asked 4 different people to see a manager. After an hour a manager came. She said she would have come sooner but she was far too busy and can't come running for every little thing. While waiting for that hour we also tried to flag down numerous police to explain that it's a federal law that service animals be allowed to accompany their handlers. The reply...It's a civil matter. Finally after talking to the manager we were told we could enter. All we had to do was explain how the dog is of service. I think that's when they finally realized his handler has no legs. We walked in and said \"you have a better shot at seeing Elvis than you do of any one of us spending money here\" and walked right out. Best part of that hour is that I explained to everyone who was going in what was happening and 99% of them turned around and went elsewhere. Which is what I'll also ask of anyone reading this post. If you go to NOLA spend your money somewhere else!\"",

  "text": "My husband and I rarely get a date night anymore, so when we do we usually stick to our tried-and-true faves. But last night we wanted to try something new. We learned our lesson, yet again. Honestly don't know where all the 5* are coming from. Did we eat at the same restaurant?\nLove what they've done with the layout and decor, music was a little loud and the tables are awkwardly long so you have to shout... maybe I'm just getting old. Cutesy names cocktails were delicious when they finally arrived halfway through our first appetizer. \nFirst we got our broccolini and hummus with turnips/onions- no baba ghanoush but it probably takes longer to cook...  broccolini good but nothing special. Hummus was lovely especially with fluffy house made pita. Turkish wine red and white delicious- still no baba ghanoush- we order two more apps as entrees. \nA good 15-20 min after we finish \"first course\", waiter got snippy with my husband when he inquired about it. Excuse me?! It eventually arrives: a huge portion of an entire large eggplant topped with a mound of raw red onion and a pice if bread half the size of the eggplant. \nA couple minutes later our entire course arrives. Unimpressed to say the least. Husband has lamb kebabs and lettuce like a street cart and my $18 scallops consist of 2 medium sized over cooked over seasoned pieces on top of potato purée way too garlicky (didn't know there was such a thing) and salty green beans. \nMissed the mark by a long shot- food and service.",

It was a mini sized creme brûlée? It's my go-to at the other location, but last night they young woman served it to me in a small foil container. It was no bigger than the size of my spoon yet the price was the same. See pic attached.  Also, I told her we were dining in yet she served me in to go containers. Wasteful.",

Every pasta dish i have had has hardly any flavor.\n\nNot to mention the prices are extremely high for what you get. $15 on average for a pasta dish that fazzolis can do a better job of making. \n\nThe menu looks legit, sounds tasty, and makes you believe you are getting authentic Italian food that is going to blow you away. In reality though the food is terrible and is outrageously overpriced. \n\nApparently they recently took new management and it this place used to be great. \nI don't see this place lasting much longer. \n\nMy advice is to just go somewhere else. I'd rather eat grocery store bought ragu sauce and noodles than eat here. \n\nThe service is sub par as well.",

In addition to that, When my mother asked the woman at the register to repeat what she said, the woman yelled in my mothers face. I was absolutely appalled. The place itself is also very cramped and unorganized. There are people practically walking over each-other and just to get to their tables. There is also an issue with the cleanliness, the fact that there were flies and other bugs constantly coming around me and my food was very unsettling. In addition to the cleanliness issue, the floor did not look swept and the tables did not look wiped down. As well as, the woman who is supposed to be cleaning is talking to the other workers and not keeping up with the mess in the dining area. This is not what i expect from ANY restaurant, i am shocked and I will not be coming back here again.",

She was responsible for doing my color, blow drying, and treatment.  The only thing Tah did was straighten my hair.  Tah is very rude as she did not greet me as a new client, she just walked right past me for over an hour. All the stylist were preoccupied with watching Game of Thrones during the time they were doing my hair. I'm natural, but the shampoo girl combed my hair from the top of my head, instead of starting at the bottom and working her way up.  I advise you, save your money, find a stylist who can really take care of your hair, because Tah is not it.  The environment is extremely loud instead of being relaxing, as it should be.  I am so disappointed and I will not ever be back.",

  "text": "I would not recommend this location, I have been to New Orleans a few times and have eaten and Drago's Metairie which was amazing. The food was excellent the service was amazing. \nI was in town and decided to go to Drago's at the Hilton location, got there at are 7:45 got to the hostess who was slumped over with her face propped up in her hands. We were informed that the wait for a table for three was an hour which normally will not be a problem but it being we had just gotten in town and was exhausted from traveling we opted to try it another night. I asked if we could make a reservation for the following night which the half asleep hostess said they don't accept reservations, again no problem there we decided that the following day we will return and wait while we get a few drinks at the bar. \nThe following day came we showed up at 6:45 got to the hostess (not the same from the night before) asked to place my name on the list, the response was they are not taking names until 8pm since they are only seating customers with a reservation which puzzled me for a second since the night before I was told they don't take reservations. \nWell to get to the point and not keep going on we ended up eating at this location another night and at the other location on this trip again, and can say the food and service at both location are very different. I would highly recommend taking a short Uber ride to Metairie where the true culinary experience of of New Orleans is guaranteed. \nDrago's Hilton location will leave disappointed and make you miss in my opinion the best charbroiled oysters at Drago's Metairie.",

Service diagnosed the vehicle as needing 8 Spark Plugs and 8 ignition coils. At a cost of over 1000 dollars. Of course this is not covered under the \"powertrain\" warranty. The dealers solution was to give me one spark plug and one coil. A joke.  They didn't even install the parts! This place is a poor excuse for a business.

We went to many dealerships all over edmonton, finally we came to sherwood dodge and that's where it all began.. we were test driving a car from another dealership at the time they ended up giving us keys to one of their models so we drove that instead because they dident want us going back to the last place for obvious reasons and they made us wait in the waiting room for 6 hours with our 3 month old baby because they assured us the financing was almost done. They came back several times to tell us it was almost done etc. But really they were just wasting our time and convincing us we shouldn't leave. Hours go by, still nothing we went looking for someone to talk to because we wanted to leave and of course they had our car keys and nobody knew where they were nor did they care to find them. Finally they came and told us everything was ready at 9 at night and when we got done talking price they told us we would have a check for myself because of the 2 previous dodge vehicles I purchased as a referral/loyalty cheque it's been 3 weeks since we signed papers and they cant seem to figure out how to get a 300$ cheque out especially after buying a 40 thousand dollar jeep. \n\nTLDR: dealer held us hostage by not giving our keys to the car because they misplaced them waited 6 hours in waiting room with hungry crying 3 month old baby assured everything was ready when it wasent and cant even figure out how to sign a cheque of 300 dollers that was promised to us after buying a 40 thousand dollar jeep.

It is taking several weeks for the rest of the parts for the doors that we already paid for to come in. We bought the doors from a retail store in Montgomeryville Pennsylvania and I've spoken to the store manager who's name is AJ several times about this. AJ has been extremely rude and unprofessional to us and told us that our $500 purchase is not worth Lowe's expediting the parts faster. AJ threatened us if we called corporate and told us that corporate would do nothing for us except pass the message along back to him. Well he was right! We have talk to corporate several times and was promised by several supervisors that the regional manager will contact me to give us some type of compensation for the issues that we've been having. I have never ever received a call from any supervisor or regional manager from Lowe's that was promised. Lowes has our money and we do not have doors and we do not have anyone from the Montgomeryville store apologizing to us or trying to solve our situation. I strongly recommend that no one ever buy products from Lowe's if they are improving their home buying, a new homeowner, or selling their house because if there's a problem corporate does not have your back and does not care about you. It's more than obvious that the employees of Lowes have no idea how to do their job except on how to take your money. Do yourself a favor and shop at Home Depot Lowes is absolutely horrible!",

  "text": "I don't really understand the five star reviews.  First, I came knowing that it was expensive, and this review has nothing to do with that.  I was prepared to pay top dollar, and in that, my expectations were met.  \n\nMaybe we should have sat below deck.  The downstairs was beautiful.  But we wanted the open air.  It was a beautiful evening, about 70F and no humidity, so why not?  We got our table for five after a minimal wait, which was OK.  It didn't seem to be terribly busy, and there were plenty of waitstaff around.\n\nWe sat down and there were only four place mats for the five of us.  Oops.  So we swiped one from an empty table nearby.  \n\nNo place settings.  The waitress (who was pretty casual about keeping an eye on our table in case we needed something and pretty skilled at avoiding eye contact as she cruised past our table) took our drink orders and returned shortly with picnic style place settings - a knife and fork for each of us, all unceremoniously dropped at the end of the table, each wrapped in a paper napkin.  Should they be placed by each person at the table?  This didn't impress me, given my expectation that I'd be paying about $45 average for entrees and $15 for appetizers.  \n\nOur table was no more than ten feet from the bar, so why did it take fifteen minutes for our drinks to arrive?  And no draft beers, another minor thing piled on top of several other minor things.\n\nThe appetizers were tasty but the portions were sub-par.  Three shrimps?  About a half teaspoon of lobster in the lobster bisque?  You can do better.\n\nThe entrees were delicious, no complaints there.  It took a while for it to arrive, but we were in no hurry.  \n\nDessert was not up to par.  A couple of us ordered them, and it was obvious when they arrived, after a considerable time, that they weren't made to order, as I would expect considering the price, but merely taken from the freezer.  So why would it take so long for them to arrive?\n\nNo coffee!  I asked for a cup of coffee (I didn't order dessert) and was told that they didn't serve coffee on the deck because it was so far from the kitchen.  What?  What kind of BS is this?\n\nFinally, the music was SO loud.  I guess I should have asked if they could turn it down.  It wasn't like anyone was dancing, but it was loud enough to drown out normal conversation.  \n\nSo except for the dessert, I give the food four or five stars.  Sitting on the deck enjoying the open air was very nice.  But the indifferent, inattentive service rates only one star.  I feel like for the prices you can expect to pay, you should expect attentive service and at least a little pampering.",

Most of the reviews here are in regards to the brunch...if those sheeple had my dinner, they would never dine here for brunch... Do you people eat sushi?

The Media location which I've been to many times is nice, however very average. I've given this place 3 tries... After terrible service, a bone in my sushi, cartilage in my wife's sushi, small terrible sushi rolls, and cold coffee to finish it off...I'm done. OK, I get that this is a \"Hip\" place for Mainliners...but WOW... I'd go to the Asian bistro down the street that got closed for a cockroach infestation over this place. And the sad part is....that place is still open!!! Very comical...maybe the same owners??? I'm sorry I have to say goodbye Azie...some Mainliners are fooled, but I am not...Sorry to be so blunt with my review...but the only thing you kinda have going for you, is that hot rock Kobe beef appetizer. Maybe focus more on the cooked food?...but wait...my coffee was cold, so... my suggestion...If you want to spend $400 on sushi...go to Nectar. The servers are terrible as well...but the food is above average.",

The drink machines are not responsive, and even 2 of the paper towel dispensers in the bathroom were broken. After we sat down we realized that we accidentally did not get the 3D+ seats, nor did we receive our glasses. When I went back out to get the glasses and asked about the seats, I was told only 3 rows had the special seats and was not given an option to upgrade, even though the theatre was not full. The customer service was terrible all told. Invest in people and not machines and you'll have a better business. The woman at the ticket booth was the only person there, and I bet I would have gotten better service if she wasn't so overworked.

  "text": "4 Star food but 1 star service. We had a reservation and still had to wait probably 45 minutes for our food despite having a reservation and many empty tables around us. Server didn't even bother to refill our waters until we were halfway through the meal even though we clearly finished the water containers she originally brought to the table 15 min after sitting down because we had a large group. She was very friendly, just very lazy. Perhaps they had a large breakfast rush and she was just tired because it's the weekend but still not an excuse for how bad the service was and how slow the kitchen was despite there only being 2 or 3 smaller groups in the restaurant while we were there. I finished most of my sandwich and moved the meat to the side of my plates in hopes of getting a box. Instead of asking whether or not I was finished with my plate she took it literally when my head was turned because we were mid-conversation. She wasted a perfectly good piece of chicken, pickled pot belly, and fries which just bothers me because I feel like this restaurant is trying to make themselves appear \"sustainable.\" While, sustain this, HIRE BETTER WAIT STAFF",

The purpose of a lettuce wrap (an unwich) is that one can still pick it up like a sandwich but without the bread. I think this may have skipped an employee's mind today. They were probably wondering how the heck I was going to eat this thing without utensils. Or...they skipped training 101. I emailed a complaint to HQ and was given an apology letter. Thanks for your apology but I'm not accepting it.",

  "text": "I hardly could say that the sushi here was as good as in some other places I have had visited in Tampa Bay Area. I used to have lunch and dinner in both locations of the restaurant in New Tampa and Dale Mabry Avenue so that it is fair to say the restaurant should improve the quality of the food a lot if they have ever wanted to boost the business. Otherwise, it would not be my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in Tampa. The nigiri, for example, had too much rice while the fish cut was thin and cheap. The fish like salmon or white tuna were not very fresh also. As for regular pieces of fish, they were all pale in color - the salmon, if it was fresh, should be deep pink/orange, but rather a light orange. The hibachi steak was pretty chewy and harsh. Sometimes, the sushi rice was dried and bland as I could not taste any sour flavor of vinegar as the sushi rice was supposed to be. Thus, I would pay few dollars extra to have a better AYCE sushi experience elsewhere.",

I thought I would give them one more chance to redeem themselves  so I went a second time . I picked a gel color for my toes and they used a \" similar \" color on my nails that was quite different from what I asked for . I showed the technician a picture of how I want my gel refill and she didn't do what I asked for . My gel refill was better than what it was last time but it was still not what I wanted. 4 technicians worked on my nails in one visit which is not good . Then they overcharged me for services which is probably why prices are not listed in a visible area so that they get over on people .",

My friend ordered a hamburger and a side of mac and cheese. When the food came out my salad had bacon in it. I asked the waiter about it and he hunched his shoulders and walked off. My friend never got his mac and cheese. And at the beginning of the night the bread that they brought out had been reheated in the microwave and was hard as a rock.  My friends Burger was okay. At the end of our visit when paying for the bill I asked the waiter about the bacon and the conversation that we had about my diet his response was that he was sorry and did not know there was bacon on the salad. I probably will not return for another visit seeing that this visit was below-par. My friend and I chose this restaurant because we had seen it many times and always wanted to try it.

  "text": "Well I've been here for seven months now, and I can see why someone checked off that my initial review was funny. The staff at Solaris Key are very nice to you when you're looking to rent, however, once you've moved in, not so much.  The apartments here are very small and the walls are very thin.  Subsequently, you can hear your neighbors when they get up and when they go to bed. For a short term lease, this is probably not a bad deal but long-term I don't know about you, but I don't want to be awakened at 5 o'clock in the morning with my upstairs neighbors moving their appliances.  I was told when I moved in that there are visitors parking spaces on the side of the building, so when my guests arrived for a holiday weekend I instructed them to park on the side of the building not realizing that there's only three spots that are designated for visitors; my guest's car was towed; no warning, no call, nothing just towed. The front gate was broken for about three months, and the primary reason why many of the residents moved here is for security purposes. During the time the gate was broken, several vehicles were broken into.  Just recently, I had knee surgery and my mother picked me up from the doctors office and was parking the car and I no sooner got into my apartment when I got a call from Cole, a salesperson in the rental office, stating that my car is double parked, pictures have been taken of it and it needs to be moved immediately.  Mind you, this was on a Monday there's no other cars in the parking lot but mine and clearly we had no intention of leaving our car double parked, I just needed the space to navigate my walker from the car to my apartment. The office clearly needs to focus on their customer service skills, getting new renters and stop harassing the current residence.  There is a lot of competition in the rental arena, so needless to say, if I were the management here, I would focus on keeping their current occupants happy, not harass them.  Needless  to say I cannot wait to move out of here! No, I do not recommend this place unless you are looking for a short-term situation.\nIf you are looking for an apartment, you need to be observant about potential neighbors in the building.  Notice the noise levels, how tidy the buildings are being kept, and what the atmosphere is at night to gain insight on the neighborhood.",

We declined -as we know the driver handle was in great shape @ drop-off & had to be damaged upon the cylinder replacement.  We find it ironic that normal business practice for car service companies usually notify a customer with a phone call if not present to indicate there is a problem in an area they are working on in Advance to allow the customer to decide if they want it fixed or not as they wan to minimize liability for themselves.

  "text": "This is the second time in approximately 3 years I've had my oil changed at Franklin Oil Stop using a Groupon.  The first time I was suspicious that they didn't change the filter (which was included in the price of the Groupon) because my vehicle has a metal shield under the engine that has to be removed in order to get to the filter.  However, I figured maybe they had a special tool I didn't have when changing my oil at home that would enable them to reach the filter without removing the shield so I dismissed my concerns.  However, this time I taped a Sharpie marker to the end of a broom handle and reached down through the engine compartment with it and put a distinctive mark on the side of the filter with the Sharpie prior to going to get my oil changed.  Fast forward to me leaving Franklin Oil Stop after receiving a receipt that states they changed both oil and filter...I drive over to the Home Depot parking lot and pop the hood and guess what's staring back up at me when I look down through the engine compartment at the filter?  The same Nissan branded oil filter bearing the same distinctive Sharpie mark I put on the filter prior to leaving home.  While it's not out of the question to skip changing the filter every other oil change there's no way these guys would know if this is the 2nd or 22nd time they skipped changing your filter which puts your engine at risk of damage.  More importantly when you agree to perform certain services for a fee and knowingly don't perform all services for that fee that is tantamount to fraud.  Once again I am reminded of my grandmother's words of wisdom, \"If it seems to good too be true, it probably is.\"  Before going to Franklin Oil Stop look at the price they're charging and then look at the overall cost of materials (oil & filter), even using the cheapest prices around for oil and filter you're looking at a situation in which the materials cost almost as what Franklin Oil Stop is offering to do the entire job for.  You can't offer a deal at almost break even pricing when you haven't even included labor, insurance, utilities, insurance, etc.  Unless playing Russian roulette with your vehicle engine is your idea of fun, stay away from here.",

I took my daughter here to celebrate her birthday, along with my father that I hadn't seen in a year. Our seating arrangement on the balcony was nice and the gentleman, Arrow, who sat us was an absolute delight. The rest was pretty upsetting. The menu description did not adequately describe my $24 pasta dish. It was smothered in flavor hindering cheese and when I asked for a side of corn for my 10 year old, noone mentioned it would be too pepper hot for even myself to eat. My dad ordered a $13 spicah salad and it was the size of a side salad and was limp.\nI decided it was worth letting the manager know about the experience we were having so I went downstairs where the host was located to ask to speak to someone. Both the manager and the server took it upon themselves to chastise me for \"how\" I asked to speak with her and told me I should have just stayed upstairs in my seat and asked for her there. \nThey took the meal (and the corn) off and that's fine, but I left hungry, having spent $90 plus a modest tip, and scorned. \nWith so many choices in New Orleans, I'm upset with having wasted both the time, the money, and what could have been a great experience elsewhere. I do not reccomend this place.",

When my food arrived, I found that there were no tortillas for my fajitas. This is the responsibility of the restaurant to ensure my order is packaged up correct, not the delivery man.  I didn't have time to worry about the tortillas, as I was on my lunch break. The vegetables didn't seem like they were even cooked. The chicken had an odd texture to it. And the tortilla chips were stale. When I called the restaurant to complain, I got an employee on the line who couldn't have cared less, and actually said in a rude tone \"so what do you want me to do about it?\" At this point, I just gave up. It's too bad that this happened because the restaurant looks really nice, but I will not be going there.",

(not anymore bc I was DONE with this place) all I can say is thank the Lord I am out. The first year was okay but vista just spiraled downhill for some reason. My experience in Vista was terrible the last year. I don't even have words to express how exhausted I became only after 3 months of living there. I tried to get out of my lease, but since it was a year long contract, I couldn't. And they told me I had to find someone to take my lease. That didn't help bc almost everyone I knew was put off by the price of living there ($700/person for a 2 bedroom and over $1000 for a single bedroom).. yeah. There was no way I was able to market my place to college students. Anyway, what made me so frustrated was management. It was by far the worst. My roommate and I dealt with constant music till 3am on weekdays from our neighbors and we talked to management 3 times in person, countless times by email and phone ... nothing was done to help us. We have also called security numerous times during the night and guess what? Security number hardly ever worked. Our neighbors also fought so many times, it was not even funny. Even when it was 4am ( walls are super thin here) It got so violent with the fighting that cops had to come to vista and one of the residents had to be removed from that room. By the way, management kept reassuring us that things would change. We would feel reassured and then let down each time. It was very frustrating. We have also left countless notes on our neighbors' doors and have let management know this. Still, no changes. \nI hardly ever right reviews but I really don't want anyone to have to go through this while spending over $700 or more for rent. Save yourself please and find a decent apartment complex if you are able to drive off campus. Sure.. it's close to campus but trust me. Its not worth the money and lack of sleep and the amount of frustration. \nI eventually moved out and decided to pay 2 months of rent even though I wasn't living there bc YES it was that terrible. I could not handle it any longer. \nALSO, if you don't have a car and need to live close to campus, just live on campus dorms. Dorms at least has some sort of regulations and rules. Vista has none from what I could tell. If they did, it was not reinforced. \nIf you took the time to read this, please know that I am being brutally honest here. As I mentioned, I never right reviews for anything bc I find it boring, but I am simply hoping to save people from this place and tell you that your money is worth spending elsewhere. Thank you and God bless.",

I've liked this place literally since before I was born (my mom ate here a lot when she was pregnant with me).  I ordered two Biff Burgers and two Biff Deluxe, simple order right?  The guy working the drive thru says?  \"Oh, you want doubles?\"  No, just two Biffs and two Biff deluxe.  After going back and forth he finally got it.  I waited for the food and I checked it before I drove back home.  All four burgers were ice cold.  Went back and asked for a refund and the guy says \"wait, I have some cooking on the grill now.\"  So after waiting he slings the bag out the window and says \" I made them all doubles\" like he was doing me a favor.  I said, \"I didn't want doubles\" and he gave me a dirty look.  I was over it and just checked the bag to see if they were warm.  When I got home they were smothered with a ridiculous amount of mayo and biff sauce and didn't look all the way done.  Check your burgers before you leave or bite into one since this place can no longer be trusted.  Here's a tip for Biff, don't serve ice cream, fish sandwiches, wings, BBQ, etc. if you can't even handle a basic burger order.  You're welcome.",

They could have turned around from the cruising part one minute early and not had a delay at all but they might have missed an extra $1 from someone buying one bag of pretzels\n\nIf Lainey is in your boat I would recommend requesting a refund before you step foot on the boat",

I looked at the brochure and the pricing, I thought, looked reasonable.  When it was time to pay, however, I was irritated that the price was much higher.  When asked how they came up with the price, they pulled a different pricing list from behind the counter to explain.  This was not ok!!  Display your prices!!  \n\nAlso, during the manicure, the tech was answering texts and was gone for about 10 to 15 minutes.  This, I feel, was not very professional.  My daughter, also, explained to the tech that she had a bruise UNDER her nail.  The tech proceeded to file the nail and finally told my daughter she could not file the color out of her nail any more or she would put a hole in her nail!!  The bruise and color is UNDER the nail...think please!!\n\nLuckily we are out of town guests and will not be back here.",

Mostly, it was a complete waste of an hour, along with a $40+ charge. \n\nI have no idea if the wellness plan is a good deal or not, but I do know this place sells it HARD, and I do not want to sit through a sales pitch.

This led to 2 of the tennants in handcuffs and a completely ILLEGAL search of the entire apartment when they had no probable cause. It has gotten to the point where the security guards just harass the same apartment units when they have nothing better to do.

I ordered the the Tagliatelle Bolognese. The bolognese came with prime beef and Berkshire pork. The meat was too chunky for me and sadly, the sauce tasted the Ragu. The seasoning seemed right but maybe it was the tomatoes? The tagliatelle was also a little to thick. \n\nFor dessert I ordered the Chocolate Budino and it completely missed the mark.  The budino itself was grainy and there was barely any caramel sauce or it was too thin to notice.  I wish they did a salted caramel to bring out more of the caramel taste.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place if you're used to authentic Italian food.",

  "text": "So while staying at the new opal Sands Hotel we decided to venture across the street for breakfast. Please don't it was a huge mistake! After my wife receiving this horrible omelet for breakfast we decided to call it to the waitress attention that it was very dry and burnt. Egg should be yellow not brown or black in any manner. She immediately responded with well I can't take the whole thing off the bill they are expensive. Well we didn't win anything off the bill but maybe one that wasn't burnt would have been good. I told the waitress nevermind we just wanted to bring it to your attention that most people may not like burnt food.\n\nUltimately we didn't have anything taken off the bill but we would not return. The food was bad the service was worse. There were no redeeming qualities in the restaurant it was old and dated and combined with bad food and four waitresses who chatted with each other like they were mad at the world why return?\n\nDo yourself a favor find somewhere else to eat.",

French 75 cocktails were also very enjoyable. Steaks.. 4 ppl we tried several cuts. Two chose the filet, 1 bone in ribeye, and 1 dry aged ribeye. 2 were cooked medium and 2 requested med rare. Complaints were the same across the board, fairly dry, not very flavorful, not all that tender.  Sides we had brussel sprouts and Fleming's potatoes...both were average, forgettable. Very disappointing.",

  "text": "Save your time and money and DO NOT GO TO NTB. I went in on a Sunday for an oil change and was told I needed brakes and a filter. I replaced the filter that day and came back two days later for brakes. When the brakes were complete I was told that my water pump was leaking badly. I asked if it was that bad why wasn't that something they saw two days prior? They saw that I needed a filter but not that my water pump was leaking? They didn't have an answer for that. I was told that for my vehicle I also have to get a new time and chain. I asked for a printed out quote. Which I was not given at that time just told that it was over $1000. They suggested that I get a sealant that may work. I got the sealant and they put it in and told me that it did slow it down. I left and before I made it to my destination my car overheated. I brought it back and they put more coolant in it and told me they would look up another sealant that would work and would call me back. I waited a few hours and called them back and was placed on hold for 10 mins. I called back and an extremely moody manager answered. I asked if he was having a bad day and said that he was just frustrated. I'm the one that should be frustrated! I finally got a hold of the guy I was dealing with and told him I needed a quote. He said he would call me when he was done with it. I definitely wasn't about to wait on that again so I went up there. He quoted me around $1100 and told me it was about a 5 or 6 hour job. I asked if they could adjust the price since it was something major they had missed and my car was FINE before I took it to them. He said he would talk to the moody manager when he calmed down. Of course I never got a call back. I left a review and corporate contacted me saying they would do something to help and get the issue solved. They contacted the store and was told the amount of time it would take and that they could get it down to around $900. I was quoted $800 somewhere else and told them they should honor or beat that price. They said I should get a call from the store with a price. I get another call from corporate the next day where one person now tells me the location doesn't have the tools to do the work, which is a complete lie, and a corporate manager who says the district manager doesn't feel comfortable with the location doing the work all of a sudden. A mechanic at that location told me he had replaced a water pump and time and chain three times on a Charger but all of a sudden you don't feel comfortable doing it??? It was the worse experience I have ever had and I have been going to them for 12 years! Absolutely no point in corporate contacting me to hand me more bs and waste my time with excuses and lies. Don't waste yours! Go elsewhere for repairs!",

When I walked in, there were \"at least\" four employees within eyesight that saw me walk in but ignored me (one on their phone, one cleaning, one at register, and another I'm not sure ). It was not busy there were a couple people in seats as though they were waiting for someone and there (to the best of my knowledge) was only one person being serviced. I asked \"are you guys about to close?\" The guy looked up from his phone and said \"yea\" then went back to it. I know nail salons aren't known for their customer service but I was a bit surprised they weren't more friendly (I had in my mind this salon was going to be just awesome all around for some reason). As I walked it I noticed the door said they closed today at 7, so I went back in and asked about it. They guy looked up from his phone to say \"no 6\" then again went back to his phone. Overall I just feel they should practice better customer service and if their sign is wrong, they should change it or tell people. It really saddened me to know it won't be a place I regularly visit.",

Probably the best looking one I've gotten in the year+ that I've been getting dip manicures. \n\nThe next time I went was a totally different experience. The chick that did my nails was unprofessional. She left the foils on way too long and my cuticles were super dry afterwards. They don't need to be left on the entire length of a pedicure, especially since they use plastic gloves to heat the acetone. \n\nShe rushed my dip manicure and kept asking other nail techs if they would give her a manicure. She left while I was still drying at her station and started getting a manicure herself next to another tech! So there were 2 techs tied up giving 2 other techs manicures, 4 total employees! I've never ever ever seen a nail technician receive treatment while the salon was open, much less two at once. \n\nMy nails and cuticles look TERRIBLE.

  "text": "Erik Torres and Chad Zamora completely betrayed my trust and rolled out all the classic lies that give car salesmen a bad name. The first visit started with Erik showing my wife and I new and used Outbacks and ended with him giving us an invoice and a quote for our trade-in. All negotiations revolved around the invoice price. \n\nI called back a week later when he was busy, so he had his partner Chad call me back. After learning we were shopping around, Chad agreed to $6,000 for my trade-in. I emphasized I needed to agree on that price ahead of time as I had to tow the trade-in car from our home an hour from the dealership, and get childcare, to finalize the deal for a new Outback. After arriving at the dealership as promised, the story started to change. Suddenly there was a \"huge miscommunication\" and they were no longer able to agree to the $6,000 quote. Oh and by the way, they wanted to start negotiating from MSRP. \n\nI partly blame myself for not getting the deal in writing via email before arriving there. They knew I was jumping through hoops to get the deal done and were just using that leverage against me. They just had to get me in there and could then completely change the story. (I now understand why Eric Torres has worked for six dealerships in four years.) \n\nWe ended up walking away, selling our car to CarMax for $8,000 and buying our Outback from Gold Rush Subaru, which was a great experience.",

  "text": "I got married a month ago. I went to this locations out 6-8 months before the wedding and my experience started out ok. I had gone in 3 times to find my dress and each time I had an appointment, and each time I had to share the consultant. It didn't bother me too much but I thought it odd to have an appointment and still have to share. So I finally found a dress, the one I tried on was too big but they said in the right size with some altering it would fit where and how I wanted. They ordered the dress and it did come in early which was great. I asked when I should get it altered and they said there would be plenty of time and to bring it in ( this was January 18 my wedding was in March) Once I started dealing with the alterations department is when my experience went downhill. I went in to fit my dress. The lady was very nice, did my fitting and I went on my way. I didn't have any extensive alterations, a hem, bra cups, and I added some pretty straps. Fast forward to 3 days before my final fitting and when I was supposed to pick up my dress. I get a phone call saying that they pulled my dress out to alter it, and when they started the work somehow there were slash marks on my dress it must've been out while working on another dress and it got cut, and they couldn't fix it. They were going to have to get a new one (mind you this is now February 18th, my wedding was March 7th but it was an out of state wedding and I was leaving on the 3rd) she said they'd put a rush but I'd have to come in again for a new fitting. I was scheduled for a new fitting for the expected arrival time. The dress came in early which was nice but the alterations manager still wanted me to come in on the original date. She said and I quote \" We're so busy and booked we'll try and fit you in\". Excuse you???? This is not my fault and my wedding is only a couple weeks away and you are acting like you're doing me a favor by squeezing me in? Not to mention losing wages because I had to leave work early to make appointments that should've been taken care of already. I ended up getting in a day early but not by their insistence, but by mine. I went in and the lady was nice and did my fitting and I left. The next appointment to come in was a day BEFORE I left for my wedding. I went in with my sister who was picking her dress up. She was leaving later for the wedding so she had more time. We walked in and the alterations manager was there and she went on about how busy she was and how she was the only one there with all this work to be done and she had OTHER brides coming in and walk in pinnings to do. It made me feel like I wasn't worth the time and all those other brides were more important and that I should be sooo grateful that she was squeezing me in. That was the theme of my experience, we're squeezing you in so be happy, which was ridiculous since this whole thing WAS NOT MY FAULT. I tried the dress on and one of the bra cups was a third showing and the straps were gapping. I asked why the straps were not supporting anything and were falling off my shoulder, she said the the bodice is supposed to hold everything up and it wasn't the straps job, it is the straps job to stay on my shoulders though....whatever. She had to alter it so she said we'd have to wait. I asked her how long  and she said, again, that her next fitting with another bride was at 630 it was 430. So my sister and I had to wait around for 2 hours. We finally came back and when we walked in she asked did you want to try it on again?? I said uh yes, I'd like to make sure it fits. I tried it on and it was better and so I took the dress home, but I had a sad feeling about how everything went. It was an added stress that I didn't need and didn't deserve.\n\n\n\n***Update***\nI did end up emailing the lady from David's bridal from the comment below on April 16th and received absolutely no answer back. I think they post that response to make it look like they try to make it better or actually care but they don't. Just another disappointment from David's Bridal!",

These boxes were on the bottom or just thrown in some random place. If they had not been packed so well by my wife, All of the things would have been destroyed,but instead, some of them.

  "text": "I don't usually get my nails done, but I figured it was time to treat myself. Found this place through yelp and the reviews/pictures pulled me in. I made an appointment for a regular nail polish. When I came in, they immediately seated me. And before I chose a color, I wanted to make sure I was getting regular nail polish, for which the lady nodded her head and said yes. It wasn't until they put my hands under the UV that I realized it was gel. By the end of it, they charged me $30 and assured me it would last 2-3 weeks, which was fine by me because, as I've mentioned, I don't usually get my nails done. My nails were a pretty pink/nude and I was happy with it for pretty much 5 days until it started to chip. I called them the next day and with no problem, the lady on the phone (Coco?) told me to come back and they'd re-do the chipped nails. \n\nSo I come back about 1.5 weeks after my first appointment and again, they seated me immediately. They decided that they only needed to work on my right hand, and the middle finger on my left hand. They sanded and buffed out the gel, but I noticed they didn't use any nail polish remover. They applied the new polish and within 30 minutes, I was good to go. You could tell one hand looked brighter than the other, but it was also bumpier because they just slapped on new nail polish over the old one. Literally one day later, the new polish chipped on my thumb, and you could see the old nail polish. On top of that, the nails that were colored from the first time started chipping too. \n\nI was honestly hoping the nails would last for at least 2 weeks, especially having gone TWICE. I have only done gel polish once before, but they definitely lasted longer than this. I gave them 2 stars for their immediate response, and their attempt to re-doing my nails. But the quality and the shoddy-attempt to fix it are why it's only 2 stars.",

Second of all, I told the guy he was a service animal and he said and I quote, \"we don't allow all service animals, for example, emotional support animals\". This isn't just illegal, it is absurd.

Our total wait was 1 hour and 20 mins, when we got sat service was quick and efficient. We ordered chips and salsa, chips were store bought and ok. I ordered a bbq beef sandwich which was ok, the corn on the cob that came with was cold, table bread was something worse than wonder bread with good butter. My husband ordered the Top Sirloin, he asked for medium but got rare. He isnt one to send something back so he ate it, shortly figured out it was mostly unedible since it was all fat.

Started flipping through the drink menu and noticed there was just wine. Asked our waitress- who seemed less than thrilled to be there- if there was a beer list and she informed us that there were pages missing from the menu we had- she brought us a new one.\nMy husband and I both ordered the blood orange IPA. The waitress left and 5 mins later came back to tell us that they were tapping a new keg and it would be a few mins. No problem. Came back 5 mins later and said they were having trouble finding the keg. I ordered a new beer- Wicked Weed sour, only to find out that they were out of that one too. I decided to not have a beverage. Later I noticed all of these yummy mixed drinks being ordered at tables around us-- our menus must have been missing the mixed drinks page, too. \nI ordered a bowl that included root veggies and eggs. Decided to pay the extra and get seitan added. Found out they were out of that, too. Clearly some restocking issues. Received my bowl. Not bad. It was supposed to come with an herb hollandaise but of course mine didn't have it.\nTold our waiter and she told the manager and came back to our table to say, \"it should be on the bottom\". Well, it wasn't... but I don't understand why it had to be questioned. \nOverall the food was okay. The service was mediocre and they clearly need to update their menus. It's really disappointing to go somewhere and be out of nearly everything you order. We won't be back.",

This Marriott has been in operation since at least my grade school days--over 40 years ago.  Great location, cute elevator system, valet only parking at $42 per day, and a nice expansive lobby area. I'm not sure the \"upgrade\" to club level is worth it though.  The M Club is certainly an interesting concept, but a trip to the gift shop is in your future if you count on a late night trip to the M Club to satisfy your craving you will be disappointed.  Also you should  plan on bringing your own phone charger--three out of 4 usb room chargers did not work. \n\nOver all I would suggest  if you visit during a special event--in our case a Saints game and the Sugar Bowl NCAAF bowl game--be prepared to pay $$$ more than you'd expect for a similar moderate hotel.\n\nLocated walking distance from Quarter, Bourbon Street, Riverwalk, Convention Center, Harrah's Casino.",

The massage was fine but nothing out of the ordinary.  I would be willing to try other therapists that would be more my style if it weren't for my experience in the waiting room. \n\nI got to massage about 15 minutes before my massage. When I got there the receptionist was on the phone.  I hadn't been there in a while so she asked me to fill out the paperwork again. However she said to the person on the phone \"one sec\" then ask me to fill out the papers and get right back on the phone. Then again asking me to select my music with \"one sec\" and right back on the phone with what clearly sounded like a social conversation. Then back on the phone, stops again with her \"one sec\" and says to me \"it's 11:50 you're like super early will it be okay if you're therapist is a few minutes late?\"  Super early wtf my appt is at 12.   I confirm the appt time with her and say that it's fine. \n\nShe gets back on the phone then steps out into the hallway. I can still hear the entire conversation and at this point it is escalating and she is cursing and screaming. This goes on for a while and then she comes back in says bye (insert diminutive) and sits down and then pleasantly asks me if I want a water as if nothing happened and she hadn't been ignoring me for 15 minutes. \n\nThe massage therapist apologized for being a few minutes late and I told her I wasn't worried about that but the receptionist was incredibly unprofessional. She apologized and said she was actually a GENERAL MANAGER. Needless to say if this is how they run their business I'm not going back.  I know it's not a super fancy salon but I could get better service across the street at rite aid!\n\nAnd surprise surprise miss unprofessional didn't even apologize to me for her behavior.",

Thursday March 29, 2018 I asked my husband to meet me at Miller's to try their Prime Rib Special. He arrived before me and went to the bar to order me a Lemon Drop Martini. When I got to the restaurant our seat was ready and he gave me my drink. I asked him where was the rest of the drink because it looked like 3 big sips were missing simply because going there for 9 years I have NEVER had a martini that was not filled to the rim. I went to the bar to ask for my alcohol in the glass because it was no way that a drink of that size should have not been served. The bar girl had an attitude and I saw when she threw the drink out and made another drink. She brought the complaint to the Managers attention (older white man with glasses) and he came back with the second glass of my lemon drop that still wasn't full. He asked with the half glass of martini in his hand,\" Do you have a problem with this drink?\" I immediately asked for my money back because as the Manager he had no intention to accommodate me in no way and I knew he was going to say something like the alcohol is measured. He offered absolutely NOTHING to help me be happy! After a long day of work and I talked about going to this establishment afterwards, I was so disappointed and especially because I also work in a customer driven environment, I should have not been treated this way.

After the second no-show in as many months, I fired them.  The first no-show was the initial cleaning.  Ok, things happen.  There was a call and no message the day before and the day of the 2nd no-show.  When I called to inquire why no one showed, the woman who answered  didn't know who I was, insisted that they left a message, although she had no idea what the message might have said and speculated, \"Maybe they came to your house and couldn't get in.\"  There was no, \"I'll follow up to see what happened.\"  There was no apology, no \"how can I make this right.\"  This company is completely disorganized and unprofessional.",

  "text": "I was excited to see this establishment re-open so quickly after it closed under a different business name. The long and short is that I was served the worst breakfast I had ever gotten in my entire life. Parts of the signature dish \"farmers breakfast\" were missing completely. ( the potato cakes specifically ) on top of the fact that biscuits and gravy generally come with 2 standard 3\"-3.5\" round biscuits split equaling 4 pieces.. this plate served 1 dried out husk the size of a half dollar.. The gravy tasted like they had poured a few cups of flour and water in it to stretch the volume.. the mixture tasted like starch and nothing else, they also forgot the side I ordered, which I had to request. The scrambled eggs were standard but entirely forgettable, and presented in a very sloppy manner. Extremely disappointing and sad,  I left hungry and confused because i literally was not served the full meal i had ordered. My date was happy with her waffle - the coffee was decent. Likely will not return, but I do wish them good luck.",

Our family has been going to this location for some time now and the service has been disappointing lately. First of all, as a customer, I do not care if you are having a bad day- I don't deserve your attitude. Secondly, if the app is not functioning properly, it is not our fault that machines have glitches. Don't give me an attitude saying I came at the wrong time to pick up my food because your system failed you and not even apologize. Lastly, be consistent with the amount of food I receive. I'm paying for a large and my bowl if half-filled. As I mentioned before, I've been going there for a while now so I know what a large should look like. \n\nHopefully, you will be able to treat other customers with some respect after reading this.",

First off they rushed my food for maybe the 100th but this time the presentation of my food just couldn't be ignored. I asked if they can take the sushi back and fix it and the bartender flipped out and  argued with me to tell me how she wouldn't serve me anymore if I ever come back etc etc. WOW ! sorry geisha but I don't eat slop.

However, the woman who runs the smoothie food truck is dishonest and not to be trusted.  My sister and I ordered 2 large smoothies, @$10.  I gave my sister a $50 bill to pay the $20 owed. I went to the restroom. When I returned my sister was quite upset.  The owner took the $50, gave her the smoothies and no change.  When my sister asked for $30 change she said she only gave her a $20.  When I approached I noticed the proprietor peeking out to see if my sister was gone.  When I approached and requested the change she came out and started shouting \"Your calling me a liar and a thief\".  She was very unprofessional and seemed a bit high.  Rather than arguing anymore we wished her good karma and left.  I'd like to add the smoothies tasted like wash water.  I will return to capture a picture of the dishonest vendor and her products.

  "text": "As an elder care attorney, representing victims of abuse, I was shocked by the rude and condescending behavior inflicted upon me and my elderly guest, whom I was treating to a birthday brunch at this establishment. My guest wanted to order a specialty omelette, which included ingredients that are basic to many omelettes, tomato and peppers. The server informed us that those items were out of season and unavailable. I expressed my surprise, with a smile, that there was no way to get tomatoes or peppers of good quality when this place specializes in omelettes to order. I was a bit taken aback by the server's  rudeness in delivering this information, especially when I could see that berries and avocados were being served and they are also out of season! Apparently this caused our server to say something unkind about us to the manager who then proceeded to come over and berate us and make a scene. I was astounded and calmly expressed my dismay at her behavior toward customers. Food was good, no issue with the chef; but the atmosphere was noisy and lacking comfort. The service was undoubtedly deplorable. So much misery was inflicted on me and my guest for requesting tomatoes and peppers that it's unconscionable.  When the manager marched over she announced that she heard we had an issue. I told her we were surprised that tomatoes and peppers were unavailable...that's it. She then proceeded to go off on a tangent and jump down my throat, behaving so unprofessionally that I was shocked. This manager continued to attack me by coming back to our table a second and 3rd time, continuing her outrage by throwing down a phone number and telling me to call the owner, storming off in fury. It was a shocking thing to witness! Needless to say I will never come here again or recommend it to anyone! I believe the owner would fire her on the spot if she had seen how this woman treated her customers, as well as the male server who must've said something horrific to cause this incident to begin with. My final comment was that tomatoes and peppers may be out of season, but so are the berries and avocados they were serving, and I didn't know why she was attacking customers! I was trying to protect my guest from feeling put-down and embarrassed. My guest is nearly 80 years old and I am 60; I did not ask to speak with the owner or for the owners phone number. If you believe the customer should come first and deserves to be treated well and to have an enjoyable experience at a dining establishment then do not waste your time at this place. Apparently respect for elders and common courtesy in a service-oriented business is not part of this place's training. I apologized to my guest when we left and tried to keep it light, but I could see that she was hurt and embarrassed. Her words to me expressed her dismay about how we were treated and I felt it absolutely necessary to leave this review.",

This review has nothing to do with their hospitality.  I've stayed at other Indigo's across the US, and all of those experiences were great. This particular hotel, though, is just simply to \"compact\" for a comfortable stay.  Feels like they tried to fit too many rooms into the building they renovated.  Each room will fit 1 individual with no issues, however for anyone planning to stay here with a partner or significant other, the rooms  will likely be too small (especially if one of you is over 6 feet tall).  The showers are very \"economical\" in terms of space saving, and there is just no way 2 people can fit into the bathroom at the same time.",

We have been here a few times and is usually busy but service is good...food is typical bar fare which is sometimes just what you want. Today was pleasantly surprised to see it was not busy...lots of empty tables inside. But that was where the pleasant ended. Our waitress was ....just not there......????\nWe ordered beer and a few appetizers. The beers eventually arrived and were leisurely finished.....no waitress......food arrived but was difficult to eat wings with nothing to drink (had not been offered water). After waiting and looking around (and never laying eyes on her) for another 10 minutes we flagged down another waitress and asked if she could find our waitress....she said sure and asked if she could bring us anything....we asked for water and a refill on the beer. Our waitress suddenly appeared and put a water in front of me (one water.....none for the other person)....no words; turned and walked away. We shared the water..... the beer didn't show up until we were done eating.....I had to ask for the check.....incidentally the other wait staff were hustling to and from their tables....just not ours. \nIf it was busy I might understand but it was not...not sure what the problem was but not worth over $70 for two people for 2 beers and appetizers and service not worthy of the stop in. Will be back sometime but not soon....maybe after staff has a turn over.",

Hella weird I have never been treated so poorly in a Costco I travel a lot for work and spend a lot of money at Costco.

Horrible Customer Service!!!\n\nChecked-in and  i was told that i was confirmed on my Choice Privileges Points.\n\nOn check-out,  I requested a receipt for my business travel. The clerk quickly told me NO. He said I needed to get it from my 3rd party EXPEDIA agency. I then tried to verify I got my Points for Choice Privelegies and he said I would NOT get them because I used a 3rd party agency.  (Extremely Rude)\n\nAs for the the other desk clerks, they were self absorbed in their tasks at the front desk abd did not pay attention to the customers. One clerk just watched TV on his phone and had turned the volume down on the TV in the dining room area for breakfast.\n\n2. Breakfast was recycled and NOT fresh.\n3. Orange juice dispenser was out of date and tasted bad. The attendant installed 1 or 2 more bags of concentrated orange juice and tested them. she subsequently pulled those out to until she got one that did not dispense bad orange juice.\n4. Hotel room in dis-repair. Shower curtain rod was sagging and appeared to be broken on one side.\n\nToilet handle was broken.\n\nTook several times to flush the toilet.\n\nWater pressure was horrible for the toilet and shower.\n\nHotel room door was NOT square and subseequently would NOT shut good.\n\n5. Room cleaning service did not make the bed one day. Also they kept on turning my room lights off after cleaning. I would leave a room light on because it was dark when I would return from work.",

  "text": "if i could give negative stars, i would! let me start off saying that i have used this location many times prior to send packages out and never encountered a problem until the past 2 weeks. \n\ni had 2 packages with pre-paid return labels to be sent out to 2 different places. The employee scanned them for me, printed out my receipt for the packages being dropped off. They were printed labels and told me he will tape them onto my 2 packages to be sent out. The employee made a mistake and switched the labels and they were sent to the wrong places.\n\n1 package was found and is currently being sent back to me, the other has not been found which costs over $100. The claim has finally been filed today after 2 managers and the owner have given me the round around. (had to contact both companies, and 2 different UPS reps multiple times because store would not)\n\nMy main issues are: the employee does not seem like he is owning up his mistake, 1 manager was away for the weekend and said he will call me back after speaking with him and never did. The other manager kept implying there is nothing they can do and did nothing to help resolve the issues. THE OWNER \"Ray\" (if thats his real name he gave me) called me with a restricted blocked number, told me it is MY FAULT that the packages were sent to the wrong locations because i did not place the labels on them myself (their employee is the one who offered to place the labels on for me). He does not want to take responsibility of his employee that made the mistake, nor did he try to help resolve the issues. He was very rude, loud, and disrespectful with his voice over the phone which is totally unacceptable and bad business. \n\nA rep from one of the companies that my package was supposed to be sent to was on the phone with me while the manager from this store was not trying to help resolve any issues. \n\nSmall business franchise for UPS needs guidance by some real UPS reps. Will never use this location ever again and hopefully my claims will get resolved and i wont be stuck paying out of pocket for THEIR negligence.",

  "text": "{Update #3} \nIt seems to me that you only like it when you guys receive positive reviews. You and your staff are not able to handle when someone is telling you that they were treated poorly and didn't like the service. This is business 101. You and your staff should figure out where you guys dropped the ball instead of putting energy into going back-and-forth with me on a public platform. You should probably invest that energy into making sure that unfortunate things like this don't happen again. I would not recommend this place to an enemy. We did not deserve that treatment, and the fact that you're trying to justify it reflects poorly on you. Learn how to take criticism and charge the issues instead of arguing with multiple customers on your short comings. You failed as a leader because you are not  people directing your team, instead you are telling them that customer are not always right. But what can I expect when their leader does not know leadership. I would not advise anyone to visit this restaurant because of the lack of compassion that was given from the owner or co-owner of this establishment. There is no need to try to win me back over as I am already done. Again I do not want or need your apology, but you should do better for the sake of the business and not desire treat them in the manner that you have. \n\n{Update #2} \nI just received a private message from the \"co-owner\" of this establishment which definitely shed a ton of light on the situation that happened. If the leader does not practice good customer service then the staff WILL NOT!! This makes so much sense because we were treated horribly by the staff here and nothing was being done about it. But this message I was just sent from the co-owner explains why. She does not take pride in serving others so why should the staff. Horrible and sad! She has fallen as a leader. \n\n      -Response: \"I was out of town when you visited our restaurant. My response was not rushed as I waited until after speaking to all employees involved. \n\nI did not blame you 'just for coming to the establishment' but simply explained the situation to you in it's entirety. \n\nI am quite aware of what customer service is and should be. My staff does as well. We aren't always perfect, but that's because we're human.\n\nI do not promote a 'customer is always right' mentality because, simply put, they aren't. Customers are human too. Clearly mistakes were made in this situation by guests and staff and for that we apologize.\n\nEnjoy your Sunday,\nMaria\"\n\n{Update} \nI really appreciate your urgency to respond to this negative rating. However, the treatment we received was UNACCEPTABLE and that same urgency should been extended then! I appreciate that you pointed out that my replacement food was free and you hoped I enjoyed it, as I did not even eat it because it became cold as I'm trying to deal with rudeness and unprofessionalism for the staff. Forget the food, I'm just trying to get comfortable at this point. So if you're the \"co-owner\" then you should know a thing or two about decent customer service and leadership and should have lead your team on how to properly handle situations like this instead of blaming us just for coming to the establishment. I would recommend sitting down with your team and using this situation as a teaching tool on what NOT to do to your customers who thought well enough of this place to have our girls gathering there. This was heartbreaking to say the least. I don't need your apologies, just do better as a leader.",

This place has a pattern of violence and negligence with their staff.  This is my sister-in-law and brother's story from the original Round Up:  \n\nThis is the same as \"Round Up\" Tampa. Same staff, same owners, they just moved to a different storefront.\n\nI went to the Round Up for my birthday. I was walking to the Tiki Bar with my boyfriend, and one of the bouncers slid his hand up the back of my shorts, in an attempt to grab my butt. He was a big guy, I would estimate he weighed as much if not more than my boyfriend and I combined. My boyfriend asked him (calmly, with no threats) to apologize. Instead of apologizing, the bouncer and 2 of his bouncer friends beat him continuously. They punched him, bodyslammed him, kicked him, stomped on him, and pummeled him, putting him in the hospital.  He now has permanent injuries that he will have to deal with for the rest of his life. Anyone who tried to help was restrained by other bouncers. My boyfriend was dragged out (literally), and I followed. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, the owner came  out. He was extremely rude and unhelpful, and threatened to have me thrown in jail for speaking against him. This is the same man that owns the \"new\" location.\n\nIf anyone doesn't believe the story, please let me know and I can furnish you with the police report and ambulance report from that night.",

  "text": "Is it clean? Yes. Is it in a great location? Yes. Is the shuttle service accommodating? It depends. You might need to walk a little to your destination. Is an Uber or Lyft quicker? Yes. Does this hotel charge you to park your car? Yes. Do they have continental breakfast? No. \n\nSo you a probably wondering why I gave them a one star rating, right? Truthfully, if I could leave this place 0 stars I would. The only thing they have going for them is the live music downstairs at the commodore. And I can't forget to add how friendly and helpful our shuttle guy Josh was. He's the only good shuttle guy they have. The cleanliness and location are great as well, but that isn't enough to have me running back here. \n\nI am quite surprised that no one has really commented on how paper thin these walls are. Thin enough to hear full blown conversations. I've stayed at plenty of hotels and never once have I experienced one as nearly as loud as this. It sounded like people were at one point tossing furniture around. To top it off, it wasn't just the one room beside us it was both. \n\nThe bathrooms are small and the showers have barely anywhere to put your toiletries. Make sure you check your bill too. My mom was quoted one price on the phone when she booked it and was never sent a confirmation number. Then when we arrived the person at the front desk tried saying it was going to be over $800 for 3 nights. That wasn't what my mom was quoted. Upon checkout, my mom reviewed the itemized bill only to find a charge for overnight parking when we never parked overnight. We rented a card for 1 day and were charged the $12 daytime fee on top of the $22 overnight fee. Review your bill always. I would never recommend this hotel and the next time I come to Nashville I will be staying somewhere nicer.",
