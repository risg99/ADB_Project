  "text": "After nearly 6 years of having an EWC wax pass, I've finally decided to not renew. The services themselves are just fine and generally  pretty well done.\nThe sales pitch and upsell for products that begins about midwax is the element that has pushed me over the edge to discontinue. I am uncomfortable because of the push. One waxer walked out to the product wall and took a product down and placed it with the receptionist while talking, indicating that I would be buying. Um, no. \n\nCouple that with the what seems like an endless rotation of staff at the front desk that leaves for some serious disorganization at any point (I received 5 phone calls about reminders for the same appointment in the duration of 24 hours. 3 calls from the same person, same message. WTH?).\n\nGoodbye, EWC.",

  "text": "My daughter got a little confused and thought she was buying Imagine Dragon tickets for West Palm Beach but instead she purchased in Tampa. She managed to get us floor so we decided to keep them and take a road trip. Since we had floor and it's first come first serve we came very early to make sure we got to the front of the line. Unfortunately for us we stood in the wrong line for a really long time. By the time we figured out what was going on we were in the back of the line of people heading to the floor. They handed out wrist bands to signify who got to be on the floor. That part was great but better signs marking the respective lines would have been helpful. Security was pretty quick but I never bring anything in with me except one credit card, my phone, and a car key. \n\nOnce inside things worked out better. We managed to find a spot along the rail and began what had to be the hottest night of my life. It was so hot that I felt dizzy at times. They sold expensive but necessary frozen lemonade on the floor which saved me. It was cash only which forced a necessary trip to the expensive cash machine. \n\nThe show was amazing. We were so close to the band and they dropped balloons and shot out confetti several times during the show. This was the most civilized crowd I have ever been in. No one pushed or tried to cut in front of me. We all just danced and had the best time. In Broward it is a fight to keep your spot. I loved the show and it made all of the uncomfortable standing and heat worth it. \n\nAfter the show arena attendants were rude about patrons leaving. I sat down for a minute to catch my breath after standing for four hours in extreme heat and I was screamed at. Since we came early we were in the front of the parking lot. Leaving was another nightmare. No one moved around us for over an hour. We were completely stuck. Parking attendants to direct traffic would have been appreciated. The concert let out at 11 and we didn't get on the road until well after 12 AM. If I came back I would take Brett M.'s advice about parking at the exit and taking a long walk to the entrance in order to be able to leave. \n\nI think how much you enjoy your show at this arena depends on the weather. This arena has covered seating but it is open on the sides with lawn seating. If there is lightening in the area they will stop the show or cut it short. That is what happened to us the night before in Palm Beach. The finale was changed to acoustic because of bad weather as people were forced out of the arena. I am so happy we decided to keep the Tampa tickets where we saw the full ending of the concert. It seems easier to get good tickets here as opposed to more populated Broward County and my daughter lives in Orlando so I may be back.",

  "text": "On a quick weekend trip to Nashville, I almost forgot to visit the Country Music Hall of Fame & Museum! I am so glad that I was able to get in a visit before heading to the airport!  \n\nFirst - it is a gorgeous building, outside and inside the lobby.  It's very well designed, with soaring ceilings and windows in the front, and beautiful wood floors.  There is a sweeping staircase and elevators.  The walls are covered with awards and names of musicians.\n\nNo, wait - for real first off - everyone is really friendly here.  The ladies at the ticket counter, the folks at the coat check (complimentary!) and the young man at the beverage kiosk.  All super nice. \n\nThe place is CLEAN.  The floors - whether stone, cement, wood or carpet - all clean.  Walls and windows - clean.  Sparkling.  They are paying attention to this - there was not a speck of litter anywhere.  The cases around the exhibits were crystal clean - and I didn't see people pushing their fingers up against them and getting them all dirty.\n\nThere are plenty of \"hands on\" kinds of exhibits for listening to music and getting information but so much of the visual part of the museum is composed of clothing.  The place is full of headless mannequins wearing the most amazing array of outfits I never did see in my life.  I have to confess - I love the costume exhibits at the local art museums in San Francisco - and this really made the museum compelling for me.  All the outfits are properly fitted on mannequins which stand at the size/height of the original wearer of the item -- so it gives you a sense of how big and tiny some of these folks were (Loretta Lynn was tinytinytiny!).  \n\nThere were so many great artifacts there, in addition to outfits there were instruments, automobiles and many other things.  I would definitely return and would love to attend a special event there.  My mom was very jealous.",

  "text": "I was lucky enough to go on a private tour on a Saturday afternoon with a few friends. Co-owner Andrew was our guide and he did a fantastic job telling us all about the rum making process and explained everything in an easy-to-understand manner. Roulaison is a small and new rum distilling company and, I'll be honest, I know nothing about liquor production. Everything here is handcrafted and it's all local. All of this was pretty new to me, but I found the tour very interesting and Andrew was extremely nice and was happy to answer questions.\n\nAfter the tour came the tasting and I'm not a liquor drinker, so this got real interesting. I can usually handle liquor if it's mixed with something, so I was thankful for the teeniest little thimble full of samples that we had to try. Some of the rum burned, but that's probably because I \"can't hang\". By the third taste I had to reach for water- I'm such a lightweight. I did, however, really enjoy the rum liqueur that was offered, mainly because it had some sweetness to it. You can actually have them mix you up a cocktail, if that's your thing.\n\nI highly recommend the tour, especially if you like learning about new things and how things are made.",

  "text": "Tang Bistro's been on my radar ever since it first opened. A lot of Northern Chinese spots seem to have opened up recently (South Silk Road, Blossom Northern China Cuisine and Chinese Crepe). TB specializes in Xi'an cuisine.\n\nWe came on a Tuesday evening and the place was half full. The inside is quite spacious and even has a patio facing out onto 109 Street (after all, it housed Urban Diner). The menu is beautifully done and more upscale than your normal Northern Chinese spot.\n\n- Liang-pi (cold noodles) ($7.50) - crap, I didn't realize that you had the option of getting this non-spicy, mild, medium or intense! Would love to see how \"intense\" it really gets. The cold noodles had a chewy, slippery bite. Comes with the usual bean sprouts, julienne cucumbers and spongy gluten. Good but I prefer Noodle Feast's version.\n- Cucumber salad with garlic sauce ($6.50) - the cucumbers had a satisfyingly crunchy bite. The vinegar/garlic sauce was bright and refreshing. Would get this again.\n- Spicy pig ears ($9.50) - the spicy pig ears had a tasty chili oil sauce. Great texture but the portion was pretty small for the price. CC thought it came in a \"ear shaped\" bowl.\n- Scramble egg & tomato ($10.50) with hand pulled noodles ($2.00) - the hand pulled noodles had a great chewy toothsome bite to them and the egg & tomato sauce worked well with the noodles. The combo felt like you were eating Italian with an Asian spin to it. The egg reminded me some sort of delicious cheese. I know that sounds weird but it was good.\n\nThe dishes are a bit on the oily side of things but everything was solid. Will be back to try more dishes. 3.5 stars.",

This lovely pastel colored, open air space is exactly what the area needed and where many will, and should be flocking to this summer. \n\nThe tunes were bumping, thanks to a solid dj. The kids were playing in modern formations and on rocking horses. The doggies were wagging their tails, as they're welcome here, and folks were grabbing drinks from various shops shaped like cargo shipping boxes! Way cool! They included a Tiki bar, Craft Cocktail Concepts by Blume, Urban Village Brewing and more! Think anything from exclusive IPAs on draft to Frose' (frozen rose') and sangria. A lil something for everyone! \n\nAll were enjoying the sunshine and good vibes.\n\nThere's a decent variety of food...Mama Maria's Italian Ice, Urban Empanada Box, Passyunk's own Essen Bakery, Tokai for vegan French Toast and bacon a la cart, Bru, Lil Sum Sum for dim sum and Spread Bagelry. \n\nThere are some shadier areas and pretty textured white umbrellas. There are also really cool modern seating options. \n\nThere are light strands, cut out iron lamp poles and marquee lights on the shops for at night. \n\nThere's also a stage! I can't wait to see who performs! \n\nThere's giant wooden Jenga and a neat viewing platform. \n\nThere's even a toy store with bubbles and chalk to keep your kiddos busy. \n\nIt's definitely a unique space I'm thrilled to see! It's so nice to have a reason to come back to this area again!!\n\nOh, and the friendly looking robot statue named Bebot, who was originally created for Burning Man at the entrance, is so fun! \n\nDog park, large kids' space and nursing areas to come...\n\n*As of Monday June 10th, the parking lot to the left of the entrance will have FREE parking with validation from any of the shops!\n\n**Restroom are air-conditioned trailers in the rear of the park.",

  "text": "Wonderful option for healthier yet tasty pizzas. Their pizzas are like flat bread style and for those who are gluten sensitive, then this is your place.  We had a gluten free pizza, and wanted something different. We had prociutto, fig spread and cheese on our pizza. It was very tasty.  A personal pizza is a good size for two people so that you can save room for their amazing nutella dessert pizza. Their prices are even better when you go on creative loafing and get a gift certificate there. Can you believe our bill came out to 1.50. Yes I swear, it was awesome.\nParking is not the greatest in Downtown Tampa. I really don't like driving around the area, but you will end up paying a small price on the meter.  \nYou can sit outside and enjoy fresh air since the outside is mostly shaded, as well as bring your dog. \nIt was definitely a great afternoon. Would be back again. This is my first try at this location, but I have been to the Westchase location which is even nicer. But they both are as equally tasty.",

  "text": "Damn. This place rocked my world. If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with Chinese food. \n\nIt was busy on a Saturday night, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table for 4. The table ordered: mala chicken, moo shu pork, shrimp with snow peas and mushrooms, and hunan tofu. I only tried the chicken and pork, but both of the other dishes looked amazing, got rave reviews, and the plates were all clean by the end. I could see that the shrimp was cooked to absolute perfection.\n\nNext time I go back (oh, there WILL BE a next time, for sure) it will be really hard not to get the mala chicken again. Menu listed it as very spicy, and while it had a kick it definitely wasn't Han Dynasty spicy. The morsels of chicken were so tender and fried beautifully - there was a very light coating that provided just enough crispness. The sauce was surprisingly complex, with notes of sichuan peppercorn, black vinegar, honey, garlic, and chiles. The portion was quite large but I ended up eating it all. Well, F kept stealing pieces but I guess I did offer to share both dishes we ordered... Next time he's getting his own.\n\nThe moo shu pork was OK, but moo shu isn't really my thing. I will say it's by far the best moo shu I've had on a very short list. Loved the seaweed (?) and glass noodles; it was very fresh-tasting.\n\nHousemade pickles to start and chocolate-dipped fortune cookies with orange wedges at the end. What could be better? Some reviewers have complained about the portion sizes but I thought they were a reasonable size. You're not getting two pounds of food like at a cheap Chinese takeout joint, but the food is infinitely better, fresher, and made with higher quality ingredients. Worth paying a few extra dollars for.\n\nDinner entrees are a bit pricey for typical Chinese food, but on par with what you might see at the local Thai places ($14-$17 per entree). Certainly still affordable by Main Line standards!",

  "text": "Having moved out here from the West Coast and having lived in the Pacific Northwest, my preference for Dungeness crab over teeny tiny blue crabs found here is a cause for sadness since they are so hard to find and can be expensive.\n\nThen I discovered that Marco's occasionally holds $35 AYCE Dungeness crab nights!  Hold your horses, make a reservation and head on over.\n\nFirst, to be honest, the atmosphere is just OK. When we first walked in, it felt like we were walking into a funeral home. It was dark and very dated.\n\nThe $35 dinner included fries and garlic bread. We told the server no fries for us please (more room for the crab!). They forgot and brought over fries anyway. They took them away. I ordered their version of an iced tea. I don't know what they brought over, but it wasn't an iced tea. Then they brought out the garlic bread, which unfortunately tasted stale and had very little flavor.  After a bite or two, we decided to pass on that too.\n\nFinally, the crab!  You can start with a plate with 2 large crabs, cleaned and split into two. You have a choice of Old Bay, garlic or plain. I started with Old Bay for the first found, but it was too salty for me. Next two rounds were plain. All the crab was juicy and meaty and sweet - just what I was looking for.\n\nThey do provide crab crackers, but to get the most meat, I highly recommend bringing your own seafood picks and.... my secret weapon... tiny sharp scissors!  Easier to cut through the legs where the shell is thin and you can get out a perfectly unmolested lump of meat that way.",

I like the most is their eye glass center, you can get good pair of glass with lesser price with insurance cover.

There are enough tables that you don't have to be by the front door where you'd constantly be looking up when someone comes in and possibly seeing someone you know with the obligation to chat. And there is a back door that you can escape out of. \n\nMy only problem is the chairs are a little tough on my boney butt, but I think that's a personal problem.

Now you could do the fancy brunch buffets, or pick the perfect patio to while away the day, or you could get right down to business and cure what ails ya with some serious food, like the brunch slice at Noble Pie! \n\nThis piece of pizza is nothing to muck with! They top a large slice with their creamy and garlicky bianco Base, a light layer of mozz, prosciutto, sun-dried tomato, asparagus, and red onion, and then top it with spicy hollandaise and... wait for it... a FARM FRESH EGG! As soon as it arrives you've gotta slather that ooey gooey egg yolk all over the slice and enjoy. The flavor combo is dy-no-mite and it's the perfect piece to put that hangover out to pasture! \n\nOn top of that beauty, Noble also rocks a full brunch menu with calzomelettes, sourdough toasts with eggs, cheese, and fresh veggies, a BYO Blood Mary and Bottomless Mimosas, and a full cocktail menu, all served up in a chillaxed atmosphere! Oh yeah, they also have gluten free crust and are happy to accommodate any special requests you might have.\n\nNoble is an awesome addition to downtown Reno and a stop worth making for brunch, lunch or dinner.

It seems like most of Chestnut Hill has stopped in to take a look and of course do some food shopping....especially after the blizzard on the weekend.  Like the other Fresh Markets I have been in, this is an extremely attractive store. The food exhibits are very well done....everything looks so fresh and new.  The store is on the smallish side for a supermarket these days but it is of course much larger than a specialty food shop.  Right now there are a lot of tasting stations throughout the store.  I don't think most of these will continue after the grand opening weeks ... but they do add a friendly touch.  There is one big drawback here and that is the prices.  They are def very high.  Maybe these prices will fit in perfectly with many shoppers from well-heeled Chestnut Hill ... but I can't see a lot of other people using this market for more than the occasional specialty item and continuing to do their regular grocery shopping elsewhere.",

Inspection and cleaning services are free here.\n\nI am not certain how long he has been at this particular location, which is at the very back of what looks like apartments converted into small businesses. Protip: Do not park in that tiny lot off of Broadway Boulevard. Go to the back and you will find ample parking. \n\n\nApparently, Eddie has been in the business for more than three decades. He was born and raised here, and also trained in his craft in Tucson by his father! Pretty cool. And there were a couple of things in there that I imagined hadn't been touched or moved since they had been placed.\n\nI arrived with my Citizen watch, one that I've had for 10 years. This watch is very dear and quite special to me. Of all of my possessions, it is among my most protected, actually because it was such a special gift.\n\nI had to leave it with Eddie because it has a highly specialized battery, which he had to track down. Turns out he ended up having it shipped directly from Japan. He and I had never met, and I didn't want to leave the watch. \n\nBut I could tell from his eyes and energy that I could trust him. It was automatic. I rarely feel this way about a person on a first meeting, so I left the watch behind.\n\nThe watch was ready after a week. Took a bit longer than expected, but Eddie was very communicative, sending me text messages along the way to let me know about the progress. I appreciated that. He even buttered me up a couple of days before I picked up the watch, telling me that it was ready and \"beautiful.\"\n\nI was shocked when I saw it! It looks almost brand new! It felt like I was receiving it for the first time again. Except for a couple of deep scratches it's endured over it's decade, the watch is pristine. He also cleaned the interior and exterior and replaced the faceplate, or crystal, which gives the impression that the watch is nearly right off the factory line.\n\nIf I had a mound of broken watches and jewelry, I would take the entire lot to Eddie. \n\nHe's earned my trust.",

It's the only place where a quick, inexpensive meal that's made with real food can be purchased as far as the eye can see. Think of it as a fast casual version of Mongolian BBQ.  Pick a starch, a meat, veggies, a sauce and they grill it up for customers. \n\nThe interior setup is awkward with customers having to cut the line in order to fill their cups with ice and tea, which are positioned opposite each other. Besides that though, I'm a fan. \n\nI ordered the subtlety spicy finadene chicken with brown rice, broccoli and mushrooms and left not even a grain of rice in the bowl. I finished it off with a piece of crazy good carrot cake, and washed it all down with some u sweetened tea. With the tip, it cost me about $15.",

  "text": "Yelena, you're a good woman.\n\nI had a wedding this past weekend, and in true Aimee style, I realized my dress wasn't hemmed about four days before I had to leave. It wasn't just a little long... it was about 4 inches too long. When I called Yelena she said she could get it done, and that she'd just have to charge me a rush fee (which I was more than okay with.) \n\nI brought it in and she had me try it on... do take the time to do that vs. just telling her how much to take off. The dress ended up being longer in certain places so she really had to pin differently all the way around it. Even with that, though, I had it dropped off in about ten minutes.\n\nWhen I picked it up on my way to the lake for the wedding, I just gave it a quick glance and was happy to see that the new hem line was flawless. Later that weekend when I put it on, I was even happier... it was the perfect length, just skimming the floor. Happy times indeed.\n\nI'm grateful she was able to help me in a pinch and it was well worth the $35. I'm going to bring her a handful of things next week because I've been waiting to find someone who does such quality work.\n\nThank you Yelena!",

The crab flavor was strong and the corn had a good bite to it.\n\nGumbo- M liked it more than me. He remembers liking it more last year. Not a big fan of all the okra.\n\nShrimp & Grits- Yum! I liked the heartiness of the grits and the sauce was tasty. Good amount of shrimp.\n\nP&J oysters- I didn't have any but M like these a lot.\n\nNow onto the bad. Our waiter was never really around. After having the fritters, we were served the oysters but our table didn't get cleared of the empty basket of fritters. After the our entrees came, the basket of fritters,the oysters, and dirty appetizer plates were still sitting empty on our table. We had not received the gumbo we ordered so someone else (still haven't seen our waiter) brought it out. \n\nWhen Matt was 80% done with his main entree, our waiter finally came to check on us and asked if we needed anything from him. Uhh... Yea! How about clearing the table? Or checking to see how our food was because maybe then he would have known we were served our last appetizer after we were already served our entree. \n\nFood was great, but the subpar service tainted the experience. We did let a manager know on the way out. If our server was around we could have told him too.",

I mean a crab omelet, a chorizo omelet, famous fried chicken, fried pickles, buffalo pizza, Mexican pizza.....the description on all these items make them sound great. \n\nI've been her twice and was really not impressed with breakfast....I will continue to come and find what I love though, because lunch seems more like appealing to me. My hubby-to-be loves the pancakes and omelets though (especially the chorizo one).\n\nMy recommendation if you love spicy food:\n\nBuffalo chicken pizza. SUPER spicy food that is....the buffalo chicken pizza will make a grown man cry. I normally like spicy food, and buffalo sauce is one of those things that varies so much in heat depending on the place. Well, this place definitely PACKS the heat! It came out of the kitchen bubbling with red sauce and I needed a milkshake to get past the first slice. \n\nIf you are sharing an appetizer: \n\nBaked Junkyard fries - gross name, but sooo good! They have cheese, chorizo, melted cheese, sour cream and all sorts of amazingness! I think if I ever end up pregnant, this is what my fetus and I would constantly crave. \n\nI would skip:\nDenver scramble. which sounds delicious with Sauteed Potatoes, Mushrooms, Onions and Peppers, Topped with Cheddar Cheese and 2 Scrambled Eggs...but it's not. The potatoes were not seasoned with any pepper or salt, and everything is just thrown together like a bad batch of hash browns. Also, it's a small portion compared to the other breakfast platters, so plan accordingly. \n\nI will definitely be returning to try their famous chicken, and the service is always friendly and just overall there is something very inviting about the place...especially their outside area in a cool summer day.",

  "text": "On one of the most non-descript corners of South Philadelphia, this tiny Indonesian eatery cooks up hearty dishes on a daily basis.  What sets Seulanga Cafe apart from other Indonesian spots in Philly is that this is a restaurant specializing in the foods from the island of Sumatra...a true Nasi Padang place.  And that of course is what I ordered.  The meal was decent enough without being anything special.  One of the reasons for this is that the food here is served cafeteria style meaning that it is not cooked to order but sits in the warming pans for a while.  Also there were no knives among the plastic utensils making the chicken especially difficult to eat.   They do have a tray of sauces you can avail yourself of to give a bit more flavor to the food.  But probably most noticeable when all is said and done - this Indonesian café was nowhere near as friendly as most of the other ones in Philadelphia.  Still if you have a hankering for Nasi Padang, give it a try and see what you think.",

We paid extra for the deluxe king room, so there was room for more than just a bed, and we didn't feel crowded. Plus - bonus - our room actually had a view of the Mississippi River, and it was strangely addicting to just stand there and watch the barges and tugs go by. I also loved that there was a Keurig coffee maker in the room.\n\nThe hotel was beautifully decorated for the Christmas holiday, so there were always people hanging out in the lobby and bar just enjoying the scenery or taking pictures. This is a crowded time of year for New Orleans, and the Carousel Bar in the hotel was always packed, but fortunately we were able to belly up to the bar next to the hotel restaurant, and sample their specialty holiday cocktails.  We had Christmas lunch at Criollo Restaurant in the hotel, and it was surprisingly good-with the desserts being exceptional.\n\nI do NOT think the staff is as professional as it is at other NOLA hotels we've stayed at: friends we were traveling with had constant issues with the staff and a scooter they rented, plus the doormen seemed to be more interested in chatting with each other than opening doors, saying hello, etc. Also, I think noise is a problem in all of these old hotels, and this one is no exception.  However, since we travel with a small speaker so we can sleep with white noise, this wasn't really an issue for us.\n\nThe location of the hotel is hard to beat, the elevators were surprisingly fast, and as a whole, we had a very good time here.",

We sat chatting for a while and once my water was empty it stayed that way. I must say that if you eat here you will be getting a bargain. 5 people ate for under $30!!!

But here's the reason for 3 stars instead of 4... \n\nThe cashier who was \"supposed\" to be taking my order found it moooooooore interesting to talk to her fellow cashier & that cashier's patron than to take my order. So, I PATIENTLY waited for her (Maya according to the register receipt) to acknowledge me, greet me & ask me to step forward before I did so (I initially thought she was helping her fellow coworker with an problem, but as I ear hustled, I learned she was engaging in a nonchalant conversation with the 2 other ladies)... So, 2.5 minutes passed & she FINALLY acknowledged me & took my order (which, of course, not surprisingly she got WRONG). \n\nThe food was good. Temperature was great. No biting & shuffling of food in your mouth because it was too hot. I got a little cheeseburger, thanks to my neglectful cashier, \"all the way\" less pickles. Grilled onions & mushrooms made me Happppppppppppppy!!!!\n\nThe burger prices seem comparable to Wendys, the fries are a little pricey, but I skipped out on that portion of the experience.  \n\nFree roasted peanuts for your dining pleasure, but don't throw those shells on the floor, as the sign directs; this AIN'T O'Henrys (well that part isn't in the sign... I threw that in for free  ) \n\nI enjoyed my dining experience, but I failed to see what all the hype was about.

  "text": "I was walking around downtown after grabbing a bagel and I thought - I'm going to check out that food hall someone mentioned to me recently! I'm from Dallas originally, and the first thing I thought when I walked around Assembly Food Hall was \"I'm home in Dallas!\" It makes sense now that I've been to the food hall's website, since it was developed by a company that has a food hall in Plano (Legacy). It's definitely nice. They spared no expense. It's made to look old and industrial, but it's all new. The space has a lot of seating. Inside the food hall are a few eateries: Desano Pizzeria, Cotton & Snow (shaved ice and cotton candy), Donut Distillery, Nobaked Cookie Dough, Oke Poke, Thai Esane, Whisk Crepes Cafe,...(and those are just the ones we saw on this level/area). But a lot of these locations have other locations in Nashville, so Assembly Food Hall felt like it was more for tourists than for locals. The Food Hall is within the larger Fifth + Broadway that has some shops that are often available in malls - Free People, Ariat, Molly Green, Ray Ban, Sephora (not open yet), etc., and other restaurants/bars/coffeeshops (CAVA, Eddie V's, Hattie B's, Jeni's Splendid Ice Cream, Shake Shack, Slim & Husky's,...). It's a great addition for tourists (and the few locals I know that go downtown with any frequency), because it offers a lot of new food options for anyone that is on or near Broadway. And it's great for these locally owned restaurants who can become better known to tourists that are downtown! But given its location (I've pretty successfully avoided Broadway in my five years in Nashville) and the fact that many of its restaurants have other city locations, it's not a food hall I would frequent. But definitely if you're downtown, whether as tourist or as a local walking around, it's worth checking out.",

  "text": "If you're visiting Santa Barbara, you'll note the architectural consistency of the downtown area and, indeed, much of the city. It's all dominated by the Spanish Colonial Revival style prevalent in the 1920s, which took special hold here after the town experienced huge damage in a 1925 earthquake.\n\nSo it's especially interesting to compare the elaborate, whitewashed nature of these newer buildings with the original itself - the Spanish royal presidio (el presidio real). The overall site dates back to 1782, and two structures from that era remain: El Cuartel and the Canelo Adobe. The most prominent structure, the chapel, has undergone repeated reconstruction due to earthquakes. There's a good amount of informative signage throughout the site.\n\nAlso interesting is how the most visible structures form only the northern wing of what was once a larger set of structures surrounding a courtyard where Canon Perdido and Santa Barbara Streets now intersect.",

It's not in the best part of town but during the day it seems ok.  Decent amount of parking and the staff is Oh so friendly and welcoming. \n\nThere are 3 different styles to chose from when picking your tacos.  Xtreme which includes cabbage, sour cream and cheese.  Tijuana which it the more traditional style with onions and cilantro and frankly I can't remember the 3rd, I should have gotten a picture of the menu.  The menu also includes Mexican style corn on the cob, Flatuas, so many delicious options.  \n\nI tried the Xtreme style shredded chicken. I loved all of the toppings, the chicken was a bit dry but overall good.  I also had Tijuana style al pastor absolutely delicious.  Don't forget to order the chips and salsa.  Full of wonderful flavor and homemade chips that have the right amount of crunch and flavor without being burnt.\n\nMy 2 tacos, chips and Salsa was just over $12 so in my opinion the prices are pretty standard.  I will absolutely revisit and I hope you do too!",

  "text": "This chain Mexican spot is a solid choice for family dining, most adventurous eaters might prefer to look elsewhere though. The chain was started by 2 Mexican natives in 1994, and has spread throughout the east coast with over 30 locations now. It is definitely better than other similar corporate Mex places.\n\nA groupon brought us here, and for an easy and economical family meal we were pleased. We liked the large space that had a more open feel than many south of the border shops that we find ourselves in. A sign at the entrance advertised some drink specials, when I saw $2 for a 16oz Dos Equis, I knew that would be what I was drinking. The menu was fairly large with most of the usual suspects, but also some more Americanized plates. Even a good selection of kid's meals.\n\nWe started with table made guac, you can tailor it to your own taste and the avocados were good and mostly ripe. But if you prefer it creamier as we do, you might want to specify from the start. The chips were not to my liking, definitely from a bag, I did like the salsa though. Both kids liked their choices, and we even had to order more beef tacos for the pickier of the two.\n\nTrish ordered seafood chimis, but unfried. She liked but I thought they had a fake seafood flavor. She didn't think she would order again. I had chicken chimis fried of course, and I was happy with the choice. The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned, tortillas nice and crispy, with just a little bit of cheese sauce. I added salsa and jalapeños to up the spice level. The sides of rice and beans were both pretty good too. We ended the meal with something the kids were not expecting, churros. 3 of us really liked them, warm and crispy with cinnamon sugar on the outside and caramel in the middle, plus a little container with even more to be drizzled on them at our will.\n\nEven without the groupon the prices seemed pretty fair. With it we felt like thieves. Service was friendly and quick throughout, but they appear to do quite a business on a Saturday night, so plan for that. Armed with another groupon and the kids, we would probably return. On our own, probably not. 3.5 is there such a thing as an authentic chain Yelps",

  "text": "It is interesting to me that the reviews here are so mixed. Did our move go perfectly? No. What move ever does? But were we pleased and satisfied? Yes. Would we use Helping Hands again? Yes.\n\nAfter much research and reading reviews, Better Business Bureau information, etc, we booked Helping Hands to move my dad from his home to his new apartment (he is downsizing). It was complicated because he needed packing services and we had to stop not only at his new place but also a nearby storage unit. Darryl and I corresponded first here on Yelp and then later by email several times before the move. Darryl was prompt in replying and answering my questions. Then he sent us several rounds of questions about the move and the specifics of the job. In all, I thought we were pretty well aligned and that the communication was good prior to the move. Here were are pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-The team was supposed to show up between 8 and 11 and Darryl promised me they would try their best to be there closer to 8. They arrived around 8:45, which was fine. The team of two - Colton and Floyd - were total rock stars. They were nice, they were respectful of our stuff, they asked questions when they weren't sure, they were very careful both packing and moving my dad's items and also in carefully packing the truck first to protect the items and also to ensure that everything was packed in a way that we could unload smartly at the apartment and then the storage unit. They thought it through and executed everything really well. We also appreciated that if they found items that had previously been cracked and glued back together or a table with a wobbly leg, etc, they were sure to point that out to us so that we could agree that this damage was not incurred during the move. Also, they never got grouchy, even though the move took eight hours. Really great. My dad and my sister kept asking me where I found this great moving crew.\n-I'm happy to say that we didn't have a single item broken in the move. Very impressed. Unpacking on the other end, we were really pleasantly surprised at how carefully our items were packed. I was also impressed with the care that was taken when the items themselves were being moved. There were several items that were a close fit through the door, and Colton and Floyd really had to work hard to get some of them through.\n-Obviously, the price was good compared to some of the other estimates I got. I will say, I was surprised when they rolled up in a Penske truck instead of their own truck with their own logo. They used boxes that they were recycling from Amazon, etc. It is a bit of a budget operation. It was less professionally run than other moves we've done with the big moving companies. There were no fancy numbered stickers on all the boxes or paperwork where you check off each box coming in the door. But they got the job done and the price was excellent. We felt it was a good deal for a pretty good quality move overall.\n\nCONS:\n-Despite discussing it prior to the move, the movers did not show up with proper packaging for the mattress or with wardrobe boxes, which I specifically asked for. However, after the move, Darryl did apologize for this oversight and offered us a good faith partial refund to make it up to us as that was their fault. We appreciated that very much.\n-As we were wrapping up at the storage unit (the second stop), I asked the movers if I was supposed to write them a check or what. They said that Darryl would send me an invoice, which he did as we were standing there. That was fine by me. We parted ways and I went back to join my family. All of us were starving and we sat down to eat some pizza. In the middle of this meal, I received a call from Floyd who basically said that Daryl was waiting for me to pay the invoice. I agree with Lavanya. This was really weird. If you want immediate payment, you should just ask people to write the movers a check before they leave the job. If you're going to invoice folks, give them a day or two to pay the invoice for heaven's sake. Moving is a really busy time. Moving day is insane. I think Helping Hands could eliminate this by simply asking people to pay upon completion of the job then.\n-I will say that I felt Helping Hands could benefit from having some more professional processes in place. It is confusing to use their website -- they use a program called Calendly where you pick your date and time slot and request it. Then they email you an invoice and you pay it to lock in your date. Then you get multiple back and forth questionnaires from Darryl. The intake seems a bit disjointed and not that smooth. And I could see how it would make some people nervous.\n\nFortunately I am good with technology and was willing to take the risk and I am glad I did. Like I said -- our move wasn't perfect, but no move is. Overall we were pleased with our service and would recommend Helping Hands.",

  "text": "4.5\n\nWhaaat? I'm late. I'm so very very late. It seems that most everyone who knows food in Middle Tennessee was already hip to the deliciousness of Soy Bistro. Mea culpa. To my credit, it's not entirely my fault that I am eight or so years late dining here. I don't get to Brentwood that often and I confused this establishment with another of a similar name and menu. But, still. My mistake. If you haven't picked up what I'm putting down is that you should probably get to Soy Bistro sooner rather than later.\n\nI was a bit intimated coming here, as tales of a small parking lot and long lines stressed me out a bit. I was pleased to discover that arriving at 1 pm on a Friday afforded me a spot in front and a line that moved very quickly. The food gods were shining on me. When my lunch partner and I arrived at the counter, we were greeted with a smile and pleasant conversation. Stahp it, Soy Bistro. We're already going steady. I prepared myself for another potential bomb: I needed something that was gluten-free. Before my gut betrayed me, I was a Korean food-eating machine. But I know that a lot of meats and sauces are made with soy sauce so... I barely had the question out of my mouth before the gentleman behind the counter told me I had nothing to worry about: there were plenty of gluten-free items from which to choose and most everything could be made gluten-free.\n\nGirls, hit your hallelujah.\n\nThere was no stopping me now. I ordered the kimchi fried rice and kept it moving. My lunch partner and I nabbed a table and started business talking. Within a very reasonable amount of time, I had a mound of beautifully red fried rice, packed with kimchi and spam and topped with a fried egg. Better yet, when the food came out, the owner grabbed utensils and napkins for us because we were just *that* out of it to miss it on our first pass. Oh, did I mention the spicy sauce that came on the side? I should. It added a surprising kick (I am usually not one for creamy sauces with Asian cuisine) and it was gluten-free. I broke the yolk, mixed it and and the sauce in the rice, took out my chopsticks (It had been way too long since I was able to eat with chopsticks) and went to town.\n\nSo so good. The kimchi was wonderfully pickled and spicy and the salty fat of the spam balanced well with the creaminess of the aforementioned sauces. The rice was a star of the plate, not a place holder. The chef (I met) knows what she's doing. We were checked on a few times during the meal and enjoyed some pleasant small talk. Eying the specials and house favorites, I made several notes to self of dishes to try upon return visits -- because there will be return visits.\n\nDon't wait as long as I did; get yourself to Soy Bistro as soon as you can. The people behind the brand are really *really* nice and the food is as good as advertised... maybe even better. For all your transplants bemoaning the 'lack' of certain cuisines in Nashville... come get your fill in Brentwood. I know you have a car.",

I asked one of the bouncers where we go could to get food at this hour and he pointed to Paradise Park and I was still skeptical. He assured me the food was decent so in we went. The place was the strangest bar we encountered throughout our four day stay in Nashville. The floor looked like a putting green near the stage area and the band was odd. I'm not sure what they were playing exactly but it was chaotic. The people near the stage were wild, it was a very very interesting crowd. The bar towards the back was as divey as it gets, I mean DIVEY. Stool seating, not the cleanest, HUGE sink filled with beers behind the bar. If I wasn't starving beyond belief I would have walked out. We ordered a hot chicken sandwich with french fries and I got a grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The food was served on a tray and we walked to tables next door that seemed like it was part of another restaurant/bar, we still aren't positive. I don't know if the food tasted amazing because we had been drinking since noon or if the food was actually that good, but regardless, we were very very happy in that moment. The bartender as busy as she was had no problem running to the back to get us extra honey mustard and blue cheese. The meal soaked up whatever we had in our system that day and we were able to stay out another 3 hours so for that Paradise Park, I thank you.",

  "text": "My chicken gyro was alright. Going in, I knew I had to keep my expectations low, because they have a huge menu of varied foods and types of cuisine, and that's never a good sign. It's like that saying: jack of all trades, master of none. They have tacos, and gyros, and cheesesteaks, and burgers, and and and ... \n\nSo my chicken gyro was alright. It satisfied my appetite. My husband got the Philly cheesesteak, and he said it was OK. We also got a cheeseburger and fries for the kids, and they really liked it. Overall, our meal was just fine, and I especially liked that I paid less than $20 for all that food. The cheeseburger and fries combo even came with our choice of lemonade. We chose original.\n\nOh, that's another thing. You can choose different flavors of lemonade, but they really just have a base lemonade flavor (lemon), and then they will add squirts of high-fructose-corn-syrup-food-coloring water in your choice of artificial flavor. It's the kind of stuff that's squirted on snow cones. Whomp whomp. If you're going to have the word \"lemonade\" as a part of your business name, and you're going to offer different flavors of lemonade, shouldn't you make actual different types of lemonade? Anyone agree with me? No one? Maybe I'm just being grouchy. \n\nWhile I was waiting for my food (they cook it it up fresh to order, by the way, which is nice), I got to enjoy a Puff Daddy/Mase music video on the TV, which was amazing and almost made me bump this review up to four stars. A restaurant that can transport me to 1997 can't be half bad.",

  "text": "The Betsy Ross House is a very cheap historical tourist thing to do while you spend a day learning about American history. For only $5 you can visit the home where Betsy Ross and her husband, John Ross, once lived and for an additional $3 you can get the audio tour. However please note that it is believed that Betsy Ross only lived here for a short time of her life.\n\nMy husband and I came here on a Thursday afternoon, a little before 3 pm. We walked through the courtyard and into the gift shop to pay for admission. We decided to forgo the audio tour and just read all of the little boards. From this tour, you will learn that Elizabeth, or as commonly known as \"Betsy\" Ross was born into a Quaker family. She did her apprenticeship with an upholster and really learned the craft quite well. She eventually met his first husband, John Ross, who was also an upholster, and fell in love.\n\nBeing from a Quaker family, her family did not support the marriage of Betsy and John. They eventually opened their own upholstery business, which surprisingly General George Washington (yep that Washington) was one of their biggest customers. Unfortunately John passed away after being married for only 2 years, during war time. Betsy eventually remarried to a man named Joseph Ashburn, in which they had 2 daughters. But one of their daughters passed away after 9 months. Sadly her second husband also died too. Things weren't really looking that great for Betsy since she was now a widow again, before the age of 30.\n\nBetsy Ross remarried a 3rd time, John Claypoole. He came to tell her that her 2nd husband died and eventually they fell in love. They were married for 34 years and had 5 daughters. Sadly only 1 survived into adulthood. \n\nThe self guided tour of the house itself was very basic and it was bothersome to read the story boards around the house when there were several people crowding around it. My husband and I would just come back to those boards to read once people moved to other parts of the rooms to read. One room that I thought was interesting was when we met an actress who played Betsy Ross in which she would tell visitors about her life and could answer questions. She also taught visitors how to cut a 5 pointed star (you may pick up a small handout at the gift shop if you would like a copy or check out my photo), stating that was much easier to make a 5 pointed star instead of a 6 pointed star how George Washington had initially intended for the US Flag to have. \n\nNow there is some controversy that Betsy Ross did not create the first flag. Whether you believe that or not is your own opinion. But the history is here to learn about her life and how this may have come to pass (or if it is a legend that she made the first US Flag). \n\nOverall, this was a nice little tour that we completed in about 30 minutes. I wouldn't make a special trip to go out here, but if you are already touring other places like Independence Hall and The Liberty Bell, then consider making a visit. \n\nPlease note that inside the home, there are narrow, spiral steps that are not handicap accessible. Also there are restrooms located downstairs in the gift shop basement. \n\nAnd lastly in the court yard, you can find Betsy Ross's grave. If you are interested in listening to free story telling, there is an employee who is out there that does that at various times. Also there is a small little food cart that sells soft pretzels, water ice, water, hot dogs, chips, etc in case you are hungry.",

  "text": "I'd been contemplating trying Rockstone Pizzeria & Pub since my visit to the nearby Wiseguys Pizza, but it was a recent visit by a friend that made me finally say \"Okay, it's time.\" So, on a lazy Sunday afternoon I decided it would be a great place to enjoy a meal, watch the Colts game, and read my Sunday newspaper. \n\nRockstone is located in a strip center just inside Fishers, Indiana with a Sahm's location and a Massage Indy location also located in the strip. It's not a particularly impressive building, but it's infinitely less divey than the nearby Wiseguys. \n\nI will admit that Rockstone lost a star before I ever made it inside. While they have a nice little curb cut that helps with wheelchair access, they'd rather ignorantly placed their outdoor signage on the sidewalk very close to an outdoor bike rack and it blocked anyone with a mobility issue from actually accessing the restaurant. While I was able to move it, it wasn't exactly simple to do so and a lot of folks with mobility issues wouldn't be able to do so. \n\nOnce I got by the sign, I went in their double-glass doors and there was a host/hostess area with a hand-written sign to seat ourselves at the bar. That was simple enough and, in fairness, I did arrive at almost 2pm in the afternoon. So, I seated myself at a four-seat table that was for the most part out of the light from the outside. The walls had several televisions, all playing football games and all playing the Colts game with the exception of one. There were also a few booths along the outside of the dining area against the walls. The place was almost empty with the exception of a couple booths that were taken and a handful of bodies at the bar. \n\nI don't really consider myself high maintenance, but I do have this guideline that if you're an employee and you see me enter and sit down then you should acknowledge me whether you're going to be my server or not. So, I was a little disconcerted to have one server completely ignore me as she walked by me twice. Finally, a server came by and noticed my presence and handed me a drink menu before noticing I hadn't been given any other menus. I'm not sure why I needed a lunch menu when lunch specials are only applicable Monday-Friday, but I received one. \n\nThe decor has sort of a pub meets industrial vibe to it. The drink menu is extensive, though I stuck with my usual iced tea. The menu consists primarily of wood-baked pizzas, appetizers, a couple desserts, and a few foccaccia sandwiches. While the idea of a whole pizza wasn't really appealing, I opted for a 10\" pepperoni as I'd been told their wood-stove pizzas were good. \n\nThe wait wasn't bad at all and within a few minutes I had my pizza. It was light, crispy, and to be perfectly honest I had no problem polishing it all off without feeling overly stuffed. Of course, I hadn't eaten at all during the day and that likely helped. The toppings were good and plentiful and balanced throughout each slice. \n\nService was attentive and I did get my always desired refill. \n\nWhat's my overall impression? As I noted, I swiped away one star right away because of the unnecessary and inconsiderate accessibility issue. Thus, we're in the 3-4 star range here. There's a part of me that wants to give Rockstone a 4-star rating, but I have to be honest and say it lacked that certain spark that separates it from other establishments. While there's no question that the atmosphere is vastly superior to Wise Guys, I honestly preferred the Wise Guys pizza. This pizza, while I liked the wood-baked quality, was good but it simply didn't \"wow\" me like I want an upper tier pizzeria to wow me. The same was true for the service - it was attentive but not particularly inviting. In my opinion, really good service makes you want to go back and go back soon. I enjoyed my meal, but Rockstone will definitely not be a destination spot for me. If I really want a wood-baked pizza, Napolese is closer and superior.",

  "text": "What a gawd awful place to eat.  We had just spent the morning at the crayola factory and we were all hungry.  I remembered Cracker Barrel as a kid and thought it would be fun to revisit it.\n\nMAJOR FAIL\n\nWe were quickly seated and that's the extent of our positive experience.  Our server took her time taking our order.  I placed the kid's orders first and they took forever to come out.  The place wasn't busy.\n\nNext, we finally placed our orders (the kids were practically done at this point).  My sister in law and I ordered the same thing- oven baked chicken breast.  I don't know how this happened, but my dish was the last one out of the kitchen.  So, they (SIL and my husband) ate their entire meal and I watched.  Finally, mine was brought out but it was so uncomfortable to eat knowing they were done.  I was *thisclose* to cancelling my order.\n\nThe food isn't good- period.  My husband's steak was well-done andhe asked for it medium well.  Service was awful.  I'm not sure who's fault the crappy timing of the meal was- the server or the cook. \n\nI won't be back.",

  "text": "Yay!  Yet another grocery store in town!  I was actually pretty glad to hear Sprouts was coming to Tampa - I had shopped at one in Alabama, and loved their ready-to-eat section.\n\nSince I went on opening week, the parking lot was full as I expected, but fortunately the store is in the center of a huge strip mall, and there was plenty of parking to be had in front of other stores.\n\nSide Story #1 - as I was walking back to my car, I watched as a car pulled in next to mine, flung open her door, and whacked my car.  When I walked up to inspect it and said, \"Hey, you hit my car!\" the response I got back was an angry (at me) \"I barely touched it!\".  I suppose an \"I'm sorry\" was too much to hope for, in this day and age.\n\nWhen I walked into Sprouts, the first thing I noticed was the enormous selection of produce. I have heard it compared to Trader Joes and Fresh Market, but this section looked larger and fresher than either of those stores.  I also loved that they had a huge variety of fresh cut flowers and plants.\n\nSince I couldn't wait to get in and out of the madness that was the store on this day, I headed straight to the area that had pre-packaged food, and bought a smorgasbord of items to go:  buffalo nuggets (very spicy), turkey meatloaf with vegetables (surprisingly filling and good), a premade sandwich with deli buffalo chicken and tomatoes, which sadly had very soggy bread from the tomatoes, and falafel balls (see Side Story #2).  My biggest complaint with all the to-go food was that it was hard to get the plastic lids off, and that the plastic lids could not go in the microwave.\n\nSide Story #2 - the falafel balls are supposed to be microwaved for 2-3 minutes before eating them. I took the lid off, took the sauce out, and heated them up. They came out perfectly, and were delicious. There were so many in there though, I saved about half of them for the next day. Next day, heated the remainder up, and after about a minute the whole microwave started to smoke and I had to rush over and dump the flaming falafel balls in the sink!  Phew!  Boy did my house stink!  Apparently the falafel balls are a one-time-heat-up type thing - who knew?\n\nSo, other than the falafel excitement, I will definitely be heading back to Sprouts to try some of their other ready-made options.",

The Fuji Chicken Salad I ordered had no chicken in it. I got my salad home, opened it up with ravenous anticipation, only to realize that there was no chicken. To make matters worse, there were about 60 pieces of red onion in the salad. \"Would you like some lettuce with your onions?\" I enjoy onions, but I'd rather not endure an afternoon of heartburn from eating dozens of pieces of them. Worse yet, it was my damn birthday. Talk about disappointment! \n\nAnd why was the baguette as hard as a rock at 12:00 PM? \n\nPanera Bread in general has always been a place of consistency for me. Fresh salads, hot soups, and you can rest-assured knowing that your order is correct. Nowadays, the only consistent aspect of Panera is that something will go awry with even the simplest order. It's a statewide epidemic!\n\nIf Panera didn't offer caffeine free fountain Diet Pepsi, then I would write them off for good. Once that goes awry, then I am \"out\"!",

Bad idea to come here on an empty stomach as everything looks so good, and you might just convince yourself to buy a whole cake when you have no need for one.\n\nWe used admirable restraint and kept our selections to a few small desserts. It was hard to narrow down the choices, but we eventually agreed on a peanut butter cookie, an individual cheesecake, and lastly a butterfingers brownie bar. The cookie and cake were good but not taste bud blowing. But the brownie, if I tried that while standing my knees would have buckled. This may have been the best brownie type treat I've ever had, and trust me, I've had a lot.\n\nWe will definitely be back for further research, specifically in the brownie department. And there is a pound cake with an obscene amount of chocolate ganache that taunted me as well as a chocolate skull. Based on future visits this could well be updated to 5 star status, for the time being 4.5 \" who knew butterfingers could be orgasmic \" Yelps",

  "text": "So here is a place that I've been wanting to try for a minute, and I finally got my chance.  Rarely am I both near Kennedy and DM and hungry.  \n\nUpon walking up, I was impressed to see a huge sign out front advertising that they use La Segunda Cuban bread.  I was thinking, \"Wow, not bad considering they're a chain from Jax.\"  Well, when I got inside, I was warmly greeted by the staff and my order was quickly taken.  However, after placing my order, I saw a sign claiming they were voted \"Best Cuban.\"  I'm just not buying it.  First off, I want to know who the hell voted a chain \"best Cuban\" in a city, not only where the damn sandwich was invented, but that is also chock-full of places that serve up amazing versions of the sandwich.  Seriously folks, let's get a damn grip here.  It was laughable.\n\nSo I sit down and out comes our sammiches, and they look great.  I got the Kong turkey deal, and my son got a 12\" turkey and cheese.  The sandwich was good, and I love the fact that they use all of these less damaging cold cuts.  No anti-biotics and all that good stuff, but my son looked over at me after dusting off his sammich and said, \"It was good, but I don't see what's so \"giant\" about these sandwiches and it's definitely not the best I've had. I like Firehouse better.\"  He's only 15, but the boy knows sandwiches, and I sadly couldn't help but to agree with him.  In the Jax chain sandwich war, I think Firehouse wins.\n\nAfter eating, I sat there digesting for a moment, and I saw one of those table top rolodex style advertisement things, so I started flipping thru them, and what I saw shocked, amazed and offended me as a Tampanian (see pic).  It was an ad for their Cuban sandwich, or should type, their \"Cuban sandwich.\"  First off, the picture is laughable because it's not even on Cuban bread.  Second, at the bottom, it reads \"straight out of Miami.\"  Whoa!  Hold the fugg up, mofos!  Are you serious with that?  You're going to be a CHAIN restaurant, claiming to have been voted best Cuban by someone somewhere and then have the stones to put an add of one on a table in Tampa depicting a sandwich not even on Cuban bread and then top it off with the words \"straight out of Miami\"???  I can clearly see that some corporate education is needed up in Jacksonville where they wouldn't know a Cuban sandwich if it slapped them in the face,  I've been there on multiple occasions, trust me.\n\nAnywho, the sandwich was good, but not better than Lenny's across the street, nor Jimmy John's a few miles to the east, so I can't ever see going back.",

From mofongo to empanadas, they've got it. The front case features all of the food so you can get a peek before ordering. They offer two types of rices and two types of beans. We especially enjoyed our chicken arepa and black beans with white rice. We also ordered a beef empanada. Service was a-okay and we opted for carry out. Next time, I would also like to try the beef empanadas. The beef looked very juicy and flavorful.

The menu selection from dessert, sandwiches, bowls, to taco and wings. It more interesting than the mother Fresh Kitchen which is boring after 4 or 5 visit. \n\nWe got the fried Byrd. This sandwich includes Peruvian slaw, fried buttermilk chicken with cluck sauce. The chicken is crispy. The sauce is great. The entire assembly is harmony. We also hot the charcoal soft serve with peanut jam, coconut flakes, and banana slice. The charcoal soft serve is the best we have. Food is great here especially you look for snack. They also has pork bun which match Asian flavor. \n\nOverall we like it. But in winter raining day, the inside seating is impossible due low temperature AC unit. Too cold to seat inside.",

Each area is so much fun with the wine, the cheese, the coffee bar, the desserts, the deli, all of the different foods.\nThere is a huge array of food to order whether it's the 20 something sandwiches, and soup options, or whatever is in the pretty clear glass case. They serve it up warm for you if you want. The food in the case ranges from salads, to pastas, to seafood and chicken. Served up either individual style or by pound. To me, the pound thing can get kind of tricky, but they will weigh it for you, and let you know how much it costs.  Hold off on getting your ticket to make your order until you choose what you want to order. Just making a decision is a fun project in itself. Once you are ready, grab your number, and wait to be called. \nThe service working there are very nice and helpful, especially for the ones that are not versed on their system of ordering. Everything looks and tastes scrumptious, and I can not wait to be back. I can definitely bring friends and family here too so they can check out the goodness of Mazzaro's.",

  "text": "Authentic Nashville-style hot chicken in Indy! The chicken here is SO good, and they have some creative dishes like chicken and waffles and chicken sandwiches.\nI had the quarter chicken white with a waffle. The chicken is served just the way it was at the restaurants we ate at in Nashville, with a pickle slice on top and a piece of white bread to soak up all the sauce (yes, you get bread even if you ordered the waffle). The chicken was fantastic. The waffle was decent but not as good as the chicken.\nThey have lots of spice levels, including \"southern fried\" if you don't want the heat. I had the Ella's Favorite spice level (\"burst of flavor and a little heat\") which was perfect for me. As advertised, the chicken was very flavorful and had a bit of spice but didn't burn my mouth. My husband had the Tweener (\"medium heat\") level and that was noticeably hotter although still not as hot as even the \"mild\" flavor at Hattie B's in Nashville. He had his chicken in the form of the chicken and pimento cheese sandwich. I tried a bite and it was so good - next time I'm getting that. We also had sides of the mac and cheese and french fries. The mac and cheese had kind of a gummy texture but I really loved the flavor and it paired really well with the hot chicken.\nPrices are super reasonable. We had more food than we could eat and it was only $20 for the two of us. I thought the service was really friendly and the food came out super fast, despite a sign that warns you that it's made to order and will take a while. \nTwo minor, non-food related complaints: there was no soap in the women's bathroom, which is a little gross (especially if you think about the employees who have to use the bathroom and return to work) and their drink dispenser doesn't do a good job of separating the water from the fruit punches and the \"water\" comes out bright pink.",

Joey threw on a 2nd slice for my husband, and he didn't charge us for either one!\n\nI think that for 1 beverage, 2 omelets/hasbrowns, and pie (free) our check was a little more than $20, probably our cheapest meal while on vacation in New Orleans.",

Pretty good location. \n\nIt is one of the newer designed, small footprint stores, with wrap around, two lane, drive thru.  They really expect most of their business to stay outside.  They are friendly and efficient at what they do. But, if you are a pedestrian, be careful approaching the front door as there will be traffic bearing down on you, with drivers not necessarily paying attention to your presence.  \n\nThe food is standard Mickey fare.  I am more fond of their breakfast sandwiches than the burgers.  I grabbed a sausage, egg & cheese biscuit and large coffee on my way to the office.  Priced at just over $5., it was a reasonable deal.  The meal was freshly made, with tender, buttery biscuit and still hot patty.  The coffee has been pretty good lately, and the one price of any size is a clever marketing tool.  \n\nBreakfast @ desk is not my favorite way to eat, but some days it can be like that.  \n\nEverything was satisfactory.",

Not only did BR amaze us with burgers, but their wings, chili and fries were equally as good. \n\nOur feast at Bailey's begun with Smoked Pablano Chicken Wings and a Cup of Chili. We enjoyed the wings, they provided a different twist to the traditional \"hot\" wings and the chili was kick ass. The chili had a spice that provided a good kick that we could not name, but loved it just the same. It was topped with melted cheese and croutons. Croutons are a nice upgrade from oyster crackers and add an additional flavor. \n\nTo test a new burger restaurant, we figured it was best to try the \"basic\" burger. If they can not do a basic burger, how will they be able to do the \"specialty\" burgers. They nailed it! Our burgers were juicy, cooked to our specifications and served with all the toppings. Bailey's doesn't stop at a good burger, they put it on a house made bun, that can rival some bakery buns. \n\nWe shared a small order of fries and I can tell you a small is enough to satisfy two. Their fries are house cut, no frozen pre-cut fries at BR. As our sauce we choose \"crazy catsup\", which I wish could be bought to take home. I love the way they serve their catsup, in the small mason jars. I recently have become a big fan of places that provide catsup in small cups instead of nasty bottles. \n\nA visit to Bailey's Range would not be complete without having a shake. Again, we went with the a traditional shake instead of one their now famous \"boozy shakes\". \nI had my favorite flavor, strawberry and Brad got creative and mixed vanilla ice cream with blueberry sorbet. They said, they have not had anyone mix ice cream and sorbet before. His creation was fantastic, he joked that he is glad we do not live in a loft downtown, because he would have one everyday. The shakes were better then a specialty parlor down on Locust. \n\nOur waitress was friendly and provided great service. I will be honest, the reason they did not get a five is fault of the kitchen. All the food was excellent, but we had just received our wings and chili when another server approached with our burgers. Next time, we will hold back and not order burgers until we are finished enjoying our appetizers. However, they took ownership of the error and without complaining they made it right by treating us to our shakes and removing them from our bill. \n\nBailey's Range, I'll be back. You gave me good service, good food and I like that your carryout vessels are eco-friendly.",

The parents of the bride were gracious and generous hosts, and a great time was had by all due to the stunning newly wedded couple, and their happy guests.\n\nThe reception was held in the catering hall, where there seems to be ample space and staff to host 2 concurrent events. This space seemed out of date, but clean and utilitarian. The front garden section seems like a nice spot for wedding party photos.\n\nI'm not an expert on catered food( thank God) but have to admit that quality was lacking. I won't even comment on the apps and passed hors d'oeuvres, but the main dishes need to be addressed. Crab cakes, if I was blindfolded and asked to taste I might say it was some type of seafoodesque cake, but not crab. Unless by crab they meant shells and other unused parts. Chicken parm, not even served with pasta and a disgrace to Italians everywhere. Beef, no, I won't even bother. \n\nThe service aspect was fair. The many servers seemed moody and unfriendly, although efficient. I thought the began to clear things too quickly, be it between courses or at the end if the night. \n\nSo the big question I guess is if I would recommend this spot. Not knowing the cost of this per person versus other venues it is hard for me to say. I will say that if I were to receive an invite to attend another event here I would not be excited to partake in the food.

It is an active marina and it is easy to be distracted by the beautiful boats plying the water among the berths.\n\nThis experience is all about outdoor dining. While there is an inside dining area, it has little atmosphere compared to the wide open vistas up and down the river from the overhung patio.  We arrived shortly before 9 am, and were seated at a table within ten minutes.  Coffee flowed, and the menus consisted of traditional breakfast fare from top to bottom.  We opted for a fresh poured and ironed waffle with bacon and a sausage & feta omelet with the home fries thrown inside.  While we waited, we watched the power boats cruising the river and slowly moving around the marina.  It made for a very relaxed and dreamy morning. \n\nThis is one of those adventures where the surroundings trumped the food.  The meals were good, but not more.  My omelet was absolutely loaded with meat, cheese and potatoes, but the sausage links were dry from over-frying, and the eggs could have used a little water in mixing to make them light and fluffy.  The waffle was fine, but would have been so much better with a maple syrup option, rather than the Smucker's corn syrup cheap substitute.  \n\nStill, we really didn't mind the food quality as we mellowed in the moment on the water's edge.  They certainly have the business humming, and don't need to upgrade if they choose not to.  I would come back again regardless, because the environment was so pleasant.  \n\n\"... Summer breeze makes me feel fine.  Blowing through the jasmine in my mind...\"",

  "text": "I don't know why I have trouble remembering this place exists. I think because it blends in with so much on 4th Ave that it just sort of becomes a wash.\n\nToday, however, TTS was a standout success. I ventured out this morning for one thing and one thing only, a really ugly holiday sweater for Yelp Tucson's first Elite Event at the Abbey. http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-abbey-eat-drink-tucson. I struck out at a few places, and then knocked it out of the park here. There were two ginormous racks of holiday sweaters, literally jumping off hangers and into my arms! It was hard to choose, but I wound up with a delightful zip-up cardigan with snowmen and snowflakes that I would actually consider wearing in more normal circumstances. \n\nEven better than my sweater was the accessory I scored. I'd love to talk about it, but I'm afraid some Elites might read this review and I'll have spoiled my Ho Ho Ho surprise. I'll get a photo up of the ensemble so you can truly appreciate the joy I have for rediscovering a Tucson mainstay. Oh and the staff there is super friendly and really informative. When I was going back and forth between two picks, the cashier was helpful in leading me to a festive decision!",

I think there is enough variety here that a group of people coming to eat here would find something that they like, however, it's not as dense as the Reading terminal in terms of yummy smells and options.\n\nI think there is a lot of room for growth in terms of the space and vendor types. That said, I think it caters more toward a work crowd and tourist crowd as opposed to a foodie crowd.",

I sat on the banquette on the second level.  After a few sips I noticed the most peaceful view of the river passing by.  This made the whole experience more delightful.  \n\nLots of regulars that seem to know, or at least, greet each other.  Makes this cozy, you are in someone's living room, type feeling.  College student to seniors seem to enjoy this coffee shop.  I can see why.  The staff is super friendly and hard working. Tables cleaned the moment they opened up. They also have free Wi-Fi.  \n\nI will return for a big warm mug of coffee...next time I will add a croissant.   The croissant are the size of someone's face, they are HUGE!

  "text": "I feel like I stumbled on a neighborhood secret walking into Sunday brunch here. The vibe at Pro Tap is laid back cool. A tad hipsta but what great brunch place isn't nowadays?\n\nWe needed 3 things: carb items for my daughter, eggs and sausage for my son, area proximity due to party proceeding...ok maybe four...bloody marys...always a requirement.\n\nWe were greeted with smiles and the wait was nothing (5 mins) compared to other brunch places. Albeit this is a bar but the brunch game is strong my friends.\n\nI definitely recommend getting the Bloody Mary. It's spicy and garnished with homemade pickled veggies. Your choice of vodka.\n\nWe ordered a chocolate, caramel donut for the table to try because it was $2 and it was ridiculous. Hot out of the fryer made it crunchy on the outside with a cakey inside and whatever goodness they garnished with was off the plate and devoured within seconds.\n\nKiddos ordered the chocolate chip pancakes  as well as eggs and sausage. The portions are enormous. The toasted sourdough that comes with egg dishes is superb and you can order as a side. The pile of seasoned fries are a crispy nice addition instead of home fries.\n\nThe stunner is the chicken french toast with sunny eggs, kale and cabbage slaw, and peppered maple syrup. The combination of the crunchy kale and cabbage slaw and the saltiness of the fried chicken coupled with the gooey sunnies and peppery sweet maple syrup was insane. I will go back for that lovely dish.\n\nOverall I was really impressed and would recommend!!",

They advertised a night time happy hour from 11pm til 2am one time when I was there but then they didn't have it when I returned so that made me a bit unhappy (along with the fact they were OUT of roast beef for the roast beef po boy).  They do have some mighty tasty burgers here and I really do enjoy eating those here.  They have bison and lamb burgers available sometimes as well.  I would like to sample the roast beef po boy but I as I mentioned before I was foiled in my attempt.  This place is usually open til 2am so it is a great late spot to grab a tasty burger or sample some of the other things on their menu.",

  "text": "Great place on the Santa Barbara wharf. We got there by chance at about 15 minutes before and there was only one couple in line ahead of us. They were local and said they open promptly and they opened right at 11:00 sharp. We picked our table and got menus and drinks very quickly. The wait staff was amazing-very professional, friendly and got our orders right away-really nice since we were hungry. \n\nThe room filled up almost immediately after opening with almost all tables and only a few seats at the bar open. Even with all the people, our orders came out pretty fast. \nWe ordered two Brophy Burgers, clam chowder, clam strip plate and a steak with a salad. \n\nThe Brophy Burgers were tasty and the meat juicy. The clam chowder was delicious-so thick and full of clams. The clam strip plate was with fries and coleslaw. The clams were meaty and had a good flavor-not the normal mostly breading kind. The fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and coleslaw was good too. The steak was the highlight though. It was cooked to perfection, melted in your mouth and the white wine, butter reduction was perfect. It came with potatoes or rice-and the rice was a wild rice pilaf that was delicious. \n\nWe would definitely come back to eat here again. It is a bit loud-maybe because of the low ceilings but it is worth getting in line or whatever to give this a try.",

  "text": "4.5 stars\n\nCome for the light show, but definitely DO NOT stay for the food.\n\nMy friend informed me that this hotel has a nightly light show that was not to be missed. The hotel used to be a major railroad hub, hence the name, and much of the original architecture has been preserved in the upper foyer. The architecture is nothing short of majestic. Beautiful arches, opulence all around. Just a stunning place in its own right.\n\nOh, but when the light show begins...\n\nI expected little more than a few colorful projections on the walls and ceilings but what I got was nothing short of a show. \n\nAt 5:00 on the dot, the lights dropped suddenly, the music cued and we were taking on a kaleidoscopic journey of epic proportions! So many colors, shape, images... And the show changes regularly as well. from what I understand they sometimes do seemed shows, especially around the holidays.\n\nI'm not sure if the show runs every hour on the hour, or more frequently, but it does run from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. every night. It only lasts about 10 minutes, but it is absolutely worth seeing.\n\nI fully intended for this to be a 5-star review, but ugh THE FOOD! my friend warned me that the food here was not great, but that was an understatement. I can't remember the last time I had food that bad. The bartender recommended to smoke wings, which happened to be one of my favorite things right now. These were like no smoke wings I had ever had. As I was finishing the first one, the bar manager came over to ask if everything was okay. She must have seen the distress on my face. I was trying to find words for how bad this food was without being too rude, but when she asked me what was wrong with them, they were so bad I couldn't even tell her one specific thing. They hardly taste smoked; they were actually fried and the texture was odd. I've never had wings botched that badly. \n\nShe sent them back and I ordered the lobster and manchego flatbread, which is what I initially planned on eating. \n\nThat was even worse! \n\nThe bread that they served it on did not work well at all. It was soft and spongy, not toasted and slightly crispy like most other flatbreads I've had. for whatever reason, the toppings also did not play well with one another. Nothing about this dish was good.after two bites, I ask for my check. The bartender to clearly tell that this dish was even more of a flop than the last one, so he kindly removed that from my bill as well.\n\nWith that said, I will repeat my warning: come for the light show, but under no circumstances should you remain for the food.",

  "text": "Want to dance? In the Quarter? Really, really big group of friends? Jax Brewery is your best bet in the French Quarter in my opinion for groups of 25+ to \"get down\" without having to fight over elbow room. \n\nOccasionally there is a cover. I can't be sure what nights/what time, but call ahead to check and let me know if you get a solid schedule. Also, if you have a large group that's going in, you may be able to work out a deal with them for cover. \n\nShannon S. has successfully described the layout, and I second Mallory E.'s frustration over trying to get a drink but there are multiple bars ( I believe 4?) so sidle up to the one where the bartender is a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend, and you may have a better chance of getting a drink though they're not going to be your dive bar cheap.  \n\nIf you're the sensitive type and want to chat with your friends the back bar by the patio on the river side is perfect and the patio is quite large for smokers and non.   If you could care less what the person is saying next to you, the dance floor is huge with enough room to allude that creepy guy that keep rolling air dice and shooting imaginary guns. If you want a hybrid spot, the bar to the right of the stairs with windows facing the street has seating but you can still hear the DJ, BUT I've had the most trouble getting a drink at this particular bar. \n\nOn the last occasion, our friend got the \"VIP section\" right behind the DJ booth. A couple of things to be aware of if you're assigned this VIP section. There's no bouncer except my personal reinforcement of a sad little droopy rope...so people will hop over constantly to sit, slouch, make out, and dance on your purse and coat, and possibly take one of the two home. This spot is REALLY LOUD. And, from what I can remember in my drunken haze...the DJ doesn't take requests (or maybe he can't hear or understand my slurring). \n\nOn another note, the bathrooms are usually clean and the line, if there is one, goes quickly for the girls bathroom. \n\nThough I have these complaints, if you've got a really large group, it's a great time because you're surrounded by friends without having to actually touch them, and that's hard to find that much space in New Orleans to shake your tush.",

Really!?! Beer was $10+ And I never found a Starbucks or coffee joint.  I wish they had options like the Jugo Juice stand at the Saddledome in Calgary.\n\nThe bars on the main concourse are cute but the food/grills are across from them with lines on both side so you have to say excuse me, excuse me, excuse me as you cut through more than a hundred people in line just to get through the concourse.\n\nThe view from 218 where we sat was blocked by railings, speakers, etc.  218 here is like 300 at Rexall (think nosebleeds).\n\nThe lower bowl (100s) is huge and I'm stoked to sit there tomorrow night for Dolly Parton.\n\nThere is a PCL Loge lounge level with swanky seating and tables that you can purchase as season tix or if a season ticket holder decides not to buy their table for any given concert.\n\nThe staff were friendly and ample tonight.\n\nMerch was available for purchase outside security, main concourse, and on the top level (200's) - pretty cool and no lines upstairs. \n\n2 thumbs way up for having water fountains!\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to coming here again but glad we had dinner beforehand!",

There's no better place in the area to warm up on a snowy winter day!\n\nUpon arrival this afternoon, Marsha greeted us and urged us to take seats. We then started our tasting of their current selection for $5. I was especially excited, as I'm a big fruity, sweet wine drinker and that's a big chunk of their offerings.\n\nWe began with the 2010 Cabernet Franc (winner of the 2013 Governor's Cup Award for best overall grape wine in the Garden State Wine Growers Competition.) It was deep and dry -- not what I'm used to at all, but it was good! Next was Merlot, which was also exceptional.\n\nNow! To my favorite part!\n\nBlueberry wine. \nCherry wine. \nStrawberry wine. \nNectarine wine. \nApple wine. \n!!!!\n\nAnd yes, there is such a thing as \"Nectarine wine.\" I've heard of peach, but this was a new one for me. I snagged a bottle, as well as bottles of cherry and strawberry, which tasted like they were just picked from the tree/field.\n\nHalfway through our tasting, Marsha asked if we wanted to see their production area where her husband Ed was busily working, then animatedly told us all about how they make their wine, which was really neat to hear! I've been to production areas for much larger wineries, but not when it's a two-person operation with the help of friends.\n\nTo note: They are RIGHT off the Repaupo exit of Route 295. No excuses not to visit. The winery is so easy to find.\n\nThis was just such a sweet, cozy winery, and I wish them all the luck in the future. Can't wait to go back!",

I had their yuzu shoyu -- a chicken broth base -- with shrimp. I think it would have been better with pork or chicken, though there was a lot of shrimp. And a lot of noodles and bamboo shoots along with seaweed, fish cake slices, and a half boiled egg.  I asked for added bok choy but they gave me regular cabbage instead. No problem, I like cabbage too. The bowls are large and had we not been staying at a hotel, I would have taken leftovers home. \n\nAs they'd opened during 2020 (at the beginning of the pandemic), we'd never been here before.

Wait time wasn't terrible for dinner..\n\nTried the chowder, some oysters, and the ahi tuna. Right along the water and casual all the way... perfect for those who want an easy meal without walking up to State street, in order to return to the water for more ocean kayaking!!!\n\nCan't say that anything was outstanding, but memorable and a good experience.",

  "text": "Delicious! We stopped by for dinner last night and left happy and full! Birrieria y Taquaria Arandas is in the old Zulema's Taqueria on Graylynn Drive in Donelson. It's small inside (just 2-3 tables, I think), but they added some outside seating (picnic tables) as well. We ordered at the counter and enjoyed our meal outside at one of the picnic tables.\n\nLet's talk birria. It's a Mexican dish from Jalisco, and it's essentially meat stewed and served with consomme/soup. Growing up, I learned that birria was goat meat, but usually in the States you're talking beef. (I've only ever seen beef in Nashville.) And quesabirria? Take a tortilla (large or small depending on if it's taco style or quesadilla style), dip it in the consomme, place it on the grill with lots of the cheese and the birria inside, let it get crispy. Then it's served with a cup of consomme to dip the taco/quesadilla into. There are obviously lots of ways/variations of this dish. But in case you haven't had it before but have been hearing a lot about it (isn't quesabirria everywhere all of a sudden!??!? YUM), I thought this might be a helpful dumbed down explanation. \n\nSo, of course, we got the quesabirria. Their version was quesadilla style (if they make taco versions I didn't see it on the menu). The consomme was delicious, and the quesadilla was a great cheesy/gooey mess - just what I wanted. The quesadilla didn't stay on the grill long enough to get crispy or browned at all which was my own complaint - because it made a bit more difficult to eat (dipping a soft, pliable slice of quesadilla into the consomme required some skill - did I have enough??). But a delicious, comforting, yummy dish. The plate came with frijoles, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, slices of cucumber, and lime. \n\nWe also got their chicken plate (you can choose whole, half, or three piece chicken - we did the three piece). Their chicken was simple, delicious, with crispy skin, and really good grill/char flavor. A simple dish that I could eat all the time. The plate came with frijoles, rice, lettuce, pico de gallo, slices of cucumber, and some corn tortillas. \n\nThis was a meal I'd happily repeat. This is delicious comfort food to me. And that consomme! Check it out. There are a few places where you can find quesabirria in Nashville now - but this little spot in Donelson is making a yummy version.",

My friend had their strawberry kale salad and I had the enchiladas chile verde. The salad was amazing, one of the best kale salads I have ever had. The enchiladas on the other hand weren't so great. They seemed pretty bland - perhaps the cook wasn't having a bad day?\n\nAt the end we split the pecan pie which was AMAZING! You have to try it. My friend also got a chocolate chip cookie which was quite hard. She said it didn't taste too good.\n\nI would say try this place out if you are a healthy eater and/or a vegetarian/vegan. The prices are quite high. You could go to a fairly high end restaurant at these prices. But then again, it is vegan and gluten free which are costly eats. The decor inside is pretty cool too - it's almost like being in someone's house while having lunch or dinner.",

  "text": "Flatbread is a pretty little Pizzeria in Bown Crossing.  Went with a group and were seated promptly and served with friendly efficiency.  The atmosphere is cozy (while not being overly small).  The food was solid.  I ordered their lasagna (as did 2 of my dining companions) and was pleased--huge portion and tasty.  Another of my dining companions ordered their pot roast and potato flatbread and said it was scrumptious. \n\nI was very excited when I eyed a blood orange margarita on their menu (one of my very favorite sorts of 'ritas) and was disappointed to find out they actually don't serve it at this location due the lack of a liquor license.  Upon further discussion with our server, found out that only one liquor license is allowed in all of Bown (which goes to the Tavern).  I guess the reasoning was (as our server explained to us) that they wanted to give businesses the highest chance of success (minimizing the competition for booze).  This seems utterly ridiculous.  I'm certain a pizza joint offering a few specialty cocktails won't destroy business at the Tavern, just as having multiple eateries hasn't seemed to cause a problem for any of them.  Competition is a good thing.  Without it, you could end up with the only cocktails offered being overpriced and over-hyped.  It's definitely not Flatbread's fault that they are unable to obtain a liquor license.  However, if you don't offer cocktails--you should probably remove them from the menu.\n\nOther than that, an solid experience.  Will definitely be giving their downtown location a whirl as I want to try one of their flatbreads and their blood orange margarita!",

  "text": "February 12, 2012 Sunday - dinner 6:15 PM\n2 adults & a kid\n\nAtmosphere - 4 stars\nFood - 4 stars\nService - 5 stars\n\nBackground - Yep another one of those online deals.  If you are already planning on going or want to try a new place what a great way to save some money.  I would love to hit at every pizza joint in town.  I know it will take a long time, but I like this idea more I think about it.\n\nAtmosphere - Wow the first this I noticed was an old clay pigeon hunting game on the wall.  Wow that just brought back a bunch of memories.  The place is fairly good size and the bar was off by itself.  I even played a game of air hockey with my daughter after dinner; I did not let her win.  They had a variety of tables including several larger tables that had large picnic style benches, great for big groups and kids.  The menu board left of the register does not give much detail on what the specialty pizzas are other than name.  They had a lamented colored menu next to register that gave that kind of detailed information.  So if there is no line, just skip that big board and go for that hand held menu.\n\nFood\n  Appetizer - They do have a small salad bar but none for me today.\n\n  Main Course - We went with a large 15\" half Boulevard Combo and half cheese.  They paged us overhead when the pizza was done.  The have a huge knife, to cut the pizza, maybe not large enough for that 15\" pizza as one section did not have the crust cut.  The only thing was wrong with the pizza this night.  I love the sausage with that pizza.  The sauce was not over powering, and just the right amount under the cheese.  I might want to try just a sausage pizza as eating them by themselves of the pizza sheet was yummy.  The crust was thinker but still nice and crisp, a nice combination.\n\n  Dessert - I admit it I ate too much pizza. \n\nService - Very friendly service and no attitude about having the LivingSocial deal.  He had no issues handling it that coupon.  It almost paid for the three of us completely.\n\nFuture - Yeah if I am in this area I will go back for more.",

  "text": "Rob did such a great job on both the apartment's carpet and car seats! I appreciated the quality of 3-D's services as well as his positive and friendly demeanor. No matter how hot it was, how stained the car's floor carpet was, or having to navigate our apartment's maze with his equipment he was professional and personable the whole time. \n\nAfter reading yelp reviews for a couple different carpet cleaning services, including Kim's excellent review, I reached out to about four companies that serve the Miami area for quotes and availability. I chose Rob from 3-D because he had a clear and professional response to my yelp message and he agreed to steam clean our car.\n\nOur landlord required us to get the carpet cleaned upon moving out, so the day after the movers had taken everything from the apartment Rob arrived for our appointment. He did a walk through of the place, and he noticed a water stain on the carpet that I didn't even know was a water stain. He thoroughly cleaned all the carpet areas and every room had perfect triangles from his steam cleaner. After he was finished, we turned on all the ceiling fans and put down towels in traffic areas. The carpet was remarkably dry after just a few hours. I would still avoid walking on it for a day or two as much as possible, but it dried impressively. When the carpet was fully dry, it got back to its original softness. Also, the carpet was virtually odorless. I'm allergic to strong fragrances, so I was a little worried beforehand. But I had NO problem with my allergies. If you do have allergies, then I recommend Rob's company because not only will your carpet be much cleaner, but you don't have to worry about any strong odors.\n\nI was thrilled with Rob's work on the car seats and floors. He greatly reduced a large stain on the car's carpet floor that had been there for years. He was even able to clean the driver's seat headrest very well. It had gotten shiny and kind of hard over the years (I know gross) but he got it back to a normal, soft car seat texture. The car seats looked great! \n\nThanks again Rob for great customer service!",

Now, he's wondering IF Dr. Pomeroy will be similiar and if he'll remain in extreme pain for several more weeks trying to find yet another surgeon.  I have to admit, I was extremely nervous for him. Who wants someone cutting on you if you don't like or trust them? No one!! \n\nRELIEF!! Dr. Pomeroy was amazing with my friend AND us. He was warm, personable,  professional, discussed and answered EVERY question everyone had while speaking with a calm but confident tone. I could see the stress literally leave his body as Dr. Pomeroy spoke. My friend was so relieved and grateful as we were leaving the office. Don't get me wrong, he's still anxious about going under the knife as a high risk patient. The difference now is he feels confident with Dr. Pomeroys' surgical skills along with finding the personality type he can work with for this next upcoming journey.\n\nI normally wouldn't post a review before surgery since we have a ways to go. However, the amount of relief and peace Dr. Pomeroy brought my friend today was amazing to watch. Yes, he'll still be in excruciating pain for a short while but he now realizes the end is in sight with a surgeon he likes and trusts.\n\nI can honestly say don't hestitate for a minute to schedule an appointment with Dr. Pomeroy and Ortho Indy Northwest.",

The place is tucked in the back of Erin Rose so definitely a hole in the wall feel. We ordered a pork belly poboy to split between the 3 of us since we were still full from our last meal. As we waited, we grabbed some drinks at the bar. The food came out and man did I wish I hadn't eaten so much earlier! Such a good sandwich with a thick cut of meat and the sauce was perfection for not being too sweet. The other toppings give the sandwich a crunchy texture. I would definitely eat more if I could!",

  "text": "I love this zoo. It does get pretty busy though. I would highly recommend that you go during the week or in the late afternoon as everyone else is leaving. Everyone always thinks that the best time to go is in the morning. Don't go in the morning, everyone arrives in the morning. \n\nI highly recommend buying the membership. Parking ($16) is free and you pretty much pay for the membership if you go at least twice in a year. I like the idea of the membership because I don't feel like I'm wasting money by just going to the zoo for a couple hours vs the entire day. Most visits we only see about half or less of the animals and get outta there. We see the other half during the next visit. \n\nPACK YOUR OWN FOOD AND DRINKS!!!\n\nYou're allowed to bring food into the zoo. Don't be that person who spends $12 on a meal (I'm guilty of this every single time I visit the zoo). You can save so much money by bringing your own food. Pick up a small carry cooler from target and a couple of ice packs, you're good to go.",

  "text": "We were staying at the attached hotel, Cambria, so upon wondering in one night from Broadway, we decided it would be the easiest thing to grab some night caps and snacks before heading up stairs. NashHouse's theme and menu are very similar to many other places in this area Nashville, with the live music and the southern fare based menu. \n\nFood: While we didn't have a full meal, we did get the Bacon Queso dip that came with unlimited chips. I couldn't really tell if it was fully infused with bacon or the bacon pieces crumbled on top gave it the \"bacon\". Either way, it was a decent bowl of cheese dip that certainly hit the spot. In addition to the app, my partner got the banana pudding - two thumbs up from him! \n\nDrinks: We both got cocktails, one was a house specialty and the other was a basic Gin & Tonic. No major complaints here, they came out quick, cold and FULL of liquor. The bartender was certainly not shy with their pours! \n\nService: This is where things became a slight bummer for me. As mentioned above, the place was not packed and there seemed to be several wait staff working the floor. However, when it came to our waiter, he seemed rushed, disinterested and disconnected with our experience as a whole. Once we were sat, it took several minutes for him to swing by and get our initial order. During this conversation, he was clearly distracted and rushed, as when asked about a particular drink he answered with vague \"yeah, sure\" and \"I think its good\". Additionally, during our entire 1 hour visit, he came by twice. It wasn't a total experience derailer by any means, but it was certainly frustrating. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed the music, our drinks, the queso and dessert. It's a solid restaurant with a great location and given the chance of us staying at Cambria on a future trip to Nashville, we would certainly swing again.",

  "text": "There is a lot of potential at Pearl Diver. The interior is gorgeous and well-themed and the outdoor space makes you feel that you are transported to an island. Plus I love the cabanas and the overall vibe is really cool and interesting. \nHowever, there were some pretty significant issues. First, you have to order at the bar or window connected to the outdoor space. I definitely had more luck at the bar, but just come here planning to wait to order. That alone isn't a dealbreaker though. I'm fine to wait if I'm getting some interesting drinks and delicious food. Unfortunately Pearl Diver didn't deliver there either. While the port to port cocktail was delicious, it only tasted like fruit juice and was very weak. If I'm paying $12 I want it to taste like an adult beverage. I tried the Paloma later and it was better but also very weak and mostly ice. I was excited about the food but bummed when the mushroom and shishito peppers came out with a laughable amount. There were seriously 5 of them on a skewer and the mushrooms were a huge let down and not worth $9 for these items. Luckily the dumplings and dipping sauce were good so it wasn't a total waste. \nAt the end of our night we enjoyed talking to the bartender and sampled a shot of the daiquiri which was delicious and what I should have ordered instead of the other fruit heavy beverages I sampled. The bottom line is that I paid $50 leaving hungry and completely sober which makes me grumpy. Luckily I was hanging out with an awesome group of ladies so it wasn't a total loss but I'm not rushing back, especially since it's the new place to be and super popular. Maybe they know something I don't?",

  "text": "Moved here from the French Quarter because we had an early flight to catch the next morning and the price was right. While my stay and room wasn't as disastrous as some of these other Yelp reviewers (OMG the holes in the ceiling would've been the last straw for me!), there was one huge problem with the room that I can't overlook. \n\nSo this place has those damn motion sensor air conditioning units. Usually Hilton properties have the Inncom brand thermostats which are easy to override to a VIP setting (just Google it) so you can disable the motion sensor and keep your room cool. This Garden Inn had an Amana brand that you can't disable. I'm sorry, in hot and humid New Orleans, I should be able to have my a/c running nonstop if I choose. It is not acceptable to have the temperature reset to 74 degrees at night. I woke up multiple times drenched in sweat. Who can sleep in a 74 degree room? \n\nOther than the a/c issue I was just fine here. The rooms are comfortable enough (except for the outrageously warm temperature) and the staff was friendly (though not polished in the least). My room had a useful small refrigerator, microwave and Keurig coffee maker in it. Lots of free parking if you have a rental car, and off the beaten path a bit so there's not a lot of traffic or noise. As a diamond level Hilton Hhonors member I was handed a big chocolate chip cookie at check-in which was nice (it wasn't that great, Doubletree is the master at the check-in cookie, but I still appreciated the friendly gesture). \n\nI would never, ever stay at this property again, and it's a true blemish to the Hilton chain. I should've refused to pay my bill because I think a hotel should offer basic amenities in their room rate: a shower, toilet, running water, bed and a COOL ROOM! So beware if you are hot natured: go ahead and cancel your reservation and look elsewhere, because you will be MISERABLE here.",

Man it was good. The porkchop was just a little on the dry side, but it had sat waiting for me, so I couldn't fault it. The flavor was spot on. So good. I get the feeling that some things on the menu are not as good as others, so you have to be discerning and lucky to catch a superlative but otherwise the remainder of the choices seemed quite solid.

After working out as a guest at Elmwood Fitness Center, one of my girlfriends and I were starving and ate here.  Since it was an amazing night we sat outside which was wonderful because we had the tables to ourselves.  And the hostess was super sweet after she tried to seat me at one table inside, then I asked to move to another table, then my girlfriend didn't see me so I sat outside and I moved again!  She took it all in stride.\n\nSo one of the specials was half bottle night so we picked a chardonnay and shared it.  It even had a screw top which made it convenient to bring it home.  Another awesome item on their menu is where you can order three different types of sushi for like $13 and it includes miso soup and a salad!  What?  So both of us got that deal. All I remembered was that I ordered the salmon avocado roll, a second one with salmon and I forgot the third roll. They were all tasty!\n\nAnd I totally forgot the appetizer but it's a tender fish that was falling off the bone! Delish!\n\nOne thing my gf taught me was to use ponzu sauce instead of soy sauce with sushi and it's better flavor! Worked for me!\n\nHappy Japanese food eating!",

Notably, they offer unlimited toppings for one (low) price, which even as someone who has no interest in half the toppings always makes me feel better. You can get a one- or no-topping pizza for even cheaper if the build doesn't interest you. They offer online ordering (though their app is somewhat ornery) and seemed to have a pretty smooth process and plenty of people working.\n\nThe default pizza is a super-thin crust. You can pay for more crust, which I'm fine with, but do note that the thin one struggles to hold toppings. The topping selection is decent, if not possessing much exciting or unique (notably, vegan cheese is available for those who need it). Mine was palatable, not exceptional, but certainly worth it for what I paid and how long I waited. A brownie (which I got free through some online offer) was soft and delicious.\n\nIt struck me as odd that this place is on a stretch of restaurants with at least two other pizza places (which I've also reviewed), but they are all quite different. This one is a nice fast food option, and one that I may return to.",

Tavern is definitely my favorite of the M street concepts (Virago, Whiskey Kitchen, etc.)\n\nI got their red sangria for both of my brunch drinks and my friend got the peach bellini both times as well. I got the Benedict Uno which has short rib and poached eggs on an English muffin with a Tabasco hollandaise. I wasn't sure if I would like the hollandaise so I ordered it on the side. I actually really loved the sauce but it was so rice that I am glad it was on the side. The short rib was tasty albeit just a tad dry but the hollandaise fixed that. My friend got the Benedict Dos. This has smoked salmon and poached eggs on an English muffin with a caper hollandaise. This was so yummy. I had a bite of hers and then I wanted more. \n\nI got to give a shoutout to our server, Tim. He was so nice and friendly and provided us with exceptional service. Two other staff members came around to check on us too, so I was just really impressed with the service all around. \n\nA great casual brunch spot with something for everyone.

  "text": "M.L. Rose markets themselves as a good neighborhood pub and gathering place. The owner is a Nashville-native and has a clear vision for making this to be a quality pub experience with still the element of being casual and accessible. \n\nM.L. Rose really doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you get inside you are pleasantly surprised by the fun atmosphere. This review is for the Melrose location, although there is one in Sylvan Park and one soon to be opened in the Gulch. Although it is a casual place to get a beer and a burger, the ambiance draws you in with the spacious area and the booth seating around the bar. They also have a cool-looking patio outside. They do have plenty of TVs for watching any sports game that is on as well. \n\nI was most impressed by their beer menu. Their Spring menu included a lot of good craft beers which is easy to tell what it is because they separate them into categories on the menu. They do have a lot of local and Tennessee beers but they also have an array of other craft beers like Lagunitas and Sierra Nevada. \n\nTheir food menu is mostly burgers (I mean that is their thing!) but they do have sandwiches, wraps, salads and appetizers. I ended up getting the buffalo chicken wrap since it sounded so enticing, with the premise that I could try some of my companion's NashVegas. Both were fantastic! The NashVegas is served on a sweet potato bun which makes for a unique touch. The burgers and sandwiches come with a choice of side, so we both ordered the waffle fries. I don't know what it is about waffle fries but they are one of my favorite things. When I learned that M.L. Rose served waffle fries they automatically got elevated in my mind. \n\nAll in all, this is no typical local pub. They have great service, good food and an amazing selection of beer.",

  "text": "Our adventures continue into Santa Barbara, downtown on State street, and my craving for thai food led us to this super tiny restaurant with interesting bright yellow and red decor with blue grey checkerboard tile.  My, what a cornucopia of colors. Yeah, it was all very interesting to take in.  You walk in and there are only a handful of tables, a small waiting area (literally right near the door), and some restrooms and that's it!  I think the place was as big as the living room in my apartment and I live in a 900 sq ft apartment.\n\nConsidering there were only a handful of tables, the place was packed.  That's a good sign.  Food must be wonderful, right?  We wanted to take our chances but the hostess was a little rude and almost turned us away because she had nowhere for us to sit and we had no reservations but I insisted on eating there and get my name on a list.  After 20 minutes, we were called in and given the best seat in the place, a lone table facing out the window to view all that Santa Barbara had to offer us.\n\nWe started off with water, thai iced tea (it's a must have if you're visiting a thai restaurant!) and coke that arrived with a glass of ice and a real coke can!  None of that fountain drink stuff here.  That in itself was worth noting.  My thai iced tea was the perfect blend of black tea and condensed milk.  \n\nThat night, we feasted on Chicken Curry, Chicken Pad Thai, and Chicken Fried Rice with green curry.  Yes, all chicken.  I have yet to develop the rest of my flexitarian (a vegetarian that occasionally eats meat) side.   I expected a brighter yellow sauce for the chicken curry but I'm guessing they did away with the food coloring as an additive and gave us the real deal with the coconut curry.  I appreciate that.  The pad thai was perfect.  Not greasy and just right and the spicy fried rice was the highlight of the night and a burst of flavors for my palate.  \n\nThis place is recommended for anyone looking for thai food in the Santa Barbara area.  It's small so make some advance preparations or prepare to wait, either way you won't be disappointed.",

We talked about some future ideas for meetups and about the Yelp scene in Miami-a cool thing to learn about.\n\nWest Tampa Sandwich Shop is pretty awesome. The aroma when you come in is heavenly. I ordered a steak sandwich, which was nice and juicy. The vegetables on it were fresh and the bread was pressed just right. The french fries were golden and cooked enough to be crispy, but still soft. I also tried their plantain chips, which were decent. I ordered a Mango shake, and although the waitress initially gave me the wrong order, she was really quick and kind about changing it back to the right one. The food wasn't too heavy, but still filling.\n\nI love the atmosphere in the restaurant though. It's like you're dining at home (the place looks like a house after all both on the inside and outside). It's a true Spanish diner in every sense of the name. You can tell who is a local, a regular, and just visiting...and that's part of the cool factor here.",

  "text": "What a fun experience!\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I had to drag my boyfriend here for the Italian Feast hosted on Fridays and Saturdays. Reservations only! A quick phone call with a follow-up e-mail confirmed our reservation.\n\nMangia Nashville is located in a shopping center with its own parking lot, making parking a breeze. Upon entering, we were greeted and sat at a communal table with several other patrons. This is a family-style dinner experience so don't be shy! Decor features photography from The Godfather and they also play the film on silent throughout the 3-hour dining experience. \n\nThe waitstaff are all fantastic. Our main hostess had a great sense of humor and helped us newbies understand how everything worked. She was so funny! They also kept the wine flowing and kept us dancing and singing the whole night!\n\nThey are currently featuring the Winter Menu with a seasonal menu that rotates quarterly. Every dish was well done. Highlights were the shrimp saltimbocca stuffed portobello mushroom (I wanted a bowl full!), eggplant caponata, porcini cognac cream sauce penne pasta, veal osso buco with creamy polenta, and the tiramisu! Can you believe this wasn't even HALF the menu? You will not leave hungry or disappointed. The variety and amount of food was definitely worth the price ($50 per person without gratuity or tax). Honestly, it's a bargain! You can take any leftovers from the table to-go. \n\nNow, the dancing and singing was my favorite part! I honestly wish there was more of it. It definitely got me burning off the 10000+ calories I had just consumed and help make room for more food. You will be lead through hilarious dance moves and find yourself singing at the top of your lungs to old favorites. \n\nCome hungry! Wear your stretchy pants and dancing shoes! Get ready to meet some new people and have a blast! I'm looking forward to trying the spring menu starting in April!",

  "text": "This Beefs is getting a bad rap on Yelp, but my experience last Sunday afternoon was nearly flawless.  Quick, attentive service along with hot and freshly prepared food amounted to a very satisfying experience.\n\nI was craving the turkey bacon brioche sandwich that I've enjoyed at other Beefs locations.  It was a sweltering hot afternoon, and I desperately needed a break from the heat and the amount of terrible fried fast foods I had consumed on previous days.  However, much to my dismay, the sandwich was not on the menu.  Did they rename it?  Was it a special?  Are only certain locations offering it?  SO MANY QUESTIONS!!!\n\nOur waitress brought us our drinks, and I inquired about the sammich.  She advised me that it has been removed, but that she can still have the cooks whip one up for me.  Special requests make me nervous like a Chihuahua during a Florida thunderstorm.  I always envision the cook back there like, \"I got your special order right here, buddy\" while performing some foul act with my food.  But I like the sandwich that much, and was willing to risk it.  I'm glad I did too because it was perfect and solved all the problems of the day. \n\nI should mention that we did order an appetizer that was forgotten.  Our waitress had a rush order put in, so we ate it with our meals as a side and she removed it from the bill, despite our repeated requests to pay for it.\n\nWould definitely return!",

I have to add the caveat that I tried the Café Bombon and the pastry on different days. I'm unsure if I would have been able to eat the two together. I may have died and gone to sugary heaven. If you get the option, get the pastry heated. When it's cold the cream cheese becomes a block. I'm honestly fine with eating giant hunks of cream cheese, but I know the general population tends to like a smaller dose. The Café Bombon is definitely a shock to your system. It is perfectly sweet and wakes you up! \n\nI was in the coworking space next door for two days. It's the epitome of no muss no fuss. There are two conference rooms in the back and they were perfect for soaking in tons of knowledge for two days straight. There is a moderate amount of people in the front space and they all seem very respectful of each other. I would definitely recommend working here. You won't get the frills of colorful walls or high tech gadgetry, but if all you need is you, a buddy, and a laptop, this place works well. \n\nI think this is a great place to get coffee in Ybor. The atmosphere is cool, the coffee is good, and the workers are personable. Two thumbs up!",

It was more of a wading area and there was more space for the kayaks.  \n\nIt's nice to have an option, but for $20, i don't think it's worth it. For $10, I say it is.\n\nIt would be very cool if they had festivals here, and July 4th and holiday fireworks. That would be so much fun. I would go for that.\n\nThere is food but it was minimal. Two vendors with cuban sandwiches and hot dogs, and a stand for alcohol until the bar was complete. The bar is really cool and also it it where you can sit inside or sit on the side of the bar in the water. That will be a cool spot!\n\nEpperson lagoon is very pretty. It does look paradise like. It's super convenient for me and you can really feel like you are on a getaway, but price wise I'm still leaving towards my number 1 Clearwater Beach, but nothing can compare and they are still apples to oranges!",

There is another taco sheriff in town and he's serving up some mean tacos!  Oh wait, the place is named Lilly's.  Okay, SHE'S serving up some mean tacos!  \n\nThis was one of the few taco joints open on Easter when I was craving Mexican food.  La Super Rica was closed.  Lilly's is located a block off of State St. in a semi-deserted shopping area.  Not many taco places were open on this day (but a lot of shops and other restaurants were) but Lilly's was smart to be in business.  Crowded with mostly locals eating inside.  Good sign!\n\nThere tacos include roasted beef, marinated pork, steamed beef, cow head, cow cheek, cow lip, cow tongue and cow eye.  I admittedly went safe with the asada and marinated pork..2 each.  And yummy they were!  Fresh, good helpings of both meat and cilantro/onions.  I ate four but should have ordered two more.\n\nLimited drink menu but they do have the yummy Mexican coke.  A new find whenever I'm in SB!  And next time I'll try other cow parts!  Highly recommended!",

I came with Matt B. and his dad for some pancakes on a chilly Sunday morning, and it was pretty nice despite the brisk breeze. We had our dog with us on the patio, and he spent most of our meal getting petted by the most adorable nine-year-old twin boys. They vowed to distract him from our food, and they did an excellent job.\n\nThe place was busy but not quite full, and we had no problem seating ourselves. We ordered at the counter and the food was brought to our tables. Very easy.\n\nWe all ordered pancakes, which is apparently the thing to get at East Beach Grill. I got the banana wheat germ pancakes with sides of bacon and eggs. The pancakes were delicious, fluffy yet substantial, studded through with sweet morsels of banana. I got my eggs over easy and these were fine, nothing special, and the bacon was not as satisfying as bacon should be. Really, the pancakes are the main attraction.\n\nAll of us, dog included, enjoyed our visit to East Beach Grill. It's a great spot for a lovely scenic breakfast, and I'd recommend it if you want some oceanside pancakes.",

This QT is a prime location - it has easy access on and off of 44 and is just a hop, skip and a jump from 64/40. \n\nI'm driving to work earlier then most people get up for work and a convenience market is important to me. It may be a gas station, but their selection and variety of coffee satisfies my need for caffeine. This new location is one that has the kitchen in the center, I can't wait to try it. However, for now I can tell you, if you need a quick breakfast their 99¢ Sausage Biscuit will hit the spot and fill the void. \n\nThe staff seems to be friendly and professional and if they can do that in the wee hours of the morning - they've got a good team. \n\nWill I return? Yes - I've fallen out of love with my current gas station and convenience store. \n\nWhen: March 25, 2017\nWhy: It's new and I needed coffee.",

Before my couple of trips to St. Louis, I was scratching my head whenever viewing photos of this building and the famous arch. Wondering what was a capital building doing in St. Louis? Not realizing that it was a courthouse; a very historic courthouse. \n\nBuilt in 1828, the Old Courthouse is most noted for the Dred Scott case that took place here in 1847, after Mr. Scott and his wife Harriet sued for their freedom. The case was Scott v. Emerson. The verdict went against him and his family. Study your history to refresh your memory of this American history lesson, that went back and forth for many years we all studied in school... Or should have.\n\nOn walking through this building, one can feel the years of courtroom drama. There is a great exhibit on the history of the Dred Scott case and his family, with rare photos and artifacts. Almost an eerie feeling came over me at times, because you can almost find yourself alone as you wander the floors. There are courtrooms furnished to their 19th century period and you can walk a good ways into them. Various plaques commemorate some of the standout events that have taken place here, but they have lost track of the actual Scott v. Emerson courtroom. Only speculating where it may have taken place. A fascinating walk through an important landmark of America's past.\n\nOn a lighter note, there is an interesting souvenir shop and tickets to the Gateway Arch can also be purchased here.",

Iris has some wonderful bartenders who are knowledgeable and personable. \n\nThis review is based solely on the bar.

I selected two slices of pizza, grabbed my mom a plain cheese slice, and then selected a couple desserts for us.\n\nThe checkout area looks like it would be self service, but it's not.\n\nBoth pizza slices I had were pretty bland. The four cheese tasted and looked like a plain white. Hardly caught any pronounced cheese notes. The chicken and broccoli alfredo was stacked high but the quality didn't match. My mom said the plain cheese slice was nothing to write home about as well.\n\nFor dessert, I was told the coconut snowball wasn't great at all. The chocolate lava cake was pretty decent warmed up though.\n\nI feel like this would be a great place for group outings or kids birthday parties.

There are plenty of seats -- so much so that it looks like a cafeteria.\n\nStaff members were friendly and answered all my questions. The food came out promptly. Nothing was downright poor, but it wasn't a meal to remember.\n\nAlso, Yelp, please update the business name. I tried to edit it but you guys didn't accept my changes.

Each person, though, has a strong passion for poultry. And no woman that night wanted to eat with us.\n\nTo control for as many variables as possible, we tried a mild flavored chicken breast at each one. This test did not take into account service, ambiance, and decor, or prices. It also did not factor into the overall ranking. \n\nBolton's sat at second in our ultimate power rankings. \n\nCriteria and corresponding scores below:\n\n*Spice (4/5): Fantastic spice with a lingering yo-this-stuff-sits-in-the-back-of-my-throat kick. Like many other Nashville Hot Chickens, they use a dry rub, but you know the folks in the kitchen let those breasts and legs marinate. \n\n*Meat Juiciness (4/5): Juicy and savory. Almost pornographic. \n\n*Skin (4/5): Crispy, but not the crispiest. It complimented the meat well, but I wouldn't say memorable.\n\nOverall Score: 4/5\n\nOther tidbits:\n- I asked a native-born construction worker ahead of me if Bolton's was his favorite place, for Nashville Hot Chicken. He said, no. However, he recommended their white fish.\n\n- I tasted their white fish, which is sandwiched in between two slices of white bread and mustard, and I would recommend this over their Nashville Hot Chicken.\n\n- The spice level is higher than what most people can endure. I ain't like most people, though. #asianfolkslovethemsomespice\n\n- The service is slow, but so is the rest of the South.\n\n- Feel free to watch NBA basketball on the TV in the corner.\n\n- The toilet paper roll sits super high up in the men's bathroom.",

I was excited because I knew he did things right, especially nigiri.\n\nNext I noticed a section of the menu dedicated to \"Specialty Nigiri\"! The salmon rooster and salmon lover were both fantastic. One of them is topped with crispy salmon skin, my favorite ingredient! The Kei Tuna is also no to be missed on this section! \n\nOf course, we ordered some of the standard nigiri, and all of these were perfect. Fresh fish, solid fish:rice ratio, and the rice was also nicely seasoned. The albacore was a little mushy on both visits, so I think I'd just skip that one in the future.\n\nOn the dinner menu they have some really special rolls. Tres Diablos, with pickled jalapenos, was wonderful. I think the biggest surprise though had to be the Great White, with escolar, macadamia nuts, and a sweet mayo sauce. Freaking fantastic. I thought I'd hate it but it has been my favorite thus far! \n\nBe sure not to miss the Alligator, salmon skin hand rolll, and Jason hand roll! Plus, ask your chef for their special! They also have a big section of vegetarian rolls! GREAT JOB! And if you like it spicy, ask for the habanero sauce. But beware! \n\nSo with all this love, why 4 stars? Consistency from chef to chef is of utmost importance to me when it comes to a sushi spot. On my second visit I wanted to wait for Jesus, but was encouraged to sit with another chef. While his maki and hand rolls were good, his nigiri was lacking, and just not as clean or composed as Jesus. \n\nI'm sure they're still getting the staff tuned up, so I bet this will fade over time. They've asked for some honest feedback on both occasions, offering a cool comment card at the end of the meal. \n\nA restaurant that appreciates feedback gets bonus points in my book. Kei, Welcome to Reno! I have a feeling you'll be here a long time!",

Staff as friendly and helpful with all the tech and more to boot! \n\nBathrooms were tidy, coffee was plentiful as were sodas and waters throughout the day, and it's walkable to the City Market which makes taking a tasty lunch break easy to do. \n\nNot just a work space either.

Especially if you like sours. The staff is knowledgable on good beer and very attentive. Prices are responsible. I had a pint of Ballast Point Dorado for $5 tonight. They also had Funky Buddha Last Snow on tap this evening. There is a private parking lot, plenty of seating, music at all times and happy hour during the week. They serve great food especially the pizzas and sings. Watch for bbq specials that are amazing! Dive bar that is somewhat upscale. I love this place :)",

That being said, we arrived to no one on the floor.  So we sat ourselves and waited for 10-15 minutes before anyone came out to see if there were customers.  We were given menus.  The server disappeared into the kitchen.  10-15 minutes later she came out for our drink orders.  10-15 minutes later (yup...get the pattern??  ;-) she came back with our drinks.  Unfortunately people were still deciding on food.  10 minutes later (improvement!) she took our order.  20 minutes or more later it all started to come out in pieces.  \n\nEverything was as we'd ordered it.  We were eventually asked about refills.  We eventually got the check.  We eventually were able to pay.  We eventually got our cards back.  And our server was very nice throughout it all.\n\nThat being said, if I'm going to spend over $20 for pizza and spend more than 2 hours in a restaurant, I'll go some place a little more upscale.",

In fact, I ate majority of the ribs without adding any sauce because it was so good just by itself!  Of course, I had to compare it to Pappy's since I think Pappy's has the best ribs, and I gotta say, it's pretty damn close.  It's not as tender as Pappy's but I think flavor-wise it might edge Pappy's just a bit!\n\nAlso a huge fan of the wings here.  It's smokey, juicy, and straight up addicting.  Since we were sharing the wings, I was so tempted to go back and order some more, but the long got really long :P\n\nAs for the sides, everything we tried were great!  The deviled egg potato salad is very unique.  First time I've had both potato and egg salad together.  The baked beans are smokey and sweet, and the BBQ pork skins was like eating crack.  For the pork skins, aka pork rinds, one of the guys working there told us to use the vinegar-based sauce with it and holy, it is good.  The pork skins are seasoned with seasoned salt so it's like eating pork-flavored salt & vinegar chips!  Awesome combo.\n\nI think I still like Pappy's ribs more just because I like fattier cuts of ribs, but BBQ restaurant as a whole, Bogart definitely beats Pappy's any day.  Pappy's sides can't even compare to Bogart's and Bogart's menu is just more fun and adventurous!  No wonder it was rated the #1 BBQ spot in the US by Zagat!",

There's no doubt this is a very popular restaurant and we were excited for our first meal in town. \n\nAfter talking to a few folks in line, browsing Yelp pictures and perusing the menu, we opted to get the seafood and chicken andouille gumbo (award winning) plus an order of Jambalaya. \n\nWe were seated by a window, which offered us a good opportunity for people watching. Service was quick - water, bread and refills were offered in no time. \n\nThe gumbo itself wasn't what it was hyped up to be. In my opinion, the gumbo felt watered down, greasy and felt like there weren't enough chunks of meat. The seafood one was pretty bland and didn't feel special at all. The andouille gumbo offered a bit of spice and better texture... but wasn't enough to blow my mind. \n\nThe Jambalaya wasn't that great as well. The rice felt like it had been cooking a tad too long and had an overcooked feel to it. There wasn't much meat in it either and it honestly just felt like I was served a few scoops of rice. \n\nAll in all, not the best meal we had in New Orleans. Service was great, but the food left me wanting more.",

The worst part is that because it's free and there is an amazing lineup with tons of yummy food around it gets packed!  I will probably sound like an old person but I can still remember when French Quarter Fest was just a few stages and that was about it.  Now it has grown to multiple stages spanning from Woldenberg park to the Mint.  \n\nIn the past when I lived on the Westbank (don't judge) my friends and I would park by the ferry and walk over (back when I was free, geesh I feel old) and that was the easiest way to enjoy the fest!  And now that I live on this side of the river carpooling was my savior.  I went with two girlfriends and a nephew and we parked and arrived relatively early on a Saturday or Sunday (I forget).  We didn't have a specific music itinerary but I was prepared with the food itinerary!  I had a list of all of the food being offered and their locations.  Then I reviewed the list with my fellow friends and we strategized which booths we wanted to hit.  Oh yeah, we take our food seriously! =)\n\nSo this past year we started from Woldenberg park and went only as far as Jackson Square.  The plan was to visit with the official artist who was one of my girlfriend's friend.  Another girlfriend and I ended up buying the official print with Dr. John on it and he personalized the signature which was fun.  It was a great festival and I got to even see my fellow yelper and buddy, Steve I. and his family!\n\nI highly recommend this festival!\n\nHappy Festing y'all!",

Once I was heading there for a poor boy when work called and I had to turn around. Another time I pulled up and saw a line outside the door. The last time I tried they were closed. This time I was lucky and found them open, and not very crowded.\n\nAs Shannon so accurately described the interior, the place is a dive. To me, that is a great thing. Even the men's room is a dive where you have to stand on a wooden pallet to use the urinal. The run down, old look adds to the ambiance and lets you know you're in a neighborhood joint, not some purpose built fancy building.\n\nThe roast beef poor boy comes with creole mustard when you order it \"dressed\". This is different than most other poor boy shops and they made sure to let me know in advance. The poor boy was good, but didn't wow me. It was far superior to some I have tried, but fell short when compared to others. The sandwich used the correct bread (there are giant Leidenheimer bags on the wall when you enter), had a good gravy/meat ratio, but I think the creole mustard may have detracted from the sandwich. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love creole mustard, but I may have found one thing that I don't particularly like it on. Even if I had ordered it without the mustard, I don't think my rating would have changed. It was good, but for my tastes, I've had better.\n\nIn summary, Domilise has a good roast beef poor boy. While not the best I have had, if you're in the neighborhood and want a roast beef, give them a try.",

  "text": "The first thing I like to do, immediately, upon arriving in Philly is order a big, fat, juicy sandwich. Cheesesteak is good but if a roast pork with broccoli rabe is available, then that is going to go in my mouth.\n\nWe drove up to John's Roast Pork 17 minutes too late. They had shut down two customers ahead of us. We drove away hungry and lost. Good 'ol Yelp app led us to Jake's Sandwich Board within minutes. Jake's looked so promising! Four stars and they were awarded a Best of Philly 2012. There were a lot of things on the menu that interested me. Smothered, Cowboy, Barnyard, Village Turkey, just to name a few. On top of that, the place itself was quaint and clean.   \n\nI let Jocy C do the ordering and we got the 50/50 and Italian Pork. The 50/50 sounded tasty because it had bacon and sriracha in it. The Italian Pork we had to get just to compare to the other sandwiches in Philly.\n\nWe took the food to go, arrived at our hotel not even 15 minutes later, and tore into the sandwiches. The 50/50 was dry and bland. Barely a kick of sriracha and the bacon was thin. The Italian Pork did not have enough Provolone or broccoli rabe. If the pork had not been so dry, these toppings would not have been so much of an issue. The sandwiches were barely edible. Yes, you could easily eat it but it wasn't so enjoyable. I saved half of my sandwich for later. Later, I finished it and it was still not good.\n\nI have had old sandwiches from Philly and they were juicy 24 hours later and with the flavors settled in, they were pretty good sandwiches. Jake's kind of failed on every level.\n\nI recently came across an online article on poutine versions in Philly. Jake's Farm Fries (pork gravy and provolone) looked the saddest of the bunch. Literally pale in comparison to the others.\n\nSadly, Jake's food does not make me salivate. I will not come back.\n\nLong live Paesano's and Tommy DiNic's!",

The happy hour is the best time. \n\nIt seems like it's very casual. Just sit on a couch. There's a bar area, but the couches are more comfortable, and there's board games you can play. Good place for local original cocktails. Lots of classic ingredients with a new twist. Came in with the girl one late afternoon. We got a seat on the couch and ordered the Pahranagat Punch. It's $7 at happy hour. This is a mixture of champagne, lemon juice, mint, nutmeg, orange juice, and rye whiskey. It's both sour and sweet. This is easy to knock back, and it will get you fucked up. It's also nice to sip and enjoy the simple yet complex flavor. The other cocktails sound good but this is our favorite of the ones we've already had. \n\nCome here on a full stomach before drinking.

We waited a bit for a table and when we got seated we got the ditziest waiter imaginable. Fortunately there we were still near the bar and near where waiters went in and out so we could catch someone to help refill our glasses etc. as other reviews have stated it. Gets really loud in here. I didn't notice it at the bar but when we we were seated it was tough to hear. \n\nAfter thoroughly reading the Yelp reviews I ordered the goat tacos to share as an appetizer and they were good but kinda small. I ordered the mussels which were good but nothing to write home about. Sadly the best food I tried there was a friend's side of grits, damned they were good! My friends were disappointed in the small portions of food. \n\nSo I would definitely recommend this joint to grab a nice strong drink at the bar and to hang out there. Not so much for the food.\n\nHappy drinking!",

After merging onto I-75 north bound I quickly got up to speed, it was a little before 9:00 PM and traffic was moving a little over 80 mph and all three lanes were still congested from rush hour. This highway is a good example of what I dislike about this side of the state, I guess if I was retired and didn't have to venture out during the morning and even rush hours I may consider moving here being I love the gulf waters over the Atlantic side.\n\nJust as I settled in for the ride I realized I needed to fuel up before crossing the state so I exited once I saw the sign for this station. The exit is not lit and with pouring rain it can be a little difficult to maneuver when exiting at a high rate of speed. The first curve forced me to scrub most of my speed but I had to immediately get back in it to cross the (3) lanes while merging to get all the way left to turn into the station - note to file this seems to be a popular spot for the \"Road Ranger\" (sponsored by State Farm) I'm not sure what the attraction is but I did notice (2) during my short visit maybe \"donuts\"?\n\nI don't know how old this Racetrac is but it's very clean and the fuel prices were competitive.

  "text": "Milk House is one of my go-tos for delivery. They are fast and affordable, even when you consider delivery fees/charges. My usual is the caesar salad with rosemary grilled chicken. It's a huge salad with tons of chicken and it fills me for the entire day. The dressing is delicious and there is always a nice amount of parmesan. \n\nI have occasionally ordered some of the other salads and they are always very fresh and tasty. I did have a botched order once when I ordered the signature salad and it arrived without bacon. How did they forget the bacon?! \n\nI'd love to try the grilled cheese sometime but that would require a planned splurge - they sound amazing and also amazingly fattening! I'm so glad Milk House sees all of its customers and provides quality food for everyone at an affordable price!",

  "text": "Okay, so I'm back for a very long and overdue update. So I learned my lesson, just never expect good food if you're ordering \"American Chinese.\" I've been back here countless times to eat in and for carry out. \n\nTheir traditional dishes are phenomenal. Seriously some of the best Chinese food I've had in St. Louis. I went with a friend who ordered entirely off the menu for us and I was blown away. I wish I could recall what each dish was....\n\nI tried their shrimp Lo Mein last week and it was seriously the best Lo Mein I've ever. had. I couldn't put my finger on what made it so good...I shamefully consumed the entire serving. \n\nWhat truly sets Wei Hong apart is their BBQ and Bakery. I recommend any dish that incorporates their freshly BBQ'd duck or pork. Their crispy pork is as savory and flavorful as you can possibly imagine. Also, don't forget to leave without trying their baked goods. I've pretty much sampled everything but before you leave you need to snag a handful of BBQ pork buns. They'll change your life. They're only $2 each and you can have like 2 for lunch and be full. One of these days I'll have to grab some BBQ to go!",

  "text": "The Bar Louie girls -- the high school group of six -- decided to celebrate our second anniversary of getting together by going back to Bar Louie -- where it all started!\n\nThree of us got there 30 minutes \"early,\" so we speared a lovely rounded booth facing all the TVs. Got water, reviewed the imbibement list and took a little minute to decide.\n\nOur server (We kept calling her Susie, but then explained to her why we called her Susie, and she got a hoot out of it.) was just spot-on with the leisure and flavor of our table! I wish I could remember her name, but she was absolutely delightful and extremely attentive.\n\nTuesday is $1 burger night. Well, you gotta know the $1 burger is lettuce and a bun -- it says so explicitly on the menu. No arguments from us readers!! You want cheese, bacon, mayo, grilled onions, raw onions, tomatoes --  anything else -- it costs extra!! For the most part, additions are 50 cents extra. Mayo is 25 cents extra.\n\nThe dollar burger menu encourages you to order a basket of fries or tots. Ask how much that costs -- 'cause it ain't $1. We asked. And we asked how many that basket would serve.\n\nOK, here's the rundown: one basket of fries or tots costs $4, and it serves 2-3. BINGO! You got the picture.\n\nWe started out with a cone basket of calamari with its lucious ketchup-horseradish sauce. It was wonderful. I wish we'd ordered two.\n\nThen we were on to the burgers. Everybody got exactly what they ordered, brought out by the \"kitchen\"? Not sure, but he was fabulous. And we got a basket of tots.\n\nBy this time our sixth attendee had arrived, and she was giving her burger order to the kitchen guy. He was taking it all in, but then Susie was there, so she took over. Great service!!\n\nAnd we ordered another basket of tots. There's just something about tots that reminds me of childhood. And, yes, tater tots were already invented when I was a child. (So was fire.)\n\nThe burgers just hit the spot! Great buns, a good-sized patty with nice beef flavor and a reasonable amount of lettuce. Add a little ketchup and a lot of mustard (both free), dig into the tots, and you gotta a great meal! I added Cheddar to my burger, so it was a $1.50 burger. There were four cheese options: Cheddar, Pepper Jack, American and Provel (I think).\n\nThat second basket of tots was HOT-HOT -- fresh out of the tot-maker!! Yum!! The six of us did not finish that second basket.\n\nA fabulous evening with good friends, good food, good service!",

  "text": "Every time I come here and walk through the front door, I ask the hostess, \"You still have the all-you-can-eat, right?\"  They look at me like I'm crazy, maybe because I am.  But I have to ask because this place is such a steal, that I thought they would stop serving AUCE by now.  Seriously, when I throw down here, just me one person--- I probably eat at least $150 worth of food at a regular Tampa Bay sushi restaurant for $25.\n\nAll-you-can-eat sushi places seem to get a bad rap these days.  However, Umami Sushi is fantastic.  I have never had a mad meal here.  To me, they have some of the best items, if you know what to order.  There was a point when I was here almost once a week for a while, let's not go back to those days.  However, once you discover a restaurant that is such a good deal, what are you waiting for?\n\nI have tried everything on the AUCE lunch and dinner menu, and I mean everything.  These are the items that I recommend:\n- Hand Rolls:  These are rice balls loaded with toppings--- similar to trendy onigiri, but in the shape of a cone.  My favorite here is the Eel and Avocado.  The seaweed is crispy and the rice is warm, it is very filling but so good.  These are by far my favorite.\n- Octopus salad, wakame, and ginger salad-  I actually like to order these three salads and mix them.  My favorite of the three is the octopus salad.\n- Nigiri - this is fish or toppings on top of a small oval of rice.  Again, my favorites are the Eel and the Tuna.  Avoid the escolar (read about escolar online to learn more about this fish).\n- Rolls - most of the rolls here are decent.  If you do not see a combination that you like, ask your server for a custom roll.  As long as they have the ingredients then they will make the rolls for you.\n- Lots of sauces-  the sauces here are endless, but you will need to ask for them.  This also includes your ginger and wasabi.  Just ask.  Also, spicy mayo and eel sauces are available as well as new sauces that they are creating often.  \n- Vegetable Yaki Udon-  This is a nice break for those that like noodles and need some vegetables between more meat and carbs.  This is on the back side of the menu with the cooked foods.\n\nThe only items I avoid here are the fried desserts, they are just not appealing to me.  The ice creams are just ok if you are looking for a sweet snack at the end.\n\nAlso, make sure to look at the back of the menu at the cooked items and try a few things.  Note that the cooked items are much more filling.  As other reviewers have noted, the food here comes out fast, and the servers are sad if you don't eat enough.  So bring your appetite.\n\nNote that they added a lower lunch price for AUCE on weekdays and Saturdays.  However, Sunday is always dinner AUCE price.  Umami also has a regular menu, if you would like to order off of the regular menu for regular pricing.",

This makes no sense to me...at least this place was open and cooking until 11pm.\n\nI had the french onion soup and also ordered the Hot Buffalo Chicken Salad.  It was really good.  In fact, I had it two days in a row.\n\nThis place has some amazing beer specials too.  Sunday had $2.75 Linny's on Tap...I can not even find it that cheap in Wisconsin and they brew it there. Monday had two dollar off craft beers...they also had a nice selection of craft brews too...I liked a beer called Exit 11.  Tuesday had 3 dollar beer bottles but I had to go back to the craft brews...the bar has a nice list behind the counter that has price, ounces and alcohol content.  Wednesday was 2 dollar Dos Equis...I wish I was there right now but I need to go to bed and get ready for my flight home.\n\nThe bartender (I think her name was Rose) was really good.  She remembered me...which is always a postive when it comes to customer service.  She also tried to talk to every patron and knew many of them by there first names...you really do not see that in a bartender!\n\nTwo nice big bars, plenty of tables and enough big screens to watch the game...it was fun to watch Philly fans root for there team!!!",

  "text": "For my 1100th review, I review the iconic Muriel's Jackson Square, one of the loveliest restaurant/event spaces in New Orleans. I first attended a wedding here on Halloween 2010. My two fabulous friends pulled out all the stops and had an amazing horror movie-themed wedding where Jason and Leatherface got things started with a bang (er, a chainsaw). Sure seems like the folks behind Muriels worked well with my friends and the wedding was an occasion to remember. We were upstairs, where private events are held, and took breaks from the main room in the bordello-like seance room. One of my favorite things about this night included hanging out with cocktails on huge balcony overlooking Jackson Square. \n\nBy the way, if you're dining here and there isn't an event going on, you're free to go upstairs and check all that out. You can even have a drink and bring it up to the Seance Room (and I strongly recommend that you do, if you like rooms dripping in red, chandeliers, velvet and brocade. It makes me want to decorate my entire apartment in a similar fashion). \n\nRecently I came to realize that besides the gorgeous environs, the restaurant serves up some really great food and drink. My friends and I had lunch here recently. We were seated in the room where they open the huge glass doors to the sidewalk so you can watch passersby and listen to music being played out in Jackson Square. \n\nAt lunchtime, they offer $4 Bloody Marys, wines and martinis. I indulged in a Bloody Mary, as I am often wont to do, and found it to be quite satisfactory (garnished with olives, pickled green beans and citrus and served in a pint glass. No skimping here just cuz it's a mere 4 bucks). \n\nI ordered the modestly-named Vegetable Plate. I'll be honest and say I wasn't expecting much because I've had many a pedestrian veg plate where they barely even marinate the vegetables before skewering them and grilling. Booooring. \n\nI'm thrilled to report that Muriel's Vegetable Plate belongs in the Vegetable Plate Hall of Fame. First of all, it contains braised kale. Almost 'nuff said there, but I'll go on to say its flavor is just so so so very good. The other star of the plate is that compact square of polenta flavored with herbs and Parm cheese. Everything is so delicately placed, which I love, and nothing overwhelmed with oils or heavy sauces to \"make up for\" the fact that you're eating a plate of vegetables. There's a delightful little bit of everything from beets to parsnips to tender shittake mushrooms. A healthy, hearty plate. Thank you, Muriels! I seriously could not stop thinking about it all day.\n\nThey also have a gluten-free menu.\n\nI think I'll be dining here on the regular when I have visitors in town. It's just the perfect place to take them when they want the quintessential French Quarter dining experience.",

  "text": "So if you really like seafood and are visiting this area of Florida, Crabby Bill's is a pretty fun place to stop. Be warned, during peak times and peak tourist season, it gets really crowded, and parking IS an issue. We visited during a peak time and for lunch and wound up waiting about 45 minutes, which was not horrendous but still. When we left around 2:30, there was no wait. So coming during a non-peak time could really pay off.\n\nA note on the parking: The parking around this restaurant sucks. But there's a trick to it. The host stand will sell you a parking pass for the whopping sum of $1. The permit is good for like an hour and a half or something like that. You put it on the dash in your car and then can park anywhere in the lot right in front of the restaurant where there's a meter. Makes it WAY easier. Best thing to do is have your driver drop off a passenger to run in and get a pass and then troll the lot for a spot.\n\nSo once we were seated we had a great time. Our waitress was great. The cocktails were great and beachy (and tasty). We had crab cakes (good), crab legs (everything you want) and I had the lobster roll, which was fabulous. Fries were perfect, sides were good. A+ for the food. Going for lunch, it was actually pretty reasonable. I think it was something like $140 for the five of us. We would definitely go back, even though it's a touch on the touristy side. That was OK given how we were being all touristy and stuff at the time.",

We'd just finished up a movie at the Riverside theater and I popped over here to get something warm and filling.  For $11, I got the chicken and mushroom pot pie which was just the perfect size (not too big, not too small) AND a very generously sized salad that came with Gorgonzola cheese, walnuts and sliced apples.  The decor was simple but inviting. Loved the music - a little bit of Michael Franti, a little bit of Bob Marley, a little of the Nappy Roots (hey, give me credit that I even KNOW who the Nappy Roots are).\n\nThe only downside was the service, which is provided by kids who are coming out of the foster care system.  After waiting for at least 10 minutes, no one came by to bring water or take an order.  Finally got up and went to the  cash register. No one there. Peeked my head into the kitchen and finally got someone's attention.  So perhaps a bit more training and a suggestion to be a bit friendlier and warmer to customers might be helpful.  Maybe the kid was just shy and new.\n\nPRO TIP #1:  Only saw the sign as I was walking out, but if you like them on Facebook, you get a free beverage.\n\nPRO TIP #2:  Parking on the street is free on Sundays.\n\nPRO TIP #3: Validated parking in the garage on First St. by Silver Peak. \n\nPRO TIP #4: They sell their Pies Take and Bake for those nights when you just need a little comfort!",

  "text": "My only regret going to Edmonton is that I didn't see any cows. However, that didn't stop me from eating some, and DOSC was the best introduction to the Albertan beef culinary scene I could've hoped for. \n\nLocated right in downtown Edmonton, DOSC has got that classy but unpretentious vibe that I really dig. Beautiful open space with rustic furniture, wood beam ceilings, slightly steampunk feels. I love it. Fantastic place to grab a craft cocktail or a great steak, which is exactly what I did. \n\nVisiting from Toronto, I cannot get over how much steak I can get for my money. A beautiful 10 oz dry-aged ribeye for $42...that's better value than the Keg! And obviously so much tastier. The juicy steak was perfectly medium rare, sitting on a fluffy cushion of garlicky pomme puree. Also go the Oxtail Poutine which was great with fresh fries and savoury oxtail meat but the real star of the show was the Brussel Sprouts. The large size was big enough to share between 4 and the sprouts were perfectly crispy, a little citrusy and a little sweet. We added pancetta to it and it was absolute perfection. Great recommendation from our server, who was also superb! \n\nIf you're looking for a great place for a date, or just craving some good meat, DOSC is the place to go!",

  "text": "I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap.\n\nFirst flaw is that the chicken on a buffalo chicken wrap out to be chicken tenders. Hands down choice. The thinly chopped mess they put on this one seemed slimy enough to have come from the pizza toppings from the night before. The tortilla was soft and chewy. No issues there. \n\nThe balance of the flavors was off. Hot sauce dominated everything, there was not enough blue cheese to balance the hot sauce.\n\nThe redeeming factor for me were the fries. The fries were cripsy, just oily enough, and soft fluffy inside. These were fresh out of the fryer.",

  "text": "I came to this brunch spot in Philly, with a friend I met in Honduras! We came in on a Saturday afternoon and it was definitely crowded, but it was expected! All the hungover frat party people filled up this place, with some families and older people. I liked the fact that this is a house converted into a restaurant, so it felt really very homey. I am definitely a fan of places that don't overhype and make it feel like you are just sitting at home eating a fabulous breakfast!\n\nWe got seated on the bar area looking out onto the street, which is always conducive to people watching (my favorite past time). We got the black coffee, which was fresh! And for brunch, I got the pumpkin chocolate chip & peanut butter pancakes - topped with strawberries, blueberries, whipped cream, little balls of peanut butter, chocolate chips, apple sauce, and peanut butter in between my stack of 4 extra large pancakes. I know what you are thinking - heart attack waiting to happen! It was absolutely delicious though, but way too much for one person to finish! It had a good balance between sweetness of the pancakes (& toppings) and the fresh fruit! I only ended up finishing half of it, but the pumpkin pancakes had a good consistency. \n\nOverall, good food, awesome ambiance, and great service! Be sure to make a reservation before paying a visit here!",

  "text": "All of the stuff that I wrote below is true and I had given the place four stars for the price point of the hotel. But then I had to change it to one star after I saw this mother****ing roach on the wall by the kitchen this morning! Yuck!\n\nWhen I entered TownePlace Suites by Marriott in North Tampa,  I was happy to see how clean and modern the cute little Lobby was. The receptionist at the desk was really friendly. She checked me in quickly. Luckily I was staying in the main building.  On the way to the elevator, I noticed the fitness room. It's very tiny but if you want a basic workout with weights, it'll do the job. When I walked into the elevator to take it up to the second floor, there were crumbs and debris on the floor. I thought to myself \"Oh, boy!\" My concerns were abaited when I entered the room. All the rooms here are suites with a small kitchenette, a couch and chair, ample desk, nice 5 closet, and a modern bathroom.  The first thing I do is check for signs for bed bugs. I was happy to see that they put a bed bug liner on the mattress and there were no signs of any bed bugs.  The room was clean.  There were some flaws. I noticed chipped, peeling paint on the baseboards and walls. But again, the room was clean. \n\nThe hotel is centrally located in North Tampa about a mile from I-75. The hotel is close to a lot of the attractions in North Tampa including the  Museum of Science and Industry (4 miles) and Busch Gardens (5 miles). It's all so close to the Premium Outlets.  The Check-in time is 4:00 PM and Check-out time is 12:00 PM.\n\nAmenities include an outside pool, free Wi-Fi, free parking, and free breakfast served from 7 to 10 a.m.",

The decor is not really my style either. But I have two words for you: TUNA DUMPLING. I would seriously walk to New Jersey to order the TUNA DUMPLING.\n\nUh, so best thing to do is look at my picture, but it's basically a faux dumpling that looks like a soup dumpling but instead of a dumpling skin, the outside of the dumpling is made out of tuna. The inside is a combo of creamy crab and something crunchy... panko maybe, I don't know. It is served on a plate with two sauces -- a sweet hoisin type sauce and a creamy wasabi sauce. Combined with the tuna and crab it is deeelicious. It's something I truly crave. Like I seriously could just come here and eat two of these and call it a day.\n\nOtherwise, we generally like the sushi. Loved the Halloween roll this last time. The Cha Cha Roll was OK, my hubby really liked it. Also like the New York handroll, with slices of green apple. Sunday and Monday sushi is 30% off. TUNA DUMPLING.",

All the jewelry and purses that girls love and the make up and all that good stuff, it's there.  Lastly, all that stuff that you buy at the touristy places, souvenirs, etc, yep all here.\n\nI am excited to have gone here. I feel like it's one of the biggest flea markets with everything in it, not just the same ol stuff at each stand. My favorite was the tiki guy who makes tiki bars. They have so much detail, of course they cost and arm and a leg, and I don't know if people actually spend an arm, leg, and whatever at a flea market, but hey it was really cool!\n\nCheck it out! I think it's good for one of those rainy days when you want to do something but don't want to stay home.

Because it successfully helped with me severe case of missing-Hawaii-itis.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nAfter getting married in Hawaii a month prior to this writing, we've been visiting every Hawaiian restaurant that we can find in Tampa Bay. The Honu is definitely one of my favorites so far! I ordered the Manu Kea & Keck I & II, which is a long way of saying beef, spinach and rice. The beef had a phenomenal flavor to it, and despite its basic nature, I really loved it and could eat it every day.\n\nFor dessert we shared a couple of things: the macademia nut ice cream and this cookie crumble thing that was served inside a glass. I was really glad we ordered these two things together because they complimented each other nicely. If I had to pick a favorite, I'd have to go with the ice cream.\n\nAs for the vibe of the Honu, they definitely did a great job of making you feel like you're actually in Hawaii. If only we could add some mountains in Dunedin, we'd be all set. We sat outside with our dog, and they even brought him a meal of chicken and sweet potatoes for $3. If Moose could type, I'm certain he'd be offering a 5-star review as well.",

  "text": "Why 5 stars? Because I'd be a regular if I lived nearby.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nIf you live Downtown, Duckweed is probably your favorite place in the world, by default. Going to the grocery store is probably not very convenient for downtown dwellers, so I'd imagine people that live in places like the Edge, find Duckweed to be an essential part of their life. But the great thing about Duckweed is that not only can you find some of your grocery essentials here, but they are also a specialty food store. It's quite impressive when you consider the size of the place, how many amazing things are packed in here.\n\nThe beer selection is superb - not only bottles, but also taps for growler refills. Other taps include Mother Kombucha and Commune Co coffee. Speaking of alcohol, you can pick up a bottle of wine (or 3) here. There's a sweets counter with fudge, cupcakes, chocolates, etc. There's a deli with hot and cold subs, and a bunch of side dishes that you can pack up and heat up later. I'd imagine quite a few people living downtown aren't exactly the \"dinner-cooking\" types, and probably survive at this counter.\n\nI feel like the above was a script for an infomercial. That's not what I intended, but I'd definitely be their spokesperson if they asked. Long live Duckweed!",

  "text": "I purposely avoided joining City Fitness prior to their opening and immediately after because I knew there would likely be some hurdles to overcome. Judging by the early reviews, I was right in my decision. But now that they are in their third month, things seem to be flowing smoothly. I've been a member for two weeks now and I'm very happy with my decision to make the switch from my old gym to this one. \n\nFor starters, the facility is brand new. That means everything is clean, machines are new, nice locker rooms, etc. The two-story layout is interesting and the hallway downstairs is a little tight but after a few trips to the locker rooms after using the back staircase, I feel like I know where everything is located. \n\nEveryone on the staff is super friendly. That's important. You don't want to join a gym and feel awkward. I've been greeted with friendly hellos or goodbyes every time I've gone so far. The towel service is great, and there are always plenty of fluffy hand towels available.  \n\nI purchased the highest tier membership, which includes all classes and access to the We Fit classes. This membership was only five dollars more than my previous gym, and now I'm getting access to the circuit training classes I used to seek outside of my old gym (an extra expense I'll no longer have to worry about). I took advantage of my free personal training session and liked it enough that I have signed up to train with David once a week. Since I'm currently training for Broad Street, I'll probably stick to the treadmills and my PT for the next couple months, but I look forward to trying the classes and We Fit after the run. \n\nBottom line, I'm really happy City Fitness finally made it to the neighborhood!",

  "text": "I've been in St. Louis for the last eight years, but this was my first time up in the Arch. We had family in town and therefore an excuse to be a tourist in our own city! But we decided to do this kinda last minute. Apparently, if you decide in advance, you can not only buy your tickets online, but you can also schedule your time and date. We arrived around 3:15p on a Saturday in June and the earliest available time was 4:35p. We killed time exploring the couple rooms in the old building that had some great historical information.....and then we went to Starbucks across the street.\n\nWe were allowed to enter at 4p, so we headed over and went through security around 4:15p. We probably didn't get on the elevator to ride up until around 5:20p. The time in between was spent standing in one line, then standing in another, then receiving a number, then having our picture taken, then standing in another line, then standing in ANOTHER line and then standing and waiting outside of our assigned elevator. And these elevators are pretty darn small, as you might imagine. For any of you who might be worried about feeling claustrophobic, there is an elevator on display next to where you by your tickets. You can even step inside and see how you feel. Make sure you do that before hand if you have any concerns.\n\nThe ride is 4 minutes. Our ride was pretty smooth. The only problem I had was that the elevator door is clear, so you can see the insides of the structure falling down behind you, which made me dizzy to watch. My husband, on the other hand, said it made him feel better. \n\nOnce you get up to the top, it's pretty darn tiny - go figure. But you can get some pretty neat photos!\n\nOne of my fears was that I'd be able to feel the Arch swaying (as many people told me you could). But unless I was standing and leaning against a wall, I really didn't feel it. \n\nThe ride back down was 3 minutes and for some reason it was a little bumpy and clanky....I can't say that was very encouraging. \n\nOver all, this was a fun excursion because I was with my family and having a great time. I had no idea that getting up to the top would be the huge process that it was. But I'm really glad that we did it together!",

The concept is very similar to Agno in that you can build your own bowl, only the flavors are Asian as opposed to Mediterranean. \n\nI went with the jasmine rice with scallions as my base, ginger beef for my protein, pickled red onion, shredded carrots and snap peas for my toppings, and peanut Thai basil sauce. I also added a lemon ginger turmeric water in hopes that some vitamins and minerals will help cure me of the never-ending seasonal cold I've been suffering.\n\nI was very impressed and happy with the bowl and the flavors of all the ingredients. Often when I deviate from the house suggestions to 'create my own' I do a disastrous job of choosing items that taste delicious when put together.

The food was okay - not mind blowing, not bad, okay.  Neither of my kids like the beans which is weird because that's usually they're favourite. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday... but no Taco Tuesday specials in sight.  The special of the day was mojitos and I most definitely enjoyed a cold one of those made with love.\n\nOur server was friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nthe kiddo special (quesadilla) was a hit with mom and dad but not the kids.  My kids must be broken. \n\nOverall, we left satisfied but not really wanting to come back for the food.  As mentioned by other reviewers the decor is awesome and the ambience perfect.  Unfortunately, the food just didn't hit the spot with any of us.  \n\nIf you're looking for authentic delicious fresh Mexican, I'd highly recommend Calle Mexico on the North Side just a hop and a skip out of downtown.",

However those who ordered the pasta dishes stated that they were delicious (cajun pasta & lobster & shrimp mac n' cheese) & will order it again. For dessert we all had the triple chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream & we all loved it. \n\nThanks Gordon Biersch for making this a memorable event for my brother, new sister-in-law, & family.

There's always complementary cakes, tea, coffee around.  Most drinks are very reasonably priced from a few dollars.\n\nThe innkeepers are very nice and go out of their way to help you with your travel plans.  The service here is great. \n\nThe surrounding area is a residential neighborhood that's pretty low key, relaxing, and has a lot of cool houses.  It's close to St Charles Street, which is great for walks.  There is also a good number of cafes and restaurants within a mile of so.  I did not expect this, but was pleasantly surprised.\n\nIt isn't close to the French quarter, but it's close to the tram stops on St Charles Street, which should take approx 15-20 mins to get there, or around $10 in cab fare.  Parking is also plentiful in the area.\n\nOnly thing I didn't care for was the thermostat in common areas.  We arrived during late December, and other guests often turned up the heater very high.  This made it difficult for us to sleep at times, or woke us up in the middle of the night in uncomfortable 90 degree heat.  \n\nAlso, the rooms can be a bit thin.  We had Darth Vader in the room next to us when we stayed, and he kept us up with some extraordinarily heavy breathing.\n\nPrices are very reasonable for what you get.\n\nRecommended.",

  "text": "This was another find due to LivingSocial. I'm positive that I would not have known about this place otherwise. \"Local\" and \"friendly\" were two words that immediately came to mind when I walked in. I ordered a two sandwiches and a side of red potato salad... and no I didn't eat all of it one sitting.\n\nThe Hot Chicken and Cheese sandwich was loaded with chicken strips, mushrooms, onions, melted provolone cheese. In my opinion, the bread is what elevates the sandwich from good to great. The bread was wonderfully soft, lightly toasted and held everything perfectly. Nothing particularly unique about this sandwich, but there's nothing wrong with simple in this case.\n\n\"Ronnie's Pastrami Special\" was definitely special. It was unlike any pastrami sandwich I've ever had. This triple decker sandwich was layered  with thinly sliced hot pastrami, hot corned beef, Swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato on rye. It was awesome. Everything worked together harmoniously.\n\nOverall, the sandwiches are great and the service was really friendly. I would definitely return for the pastrami sandwich, but the red potato salad didn't really strike a chord with me and could have done without it.",

I came here a few years ago to pick blueberries, and now is the perfect time for strawberries. \n\nIt was super easy. No registration or check in. I just saw on their FB that there was picking today and tomorrow. Keep checking there depending on what is still available.\n\nMake sure to use the Starkey blvd. Because GPS will tell you to take another street. I'd suggest putting Starkey Market in GPS. It's down the street so make sure to keep your eyes peeled out for the Starkey blueberry farm sign. It's across the street from a small plaza that has Havana Dreamers Cafe.\n\nThey tell you to wash your hands and you will get a bag. As soon as you go in the field, you will see the low plants which are strawberries. The high bushes are blueberries.\n\nThese are such good strawberries, so mouth watering good!!  When you walk the path of strawberries and see bright red, you might feel like it's a jack pot lol. I did.\n\nIf I saw a bunch of red strawberries in other aisles I would walk over the aisles to get them because walking around was too much lol.\n\nSo happy to have gone strawberry picking today. Now off to make all things strawberry.\n\nToday, January 4, 2021, the strawberries were $4/pound.",

  "text": "We stayed two nights in this hotel in January for our first trip to the New Orleans French Quarter. After some careful research, we decided that this was the best hotel, in the most convenient location for the money. In hind sight, it would have been good to pay a little more and stay at a newer place. \n\nThe Hotel Monteleone has classic charm. It has an aura of antiquated fancy, but not modern expensive. The doormen were always charming and quick with directions. Checking in and out was quick and easy. In fact, when we checked out, they let us pay a small fee to keep our bags in a secured room until it was time for our flight. That was great! \n\nOur first room was a few floors above the front door and we could easily hear the noise from the street in our room. Sensing sleepless nights, we quickly requested to change rooms. An employee was run up to us with new keys and escorted us to our new room. The new room was not as good as the first and we could hear noisy neighbors on either side of us. I begged M not to make us change rooms again - afterall, how could we predict noisy neighbors? \n\nM's general opinion was that it would be best to pay just a little more money to stay in a hotel that had a few more luxuries (e.g. newspapers delivered to our room) and sound-proof walls. She's a staunch hotel snob and also needs absolute silence to sleep. Also, after spending the weekend in the midst of the French Quarter, we'd both prefer to stay at a nicer hotel just outside of the neighborhood off of Poydras Street and walk the short distance to touristy activities.",

  "text": "Sometimes you're staying in an Airbnb in New Orleans that's a little less comfortable than you'd like (read: a broken water heater and a bachelorette party next door). Sometimes you find yourself craving the sweet, sweet predicability of a good hotel room (read: temperature control of the air and water sort, housekeeping, etc etc). Sometimes you book yourself that good hotel room and fall into a state of vacation bliss (read: Ace Hotel New Orleans). \n\nI've been to the Ace in Los Angeles and Palm Springs, but only as a lady who drinks next to the pool and never as an actual hotel guest. I love each Aces I've been to and how they're designed with regional decor. The NOLA location features many nods to the city itself, with lots of lush plants, a classy Southern bar, and cool antique glass bottles. The staff here is incredibly friendly--hey were flexible with us and offered late check out, plus watched our bags for a bit after we checked out and explored the neighborhood. \n\nThe rooms themselves are truly wonderful--comfy, stylish, and equipped with anything you might need. I absolutely loved the SMEG refrigerator and amazing assortment of snacks and drinks. While I don't usually indulge in the minibar, having my favorite wine + Zapp's chips within arms distance was too much to pass up. Make sure to try on the comfy bathrobes--you'll never want to take it off. \n\nMake sure to grab a drink or bite in their restaurant, Josephine Estelle (awesome cocktail list) or lobby bar. The rooftop pool is a must stop--grab your aforementioned bathrobe and head upstairs for a dip and a drink. There's a beautiful Stumptown coffee shop attached to the lobby for your morning caffeine fix (their almond milk latte was fabulous), plus lots of awesome restaurants in the area (we loved Willa Jean for brunch at Seaworthy for dinner). If you're in the mood for shopping, check out Freda, Friend, and Defend New Orleans, three awesome shops on Ace's block. \n\nWhether you're a hotel snob or just looking for a rad place to crash, Ace Hotel New Orleans is THE place to do it. We will absolutely be back soon!",

I was pretty happy that Latitude 29 opened in the Bienville - I like having options and while I like Tiki Tolteca (practically next door) a lot, I dig Latitude 29 in a whole different way.\n\nFirst of all - the tiki drink recipes are classic and meticulously researched by Beachbum Berry, who is probably one of the world's experts in tiki drinks. (No kidding.) This means that these cocktails are strong, have amazing ingredients and taste even more amazing.\n\nSecond, the food menu has something for everyone. The apps price point is perfect ($5-11) and the options are great for someone wanting a small nosh with your cocktail. I love the pineapple bread and the dumpling burger. For the mains, the loco moco is a great option, as is the burger or the steak frites.\n\nSpeaking of the steak frites - it is only $15 during happy hour! What a deal! (There's also drink specials and I am partial to the Odin's punch.)\n\nThe bartenders here are pretty cool - not snooty and actually pay attention to you at the bar.

I'm not sure what they were expecting when they started turning out some of the best Italian food in Philly, but every time we go they seem baffled and overwhelmed by the crowds it draws. There's no real system for waiting for a table, and a Karen had a real meltdown when someone off the street swooped in and sat at the table she was waiting for. While it's always hilarious to see a Karen doing what they do, I can understand the frustration. The overworked and barely interested bartenders shouldn't have to keep track of the tables as well, and they aren't very good at it anyway. \nTable service didn't get much better. The one little miserable waitress they had wasn't sufficient for the crowd. Our appetizer came out way after our meals, and the wait between drinks was inordinate. A bitch didn't even stay for dessert, so you know it was bad!\nAlso. Murph's is lacking in continuity. Some days they are only takeout, other days (yesterday) they aren't doing takeout. Some days is reservation only. Other days no reservations. Great food isn't enough, there needs to be follow through with decent service and systems in place. Until then, or until they do takeout again whichever comes first, I can't see myself enduring that anxiety inducing experience again.",

  "text": "Middle-of-the-road Americana food stuffs at decent prices.  Decent because it's still about $10-$12 a head, which is comparable to places like Outback, Carrabba's and Long Horn.  So which do you prefer for the price?  Bar food with a twist or a middle class sit down at a quite restaurant?  Pick your poison.  If you like NASCAR décor and don't mind eating at a place named after motor oil, then this is the place for you.\n\nWhat I will say is that the wings are big, fat, juicy and crispy as mofo.  Not the cheapest wings around, but they come in a variety of flavors and Scoville scale units (hotness).  My favorite is the Thaiasian, which is a combo of their Thai and Asian named sauces.  I know, Thai is Asian, so the redundancy is strong, but I didn't name these sauces, so relax.  The Bleu cheese servings are small, so ask for two.\n\nAlso good are the Boom Boom Shrimps.  They're pretty big, and the sauce is like your standard \"Bang Bang\" sauce, but with a heavier kick.\n\nService at the bar in the Thunder room is great, and the thick padded seats are designed for max comfort and a long sit.  \n\nAs for beers, they have all the standard domestic and selections with a few imports.  Nothing spectacular.  Go to the Oldsmar Tap House or WoB if you want options.\n\nBack in 2005, my pops decided it would be a good idea to order some Atomic wings, and after one bite, I decided that hot food challenges weren't for me.  But the other night, we watched the 2 guys next to us tackle the Triple Atomic wings, and he ate them effortlessly.  Thee said that they have a better flavor than the regular Atomic wings, making them more edible for the challenge.  So if you're looking to get your name on the \"Wall of Flame,\" go with the Triple Atomic instead of the regular.  2 of 2 morons who prefer to eat extremely hot items to prove their manhood agree.\n\nMy chica had a salmon salad.  I had a bite, and it was pretty good.  Not my thing though.",

First of all, it's local with lots of character (all the bicycle stuff). The flavors reflect the area (like the Home Means Nevada flavor). They sell sandwiches also so you could have a delicious lunch with dessert. Lastly, the service is great with smiling employees. I tried the Cookie Roulette (I liked/recommend) and Matcha Kit Kat (was alright, don't really recommend). Next time I'll get some other delicious flavor. One thing I think they could possibly improve on is the texture of the ice cream--it's pretty icy and not as creamy as I'd prefer. However, this might be what they're going for with less cream so \"more healthy.\" I'd still come back for more even if they're laying off the heavy cream!\n\nI might venture to say that this is best ice cream place in northern Nevada!

  "text": "The very kind people at Francoluigi's served me my very first cheesesteak ever.  Yes, it's true!  I waited til I was in Philly to try the classic meaty sammich.  \n\nThis place came highly recommended by someone who grew up eating here & loving it.  After hearing his stories about the amazing cheesesteaks and how nobody else comes close, and that there's live piano music, and a family-run atmosphere, we beelined over for dinner on a Saturday night.\n\nThough parking in the area can be a real biatch, we found a spot a block away.  I considered that a very good sign!  We walked in, and saw pizzas in the glass case, waiting to be doled out in slices, and a couple of booth seating tables.  We heard live music going on a moment before we saw the famed piano just beyond the glass door.  A split second before we could reach the door, we were greeted and asked if we had reservations.  Even though we did not, we were immediately brought in and seated at a 2-top up the stairs, which gave us a nice view of the tables below, as well as the piano.\n\nA bit of confusion hit us when we looked at the menu and saw not one single sammich - cheesesteak or otherwise.  There was a cheesesteak pizza, but this was not what we came for.  So we asked, and found out that sammiches are only served at the booths that we saw when we walked in, in the more casual seating area by the entrance.\n\nThat was a bit disappointing, but because that was what we were there for, we headed out to be re-seated there, and ordered off a totally different menu with many sammiches and pizzas and more casual food.\n\nService the entire time was very warm, and the cheesesteak came out fast.\n\nNow mind you, I've had a couple other cheesesteaks since that - my very first - one, so I'm writing this with some amount of comparison in my mind.\n\nThe sammich was not as loaded with meat as I expected, and compared to others that followed, was definitely not the norm.  The meat was good quality, and the onions on top were flavorful, along with the provolone.  I tend to be very salt sensitive, so a more bland taste doesn't usually faze me, but now looking back, this was not the best flavored of the few that I had while in town.  I did like that the onions that came on top were more caramelized than other sammiches I tried after - it gave another yummy layer of flavor to this sammich that others didn't have.  But compared to others, the bread sadly wasn't soaked with juices at all, and again, the meat portions were much smaller too.\n\nAs far as Italian restaurants go however, I have a feeling that we didn't really get to see (taste) their best side here.  While we ate, many people came in and out to pick up to-go orders, and they clearly were regulars, so there's obviously something going on here that's worthwhile.  Most people got pizzas, but there were pastas and other things that went by too.\n\nBecause of the very warm service, and the clear support of locals, as well as the glowing recommendation that brought us here in the first place, I'd definitely come back to try other menu items.  But as far as cheesesteak choices go, I doubt I'd come back here for that.",

I was going to catch the trolley, but meh...decided to walk the entire way, which was 15 minutes. Near many of the hotels, this place has great location! Great southern charm with wood foundations and white linens...a bar is tucked away on the side as well to indulge in a few concoctions, mine being a simple mimosa to cheer on my Sunday indulgence. I wanted a traditional nawlins dish that was a little on the heavy side just because it was early! and why the heck not?! It New Orleans! I had perused the menu earlier and saw that this placed served shrimp n grits--my fav so I ventured out just to savor this dish. OMG!!! Great dish minus the eggs on top.I did try to let the dish remain as prepared, but when the eggs started running, I had to remove em! The texture of the white eggs were excellent-- not too hard and seasoned quite well, but it was the Shrimp nGrits that stole my heart! The first bite will leave you speechless! I had to savor that first bite for sure and just take it all in! I leave it there- I cant describe it enough to even make you comprehend tbe excellence at the Luke. Service was also excellent as well whereas the waiter checked on me frequenty and made me feel at home but not to pushy. Im glad I came early Sunday morning and not only had no wait but excellent service and food. I'm leaving Nawlins nice and full folks--its only right!",

Upon arrival, you'll discover a few different things: (1) You've just taken the train to hipster town, welcome. (2) Everyone else in Indy has discovered the awesomeness that is the brunch at Milktooth, prepare for a wait. (3) Bring your brunch pants, because you're about to eat some delicious food\n\nI've had the burger and more recently The Original Dutch Baby Pancake (choice of ham or shiitake, swiss, cranberry mustard, grape, greens, dijon vinaigrette, black pepper). Everything I've had on the menu has been nothing short of delicious.  While you're waiting on table, the baristas are happy to make you your favorite coffee beverage so you can fuel up on caffeine while you plot your brunch adventure.",

  "text": "I love this Dunkin because they know how to make a caramel iced coffee taste good. I think its because of their technique of shaking the drink to mix up the caramel.  The place loses a star because I saw that the employee used the same hand he grabbed my credit card with (he had a plastic glove on this hand) to close the straw hole opening to shake my drink up.  The plastic glove basically defeats its purpose if he's going to use that hand to touch everything. I'm not sure if that would pass a sanitation inspection....",

Instead of a sandwich you get basically a bagel split open with each half host to an unmanageable amount of tuna with some cheese on top of it. I basically scraped 60% of the tuna salad off to get the ratio to a reasonable state. Make it a closed face sandwich, make it in a press or something?",

  "text": "Creativity comes to me in a lot of ways, but most often it's from something I observe in my environment. So when I'm in need of a little inspiration I sometimes cruise the aisles of a craft store! I know, it sounds strange, but staring at felt stencils, paint colors, and styrofoam shapes can sometimes spark and idea or two, or three. They're always DIY craft projects, but that can be fun, or fun for the people I get to help me with them! \n\nMost recently I discovered kinetic sand, which carries the tagline \"One touch will blow your mind!\". Trust me, it will! This stuff only sticks to itself, never dries out, and has all the fun qualities of sand but none of the mess! Check out this video and prepare to be amazed! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_-zqsgDA4 \n\nMichael's has just about everything you could want in a craft store experience. Friendly helpful staff, a big selection of products, and for me, creative inspiration galore. I'm determined to find a way to use kinetic sand soon!",

Carolyn,  my server at the bar, was really sweet and accommodating. Because the cafe is in the history center, they can't do a lot of the grilled meats that are cooked over open fires. So a lot of the original food has to be had at the Columbia Restaurant in Ybor. I had a Cuban sandwich with plantain chips with a dill pickle wedge and a fresh sliced tomato. It was Meh..okay I guess. It wasn't the worst Cuban sandwich I've had but it wasn't close to the best. The service was a bit slow. There is indoor and outdoor seating. You can't beat the view of the Hillsborough River! Convenient if you're going to the Tampa History Center and a good location if you are on Riverwalk.",

  "text": "After reading Shercole's glowing review, I bookmarked this spot and made immediate plans to have lunch here.\n\nI stopped in here on a late Sunday afternoon after doing some Metairie shopping. There was really no one here, but I was greeted with a smile and told that I could sit anywhere. Looking over the menu, I saw typical Greek food, but they also have other offerings such a lasagna and ravioli. \n\nI decided to start with the Mediterranean hummus which came topped with olives, sun dried tomatoes and olives and a side of warm pita The serving was huge and it was really tasty. I liked that it wasn't doused with olive oil and the hummus was allowed to stand on it's own. For my entree I got the gyro wrap, which was a huge wrap that was packed with beef, lamb, lettuce, tomato, grilled peppers and onions. This wrap was delicious! I'm not a person who seeks out lamb, but I enjoy it when the opportunity presents itself and I really enjoyed it here. For my side I got the pasta and marinara, which was okay, but nothing spectacular.\n\nBe aware that the Lebanese tea is nearly $4, which is a little pricier than other places. They did offer the 4 course lunch special on the day I was here, but it wasn't really Mediterranean food, so I decided to skip it. I would go back just for the hummus alone. I could have ordered that and another app and called it a day.",

For whatever reason, I don't always expect a great product or great service in the early am. Well, I had a late start for work one day and decided to stop in here for breakfast. I was greeted by the night manager who brought me a glass of water and breakfast menu to my seat. I was being greedy when I ordered both sausage links and scrapple with two eggs and home fries. This was the best breakfast that I've had out in awhile. The sausages were huge sage links. The scrapple was fried to a perfect crisp. And the eggs were cooked perfectly also, which is rare to get and often over cooked in most places. The home fries could have stood a little more griddle time to make them more crisp, but no big deal. \nPlenty of seating in this diner, and a pretty sizable breakfast menu. I was there at 3am, so I asked the manager if the dinner menu was available at this time of morning. His response was that all menus are available 24/7... He was friendly and more than accommodating.",

This is a chain store that buys and sells gently used clothing for teens, misses, women, men, & plus sized individuals, as well as footwear; handbags; & accessories. Its webpage advertises Plato's Closet as a business whose clients are in their \"teens and twenties;\" however, many of the clothing styles represented today could be worn by women & men of any age. \n\nShoppers can save up to 70% off retail prices. Overall, prices were lower than I expected, but I did find some items of clothing that were definitely overpriced considering they were pre-owned. This is a BAGLESS store, so come prepared! Customers have 7 days to return any items, but the tags must still be intact & accompany the original store receipt. \n\nShould you wish to earn extra money by selling your gently worn clothing, etc, BUYING HOURS are 10 AM to 8 PM Mon thru Fri; Sat 9 AM to 8 PM; & Sun 10 AM to 7 PM. Plato's Closet buys & sells Women's tops in size XS to 6x & bottoms size 00 to 30. For men, staff will buy size XS to 4x in tops & size 28 to 40 in bottoms. On each rack, there are LIMITED options available for those who are Plus size. Currently, if you wish to sell your \"trendy\" clothing, it should be Spring & Summer fabric/style. (I brought in a large bag that contained New w/ Tag winter clothing; I was sent packing. Lol.) At this time, MEN'S CLOTHING & ALL SHOES (especially shoes) are in HIGH DEMAND. Plato's does NOT buy underwear and/or PJs.\n\nWish to save even more? Once you sign up for the Rewards Program, you'll \"forever have access to exclusive discounts, promotions, & events. More points. More fun.\" Sign up online or sign up by texting PLATOSWC to 578-277.\n\nThis is a decent-sized store. It is clean, well-organized & brightly lit-- SEE PICS. The aisles are comfortably large, but too many racks were packed so tight that it was somewhat difficult to examine clothing without struggling to pull the hanger from the rack. (I had to retrieve at least 3 tops from the floor.) There are approximately 7 dressing rooms. Just outside each are metal folding chairs, a clothing return rack, & a bin for shoe returns-- SEE PICS.\n\nDuring today's visit, one young staff member was very friendly & wore a huge smile. The shift leader, though, never smiled & lacked a warm & fuzzy personality that often helps attract return visits. According to Plato's website, the company is hiring for full-time & part-time positions. Upload your resume online.\n\nBefore I drove off to donate my big bag of clothing to Salvation Army, I left the store w/ 3 never worn items of clothing priced $3 to $10 that this 50-yr-old (non-teen & non-twenty-something) plans to Rock! Lol. I LOVE fashion & I love deals, so it only makes sense for me to return once the fall/winter line hits the racks.",

  "text": "As Tampa is considered the home port of the Carnival Legend, I'm posting this review on this site and my comments are basically applicable to that ship though I boarded it in Long Beach, California with Sidney, Australia as my destination. \n\nI've spent a lot of time on various cruise ships of the Princess, Celebrity, Cunard and other lines, having done several transatlantic crossing, the islands of the Caribbean, spots on both the east and west coast of Mexico as well as some other countries, so I have a pretty good base for comparison. Though I can't say the Legend is the nicest of ships I've been aboard, it's a darn good one, but most importantly I can without any hesitation say it has been the most fun ship, the most friendly, has had some of the very best of entertainment, the very best of food and the most superlative of service of any ship I've been aboard. \n\nBeing aboard a ship for 23 days can often become somewhat boring, but not aboard the Legend. There were so many good and well thought out activities going on I even found myself often perplexed as to which to attend. \n\nAs for the food, it turned out to be of the best quality with some of the best and most uniquely prepared selections I've ever had and the service I had while dining was without any question totally top notch professional. \n\nAnother point that really set the Legend apart from others was the friendliness of the staff. They all seemed to be able to greet me by name and I can honestly say that I saw more of the captain of the Legend on any given days of my cruise than I ever saw of other captains during the entire time on other cruise ships.",

So I went in giving the place the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe Holiday Inn in Cherry Hill could be very nice.\nBut, no. Really, it's not.\n\nAs a budget hotel, I could see how one might be reasonably happy here. I've stayed in some really awful hotels and motels in my day. And the Holiday Inn in Cherry Hill isn't awful. It's just bleak.\n\nThe smell of industrial cleaners wafts over you in the long, greenish light of the compact-fluorescent lit hallway as you get to your adequately furnished room. I was glad to be traveling with some really nice beer to make the surroundings a bit less grim. \n\nIn the end, it did the job. We had a bed to sleep in, a shower to clean ourselves, and a sink to brush our teeth. The k-cup coffee maker provided a small jolt of caffeine in the morning. And we spent as little time as humanly possible in the actual hotel. \n\nBased on the expectations going in, I feel like I should give this place two stars. But in reality, I suppose it's fine, so three stars seems more fair. However, in all seriousness, I won't be coming back here. The next time I need a hotel in the area, I'll be looking for something better. And to me, that means two stars.",

Not to mention their beer.  \n\nMany places boast about their beer selection, but Oak & Stone is altogether another level.  They have like over 50 taps, all line up along the wall. You get a wristband, after having your ID checked, and then you can go to the taps and pour yourself whatever you want to try.  Each tap has a screen with the basic info and you can tap on the screen for a more detailed story.  The beers are mostly from Florida, up and down the state, with some limited releases, grouped by style.  They even have 4 or 5 ciders!  You are charged by how much you pour, down to 1/10 of an ounce, so you won't feel lose out if you happen to pour 4.1 oz. All of us love this system and keep leaving the table for more beer.  We end up drinking (and paying more) than if we were to just order a glass, but we all felt that the price is very reasonable for the amount we drink, and the ability to try just two or three oz of something without bothering anybody is priceless. \n\nOkay, on to the food... even though I admit I'll be back just for the beer... \n\nThe pizza has a lot of interesting toppings.  We get the fun guy (wordplay on fungi) which is so delicious, and the Far East, with Korean meatball, sesame slaw and even some molecular gastronomic soy sauce pearls. The latter is too sweet for my taste. The turkey burger was a little on the mushy side.  Overall, great beer, good enough food - what you'd expect from a beer-centric restaurant like this. \n\nService is phenomenal.  Needless to say, they are all ready to guide us through using the beer system and help us with the menu, but when we leave, they pour extra lemonade into little cups with straw for the kids to take along (and that's after a refill). How awesome is that!\n\nPlease please, Oak & Stone, make your way down south soon!!",

Assuming you're physically up for this, I think it's well worth it, because seeing a show here is really a special experience. Before I came here I had no idea that \"hall\" is a misnomer. The venue is about the size of a large studio apartment, so you are just a few feet away from these legendary musicians. I am no expert in jazz and basically tone deaf, but even I could tell they were incredibly talented.\n\nI will say that I could have really done without the guy behind me who must have been six hurricanes deep and shouted \"YEAH!!!\" or \"WOOOO\" directly into my ear seemingly every three seconds. Not only did it make me deaf in my left ear, it really interfered with my enjoyment of the jazz. I came here to hear the musicians, not drunk people screaming, which I could do literally anywhere else in New Orleans. Obviously not the venue's fault, but it did put a real damper on my experience. And unfortunately, once the show has started, it's not really possible to move around, so size up the people near you and if they look like idiots, move away before the show begins.",

  "text": "Why 2 stars? Because nothing turns me off more than pushy salesmanship.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nLately, I've been on a quest to find a place where I can get an oil change without having someone list the 13 things I could upgrade to or different system flushes that I need. I don't know why this is so hard to find, but in Tampa, it seems to be a requirement to try to rip people off if you're in the oil change business.\n\nI was in the area anyway and saw the great reviews here, so I figured I would give them a try. As I pulled up, there was literally no one in line, and this was the kind of place where you just stay in your car while they are working on it, which was perfect!\n\nThe guy (named Andreas) seemed to be having a lot of fun doing his job, as he was laughing and dancing as he worked. He was making a lot of jokes as he was putting my info in the system, which is definitely nicer than the person who is obviously miserable in their job. But that's about where the fun ended for me.\n\nHe begins quoting me on the different price options, and of course, he starts at the highest number, which is something crazy like $79.99. As he is working his way down the ridiculously high priced services, I see the list of prices next to my window. To see the cheapest options, it requires you to sit up in your seat and look all the way down to the bottom. I saw the lowest option was $36.99 so I said, \"let me stop you right there - I want the $36.99 oil change.\"\n\nHe said, \"wellllll.... I'm going to do something special for you...\" and then he began to whisper, \"I'm going to hook you up with a 25% discount for the high-mileage oil change at $54.99. What do you think about that?\"\n\nI was quickly trying to do the math in my head for 25% off $55, and then he whispered some more, \"Just nod your head and say yes...\" as he was giving me the creepiest stare and nodding his head up and down. \n\nI said, \"look, as long as it comes out to the same or less money than the $36.99 option, I'm good with that.\" \n\nHe said, \"yeah it actually might end up being cheaper.\"\n\nSo then he goes about doing the oil change with his partner and continues being loud, cracking jokes and trying to make small talk. At this point, I'm really annoyed at how I've once again found such an oil change place that's built upon up-selling and pressuring people. \n\nIt comes to the end of the service and he tells me the total is $45.69. I say, \"woah, what happened to $36.99 or cheaper.\"\n\nHe says, \"well after you have Uncle Sam and yadda yadda, you get to the $45.69. And see - only $3 more than the original oil change, plus you get better oil!\"\n\nSo here's what bothers me:\n\n1) The pressured up-selling to begin with, have I mentioned that?\n\n2) He told me that the price would be equal or less than the base-line oil change.\n\n3) The total came out to $3 more, which he obviously knew beforehand.\n\nDoes paying $3 more for something bother me? Absolutely not. But in principle, this level of sleaziness agitated me to my core. I write a ton of positive reviews for great local businesses that I love, but in this case, I'm so glad that we have Yelp to get the word out about people and businesses like this. In the past, consumers would have to deal with this kind of stuff without a way to warn others.\n\nSo now that we have this tool, here is my official warning: I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for your oil change, but sadly, I've yet to find a place that I can really vouch for! After my wife had a similar experience at another location, I know one thing for sure - I will never visit a Take 5 again.",

As a mall found courts go it is easy to move around and see all the restaurants.  Some of restaurants come and go and others are staples.\n  \nFood\n  Drinks - I went to the vending machine to get a bottle of Coke.  The machines are over by Sear's entrance.\n  \n  Appetizer - none\n\n  My Main Course - I went with the one item meal.  For the one item meal you get one protein and a choice of rice or noodles.  My wife and I decided to get the same protein, I got the rice and she got the noodles so we could try each other's.  My protein was the mango chicken.  I know this is fast food but this is classic blandness which did not even have a hint of mango.  The rice was the winner of this meal and it is a side dish.\n\n  Dessert - none.\n\nService - They had no problem with free samples and nice ladies working behind the counter.   They did have too many people working behind the counter as they were almost tripping over themselves.  This caused them to move a little slower because the extra people. \n\nFuture - I will continue to find a regular place at the mall.",

  "text": "There are some things in life that are factual and others that are opinions. At Midtown Wine & Spirits, it is a FACT that the selection is vast and diverse. If you question that FACT, you obviously haven't shopped there. Now on to my opinions...\n\nLiquor stores can sometimes have a seedy inclination but that is certainly not the case at Midtown as the structural building and interior is not only bright and even cheery but also clean and well laid out. As a dame who appreciates proper merchandising and layout, Midtown is kind of like the Nordstrom's of liquor stores. The staff is consistently friendly and helpful. They also offer up sound advice and information on their products which range from economical beers and wines to top shelf goodies. Shopping the other morning (yes, I start early), I had to stop myself from buying the 5 offerings of Corsair. Even I have limitations....\n\nI certainly appreciate that Midtown hosts and sponsors special events throughout Nashville which ties in the community. It should also be notated that they hosted the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey tasting during Yelp Drinks Week and from their representative's feedback, yelpers blew through 300 shots of the stuff in around an hour's time. \n\nI don't get to make my way out to Midtown as often as I should anymore with Woodland Wine Merchant right in my neighborhood but if I need selection, this is the spot to go. \n\nTIP: Sign up for their email list and social networking pages and you will get the scoop on their events!",

No doubt they serve come of the best Cuban food, and attract a large number of patrons.\n\nYou stand in line in front of the restaurant, order food at the counter and sit in one of the casual seating area outside. After going back and forth between the platos and sandwiches, I settled on the platos.\n\nThey offer four kinds of plates - with pork, chicken, vegetarian and tempeh. My choice was the much raved about lechon plate and my husband chose the chicken plate.\n\nEach plate comes with a generous amount of rice and beans, plantains and loaded with meat. Everything on the plate is super delicious, and I specifically enjoyed the rice and beans.\n\nI'd certainly recommend the lechon over the pollo!\n\nIf you're not too hungry, one plate can be happily split between two people. I was ravenous, yet I had some leftovers from my plate.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Bodega Cafe when you're in a mood for Cuban food.",

Usually I only go here for the baked goods (they have good dan tat's (aka. chinese egg tarts at $1.10), coconut buns (3 for $1.80), my friend got pineapple buns but they have everything - cha siu bau, etc.).  \n\nWent today for lunch and the place was packed with people!  Menu is pretty funny - they have a \"special\" for basically every time of the day. Anyways, service is fast and efficient.  Waitress is very nice and you get free tea.\n\nWe ordered green onion cakes ($4.25) which were nice and fluffy.  Typical chinese onion cakes and came with a hot sauce that gave it a little kick.  My friend ordered the noodle soup with BBQ duck ($7.25 I think) and I ordered the noodle soup with shredded cabbage and BBQ duck ($7.25 medium size).  Mine came with a ton of different vegetables (bean sprouts, snow peas, chinese choy/cabbage, etc.) which I liked as it seems you can't get enough veggies when you go to a chinese restaurant.  Bowl was pretty filling.  I finished it but my friend only ate about half of hers so she took the rest home.  Those bowls are definitely deceiving - after eating half, it looks you barely made a dent!\n\nTotal price of the bill was $20 before taxes = ridiculously good price. Cheap and good tasting food is always a win in my book.",

She grabbed the standard tongs and metal tray (standard for a Panaderia anyway) and was soon hunting the shelves for her favorites.  Most are behind sliding glass doors, but some were still sitting on racks waiting to be added.  \n\nCheck out had a slight delay, but was minimal.  \n\nThey have a wide variety of pastries to choose from including some I was not familiar with.  They also sell hot coffee, beverages, snacks, and do have whole cakes as well.\n\nAs far as quality, the flavors were really good.  Maybe because it was late morning, the texture was a bit chewy.  The crispy ones were still flaky, but there was a definite bite required to get through them like they had been sitting out a bit.  I also ordered one with jelly and the jelly that was visible on the outside was the only jelly the pastry had.  It may be standard, I don't know.  But it was disappointing.\n\nOverall, good flavors just not quite as good as the one about ten blocks away.\n\nReview #3116",

Actually, I shouldn't say that - a waiter at Sculley's managed it.\n\nSculley's is a waterfront restaurant in the John's Pass area - a boardwalk-type tourist attraction near Madeira Beach.  I ventured in with my family after an afternoon stroll along the Gulf.  I was windblown, salt-sprayed, happy and mildly sunburned.  I wanted a drink on an open-air patio and my father recommended Sculley's (he had been there before).\n\nFrom the moment we were seated, things went downhill.  Our waiter, quite possibly the most morose individual I have ever seen working a service job, came up and started telling us the dinner specials.  We interrupted him (nicely) because we didn't want him to waste his time.  We knew we were having drinks and maybe an appetizer, nothing else.  \n\nOur morose server's response:  (snotty voice) That's it?\n\nOh honey, wrong response.\n\nHe went away, we perused the menu and decided on drinks and a crab-stuffed mushroom dish.  Mr. Morose returned, took our order, again said \"That's it?\" and then SIGHED.  Excuse me?  \n\nHe brings back our drinks, slaps them down in front of whoever and walks away - no words.  \n\nMr. Morose returns with our mushrooms and actually brings extra little plates for us, drops everything with no interaction and retreats.  Perhaps he's getting a clue from the glacial waves of displeasure emanating from our little crew?\n\nI tipped the little f#*ker, but it was a near thing.  We almost asked for the manager on our way out, but preferred instead to just walk away.  Probably the wrong call, but there it is.\n\nThat one star up there is for the view, and for the decent mushrooms.  The service ruined my afternoon.",

Why the popcorn smell hits you like a ton of bricks is absurd, and I lerv popcorn. K moving past the popcorn. \n\nChecking out the shoes section, this area is incredibly unorganized. If you have the X-Men ability to change your shoe size (one that sometimes I wish I had considering only one of my friends have the same size feetsies) then opening boxes that say size 9 and getting a size 7 might be fun for you but truly, it'll start to make any Sasquatch feel a bit self-conscious. Their undies section is lacking in cuteness in this store, but if you're looking to go for the Little Mermaid look but are super lazy and like do be in PJs 24/7, they've got you completely covered (see pic). \n\nMy friend wanted to shop for some office supplies, and again, lacking in organization and cuteness whereas the other locations really own it.",

It breaks my heart to give them to an organization who is for-profit and doesn't have the same belief systems as me (ie Salvation Army, Goodwill, etc). \n\nI recalled from during a previous house move donating to the Assistance League of Santa Barbara. What I love about this organization is they keep all their proceeds local to help those who are specially abled. Not to mention, during the Holidays that have a fun and free drive-thru light show!\n\nI called to confirm their hours and stopped by their location off of Veronica Springs in the Hidden Valley. The parking lot is tricky so I added a GPS map with arrows of the one way road that passes the thrift store's donation drop off.\n\nRemember: When making donations, keep it local to help the community you live in. Open your heart this New Year!",

The bar actually has three separate bars right by each other all located right on the beach. They've got plenty of seating at the bars or right in the sand and the prices really can't be beat. I won't go into details but I'll just say that it was the worst service at a non-busy bar that I think I've had in years. Still if you're willing to put up with crappy service so you can get a cheap drink on a beautiful beach, Undertow is still a great way to go.",

Goodness, there were about one dozen other cars while I was there. \n\nI went with some special at about $22 that gave me the full exterior wash, a wash for the belly of the car and the interior clean along with a spiffy shine on the tires at the end. Good reasonable price. But I was super aggravated with the attendant. \n\nWhen I drove up, he asked me if I had \"tried\" to wash my car. Eh? \"You have some serious calcium build up here. Did you try to wash your car?\" It occurred to me what he was referencing -- I parked my car in a spot that, unknowingly, had a sprinkler system nearby. I returned to find my car splattered with spots. \n\n\"I would recommend getting a wax because I am not sure a wash is going to get all of that out.\" \n\nNow, he's the professional. But, goodness, you would think that he would have been able to tell that I had gotten my car waxed recently -- no more than one month prior to be precise. No? Didn't notice? Oh, OK. \n\nI told him I wouldn't be getting a wax that day; I just got my car waxed. His response: \"Hopefully it will come off then.\" \n\n...hopefully?! Isn't that the point of a wax job? \n\nEven after this brief exchange, he still tried to up-sale me on something else. Goodness me! \n\nBut, tell you folks, when another attendant waved me over because my car was set to go, I was thoroughly impressed. She looked gorgeous! ...until I got in the car. Excellent job on the vacuuming, but there was still dust on parts of the dash and steering column. Boo!\n\nBut this wasn't a detail job, folks, so I can't be overly critical there.",

  "text": "This is one of the best parks I've visited in central Indiana, and if you look at my Yelp review history, you'll see I've visited a lot of parks! This lady knows her parks, mmmkay?\n\nHummel Park in Plainfield is impressive for many reasons: it's huge (205 acres!), it has multiple playgrounds (like 4!), it has a splash pad, it has a baseball field and basketball courts, it has a great area to creek stomp with lots of shallow places for kids to wade, it has paved walking trails, it has a bridge, it has a amphitheater, it has clean restrooms, and a lot more that I'm forgetting. Also, it's really clean and well-taken-care-of. \n\nPeople with kids definitely need to visit this park. Like I said, there are four different playgrounds, so you could spend a lot of time here going from playground to another. The biggest playground area is located in the southeast part of the park. This playground includes a vintage twirly slide, but also a more modern playground structure with multiple slides, tunnels, bridges, monkey bars, poles to slide down and rope ladders to climb up. The playground is accessible to kids of all abilities, and includes a ramp entrance into the playground structure. This part of the park also has swings, including a saucer swing, as well as a separate playground for toddlers, and a big sand box.\n\nThe splash pad is located in this area of the park, too. It's a great size for toddlers. I wouldn't visit this park just for the splash pad, because there are other parks in the area with bigger splash pads, but it's nice that there's one here and that it's so close to the playground.\n\nThere is another playground near the performing arts center, which includes a toddler playground and a playground for bigger kids. A short walk away from this playground is a nature playground, with manufactured boulders and rope webs that kids can climb and explore.\n\nPaved trails offer an easy walk or stroll. As you meander through the park, you'll probably cross over a bridge that's suspended over White Lick Creek, which runs through the middle of this park, and it flows from the north part of the park to the south part. There are five small lakes within Hummel Park, including Blue Heron Lake. Hummel Park is also a great place to go creek stomping, because the creek bed includes many shallow areas where kids can wade in the water.\n\nI've heard that the sledding hill at Hummel Park is amazing, so I'll have to visit in the winter with my kids.",

Not sure how many acres of land Laumeier sits on, but it's a LOT! And I love the fact that they are very \"hands off\" with letting people roam the grounds. As long as you don't harm the grounds or the pieces of art (OR do something really stupid in front of others), attendees can pretty much do whatever they want here. \n\nThis is a perfect picnic spot in the warmer months, but also a fun place to explore when it's cold. I'm not one to really enjoy physical activity, but hiking around Laumeier is one of my favorite things to do, no matter what time of year. Standing next to the sculptures puts our existence in the world into perspective, too. \n\nStopped by here last night for the opening reception to the Art Fair and it's really impressive to see that much land covered with tents, art, and people. It was windy and chilly last night and there were still 500 people there - at least! Hope that even more stop by over the weekend to support this awesome and FREE park in STL!",

I walked in to this small humble spot  and found two of the nicest women working. They used to work from a food truck and as business increased they opened up a brick establishment. Congratulations.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork dinner which came with 2 sides. The pulled pork was ok. I asked for the hot bar-b-que sauce. The sauce tasted like a hot sauce and not a hot bbq  sauce. I went with the potato salad which was pretty good. I also got the baked beans. I found them to be way to sweet for my taste. These I could not eat. Not a big fan of baked beans anyway. I wish they had more veggies to choose from. None of the sides were appealing to me. All were quite starchy. I'm used to collards and cole slaw. Creature of habit.  I prefer a few other bbq restaurants in town. Unfortunately, I will not be back. Judge for yourself though because they do have quite the following. They are only opened Wednesday thru Saturday with limited hours. This is a to-go place, although they have a few tables. I wish them continued success.",

  "text": "It seemed to me anyway that my arrival in New Orleans became official only upon entering this storied little music hall. It is as chaotic and messy as one might expect, and on a busy night one can expect drinks to be spilled down on you from the balcony above, a crowd apparently unconcerned with personal space or possible sexual harassment complaints, and a men's bathroom with the urinal partially visible to those on the outside. It is what it is.\n\nThat being said, the acoustics were excellent, and the first show I went to see was clearly audible but non-painful throughout the night. Parking on the street might require one to walk a couple of blocks, but this isn't bad (I would suggest sticking to the well-lit Napoleon avenue). Getting a VIP ticket so you can be the one spilling drinks on the poors is probably well worth it if you have the money. The acts they get are certainly are worth seeing, and if you come from afar looking for the distinctive New Orleans mix of passionate artistry and urban decadence, you'll get it.",

  "text": "This hotel was mostly convenient for my first trip to Nola/Essence Festival! Easy walk to popular spots like the French Market, Bourbon Street and Canal Street, but bit of a further walk to the Superdome (where the concerts were being held) and the convention center, but doable - wear comfy shoes! I saw those women struggling in heels down the street and it was hot...whew chile!\n\nWith the insane volume of folks in town for the festival, in addition to local residents, and other tourists, uber and lyft didn't make much sense. We got to most places faster on foot.  Sometimes when we took uber/lyft,m they never wanted to drop us off even close to the hotel due to the traffic and we ended up walking anyway. \n\nSo back to the hotel review. To be real, for the price we paid, I expected a bit more. Maybe because it was during Essence Festival and they knew they could charge what they did. The hotel staff was mostly helpful and courteous.  Can't speak for housekeeping folks though - had a few interactions with them and they were not the friendliest. \n\nWe stayed on the 19th floor. In order to get to this floor, you take the elevator to the 18th floor then another elevator to go up one floor. Yes, weird, but that's how it is.  Speaking of elevators, they're very small and tiny.  I'm claustrophobic but still...I don't think more than 6 adults should be on here at once but yet folks were forcing themselves onto the elevator - super rude and annoying! \n\nI was really surprised there was no fridge in the room.  The room itself was small. It is connected to a restaurant downstairs (Old Saint) and I think that was where room service comes from.  To my knowledge this hotel didn't offer complimentary breakfast or happy hour (not must haves for my hotel stays, but they are nice incentives).\n\nI believe there is a pool here but didn't use it.  I took advantage of the coffee and coffee machine in the room.  The first day we had two bottles of water in the room and I expected them to replenish water daily but that was not the case.  I did observe on my last night they had many bottles on a table in front of the elevator on my floor. Where was the water all this time? I was spending money on water at the Unique grocery store across the street (that place was \"unique\" indeed).\n\nWould I stay here again? Probably not. I'm sure there are better options around.  I think this hotel could use some upgrades. Just my lil two cents.",

The entire process was very frustrating for both us and the installers. I'm not sure if this was just a fluke or how they normally do business.\n\nWe had problems from the get-go. It had to be measured 3 times before ordering the awning. After waiting 3 weeks a main beam was missing from the order. Unfortunately, this wasn't found until the old awning was removed so we waited another two weeks for that to arrive. All the while being told on Friday afternoon the part would arrive on Monday and they'd finish the job on Monday. Didn't happen nor did we receive a phone call. Two weeks passed and they arrived to install the new awning. This time they confused jobs with another home on the same street name and thought they had completed our home.\n\nThey struggled installing the awning and keep removing what they had installed and started over again and again. The man told us they could finish the installation in one day but it took a full week. When they were close to finished the one man was going to install the last few pieces the next day but he never showed on Friday. He returned Monday with a supervisor and they struggled but completed the job. My husband had to point out several things that had to be corrected. One being a beam was installed upside down. The job is finally complete and the awning looks nice. By the way, our Contractor was assisting and keep in contact with Richmond Exteriors.\n\nThere were so many promises and apologies I lost track. The Supervisor apologized and said everything just went wrong and they had problems. The installers were friendly, tidy and frustrated as much as we were. I don't think we'd hire them after our ordeal. They do many things from roofing, siding, fences plus more so maybe their better suited for those skill sets. \n\nThe Contractor said they'd never had problems with Richmond before if that would matter to you. I just know this installation had poor communication, shorts work days, they appeared baffled and days turned into weeks. Yes, I understand no project ever goes as planned but this was ridiculous.",

It runs along the Wissahickon, and there's lots to see, from rock faces and vegetation to the creek itself.\n\nIt's well-traveled, safe and peaceful. You're never alone. Watch for bikers, joggers, walkers, and riders on horseback. Once I saw a tyke on a Power Wheels car! If you get lost, there are markers along the path so you can tell emergency personnel exactly where you're picnicking.\n\nThere's a cafe by one of the trail's entrances that I've yet to check out...",

  "text": "The Roosevelt was a fantastic place to attend a conference during the Christmas season.  Their holiday decorations are truly spectacular, and as a Waldorf Astoria property, the service and amenities are top notch.  The location was also fantastic.  You're close enough to walk to the tourist-y things, but removed enough from the hustle and bustle to relax.\n\nMy room was generously sized, but I was bummed when I saw they had put me right next to the elevators.  Thankfully, the noise was minimal, so it was not a significant issue.  The mattress was amazing, and the linens and other amenities were great.  I particularly appreciated the two complimentary bottles of water in each room.  The one thing the room was sorely lacking was electrical outlets, particularly around the desk area.  With a work phone, personal phone, and Ipad to charge, I ended up using the outlets in the bathroom, which of course was less than ideal.\n\nThe conference I attended required a unique table/chairs set up and complicated A/V equipment, all of which was executed perfectly.  The food was also much, much better than your typical hotel food.  Every buffet at every meal had a variety of well-prepared options.  The breakfast pastries were particularly tasty, and they kept the coffee flowing (and it was good coffee too).  While a guest, I also took advantage of the hotel bar, which was appropriately swanky and full of good people watching.  \n\nAll in all, this was a great spot to stay on a quick trip to New Orleans.",

  "text": "Have you ever had a chain restaurant experience where someone you know says, \"Oh man, you've got to try this new restaurant. It's got great food on the menu and I know you'll like it.\" - so you make plans to try this \"great new restaurant\", only to find that it's a chain?\n\nThat's happened to me before with The Cheesecake Factory and Maggiano's. Not that I'm complaining. The food at both of these places isn't terrible. I would probably only give Cheesecake Factory two stars (because apparently, calling ahead for a reservation gets you nowhere) but Maggiano's isn't too shabby. \n\nThe portions here are huge. Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. No way I'm going to finish a plate of food here. And not sure if their leftovers reheat too well. \n\nBut the chocolate cake? Oh dear God, it's good! I'm never one to turn down a giant slice of cake, and Maggiano's is no exception. This stuff is sinful... and don't think that I'm above taking a slice home for later too :)",

  "text": "My friends Joel and Lela have been raving to me about Alyan's, so when I was recently in the area I decided to swing by for lunch. The restaurant is basic and no-frills, a great spot for lunch or a quick dinner. \n\nI had the chicken kabob platter which came with a small salad, some grilled veggies, hummus and pita. I asked to sub tzatziki for the sesame sauce but they didn't have any made up, so I asked for a side of hot sauce instead. Good call there, because their hot sauce is homemade and very tasty. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and I enjoyed stuffing it into the pita with some hot sauce and hummus. The side salad wasn't anything exciting. I would have preferred a side of tabbouleh. Still, when all was said and done I was stuffed and had no guilty feelings since everything was relatively healthy. Next time, I'm hitting up the fries everyone seems to rave over!",

I was blown away by the quality of the production - it felt like I was in a much bigger venue and the sound was phenomenal!\n\nThe cast did an awesome job!  I don't want to admit it but I'll be honest, I had never seen Hairspray before.  I know, I know... You ask how is this possible?  Am I not a child of the 80's?  Now it's my civic duty to ensure my chitlins don't miss out on this phenomenal show!\n\nI think I may even come back for a second stint to take my Mom for Mother's Day!  \n\nThe venue was gorgeous with ample parking all around the building.  \n\nThe dinner buffet is open 2 hours before the curtain rises and be sure to snag some desserts to save for intermission because you'll be so full from all the amazing eats that you won't be able to have dessert right away!\n\nHighlights for me included the prime rib and yorkshire pudding - Yummy!  There was a P.E.I. mussels station manned by a chef.  And my personal fave, the cold seafood bar!   Salmon, squid, and the best - thai marinated cold juicy plump mussels!  I may have visited the seafood station more than once ;-)\n\nTruly, there was something for everyone from chicken to beef to pasta to seafood.  Loads of salads and vegetarian options, too.  A real stand out was curried fish!  I know, hey?  Not what I was expecting but phenomenal!  If you smile and ask really nice, the chefs will even bring you a copy of the recipe! \n\nThank you Mayfield Dinner Theatre for a wonderful night out :-)  I will be sure to be back!",

It's up the street.\n\n3 stars because my fave item is no longer available and nothing else is as good. They stopped serving the grilled fish tacos several years back and I don't like fried fish tacos. Also the chips that you get are tasty for the most part, but the seasoning is never even. You tend to get one salty ass chip with all the seasoning on it and another with nothing on it at all. I do wish you received salsa or guac with them. Hot sauce isn't hearty enough for chips and I'd rather add hot sauce to the salsa. I know, I know you can order salsa or guac, but when it's complimentary and I really wasn't coming for chips...you just want what you get at the Mexican restaurant...not half of it.\n\nThe service at this location is phenomenal. I felt I had to say that. They check on you quite a bit even when sitting outside.",

  "text": "Great place to stop for some good food, good beer, and good conversation.\n\nI have to echo what my friend, Kristi S., wrote in her review. I completely agree that I'm open to giving this place five stars because I have the feeling this place will wow me. Maybe one day I'll look back at this review and think, I was an idiot, but my visit here was a solid four stars, which still makes me a fan!\n\nIt was a 30 minute wait for indoor seating on a Saturday night. They definitely double downed on the outside seating, since I would say the size of the indoor seating is the same as the size of the outdoor. I have a huge fear of mosquitos (hey we live in Florida!) so the day I decide I'm ok with getting Zika is the day I'll sit outside in the summer. (If I know I will have to sit outside I will bathe in bug spray and everyone dining with me has to deal with the smell.) Luckily, there is a long communal table that is first come first serve, so I didn't have to sit outside (which is also first come first serve) or wait the thirty minutes. \n\nMy friend and I both went with the flight of four beers, deciding to share. This means we got to try a total of eight beers. We're dark beer drinkers, so this means we tried every porter/stout/brown ale they had on their menu (and then had to pull a couple non-dark beers to hit our eight). Honestly, I enjoyed them all. Some of the beers are seasonal and tbh, when I do beer flights unless the beer name is written down in front of me, I can't keep them straight. You'll have to come and try them yourself.\n\nI got the Beer B Q Turkey Burger. Maybe this is my fault, since it is in the name, but I wasn't a fan of the beer b q sauce. I found it overwhelming. It also came with fried jalapenos which I picked out (I am not a spice person). The bun was perfectly buttered. I honestly planned to just pick at the bun, but I ate the whole thing! If you're on a diet and think you have willpower, you're wrong and should just order it without the bun. I got the cheesy mashed potatoes as my side and man they were cheesy! I loved it. \n\nI had serious food envy as I watched other plates pass by me. The calzones were ginormous! Seriously, that could feed a family. The pretzels looked huge as well! That's an entree size and then some. They don't skimp on portions here.\n\nI definitely enjoyed this place. I'm a fan!",

  "text": "Monday after Monday the organizers of 'Triple M' pull off an incredible evening of healthy living, by bringing hundreds of Tucsonans into the heart of downtown for a walk/run, rain or shine and holidays too! \n\nWithout a doubt, this social walk/run has become one of my favorite reasons to put on a pair of workout shorts and tie up my Mizunos. Check-in begins at 5:15, with the walking and running groups taking off shortly after that. The scenic trail traverses through some of downtown's most well known (and a few hidden) neighborhoods. Walkers and runners reconvene around 7 for live music and a free raffle. THAT'S RIGHT! Prizes for good health! What's not to love? And if that wasn't enough, show up seven times and you'll be the proud owner of a Meet Me At Maynards T-shirt. Run with your shirt on anywhere in the world, snap a shot and they'll throw it on the website. Run with your shirt off and......well......if you can run with your shirt off you've already won. I on the other hand am still in training so it'll be a while. \n\nWalking or running not your thing? They recently added a slew of other activities for a small cost. How about yoga for four bucks, or spinning for five? Does Zumba rhythm get your heart pumping? That class is three bucks or you can take a pilates class for five. Be sure to check in though, because with the red MMM that they stamp to your palm, you'll get discounts at participating restaurants. Bring the kids, bring your dog, everyone is welcome.\n\nSo to recap, a free walk/run, seven times you get a shirt, cheap fitness classes if you aren't a runner, and discounts on food. I'll see you next Monday, right? That's what I thought.",

  "text": "Even on Saturday morning, Rt. 73 in Marlton is a pain in the butt to drive, but at least it now has Bhan Thai as a worthy destination, making the traffic and crazies causing it, tolerable. \n\nI hadn't eaten a good Thai meal in many months, and decided a few days before to get up early this weekend and cruise across the Burlington Bristol Bridge and down 295 to this well reviewed Vietnamese kitchen. Arriving just as it opened at 11:30, I walked into an empty dining room and was greeted by a friendly Asian woman who welcomed me and confirmed I could dine outside on their umbrellaed patio. Seemed like the safer way to go in this renewed age of raging Delta Covid. \n\nI went with faves, Tom Kha Soup and Drunken Noodles (veggie), 'Thai Spicy'. They threw in a sushi orange ginger dressing salad, which was a surprise. The Tom Kha was excellent, with plenty of fresh mushrooms, sliced chicken, carrots, onion, coconut milk and lemongrass for kicks. Loved each and every slurp. The Drunken was a large plate with extra wide noodles and lots of colorful veggies.\n\n It also came with plenty of cubed tofu pan sauteed to a near burnt finish. The heat was there, although not the conflagration desired. The taste of the overdone tofu while subtle, was enough to through the flavor of the dish slightly off. So, while it was still recognizable, it could have been much better with a more deft hand holding the pan. \n\nBhan Thai is a reasonable facsimile of a genuine attractive Thai restaurant, but candor requires referencing that better can be found in and around Philly, Central Jersey, and closer to home. \n\n3.75 STARS.",

  "text": "FireGirl Mexican Kitchen sits in a less than state of the art strip mall on Street Road in Bensalem, Pa.  Word is that in a past life it was also a Mexican joint called Tortilla Flats.  Someone has a talent for interesting names. \n\nWe stopped in on Sunday for a late lunch in the midst of shopping in the vicinity. The large room was brightly painted with unusual lighting fixtures and plenty of tables, low and high, for dining.  Ordered were taken at the back cashier stand by a friendly native who was happy to explain how their system worked, and to quickly agree that their Flautas were a good way to go.  \n\nThey arrived at our high top about 10 minutes later.  Rather than the normal flute-like crunchy tubes stuffed with Chicken, Cheese, and Peppers, this version was more of a roll up or wrap. The three filled tortillas had been sliced amidship after deep fryin, and were still soft rather than rigid.  In the middle of the plastic basket were small containers of Guacomole, Salsa, Cheese Sauce and Sour Cream.  While we were waiting we located the Hot Sauce Bar against the rear side wall, and brought back several small cups of various blasters to try with our meal.  All were good, but the Spicy Peach Sauce was far and away our favorite due to its sweet/heat quotient.  Tasted great poured onto each Flauta and immediately consumed.  \n\nThe order was enough for both of us.  The taste was fine, if not completely authentic.  It was definitely designed for the American palette, which is not a bad thing.  They know their audience.  \n\nI don't get to this part of Street Road often, but will be returning in a few weeks to pick up something ordered at the curtain shop next door.  If hungry when I arrive, I would not mind returning to FireGirl to see what else they have in the kitchen.",

  "text": "Good place for a team dinner.  Prices are reasonable and the food quality is great!  Try alligator for app - and it's made from gator loin meat - so is tender and delicious! Also good is the deconstructed crawfish pie. For entree, I suggest gumbo or the shrimp n grits.  And, if you can get a cup...you gotta try the shrimp & crawfish bisque (only limited availability).  Chef RJ and sous chef, Tori, are incredible.  The waitstaff, Jake especially, is fantastic.  And RJ and bartender, Josh, can concoct a specialty drink, Ahi Martini (yes, you heard me!).  Signature drinks include both Saint & Sinner (personally I am sinner fave).",

Everything from re-purposed furniture to shabby chic furnishings to vintage Americana to original art.  I will definitely head back over come Christmas shopping time.\n\nThings I was tempted to buy: a 1930s era photo of Grand Isle, an xray photograph of a flower by a retired MD, a vintage spice cabinet, and several gaudy costume broaches. \n\nThe store actually faces Focis, but you can't miss the round, former waterbed store in front of it.",

We stopped by and we're surprised by how much we enjoyed the pizza. \n\nWe got a large Margherita pizza and loved the cheese and crust. It came out piping out and pretty quick. We have already come back and gotten another too. The pizza is pretty greasy, but I think that's also might be what makes it so good. Excited to try some of the more unique pizzas too. \n\nThe interior space is pretty and there are big tables for families and groups as well. It's very modern, comfortable and chill. They have a big craft beer list and it includes several local breweries. \n\nDefinitely come check them out!",

  "text": "Bridge Review\n\nWhat a beautiful place with such an interesting history. I think that people often look the history and look straight to the fact that people die here monthly and sometimes even weekly due to the pandemic. \n\nI came here on a whim when I was in Williamson County. I was driving in the area and thought I would finally check it out since I had seen photos on Instragram of this pretty bridge. I like visiting unique architectural structures and this falls in line with that quirky interest I have. \n\nI parked my car in front of a call box on one end of the bridge where it offered a \"HELP CALL\" on it. Additionally, there was a sign posted close by insisting to call if you feel suicidal with a phone number on it. I feel this is a great resource to have onsite at this bridge. It is important for people to be aware that they do not have to do this and that there are resources available to get them through.\n\nUpon passing the call box, I walked on the bridge and enjoyed snapping some pretty photos. There were a couple of other people out there as well, but on the other side of the bridge and at a distance. I really just enjoyed soaking of the views that went for miles and miles. The clouds and the in and out sun really created some lovely shots and had some moody feels that added to the experience. Moody feels as in you could feel varying levels of emotions that ran through your veins knowing the unfortunate events that take place here regularly. \n\nMessages of sadness, encouragement, and simply random quotes align the railings of the bridge. One that particularly stuck out to me was, \"you're beautiful and you're worth it.\" Something so simple could remind someone that this isn't the way to go and hopefully has touched someone's heart. It touched mine, and I was there to take pictures.\n\nUpon my return and getting in my car, a policeman pulled up behind my car. My initial thought was that I was in trouble for parking where I did. There was no signage in my parking area saying that I was not able to, but instead he came up to my window to ask if I was \"OK\". I said that I was and asked why. Then it dawned on me the minute I asked before he replied as to why. I quickly stated my purpose of being there. He didn't ask me for my license or anything. We talked briefly and exchanged pleasantries. \n\nAt a point in the conversation, I asked him how often they patrolled the area and said upwards to 40 times a day. I didn't believe that to be an exaggeration. He mentioned there had been an increase in \"activity\". What was usually once a month had spiked since the pandemic occurred seeing as many as 2 to 3 suicides in a month. I feel that this is great that the police department is aware and alert of the area. Plus, they recognize the sensitivity they need to express to help people who are in distress.  \n\nI feel there will come a time when I drive the entire parkway all the way to Natchez, Mississippi. It seems like a fun bucket list item to do similar to driving Route 66, but shorter and less of a time commitment. I think that there is a lot of history to be seen on this route and it would be a fun experience to take.",

This is not for the feint of heart you will spend money and lots of it.  \n\nFor starters we ordered the deluxe  shellfish platter.  $85.  This came with whole lobster, king crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and oysters.  It was more than enough for 4 people.  It so much that everyone having finished amended what they were going to order and the sides for the main course.\n\nI ordered the NY strip steak bone in with maytag blue cheese on top. I ordered it cooked medium and it was cooked to perfection.  All the beef is rated as prime which is the highest grade available.  I was somewhat underwhelmed with the steak.  The flavor was not quite what I would expect for prime and the blue cheese overwhelmed  the steak, my bad.  I also ordered a side of grilled Brussels sprouts.  This was a simple dish made complicated.  It did not need the walnuts and the over the top garlic.  I would have preferred the sprouts a little simpler.\n\nMrs. K. ordered the petit filet and a massive baked potato.  I must report her steak was cooked per her preference and the potato was huge.  We brought home the potato untouched and a couple of bites out of the filet.\n\nEverything about this place is first class from the service to the restrooms.  I mean it was so fancy it had ice cubes in the urinal. :)",

I have never seen a boat being taken off of a slip and transported into the water with a forklift before so that was pretty neat! The marina has bathrooms (learned this after coming back later) and a well stocked convenience store that had beer and snacks. My only woe is the location which is kind of a more rural side of Dunedin and amongst other marinas, making it a little hard to find. Other than that, great place to keep your boat!",

  "text": "Nice little bakery specializing in FIlipino breads. Since keeping inventory fresh is a priority, everything is baked in small batches to ensure quality. I love siopao (pronounced shoe pow), which is basically a steamed bun with your choice of pork or chicken inside of it. The version they make here are massive. Best way to eat these are to keep them refrigerated, then wrap in a wet paper towel and nuke for about 2 minutes and they come out steaming hot and tasty.\n\nThey have a small steam table and have a handful of dishes. As is what seems to be a standard practice in every Filipino restaurant, none of the dishes were labeled, so it was a guessing game to figure out what each dish was. The owner was very helpful.  I ended up with some yummy pancit, jasmine rice and some sort of lechon (roast pork) dish. Everything was really good.\n\nMy only recommendation for improvement would be more labeling of food (so people who aren't so familiar with the food won't have to ask questions about every dish) and listing pricing. I had no idea what things cost until I was ready to pay for things.",

  "text": "Good food, but certainly not the best in Tampa. I ordered 3 tacos: chicharron, ribeye, and fish and a side of retried beans and horchata. \n\nIt's hard to know what you're going to get with chicharron, this place did pork rinds. They were alright. Lots of toppings certainly helped. I would prefer pork belly. \n\nThe ribeye was alright - not as flavorful as a carne Saad's or some other steak option. The taco was a little dry - I guess you could add toppings to fix that - but they were already a little pricey.\n\nFish taco was the better one. Solid fish and toppings. It was almost near the quality of Cali Tacos, but Cali Tacos in my past expedience is superior (it's been awhile so I could be wrong).\n\n\nThe tacos weren't bad - they just weren't that impressive either. The side of refried beans came in a tiny container - it was good, but a better portion would've been better.\n\nProbably the thing dragging down this review the most was the horchata. I'm from California and horchata is really important to me. The horchata here was syrupy and didn't have a good flavor to it. It almost tasted like powder and I started coughing after drinking it.\n\nOrder total was around $14 which isn't that cheap for tacos and a drink.\n\nOverall, Loli's is definitely not a bad place for Mexican food, but definitely not the best in Tampa. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.",

  "text": "We were a party of 4 stopping in for dinner during a day in Santa Barbara. The atmosphere was a bit strange, as we first noticed the outdoor patio area, which had a nicely dressed young lady playing classical piano. The inside also looked elegant. But then there were large TV's everywhere with sports on. It was as if a sports bar and a fine dining restaurant had a baby - but a strange one.\n\nThe staff, although friendly, seemed very young, unprofessional, and poorly trained. They were good kids, just didn't really fit the establishment. For instance, when someone in our party asked about the fish of the day, the server told us it was an Atlantic Sea Bass - which we ordered. We waited a while for our food, and about the time I was expecting it would be coming out, the server returned only to tell us that the fish of the day was actually a Cod. What? It was strange that A) he didn't know the fish of the day, B) he waited so long to tell us there was a mistake, and C) he didn't apologize for the error. Something else was ordered in its place, but it was then delivered later than the other entrees which came out. It was poor execution. Also, when we initially sat down and were poured waters, the water was warm - no even room temperature, but actually warm. When they refilled them, it was cold water with ice in it, but it seems like the initial pitcher must have been sitting out for a long time.\n\nI had ordered the salmon salad, which was much smaller than what I had imagined an entree salad to be. The salmon was mediocre, and the small salad was missing one of the key ingredients the menu mentioned it included. I'm not sure if they were just out of the ingredient and they didn't want to tell me, or if it was just another mistake. The food was definitely overpriced for what it was.\n\nIn conclusion, the restaurant seemed confused on whether they were a classical piano playing fine dining restaurant or a sports bar. The staff was nice, but very young and seemingly very inexperienced. The food is nothing special and portion sizes are small and lacking quality. There are plenty of dining establishments in Santa Barbara, and I would recommend going elsewhere.",

Well let me tell you, I've only had the tacos once, but they might have been the best damn thing on the menu.\n\nWhat's even possibly better than the amazing food, is what these guys did with this building. I never went to Taps & Tequila, but it looked pretty unappealing from the outside. Upon my first visit to Hawkers, I could not even believe my eyes when I saw the building in all of its glory. If you told me that they bulldozed the existing building, and built this one from scratch - it'd be easier to believe. This transition was an extreme one - from a non-descript, forgettable bar, to a building so classy, that it transforms the entire block. I will never be able to fathom how this was done. I bow to the owners for the work of art that is this building.\n\nI say it in every review I write for this part of town - what DTSP has transformed into, in the last 5 years, is utterly remarkable. I used to hate driving to St. Pete, and now I wish I could go every day!",

If I knew anything about cooking I would recreate this sauce and enter it into every sauce contest I could find. Now the horrible news, Complete roll failure.  Because I have very strong feelings for this sauce and I'm feeling froggy I'm going to give a spoiler alert from my next video where they may have found a cure for roll failure. In my next video, this worked very well and there was no roll failure.  I humbly suggest putting sliced cheese on the roll before the steak and sauce combination.  Very good Cheesesteak experience.",

We never bought anything here. \n\nSo why did we come so often? They have an Amazon locker in the back of the store! It was incredibly convenient. Put in your order number or scan your barcode and the locker door pops open with your package inside. \n\nThis is a great option when you don't have somewhere good for a delivery. \n\nThis review is really more for Amazon, but kudos to RiteAid for putting the locker in. \n\nThe store was very clean and modern looking as well.

I wouldn't really say that I was dissapointed, but I wasn't necessarily amazed either.\n\n   I found it very strange that it was a sports bar and Italian restaurant combined...I have never seen anything like it before. \n\n  We started out with the buffalo chicken dip which was alright, but we were a little upset that it wasn't even spicy at all! We also never received silverware until we asked for it.In fact, the service in general was very awkward and just meh.\n\n   I ordered a glass of the Berringer White Zhiffandale and it was SOO GOOD. It literally tasted like a liquid candy drink. I got the Cajun pasta as my entree and it was very fresh and great! I had never had anything like it, but I definitely want to get it again! \n\n  This place looks like a good stop to swing by at after a baseball game or checking out the arch. There's probably a bunch of other better places around the area, but Caleco's was pretty decent.",

  "text": "As soon as I walked into Opa, it was a sight for this sore Phoenician's eyes when compared to the rest of Tucson. Cozy dining with comfy seating, and a fountain I wish I could have by my own front door. We were seated promptly by our kind host (I'll assume he is the manager), and before we could even look at the menu, we were given complimentary pita with hummus and tzatziki. The hummus was freaking delicious! The tzatziki was thick and satisfying.\n\n\"Do you wanna look at the wine menu? Or is it too early for that?\" haha the manager cracks me up. It was only noon, but I almost ordered a glass for the hell of it, because this is a fun place that inspires you to indulge. \n\nThe menu was overwhelming. Pitas...vegetarian menu...wraps. For some reason the wraps just stuck out--with mushrooms, melted feta cheese, with a side of salad and rice? Why is this only $10? Instead of trying out gyro meat or chicken, I got brave, took your suggestions, and ordered the filet mignon wrap. I can already hear your cries now. \"But Taric , wraps aren't Greek!\" I'm sure a society that old produced more than one sort of unleavened bread. STFU and open wide.\n\nAnyways, I'm not big on red meat, but this was delicious. The mignon had that hint of wine it was cooked in, and all that feta, tomato, and mushroom in there made it heaven in my mouth until that last tasty bite. The salad was topped with\n\n\"OPA!!!\"\n\nYour meal will be interrupted by this shout, while someone's dish is being lit with a tremendous fire that distracts the whole room. I don't know what they ordered, but I sure as hell wanted one.\n\nOkay...where was I? Oh yeah, the salad was topped with ample feta cheese, a roasted slice of red bell pepper, and a kalamata olive. Not sure what was in the rice, but I wouldn't mind finishing a plate of that by itself. The tzatziki in the side wasn't even necessary, but that didn't stop me from using it anyway!\n\nFor desert, my date and I split the passionberry duo. A thin layer of cake as the foundation, with a wafer of chocolate sandwiched between two flavors of airy mousse. Drizzled with a delicious, fruity sauce, a couple of berries, and surrounded with a moat of whipped cream. We agreed that it looked and tasted like Valentine's Day. Yum!\n\nI didn't come to Tucson expecting great food, but this really set the bar for local cuisine. Fun, tasty, and didn't feel fatty at all. If I lived in these parts, I would definitely be the duke. Now excuse me while I suppress this urge to shout \"Opa!\" and light every meal on fire.",

  "text": "Wolf Run has the potential to be a really great park on the south east side.  It is easy to find just off Thompson Road and has a paved parking lot near the shelter and playground.  There is a paved walking path oval around the park and basketball courts on the west end, away from the playground.  There is no parking/street access for the courts without hiking or biking, but it offers a distance which keeps older kids from the younger ones.\n\n  The playground has two sets of equipment:  one for bigger kids and smaller equipment for the tykes who might not be as safe on some of the bigger pieces.  They are conveniently spaced for parents who need to watch both.\n\n  There is a large lawn area for playing athletic games, but very few trees for shade.  Maybe future plantings can be arranged to offer a break when the hot days of summer approach.\n\nReview #676",

The natural light that flows in as if you're sitting outside. Gah, all of it. \n\nYes, it's on the saltier side but the price matches the product. Check out all of the local ingredients they're featuring on the menu like Tinker Coffee, local meats and fresh veggies. A few standout reasons I enjoy The Garden Table - their juice flights (PS: they now offer juice samplings for $3!!!), toast selections and most of all, their soups. Two recent stand outs include the chicken pot pie (mind blowing) and the broccoli soup - much lighter than your average broccoli and cheese soup. Back to the space, it's stunningly located on Mass Ave next door to Bakersfield (an easy walk from the Wholesale District). From the tile to the beautiful bathroom to the wrap around bar, they nailed it with this space. Note that if you're just wanting to nab a container of juice you can stop in and check it out in the front fridge. \n\nOnce it warms up the new patio will be put to use. I'm thinking this will be prime real estate for breakfast cocktails and some of their fun Tinker coffee creations.",

They go beyond your simple six pack of lite beers though, as their selection of craft beers is pretty solid.\n\nOn my most recent trip, I was longing for Troegs Mad Elf. Unfortunately they were sold out but not to despair, there were many other great options. The owner was helpful and patient. I had questions about several different beers and she took the time to pull them from the fridge for my review. After a few minutes of intense deliberation, my husband and I went with the Flying Dog \"Raging Bitch.\" (Don't flag me- I swear, that's the name of the beer we got!)\n\nAs long as they are selling, I'll keep on buying.

  "text": "My wife and I arranged to meet our daughter downtown for lunch at the newly opened restaurant.  Set at the corner of  Market Street and Meridian, the main entrance is found on Market about half a block west of Monument Circle.  For long time Indy residents, you may recognize the former Blocks Department store.  The restaurant only uses a small portion of the once huge department area.  The scale here is much smaller without the opulent decor of the previous tenant.  Upon entering, you see the small dining area and bar.  Additional seating is outside on the expanded sidewalk area.\n\nThere was table side service, but the waitress was also the hostess and worked behind the counter too, so there were some times when it was difficult to find any staff in the dining room if we needed assistance.  We noted the the music was cranked way too loud for the small dining area though I will compliment the staff for making an adjustment suitable to make our dining conversation possible.\n  Despite the small number of staff working, I will say the food was delivered properly and without much delay.  I thought it was seasoned well, but did find that the two dishes ordered with chicken were cooked too long and seemed dry.  I was able to try some of my daughter's shrimp skewer and enjoyed IT.  Not rubbery, just a pleasant bite.\n\nThe prices were higher than most of the downtown options) nd the wait  could be improved to be competitive so that diners aren't pressured to leave just to make it back to work on time.  If  you are downtown within walking distance, I recommend  that option on nice days.  Some street parking was available and some parking garages aren't too far away, but on the day I went the doors to the garages  in the building weren't working.  So allow plenty of time for traffic and finding a spot.\n\nI am glad that a landmark building is finding some continued use.  Hopefully this restaurant will fine-tune some of the items I pointed out and will be successful in drawing customers back o this once popular spot. Review #3963.",

It was mostly pepperoni with a light confetti of what was supposed to be sausage, peppers, mushrooms and onions. The tiny bit of vegetables were raw, and mushroom were non-existent. Wings were good and everything was packed well but the blue cheese sauce was watery. Also I requested a little extra sauce and it wasn't saucy at all! The pizza crust was nice and thin. Delivery was fine\n\n I just wish the pizza wasn't cold and had come as described.

  "text": "I know a couple local magazines have been calling Reeds American Table best restaurant of 2015 and I've been itching to try it out. I went to Reeds with two coworkers using a Seat Me reservation. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was packed! We had to wait about 5-10 but they quickly got us a table ready upstairs. \n\nThe main floor is pretty packed. They don't do the communal table thing, thank god, but you might be dining close to other guests. The upstairs is AMAZING. It feels like you're dining in a fancy living room. It's a tasteful space that sets the mood for any occasion. \n\nFor starters, we shared the breaded cauliflower, fried green beans, and Barbacoa. For my main meal I had their cheeseburger. Don't judge me, I love fancy burgers. The fried green beans and cauliflower were my favorite out of the starters. My main meal was amazing. The meat was juicy/tender and it was served on a nice fresh bun. The fries were served with a decadent aioli that calmed my inner fat kid. \n\nAnd don't worry, they serve craft cocktails. Right now they have a hot toddy drink served with honey and ginger. It's sooooo goood. I hope to recreate it at home soon with some Marker's Mark bourbon. If you're looking for something else, you'll find it. Their drink menu is expansive to say the least. Seriously, it's massive. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly. There was a bit of delay getting our drinks out because the bar was so backed up but that was the only bump in the entire experience. Reeds is already my new place to impress friends looking for a quality meal.",

West Coasters-this is the equivalent of Veggie Grill. Most of their menu items incorporate mock meat, but there are a few fully plant based options as well. Sides include mini salads and sweet potato fries. They also have milkshakes, banana whips, and a few types of lemonade to satisfy your sweet tooth. The girls working were all genuinely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.\n\nI got the Udon Noodle Salad, which was very good. The diced mock chicken was delicious. Pleasantly spicy and bursting with savory flavor, it enhanced every bite of the fresh arugula, daikon, sprouts, carrot, and scallion vegetable medley. The \"Udon\" noodles were not udon-more like straight ramen-and were slightly undercooked, but absorbed the other flavors of the salad nicely. The black bean dressing was too thin, but provided a bit of additional dimension. \n\nThe Carrot Ginger Lemonade was tasty and not overly sweet, but just tasted like regular lemonade. Although slightly orange in color, it contained no ginger or carrot flavors whatsoever. I would come back here if I need a quick meal in this area.",

  "text": "3/17/2017:  I had the opportunity to speak with Ed B., the owner, about my experience after he reached out to me. I explained what had happened and he was receptive and interested. He really seemed to want to learn from the experience in order to provide better service in the future. Because of this, I added a second star. You can see this business has otherwise good reviews, so hopefully this was a fluke. \n\nSo 17 months later, Ed B., the owner, decided to reply to my original review (below). I guess a 2-day, $3k move is too little for Litemovers, even if their Yelp status says \"there is no move too small.\" I have all of my correspondence with them, and while their original estimate was very low, I sent them several others I received to demonstrate it would meet their $1000 minimum estimate threshold. They still would not make the 4 mile, 6 minutes, trip. Look elsewhere. Poor customer service. \n\nI contacted Litemovers  based on  a positive recommendation from a friend. I did not end up using this company for my move because of their terrible customer service and refusal to do an in home estimate. Every other mover I contacted was more than willing to do an in home estimate. I literally live four miles from their office. I was in touch with them several times, and always got the runaround. Because of their poor customer service, I cannot recommend this company.",

  "text": "Great little stop just off The Fairway in Jenkintown! A menu filled with an array of salads (both prepared i.e. chicken, tuna, egg, shrimp and veggie fresh), sammies, soups, burgers, quesadillas, melts, wraps and comfort food staples. There's something for those indulging as well as veg-heads and the calorie conscious alike. The menu is especially adorable as many of the items are named after local neighborhoods and towns. Very cute touch! \n\nI used to stop on for lunch with my mom all of the time when I frequented the area more often and the Boca Raton salad was my go-to. It's grilled romaine with a big portobello atop drizzled with the sweetest, thick balsamic glaze. I loved the warm and cold ingredients together! So good! \n\nMost recently I stopped in for the prepared foods for din. While it all looked enticing and prepared with care, I wound up choosing grilled salmon which came with creamy tangy honey mustard and a big 'ol hunk of baked mac n cheese for hubs. He loved both but raved about the mac which he said was sweet, contained many different cheeses and topped with buttery breadcrumbs! I got the broccoli salad and it was THE best I've ever had! And it's dairy-free!!\n\n Davida the sweet owner was behind the counter helping me decide what to take home and giving me all ingredients in each dish as my family is made up of a bunch of P.I.T.A. Eaters. (Pain in the A**). She also told me exactly how to cook each item I purchased. Great customer service!\n\nThey have a delightful bakery with schneken, cookies, cakes and fresh breads too! Grab and go items like cheese and crackers, crostini and hummus too. \n\nI say it's a really great lunch option when in the area and a perfect spot for delicious prepared foods for din in a pinch!",

Creole House sort of looks like a diner inside. Our server was really nice and asked about the type of cherries they used in their cocktails for me. I ordered an Old Fashioned with bourbon to start. The Old Fashioned was pretty standard. My boyfriend and I ordered the Gulf shrimp & grits, fried alligator, crab cakes, and pecan cobbler (free with Yelp check-in). The food was okay. The fried alligator was mostly breaded so all I could taste was batter. The crab cakes was his and I'm not usually a fan. The shrimp & grits was okay. The shrimp were headless and kind of small. Definitely wasn't what I was expecting. The free dessert was pretty good and I am glad I was able to redeem it. For the most part, it was an okay meal and nothing to write home about. If I were to do it again, I would pass.",

Seriously, nothing gets me hungry like the thought of dinner (or lunch... or brunch...) at Tony's.\n\nI love to swing by during lunch and get the lunch buffet... you're in and out really fast, and the food does not disappoint. The buffet includes a signature chicken item, two homemade soups, a variety of pizza and pasta, as well as one specialty item each day (boneless hot wings, BBQ burgers, or toasted ravioli)... AND IT'S $8.99.\n\nDinner is a whole other story! If you're a steak lover, this is where you need to be. The steaks are always perfectly done and topped with a steak butter only the gods of steak themselves know how to create. I was at a business dinner at Tony's once and took a bite of the steak, saying afterwards, \"that was the best thing I've ever had in my mouth!\" I enjoyed the entire rest of my steak, that is after the sting of the accidental and embarrassing innuendo wore off. I swear, you can't take me anywhere.\n\nMy usual way to go is the Hannah's Combo. It comes with a 4 oz. cut of house tenderloin as well as the Chicken Anthony, which is grilled chicken topped with provel cheese and a fresh lemon cream sauce. I also always have to get the white chicken nachos... Tony's is famous for them. I learned how to make them at home, but it's not the same.\n\nAs I predicted, I'm now hungry and it's 11pm. Anyone up for Tony's lunch buffet tomorrow?",

For those people going to/from wine country with Los Olivos, Santa Ynez or Solvang, it is a perfect location. There are plenty of chargers (16 total) with up to the maximum of 250 kW. There are several businesses nearby since it is within the Five Points Shopping Mall parking lot: McDonalds, CVS Pharmacy, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Starbucks, Subway, Blaze Pizza, Luna Grill, T-Mobile, Blenders in the Grass, and Ross Dress for Less.

It really makes you crave a hot cup of tea with other bourgeoisie.\n\nI was stopping in after lunch at Union Loafers with a friend and was already stuffed but couldn't pass up on the opportunity to get something for later. Since the thought of food was a little much, I decided to try something I wouldn't normally get that looks pretty. Great logic, I know. \n\nI went with something that i'm 90% sure they called a  \"Choquette\", although I didn't know that was an actual thing. Maybe it's a signature item of theirs? Not sure. Regardless, it was amazing. I'm more of a chocolate lover but this decadent creamy baked good was legit. It had raspberry cream on top, filled with a really light custard like substance inside, all wrapped in a golden baked bowl. \n\nIt was legit.

There is not really a host so we thought we needed to seat ourselves along with 3-4 other groups behind us, turns out after we are almost seated a person comes over and tells us we need to wait to be seated and apologizes for not being at the door. Ok so about 6-8 people go all the way back to the door, squeeze in and block everyone trying to get out of their booths to leave. \n\nWe are then seated. I ordered a bee's knees, hubs ordered a whiskey flight. It took no joke, around 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. When we did my bees knees was warm and unappetizing. Also it was a little unbalanced for my taste. A simple cocktail like this needs to be properly executed, and it was too sweet, and not tart enough. \n\nWe ordered a chicken biscuit and fries. The chicken biscuit came out at lightning speed. No fries. We assumed they were coming, and then we didn't see out server until my food and drink was finished. She brought the check and there were no fries on it, so instead of even correcting her, we just left. \n\nThe chicken was good, the biscuit was good, but like my favorite chef always says, \"you come for the food, you stay for the service.\" After being almost completely forgotten about, I don't think I will be coming back here to spend my money.",

Once you walk in the door you are greeted by the friendly staff who are quick and kind enough to give you a run down of what they have to offer in the world of bundt cakes.\n\nThey offer 8\" and 10\" cakes, tiered cakes, cute bundtlets, bundtlet towers, and bundtinis that look like cupcakes but they are mini bundt cakes. So cute! \n\nI think this place is going to do just fine here in the 805. The quality and freshness of the bundt cake is amazing! They had samples of the lemon, and let me just tell you it was amazing. I love lemon and this cake was perfectly moist, slightly sweet with that zing of lemon flavor, and the best part of all was the cream cheese frosting! I could actually eat the frosting because it wasn't overly sweet like they tend to be. \n\nI purchased three bundtlet cakes to share with my co-workers. The hard part was choosing the flavors, but I decided on lemon, chocolate turtle, and white chocolate raspberry. My co-workers were very surprised just as I was by how delicious these were, and like me they also agreed the cake and frosting were just right, and again not overly sweet. \n\nShout out to Hashani S. for recommending the white chocolate raspberry flavor! It was delicious.\n\nI will say the hard part about the cake was cutting it up into small slices since the cake was very moist and the frosting was creamy. Aside from that no complaints!\n\nI look forward to going back to try more of their flavors. Definitely check this place out!",

  "text": "Olio e Limone is a small and unassuming \"ristorante\" that serves creative, authentic Italian cuisine rarely found on menus. The lack of decor (the interior is a stark, sterile white with mirrored walls attempting to mask the size of the tiny and somewhat cramped dining room) and abominable service (maddeningly slow, inattentive, and bordering on rude) were more than compensated by the extraordinary dishes we enjoyed. The antipasto was perfect, highlighted by white anchovies and an artichoke heart stuffed with warm goat cheese. The cream of broccoli soup - a special that night - was creamy rich and flavorful. Chicken and artichoke hearts marinated in a zesty dressing were superb. Ravioli stuffed with banana squash, topped with crumbled amaretti and floating in sage sauce, Risotto al Neri di Sepia (black risotto, tinted with squid ink), and Spaghetti a la Bottarga di Trapani (in a sauce composed of olive oil, garlic, chili, and tuna roe) were dishes that both surprised and pleased our palates. For our entrees, we indulged in beef tenderloin (served on thinly sliced fried tomatoes, topped with arugula, parmesan, and white truffle oil), rack of veal, and lamb (with a balsamic vinager reduction), all cooked to perfection. Really too full for dessert, we opted to share two - a heavenly raspberry creme brulee and a rich, dense chocolate and banana bread pudding. A word of advice - don't be shy about asking the prices when the nightly specials are described. A couple of them sounded intriguing, but fortunately before ordering them we discovered they were outrageously priced, considerably higher than the most expensive entrees on the regular menu, and would have increased our tab by nearly $30.00. How \"special\" could they have been to warrant their ridiculous price tags? 5-star food, 3-star ambience, 1-star service.",

We went on Labor Day this year, and despite the crowds of people, we were pleasantly surprised that there were plenty of single and double kayaks available (the early sell outs are paddle boards).  Note that you're going to want to bring you ID with you, as the staff holds onto it and your waiver while you're out on the water.  Neither of us had brought ours this time around, and the staff was flexible with us, holding on to our credit card as a replacement.  \n\nYou're allowed a 10-minute grace period to get onto the water, and then you have the option to kayak for either 1 or 2 hours.  My husband and I always opt for two, and we usually find ourselves paddling to the I-65 bridge and back in about 90 minutes.  You have plenty of time to explore the reservoir and take in the views of the birds and the trees.  It's such a fun way to enjoy a tranquil afternoon on the water.\n\nAt the end of your time, the staff helps you back onto shore so you can pay.  Two hours with two single kayaks cost us $50.  (If that seems steep, renting a double kayak is only $30.)  Until we buy our own kayaks, Eagle Creek Outfitters will always be our reliable go-to option.",

Sorry if that's harsh, it's just that there are some really cutting edge restaurants out there, even in the area nowadays and this kind of pales in comparison.  \n\nThe food is slightly better than average Italian, which if I'm carb-loading, it better be truly fantastic! It's classic Italian fare with a few minor twists here and there. \n \nThe place is tiny and unless you're at a corner round by the front window or outside in nice weather, you're kinda, sorta sitting on everyone else. I have yet to dine at their location across the street, but opening that up was certainly a smart move, logistically. \n\nWait service is good and the BYOB aspect is a plus. Other than that, ehh, I don't know. There are much better places. Much better Italian places. Much better BYOBs. Maybe because I've tried it several times and the trendy aspect of the place is gone?

We actually tried to order from 2 other restaurants before hitting Thanksgiving jackpot with Sher-e! Much like any Thanksgiving meal we were quite stuffed by the time we were done and I definitely needed to nap off all those good eats. \n\nWe shared the mushroom chicken, chicken biriyani, mixed vegetables and some naan. It was all very securely packaged for takeout in a mix of white paper box (Plain basmati rice) and round plastic containers for the curries and biriyani. The naan was wrapped in paper and foil. \n\nI loved the seasonings and spices in each dish. We requested it mild spice and I felt they delivered just the right amount. It was still a little spicy but just a subtle little hint of it in each entree. The white rice was soft and fluffy and while the biriyani was good flavor wise, I thought the rice was just a tad overcooked. The naan itself was a little unevenly cooked as one piece was still a little doughy in the center but had black charred bits in the thinner parts of the bread. Seems like the oven it was cooked in was too hot perhaps? \n\nPortions were plentiful and it was enough to satisfy 2 adults and one toddler with leftovers to spare. If I were craving Indian food, whether on a holiday or not, I feel like Shere-e is a solid choice.",

  "text": "Yes, it's a tourist trap but after I struck up a conversation with the owner, Athena Klimis-Tsardoulias, I found out how much history is at this particular shop and was quite impressed. It started when I asked her if the sponges would always smells like dead fish. Really, if I'm going to wash my body with this thing it can't keep that smell! She assured me that the sponges take on whatever smell you use on them. I think she was around sponges too long (she admitted as much) because she said that to her it smelled like iodine. Some of them were definitely stinky.\n\nShe also explained to me the difference in sponges, how they are harvested, how they grow and reproduce and how to best care for them. She gave me, for free, a pamphlet on sponges. She told me about the history of the building and how they used to have sponge auctions right there in the square. She pointed out pictures on the wall and her grandfather's sponge license. As Matt E. said, the rooms of the shop were used to store sponges. I believe the owner said the building was built in the 1920s. \n\nI ended up buying two wool sponges, which are more expensive, but longer lasting than the yellow sponges. I found two that were $5 cheaper than other sponges their size. When I asked the owner about this she explained that the cheaper ones were perfectly fine, they just had some color variables that made them less desirable. Color didn't matter to me since these were going to be used in the shower. I ended getting two decent sized wool sponges for about $7 each, not a bad deal. I also picked up a bar of Greek olive oil and honey soap. My suggestion is to engage the store owners of Tarpon next time you visit- you never know what you'll learn!",

  "text": "This is a great \"VIP\" section of Citizens Bank park. We sat in the 230 section (given free tickets) and had a perfect view of the field. It was only my second visit to a Phillies game, so it was great to be able to see the big screen so clearly (to learn the players names and positions, and the score, obviously.)\n\nI probably wouldn't spend the $75/ticket, but I'd highly recommend the section for those who can afford it. The bar/air conditioned area is a definite perk. It's also possible to buy chicken fingers and fries for $9.75, which is such a deal at a sporting event where water costs $4.50.",

Their calzones are ridiculous and enough for two meals, but the pizza is even better.\n\nYou know what I like?  Buffalo Chicken and Pizza.  When their powers are combined (as Mellow Mushroom does so nicely) my mouth is so happy that I can hardly contain myself.  I catered Mellow Mushroom in for my team work last week and they all raved about the White Pizza (which I didn't even get a slice of before they devoured it), so I will likely try this one on my next visit to the Shroom.",

  "text": "A true diamond in the rough. I've driven past this strip mall probably dozens of times, and never had an idea that this DELICIOUS restaurant was nestled inside.\n\nThe service is welcoming, friendly, and forthright with complimenting your dinner choices - evidently we ordered really well, according to our waitress!  They were attentive when it matters, but not rushing you out - we dined on a weeknight, so I can't comment if the place is different on a weekend, but we were totally content to sit and chat.  The atmosphere is adorable - intimate and clean lines, copper mugs for drinking, and simple table runners - a perfect spot.  \n\nThe menu is beautiful, plenty of options ranging from simple salads, to pastas, and complex seafood dishes. I jumped at the special of the day, pan seared sea scallop served over a mushroom risotto, with pea puree (I believe?).  The scallops were massive, buttery, and beautifully flavored - and there were 5 of them, WAY too many to eat for dinner .  Hooray for leftovers! \n\nAs you can see from their Yelp page, they're quite known for the arancini - so we dutifully shared an order as a starter.  The arancini of they day was mushroom and ricotta, served over a honey and ricotta mixture.  This was pure bliss.  The honey ricotta was smooth and creamy, the ricotta was fried enough to have a crunch on the outside, giving way to a smooth creamy mushroom filling - best arancini I've ever tasted!\n\nGoing for the hat trick, we decided to share the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  I have to admit, I definitely ate more than my fair share of this dessert - yum yum yum yummmm! \n\n*I went back and forth between 4 and 5 stars, truthfully.  Originally I was going to take off a star for some of the non-food related issues, but once I started thinking about the dishes, and how phenomenal our meal was, it was definitely 5 stars through and through.  There was one glaring issue - unwanted fly dinner guests.  We were seated in a cozy corner, and there was a fly that flitted about our table throughout the entirety of the meal.  This was really annoying, but a simple fix with hidden fly traps somewhere.\n\nBe sure to check out the hours before heading over - this isn't a Saturday night spot, but whenever you do dine here - you'll leave smiling!",

Most of the time I stop by to see Nicole, have my Honey Child, and some of their yummy house made bread but tonight dinner was in order. \nWhile waiting for our drinks Nicole brought us a little lagniappe. It was crunchy bits of fried shrimp on a bed of butter lettuce. The perfect starter. Light and tasty. \nIn addition to amazing drinks the food here is also outstanding. The wood grilled filet with parmesan scalloped potatoes, grilled asparagus, roasted mushrooms, and a creole mustard red wine demi-glace blew me away! Hello! Talk about decadent in a good way. The filet was buttery and cooked to perfection. The sauce was amazing and the potatoes were so flavorful. \nWhen people ask me where they should go for a meal in the French Quarter Muriel's is always on the list. It's a beautiful place to have a meal, the staff are very friendly. Food and drinks are on point and the bartender Nicole is one of the sweetest gals in town.",

  "text": "Vallarta's has been a real hit or miss place for me, so I feel as though I'm rolling the dice every time that I walk through the front door. The food is generally a solid 4 stars, but the service is all over the board.\n\nYou'll find Vallarta's on Anderson Road, next to the AMC Veterans 24 movie theater. The restaurant is located back from the main road, and sitting right next door to a Coldstone Creamery Ice Cream shop. (BRILLIANT!!!!!)\n\nThe menu is diverse, and the food is consistently good. This is much better Mexican than you'll find in many of the smaller joints around town. They bring unlimited chips & salsa with the drinks, but I find their salsa needs a serious slug of hot sauce to give it some personality. Sometimes the chips are fresh from the oven, and other times you can tell that they've been sitting around for a while.\n\nI generally order one of their burrito platters or the carnitas platter. The food is good, although I have found better......but it's hard to beat a quick meal right next door to the movie theater.\n\nVallarta's problem is really their service -- or lack thereof. Sometimes I have a waiter who is sharp and attentive. The order is taken quickly, the food arrives promptly, he refills my drink without asking, and the check shows up without a lot of waiting around.  Other times, you might want to think about walking up to the bar, ordering a few extra drinks, and just waiting.....\n\nToo bad that the service is so spotty. This place could ceratinly be a lot better with some attention to their front of the house!",

I definitely recommend getting a beer flight because then you don't have to choose just one.  Food wise, I had a carnitas pizza once that was amazing.  The meat was so tender and the flavor blended together perfectly.  I also had their poutine (very good, almost Canadian!), gumbo (very good and spicy, the way I like it) and crab cakes (pretty good for a place very far from an ocean)\n\nAlso, you can't go there without having the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  The portion was so huge that the waitress didn't think I could finish it, but I did.  We were both proud of me.\n\nHonestly, this place cares so much about their beer and their food that it's worth flying to St Louis just to go here.",

Issues: Not enough table umbrellas on a hot day, no dogs allowed (really?), and it's on the beach, but has bushes so tall you can't really see the sand.  For sunsets, for sure, yes.\n\nGet in line.  Counter ordering, not full-service, is what causes the long line to be formed.  Allow 30 mins to get thru it.  The menu has a mix of fast foods, sandwiches, salads, and on Sunday - BBQ (I think 11a-3p).\n\nI got an order of the Shrimp Tacos ($9.95) -- grilled tequila-lime shrimp, shredded cabbage, tomato, avocado, cilantro cream sauce, handmade corn tortillas, chips, pico de gallo.  The chips were the best thing on the plate.  The shrimp was just okay (costco?), but mainly the problem was it swimming in the cream sauce.  No bueno.  (2.5 stars)\n\nMy gf ordered the Beach Club Sandwich ($7.50), and had to send it back...so darn greasy.  She got a salad instead, and it was the wrong one and way too simple at that.  Not worth getting back to the counter and waiting again, so she ate it like a good sport.  Again, no service so you are forced to do it yourself.\n\nIf you have small kids and need a break from it all, this is your place.  Overall, I wouldn't come here for the food, or the live band (ma & pa band doing 1970's covers).",

They've done a great job on each item and the prices have all been reasonable. Paying $18 to bring in the waist on a pair of shorts is cheaper than buying a new pair. \n\nThe women working here are super quick, efficient, and have a sarcastic sense of humor that I really appreciate.

The prices are so cheap, it makes me do a double-take every time.\n\nI always go for the Thai egg rolls and the corn cakes as appetizers.  They can't be beat.

And it's the standard that I compare all other pad thai to whenever I have it around the country.\n\nThe only time I've ever had to wait for a table was when a whole dorm of Wash U freshman decided they all wanted to eat Thai food.  Aside from that, there's always room at Thai Country Cafe.  I've turned a bunch of friends on to the delicious food that it brings & they drive in from West County to eat here.

He told me my order would be ready in a moment.

I then finished checking in on Yelp and she was back with my shakes.  Wow! That was some fast carryout.

It was gorgeous sushi style sliced tuna on top of a salad with avocado. The crunchy part was wonton strips. Her husband had the mushroom meatloaf with mashed potatoes in a wild mushroom Marsala sauce. \n\nI had their steakhouse wedge which was huge.

There were ample pieces of tender perfectly grilled sirloin along side. My husband had their small 6 ounce filet mignon steak.

Their wings are good also.  Honestly, all the food here is fine for bar food.  The real reason you come here is for the atmosphere.  \n\nUsually they have two college alumni groups here at the same time.  One is in half of the bar and the other is on the other side.  This makes sure that on weekends this place is packed to almost standing room only on college football (and basketball) weekends.  \n\nParking here can be difficult.  The Beef O' Brady's parking lot fills up really fast and you end up having to park on the street.  Sometimes the Salvation Army opens up its parking lot to patrons.

  "text": "My husband grew up in England and Chatham Tap (both downtown and Fishers) are the spots that most remind him of home. Both locations have English football team jerseys, scarves and posters all over the walls. The dark wood, casual atmosphere and soccer focus bring in a fun and social crowd.\n\nThey have a long beer list of both craft and domestic beers. I snagged a Kona Wave Golden Ale beer and it was delicious. We also got cheese garlic fries and they were seriously addicting. I'd go back for those alone (but probably shouldn't do that allllll the time). The friend we were with claimed that Chatham Tap has the best wings in Indy, so although I didn't try those this time around, I will next time. \n\nOn Saturday and Sunday mornings, there's a big soccer crowd that gathers here to watch games. My husband has made a few friends going to watch games with fellow fans. It's a cool spot!",

  "text": "This is a little bar. It's a divey bar. It's a cheap bar. I like it. Maybe I love it and I don't quite know it.  I'll be honest I've walked past this place many a time, it's was always bustling with activity and busy.  On this fine night, friends and I had a lovely dinner around the corner at Couvant (delicious and fancy).  The night was clearly not over, so instead of heading to the bar at the Eliza Jane(it was quite full with conference peeps) we meandered to the Little Bar.\nIt's a deep little bar and the bar was full of characters on this fine night.  We found ourselves setting up at a table on the side that seem to suite our needs quite well.  We enjoyed local beer and proper bar cocktails.  I'm not sure who chose the music but I could sing along to most all the songs.  A little ruckus happened at the bar and the bartender quickly ejected said varmint and the festivities continued without skipping a beat.  From the varied patrons attire, I assume this is definitely a local for service industry folk whom are ready to slug a few back after their shifts.\nI'll be back for sure and you should give it a go too.  We left a nice tip for the Bartender and I thought he might jump over the bar and give the Pirate a hug.\nYeah we'll be back for certain.",

  "text": "Five stars for the lovely Brittney who made our Bananas Foster this weekend. Yeah, we arrived at 9:15 and even though the doors were locked, we finagled our way inside because the sign out front said they closed at 10pm and Yelp said 10pm but a smile and a \"Please\" and we were shown to a table.\n\nWe'd already had a huge dinner and really, we just wanted this famous dessert at the place that invented it. So that's what we did.\n\nBrittney took our orders, brought over the cart, and whipped up a pair of fresh Bananas Foster. As she did so, she told us the story of the restaurant and the provenance of this particular dessert. It was interesting and fun and even though I have no doubt that she's told the story a million times, it was fresh and fun.\n\nAs for the dessert? It was excellent and delicious and SWEET. This is about as \"not keto\" as you can get and I enjoyed every single bite.\n\n[Review 14062 overall, 1384 of 2020, number 6 in Louisiana.]",

But being that we were in Tucson, we couldn't resist seeing the largest cactus in the world, saguaros.\n\nWe only visited the western section of the park, being that you'll probably find 3x more cactus there than the eastern section, which is more mountainous, and we'd only have a short time in the Tucson area.\n\nMore cactus here than you will ever see anywhere else, some 25 varieties. But the stars of this park are the upwards of some 50' saguaros; and they are only found in the Sonoran desert. And with a lifespan of about 200 years. But they don't even start growing their famous limbs until about the age of 100. Quite a site to see, and fortunately it was the end of November with mild temperatures. Extreme heat during late spring and summer visits will have you wanting to get in and out of the park by 10 AM! \n\nAnother visit to the nation's National Parks checked off of my list.",

  "text": "The Lexington. Hmm. This was many different hotels in the past and it was a Radisson when I made my reservation back in 2015.  Didn't receive any notifications that this hotel had changed ownership. Like many I came to stay here during the 2016 Indy 500 races. \n\nThe Lexington is located near the current airport and very close to the old (now defunct) part of the airport here in Indianapolis. So the million dollar question, would I stay here again? No. The staff were very nice and they tried for the most part. Sometimes they were misinformed about dining hours and generally just overwhelmed. The main phone number to hotel was out a few weeks before our stay and also during our stay. Can't figure out why it would take so long to get one number working. \n\nI think this hotel is close to the end of its useful life. The shower works just okay but the shower heads are a terrible immobile selection, the beds are sort of lumpy to me and the comforter was covered in miscellaneous stains, including some that looked like dried blood. The comforter looked/smelled clean otherwise, but unremovable stains were unnerving. \n\nThe elevators are slow, and most of the lobby looks outdated. Our room air worked okay the first two days then basically stopped being cold at all for the last two days. Despite maintenance coming to look at it twice and claiming a wire needed to be reconnected, it never cooled down. The fan was blowing warm air. \n\nFrom our room the view out the window is of an unidentifiable fiberglass dome that looks like an alien spaceship. Not sure if it was an old pool or something, but it's a view killing eyesore. If you don't believe it, look on google maps to see the \"spaceship dome\" looking image in the middle of the hotel. \n\nOn the last day when I was packing up I realized my perfume was missing from the bathroom counter. I brought only a backpack and minimal toiletries, so I know this item was taken from our room. I reported it the front desk and they acknowledged what I had reported with a head shake. Just FYI for those that plan to stay here in the future. I would have rated this possibly two stars, but after having my perfume taken I'm pretty disappointed. \n\nThe complimentary shuttle was mostly consistent but slow. It did pick us up and take us to the airport after a half hour+ wait. The trip to the airport was very positive.",

I've enjoyed myself every time I've come and even  I wasn't blown away I was always satisfied overall.\n\nFirst off I've only sat outside, so I can't say much for eating indoors. It's hard not to because the courtyard is so cute and inviting. \n\nI enjoyed the breakfast dishes more than I've enjoyed dinner here. I remember ordering a medium ribeye steak that was overcooked to well for dinner. The chimichurri-like sauce helped, but it still didn't make up for the fact that my steak was tough and not a juicy as I would have liked. For breakfast I really enjoyed the Corned Beef Hash Bennie. The hollandaise is on point. The grits topped with cheese was pretty good as well. I ordered a cafe con leche and I have to say I've never had one that came in 3 layers before. It was a good coffee drink, but I can't say it was an authentic 'con leche. LOL.\n\nAll and all I want to come back and try more items. It's in the heart of cute downtown Dunedin, so it's the perfect spot to come to then take a walk around town.",

  "text": "I like Jazzy's.  It's your basic southern hole-in-the-wall smokehouse joint that you'd find tucked away on some rural road, known only to the locals, and cranking out some very good BBQ.\n\nNow in this case, Jazzy's sits along Waters Avenue, one block east of the Veterans Expressway - right at the intersection of Waters & Benjamin Road. It's a little tricky to find the place if you've not been there before, so don't be surprised if you sail right by before figuring out where to turn into the driveway.\n\nLike any good southern smokehouse, you can smell Jazzy's before you actually see the front door. The wood is smoldering away in their barbecue pits, and you'll be able to smell the smoked pork, chicken, beef, sausage and ribs. The sauce is made on the premises; one sweet and mild, the other hot and peppery. Both sauces are the classic combination of butter, minced garlic and hot pepper sauce.\n\nJazzy's is not a white tablecloth kinda place. It's fair to call this rustic, as the dining area is a collection of picnic tables and smaller tables for four. The folks behind the counter are extremely friendly, and you'll be able to watch the kitchen staff chopping up the meats and loading them onto paper plates or into to-go containers; one order at a time - everything is prepared fresh. There's a serving counter in the back with plastic knives, forks, spoons, napkins, and handi-wipes -- and your basic soda machine with Coke products. Place your order, pay for it, and then sit down.....your food will be brought to you.\n\nTonight I had the two meat combo of chopped beef brisket (complete with burnt ends), and a 1/4 smoked chicken. That came with my choice of two sides, and I opted for collard greens and potato salad, along with a fresh piece of cornbread. The collard greens were some of the very best that I've ever eaten, and the cornbread was fresh from the oven goodness. I asked for hot sauce, and Jazzy's did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and had a real nice hot peppery punch. There was enough heat to open up my sinuses, but not burn the taste buds off of my tongue.\n\nThe sides rotate around, and so you won't always find collard greens or potato salad on the menu, but you will find some very authentic southern cooking mixed with some mighty tasty barbecue.",

  "text": "This place is legendary but it's actually very simple. No matter what time of day or night, many people come here to have beignets and coffee while sitting in the large open air covered patio conversing and watching the traffic pass by on Decatur Street. They do have an inside seating area too. \n\nI arrived on a Sunday morning a week ago at 7:15 a.m. for breakfast and had to wait about 30 minutes for them to open. During Covid, evidently they aren't running 24 hours/day like they use too. I saw they close now at 8 p.m.  OMG!!! I have been here at 2 a.m. and had to wait for a table. Also, I noticed that they have transitioned to counter service instead of the traditional table service with the famously dressed servers. Finally another change I noticed is that the prices have gone up. The menu placards have their old prices crossed out with the new prices written in. Oh well, at least they they are still serving food and drink....\n\nYeah, a lot has changed but the beignets taste the same (very good) and are still smothered in powdered sugar. Those babies are IMPOSSIBLE to eat without getting some of that white dust on your clothes and your lips will look like a scene from Scarface testing some of that Bolivian \"nose candy\" afterwards if you aren't careful. Heaven help you if there is any wind blowing. One other thing about the beignets is they are definitely not heart healthy so one order of 3 is enough and maybe enough to share. I don't drink coffee so I have always accompanied my beignets with a large chocolate milk. My order for the beignets and drink was over $7.50 which is double from what it was just a few years ago. \n\nCafe' Du Monde is still a New Orleans institution cherished by both locals and tourists. If you come to New Orleans and especially the Vieux Carre' you have to come here.",

  "text": "It has been my goal to find authentic Peruvian, and it just happens to be located really close to my house! This is something I am very happy about. With it being so conveniently located in Plaza Mariachi strip mall (not in the actual plaza space), it allows me to get my fix on a budget or not anytime I want to. The best part about it? The owner is from right outside of DC in Maryland via Peru. I moved here from DC, and there are a TON of great Peruvian restaurants there, but wasn't sure if I could find me the same quality and authenticity in Nashville. I was happy to see I could.\n\nI live for Peruvian ceviche. It also just happens to be the country's national dish! Ceviche is a seafood dish usually made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices, such as lime or lemon, and chili peppers or other seasonings including salt, cilantro, and chopped onions. If you're into poké, this would be a no brainer for you. The difference are the side items that come with it and the fact that ceviche derives from Latin America. Anyway, the ceviche is legit here!\n\nIf you are looking for something to try Peruvian, but not ready to venture into the land of unfamiliar, try pollo or lomo saltado. I prefer lomo (beef) over the pollo (chicken). Lomo saltado comes with said meat, french fries or potatoes, grilled onion, grilled tomato, sometimes peppers, soy sauce, vinegar, and crema. It is a dish full of hearty flavor, carbs, and starches. Plan to split this if coming here for 2 people. Their portion size could feed a small village.\n\nThese are just a couple of notable items, but if you're looking beyond that - know they have the menu to accommodate. They also have drinks in the fridge to choose from. No alcohol and some fountain fruit juice beverage called chicha morada. This is usually purple and made from purple corn! However, they have a couple of different flavors.\n\nParking is ample and with no problems.\n\nCustomer service was great! They were prompt with the cooking of our meals and took no time to get them out to us. \n\nI really hope you enjoy this family friendly and casual restaurant. It truly is a Nashville gem that should be explored.",

  "text": "GREAT VALUE: $6.95 LUNCH SPECIAL\nLittle Chinatown is my lunch partner's favorite spot for Chinese in Jeff Parish. I have to admit the flavors are clean and not heavy in sauces. See pic - the garlic chicken was cooked perfectly. The onions were carmelized but the celery and peppers remained crisp. The lunch special at $6.95 which includes a spring roll, fried rice and egg drop,soup is a huge meal and one of the best values in the city.\n\nSERVICE IS A MESS THOUGH\nFor some reason today, my standard off-the lunch menu meal was forgotten in the kitchen. Two tables arrived after I ordered and they were both finishing entrées before my soup was served. Next, I was incorrectly charged for an extra soup and tea so that had to be sorted. And they didn't wipe our table clean until after several requests.",

  "text": "This place absolutely needs an updated review, because it has absolutely grown on me. First off, get their fried chicken. You're welcome.\n\nOk, now that you have eaten that, grab pretty much anything else off their expansive menu. The crab omelette, surprisingly delicious...I wanted to hate it because crab and eggs weirded me out, but so good! I've had a few of their sandwiches and burgers now, all better than the first one. Really, I can't say enough about how fresh the food tastes. \n\nThey have amazing baked goods as well! I personally recommend the chocolate cake, it's delicious. \n\nThe servers are very friendly and accommodating, especially now with a little boy that screams and climbs on everything. I appreciate you ladies. \n\nAs for the last star, I can not give a place a full five stars unless they take credit - it is 2018. Yes, I know they have an ATM, but that just means a fee every time I go because I never have cash, which I hate. Also I'm still traumatized about how spicy that buffalo pizza was from a few years back...my nose is still runny. lol",

The wine and beer list is great if you just have time for a drink. \n\nThe best value... Yes, I said value in an airport restaurant is the Izzy plate. 3 shrimp cocktail, Caesar salad, and 2 sliders. I of course have the filet sliders... All for $22! The filet is tender and flavorful. The shrimp will clear your sinuses as H & I believes in horseradish and A LOT of it! Now the wine of my choice is pretty close to the cost of the meal, but HEY a girl has gotta do what a girl must do! Lol! \n\nThe salad menu is great! Caesar and the Wedge are my favs. \n\nThe BBQ chicken pizza is also very tasty! \n\nThank you for giving airport restaurants a good name!",

Honestly, some time could be saved by not trying to suggestive sell me on a higher grade of automobile that defeats the purpose of how I shopped online to book the exact rate I wanted in the first place.\n\nAlso, this location seems to always offer me very few options in my chosen class of car when I walk out to the garage to claim my vehicle. Sometimes, I've actually had no choice at all.\n\nLeaving the garage is always fast and returning here is rather easy as the employees working these areas seem to have a better grasp on being friendly and efficient. On my most recent return here, a manager named Renee handled my return herself and could not have made me feel more appreciated for my business.\n\nI just wish more Alamo employees like Renee were up front to give me a faster check-in experience at this location considering I do use them on a regular basis.",

So it is a South African Portuguese place! Supposedly the main seller here is the Peri-Peri flavour that they use on the foods. \n\nThe place was really cool on the inside! The decor was funky and very green! I love the colour green and it gave the restaurant a bright and trendy vibe. \n\nThey give you a table and number and then you order at the front counter. I'm not really sure why they do it that way? But it seemed to work OK. I got the veggie burger with LOTS of hot sauce. The sauce is flavourful but wasn't as spicy as I thought. BUT DON'T WORRY - there are 4 different hot sauces at every table to make your food better. I also had garlic mashed potatoes which were really yummy. My friend had the chicken livers and he said it was delicious. A lot of my friends actually eat here all the time! \n\nThey cleared our plates right away and then we were out of there. All in all it only took about half an hour, the food comes out quick! So that's always a plus in my books! :)",

The twig still no help.\n\nBy this time, we got our cups and started filling with yogurt and then went to the toppings bar.  The counter was dirty, the cherries were practically empty, the pineapples looked like hell and then (I wish I got a pic of this)....the caramel in the squeeze bottle was so disgusting full of caramel on the outside of the container, I couldn't even touch it to show the guy it needed to be cleaned.  He apologized and then asked the twig to help clean it up.  She took it in the back and apparently washed the top but when it came back to us it had water INSIDE the squeeze bottle!

  "text": "The best part about this diner is that it is very near the airport. So if you need a quick bite before heading to PHL, or you are looking for a good place to wait for someone you are picking up, this would be a great option. You can even get to the airport without getting back on I-95, which is a great plus depending on the time of the day. \n\nThe Philly Diner is obviously a Philadelphia-themed diner. They have a really cool etched glass mural in the dining room that's worth a gander. The diner itself is the kind of art deco mirrored type. Food-wise, it was just OK. My husband didn't like his corned beef sandwich very much, and he was kind of flummoxed when the waitress told him they only had brown mustard. No yellow. I ordered what I always order at diners - two eggs over easy with scrapple. The scrapple was OK. The potatoes were OK. The eggs were really greasy, overcooked and one yolk was busted when they were delivered to the table. They also had those weird stringy bits of fried egg that look like egg celophane are leftover from the grill and should not really be served. Honestly the best thing on the plate was the rye toast. Service was lackluster... we went too long for refills and were told when we requested water that yes we could have one, just as soon as there were some clean glasses available. Really? When we left and went to pay, we asked if we could split the check two ways -- not split up by what we each had -- just literally split it 50-50 down the middle. Apparently, this is difficult. It took three people and about 10 minutes to get that done. Not sure what the difficulty was. But not the best impression. On the plus side, the coffee was good and strong.",

This used to be Brandt's?!\" Soft colors, great lighting, and a bar I wouldn't mind sitting at while sipping some wine.\n\nI need to come back during dinner because I feel like that experience would be even better than lunch... I only have a couple of gripes as far as the atmosphere goes. First, why do restaurant owners let customers eat in complete silence?! I knew going for a late lunch it'd probably be quiet in there, but I just think a little bit of music (instrumental, something, anything) makes the experience seem a little bit better. Second, our server came up and just asked us what we wanted. I feel like with a new restaurant, a short blurb or explanation of the concept is really nice, that way you know what they're going for. Our waitress was lovely, I just would've liked to get the DL on the place before I dove into the menu.\n\nMy eyes always go straight for the cheese plate, so that was up first. It was definitely one of the best ones I've had! To my surprises, all three cheeses were VERY strong instead of at least one being mild, but I loved that. I'm not sure exactly what they were, but one was a bleu cheese drizzled in honey... yes please. It was served with house-made focaccia and met all expectations. For lunch I had the spinach salad, which was extremely simple but in a good kind of way. Accompanied by a dollop (I hate that word) of house-made cheese, pine nuts, and other goodies, I definitely got my dose of phyto-nutrients and it tasted great while doing it.\n\nI will definitely come back for dinner! So glad to have Nico in the neighborhood.",

Coming as a single person, it's hard to find the value in most of the items unless I really, really use something (i.e. hummus and protein powder). \n\nThis place has it all: clothes, alcohol, foods, health/beauty products, and everything in between. It's great if you're planning a large event and want to get bulk in many of the items. However, it's really important to know the competitors' pricing as well. \n\nI eat a TON of peanut butter, so I saw two large things of organic peanut butter for $10. I thought it was a steal, but upon comparing the ounces and prices to where I usually buy, I actually lost money and now I'm stuck with two massive peanut butter jars that I don't have the space for.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to add for vegetarians/vegans: they honestly don't have a ton of options. Not that they have to cater to this specific dietary need/request, but it's becoming very popular to eat plant-based meals. I was surprised at the lack of vegetarian/vegan frozen options that they had upon my browsing of that area. Something I thought I should note.\n\nAgain, it's great for when you're planning to use the items soon or if you have the space.

It is the same plaza that Feet First (running store), Pilot Bank, Massage Studio, Starbucks, Soleil Tanning, and Taco Fusion are all in. \n\nWhen we arrived we were able to park right up front. They have some spots reserved just for Kelp customers. We were also pretty happy to see the outdoor seating because it was a gorgeous day out.

Then I found out that it was actually a chain, so I was a little less excited to check it out, however, I still did want to see what the fuss was about. \n\nChain or not, I was not disappointed at all! There's generally not a lot of variation in the taste of thin-crust pizza, in my opinion...but this was a whole new level of cheesiness. We had half pepperoni and half white pizza. Both were not to be missed.\n\nThe service was extremely friendly and welcoming. He heard us talking about the wings and even brought us out a couple to sample. I will admit, these were not my favorite, but \"everything tastes better when it's free\" is probably the most accurate cliche ever invented.\n\nAnthony's, you done good.",

We were seated quickly and got a huge booth for our whole group, which was fun. We all ordered margaritas and some chips and salsa. The salsa was a bit spicier than I was expecting, and had really good flavor. I liked it a lot! The margaritas however were a bit hit or miss. Mine was not strong at all, but my boyfriend's was super strong. At $14 each for specialty margaritas, I was hoping to get a little more tequila flavor going on! They have pitchers of margaritas which might be a better deal. Our server was super friendly and nice. I would stop in again and try some entrees if I was back in the area.",

You have to go for yourself to decide, I suppose, but what I can tell you is that this nearly $27,000,000,000 restoration project saved a historic Tampa building's life!  The city was shelling out $100,000 a year to keep this place air-conditioned in a fight against mold, and I think they were giving up all hope that someone would buy the thing and do something useful with it.  Props to Starwood Hotels up in Connecticut for heading up this desperately-needed rescue operation.  I mean, I would have done it, but I was about $26,999,990,000 short.  Oh well.\n\nNow, I can't give a 5-star because I haven't stayed a night here, but I plan on it.  Rooms start at around $170 (off season) and can cost as much as $300.  What La Chica and I did do, however, was walk around until people started looking at us like we didn't belong.  The place is really nice.  It's definitely still a courthouse, lots of marble, golden elevators that still smell of a time when smoking indoor was permitted and you just can't miss the Corinthian column pillars out front.\n\nThey have a huge grand opening party on the 28th of this month, and I think anyone who cares about Tampa history should be there!",

SATCO reminded me of the outdoor bars in Houston and Austin and Dallas and San Antonio I used to frequent. Outdoor seating in the shade of trees, buckets of beer, TVs playing the game. \n\nUnfortunately, their food did NOT remind me of home. Least of all San Antonio. The queso, which everyone goes on about, is worse that what I make at home with a block of Velveeta and a can of Rotel (still one of my favorite foods in the world). My fiance got a couple of their beef tacos (store bought tortillas with beef and nothing else - lettuce/tomato/etc. is extra). I got a fish taco. The fish tasted like a frozen fish stick defrosted and deep fried. It was lukewarm. The tortilla was cold. Straight from the package, probably. The food made me sad. :(\n\nBut it's a great place to watch a game! Buckets of beer and TVs. Just wish their queso was a bit more satisfying. Beer + queso + football season = happy camper(s).",

As others mentioned there aren't a ton of options on the menu. I decided on the shoyu ramen and added the mushrooms as well. For the price, I thought the portion was huge... I could have easily taken half home with me. The broth was flavorful especially after I added some extra heat. It could use a little more depth but I think of this as a fast casual option and for that I feel it exceeded expectations. One thing I don't like (even though it's common at most places) is the one giant piece of pork in the bowl. I'm well versed in chopsticks but still have a hard time breaking it up and picking up the whole thing to go barbarian style on it just seems unnecessary. Other than that, I think the ramen was pretty good and was a favorite lunch option compared to others choices in my group.",

Served in a stone bowl with rice on the side, I cooked a raw egg in the light, but filling, soup to add texture. The kitchen go all out with the spices (I requested mine \"Very Spicy\"), but it was SO good I didn't care. (Next to me, my friend was dying - she can handle hot food, so maybe our bowls were switched?) Of the banchan, the cucumbers were a winner.\n\nJong Ja Jip has been recommended to me time and time again and I finally tasted firsthand why.

I finally called the restaurant and the person I talked to said they are out of what I ordered and I'd need to choose something else.

But alas, all the cool, hip places opened up after I graduated, including this one.\n\nIf you're tired of eating healthy food that tastes way too healthy (or like rabbit food or cardboard), look no further. It's hard to figure out what to order because everything is both healthy and delicious.\n\nI settled on the arugula taco salad ($8.50), which had black beans, grilled corn, pico de gallo, tortilla strips and an avocado & cilantro dressing. It was my idea of salad perfection in a bowl, as I love anything with arugula, or avocado, or Mexican-inspired. All the ingredients were fresh and it was just the right amount to feel satisfied after eating.\n\nIf you're looking to unhealthify your salad a little bit, you can order sweet potato fries ($4.50) - quite honestly, these were not as crispy or thin as I like, but still tasty. 3 of us shared one order and they were just okay but nothing to really write home about or crave. \n\nDefinitely get one of the salads - I'd definitely come back next time I'm in town.

Anyway, this particular store was noticeably less, the full priced boots ranged from $80 to 2,000.  Thats a lot better than some stores that expect to be paid $6,000 or more.  They also had some clothes, which I would never wear, but they were $5, $10, and $15 for tee's and jeans.  They also had a sales wall, which included not only cowboy boots, but also heels, wedges, sandals, and leather boots.  They were all consignment though and most of them were not \"lightly used.\" I wound up buying a pair of purple, heeled, faux snake skin \"Moda spana\" boots, for $20 and I checked online its worth about $130 new.  I think thats a good deal... if I can figure out what to wear with them.\n\nSome pointers: yes, this shop is aimed at tourists so feel free to haggle... the employees are ready for it.  Also, if you drive one block up, there's a public parking garage right across from the $10/hour parking lot.  Last thing is that the store is currently in the basement which feels a bit grungy/ shady, but they just bought the entire building and are in the process of renovating the first floor.  They said they were expanding so they could increase their inventory from mostly cowboy boots to other fashion boots and shoes.  And again, their prices are better than most Downtown cowboy boot shops so check it out!  They also have a 3 for 1 deal.",

She waved me into the changing room to make the alterations without any sort of sigh or \"tut tut\" you might get asking for a late favor.  The dress was a double layer of two opposing fabrics; one being a light fabric under a thick lace with sequins adorning it.  She pulled it tighter along the back seam and pinned it without putting any other alteration pins in it besides there. I took off the dress, and paid $32 in cash that I miraculously had on me that day. ((Cash or check only)).  I really don't know the price of alterations, but I felt like this was fine. \n\nI ended up actually picking up the dress early Wednesday morning since I pushed my flight back, and trusted that the alterations had been made correctly. \n\nFour days later I put on the dress right before my sister's wedding and loved how Thumbelina had transformed this beautiful yet frumpy-ish garment into a well-fitting dress that I could feel confident in wearing again. \n\nNotes:\n-They do have weird hours and days off, so make sure to check!\n-Wear the undergarments that you'll be wearing when you wear the altered piece again\n-Bring cash or check\n-Parking behind the building on the grass\n-I would suggest trying on whatever you have altered there just to make sure, but they did a great job on my dress",

The crab and lobster were my favorites, very fresh and lightly seasoned which brought out their natural flavors.  I like shrimp but these are the little ones which were boiled (my least favorite preparation) and were too underdone for me.  Butter was prevalent in every bite, from the bread to the drizzle on top.  The clam chowder was hot and creamy, chocked full of potatoes and a few bits of clam.  For my beverage I chose the Sweet Leaf Tea-brand of black leaf lemonade which was very refreshing and low on sugar.  Highly recommended. \n\nPoppyseed Slaw - Not available.

If that's what you're looking for you're gonna have to walk down to Chinatown or Washington Ave. I'd love to do that too, but it's too far to walk for lunch on a work day.\n\nHere's what it is: a place you can take a coworker that's maybe never had Burmese noodles or a Thai crispy rice salad or Cambodian pork dip that you can be in and out within an hour and pay $12 for a decent amount of food that you can even pack up half of for a snack later or lunch the next day if you have any self control (I don't). The flavors are not too crazy or spicy or authentic but they're better than it's predecessor wokworks or a place like honeygrow. \n\nFood:\n\nThe options are more interesting than your typical Asian fast casual concept, there are herbs and toppings and things you've never heard of, but then there are simple things like a chicken pho (which they call a good deal soup for some reason), peanut noodles, and banh mis. Some of the other options are a curry soup (very good and going to be my go to in the winter), Curry noodles (really liked these), Burmese noodles (liked them at first but then got a bit tired of the flavor- lots of picked things), Thai crispy rice salad (good and actually spicy), Cambodian pork dip (this is an app and was very good, and would be big enough for a meal). The dishes aren't as customizable as wok works or honeygrow where you choose a sauce, topping, veggies and everything, here you just choose a protein ( tofu, seitan, grilled chicken, fried chicken, pork (+$1), and shrimp (+$3)). The fried chicken and grilled chicken are both really good.\n\nThe set up is pretty much the same as wok works was: order at the counter, choose a protein and type of food, they have some sort of rewards system you can link your card to, serve yourself complimentary water and grab your chopsticks/cutlery/napkins/ hot sauce, sit down at tables very close to others, they bring out your food, you bus your own table.\n\nHoping they add some hot noodle dishes for the winter, and looking forward to trying all their options!",

  "text": "There's a little bit of everything here at Fort Harrison: There are multiple playgrounds, a huge hill that is great to sled down when it snows, walking and hiking trails, forest areas to explore, places to barbecue and chill, and creeks to stomp in. This is a park for everybody, and it's a great place to appreciate the outdoors in Indy.\n\nThe last time we visited, it was on a free day, so we didn't have to pay admission. But usually, Fort Harrison requires a fee to enter. So bring yo cash if you want to visit, or get a state park pass, which will allow you to enter via the pass.\n\nWe usually always visit the playgrounds, which are fun but nothing to go out of your way to visit. I certainly wouldn't pay admission just to visit these playgrounds, but if you're here and you have playground-age children, then you must go. \n\nThe last time we were at Fort Harrison, we brought hot dogs and picnic accoutrements, and used one of the grills available to cook out. It was nice because we had our own little spot with two picnic tables and a grill, and it was near the woods, so we hiked into the woods after eating. While in the woods, we discovered some forts made out of tree branches that kids could fit in. Could this be why Fort Harrison is named as such, because there are forts in the park? \n\nI feel like this would be a good park to run through, because there were lots of paved paths that went along the greenspaces and through the woods. I also saw lots of people running while I was there, which confirms my suspicion that this is a good park in which to run.",

Tons of random ethnic food choices, bulk items and a vast variety of produce in the back of the store.  I have been coming to Sanwa for years and it is by far my favorite place to shop for my fruits and veggies.\n\nLet me give you some examples of the current pricing. Fresh herbs are 99 cents, sweet potatoes are 49 cents per pound, 4 heads of green leaf lettuce for $3.99, avocados are 79 cents, 3 lb bags of potatoes are $1.79....I could go on and on and on. Produce is so fresh since it moves very quickly from the shelves. They also carry a huge variety of specialty produce such a many kinds of bok choy, peppers (hot and mild) and many asian veggies that I have never heard of! The meat is very impressive as well, with large cuts costing much less than your local grocers. The extensive supply of ethnic foods up front is overwhelming. Asian, Greek, Indian, etc. I promise you will not be disappointed by the prices here. \n\nParking can be a bit difficult on the weekend. Sanwa is located across from the Fun Lan Drive In movie theater next to the Hillsborough train tracks. Do yourself a favor and check it out.  You will not be disappointed!",

This was close to my hotel and I was pretty hungry and the 3 tender box with fries satisfied my hunger.\n\nThe chicken tenders are a decent size, breaded, and coated in a dry seasoning after they come out of the fryer, so if you're getting some dust on the side, be careful as you may inhale it.  I'd recommend just having them do it instead of putting on the side.\n\nThe heat levels don't seem to be on par with true Nashville heat where Mild will have most people coughing and sucking down liquids after each bite.  I went through 2 #3 level tenders and a #4 level where I was dipping into the powder and I barely had to drink any water.  I'd give the tenders a 4 out of 5 as my only local comparison is Chicken Fire in Orlando which definitely brings the heat.  I rounded up to 5 stars and will probably do a Level 5 if I go back.  (5 is the hottest)",

  "text": "Before reading this review, I kindly ask you to look at the photos below. These photos are words told through pictures that tell why I rated the World Famous Gateway Arch five stars.\n\n  The World Famous Gateway Arch is a 630 foot tall caternary arch that has the distinction of being the \"World's Most Tallest Arch.\" However it's purpose exceeds height records. That purpose is to serve as a monument to the westward expansion of the United States. It opened to the public on June 10, 1967.\n\n   Situated at the site of where St. Louis was established along the west bank of the Mississippi River, the Arch is the highlight of Gateway Arch National Park. The Arch features a below ground museum and elevator ride that ascends to the top. On my 2018 St. Louis vacation, I passed over riding the elevator. That is because when I rode on it in 1997, it was crowded and close defobic. If my experience on it had been remarkable I would have rerode it in 2018 to see the view of the Mississippi River overlooking East St. Louis to the east in Illinois and downtown St. Louis to the west. Instead I preferred to look up at this amazing monument.\n\n   The thing that that strikes me about the Arch is that it is incredible at the same time that it is cute. When you look at the photo below of the Arch on top of the blooming flowers in City Garden, it looks cute. When you look at it with the Old Courthouse from Market Street it also looks cute. From the seats of Busch Stadium it gives a dramatic out of the ballpark grand slam view. Some St. Louis businesses have captured the cuteness of the Arch in drawings and mini Arches. This includes the mini Cardinals Arch at the entrance of the St. Louis Hilton and a picture of the Arch over the Starbuck's Mermaid in the Marriott Starbucks. The closer you get to the Arch the more incredible it becomes. The photos below that I took from Gateway Arch National Park are evidence of how incredible it looks close-up. In my opinion, touring below the Arch from Gateway Arch National Park into downtown was more enjoyable than riding up the elevator.\n\n  Four days short of its 54th Anniversary the Arch that Architect Eero Saarinen created has aged gracefully. Ironically the monument he created that celebrates westward expansion is beside a traffic clogged Interstate system that did too good a job encouraging Westward expansion. I cannot help but think how ironic it is that Westbound Interstates 44, 64, and 70 which played a major role in westward expansion frequently reaches a crawl under traffic gridlock in the shadow of a monument known as the Gateway to the West. \n\n  The Gateway Arch is as good as it gets. It is a \"Must See\" St. Louis Landmark to take in from up close. The photos below are evidence that the Gateway Arch is worthy of 5 Stars.",

I enjoyed just walking around the outside taking pictures.  Second, it's well curated.  So many interesting facts along with historic video of classic country and rock n roll pioneers.  The collection of memorabilia is astounding.\nThird, it's very interactive.  I loved the \"Nashville Cats\" exhibit which talked about Bob Dylan and a lot of the musicians in Nashville.  Listening to musicians and their influences, along with selections from songwriters and session musicians was really an immersive experience.\n\nBest of all, they have the Trans Am from \"Smokey and the Bandit II\".   Makes me want to go date Sally Field, seeing that!\n\nThe Hall of Fame section is great too.  The design is wonderful and it's great to see.\n\nI'm not a huge country music fan but after coming here, I realize Nashville is about more than that.  I think the city inspires creativity and I have a better understanding of why singers, songwriters and musicians from around the world would come here.  Really, really outstanding place.  \n\nPro tip: If you go in the side entrance on 5th Avenue, the ticket line there is usually much smaller than the one in the main lobby facing Demonbreun Street.\n\nOnly reason it's not five stars is that it gets a little crowded and it's hard to see some of the exhibits and some of the interactive stations didn't work.  If you're going to make it interactive, you need to make sure the stuff works.",

I finally made my way around to Tomo Sushi and I honestly expected it to taste like every other sushi place I've been to which isn't a bad thing.\n\nI ordered the Drunken Tiger (8pcs) which had\nSeaweed, sushi rice with vinegar, sesame seeds, and 2pcs shrimp tempura. Not only was the flavor the seaweed and dipping sauce combo delicious, but also filling! these were some big servings of sushi! I normally don;t get full form sushi, but I could barely finish my bubble tea!\nThe crunchy toppings were the real star of the show, even tho they did fall off pretty often, but that's were forks are for. \n\nIt only took about 10 minutes for the food to be done which was enough time to wander into H Mart's variety of stores anyway. \nI really enjoyed it and will keep this spot in mind if I'm ever on a sushi kick in my neighborhood.",

  "text": "A seriously elegant evening at one of the Tampa Bay area's newest restaurants. Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant is both a surprisingly-good winery and a fine-dining establishment located near International Plaza.\n\nYou'll find Cooper's Hawk in the same little shopping plaza as the Kona Grill, Texas de Brazil, and E*Trade, along Boy Scout Road. The three restaurants all offer complimentary valet parking which is a great idea since the available spaces out front fill up very quickly.\n\nYou enter Cooper's Hawk through their beautifully-appointed tasting room, where the staff hands you a complimentary glass of one of their wines and invites you to look around and ask questions while waiting on your reservation. You'll find a large number of options for tasting their white, red, and sweet wines. This is a terrific place to learn about wine, and order a \"tasting\" of 7 or 8 different types of wine to enjoy with a cheese plate or a dessert from the bakery case.\n\nIf you prefer a sit-down dinner you have two options -- the lounge area is more casual with TV screens, and you have the choice of a high-top table, small booth along the back wall, or seating right at the bar. I'm told that you can order the full menu from the lounge.\n\nMy preference is the main dining room where you'll be surrounded by large oak barrels used for aging the wine. The feeling is very much like a private dining area in an exclusive wine cellar, an Cooper's Hawk pulls this off flawlessly.\n\nMy extremely lovely date and I ordered some wine with our dinner - a bottle of the incredible Sangiovese Merlot, and we spent a few moments acting like total wine snobs as we swirled the wine in our glasses and just enjoyed the delicious bouquet.\n\nFor my dinner I started with the highly recommended Crab & Lobster Bisque which is as good as any seafood bisque that I've ever eaten. Bold flavors with big chunks of seafood, and finished with a touch of sherry. To that I added the Cooper's Hawk Farm Grill which was a Bleu Cheese-crusted beef tenderloin medallion, a maple, mustard, and pretzel-crusted pork tenderloin medallion, and a Parmesan-crusted lamb chop. This trio of meats was served with grilled asparagus and the house special mashed potatoes   OINK!!!!!\n\nThe waitress smiled when we declined dessert and coffee, and instead brought us a small plate of assorted chocolate-covered strawberries as a little something. (I think this was my Thank you gift for joining their Red Wine Club which will insure that I continue coming back on a regular basis). Regardless, the dinner was so incredibly perfect.\n\nWhen the bill came I was totally stunned at the price. This was a very high-quality meal of the same caliber as Bern's Steakhouse for considerably less money.\n\nOh yes my friends.......an elegant evening, and we will be back for more!",

She had been there before but it was my first. \n\nWhen we arrived at noon we parked in the private lot. There is also street parking in the area but the private lot is much more convenient. When we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. There were actually only 2 other people dining in the entire restaurant. Because it was lunch time we expected it to be busy but hey, no complaints there. \n\nWe shared 5 small plates total. The food was pretty good but we paid $40 for 2 people for lunch for only 5 small plates that are like tapas. In my opinion it is overpriced. Who wants to spend $20 on lunch?",

  "text": "This Jahan Kabob is the sister ship to a joint by the same name on Oxford Valley Road in Langhorne.  Yeah! That's right. The place tucked into the corner of a craft beer store just behind the Super Wawa.  But, the similarity ends with the name.  \n\nAbdul the owner and chef remembered me from the other place and gave me a smile.  His daughter sat by the register taking orders and making friendlies with the customers.  While waiting in line and perusing the take out menu, I took a look around this brand new Afghani/Middle Eastern establishment.  The bright neon beckoned all who find Morrisville an interesting, if offbeat, destination.  The floors were covered with oriental rug runners giving the space a feel of ethnicity, and in the rear stood a low platform with 6 meditation pillows for the Believers who felt the demand to pray before dining.\n\n Ah Salaam Ahlaikum, my brothers and sisters. \n\nWhen I entered I had intended to pick up and go, but the vibe (and aroma) was so unusual, that I decided to find a table to enjoy my meal right there.  When I reached the front of the line I had not decided what I wanted.  I asked Kadrianne what she recommended.  Abdul heard me, and turned from the grill to answer, \"Chicken Curry is what you want.\" \n\nObediently, I agreed. Sometimes, Kismet takes a hand. \n\nHe was totally right.  A few minutes later a plate full of thick yellow golden gravied Chicken chunks and a large pile of Long Grain \"Dirty\" Rice was placed before me. The flavors came through my nose first almost bringing me to tears. My tongue joined the festival a second later.  It is amazing how different curry tastes around the world, because this was neither Indian, nor Thai curry, but something in between.  Cooler and more subtle than it Indian brothers, and suggesting a tartness that its Thai cousins have mastered.  It was unique and savory; smooth and expressive.  The Rice was wonderfully mildly sweet in contradistinction to the Chicken. It seemed the obvious thing to do was mix them together.  That was a moment to remember as my oral senses rejoiced. \n\nThe green Afghani Tea was a good astringent between shoveling the delectables into my mouth.  The Sesame Cookie at the end of the meal, a kind token of appreciation.  \n\nThe other reviews are on target in 5 Starring Jahan Kabob.  This is a special place that will get even better with time, and become a landmark helping put Morrisville back on the cuisinery map where it belongs.",

We spent about $60 between the two of us, ordering a variety of dishes (charbroiled oysters, New Orleans sampler, fried alligators, and shrimp and grits.) Each of them were about 3 stars or less, especially given the price tag. The only one that tasted fresh and worth it was the fried alligators. The charbroiled oysters were over cooked and slightly hard, the New Orleans sampler came less than lukewarm with not so impressive flavors (and I feel like I can say this because I had over 5 gumbos during our NOLA trip!), and the shrimp and grits came with small shrimps (not prawns as shown in the picture from 2 years ago) and fried grits. So.. Overall, I can't give this place more than 3 stars. There are much better places to dine in New Orleans.",

I cannot say enough great things about it--it revitalized an underutilized location and breathed back life into a city and an area of Tampa. I love that it is a destination of the beautiful RiverWalk expansion and that the area its in is great for outdoor events and enjoyment. Check the website and social media pages for information on events, etc. it is family-friendly and even holds events that cater to children and parents. There are highchairs available in and outside on the patio for diners with little ones. \n\nInside the \"market\" there are several different food and drink vendors. I have enjoyed each and every food outlet I have eaten at. The market concept is awesome because you and your party can get and sample a variety of different food under one roof. Many kudos to the development team of this project. I believe it was just what the city needed! \n\nOn the weekends the parking lots are paid parking at a cost of $5 but you are given a $5 voucher to use inside I believe. \n\nAs of 2018 the Indie Flea Market (a monthly market of local and not-so-local goods held on Sunday) is housed in the event space of Armature Works. I will continue to patronize this premiere location destination in Tampa and love that it is in close proximity and very accessible to many!\n\nI LOVE THIS PLACE!!!",

The menu is mostly seafood with some meat, as well as some American dishes and token vegetarian for any herbivore in the group. Their whole fish is really fresh, and the octopus tender.\n\nMy favorite part of the restuarant is its bakery.  It's busy throughout the day, and a nice spot to stop by for some coffee and baked goods. My favorite is the diples, lightly fried, crunchy rolls of dough, with a light drizzle of honey and a dust of cinnamon.",

Prior to new ownership it was $12.99/person Fri-Sat (even cheaper Sun-Thurs at $9.99). Back then the buffet area did not have a carving station for their meat, instead the advertised special was Sun-Thurs, a 1-lb Prime Rib and Fri-Sat was 1-lb T-Bone Steak. They prepare it for you in their kitchen and the server brings it to your table. Now they have a carving station for prime rib daily (I wasn't impressed with the prime rib, it was a bit tough). Prime Rib and Shrimp Fridays and Saturdays. They have sugar free dessert options on one side. Do not expect The Bacchanal buffet (Caesars Palace in Las Vegas). The buffet itself remains small. But the price is super cheap so you get what you pay for. If you want the real buffet you can try other casinos.\n\nThe dining area was nice with soft lighting and didn't feel like a buffet, more like a casual restaurant (to me, at least). Carlos, our server was very nice, very attentive and always checking on us, he was very fast in clearing our table of used plates and refilling our drinks. The Sands Buffet is located upstairs by taking the escalators from the casino floor. Our dining experience was okay here.\n\nReview #0894",

Prepare to have leftovers, split with friends or leave full.\n\nAlthough a little buggy, I loved the outdoor area. There was a tent so we were able to eat outside without baking on the sun; there were tables not covered if you do need some rays. The outdoor section is a fenced in backyard so there's some privacy from the neighborhood.\n\nNow that I've been introduced to Interstate, I look forward to keeping an eye on their beer menu and the creative dishes they can prepare gator.",

  "text": "Vintage-looking in style, this courthouse dates back to 1929, when there was an architectural movement in Mexico and the U.S. that brought back Baroque influences seen in Spanish colonial-era buildings. Since there was a large earthquake here in 1925, it's no surprise that many structures in Santa Barbara date from the late 1920s and reflect this then-popular Spanish Colonial Revival style.\n\nWhile the gems inside like the Mural Room and the clock tower aren't open to the public at the moment, there's much to appreciate from the outside. The main entrance features a grand archway with a Spanish inscription (there's also equivalent English text off to the side) trumpeting God's creation of the land and man's creation of cities. Ornate figures and an elaborate fountain complete the entry. As you pass through the arch, note elaborate tiled mosaics and a beautiful wooden ceiling. While artistically significant, some of these works might not have stood the test of time, given society's slow but ongoing evolution towards a more enlightened and \"woke\" consciousness.\n\nIt's not just about the building, which remains a working courthouse to this day - go through the archway and you'll discover a vast, beautiful courtyard full of gardens. Even in current circumstances, it's a perfect, large spot for distanced outdoor weddings and events. Thanks to Richie D. for pointing out this local treasure here on Yelp!",

  "text": "Commander's Palace was our first dinner in New Orleans on a  Thursday night. Being extremely hungry from a long day of traveling, we were all super excited about our fancy meal here. I had made an online reservation 2 weeks in advance. We were seated immediately and brought up to the 2nd floor of the restaurant. \n\nI went with the Three Course Offering with the famous Turtle Soup, Ahi Tuna, and Bread Pudding Souffle. I was so excited for the Turtle Soup, but it was wayyyy too salty. Each sip of soup made me want to drink a glass of water. The small pieces of turtle just tasted like chicken. Honestly, nothing special. My Ahi Tuna was good but nothing special. Just a few pieces of seared ahi tuna and some veggies. I was excited for the Bread Pudding Souffle as well, but I was sadly let down. The presentation was alright, and the taste of alcohol overpowered the dessert dish. I tried my friend's Dry Aged Duck and that was well-seasoned and tender. I also tried my friend's Gumbo and it was wayyy too salty. Even more salty than the Turtle Soup. I would say food here is 3/5.\n\nService here was absolutely incredible! Definitely 5/5. I had written that it was my birthday when I was making the reservation. They had balloons tied to the center of my table when we arrived. They also stuck a candle in my dessert. All of our waiters were so sweet! When I was looking for the bathroom, one of the waiters walked me to it. The bathroom was gorgeous and stocked with feminine supplies. Even though I knew service would be incredible here, I was still very impressed! I would come back to Commander's Palace for a special event and try different dishes.",

  "text": "LUNCH AT BLACKFISH (note: may or may not be a holiday season-only thing, so check on OpenTable before you go):\n\nBack in the day, before I moved to Philly, Blackfish used to do lunch.  So I was excited to hear they were starting it up again, and four of us made it in this past Black Friday. As we were the only customers (never happened to me before, since Blackfish is usually packed for dinner), I guess everyone else was out shopping! But we had a great time with the restaurant completely to ourselves, and as always the service was great.\n\nChatted with Leah Patterson, the new Director of Operations for the newly renamed \"Roman Restaurant Group\" (sounds Italian, but that's fine since Chip makes some pretty good pasta!). She used to work at Blackfish \"back in the day\", moved to NYC, and is now back in the fold (her husband John Patterson is CdC at Fork). She told us how excited she was about the brand new websites for Blackfish/Mica/Ela, so check those out.\n\nhttp://blackfishrestaurant.com\n\nWe enjoyed (lunch menu: http://blackfishrestaurant.com/lunch/)...see photos:\n\nFRENCH ONION SOUP--Gruyere cheese, croutons, chives ($8.00)~A big bowl of classic, covered with dripping-down-the-sides toasted cheese...this could be a meal by itself.\n\n'BIG BURB' BURGER--9 ounce Black Angus beef, blue cheese, fried onions, apple wood-smoked bacon, fries, with ketchup and a special sauce on the side ($12.00)...This is the burger that back in the day Craig LaBan listed as one of the best in the Philly area, before my time, but it is still excellent, nice sear, well-seasoned, although I thought it was a bit overdone relative to the medium rare I requested. Excellent fries.\n\nAs good as the burger was, the highlight of the meal was the complementary tasting of truffles, caramels, chocolates, and pate de fruit from Tradestone Confection, Chip Roman's new chocolate shop (next door to Blackfish and not open yet, but you can order them online). Served to us by Fred Ortega (ex-Le Bec Fin), Chip's partner in this new venture.  I had previously ordered some online, so as I already knew, these are KILLER chocolates! The only problem was I was stuffed from that huge burger and soup.\n\nhttp://tradestoneconfections.com\n\n[FYI, I was dining with a couple who have been to Blackfish more than 200 times, so don't get your hopes up that everyone and his uncle gets a free chocolate tasting.  We can only dream. I did ask Harold about whether they were planning to add chocolates to the Blackfish menu, and he said they were thinking about it (and a door between Blackfish and Tradestone is planned). Tradestone, or whatever the actual storefront will be called, will be serving sandwiches, coffee, etc. all day when it finally opens.)\n\nSome wines to go with burgers & chocolate:\n~2007 Pride Mountain Vineyards Merlot\n~1999 Allegrini Amarone della Valpolicella Classico\n\nApparently, depending on how it goes, Blackfish may be doing lunches only for the holiday season, so get in while the getting is good (I'm going to do a couple of work-related holiday lunches there in the next couple of weeks).\n\nAn excellent burger and an affordable way to enjoy Blackfish.\n\nFor my other reviews of Blackfish for dinner, click below...",

  "text": "When I have people visiting from out of town, Midtown is always a fun place to bring them for a night out. We usually do the strip, making Red Door Saloon our last stop. Now I must say, 3 stars is a \"good\" review. 4 is great and 5 is like wow this place is insane. \n\nThe first think you notice when walking up to Red Door Saloon is the lights are literally red. It's kind of a fun concept that makes for some interesting photos. The inside bar section reminds me of a typical dive bar. It's nothing fancy but has a cool vibe. Lots of tables and stools but it gets packed on the weekends so tables fill up fast. There is no live music but they have a decent mix playing. Prices are typical Nashville prices. They have a food menu but I've heard it's pretty bad. I've only gotten the pretzel bites in desperate hunger and they were ok. Nothing special but do the job when you need a snack to hold back the hangry. Whenever we go here, we head straight to the patio area. There is almost always seating back there, it's quieter, and it's the area with the red lights. My one big complaint is the smoking. I get it. It's a divier bar but still. When you don't smoke it can really ruin your experience. We also had one bad experience here with security. My boyfriend bought a beer at the bar. It came in a can and the bartender didn't pop the tab. My boyfriend sat down at the table and a security person came over and snatched it out of his hands. Accused him of bringing in an outside beer, even though our other friends all had the same beers and he just bought the beer a minute ago. He was pretty rude and we finally had the bartender tell him we had bought the beer. I get that it's their job to watch out for outside drinks, but I believe there is a better way to go about it. Especially when were very calm about the situation and not a bunch of drunkards. Just ruined the vibe of the night and didn't make us want to stay for second drink. \n\nOverall, it's a good bar that I will continue to bring visitors to. There is nothing super special about it, but it's a fun stop along the way.",

  "text": "Pure exaltation. It's been nearly a year since I found out about this place (thanks to the stellar reviews here on Yelp), and now -- with a lazy rainy Saturday and in the mood to museum it... we set off to the one museum in Indy we've had on the back burner for so long. \n\nIf you haven't read the reviews already... this is the oldest Pathology building in America. Thanks to it immediately being set off as a Museum when the hospital closed, it's in near-original state -- as near as 97% original (save for a re-caning of the of the chairs in the ampitheatre and a few items shuffled around, it's all there. \n\nWhat's not there? Well, \"The Dead House.\" Bumtown. So the Scheetz family donated their father's creepy basement pediatric office to the Museum so they gutted the dead house, threw up some dry wall, and laid out the office as if it was Scheetz's basement office. What's the dead house? Well, that's there purgatorial ice house where they kept the dead from 1896 to close. Yeah. I know.\n\nThey kept the dead bodies in iron cages padlocked and inside 50 pound blocks of ice. Yeah. I know. You asking the same question: how in the hell did they not keep this in the original state? I don't really foresee them hacking out Scheetz's office unless someone with tons of money donated to the Museum and demanded the dead house be restored (note: they still have the cages in storage). \n\nI could go on & on. I learned so damn much here -- things I love to learn about: architectural intention, intentional architecture, the charted path of historical preservation, the stories of a small group of citizens that banded together with the commitment to the \"Moral Treatment Movement.\" \n\nFor $5 this is a gem. For $20 it'd be a gem, but $5... hokay! \n\nI think we might've been a bit more chatty than most Cathys because our tour took 3 hours. There was one other kind guest from out-of-town... who kindly put up with all of our questions and so-awe struck moments like, \"i love colors,\" and, \"oh! look at that microphotographic camera!\" Seriously, look at that camera... it's glorious. There were quite a few other groups of guests when we were there, which made me happy. I don't want this place going anywhere. \n\nThe big question of the day: because we were in slightly demented rooms of autopsies and cold body fridges, was there some sort of maniacal plan to have our docent sound & talk like Sarah Palin? Seriously, and there was the same glasses, too. And speech patterns: nasal-y voice, stilted tone and a know-it-all docent who even if you answered her esoteric questions correctly... she still attempted to make you feel she was right first. Yep. You had a docent who was Palinian and you're still getting 5 stars. You're gold. \n\nNote: The volunteer/intern who tagged along was totally awesome and thrilled about the history. She was the Joe Biden to her pal Palin. Win.",

Grande is Italian for 'large,' venti means 'twenty,' and trenta is 'thirty'. After a trip to Italy in 1983, founder Howard Schultz became obsessed with its coffee bars and wanted to introduce Italian names. \n\nAs customers demanded larger sizes, 'short' was taken off the menu board so the larger sizes of 'venti' and 'trenta' sizes could be added Tall ended up becoming the smallest sized drink on the printed menu.",

They have everything from prosciutto to smoked cheeses to peppers to olive oils.  Plus, they also have assemble-your-own cannoli components, anise pizelles, and tiramisu (almost as good as Roma Bakery's in Blue Bell).

I came to check out the new place yesterday for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by their upgrade in decor.. They have a great looking bar, modern furniture, a buffet section, and a large sushi bar.. Their restaurant now has a lot of color and design to it compared to the Alvernon location which was drab and run-down looking.. I love their new wall decor but was kind of confused as to why there were 3-4 different types of chairs/tables throughout the restaurant.. I don't know if they were trying to create small pockets of ambiance within each section, or if they just couldn't afford to buy consistent pieces for each room.. I have always been a fan of this restaurant so I was highly anticipating their move to this new building and it's already looking more promising than the past location.. For lunch I ordered 2 Philly rolls and 1 Hamachi nigiri and my bill came to a total of $15.. Everything tasted great but they put a little too much cream cheese in the Philly rolls.. My only complaint about this new location is the layout of their tables makes it quite difficult to walk through the restaurant without bothering other diners, and their whole wait staff is new so it's like a crazy zoo! Maybe after a month or so of being open they will figure out a good system that works for them.. I didn't see any of the old wait staff working just a bunch of fresh new non-Asian faces.. I will be coming back within a month or so to see if they've made any improvements, but for now the food is still great!",

  "text": "'Tis the season for updating reviews. My old review of Eagle Creek was many moons and visits ago. Since then, our visits to this natural oasis have become more frequent. Located only a stone's throw from downtown Indy, Eagle Creek is like having a state park in your backyard yet with urban resources easily accessible. We love the 2-3 mike loop that kicks off at the bird watching center and along the way, we pause to enjoy the scenery, listen to the lull of the waves and enjoy the birds. Simple pleasures, you guys. \n\nInside this park, you'll also find kayaking, cycling, ropes courses and more. They truly offer something for everyone. I'm also super impressed by their daily schedule of educational and active events that fit all age groups and interests. Ah, treat yourself and enjoy some time with Mama Nature.",

  "text": "I have walked through the downtown library several times and hung out on the first floor for a short amount of time. I finally had the opportunity to explore the library a bit and I'm so glad I did. This library is huge and it's beautiful! You can tell it's a beautiful building right when you walk in. The ceilings are high, the floors are marble, and the staircase is grand. The first floor has conference rooms, the checkout counter, and a section of books. It's very quiet, as most libraries are, but this one can get a little busy. However, it still stays quiet. There are three floors total and you will want to explore them all. The second floor has a larger area of books including the fun children's section. I think this is also where the special collection and rare books are kept. My favorite part is the peaceful outside courtyard. I had no idea this was here! There is a fountain in the center and plenty of chairs. There is also some greenery and a nice view. It's the perfect place to get some work done or read a book. The third floor is really cool. It has maps with the history of Nashville painted on the walls. There are also a few statues of historical figures. The third floor is where most of the computers are. I believe there was a huge room full of computers. I just peeked my head in but it looked really nice. My favorite room was a study room (I don't remember the official name). It has really high painted ceilings. It had plenty of light and a decent amount of tables. The walls are lined with books so you just automatically feel smarter when you're in this room. \n\nThe Nashville library system is amazing if you haven't used it yet. All of the libraries are connected which makes it super convenient to borrow and return books. The best part, no late fees! I believe you get the books for 4 weeks so that should be plenty of time to get the books back on time. Like most libraries, you can order books from any library in the Nashville system. They have most of the newest releases but get ready to wait a bit. I have been number 40 on the wait list before. However, sometimes I still get the books in under a month. \n\nIn the words of Arthur (yes, the old tv show from PBS), \"Having fun isn't hard, when you've got a library card!\"",

  "text": "I really liked the location of this gym. It's in a nice looking town center that seems to have a lot of activity going on in it. I would feel safe working out here at night. Based on the other reviews I was expecting this place to be microscopic, but that was not the case at all. This is a decent sized Anytime Fitness that is nowhere near the smallest sized one I have been to. The front of the gym has a collection of the standard machines that you see at almost every location. In the middle is the cardio equipment. I did find it odd that for a gym of this size there are only four treadmills. If you wanted to use one during prime time that could definitely be a problem. There's another room in the back that houses the free weights. There is a squat rack, a smith machine, and a benching station. There is a station for doing seated barbell shoulder presses, which is rare at Anytime Fitness locations. The dumbbells go up to 120 pounds instead of the standard 100 pounds. The fixed weight barbells go up to 110 pounds.\n\nThere is a small room that can be used for classes. I was going to comment that it was nice that there were 3 to 4 spinning cycles in there, until I read the sign that was attached to each of them. The signs stated that the cycles were the personal property of one of the trainers and that they should not be used. Honestly this rubbed me the wrong way. We've all seen signs saying that you shouldn't use equipment that is broken. But to have fully functioning equipment in the gym that I'm not allowed to use? I've never seen that in any of the 20+ locations that I've visited. If I'm paying my monthly dues I should have full access to all of the equipment in the gym period. The locations I've been to in Riverview have lots of cycles available for everyone to use.\n\nI did see several machines that had cracks and splits in the padding on them. The good news is that there are signs throughout the gym stating that a renovation is about to happen (that will not close the gym). Hopefully they will take care of that during the renovation.",

  "text": "Originally a gigantic movie theatre that had opened in 1925 and could seat over 4,000, Powell Symphony Hall reopened in 1968 after an extensive renovation. It became the home of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra with seating for almost 2,700.\n\nThe hall is named after Walter Powell, an executive with the Brown Shoe Company who, with his second wife Helen, enjoyed figure skating. Walter once served as the president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association and was en route to the 1961 world championships when he died in a tragic plane crash that also claimed the lives of the entire U.S. delegation, including competitors, coaches, judges, and officials. When the SLSO needed a new home in the 1960s, Helen came to the rescue, donating $1 million in Walter's honor to help acquire the hall.\n\nThese days, the hall is an architecturally and acoustically rich treasure. In fact, it ranks as one of the finest its kind in the world. I've been to many SLSO concerts over the years and have never had a bad seat from an acoustic perspective, although the hall is sooooooo big that viewing angles can be extreme if you're seated in a far corner. \n\nNot only is the hall itself underrated nationally, but so is the SLSO. I've found the string sections (violin, cello) to be particularly strong. And, of course, not to take away from any other section: the ensemble works beautifully as a whole. Favorite memories include having seen soloist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg bring the house down after just the first movement of the Tchaikovsky violin concerto. Talk about a collaboration with the SLSO that resulted in musical fireworks!\n\nThese days, Powell Hall and the SLSO are anchors of the Grand cultural district. For a city of its size, Saint Louis has some amazing gems that really hold their own on a national and even world scale. It's important to keep them alive.",

The bar and restaurant are separated by a wall that kinda cuts out some of my people watching ability but probably helps me focus more on the peeps I'm with. They also incorporated a plug and USB plugs in the booths on the restaurant side! Drink/food pics fa' days (but please no flash, thanks).\n\nI was in between engagements one night, and decided to belly up to the bar here. I don't often go to bars by myself, and my phone battery was running on low so I couldn't just scroll through Instagram photos of cute puppies for the next hour. Instead of just staring into my delicious Hawaii 504, Hadi was incredibly kind, and talked with me about the bar's unique mural of different idols around the world and how their uniform is part of the owner's personal collection of Hawaiian shirts. What I like about their drinks is while they come out looking like they took 30 minutes to make, they're incredibly fast at concocting them and the staff will still chat away with you while they do their mixology magic. \n\nThe two drinks I've had thus far are the Hawaii 504* with Chinese five-spice suspended in honey and shaken with Virgin Islands rum, ginger liqueur, lime and orange juices and the Paniolo with Kentucky bourbon and Hawaiian macadamia nut liqueur shaken with lime, our own cranberry syrup and a dash of molé bitters. While The Hawaii 504 may still be my favorite with a light ginger and spice kick, but refreshing like a Pimm's Cup; the Paniolo is a great option for someone who's not into rum but wants to hang with the cool kids. In my opinion it's a sweeter, more drinkable cocktail similar to Bourbon Old Fashioned, but not too sweet. \n\nThe chow party happened the other week with only 45'ish minutes to eat. I usually don't put this kind of pressure on French Quarter restaurants but we were able to enjoy drinks, apps, dinner, more drinks and still make our show! We enjoyed the taro chips and steamed pork and chicken? dumplings for starters.  I don't usually get steamed dumplings, but they were fresh, full, handmade, and soaked up the sauce nicely. Loved the kimchi ketchup and sriracha mayo that came with the chips so much we got them with our steak frites. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, and was a good size for my mom and I to split. \n\nFor 5 people, our bill with tip was around $230 with everyone enjoying multiple drinks. I think for the occasion, this was a really fun dinner in a great space with a very knowledgeable and friendly staff. I'd definitely come back with friends to grab drinks and enjoy some of the other dishes or an order of taro chips!",

  "text": "I went to this location for lunch today.  For the future readers of this important yelp it was 20 degrees.  I had the Brunswick stew and the Wet BBQ sandwich.   The Brunswick stew is more like a soup.  It comes in a beef broth with Lima beans corn potato chunks and smoked chicken.  Very tasty.  It has a sweet flavor along with a smoked flavor.  I enjoy this dish and to the best of my knowledge it is the only place in St. Louis that serves this east coast BBQ stew.\n\nThe Wet BBQ sandwich comes on a monster kaiser roll loaded with smoked pork and beef with the BBQ sauce.  Hence the \"wet\" name.  Just an outstanding lunch and a great price.  $6.50 for the sandwich and fries and $3.99 for the stew.  Around the table the other two people both ordered the BBQ rib luncheon special.  These guys knew their way around Bandana's they both asked for center cut ribs.  What that means is the ribs come from the center of the rack and has the most meat.  Nice tip huh?  This special came with 4 ribs and two sides and what looked like a loaf of garlic french bread.  It was under $10.00.  \n\nNow the big comparison between Pappy's and Bandana's.  The ribs they serve at Pappy's are baby back ribs aka loin back.  The ribs they serve at Bandana's are spare ribs cut \"St. Louis Style\".  Spare ribs give you a lot of meat per rib.  Since I did not sample the ribs on this visit I was looking for things I could compare.  Both ribs have a good rub and bark.  Pappy's ribs were fall of the bone style were Bandana's were \"chewy\"  both styles of ribs are acceptable but the \"fall off the bone\" rib is an over done rib.  Not putting that style down it is just how it would be judged at a BBQ contest.  My personal taste is chewy but I think it is a personal choice.  Over all winner.  Well they both got 4 from me.",

Set up much like its sister restaurant, La Teresita, Sabroso was an inviting atmosphere.  The staff was very nice and the food came out quickly.\n\nI went for the Ropa Vieja, which was really good.  The black beans and rice were yummy too.  The price was great, as well.  This spot probably won't become a regular spot for me, just because I don't crave Cuban food very often, but when I do - I will be back!",

  "text": "Preservation Hall is a magical musical place.  I felt like I was transported back in time as the Jazz music flow through the venue.  They are opened nightly at 6pm, 8pm, 9pm and 10pm.  Ticket price varies and costs about twice as much online.  The show I attended was during a week night and online pricing about about $35.  However, you do get a reserved spot on the bench.  I waited inline for half an hour and bought ticket the door for $15.  It's standing room only, but that's great since it's easier to dance.  \n\nThe venue is much smaller than anticipated with 3 rows or bench seating and the rest is standing room.  You can bring in outside beverages since they do not serve alcohol.  There is no restroom, but you can use the ones at Pat O'Brien's next door.  You won't want to leave for the hours or so of music that you'll experience here, so make sure you go before the show.  You can take pictures before the music start but not during.  The music was amazing!!  It was raw and pure and intimate.\n\n....| \\      _  , , , - - , ,  _  ,      \n.../  , ` . - ' ` '             . _   \\ -  ;  ;  ;  , _    \n..| ,  a  -   )   ) _         . ; .

  "text": "I really enjoyed our recent big family brunch at Two Eagles, the newest casual breakfast and lunch spot in Point Breeze. \n\nHubs and I decided to share one of their signature Albanian dishes, the fergese, which is very similar to shashuka. It was perfectly smokey, filled with generous amounts of diced peppers and topped classically with large cheese shavings and a fried egg. It had really great flavor and was accompanied with toast to soak up that deep tomato sauce that was really so delicious! A winning dish for sure! I enjoyed experiencing another region of the world's take on a plate I enjoy so much in places like Israel and Morocco! \n\nThe rest of the fam indulged in breakfast Sammies, creating their own omelets with a variety of fresh ingredients, sweet delicate crepes filled with Nutella, bananas and strawberries, sides of crispy fried potatoes and tender sausage. \n\nWe picked up some fresh OJ and Perrier from the self-serve fridge case, along with ordering various simple cafe offerings like teas (a fruity herbal and English Breakfast black) and Americanos.\n\n Everything was really well liked by all and the prices were astonishing low! MAJOR points for being able to reserved a table for brunch in the city, too! Unheard of these days and I highly recommend doing so if you'll have a larger party like we did, as the corner place is on the smaller side. \n\nThe issue we had here was the wait for our food, which I believe was only for the laborious egg dish from their culture. Next time I would definitely ask for items to be brought out as they're ready and safely assumed I'll be waiting longer when ordering the fregese. You should too, as I noticed others around us who also ordered that dish were waiting. \n\nI would definitely hit up this uber casual spot again, keeping in mind the wait for the fergese, but it was pretty memorable and in my opinion, worth it! \n\nUnmetered street parking.",

It seemed everyone was wrapped in their snuggies at the precise moment when I was wandering the streets, looking for a warm bar to enjoy a neat bourbon. \n\nWhen my mate suggested Misconduct, I gave him a double-take. You mean the bar I've never really thought about patronizing? Since he's a man of fantastic taste, I obliged his suggestion and on we trudged. \n\nI ordered my Maker's, he went with Knob and after the kind bartender informed us of half price burgers, we got one of those too. I'm a total snob when it comes to burgers (there's a bun to meat ratio that needs to be adhered to) and theirs was fantastic. So good that I'd say it's one of the top 5 simple sandwiches I've had in the city. \n\nNext time I'm hanging out with a bar snob of a friend, I'll suggest this place, it's unexpectedly awesome.",

  "text": "I think management of this store saw, read and took to heart the comments of Jessica C in her 13 Jan 2011 Yelp. The assistance and customer service I received on Monday before the Yelp Garden Party was outstanding. \n\nI entered the store knowing I needed a hot glue gun to create my Martini Hat for the Garden Party, but had no idea where to look. The ladies at the service desk were busy, so I stopped an associate who was walking pass me. She admitted she was not sure, but asked me to wait and she'd find out. She quickly asked a coworker in the paint department and came back and informed me it was in aisle 18. I thanked her and then the amazing service kicked in. \n\nAs I thanked her, she informed me she'd lead me to the aisle. (When I worked/trained retail, I taught the importance of leading the consumer, not just pointing) I informed her I was good and thanked her again. When I'm on a mission I move fast. To my surprise, when I got to aisle 18, she was on my heels, making sure I found my glue gun. \n\nI browsed the aisle quickly, an experienced shopper/retailer knows the organization of merchandising and can find an item once in the right area. The associate who followed me, quickly found someone responsible for that area and pin pointed the area just as I did. She smiled and said I just wanted to make sure you found it okay and now I'll know where to find it next time someone ask me. We wished each other good day and I was off to the checkout. \n\nEven with only one item, I never use those self checkout systems. I try to save a job by using a real person. I had a second surprise today, a friendly cashier who enjoyed her job. I was greeted with a smile, exchanged friendly banter and asked to come back again. \n\nI left HD with my glue gun and the bewilderment that I actually shopped a hardware store. Jessica, I hope your next visit has the same top notch customer service.",

To end my last night here we had dinner at the melting pot which was a great choice! The bartender that serviced us was very sweet and sociable. The waitor was attentive and very informative about the menu that was being served that night. We chose the anniversary meal. A four course dinner which entailed St.Louis pizza fondue, salad, a surf and turf along with sausage and buffalo chicken, and lastly turtle fondue for desert. It was basically a two hour dinner experience of cooking our food, and stuffing our stomachs with all the goodness. The conversations was flowing througout dinner along with laughter. By the time desert came I was soo sleepy, but I kept on eating. My sweetie loved everything and his patents had a great time. This was a lovely, romantic and memorable dinner. I'm still smiling about it:)",

I stumbled in and immediately wanted to take on \"Big Al's Challenge\" which consists of eating a \"Big Al Burger\" featuring five beef patties and five slabs of cheese with a side of chili cheese fries or tots. 'Merica! F*ck yeah!\n\nI'm about 6' and 190 pounds of pure salt, sugar, and general apathy. As I was about to order I turned to the side and noticed a man in overalls waiting for his order. This man was shorter than me, but easily was pushing 380 to 400 pounds. He was truly twice my size. And then it hit me. Ding! Ding! Ding!\n\n(Drunken) Archie: Are you Big Al?\n\n(Very) Large Man: Yes. That's me.\n\n(Drunken) Archie: They named a challenge after you. That's so cool!\n\nBig Al: Did it once. Never again, kid.\n\n(Drunken) Archie: I am going to try it. And I am going to add bacon.\n\nBig Al: C'mon, kid. Have fun in Nashville. Don't hurt yourself.\n\nThe way he looked at me with concern you'd think I was attempting to ride a tricycle off a cliff or something. But it made me change my order to a simple bacon cheeseburger with a side of chili cheese tots. Hit the spot. And I couldn't finish. I tapped out with a few bites to go. The \"Big Al's Challenge\" would have destroyed me.\n\nThank you to Paradise Park for (almost) sobering me up. And an extra special thank you to Big Al for saving me from potential internal injuries, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. 'Merica! F*ck yeah!",

I've been excited about the Armature Works for a while and was really happy to get a chance to check it out during a recent downtown Pirate Water Taxi trip.\n\nIt was very crowded, but that didn't take away from it's awesomeness.  The atmosphere is great.  Nestled right on the Hillsborough River, it has gorgeous outdoor scenery.  The inside is super hip and is a foodie's dream.\n\nFrom Ava wood fired pizza, to Ichicoro Ramen, to Cru Cellars wine, to some SCRUMPTIOUS looking BBQ, to an ice cream spot that isn't open but already had me salivating - this place has something for everyone.  The day we visited, we had unfortunately already eaten lunch.  The group ordered some drinks from Graze and I chowed down on a refreshing popsicle from Whatever Pops.\n\nWe sat in the outdoor courtyard in the middle and it was a great place to people watch and listen to music.  I had my 1 and a half year old with me and I wasn't sure how it would go, but it was noisy enough that even a toddler can fit right in.  My plan is to venture back for a date night with my husband and partake in more of the food options.\n\nMy prediction is that Armature Works is going to do extremely well.  Welcome to Tampa!",

Took my little sister (from the Big Brothers Big Sisters program) and we were both happy and pretty impressed!\n\nAll of their salads are fresh and really nicely sized, so order a half size if it's just for you and you just want a little pre-meal grub. The bada-bing is the best IMO, has greens, toasted almonds, gorgonzola cheese, dried bing cherries, and raspberry vinaigrette. For an appetizer, always go with the Pi Bites. Don't ask questions.\n\nI decided to stray away from my usual thick crust, cheesy goodness tonight and go with a thin crust version, and I went with the East Loop- it was a crispy thin pizza crust topped with mozzarella, pesto, roasted chicken, mushrooms and onions. Uhh, yeah.\n\nOur server was great. Pi Bites were taking forever but she acknowledged it from the beginning, which was all I could really ask for. She was attentive and took care of us very well.\n\nLove the inside of this place... don't know why, but it is a more casual atmosphere for me compared to the West End location.

Sunday brunch at 11:00am was no problem and I quickly grabbed a spot for 4 people. \n\nLet's get the bad out of the way first. The blood orange mimosa. Don't get it. It was a tiny glass and I mistakenly thought the blood orange juice would be fresh. It was not. It tasted like blood orange syrup and was a dollar more than a regular mimosa. No thanks. The bloody mary's looked delicious. Go with that or get a different beverage. \n\nHowever... the food was outstanding. The portions were perfect and I highly recommend the vegan dish. It was so flavorful and filled me up without making me miserably full. I also sampled the omelet and it was very good as well. The food is unique and delicious, and not badly priced either! \n\nDefinitely give Actual Brunch a try, just don't get the blood orange mimosa and you'll be happy!",

So she met one of her friends at a cute French restaurant and ate a good meal and lived happily ever after. \n\nOkay so maybe not your typical bedtime fairytale, yet getting transported to another time and place felt part of the experience. I didn't feel like I was on Gallatin Road anymore. I *almost* forgot about the pandemic for long enough to enjoy being outside the house. And for a short period of time I just savored the moment. \n\nAmbiance-\nJ'adore the decor! It was a nice atmosphere although i do wish they had more outdoor seating. In spite of the small space I do feel like the tables were spaced far enough apart to abide by the social distancing guidelines. \n\nFood/Drink-\nThe boeuf bourguinon is what shone the brightest. This comforting beef and onion medley had a rich, indulgent taste and was served over a bed of noodles. \n\nThe peche melba was good but my friend and I weren't as fond about the clafoutis aux cherise. The fresh peach and blueberry desert was nice but the cherry tart was underwhelming perhaps because we didn't know it would be served cold and the custardy middle was not sweet. It could just be our American palates but we could've skipped dessert. \n\nI got a sparkling brut rosé to drink which was very nice and my friend enjoyed her wine as well. \n\nService-\nOur server was nice and attentive. The hostess brought water right away and made sure we were comfortable. And I did hear a few French accents which was nice to know that the people who work here are actually from France as well. \n\nOverall Experience-\nI enjoyed my experience here and would come back. I can't imagine how hard it is for people in the restaurant industry right now so this place deserves some love.",

I think the restaurant could benefit from giving the customer piece of mind by recognizing that the patty is upgraded.  There was no extra frilly toothpick, no different wrapping paper.  Did I get Wagyu? Just something I think would be beneficial.  \n\nPrices seem fair and overall we did enjoy our meal. Would revisit.",

It was a little messy to eat but they provide you with a sharp knife and fork. The buns are made of sushi rice. It's a pretty good size burger.\n\nYes, this is more of a sushi restaurant and today we didn't order any, lol. We always love their food presentation, very pretty and everything is very tasty. We will keep coming back to try their other dishes.",

I was sad to see Reclaimed go, but happy that another creative and fun business took its place. \n\nA few highlights from my visit: \n\n-really appreciate the light walls paired with the big windows - the space is not only inviting but reflects the smells and products sold\n\n-just as many items for males as females (think beer soap, all-natural shaving kits and more). The beer soap smells delicious.\n\n-look forward to giving the cupcake bath bombs a whirl - they'd make for great shower gifts/stocking stuffers\n\n-In addition to the bath & body products, Lilly's boasts a fair share of artwork\n\nBig agreeing nod, Bob.

  "text": "Oh man, I wish I had known about this place earlier. On the advice of Lex, the mixologist at Corsair he suggested I go buy their Triple Smoke whiskey there (they had run out of it there.) I did that and was not only pleasantly surprised with their huge selection of liquors and wines but found that the Triple Smoke was cheaper here than at Corsair, SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. As much as I hate to suggest not buying direct buy here. I bought the Quinoa whiskey at Corsair and found that Midtown also sold that but minus 15-20%. Seriously, for that alone Midtown should be five stars. \n\nThe staff is also equally helpful, both times I was there recently...what's more than buzzed but less than drunk? Whatever it was, I was that. I was still treated well and allowed to do my buzzed+ browsing. The second time I was looking for a special label of bourbon and while it wasn't there, it was available to order but based on the recommendations of the staff member that helped me decided it wasn't for the $200+ price tag. \n\nThe only downside is that the higher level beer that's sold on th eliquor side is actually a little higher than some other places, but I think the liquor prices tend to even that out.",

I'm not a big plant person but I think if you are then you'll love this place. \n\nWHAT: Inside is basically a jungle garden forrest with a man made river running through it. You can take a boat ride on it during business hours and they take a photo of you that you can purchase. I think it's better to see inside during the day. But better to see outside at night especially during the holidays when they have all the Christmas lights decorating the trees outside. \n\nKIDS: Every time I've been here they have some kind of children's exhibit fun activity for them. It's usually during a range of hours though. \n\nEAT: Restaurants are definitely over priced but it is a hotel so that's expected. Ice cream place was yummy. Nice bathrooms. I thought this would be a more happening place at night with the bars, but they were empty. \n\nPARKING: $21 for self parking. Free if up to 20 minutes but I swear their clock tacks on an extra 10 min so you have to pay the fee.",

That accounts for a lot. I'm glad that it's stayed the course and lent some authenticity to the neighborhood. \n\nUnfortunately, for me, I find the hours to be inconvenient to my buying needs (closed on Sunday, only open until 2 on Saturday and closed by 5 on weekdays) and when I can make it in during the week before closing time, I haven't been able to find all of what I need -- requiring a visit to another hardware store. The owners are very nice and the adding machine is quite the conversation piece. For my needs, though, perhaps a trip to CH is best served by an afternoon jaunt during the week for common-sized filters and screws. Working a 9-5, it's just tough to patronize the store.",

Especially since this review is just in time to speak of El Sitio's impeccable food and fine class treatment before you enjoy it during Collingswood Restaurant Week next month!\n\nMeeting up with a bunch of Yelp's finest for an event organized by the Queen of Awesomeness was something that McThrill just couldn't turn down very easily, even if it met entering previously untreaded territory in Jersey (at least doing so led to discovering a better transit system then Septa and plenty of cool reasons to go back!). And entering meant coming across an impressive BYOB and steakhouse that offered up a unique decor, quality service, and delicious food without breaking the bank.\n\nstarters ranged from an eclectic variety of empanadas and ceviche; as well as some calamari that was sheer perfection. with plenty of mouth watering cuts of meat, the majority being grass fed and prepared with a Spanish influence; and a fine selection of seafood to boot; selecting a main course almost became an impossibility. But the Lomo Manchego, a sirloin medallion cooked upon a hot stone and stuffed with manchego cheese, proved to be sheer perfection! throw in fresh desserts like cheesecake and tres leches, and you have an incredible restaurant that's well worth the dining experience.",

Does take-out Chinese EVER cost more than ten dollars?  I think not.   \n\nNext, the food.  Last Friday I defied Lenten mores and ordered the chicken with broccoli.  At $4.50, there is no denying that this is a total deal-- until you taste the chicken.  The uniformly flat pieces seemed suspect, and the taste was not good, no matter how much sauce was soaked through.  The chicken itself was also minimal; the dish would have been more appropriately named, broccoli with chicken.    \n\nEven though I ask every time I call, there is still no option of brown rice; just boring old white or fried.  Surely I can't be the only person who wants brown?\n\nThe \"amazing chicken\" was still tasty the last time I ordered it, and I've always been pretty happy with their wonton soup.  When I'm craving one of these items on my lunch break, Chow's will suffice, but I'll be trekking to Han Dynasty for now on when I really want to get down with some good Chinese.",

  "text": "I'd contemplated raising the Sahm's Place rating a couple of times since my first experience that led to a satisfying yet modest 3-star rating. \n\nBy now, it's no secret that I'm a fan of Sahm's establishments. It's a combination of good, fairly priced food and warm, hospitable service that usually wins me over. \n\nWhile my initial impression of this location at 65th & Keystone was a bit above middle-of-the-road, subsequent visits have proven to be satisfying. While parking continues to be a bit of a challenge in terms of accessibility, \n\nHowever, the real reason I'm bumping up the Sahm's Place rating is simply this - compassion. \n\nI visited Sahm's on Friday evening for dinner with a friend. While I'd been somewhat under the weather, I felt like I was improving and hadn't seen this friend in a couple of months. So, I decided to follow through. \n\nI arrived a few minutes before my friend and ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea. Since I'd been a bit under the weather, I decided a plain hamburger should be fairly safe. \n\nOver the next few minutes, a wave of chills and a serious headache came over me and after a few minutes of my friend's concerned looks, I knew that I needed to leave without having dinner. Since I had already ordered, my friend requested to see our server. Just as she came out, our food arrived. \n\nI explained my situation and simply let her know that I couldn't possibly eat. She asked if I wanted to take the food with me, but I could tell I wasn't going to be eating anything that heavy. I offered to pay the check since the food had arrived and I had ordered it. \n\nShe returned to the kitchen, where I'm assuming she consulted with a manager or supervisor and returned to let me know there would be no charge. I thanked her profusely and quickly left, returned home, and slept for, quite literally, the next 24 hours. \n\nIn a world where the almighty dollar often reigns, it's refreshing to have a restaurant chain that lives into compassionate customer service and valued my business by valuing my welfare. \n\nSo, yeah. My instinct has been to raise Sahm's for quite a while. However, this wonderfully positive experience really motivates me to finally get this update done and I'll definitely be back when I feel better!",

  "text": "September 5th and 6th, 2018 was the inaugural midget dirt track race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. More than a 100 drivers were entered for the DrivenToSaveLivesBC39. The $15,000 winners purse seemed to take a back seat to being the very first dirt track winner at the historical Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The $70,000 overall purse and incentives certainly help with the expenses of driving midgets especially at the national level. Face it, car racing is expensive regardless of the car. \n\nDriven2SaveLivesBC39 was created to honor Brian Clausen, of Noblesville,\nwho died from his injuries during a Kansas Sprint race in August of 2016. His choice to be a registered organ donor saved 5 lives with organ transplants and healed up to 75 people as a tissue donor.  There are currently 115,000 people nationwide waiting for a life saving organ. As a donor recipient I can personally say the daily impact of waiting for that call is unimaginable. It only takes a couple minutes to register to be an organ donor. It saves lifes! On a daily average 22 people pass away waiting on an organ. Please consider registering to become an organ donor and talk with family and friends.\n\nNow, back to the BC39. The IMS discussed building a dirt track 2 years ago and now the dream is reality. IMS built a quarter-mile track inside turn 3 of the IMS.  Over 5,000 fans were there each night to show their support and love of midget dirt track racing.\n\nWednesday night was a beautiful, perfect evening with blue sky and even a double rainbow over the track. With threat of rain in the air, it seemed to surround the IMS but spared the track. It was a night of great racing with the Hot Laps Sessions and Heat Races working up to the Pursuit Race. Pulling the midgets wrecks off the track did pushed each start times back. It was so exciting watching the midgets drift around the corners. I couldn't help but think about the movie Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift. The Pursuit Race was exciting with 24 cars on the short track running hard and fast. Everyone appeared to love the track and the BC39 race.\n\nNight two was a long and dirty night due to the numerous rain delays. Only the Heat Races were run along with the Featured Race.  The B,C,D and E of the main races had to be cancelled since the Heat races didn't start till after 9:00 p.m. One very unexpected but touching vision was Doug Bolles, President of IMS, physically running around the track greeting each driver and wishing them good luck. The stands were packed (5,000 plus), and could have even used more seating, the races were exciting, lots of traffic, entertaining, promoting organ donor registration and I feel the two day event was a huge success. Congratulations Brady Bacon, of Indy, who won the 1st oval dirt track race at IMS around midnight.",

The restaurant is very warm and cozy with dark wood tables and booths plus an attractive, but humongous, chandelier in the main dining area. The bar area is comfortable as well with high and low top tables and several televisions. A small patio is available for outdoor dining weather permitting.\n\nThe menu has several appetizers from pork or chicken tamales, 3 types of cerviche, empandas trio and dips. I love their chips and the salsa is thicker at a mild heat level. The Indiana Street Corn is served on or off the cob and  slow-poached in butter then  smothered in cotija cheese, aioli and sprinkled with tajin spice. Messy if you order on the cob but worth it. One of my other favorites is the Chicken Tortilla Soup with a rich broth and veggies. The Street Tacos are very popular and you can mix and match your favorite 3 fillings out of 14 fillings plus add one side dish. For the unexpected, you'll find dehydrated, real Grasshopper tacos that are high in protein or try the butternut squash or octopus tacos. For those who can't have the traditional corn tortillas try the Taco De Nopal where they substitute a grilled slice of cactus, add steak or chorizo and topped with all the garnishes.\n\nI had the 3 Enchiladas De Mole but substituted shredded pork for the chicken and topped with a generous amount of tasty Mole sauce. My husband had the steak Burrito Fajita with a side of black beans. He really enjoyed the flavor and presentation of the  large burrito with the red and green sauces. He cleaned his plate and even told the Manager how much he enjoyed his meal. As we were leaving he said he'd be happy to return in the future.\n\nOur server was friendly and gave us time to check out the menu. Our food arrived, fresh, hot and timely plus our drinks were refilled.\n\nOn my next trip I'd like to try the Paella or the Red Snapper with saffron rice. So many choices look good it's hard to decide! Lunch was delicious and relaxing.",

  "text": "There are certain things in life for which I now thank Yelp.  This would be one of them.  For a little background, I was in Indianapolis for the NCAA men's basketball tournament games.  Thursday night I was craving cupcakes, but a quick search found nothing open late in the evening (as to be expected in most places).  The craving carried over to Friday when I had a free day and found myself killing a lot of time downtown.  I discovered The Flying Cupcake Bakery on Yelp.  It was about an hour from my location, and I literally knew nothing about where it was... I could've on way to walking through the worst neighborhood in America, but I didn't care. I WANTED A CUPCAKE. Well, Yelp not only got me that cupcake, but on that walk, I was introduced to the wonderful Mass Ave, which resulted in some substantial money spending.  Thanks again, Yelp!\n\nAnyway, on to the actual review!  The Flying Cupcake Bakery is on that adorable Mass Ave.  For a cute street, it would be a cute bakery... and that it is!  A funky, friendly little shop was very welcoming on the Friday afternoon I visited.  Yelp clearly suggested the The Red Velvet Elvis cupcake, but I asked the friendly employee anyway, and she suggested the same.  I sat down in the limited seating and enjoyed my cupcake. The cupcake was delicious, and I inhaled it far too quickly.  As someone else noted, the icing doesn't cover the entire cupcake.  I wish it did, as I am all about my ratios of icing to cake when it comes to cupcake.  However, on the plus side, the cupcakes are not those massive ones with a heaping tower of icing making it impossible to eat.  These cupcakes all looked very eatable... and eating is indeed what I did on that Elvis!\n\nSo thanks, Yelp.  A good cupcake suggestion introduced me to a super cute area as well.  I was a happy girl (and even happier after my Louisville Cardinals won the basketball game that night).",

Oh, goodness, no!! This thing was HUGE!! And it looked so beautiful!\n\nI got the chicken special ($13), which came with a salad, rice pilaf and vegetables: broasted/roasted chicken.

  "text": "The BEST mini donuts in Tampa Bay! I said what I said!!\n\nMy friend sent me a box of Van Dough donuts for my birthday. There was an assortment of their menu flavors: birthday cake, Boston creme, churro, Bacon Me Crazy (maple glaze with bacon bits), Smores, and PB crunch.\n\nThe donuts are dense but not dry. The flavors are delicious and not overly sweet. And since they're all mini, you don't have to feel guilty after you eat a half a box by yourself! \n\nVan Dough also orders custom donuts for special celebrations. Follow their social media to see what designs they offer for holidays. For Father's Day, I ordered the special box and my husband was excited for the unique flavors that day.\n\nThe shop itself is located in the Winn Dixie plaza. There is plenty of parking in the plaza lot. The shop is usually busy in the morning, but the staff brings out orders quickly. There are 25 flavors on the menu, so I suggest browsing the menu before you go to the cashier. \n\nVan Dough has a perfect Yelp rating and for good reason: these mini donuts pack BIG flavor! Get yourself some today!",

  "text": "One of those places that catches you by surprise in a good way!  The room was far bigger and better appointed than I was expecting when I made the reservation.  I was quite happy when I opened the door and saw what would far better be described as a suite instead of a room.  There was a small bar area with a fridge, a big flat-screen TV with a slew of inputs to connect any type of mobile device you may have with you.  Very comfy sectional that may have opened into a sleeper but I didn't check.  Beds were as comfortable as any non-Tempurpedic bed I can recollect.  Sheets were crisp and wonderful.\n\nThe only downside was that the bathroom didn't quite match the rest of the room.  That said, I appreciated the fact that there was a fan - most hotels don't have a fan in the bathroom but it makes it far easier to share a small space.\n\nOne other note - I've had much better Hyatt Place breakfasts at other properties.  Even without a great breakfast this is certainly a place I will stay again if the kid decides to go to Vanderbilt and I find myself visiting Nashville regularly.",

  "text": "This is a cool looking Nawlins bistro that has sidewalk dining and it's located diagonally across from our hotel of choice \"Lafayette\".\n\nThe were busy when we arrived just after 8pm on a Tuesday. The maitre de greeted us with one word \"reservations\". Okay, my response was a one word \"nope\" and there we stood looking eyes. You know what they say \"the one that speaks first loses\" LOL. She spoke after a long moment, not checking a screen or paper but simply with a \"this way\" .... lol I win.  To be fair I was hot, tired and hungry so after driving for 3.5 hours, navigating the nightmare construction traffic in New Orleans, checking into the hotel and trying to adjust to the 800% humidity that is all typical of Nawlins, I wasn't in my normally chipper and fun loving mood :-) \n\nThe interior and the server were just fine but there was this guy who kinda stood around peering around the room was a little odd. First of all he was dressed in a formal black suit and looked like he combed his hair with buttered toast and struck me as a guy badly imitating an Italian used car salesman waiting for a bus. I mean he wasn't talking to the servers, chefs, customers or even fetching napkins, just adjusting his hair and clothes while looking at everyone and no one, like I said odd. \n\nWe were hungry but we were going to turn in early for a 4am wakep to catch a train so we didn't want anything to big or spicy before returning to our room for the night. \n\nWe both got waters and ordered right away. My sweetheart ordered the spring lettuces and fir me I ordered the beef short rib. The spring lettuces was small but okay but OMG the single teeny tiny cube of meat I received was not only comical but was burnt, flavorless and too tough to chew, seriously rediculous. I don't know why my phone failed to record the picture I snapped of that beef dig treat but maybe my phone doesn't have a sense of humor. \n\nWe waited a little too long to get this meager \"meal\" and is was over $30 and as stated I was too tired to put up a fuss and just wanted to get out of there and that's what we did. What a disappointment because I always look forward to a culinary experience when I blow into Nawlins but this was a cruel culinary joke. \n\nBottom line: They staff kinda act like they're a bit overwhelmed, the chef(s) are definetly out of their depth, the food is just plain bad, the portions are small and the prices are high. \nFail",

  "text": "Haru is a spot to watch, starting with their heart in precisely the right place. I've only tried two menu items here, and knowing how this owner operates and improves over time, we will see some great improvements over a short period of time, especially as we all provide them with valuable feedback. \n\nOur community is nearly devoid of Japanese food and Haru is aiming to be the restaurant that brings more of it to us, serving it up in a pretty traditional setting. Japanese food is an exercise in simplicity, preparing fresh ingredients in ways that only serve to enhance the natural flavors, and Haru is no exception. \n\nThe environment at Haru amplifies that message with a bright, airy, and clean dining room focused toward a good sized open kitchen where chefs are preparing bowls of ramen and various yakitori and kushiyaki skewers. \n\nWhen it comes to yakitori, I'm a fiend. Various parts of the chicken are grilled slowly over hot coals with a tare (seasoning sauce) applied during the process. The slow cooking renders the inside juicy while giving the exterior the crispy char and flavor from the grill. Haru does a good job on yakitori, but I found the tare a little sweeter than others I've enjoyed and it didn't have enough of the char that I was looking for in these skewers.\n \nMost of the menu is dedicated to ramen though, which is made from broths that are started from scratch in the kitchen. Tare, a seasoning sauce, is added to the broth to create the base of the dish, on to which  various toppings are layered. \n\nI tried the Haru Shoyu, which is made from a chicken and pork stock with a shoyu (soy) tare is added. This version is topped with enoki mushrooms, pork belly, green onion, fish cake and a soft boiled egg. I noted an aroma similar to dashi when the bowl arrived, and found out the tare was the source with dried bonito added for flavor. For me, this was a bit more prominent than I expected it to be, but it mellowed as the bowl cooled becoming a smoky character in the background. \n\nOverall, as other local food critics have mentioned, the only thing missing in the broth was seasoning. The owner is actively taking in feedback, so I expect the broth will be constantly evolving until it is where he wants it to be. For me, I added some of the vinegar from the house pickled radish I ordered, and a lot of chili oil and shichimi to help it out. \n\nThe soft boiled egg and the noodles were the highlight of the bowl for me. The noodles had the right chew and soaked up a good amount of the broth, while the egg lent a gentle creaminess to the experience. The pork belly wasn't quite what I expected either, with a slightly chewier texture and flavored mostly by smokiness coming from the grill or a torch.\n\nAs many others have reported, Haru has some work to do, but they are doing it! For just staring out, they're doing quite well, and I expect they'll rise to the occasion and really give us a taste of something that has long been missing.",

They were doing a vigorous takeout and delivery business, and you might have better luck ordering in advance. But assuming you aren't expecting anything fancy, this Jamaican place offers cheap and interesting food. They offer an \"Ital plate\"; a shortened form of the word \"vital\" which denotes a Rastafari concept of clean eating. And don't get me wrong, I like New Orleans food, but it is pretty indulgent and I was happy to give this alternative a shot.\n\nThe plate is primarily a callaloo, a red beans and rice dish that tastes quite different from New Orleans style red beans and rice, in this case being rather light and possessing a warm, hearty aroma that smelled like some long-forgotten home. It was accompanied by some fried plantain, braised greens of some sort, and cabbage. Again, not fancy, but it was delicious, a full takeout container for the money, and I felt good after I ate it.\n\nIt's not a vegetarian restaurant, but they have a few other such menu items that I might try.",

It seems they're known for burgers and boozy milk shakes. Boozy milk shakes at a proper whiskey bar? It's juvenile to me! I wanna drink Scotch all night long (hey, that's a song!), the last thing I want to do is drink a milkshake*.\n\nWhile walking to the Farmer (don't forget the Cow) I was sidetracked by huge beer vats. I stopped and had a burger and a beer at the other spot. The beer, well, Merica. But the burger was a waste of time. I start talking to some of the patrons and they're telling those boozy milkshakes are insane. Really? So convincing that I paid the check and RAN out of that stupid place!\n\nWalking inside, it's a serious bar. Dark, with wood floors and a long bar. I'm seeing a great bunch of whiskey choices. A guy greets me at the door, can I help you? I see a bunch of guys sitting at the bar drinking whiskey. I say in a low voice.. I'm here for a boozy milkshake.\nWhat?\nI say in a low voice, milkshake.\nHuh?\n\nMILKSHAKE! I WANT A MILKSHAKE!\n(That didn't happen)\n\nI say, I just ate a burger a few blocks away but I'd like to try one of your famous milkshake please. \nYes sir, right this way.\n\nLots of milkshake choices but I'm seeing little something with peanut butter. And bacon. Now add bacon-infused Redemption Bourbon?? It's called PAUL RUDD. Wait, the guy from Ant Man has a drink?? ok.. well, yes please and thank you.\n\nThe milkshake comes to the table quickly. There is a nice, thick strip of bacon on top. Man... I dove into that sucka like nobody's business! The swirl of the peanut butter and the Redemption Bourbon is making one mighty fine tasty beverage. I took the bacon strip and started dipping it in the milkshake.  Bourbon, Cream, Peanut butter and bacon. At this point, Paul Rudd is party animal!\n\nI paid the check after I finished my shake and walked back to the hotel. Just passing thru Mr Farmer, you totally rocked that milkshake!",

  "text": "If you've ever read my reviews you will know that I have a soft spot in my heart for local wines and wineries. They seem to be proliferating in the NJ/Pa area, and I'm finding it difficult to keep up with all of them. The actual winery that is the parent to this tasting room is about 40 miles away from the PV location. And just one more winery that I was not aware of.\n\nThis room may have escaped my wine-dar too had it not been for the sign that advertised jalapeño wine. It is tucked away in a not prime location, but signs steered us towards it. As we approached we noted a few tables with chairs outside, and some strands of lights framing the entrance.\n\nOnce inside I was happy to see the typical wine tasting room bar, but this one had chairs too. Also a few tables with chairs. I think I prefer this set up over the more common scenario that I usually see which is no chairs. However it can become a more bar type atmosphere with people monopolizing the chairs and not allowing other patrons the opportunity to learn about and taste the wines. On this night it was not a deterrent even though there was one group of drinkers who seemed to be camped out for a considerable time.\n\nGlancing at the menu I noticed 2 things, each individual taste is $1, and the majority of wines were sweet fruit based offerings. But closer inspection revealed there are some dry offerings and even a tawny port( ruby port too) My aunt and I sidled up to the bar and began a small tasting.\n\nTogether we sampled about 5 items, starting with dry whites. The Sauvignon Blanc was ok, the Gewurtztraminer was fair at best. Then a dry red Meritage style that was ok too. Finishing with pumpkin that was very surprising, tart and not too sweet, and it definitely tasted like squash with spice notes. I never had anything like it, and would possibly buy it as unique offering for people to taste with holiday desserts. Last sip was the tawny port that was actually very good, it was a blend of barrels that had been aging since the early 2000's. \n\nThere were several other fruit based wines we would have liked to try, but decided another visit would be the time for that. Sadly their rhubarb wine was not available at this location, but the friendly and knowledgeable server told me if I called ahead he would bring one in. I plan on taking him up on this offer. And I would be remiss if I didn't try the jalapeño on my next visit. I'm very close to being a fan of this wine, and further testing may bump this up to 4 stars. Perhaps the biggest obstacle was the cost, most bottles were $18 or more, and I didn't notice mention of case discounts as other local wineries offer. The Tawny port was about that price but for a 375 ml bottle. Pretty steep IMO. The pours were a decent size, so come here yourself with a friend or two and sample several. 3.75 go local Yelps",

  "text": "For a cheesesteak town, Philly is stacked on great pizza options, and along with Nomad Pizza Company, Zavino is part of a dynamic duo of high quality spots in town. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nA bit in contrast to Nomad Pizza Company, Zavino definitely builds off of their stellar location and opts for a classier, predominantly sit down vibe. They're open late, which is great, and on any given weekday or weekend night you'll find a mix of classy professionals and students looking to get their fix. I got my pizza to go, and it came out in a cool ten to fifteen minutes in the hands of some really nice folks. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nMy 'Joey' pizza was $17.00, which was honestly just about right. While an ambitious Paul could have polished off the whole thing before hating myself passionately, this pie was the perfect size for a normal pair, which balances the price out to a very reasonable $8.50 per person. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nThis was some really, really good pizza. For starters, the crust was fantastically flavorful, which is a rarity these days as everyone unfortunately aims for having the greatest selection of toppings instead of focusing on the basics. As for the toppings, while the spinach was layered on pretty heavy, the pork sausage, garlic and provolone came together brilliantly, and I was ecstatic that the toppings didn't all come sliding off when I took a bite. My one critique was that my crust was ever so slightly overcooked to the point where there were quite a few blackened and flaky bubbles, but that's nothing to gripe over. Dual Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nIt's a close one here, but Nomad Pizza Company also dishes up fantastic pizza, so I can't quite give the fifth star here to either with such strong competition. No Star Granted.",

  "text": "Nashville, I can't keep up with you. Who knew that a Pleasantville-like community popped up behind The Mall at Green Hills. Businesses. Condos. A HOTEL? And Deb Paquette's new venture, etc. Immediately, I think that the universe did her a solid by complicating matters in Sylvan Park and forcing a relocation to Green Hills. This restaurant works so much better in this neighborhood. The area locals will be able to keep it packed (as it was on a Thursday night) and the vibe/POV of the place goes far better in Green Hills than I would imagine it would in Sylvan Park. #thingsworkout\n\netc. is my first Paquette restaurant. I missed the Zola train and I have yet to eat at Etch (many many long stories). Due to the end of the month bringing a hole to our Yelp Nashville team, I thought a celebratory/good-bye dinner at a new Paquette restaurant was just what we needed. I was right. First off, make reservations. As you might imagine, the interest in eating here is high. Valet parking is the name of the game but there was some limited street parking available at night. I can't imagine, though, that it's easy to come by. Valet is complimentary with an expected tip for the porter.\n\nWe were led to a private booth in the back. I quite liked it. It's a two top (I supposed you could squeeze four if all parties were *really* skinny) just off the bar that offered a nice bit of privacy. Just as we were getting settled, Wayne, our waiter, came by to welcome us and introduce us. He was a fantastic server. Not only did he know the menu well, he was a fun conversationalist and added to our dining experience. I would ask for him. Study the menu beforehand but have backups. etc. has already had some stock issues (as a wine I was contemplating was unavailable and the pastrami for the duck breast appetizer was nowhere to be found). Foregoing cocktails (the gin looked surprisingly good), we opted for a bottle of wine. The Melee Grenache was a nice choice (served at a chilly 51 degrees, as it warmed so did my appreciation of it) but overpriced. It was a special occasion and I was expecting a markup but know that a bottle of it will cost you twice what you could get it for at a local wine shop (damn you, beer, for having so many carbs!). \n\nSince we were without the duck breast app, we opted for the scallop crudo. It's a visually stunning plate. Six scallops come atop roasted poblano pepper orange oil and accompanied by black lava salt. For each bite, I'd recommend pairing the protein with the mustard seeds and orange segments. Despite trying to avoid carbs, I couldn't resist the temptation of the watercress tempura (the health cancels out the fried aspect, right?). I'd thought about ordering the tuna but I avoid asparagus like the plague (horrible, horrible vegetable). Instead I went for the lamb. Again, what a pretty plate. My meal came with a healthy portion of medium-to medium-rare (a little bloody for my tastes but I ate it all; perhaps ask for medium-well to get medium?). The meat was above a drizzle of ginger masala and served with pea mint chutney. I tried to avoid the crispy coconut potatoes... but, c'mon. They were made even more decadent/addictive with the smoked date yogurt (which had a thicker consistency than you might think). The okra was an afterthought but props to a grilled, crisp version of the vegetable which is way too often slimy and gross. I fought the temptation to get dessert even though the chocolate panna cotta and grilled pineapple sorbet fought for my love.\n\netc. provided us a lovely evening with good food in a pretty setting. When going out to eat, that's, pretty much, all you need. I'll be curious to see how the menu develops in the future but for an initial effort, it's quite good. Welcome to Nashville.",

We were very disappointed.  As for the food, I ordered the turkey, bacon cheese club sandwich with fries.  It arrived as a single soggy sandwich.  The turkey was watery and tasteless, the lettuce wilted, the bacon tough and not fully cooked and the bread was soggy.  My wife ordered the cornmeal catfish.  It was a generous portion but, half of it was not fully cooked.  Fortunately, the server went back to the kitchen and brought back two orders of catfish with a box and said take these with you and have them for dinner.  That was nice and she earned a nice tip.  However, the worse thing was when I looked up all the vents were coated with a black creasy dust.  Then as I looked around a little more, the whole place was dirty.

  "text": "Costco has everything, they just don't have everything all the time. It's a wholesale club, so all items are not available at all times. They offer items at the best prices, so availability changes. Deal with it and adjust your shopping to save big dollars at check-out. \n\nMy favorite areas are meats, frozen foods, cleaning supplies, toiletries and canned goods. Meats are amazingly high quality.  I can package them with my FoodSaver and save big $'s. I also can save on future meals with selected frozen food and canned goods. I like the frozen salmon and some beef patties. They both make it easy for work lunches and quick dinners. Their canned goods are priced better then shopping at a grocery store with double coupons. \n\nYou can't find better deals on cleaning supplies and toiletries then Costco. For a single person, they'll last forever, or you can share your super savings with your BFF. That way you'll both be clean and be living in a super clean house. \n\nAnother area to always check out while shopping, is the clothes. You'll be surprise at what you'll find. I am amazed at the designers that are periodically available and the prices shock me. You may not be dressed to the 9's, but you'll feel like you are with the savings. \n\nI'll be back? - I'm a member and loyal shopper. \n\nWhen: June 19, 2018\nWhy: I shop twice a month...it's my stock up store.",

We went on a Sunday morning right in between the breakfast and lunch crowd so seating wasn't a problem and sat in the patio area which was cool and gorgeous. Like other locations, service was exceptional and I don't know what their lace their orange juice with but it was gone within three sips. But I couldn't visit and not have their coffee, it's out of this world! I am always sure to buy a bag so I can take home with me and try to make it last for as long as possible. Props to them for selling it on site.\n\nI love the smaller menu they offer here so you aren't in selection overload and  that can get fresh fruit as a side that is actually fresh. I finally tried their Broken Yolk Petite Chou and it lived up to the hype I've been hearing for many years. Mushrooms and Brie make my heart smile and my belly full. I'm tempted to try dinner there during my next visit but am afraid it won't live up to the wonderfulness I had this past visit.",

Get it in the waffle bowl for an extra treat.\n\nOf note, my husband is allergic to milk.  The staff here are all very kind in trying to accomodate him...it is just that the best part about Coldstone is the mix-ins which are lost on him when he can only have one of their dairy-free sorbets.  \n\nI wish it was a little cheaper and better for my waist-line...but I WILL be back!",

I started my plate with the Edamame, Spring rolls and Tempura veg.  All were perfectly done, and I should have stopped there. That was more than enough food for me.  People all around me were talking about the New York Roll and the Miso Soup being delicious. \n\nMy second course was 3 of the tempura shrimp. I wish I'd known that you get 2 shrimp with every order, so I ended up with 6 tempura shrimp, which was too much for me, so I panned that out to others at my table.  (You're not supposed to share, but everyone at the table was doing the AYCE, so we didn't see the problem and neither did our waiter)\n\nThe peppered tuna was ABSOLUTELY to die for. It's the best thing sushi style I've ever put in my mouth. Very steak-y, very yummmm. \n\nMy last thing I ate was their Hibachi steak. This was perfect. The meat was not over done, it was well seasoned and perfectly tender.  Often hibachi meat is over done and dry. Not here. This I would have again and again. \n\nIf it weren't so far away  ( and I see they have a closer location) I would go agan.",

I had previously tried their food at other events a few different times and always enjoyed it, but had never actually made it to the bar. During my visit, they had a DJ playing retro music and the vibe was mellow overall. Really nice.\n\nMy friend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar. She ordered nachos (they were good). I ordered two beers during my time there and each time I did, the bartender questioned me on my choices.\n\nI assume it was because one of the beers was newly-released (Victory's Sour Monkey) and another was a stout and it's hot outside (I like stouts quite a bit and I don't drink by the seasons). She was really hesitant about the Sour Money -- even giving a sample of it first before a full glass. This was nice since I got more of it for the price and that beer is great.\n\nI'd consider returning to Lucky 13 in the future for a casual day and to try more food.",

  "text": "If you're a fan of big bursts of flavors, trying new, unique ingredients and truly inspired dishes, this is your place, whether you're strictly plant based or not! \n\nThe menu is very creative and draws form many different cuisines.... Asian, including Vietnamese, Thai, Korean and Chinese Sichuan, South American and Mediterranean, to name a few. V street is not strictly vegetable based like their sister shop Vedge as there is tempeh, tofu and seitan dishes on the menu. All wonderful though! \n\nThe dishes are shareable and priced pretty reasonably per item. I usually spending quite a bit however as there are just so many delicious options to narrow down so we wind up ordering them all...\n\nDO NOT come here and miss indulging in an order (or two) of Peruvian fries with aji amarillo, cilantro, dried olive, peanuts. So incredible! Definitely a favorite! And worthy of a trip here in and of itself. Not greasy at all. They remain crispy even being covered with magical goodness. \n\nThe Dan Dan noodles are perfectly peanut-ty and filled with meaty mushrooms. Great texture! Not too soupy and filling. They are very spicy however! \n\nThe Korean Tempeh Fried Tacos topped with radish kimchee, tomato, sriracha thousand island are worth a go. 2 to an order. \n\nShishito peppers with togarashi, radish, burnt miso mayo, \"fried rice\" are quite delish and on the light side. This dish wont push you over the edge if you add it. \n\nThe Piri Piri Tofu in \"shakshouka\" sauce, marinated mushrooms and zhoug is very good. I wouldn't necessarily put it high on the list if you're deciding between a few. I feel they have more unique dishes than this to try. The tofu however is perfectly grilled. \n\nSeitan kabobs with fattoush salad, harissa, mint, whipped tahini and cured tofu. Get these over the tofu above of you're looking for a \"meatier\" plate. \n\nThe Cauliflower\" 65\" with whipped dal, mint chutney, and curry hot sauce is fantastic! Easy to pop. Soooo good! Get and order to split. \n\nThe broccoli, the langos...seriously, I can't imagine you being disappointed with anything you order. \n\nThe drinks are pretty wonderful also. Creative and something for everyone's taste. My go-to is 'Cruz Control' which is tequila, horchata and tepache. It makes your feel like you're on an island especially with the little paper umbrella. It's sweet and oeegaps \"girly\", but it certainly has a kick and is less calorie heavy than a beachy cocktail we're all used to. Beers are all vegan and there are definitely a few gems. \n\nYou will also find specials as well as dishes that pay homage to the current season. They use fresh, seasonal ingredients so you will find some slight changes if you come often. They offer brunch and Thai joint is also a great happy hour haunt. \n\nV Street is small and cozy, perfectly located in Rittenhouse Square which makes for a romantic after dinner idea by the way! There's a welcoming bar for chatting and seats by the front window for people watching while you nosh. It's a tad chic, a bit earthy, and even a hair urban with the rainbow graffiti wall. \n\nIt's not the best place for wiggly littles and it's close corners, and definitely not good for car seats etc. Because of the heavily spiced foods, it may not be the first place you would think to bring wee ones however, they were overly accommodating to our girls, separating the spicy sauces and ingredients for a 'build your own' type plate. So, so appreciated! A plus service every time! \n\nV Street, is another absolute home run for Vedge owners Kate Jacoby & Rich Landau. They can really do no wrong in my book. I've been a fan since their humble beginnings back in Willow Grove, then Kater Street. Keep rockin' guys!",

  "text": "Amazing neighborhood liquor store.\n\nI remember a time when I would have to plan a trip to buy bottles of alcohol. Sketchy stores scare me, so large retail wine and spirit shops were my go-to. This would result in twenty-minute trips over to Tampa (forty minutes round trip not counting the time spent in the actual store). It was as if my prayers were answered when this place opened. Also, I considered it supporting a local business, not fueling my alcoholism, which makes it a win-win.\n\nI don't cook. This means that whenever my friends have a get-together, I'm always in charge of bringing a drink. Therefore, at one point during football season, I was buying a handle of [insert gin, tequila, vodka] at least once a month so I could whip up some complex cocktail (we're talking hand squeezing fresh limes and pureeing watermelon. We aren't in college anymore). Even though this isn't the largest store, Feather Sound Liquor Store stocks all my cocktail needs. You won't be getting your mixers here (unless it is basic orange juice), but you'll be able to find all your liquors! \n\nThe people here are super friendly. It really does feel like a neighborhood store. I had to bring wine to a blind wine tasting party - wine is not my forte. The woman who works there (and who is almost always there every time I go), helped me pick out a wine. My wine was deemed the favorite at the party! Additionally, the next time I stopped by, the woman asked me about the party! Customer service at its best.\n\nThis place is clean, bright, and friendly. Shop local and come here!",

This small park is along the Delaware River and next to - of all things - a power plant. It's like industrial surroundings and then - boom - cute local park. When I visited, there were parents with their kids at the playground, and a few couples walking around. There was a dog and his owner playing frisbee. I checked out the view of Camden across the river, and the William Penn statue. You can't turn around in Philadelphia without encountering history, which is pretty cool.  \n\nI drove there with my husband. There is a parking area, but it's small and it was full when we got there.

  "text": "There are a lot of things to like about West Fork Whiskey.  As a business, they are adding to the investment in a neighborhood which had seen its hey day come and go, but is now transitioning into something revitalized with lots of new and remodeled homes on every block.\n\nThey have remodeled their own building and have provided their own lot in the back (street parking is still available, but the streets are quite narrow.)\n\nBeing a distillery, they cannot serve food, but they have a great relationship with Cannonball Brewing across the street and even feature CB's food on a menu.  You can bring your food in as well or have something delivered.\n\nI had read great reviews of the place, and though I am not a whiskey expert, wanted to check it out.  I ordered a flight of three whiskeys so that I could sample the quality of the basic product without depending upon a \"product use specialist\" to influence the taste.  A flight of three shots runs $8 + tax and tip.\n\nThe Colonel is a wheated bourbon and I found it to have a pleasant taste.  All or Nothing is an aged corn whiskey that seemed one dimensional and just not that appealing to me.  3rd Degree was a specialty whiskey infused with cinnamon.  This reminded me of \"red hots\" candy with the rich aroma and heat from the alcohol.  I could see this one being used in all kinds of tasty cocktails.\n\nThe interior of the place was irregularly shaped and has a separate room behind the bar that has a garage door that opens to the outside during nice weather.  During my visit, that room was reserved for a private function, so the surprisingly large number of visitors early on a Saturday afternoon were packed into the front of the bar area which has about a dozen bar stools, and the small public area with a small number of tables.  So, a large number of folks were standing in the walkways between the bar and the tables.  There was a single server behind the bar and he was doing his best to keep up with the flow, but this obviously caused a wait to be served.\n\nIn fairness, most people there seemed to be having a good time.  But I am not a fan of densely crowded places, so I don't go to bars after 8 and I don't show up at restaurants on weekends after 7.  Being retired, I like to sit when I eat or drink and don't like being crowded.  I had to wait for a place at the bar to be cleaned before I could grab a spot. \n\nI wish this place well, but it just doesn't appeal to me.  \n\nReview #686",

  "text": "I used to go to a bar at this location, oh many moons ago, and once saw a professor passed out on the bar. So the location has that bit of nostalgia going for it.\n\nI ordered an iced tea and a egg sandwich. One of the servers was great; the other one seemed to be off in her own universe. I had been seated for about 15-20 minutes when she finally noticed me. Luckily, the on-top-of-it server had already taken my order. \n\nThe space is great if the weather is good. You eat outside under the covering of a 1940s gas station...y'know where the pumps would be. And it's dog friendly which is nice.\n\nBut my food was pretty indifferent. I arrived poorly assembled and with inedible tomatoes\n\nWould I stop in again? Maybe on a beautiful day but just don't expect great food.",

I am so happy they opened this location on the West End so I don't have to drive across town anymore!\n\nThis is the newest of the 4 locations (I am aware of).\n\nThe parking lot is SUPER small... so if you can go during non-peak times you will have a much better time finding a parking spot.\n\nMy favorite score at this location that I haven't found at my previous H&W locations is when they get the smoothies from the grocery store a few days before expiry - I've bought both Boathouse and Arthurs' (Canadian) 100% juice smoothies in the 1 litre bottles for $1.99 and as little as 99 cents when they have 1 day left to expiry.   Last time I picked up 30 bottles when they were 99 cents - came home and threw them in my deep freeze!  Now, I just pull one out - let it thaw in the fridge and enjoy it the next two days!  \n\nJust like the other locations - they have great prices with an ever changing selection!  Just be prepared to eat or freeze the produce within a few days... and understand that they may or may not have the particular item you are looking for when you come.\n\nIf you haven't been there... Give it a try!  You'll be amazed at the savings!",

I would recommend it for anyone looking for Mediterranean food in Brandon.\n\nThe restaurant itself is clean and inviting. I really like the size of this restaurant. My favorite spot is tiny. \n\nAs for the food: I think the falafel is excellent. The fattoush salad is good, the shawarma is good and the kafta kabobs are delish! I'm also fond of the grape leaves. The hummus is good, but a bit heavy on the tahini for my taste. I'm not a fan of their gyro. I think it's the tzatziki sauce that turns me off. I really like cucumber sauce and I can't taste any cucumber in the tzatziki on Grape Leaf's gyro. I need the cooling flavor of cucumber sauce in my gyro or it's not the same. Can I mention cucumber one more time?\n\nI don't recommend the gyro, but I'm a fan of this restaurant.",

  "text": "I am not a lover of 20th Century Malls (dinosaurs), nor most particularly their anchor tenants (dead men walking).  Yet, I found myself in JC Penny in the Oxford Valley Mall recently to exchange shoes that had been purchased online, but arrived the wrong size.  While that might warrant a negative review on its own, the way the folks in the store handled the problem was worthy of praise. \n\nWe came to the shoe department hoping to find the exact shoe we wanted, but their inventory was rather limited.  When we explained to the manager who happened to be at the register what was going on, she promptly accepted our explanation and the shoes and was able to credit our card immediately.  Beyond that, she ordered the shoes we wanted directly at the register, for free delivery within three days.  \n\nSure enough, UPS dropped off the right shoes to our front porch three days later.  They made us happy to have dealt with them.  Even though it would have been better had the right shoes arrived the first time, the way the fix was dealt with was friendly, apologetic and efficient.  And, they threw in an extra $5 discount for our troubles. \n\nI may be the victim of low expectations, but I was pleased by the overall experience. Mistakes can be made by anyone.  It is how they are remedied that tells the tale. \n\nThis experience made me a fan of JC Penny.",

Sometimes there can be a wait especially on the weekends, so just be aware of that. They also have a few other locations around town including two in Goleta and one on De La Vina St. \n\nThey have a parking lot behind because usually it's pretty packed so I always end up doing street parking. Make sure to set a timer on your phone because all of the parking is timed around here. \n\nI have a couple of favorite things that I love to get here!  You have to get the beignets they are SO good! They are small fluffy beignets covered in powdered sugar that are so delicious. I also love the chilaquiles because they are basically breakfast nachos. I also love the rancher's omelet, the veggie benedict, the breakfast sandwich, and the breakfast burritos too!\n\nThey even have really good lunch choices here too! I have had the burger, the tuna met, the french drip, and blt. All of these things have been really good and tasty too. \n\nOverall all of the food has been fresh, delicious, and great! I'm looking forward to coming back here again soon! Thanks Cajun for the amazing time everytime! :)",

In fact, most of my favorite movies have been screened here (and even a few duds, most recently the insufferable \"Rachel Getting Married,\" which actually makes you feel like you were at a dysfunctional wedding for an entire freakin' weekend). But I digress...\n\nI've been spoiled by the megaplexes and their kick-ass stadium seating, and now that I've tasted the sweet, sweet view of sitting up high, going back just doesn't work well for me. That said, as long as you get there early, the views are fine. But do make sure you get there early - sitting up close and leaving with a sprained neck is not cool.\n\nThe bathrooms are clean, the concessions are yummy and there are no crying babies. Except in many of those indie and foreign films I like so much. Crying babies make up most of the cast - and that's why I shell out the benjamins to see them on the big screen. I'm a sucker for a melancholy movie!",

I got some coleslaw (red cabbage and kale) and a Fentiman's Ginger Beer (my favorite) to enjoy alongside.  The cashiers were friendly (even going so far as to make sure that the name on the box was spelled right) and kept the line moving.  \n\nThe Melter Skelter was tasty - crispy on the outside and not too greasy.  The watercress, jalapeno, and crispy chips made for a great combination of texture and flavor.  The chips that come with the sandwich were tangy dill - delicious.  The slaw had some interesting seasoning (cumin? curry?) that made it a little bit different and a great compliment.  The Brielle was also divine - gooier than mine from the brie used.",

  "text": "4.5\n\nPre-lockdown experience.\n\nWhy would I note that I visited a shoe store before things closed down? Because part of the Team Nashville experience is talking with Terry. This man not only knows his shoes and feet, he's a great fellow, a natural conversationalist and someone with whom you want to spend time. That may not be as feasible in these times but the above qualities are part of the reason I (and, I suspect, many others) had such a phenomenal experience.\n\nTowards the end of 2019, I was looking forward to being more active in 2020. To help in that endeavor, I needed new running/gym shoes. The ones I wore were worn out. They worked fine (sorta) for going to the gym but that was the floor basic. I needed something that would engage my foot, support my arches and help keep my cardio reinvention alive. Rather than go to a big box store, I'd read rave reviews about Team Nashville and I wanted to see what the big deal was.\n\nThe big deal is Terry. This man is a magician. He took one look at me, described my gait, activity, my feet, the type of shoes I wore (regularly), my running style, and the type of shoe I would like -- and the type that I needed. HE DID THIS BY LOOKING AT ME! MAGIC. Pure magic. Dumbfounded, I stared at him while he pulled some styles and forms for me. I tried them on and then I went to the parking lot* and ran and walked in them. This was not only for me to get a literal feel for them but for Terry to assess his assumption. Magic. \n\nNeedless to say, I found a pair of shoes that worked for me. I wore them out of the store. As he rang up the sale (very reasonable price), we started talking. 25 minutes later, we were still talking. And we weren't chit-chatting, we were really talking about health, activity, family, aging, food, the city, family, parenting, etc. Terry is not only a shoe whisperer (his athletic prowess is impressive), he's also a counselor. And, as we talked, I felt not one twinge of discomfort thanks to the new shoes I was sporting. 2020 robbed me of some of the gym gains I'd planned, but I wear the shoes for more than just running. Team Nashville changed me from a boot man to a running shoe man -- and I have no regrets.\n\n*Park on the street and take advantage of walking the beautiful Hillsboro sidewalks. It's such an attractive neighborhood.",

  "text": "11/24/17\n\nNo trip to New Orleans is complete without a meal at the Commander's Palace, the quintessential restaurant.\n\nHere, excellence isn't just about food, but really about the entire experience from the moment you walk in the door until you walk out.  The servers attend to you with Southern grace, and every detail of your seating is to create that special ambiance and romance.\n\nI will say that despite their best efforts, there were flaws.  For one, drinks took an eternity to come, and luckily arrived just before the first course.  Our dessert and nightcap drinks also took more than a 1/2hr to come!  And moving on to the food and drinks, clearly some are better than others...\n\n1. Tequila Mockingbird 2 $13 \"an original creation of Commanders... we liked this drink so much we named it twice. tequila and lemoncello combine to create a tart treat you so nice you'll order it twice\":  Refreshing and very tart.  Smooth.  Good tasting though not complex.  7/10\n\n2. Kessler Riesling 6oz $11.50\n\n3. Garlic Bread (complimentary):  Soaked in butter.  Did not skimp on the garlic, and there's tons of spices and cheese.  7/10\n\n4. Cast Iron Seared Redfish Cake $13 \"blackened redfish cake with shaved winter vegetable salad, peppery argula & rum barrel hot sauce aioli\":  Resembles a high-end crab cake, but substituting fish.  Soft, yet many textures including julienned vegetables.  Creamy consistency, with some horseradish. 8/10\n\n5. Turtle Soup $8.50 \"a Commander's classic finished tableside with dry sherry\":  Can't come here and not get this.  Just do it.  No, it is not amazing tasting.  The turtle is really dry for one.  Though, that sherry does add quite a bit of complexity.  Well, just gotta try it.  7/10\n\n6. Caramelized Pumpkin Salad $9.50 \"Covey Rise Farm pumpkins with petite greens, Belgian endive, pecan tuile, brandy soaked grapes with artisan cheese and Satsuma-cane syrup vinaigrette\":  Delicious!  Crisp vegetables against sweet pumpkin and fruit.  Love all the sweet crispy things on top too!  10/10\n\n7. Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish $39 \"a Commander's Palace classic with crushed corn cream, spiced pecans, petite herbs and prosecco poached Louisiana blue crab\":  Well, I'd have to say, it's a ton better than I was expecting.  Often nut crusted fish just ends up with a dry and hard breading.  But in this case, they kept the pecans light, and was not offensive.  The sauce is a bit sweet and very rich.  The fish flesh was pretty good, but was just a tad tough and could stand to be cooked less.  8/10\n\n8. South Louisiana Seafood Stew $36 \"a rich seafood stew of Gulf fish, poached local oysters, wild white shrimp, a popcorn rice boudin cake, with a charred tomato-chili broth and roasted trinity garnish\":  Well, I kinda object to the name--this wasn't a \"stew\" at all.  I mean, I guess they can say the sauce is a stew.  Anyway, the fish is savory with a crisp skin.  Some flavorful mysteries in there too.  Loved how perfectly the oysters were cooked, nearly raw but just enough, and ultra tender.  The oysters paired really well with the rest of the dish.  6/10\n\n9. Sweet Potato Milk Punch $9.50 \"we combine milk and vanilla to a perfect balance of creamy goodness. next, house-made spiced rum spiked with sweet potato is the kick you won't want to miss\":  AWFUL.  Cannot taste of that sweet potato whatsoever.  Tastes pretty much like sugar and milk mixed with alcohol.  Perhaps a super watered-down egg nog?  2/10\n\n10. Limoncello $5\n\n11. Lally's Praline Parfait $8.50 \"hand-crafted vanilla ice cream layered in an old fashioned parfait glass with candied pecans and sticky praline syrup, Lally Brennan's favorite dessert\":  OH GOD... perhaps best sundae I've EVER had!?  So luscious.  That house-made ice cream is decadently luxurious, and paired with the pralines... heavenly!  10/10\n\n12. Commander's Bread Pudding Souffle $9.50 \"all the richness of Creole bread pudding whipped up into a light souffle, finished tableside with warm whiskey cream\":  Hmm, this one is tough.  It's not really a \"souffle.\"  More like bread pudding with meringue on top.  Really mushy bread pudding.  My gf didn't like it.  But personally it worked for me.  It was served really hot, and the sauce clearly had plenty of alcohol.  Most bread puddings are too... bready.  But I think this dessert made good use of the bread.  8/10\n\nSo, there were mishaps, and not everything was the best example of cooking.  But overall, it was a beautiful night at a very special restaurant.\n\n5/5\n\n#neworleans #creolecooking #gardendistrict",

Whatever spice levels you get elsewhere, get 1-3 notches lower here if it's your first time (e.g. if you like Cholula, get light mild).\n2. NO REFUNDS so again be cautious the first time. The spice will last and can affect your entire meal.\n3. Don't throw shade on the bread or ranch. If it's too spicy they'll help you out.\n4. Sometimes drinks can enhance the spice flavor so start with a little.\n\nAs for this spot, the chicken was delicious (even with the spices that caught me off guard the first few bites!). The spaghetti was a tasty side IMO.\n\nThe only con is the bathrooms can get really hot and messy but you'll make do.\n\nOverall I did enjoy this hot chicken and would get it again when visiting Nashville. :)",

It's a small shop that carries retro clothing, mostly women's and a rack of menswear. Everything from t shirts and jeans to dresses and coats. There's even some unique cute jewelry on display in the middle of the store.

  "text": "I think everyone has seen the movie Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. I used to eat White Castle after elementary school as a snack when my mother was lazy and just microwaved a few of them for me and my siblings to hold us over until dinner. I was in St. Louis and it was after midnight and literally NOTHING else was open. This meant that we were making a White Castle run and hoping for the best. It was a BAD decision. The actual place was closed so we had to go through the drive-through line. This is where all our problems started. I don't know WHAT was going on but it took over 15 minutes for us to even PLACE the order and this wasn't because there was a long line. It was ridiculous. \n\nWe tried the Double Cheese Sliders (2 beef patties on a bed of onions, American Cheese, pickles), Chicken Breast Sliders (lightly breaded, crispy chicken breast made with all white meat, American cheese), Chicken Rings (all white-meat chicken breaded) and fries. Everything tasted like cafeteria food. I think only the chicken rings were somewhat passable and that's only after I drowned it in ketchup. As far as the sliders go, stick to beef and avoid the chicken. The Chicken sliders are so dry that they are basically inedible. The beef sliders are flavorless but a lot of ketchup can save almost anything. The fries were even terrible too. Limp and not even served hot. \n\nI don't understand why anyone would ever voluntarily eat at White Castle. I will honestly say that it is the WORST fast food joint I've ever been to with the WORST service I've ever received. I don't even think it's all that cheap neither. Never again even if they're the only place open! I'll save my calories! 1/5",

  "text": "I like the First Impressions of Cafe Liberty even though I've only been here a couple of times, and have only enjoyed a Chai Latte for a quick pick-me-up immediately before jumping on the interstate to make my trek home. I do plan on eating a meal here when I have more time.\n\nIt should be noted that my timing on both occasions at Cafe Liberty was mid afternoon, around 2:30pm-3:00pm, just before closing. Both times that I walked in, I observed that almost all the inside tables were filled with happy, laughing people, visiting with their companions, and enjoying food that smelled divine. A welcoming, comfortable atmosphere, indeed! Outside the coffee shop you will find an additional ten or so tables for you to to sit at, and eat, drink and relax. There is great people watching here as well ;)\n\nCafe Liberty hails from New York. In New York, this company had a city-based office coffee service, and became very successful at it. After 9/11, the owners decided they wanted to move to Florida, settled in Lutz, and began another office coffee service. But eventually, despite their years of success, they wanted in on the retail coffee market. They found an opportunity in April of 2016 to purchase 'Hattie's', the former breakfast place housed in this location, and their own vision was born!\n\nCafe Liberty offers all kinds of Coffee and Tea drinks that you can think of, along with Breakfast Sandwiches, Breakfast Plates, Twisted Benedict's, a thing called a 'Baffle' (bacon infused waffle), Pastries, Burgers & Lunch Sandwiches, along with Desserts, and a Kid's Menu.\n\nThere is a Loyalty Rewards Club Bistro card, which gives you 10% off each meal at every visit, plus a one-time $5 Bonus when you upload their App. There also is a discount for First Responders, Military, Seniors and Health Care Professionals. \n\nThe customer service here is most welcoming, as I said before, but there is a deeper, more genuinely friendly vibe that just makes you feel comfortable and warm. I found everyone to be skilled at getting my order to me correctly, quickly and with a cheerful smile. \n\nI visited the restroom on only one occasion, just before closing. It was perfectly appointed and clean, with the necessary objects of toilet paper, soap and paper towels. No complaints. \n\nOne of these days I'm going back for the 'Baffle' with Crispy Pork Belly! It sounds divine!\n\n*****FIVE FANTASTIC STARS!!!!!*****\n\n\n14/100",

  "text": "For our quick weekend getaway up to Santa Barbara, we stayed at the nearby Hotel Indigo.  The front desk guy gave us a few suggestions for brunch since the restaurant on their property was closed for the day. We remember walking past Eladio's the day before and since we weren't familiar with the area, we went with the spot we knew where to find quickly and the hotel gave us a ten percent discount voucher for Eladio's.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated right away, thank goodness since I unintentionally skipped dinner the night before (let's just say we went to one too many wine tastings, lol).  They had a decent brunch menu, many different traditional options and a full lunch menu that was also available if we opted for something from that menu. Although it was tempting to order fish & chips (it didn't sound right to be eating that at nine thirty in the morning, lol) I decided to try the grilled chicken sandwich since I didn't feel like eating breakfast.\n\nI like how I had the option of getting mixed fries, it was like getting the best of both worlds with the sweet potato fries and regular fries all mixed together on my plate, lol. I enjoyed those a lot, so much that I didn't leave a fry behind.  The sandwich was decent, but the grilled chicken was bland, it could have used some seasoning.  When the sandwich is difficult to bite into (like this one), I usually skip the bread all together and deconstruct it with my fork and knife to make it easier to consume.\n\nThe hubby ate the crab cake benedict with potatoes.  I tried the crab cake and it tasted okay.  I'm not much of a red bell pepper fan and this was the overbearing ingredient in the crab cake he had.  He said it was okay to him, so it's all good.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit dated, it could use a remodel, but I don't know if that's part of the charm of this restaurant located on the property of the hotel it's connected to.  I could have enjoyed a refill on my Diet Coke, but our server was part magician since he did a disappearing act on us as soon as our food came out.  Oh well, it served its purpose in filling us up with food before we got in our car to drive back home to San Diego.",

There is no comparison to the quality, longevity and the ability to ask specific questions to employees at a nursery. \n\nWe bought a gorgeous Japanese maple, a few azaleas and a few salvias to fill the empty space. I've never bought a tree before so I did get a bit of sticker shock ($180!) when I was browsing but was reassured by husband (who has also never bought a tree but seems to \"know\" all about things he has no idea about...) that that's just what they cost. I am very pleased with how it looks so I guess it's worth it. \n\nI am very familiar with shrubs and flowers however and felt satisfied with the prices there ($40 for azaleas and $9 for salvia). \n\nThey are all so healthy and beautiful. Shiny leaves, tight bark and lovely blooms. \n\nThe few employees that we interacted with were lovely and helpful. All of our trees and shrub needs will be met at Cloverdale!",

  "text": "My daughter treated me to lunch here on Sunday. I will not go into it but it was a good memory day for me.\nWe started with pot stickers. They were some of the best that I have had. They were plump with filling and nicely browned on the flat side, they came with a tasty, slightly spicy dipping sauce. I would absolutely order them again! \nWe both ordered the roast duck. She got hers with fried rice and I got mine with the chow mein. The lunch comes with a cup of soup and an egg roll. She got the hot and sour and I got the egg flower. I tasted hers and it was better than others that I have tried , nice balance. The egg flower was excellent, the broth was thicker than most and very tasty. The filling in the egg roll had some nice seasoning , they served some sweet and sour sauce with them. The sweet and sour sauce was good but I felt like it fought with the seasoning it the egg roll. I liked the egg roll dipped in the sauce that they brought with the pot stickers. The duck was excellent! It was very moist and nicely seasoned. Be careful when you are eating it because they chop it into pieces and sometimes there are chips.\nEven if you know where you are going this place sneaks up on you. My daughter passed it and had to turn around. The parking lot goes all the way around the building, with the entrance on the downtown side and the exit on the far side. \nIf you are looking for inexpensive good Chinese food you should give Chinese Duck House a try! There is a reason that they have been here for over 20 years!",

  "text": "So I used to live a block away from Manchu towards City Park, and when I walked my wiener dogs on the neutral ground, I'd find discarded little chicken bones everywhere, or more accurately my dogs would find them. \n\nA couple years later, the Stompers brought Manchu wings to an event. I've said in past reviews, I'm a saucy girl so I was a little taken aback when I was told these wings needed no sauce they were so good. I must've eaten at least a dozen before licking my fingers in agreement. As someone had said before they're breaded, but the meat is perfectly moist and they're just the right size wings. \n\nFast forward a year later, and I'm hosting our Krewe du Vieux Yelp tailgate, and I know our krewe likes to eat, so I order 150 wings early, and am told it'll be about 30/45 minutes. I park a little ways down the street from Manchu with my intern already in line. It's poppin'... People are hanging out outside, a man tries to sell me socks...It's the kick off to Carnival in this area so I totally get it. If you feel unsafe, bring a friend, but really no ones trying to mess with you in Manchu. They have better things to think about, i.e. CHICKEN. \n\nLet me just make a new paragraph to say...If you walk into a packed Manchu with wall-to-wall people, and you see wine & spirits guru Tim McNally picking up 100 wings for HIS party...you know you're doing something right. \n\nThe inside can get pretty cramped, but you can grab pretty much any kinda soda among other things. Just because you order ahead doesn't mean you don't have to wait a little while since other people are placing orders for HUNDREDS of chicken wings among other delicious items. We let them know that we were here to pick up our 150 wings, we paid around $72 and stepped aside to wait while a gentleman coyly smoking a cigarette or maybe it wasn't lit, I can't be sure, hit on the intern. Upon finding out her name was the same as his wife's though, he decided it was time to go home. \n\nThe wings came out about 10ish minutes later and we were on our way! The wings were a huge hit, though I dare say I probably ate 15% of them. You really DON'T need a side sauce of ranch or BBQ, but that might be your preference. One suggestion when ordering this many wings is to get a sterno situation. While I'm not opposed to eating a cold wing on the parade route, you may want to keep them warm! \n\nI suggest Manchu for any kickin' chicken party you want to have whether it's Carnival time or football season. Just please keep ya' bones off the neutral ground...",

  "text": "I remember shopping at this Kmart 15+ years ago and not much has changed. All of the complaints about the service here ring hollow to me: if you want five-star service, then go downtown to Nordstrom or Saks and pay for a personal shopper. Can't afford that? Well, then don't order champagne when all you have is a beer budget. \n\nMost recently, my wife and I quickly found the household items we were looking for and checkout only took a few minutes, which is basically the same experience I've had here for years. Although the store isn't the cleanest and its \"cheap\" prices are only inexpensive in the context of living in Santa Barbara, Kmart is decent option for locals and students trying to save a few bucks.",

Seriously - best ginger candy EVER!  Jon (or maybe John) the shop owner was kind enough to let us sample a few candies and even gave my daughter a special butterscotch candy given that ginger wasn't really her thing.\n\nThe staff were friendly, professional, and offered assistance cheerfully.\n\nI will definitely think of Laurel's on Whyte again in the future for a speciality gift or seasonal decoration to add to our ever growing collection.",

Y'all need to stop it.\n\nTrinity is a nearly 200 year old grand Episcopal church.  And while it is mostly uptown and lilywhite, it has been changing.  Female priests have been hired by the parish since the early 90s and they church does a lot of outreach. I'm a fan of the current rector, Henry.  He was wonderful at the death of a family member a few years ago, when he was brand new.  Amazingly empathetic.",

  "text": "My experience at Hub was almost perfect - the coffee was delightful, the employees were knowledgeable and friendly, and they allowed me to hang out in their cafe nearly all day as I was visiting from out of town and had a bunch of meetings lined up. When I wasn't chatting during these meetings I was getting to know the local regulars who were all equally friendly. Sure, by the end of my time there I was wired with way too much caffeine, but that's my fault, not theirs!\n\nMy only complaint was that when I went it was an extremely hot day, and I purposely scouted a seat near the AC unit because I knew it would get uncomfortable after a while. To my great dismay, it turned out the AC didn't work and never turned on, leaving me sweaty and super hot all day. \n\nNow that we're in the winter months it's hardly an issue, but definitely a big deal during those hot Indian summers! I'll for sure return to the Hub but will be wary of climate limitations going forward!",

My friend (who lives here) brought me here for breakfast, saying, \"Oh, it's just a diner.\" [sings]*Beg to differ!*  Teri's may have the diner atmosphere, but the food was definitely a cut above. \n\nI had the roasted corn pancakes with chive butter and ham. First off, what non-artisanal food establishment has that on their menu? The ham was a wafer-thin slice, crinkly as a sheet of tissue from being hit with the heat. It rested atop the corn cakes, which were full of corn kernels and were sweetish around the edges (like cornbread) but were heartier somehow in the centers. One helping of two cakes was way more than I needed. The chive butter was excellent, a zesty perk-up that would have been missed otherwise. \n\nDefinitely a good choice for a filling breakfast, and not just the usual diner fare.",

They have different cats on special deals, and my adoption fee was $85, but that covered medical evaluation and treatments up until adoption. \n\nThe staff is so friendly and helpful but leave you to browse the cages and figure out what you would like without pressure. Also, the month of June they were running specials for 2 for 1 adoptions. Adopt one kitten, get a second one free! Unfortunately my house would not accommodate two furry friends :). \n\nThey have reasonable prices and even offer low cost vet services. Great location!",

  "text": "This restaurant is a pleasant surprise in more ways than one. For starters, it's located at a major resort, so by default, it's not necessarily a first pick when I'm searching for a local eatery. The menu is Italian- one of my favorite cuisines, and it's done (mostly) right. They have a garden on the property and they actually use the what they grow! They also feature local produce on their menu. They have AVERNA AMARO on their menu. Aside from these little surprises, which may only be relevant to me, here is what you should know. \n\nWhile Primo is a resort restaurant, the prices are fair considering location and quality of ingredients. The portions are hearty, so you definitely won't leave hungry. The staff was friendly, attentive and well versed on the menu. It's definitely more of a special occasion type of place.\n\nAs mentioned, the menu features Italian cuisine with a modern twist. You'll find everything from pizza to assorted bruschette (plural) to hand-made pasta and the classics like Saltimbocca and Cioppino.\n\nI treated my fiancé to dinner for his birthday. We started out with couple a cocktails each at Salud then headed in for dinner. We enjoyed our dinner with a Pinot Noir. Two appetizers (each $9)- The frutti di mare and an order of the bruschetta with house made ricotta and brandied pears. The bruschetta was the hit between the two. The frutti di mare was actually a fritto misto (assorted fried seafood and veggies). It was served with a harissa aioli. It was good, but the bruschetta was delicious! It was actually quite sweet, I could've eaten for dessert. \n\nNext, we share the grilled Spanish octopus. Served with grilled chorizo, cannellini beans, charred onion with a Meyer lemon dressing. We love Octopus and we ordered this on our servers recommendation. The octopus was super tender and the chorizo was thinly sliced. We missed the flavor of the Meyer lemon. Priced at $14, the portion was a more petite than we anticipated.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the House-Made Ricotta Ravioli with Local Lamb. This was probably the best pasta dish I've had in Tucson. Seriously. The dish was presented beautifully with tomato, basil and lamb served over the ravioli. The ricotta was lemony and zesty, the sauce was light was light. I only ate half of my entree. It was so flavorful and rich. My fiancé ordered the Saltimbocca and thoroughly enjoyed it. This dish can easily be shared. It's rich and super hearty. \n\nDessert was on the house- they presented us with canoli. Theirs are served hand-rolled pistachio and chocolate-dipped tuiles, filled with ricotta and topped with cherries. Holy decadence! It was uber sweet and delicious.\n\nWe had a solid meal here and our server was fantastic. The ambiance  is a little dated and definitely screams \"hotel,\" so on my next visit I'll make sure to check out the patio and take in the gorgeous desert views.",

The toppings for their pies are always fresh and I appreciate that the final product is never too greasy.  If you want something a little different try their white pizza.  The lovely wife and I order it with chicken and one or two veges.  It's very very good. \n \nMost of the time when I visit Mark is working.

Something about an all in one stop takes a lot of the fun out of \"shopping\" for me. \n\nThis is irrelevant though. Because the point of this review is to say I had a particularly nice experience using Target curbside service. (Placing an order online and opting to pick it up is a great hack for anyone that blacks out in a  Target and walks out with more than they need. Just sayin'. ) I placed an order online and it was ready for pickup within half an hour. Which impressed me most. \n\nPicking up the order was easy too. You just pull into the determined spots and use the app to let them know you have arrived. They confirmed my order through the car window-I didn't even have to talk to anyone!\n\nThis has been by far my favorite \"curbside pickup\" from a big business yet. They really have streamlined the process. My only gripe is that they used an insane number of bags to pack the order. It seemed wasteful. And since doing curbside pickup keeps you from being able to use reusable bags it was pretty unavoidable. \n\nSolid though, real solid.",

  "text": "One of my go-to places for a healthy lunch.\n\nThis place can get pretty packed for lunch. I like to show up before the noon time rush to ensure I get a table. When the weather is nice, this isn't an issue, since there is a moderate amount of outdoor seating. Normally, it isn't really an issue either, unless you show up with a large party. At 11:40 a.m. when we got there, there was a smattering of tables full. When we left at about 12:30 p.m. it was almost completely packed, with only a couple two people high tops open. We saw a couple sit outside, though I don't know if they did it out of choice or necessity, because it was in the 50s. I was still wearing my jacket inside! \n\nEven though the restaurant can get full, there is plenty of parking! Although this is on a strip with other businesses, there is always parking open.\n\nYou order at the front and then take your number to your table. Service is pretty fast. I tend to always get a greek salad with different meat (usually lamb or shrimp). It is a pretty large portion. It is definitely healthy, because they don't load on the feta. They give you a good portion of meat. It always comes with a pita chip, which I enjoy. It makes me feel less deprived of carbs. \n\nMy friend got the taziki special pasta that is available Friday-Sunday. One warning is on their website it says that dish is over 1,000 calories! Yikes! However, I'm positive she didn't consume that much, because she didn't like the pasta. She said the chicken was delicious, but left all the pasta. I tried a couple pieces out of curiosity. I didn't think it was bad. It tastes strongly of balsamic vinegar. I don't know what makes it over 1,000 calories then, because balsamic vinegar isn't that caloric. Oh well, it will be a mystery.\n\nI've had friends order the Taziki's feast in the past. I think \"feast\" is a bit of a misnomer. It's a normal lunch portion of food. You get a small greek salad, some meat, and a side of potatoes or rice. It's exactly the right portion for the price (which isn't that expensive, around $10 - $12 depending on the meat). Again, I have the feeling that it's a pretty healthy option, which I appreciate. Just don't expect a giant plate of food.\n\nIf you're a Raymond James employee, you get a 10% discount. This is probably one of the major reasons I keep coming back. That and it is a healthy option.",

I'm calling it now, there's a market for this year round.\n\nWhat's this have to do with Dessert Island? Tucked away, just on the outskirts of Chinatown, is a Hong Kong style dessert house that screams hidden gem. It's located right beside Fuqing Lanzhou Noodle. Just go a block south of Lucky 97 Supermarket.\n\nThe inside is small but cozy with a couple tables and couch to sit on. I like how they have a little picture flipbook on the table for you to peruse. Everything is made to order and it's cool that you can see the mother/daughter combo making your dessert right in front of you. I've visited a couple times now and while the service has been great both times, very friendly and genuine, it's been pretty empty. Hope they get busier!\n\nTheir hours are pretty random but generally, it goes as: Monday, Wednesday and Thursday (4:00pm-9:00pm), Friday and Saturday (4:00pm-12:00am) and Sunday (4:00pm-10:00pm).\n\nThe menu is actually much bigger than you would think. Lots of different types of desserts to choose from - there's even real food if you aren't craving dessert.\n\n- Mango supreme snowflake ice ($13.50) - we were pretty stuffed from dinner next door so we decided to share a dessert. I let M decide and that was a wise choice because she picked a winner. The mango supreme was divine. Soft, fluffy shaved ice piled high with a generous scoop of mango ice cream, fresh mango pieces and drizzled with condensed and coconut milk. Rich, creamy but still delightfully refreshing.\n\n- Red bean green bean & jelly cooler ($5.95) - Jboi wanted to try out one of their drinks and went with the red bean green bean combo. He said it tasted a lot like beans. LOL, thanks for the insight bruh.\n- Mango supreme snowflake ice ($13.50) - had to get the mango supreme again but this time we shared between four people (instead of two). Much more doable and yes, you can still order this when it's -30.\n\nI'll be back to try their eggette waffle cones next time as we've barely scratched the surface of Dessert Island's desserts. This is the perfect after dinner spot if you're downtown or in Chinatown. Seriously, just go. You'll be pleasantly surprised.",

  "text": "Tini as in Tiny. But in a cozy, intimate, it's-almost-European-the-way-we're-in-eachother's-personal-space kind of way.  Maybe the perfect setting for making a friend? Or stepping on toes? Whichever you fancy. Either way, some friends and I ended our Cinco de Mayo fiesta at Tini. The Beyonce was bumping and the bartenders were friendly, so tequila or not, we were set. \n\nTini is sleek - think modern architecture, a lit up alcohol wall, tvs screening music videos and cool colors like blue and silver. (stop yourself from making music requests - the music on the tv is on a roll - no altering this playlist). The entire space is probably 12 feet wide tops - no exaggeration. The suffocation factor is my primary reason for not running to Tini as one of my top bar choices - but the location (right down the street from my home) does make it mighty handy. \n\nAs for drinks, I didn't go too wild, so this is a horrible example. But, I have been told for quite some time that I needed to try a pickleback shot - so that I did. Quite delightful - went down easy - heavy on the sodium.",

  "text": "Don't fence me in! As Nevadans we LOVE our wide open spaces, and when it comes to our parks, they're no different than we are. \n\nRancho is a great example of a Nevada outdoor space. It brings together a wide open off leash dog park, beautiful pavilions perfect for picnicking, water features, swing sets and jungle gyms, miles of hiking trails and even a full 18 hole disc golf course! \n\nThis week the weather was ridiculously nice for February, and the day was just begging to be taken advantage of with some outdoor recreation. Some friends and I decided to play a round of disc golf, and headed up to the park. The disc golf course is located in the Multisports Complex just north of McCarran on Virginia Street. There are signs once you turn in, and parking is a plenty. \n\nTo play disc golf you need to start with some discs. So either go with a friend that has some or pick some up before you head to the course. The course is set all over a wide expanse of open space with clear markers and baskets denoting each tee box and finish. I had been told that the course was a bit of a hike, but I only found a few spots that had me walking uphill. There are all sorts of pathways cut into the ground to show you the easiest way to reach your disc. That said, you can end up in some interesting spots when you factor in wind and novice ability, so I'd recommend pants and decent shoes just in case you find yourself neck deep in the sagebrush. \n\nNow the official placards say no pets permitted on course, but I couldn't help but let my dog come along with me on this adventure. The sign didn't seem to be stopping anyone else either. Some dogs were leashed, some unleashed, and mine on his electronic leash. I think as long as they're under control, no one is going to say anything. \n\nAs a newcomer to the game, this was a fun way to kill an hour and worth the investment of a couple bucks to get a basic set of discs to play. There are lots of courses scattered around the area and I'm excited to check out another one soon.",

  "text": "First off I'll start by saying I am estatic about how close this brewery is to me. I've tried a few breweries near me and find that their beers lack complexity however they all seem to understand that if you make a cool place to hangout people will come and drink your not so special beers. Spellbound brewery on the other hand has made the cool hangout spot and have such a nice array of complex yet smooth beers. \n\nFor my first visit, using a gps we arrived easily but I have to admit we missed the entrance sign and ended up parking in the rear and entering through the actual brewery. Not a big deal as employees guided us the right way.\n\nWhile there I had a flight of the peach ipa, cherry chocolate porter, tripel, and cofffee porter. Each beer was smooth and had so many layers of flavor. The beers ACTUALLY tasted as described! Imagine that! My favorite was the cherry chocolate porter followed by the tripel. I had taken a peek at the website before my visit and was so excited to try the oatmeal raisin cookie sadly this was not on tap. \n\nNow my only question is do they allow food? This would be such a cute spot to spend a relaxing weekend afternoon.\n\n****After my initial visit I found out you are allowed to bring your own food. I love grabbing a cheeseteak, pizza, and/or wings to bring along.",

  "text": "Happy Hour review: \nWhen looking for dining options downtown, it can be difficult to find something that a local would want to visit, but I am happy to report that Woolworth is a really nice option! This diner-style open concept is unique and gives a feeling of art deco. The projector showing old movies and background music adds to that feeling I'm sure. I love the giant long bar and stools; the overall vibe of the place is really nice. We grabbed a seat around 5:30 for happy hour. They offer drink specials with a daily cocktail for $5 and wine, mules, and martinis for $6. We ended up ordering a bottle of wine for $25 or so and split it between us. For food we ordered the fried pickles, okra, and jalapenos plus the soup of the day which was broccoli cheese. It was a nice snack and everything tasted really good! It was a perfect way for 2 locals to kick off a fun night out (cheaply) adjacent to Broadway. I'll definitely be back to sample more of the menu!",

The decor was olive drab lunch counter tile work but the dogs and toasted cheese sandwiches were very creative and equally delicious.\n\nI had a very nice toasted cheese with white cheddar, bacon, and blueberry jam! Who knew how awesome this would be? Not this guy but now, I'm going to get some blueberry jam for my homemade toasted cheese! Did you know the super secret to wonderfully evenly browned toasted cheese? I will reveal the surprising secret now to you... Put store-bought, not homemade, mayonnaise on the outside of the bread and fry away! The oil/egg/salt mixture makes for an incredibly crunchy and wonderful toasted cheese! I think they do the same at Kings Street but I don't know that for a fact.\n\nMy wife had a hot dog with blue cheese, bacon, and fresh jalapenos that was equally delicious! The dog was nicely browned and the mixture was a flavor sensation. She doesn't even like blue cheese but I guess she made an exception for a hot dog with bacon!\n\nFinally, my strawberry shortcake $5 shake was stupendous, with fresh berries, a nice slice of perfect shortcake and tons of wonderful whipped cream. I'd go back just for the shake!\n\nMy only reason for four stars rather than five was the service was not particularly engaging or friendly. I know everyone has a bad day but service is a critical part of the restaurant experience!",

  "text": "I got a great haircut from Jacqui.\n\nMy hair is one thing I don't mess with. I still remember being 8 years old and sobbing when my dad cut my hair too short. He was never allowed with scissors near my head again. Therefore, going to the right hair stylist is super important to me. When I see someone with a good haircut I will ask where they go - and then I check Yelp to read the reviews of the masses of course. I love my friend's hair and figured she wouldn't lead me astray, so when she told me she goes here to see Jacqui, I booked an appointment. I felt like I had gotten in a rut with my old stylist and I needed something new.\n\nFirst, bring a picture! I don't know why that idea alluded me, but my friend always brings a picture when she wants something new and it turns out great. It is so much easier to show someone visually what you want than to explain it. My hair looks so much like the picture and I absolutely love it.\n\nJacqui can style both long and short hair. My friend has barely touching your shoulders hair and I have middle of my back. My friend originally went to Jacqui when another hairdresser royally screwed up her hair. Jacqui fixed it. She's a boss like that and my friend has been going ever since (a couple of years).\n\nMake sure you book an appointment well in advance. I was in the middle of April and wanted an appointment the first week in May. Jacqui only had one slot open, 1:45 p.m. on a Thursday. Seriously, only one slot. She has loyal customers, which is always a good sign.\n\nThe facilities itself is clean and bright. Parking is super easy since they have their own lot behind the building. \n\nThis is my new go-to for a haircut. I wish they had scheduling online, since I'm all about that fast-paced life, but I can deal if I have to call to make an appointment. I would definitely recommend Jacqui if you're looking for a new stylist!",

I stopped in during the week, closer to lunch time and grabbed a seat at the counter (though there were plenty of tables in the main and auxiliary dining rooms.)\n\nThe young man who was working the counter promptly brought out my beverage and a menu and suggested the special soup of the day, a beer cheese, as being particularly good.  So, I ordered it and he was right!  Not just a simple yellow bowl, but bits of roasted red pepper and topped with unmelted shredded cheese, served in a bowl with a doily and colorful plate.  It looked delicious and was!\n\nI also ordered the Eggs Benedict which came out just after I finished my soup.  I've had EB lots of places, but this was the best presentation/flavor combination I've had!  Instead of leaving the Hollandaise sauce a bland looking yellow atop the English Muffin/ham/poached egg combo, the sauce was sprinkled with paprika and parsley flakes, adding a festive look.  The eggs were made to order (soft/easy poaching) and served with additional bits of flavor/color in a strawberry and orange slice twist.  This was a splendid breakfast.\n\nService was excellent throughout the meal and I will return to try some of their other options.\n\nReview #2101",

Not only does she paint one of a kind pieces, but she offers prints at a reasonable price and she does commissioned work. If you are short on wall space, you can wear Becky's art on your body via one of the shirts she sells with her prints on it.\n\nPositioned right on Magazine St., I like that the gallery walk-able from other little galleries and shops on the block and makes for a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. Gallery B Fos is set up perfectly with nice flow and wide open space, so that you can view all of her artwork and the staff working here was super helpful in making sure that I was being taken care of. \n\nGallery director Felice helps with the art consumer's needs and answers questions when the artist is off site and soon Gallery B Fos will be offering jewelry inspired by Becky's work, so stay tuned for greatness.",

Service from Chelsea was friendly, fast, and thoughtful.  \n\nInside is modern and hip yet comfortable.  White walls, succulents, cute black & white woven chairs, exposed ductwork, and macrame air plant hangers really make the place feel UPSCALE, YO. \n\nFor an appetizer we had the $7 chips with guacamole and salsa.  The guacamole was so fresh & chunky!  The chips were warm and crispy and fresh.  The salsa was tangy and refreshing.  I loved every single bite.  \n\nI had my favorite lean n' clean bowl for $8 which has broccolini, broccoli, cauliflower, pico de gallo, and chopped cilantro.  For the base I chose the shaved brussels and chopped kale blend and I added crispy lentil bites.  The lentil bites are something I haven't seen on the menu at the Brandon location and I LOVED them.  Imagine a square starchy tater tot, crunchy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. The menu there said they were $3 extra, the online menu says they are $2.50 extra, and I was actually charged $3.50 extra, so no idea how much they will cost you.  It'll be a surprise.  \n\nWhen it was time to go Chelsea brought me a box to pack up my food and - get this - she brought me a fresh bag of chips to go with my salsa and guac.  How friggin thoughtful is that???  \n\nSo much love goes into every plate here.  Don't tell the Brandon location, but I like this one better.  It is SO HARD to find real food in restaurants nowadays which is why I love this place.",

It was very interesting and really delicious. It was cold, which I didn't expect for some reason, but I was into it.\n--Stuffed Red Pepper- very good, and surprisingly big for $14. We had leftovers\n--Lamb Rogan Josh-also good sized portion, very tender, great flavors. More leftovers.\n\nDRINKS:\n--Indebluetini is delicious-like a less creamy mango lassi cocktail.\n--Karma chai sutra was my selection and I had serious drink envy, this tasted like a chai spiced white russian and was way too milky for me. Not a fan, but that's more of a personal preference.\n\nMy friend and I had a lot of catching up to do, and probably spent 3 hours there and never felt rushed, which was awesome.

  "text": "Since I retired, I've spent a lot of time checking out public art, historic buildings with cool architecture, and visiting most areas of the city just to see what I've been missing.  So, I couldn't believe I took so long to visit Coat Check Coffee.  And, I wasn't even planning on it.  I was taking pictures of a new art installation on the west end of the Athenaeum.\n\nSo, imagine my delight when I stepped into this massive building (b. 1893) that is filled with beautiful woodwork throughout the entryway.  But, in case you were thinking this would be some stuffy, highbrow place, a vividly colorful mural is painted on the east wall of the stairwell and wraps around through the entry.  Once I got up the stairs to the main floor, the space was transformed into a modern and stylish meeting space with lots of guests plugged in to their computers in small groups sipping coffee and noshing on munchies.\n\nIt was a little confusing since there wasn't really a line for ordering...lots of folks just standing near the order counter.  Still, the server behind the counter called out to me and said she would be with me in a moment.  And she was.\n\nThat gave me time to look over the counters of food on display.  They don't have a lot of food to choose from, but I'll take quality over quantity any time!  \n \nI wanted something sweet, so I picked a Blueberry Cheesecake Macaron.  Wow!  Fresh and tasty.  I wanted something savory, so I picked a Ham and Cheese Croissant.  Fresh baked, warm and buttery.  Another Wow!\nAnd when it comes to coffee, I have simple tastes:  a cup of black coffee that isn't scalding hot and has a rich flavor.  Tinker Coffee took care of that and I could drink it as soon as I picked my spot to enjoy it.  No burned tongue to make the food (and coffee) become tasteless.  Everything from service to taste to environment was good and felt relaxed and inviting.\n\nOn the technical side, you hover near the counter and step up when you see an opening.  They take your name and call out to you when it is ready.  They didn't seem to have trays, so be aware you may have to juggle a bit if you order a lot.  Coffee is served in real mugs, not disposables.  That means, you need to bus your own space (a collection bin is near the place to get napkins on the main floor.)  And parking isn't free.  Hopefully, you can find a metered street spot close by.\n\nThey just celebrated their first anniversary in this space at the time of my review.  Don't wait for a reason to go...just go!\n\nReview #589",

If you walk up the stone stairs, you get to see the murals that are being restored. They look so perfect that it's hard to believe that they were painted so many years ago. The Walnut Room is huge, if you are looking for a place to hold an elegant reception and there is even a flight school here. Here's a secret: I have always wanted to learn to fly, but I've never had the guts to look into lessons. Now that I know that there is a flight school at this airport, I might just have to give it some real thought.\n\nBe sure to look down at the floor to see how many miles away from New Orleans different cities are (this will make more sense when you see it in person). The Lakefront Airport is a must visit for everyone.",

  "text": "I had heard quite a bit about Marché . I was truly looking forward to the experience. My friend had came up from Memphis on a whim, and we had a couple of dining excursion with this being the finale of his visit. \n\nSunday brunch was already set in our minds to be a bit of a crazy, so the 1 hour and 15 minute wait came as no surprise. We expected it and this by no means is something to complain about when you know it is going to be that way. Consider this - East Nashville, Instagrammable dining experience both in atmosphere with food and dining room, plus everyone knowing Marché's reputation. If you don't expect a wait when coming here and then complain about it on Yelp; your Yelp review provides very little validity in my book. \n\nSpeaking about Sunday brunch - the hostesses who were handling the seating were exceptionally nice and very great at what the did. I appreciated them not being stuffy and like we owed them something. So often, you will find yourself in a position where you are going to the hostess stand and them having some sort of pretentious attitude like we as the diners owe them something. Example - Husk. Marché didn't have this and I am grateful for it.\n\nThe kind customer service flowed over to our server, Dylan. Dylan was a super sweet guy who throughout the dining experience ensured that we were content. Except... I wasn't content. \n\nWhen the food arrived, my food came out cold. The grits had already coagulated. They had clearly been out for awhile and the eggs and turkey sausage were no better and also cold. To make matters worse, I found a hair in my food towards the end of the meal in my scrambled eggs. That was the icing on the cake. I didn't mention it to Dylan because at that point I could tell he already felt bad about the cold food which he offered to return. I declined and I just wanted to eat since we did wait for that hour and 15 minutes. I was hungry! \n\nAt the end of the meal, he mentioned he took off my breakfast saying that was not the standard of the restaurant. I truly appreciated him in doing so. He mentioned that day must have been an off day since someone else had said that their food was cold, too, so this was not an isolated incident.\n\nMy friend enjoyed his meal. He got the omelette and we split their mediocre french toast. I wasn't blown away by it. It didn't have flavor and the syrup didn't add substance to it.\n\nConclusion - food sucked on this particular day and service and ambiance were amazing. Wish the food could have highlighted the experience as well.",

  "text": "During a spontaneous jaunt and without any preconceived expectations in my mind, my partner and I decided to visit Edwardsville, Illinois while in southern Illinois.  This Historic Route 66 commuter college town was extremely quaint and pleasant, but what made it all worth the trip was Springers Creek roadside winery.  Thanks to Yelp, we discovered this little hidden gem just about a 2-3 minute drive outside of downtown.  The winery is made up of a historically converted grocery store and a neighboring home connected by a garden.  The owners started the business purely as a hobby, and now find themselves making 11 different wines (all made from juices versus the grapes themselves).  The husband tends to the gardens and performs live music in the evenings, while the wife serves up wine and participates in friendly conversation.  \nThe main structure has a few tables to relax at with a cheese plate (no other food is served so feel free to bring your own hors d'oeuvres) and a bar for FREE wine tastings--my kinda place!  All bottles range from $15-24, while glasses cost $5-6.50 each.  If you buy 6 bottles or more, you earn a 10% discount.  Antiques, stained glass and other historic art cover the houses and two wine gardens.  I purchased a glass of their chilled Orchard Hill (a sweet White wine with a blend of Riesling & apple flavors) while my partner drank his favorite, Mother Road Red (a sweet blend of red wine & black raspberry).  We took our glasses in hand and explored the two secret gardens and historic homes feeling right at home.  Check out my various photos of the business: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0p9e6khsaLVK7DRykV_vfA?select=vQJZ60siZmMOPLk18Lkfhg#6NRvvYTX6I1Q8IBlbJVsWg\n\nKeep in mind that the winery is closed Monday thru Wednesday and open mainly in the afternoons into the evening.  Oh and if you figure out why there is a random old cell phones nailed to every door, please let me know why this is.",

Tonight (Friday), I enjoyed a lovely night out with Miss Tina K for a happy hour endeavor! We enjoyed Emerald Isle cocktails ($6), some wine and I also had the Debonair Martini ($8) with bleu cheese olives. The burgers are $8 and we tried the Burrata ($6) which came with roasted grape tomatoes, arugula and crostini. Very tasty! The interior of the restaurant is very beautiful with dark oak and wine inspired wood floors. Happy Hour specials are only available in the bar area which is bustling, but not impossible to find seating. Crystal was our server and she was phenomenal!! Very attentive and courteous, ensuring we were set on drinks and gave us time to ponder our menu choices. I will definitely be back for another evening at Flemings! Great atmosphere!",

It's located right on Market Street and has outdoor seating so on this warm October day we chose to seat outside.  When we chose one of the aluminum tables we were rewarded with all the sounds of the city and some great people watching.  I'll be honest, I have passed Sonny's hundreds of times never giving it a thought. Shame on me because the proprietors serve great steaks with smiles. Peruse their website and see they value their commitment to the city in which they were born and they take pride in having been awarded GQ's best Philly cheesesteak.\n\nWe both ordered cheesesteaks with a shared order of fries. My palate was happy with the nicely chopped ribeye and perfect amount of cheese. What impressed me was how good it was minus the grease of other cheesesteaks I've had elsewhere. My daughter said it was the best meal she had all week.\nWhen my expat Philly friends are in town, I will now be taking them only to Sonny's to satisfy their cheesesteak fix.",

  "text": "Fried cheese curds are the best way to start the day! If you've never done it before, you owe it to yourself to make it happen! I discovered Ryan's a year or so ago, thanks to the RGJ and their top burgers in Reno/Sparks. Ryan's was right up there with some local legends in the article, and they definitely didn't tell no lies about this one. \n\nRyan's is an old bar on Wells Ave. that's been around since the early 70's! Yep, that's right, more than 30 years, so you know their doing something right. The hand painted murals inside and out are very cool, telling tales of times in Reno that have long past, and I can only imagine what they'd say if the walls of this place could talk! \n\nRyan's serves a pretty standard selection of domestic beers and mixed drinks, and their Irish coffees are pretty tasty too. But I come for the food! They've got a small charbroiler, griddle, and fryer that turn out some pretty decent grub. \n\nI always start with the fried cheese curds. You get a big pile of gooey, chewy, crispy delicious nuggets of of fried cheese served with ranch dressing. The bar sports a nice selection of hot sauces, so I add a little dash and it's the perfect cure for whatever ails ya. Then I move onto one of their deliciously gigantic burgers, which I always share with the lady. A burger in its purest form is the way to go, charbroiled patty, well seasoned, topped with special sauce, lettuce, tomato, and onion, on a soft bun served with HANDCUT fries. That's right... fries are cut and fried to order in this old school establishment. PRO TIP: If you like your burger medium rare, like me, there's a 50% chance you'll get it that way, all depending on who's working and if the bar isn't that busy! \n\nRyan's has no real windows, so it's the perfect place to forget about the world outside, and settle down with a big frosty mug of Bud Light and a down and dirty juicy burger. For me, Ryan's was love at first bite, and it's become a flavor I crave. Go try it for yourself!",

No cart restrictions. Very few areas on the course with visible areas affected by the horrible weather this month. I didn't even have mud on my golf shoes when I took them off after finishing my round.\n\nOh, and here's the best part: I played 18 holes in under 90 minutes.\n\nThat's not a misprint. Nor a lie. If you know anything about golf, you know what that means. I had the course pretty much all to myself this afternoon and made the most of it. \n\nLook, this is not Augusta National Golf Club. It is a Par 61 that barely stretches to 3500 yards if you play all the way from the back tees that usually aren't even set up. \n\nHowever, IT WAS PLAYABLE when nothing else in the area was and I paid the nice lady in the Pro Shop all of $8 cash to cover greens fees, cart and as much time as I wanted on a very nicely maintained putting green.\n\nSpeaking of inexpensive, their prices for food and beverage are very low. While I don't personally drink beer or eat at golf properties, Countryway sells a large draft beer for $2.75 and virtually every sandwich or lunch item runs about $5 or less.\n\nWhile Countryway isn't my first, second or, well, fifteenth choice to play golf in Tampa, I must give them credit for how the course drains and how they do not overcharge their customers.",

There are three floors of permanent and temporary exhibition galleries highlighting 12,000 years of Florida's history. The highlights for me were the following. \n\n1. The Touchton Map Library. It is the only cartographic center in the southeastern United States and has over 8,000 original maps, charts and other documents dating back to the discovery of the New World. Very interesting! \n\n2. The presentation of the Seminole Wars\nfrom 1817-1858 and the Seminole warrior Coacoochee  was great with really cool special effects. The exhibit explores how African slaves worked with the Seminoles to protect the land. Really enlightening! \n\n3. I most enjoyed Treasure Seekers! You learn about pirates and privateers including thier unique form of democracy. This included the interactive\nPirates Fate  which is an 8-minute action-packed  inmersion  on the high seas with Pirates Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny. This is based on two real-life Buccaneers who sailed the Caribbean in search of plunder in the early 18th century. You vote on which direction to sail and you have an opportunity to fire a cannon at the enemy. I manned the canon and picked which direction to sail. Let me tell you, when the need arose,  I did not hesitate to fire that cannon and steal the booty!! Very fun! \n\nTerry Zitek was our guide and he did an incredible job!  We had a great time. You can really spend all day here!",

The service was great and my diet coke was constantly being refilled, as were everyone else's beverages, but other than that I was not impressed.\n\nOysters Desire (broiled oysters with garlic butter, parmesan cheese, & creole seasoning) - There was way too much \"stuff\" going on and you could barely even tell there was an oyster in there.  Way too cheesy and greasy (and mind you, I quite enjoy cheese and grease... just not with my oysters).\n\nOysters on the Half Shell - these were better than the oysters desire since they were more \"pure\" and allowed us to actually taste the oyster, but were nothing special.\n\nFried Green Tomato Stack (fried green tomatoes with remoulade sauce) - We took a bite of these and didn't eat any more.  Way too much breading camouflaging the green tomatoes... I could have been eating fried anything.\n\nCrawfish Etouffe (crawfish tails in a brown creole sauce served over rice) - This was okay. It's possible that I'm just not a big etouffe person since this was my first time having it, but my friend confirmed that it was not the best and that I shouldn't judge etouffe based on my experience here.\n\nDesire House Salad (tomato, cucumber, red onion & fresh croutons) - Just a basic house salad, sadly probably the best thing we had here!\n\nI will say that the Po Boy that someone else ordered looked quite delicious, but that for the most part everything here seemed to have more sauce / cheese / grease etc. than it needed to.

I put that in quotes because I think we vaguely heard the jazz trio play for 10 minutes before they went on break? Or played another room?? Who knows but the food was some of the best we had in NOLA.  Hubby was in hog heaven here when he saw fried chicken livers on the menu. He declared them amazing but he got ALL those to himself. I don't eat organs. \n\nAnyway he also got the chicken and sausage gumbo. This was LEGIT. The roux was thick and charry and the pro tip is this:  don't EVEN think about ordering the buttermilk biscuit, not because they're not good, but because they will bring you a complimentary huge loaf of French bread that made my saliva instantly dry up when my thumb punctured the dry crispy crust. But, trust me. Put some a that real butta up on it and sop up that roux!  Laripen\n\nFor our entrees I got the unpronounceable oeuf en croute which means bread stuffed with cheese n chorizo and covered with two yolky eggs. In English it translates to \"Hangover Annihilator\". But hubby won the day with the Shrimp n Grits....specifically the Grits. They have them as a side also so just get them. This ain't yo mama's grits fo sho. No cheese up in them, just gallons of rich cream.  I was on vacation, so calories don't stick right?\n\nThis meal was so big and rich we didn't eat again for another twelve hours!

I'm not sure whether there's a US equivalent.  The other neat thing these guys do is give you Canadian Tire Money if you purchase in cash.  It's as good as money and the paper itself seems to be of higher quality that US or Canadian currency.\n\nI enjoy just poking around the store and seeing what they have.  Often times, I'm come out with a tool or garden-related purchase that I'll haul back to California with me.  Chances are they carry it back home, but who cares when you're having such a great retail therapy experience!",

I got the chance to try so many different beers and really liked all of the beers I tried! The VIP hour was worth it because there was many specialty small batch beers being poured during this hour. Some of the breweries even continued to pour their special beers throughout the day too! This fest has everything from sour beers, to IPAs, to stouts, to refreshing ciders and more. Tri-Tip BBQ sandwiches were around and so delicious too! There was some other vendors besides just food and drinks. There was some clothing vendors, a cocktail mixer company, and a jewelry vendor too! I thoroughly enjoyed the band and the live music too. By the end of the event everyone was dancing and having such a great time! I had so much fun at this event and I look forward to coming again in the future.",

They're doing some big DIY renovations and I offered to lend a helping hand. When we went into Lowe's we didn't really know where anything was. We asked a employee for help and told them what we were looking for. This guy had no tact. He literally said \"that's in the tools aisle\" when we asked where a tool was. \nI know he just had poor people skills, but clearly we don't know where the tool aisle is if we're asking for a tool...he did the same things when we asked where tarps and masks would be. Another employee kind of stepped in to take over while this guy ran off. Thank goodness, she was way more helpful.\n\nWe found everything we needed and got out of there. Every time I come here it's like pulling teeth from employees to find out where stuff is. There aren't many options for massive home improvement warehouses but if they want to step up their game I think customer service is the easiest way to go.",

  "text": "I've had great luck at Native, whether with the wings, pizza, the fries, the nachos or the salad.\n\nBut how could a brand new place get so many negative reviews so fast?! \n\nReading the other reviews here, it looks like service is the issue of most concern. But I figured that, despite the negative reviews, I would give this place a try.\n\nI'm so glad we did.\n\nI didn't experience the poor service that others have described, and the meal was exceptional. Before I get into all that, a few things:\n\nThis is a sports bar. To its core. You have three distinct seating areas. There's the main dining room with booths and tables. There's the bar area with high tables. And there's the outdoor patio that has tables and cushy-looking sofas. It looks to be two TVs on the patio and numerous television sets throughout the interior.\n\nWe sat in the dining room. It has a strange feeling that is eerily reminiscent of a cafeteria. But it was comfortable.\n\nThe place gets busy and loud, but the acoustics are decent. So you don't feel like you are sitting in on your next-door neighbors conversations.\n\nThere will likely be times where there will be a wait. For that, the restaurant offers and indoor seating area and a few chairs outside.\n\nNow to the food.\n\nThey have burgers, salads, lettuce wraps, wings, chicken strips, nachos, mozzarella sticks, pizzas, calzones, flatbreads, fish and chicken dishes... so much!\n\nWe had big eyes and tiny bellies, so we ordered way too much food.\n\nWe got the queso nachos with pork for an appetizer. This was an ample serving, with lots of pork mixed in, not just on the surface of the cheese. Plenty for three people.\n\nWe were thrilled to pieces about the wings. I went with the habanero mango and the Parmesan. Both were exceptional. Nice amount of meat -- but not the kind of wings that make you wonder if the chickens were pumped up with steroids -- and good, deep flavor.\n\nI also went with two ghost pepper wings. I've never had anything flavored by ghost chiles, and both the waitress and the server warned me that I was in for it. It was true! I like to think that my threshold for hot spices high, but now I don't know. They are insanely fiery! I was only able to eat half of one. HALF OF ONE. That's especially after having already had habanero-flavored wings. That's okay, I took my 1.5 ghost wings home and was able to eat the rest later.\n\nI had a slice of pizza -- Meaty Beast with four different types of meat. What impressed me the most was how fresh and flavorful it was! It was a thinner crust, and you can actually taste the herbs in the crest. Bonus! Some of the best pizza I have had as of late.\n\nI was also glad to see that the restaurant keeps regular specials, so the chances of you seeing specials on a visit are pretty good.\n\nAnd while this is a chain, it certainly has a bit of a local feel. There was lots of good energy and laughter, and even a couple of local folks bumped into each other seemingly after not seeing one another in a while.\n\nSo, despite the negative reviews, I'm giving it an endorsement. And I look forward to another visit soon.",

From beginning to the end they clean your vehicle inside and out and that is for every car or truck, including hand towel drying. \n\nMany services are available for that special touch on your wheels or steam cleaning carpets. I have leather seats, which need some TLC, I hate this job and I need to inquire whether or not they do this. \n\nEach vehicle is assigned a supervisor to make sure your baby leaves glowing. They have added a hand wash bay for over sized vehicles and to save yourself time they offer oil changes and lubes. If you would rather have them completely hand wash and wax your priceless gem, this can be done for an additional charge. \n\nTheir local and on line coupons and the pride they take in their work have kept me coming back. They are open seven days per week, all year 'round, which is great in the winter months.  I hate washing my car, but I also hate paying for a lick and a promise and for peanuts these guys do an awesome job inside and out!

It looks like there are about 10 parking places for this restaurant, which means your only other option is to park in some of the nearby county beach areas, which will cost you money.  One thing that really chaps my ass is when a restaurant doesn't have ample parking to match their seating capacity.  There were cars lined up outside with people jockeying for position to get the next available spot.  I thought two grown ass men were going to duke it out over one in particular.  Both claiming they were there first.  It was insane.  I was on crutches, so I didn't have the physical ability to park down the street and around the corner, nor did I want to.  So after viewing what a mad house the place was, we drove over to Mike's Dockside Bar & Grill where parking was plentiful, free and close to the restaurant!  \n\nSorry Sam's, but you have better be giving away gold with every meal in order to get a return visit from me.",

  "text": "This concert venue is a classic case of great concept, terrible execution, all managed by one of the most customer unfriendly corporations in America. I've been to three shows here, and you'd think that with it's location along the river in Camden County, driving to the show and parking would be easy right? Oh no. First, there are no main routes to the stadium so you must drive through the worst part of Camden, and pray you do not have to stop at a light. This is the city with the highest crime rate in NJ and one of the worst in the US. People who poo-poo the dangers of this city don't read the paper. Did the city fathers & developers even consider the safety of patrons when locating this place?\n\nSo as you actually approach the concert venue, you are herded into parking lots that consist of pothole ridden industrial parking lots with no services, minimal lighting and no security. On the way IN there are plenty of Live Nation employees to relieve you of your $25 - $30 and direct you to your parking spot. However, on the way OUT, there is no one around at all, and they don't open any extra gates (which they could easily do to disperse traffic and move people efficiently). So it can easily take you an hour just to get out of the parking lot, at which point you are now driving back through Camden at midnight or so. Would you be my neighbor?\n\n This practice is beyond greed and unprofessional-ism, and goes right to reckless disregard for the safety & comfort of concert patrons. When the concert-going public was up in arms a few years ago about the Ticketmaster/Live Nation merger, this is exactly the kind of mismanagement & profiteering we were concerned about. Thank you, NJ Legislature for making it all come true.\n\nThe concert venue itself is a pretty nice place to see & hear a show, once you are inside, with wide main aisles, it's fairly easy to get around, and the acoustics aren't bad. Most of the servers are friendly enough, but if you choose to eat or drink here, prepare to have you wallet lightened considerably. $14 for a basic (large) beer, and $16 for \"premium\"? Seriously?\nIt is highly unlikely I would go here again for a show because Live Nation has so mismanaged the entire experience that you feel abused from the minute you arrive until after you leave Camden. Frankly, they should pay us to go here.",

I haven't been to downtown Franklin since I graduated high school, so I was looking forward to something special and the reviews on Yelp promised just that. \n\nThe menu suggested I was in the right place, especially when I saw a side of pulled pork available for breakfast for only $3.99. Anyway, if you come here for breakfast, make sure that your order is not coming out of the steam rack of pre-cooked items like biscuits, sausage, bacon, and potatoes. I can forgive a lot, but one thing I will never forgive of Puckett's is this.....Middle Tennessee is the defacto capital of pork sausage in the known universe, there can be no disputing this. What I was served was a grayish brown flimsy piece of sausage that had no flavor, and looked like it had been in the steamer for most of the morning. The only thing on my plate that didn't come from the service line was my eggs which with all the soggy food I was served didn't impress either.\n\nPerhaps the worst offense, even moreso than the awful sausage was the guy on the service line that was using his bare hands to put bacon on the plates to be served. Are you f'in kidding me?!?!? $20 with tip and my contribution to Puckett's is finished forever. Next time I'll just go to Cracker Barrel where I know I can get a quality cooked to order breakfast for 1/2 the price!",

  "text": "Disappointed with this meal.\n\nIt pains me to write this review, because I want Tampa Bay to have good dim sum spots. Let me start by saying I am not a dim sum connoisseur. All my extended family lives in San Francisco and I grew up outside of Houston so I would say I have more experience than your average dim sum goer, but I'm still not at the level as my friend who grew up in San Francisco and recently moved here from Singapore. \n\nI expected this place to be better. I saw the rating and when we walked in, it reminded me of places in San Francisco. We came at about 2 p.m. on a Sunday and tried a ton of their dim sum plates and one plate off their regular menu - the beef and vegetable chow fun. \n\nThe dim sum dishes that I remember we tried were shrimp dumplings, beef meatballs, shumai, shrimp stuffed bean curd, chive dumplings, steamed pork buns, sticky rice, and egg tarts. I don't eat pork so I didn't try some of these dishes, but what I did try I didn't particularly care for. \n\nThe shrimp dumpling skin tasted like it was old and had been reheated. Same with the bean curd - it was hard and chewy. My dad, who has a lot more discerning taste for dim sum than me having grown up in SF, said both the shumai and the beef meatballs were ok, but not great. That was our general consensus about everything, it was edible, but nothing we'd go back for. \n\nI was particularly disappointed with the beef chow fun. I found the noodles to be soggy. I thought the beef was pretty tender, but my dad said it didn't really compare to other places he's been. \n\nThe one dish I did like was the egg tart. It had a different taste than I was used to, a little more eggy. The crust wasn't that flakey, but I liked it.\n\nI was hoping to find a dim sum place I liked more than Yummy House, but this isn't it. I'll have to keep looking.",

All were delicious AND the seeds don't pop off the bagel so that's awesome.\n\nThe last egg & cheese sandwich I got was so enormous that I ate it for 2 meals. Plus the strawberry cream cheese is perfect. Just fresh Louisiana strawberries cut into creamy cheese....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\nMy only complaints are the limited hours (at the moment Thursday - Sunday / 7-11 only). I can't wait for them expand days and to lunch!",

  "text": "With so many restaurants in the area, it is hard to choose where would be the best place to grab a bite to eat. My husband and I ended up coming to Harp & Crown on a Friday, around 6:30 pm to catch the tail end of their happy hour (4-7 pm daily with rotating menu). Please note that happy hour is only available at the bar upstairs and the bar and lounge downstairs. It was rather crowded at the bar upstairs so my husband and I decided to check the lounge downstairs, which has a speak easy vibe. We were lucky to get a table and ended up ordering the following off the happy hour menu:\n\nHappy Hour Prime Rib Croquettes, $3 prior to tax- only comes with 3 in an order, the prime rib was good, just wished I had more. \n\nHappy Hour Cheesesteak Empanada, $3 prior to tax- Comes with 2 pieces, loved the meat and cheese filling inside. Definitely did taste like a cheesesteak. \n\nHappy Hour Arancini, $4 prior to tax- Served 4 rice balls and fried onions. I would pass on this dish, as the rice balls (aranchini) were bland and could do without. \n\nHappy Hour Lamb Meatballs, $5 prior to tax- Comes with 2 meatballs in a tasty sauce and 2 pieces of tasted bread. Love the meaty flavor of the lamb and would order this one again. \n\nHappy Hour Mac And Cheese, $5 prior to tax- This was a pretty good portion for the price but thought it was just average and would do without. \n\nHappy Hour Cheeseburger, $5 prior to tax- A good price for this size burger. Filling and the patty was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.\n\nHappy Hour Chicken Sandwich, $5 prior to tax- Another good purchase and great size for the price. Tasty fried chicken but does have a bit of a kick to it, so if you don't handle spicy well, they possibly opt out of it.\n\nHoney Do, $5 prior to tax- This cocktail reminded me of the melon, with a nice sweetness. \n\nHappy Hour Beer, $4 prior to tax\n----------------------------\n(Total= $42.30 after tax, prior to tip)\n\nOur server, Cory was great at taking good care of us. He was attentive, refilled our water glasses. I liked that he always checked up on us and made sure to let us know when it was last call (7 pm) in case we wanted to order more food or drinks. \n\nWhen we sat down at a small table, Cory cleaned our table with a disinfectant wipe. I really thought we would get ignored, but Cory was great. \n\nWhat makes this lounge unique is that there is a 2 lane bowling alley down here. It cost $100 for up to 8 people per lane. You can reserve the space here and have 2 dedicated servers to help take orders and attend to your group. If you don't make a reservation, then it is a first come/ first serve situation. \n\nHarp & Crown is definitely a great place to grab some drinks and some food off the happy hour menu (the restaurant itself is rather expensive so happy hour would be a great affordable option). Would come back if I lived around here.",

  "text": "Juan's offers great food at very reasonable prices.\n\nI have been to Juan's several times, but my last trip was by far the best. A buddy and I were looking for a lunch place and decided to go to Juan's at the last minute. Even though it was prime lunch time (12:00), the restaurant was busy, but not packed. We were promptly seated and our server immediately arrived to take our drink orders.\n\nThis level of service continued throughout our meal. Our server was attentive, but not overbearing.\n\nOn this trip I ordered the western burrito with steak. Imagine fajitas wrapped into a large burrito and you get the picture of what this entailed. It was wonderful. the steak, onions, peppers and cheese all combined to make a juicy and filling burrito. Fellow Yelper Shannon S.'s suggested I ask for the habanero hot sauce when ordering. i did, and I am glad. The sauce was hot, but flavorful. It really made the burrito even better. In fact, this may have been the best burrito I have had in the city so far.\n\nI really enjoy Juan's. If you're in the Garden District and looking for reasonable, good food, give Juan's a try.",

Back when I worked in Philly, this was a popular lunch choice for me - it was close by, fast, hearty food, tasty dishes.  But it's been 13 years since I left Philadelphia, so I thought a stroll down memory lane might be interesting.\n\nI ordered what was familiar - a pot pie with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  It came with a small piece of corn bread. Total = $8.  The surprise stand-out was the corn bread.  I could have foregone the whole meal just for the corn bread.  The pot pie was remarkably dull and flavorless.  The chicken in it was bland.  The mashed potatoes were forgettable.  The pasta in the mac and cheese swam in an orangey yellow ocean of cheesy soup.\n\nGod, I wish we had a Chick-Fil-A in Reno.",

So when I am in Tucson visiting family, I occasionally stop by this store for things I forgot to pack (be on on purpose or otherwise, haha)\n\nThis is the only Lush location in Tucson. It's on the small side, which makes navigating the store a bit difficult if there are other customers shopping. Thankfully the smaller store size does not seem to negatively impact the selection by much, I have always been able to find what I need when shopping here.\n\nLush stores always seem to have exceptionally sweet and knowledgable staff and this store is no exception, the employees have always been super helpful and never hesitate to give me generously sized samples when I ask.\n\nI highly recommend Lush products to anyone that cares about the environment, as well as anyone that is against animal testing, and anyone that would prefer to use natural substances over chemicals to clean their face, body and hair... as well as people that just like to smell great and pamper themselves. I am so happy Tucson has a Lush store now, I am sure I will be back!",

The Pagoda had lots of space to sit down and relax which was really nice in between trips to explore more food and drink. There were even a few VIP-exclusive vendors which was a really nice touch!

  "text": "You know what's really awkward?\n\nIt's awkward when you drive from the Northside of Indianapolis up into Fishers specifically for the reason of checking out a restaurant you're absolutely sure one of your friends has given a review review, then you get there, get seated, check-in to Yelp and finally check out your friend's review only to realize that they actually gave it a 1-star rating. \n\nD'oh. \n\nThe Nickel Plate Bar & Grill is a Fishers, Indiana bar and grill in a killer location in what is referred to as \"Old Town\" Fishers right alongside the former Nickel Plate railroad tracks. It's located in a building built in the 1880s and originally known as the Parks Place Saloon. \n\nSo yeah, it's kind of got the coolness factor. Nickel Plate is part of the Central Indiana restaurant group known as Lux Restaurants. It includes this place along with Blind Owl Brewery, Meridian Restaurant & Bar, Binkley's Kitchen& Bar, Elbow Room, and Broad Ripple Tavern. \n\nWhat do these places have in common? No silly, think beyond the whole \"bar and grill theme.\" Give up? \n\nThey, for the most part, kinda suck at wheelchair access and don't have the world's greatest parking (though Blind Owl and Meridian aren't too bad with parking). \n\nI mean, seriously, is Lux Hebrew for \"Keep out the gimps?\" \n\nI am slightly exaggerating, though I can definitely say that dining at Binkley's, Elbow Room and Broad Ripple Tavern can be difficult if you're in a wheelchair. In fact, I've specifically NOT dined at Binkley's on occasion because of their dreadful parking/access. Part of the problem lies in the fact that they tend to locate in older buildings. Thus, they are often exempt from accessibility requirements. \n\nDespite seeing the error of my ways AND the one-star rating, I'd always wanted to try this place and figured a day off from work was a good chance to check it out. \n\nFor the record, I still can't figure out how government employees get Good Friday off?\n\nParking around the area is a bit challenging, though likely less so if you're from the area and used to all the construction going on around the area. I'd ended up parking across the street by Taylor's Bakery, the Fishers location of one of my favorite bakeries, and just wheeled the couple of blocks. The sidewalks in the area are decent, though crossing the railroad tracks can be a bit challenging. So, wheeling it may not work for everyone in a wheelchair. \n\nI entered through a side door that had the only curb cut on the restaurant's sidewalk. It wasn't even close to ADA compliant, though it was pretty workable. The biggest concern is that spaces aren't real clearly marked and it's basically in a parking spot. Thus, it could easily be blocked. If so, there is no wheelchair access into the restaurant. \n\nOnce I got in the restaurant, you entered a small hosting area but today was a \"seat yourself\" day. I went through a small dining area to the left of the bar, then I went to what can be an open-air patio on warmer days. I'm always a bit leery of \"seat yourself\" in bars - service can be very spotty. However, it was spot-on today. I sat at a 4-top and Pearl, my server, arrived in a timely fashion. She took my drink order, the usual unsweetened iced tea, and dropped off a menu. While I'd heard about their tenderloin, named Indy's best by Indy Men's Magazine, I was in the mood for a burger and ordered The Amtrak. I ordered it medium-well, plain and with chips as a side. You can upgrade to fries for $.99. The entire bill came in at just over $10. \n\nThe burger was fresh and tasty, though I wouldn't call it particularly memorable. I enjoyed it, it was delivered as ordered, and I would order it again. The chips weren't anything special - I might upgrade to fries next time. They have a variety of other sandwich options, appetizers, soups and the bar. I didn't go near the bar, though it did look like it would have at least a couple accessible options for seating. I didn't have the problem with the food here that some others, including my friend (Rick G.), have had. The burger wasn't greasy. \n\nPearl was rock solid. She was friendly and attentive with multiple refills given including one right as I was paying the bill. I always love that. As I was leaving, even though she was by the bar she acknowledged my departure. That's a definite plus. \n\nIf I could go 3 1/2 stars, I probably would. The accessibility issues bothered me quite a bit and, as such, I can't imagine going higher than a 4-star review. The food was solid, though not memorable. Thus, I'm inclined to lean more toward three than four stars with the full awareness that I would definitely return. On this visit, the service was a highlight but I can definitely imagine their being some issues during busier times.",

So when I arrived, I decided that I would rather not sit in a mostly empty dining room on my own and I took a seat at the bar.\n\nOf course, they have Peroni in bottles so I ordered one of those while looking over the menu. I chose the caesar salad to start and the (handmade) ravioli with meatballs.\n\nThe salad was served in a chilled bowl with plenty of croutons and enough garlic to kill a battalion of vampires. Tasty.\n\nJust as the salad was finishing up, my large bowl of ravioli arrived. Lots of delicious Marinara sauce that scooped up nicely from the contents of the bread basket. The ravioli were quite tasty and nicely cooked to al dente. The meatballs were good, not great. A little tough but also quite tasty.\n\nI opted not to have dessert here.\n\nThis location is a little hard to find - go around the supermarket to the left and you'll find another building.",

My friends and I tend to come here to hang out on a Sunday afternoon! \n\nThere is tons of parking located at the mission. There is a huge parking lot but also street parking all around the mission.

What I received was a giant Italian sausage hoagie.  Although not what I expected it was fine.  Not great, but fine.  It was accompanied by wonderful fries.

  "text": "Oh man, Arnold's, I'm so glad I finally got a chance to come visit. Everyone was there when we walked in, families, hipsters, factory workers, definitely a cross section which usually is a good sign. \n\nWe showed up about an hour before closing but they still seemed pretty well stocked. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case. My sis initially wanted white meat fried chicken but all they had was dark. She got the catfish instead with the mashed and the greens instead. I jumped the gun with the veggies and got the mashed potatoes too-I should have asked what the corn beef hash looking stuff which turned out to be cajun potatoes. I got the roast beef, freshly sliced and got the au jus over it with extra au jus on my potatoes. My sister wished they gave her that option, since otherwise there was nothing else on her potatoes. I think the key with a place like this is to be willing to ask questions/options even if it may hold up the line a little bit, it's your food after all so why not?\n\nThe roast beef was delicious, moist, and the au jus over it. Delicious. The mac and cheese, also solidly good. The gf, the sis and myself all got it as a said and we were all happy with it. The special dessert that day was a chocolate pepper pie, which had a slightly spiced kick to the understated chocolate. If it shows up again, be sure to get it even if it might sound suspect.",

  "text": "This is an easy 5 star review for me.  I've been wanting to try the original Brew Bus since I moved to Tampa, unfortunately I havnt had the opportunity.  When Brew Bus opened up a store front, I couldn't wait to check it out.  I was so surprised when we pulled up. This place is huge, very nicely and neatly decorated and plenty of parking.  There is a nice long bar as well as cozy lounge area with nice couches and a projector on the wall.  \n\nThe beer list both home and guests are so intriguing.  Flights are offered but they do limit them to their own brews which is completely understandable.  It seemed as though they focus on small batches so I think they steer away from growlers.  \n\nThe entire staff is so warm and inviting.  We had the opportunity to chat with Matt, the GM, great conversation.  \n\nI really loved everything about this brewery and can't wait to return.  Definitely in my top 5 faves.",

  "text": "You can't come to New Orleans and not try some gumbo. I usually steer clear away from this dish at home in the D.C. area because I've had some truly awful gumbo, but I knew NOLA would not let me down. After grabbing some coffee across the street, we headed over to Gumbo Shop to try a few things. \n\nIt's a fairly large restaurant, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Our server was very friendly and engaged us with lively discussion about everything under the sun. It seemed, at first impression, a place that encapsulates the New Orleans spirit - both in terms of food and people.\n\nOur first order was an appetizer of chicken andouille gumbo. I was hooked on the first taste. The boneless chicken, andouille, okra, and all the right seasonings made my knees buckle. Our server told us that this dish is known for being the best gumbo in the city. \n\nWe then ordered entrees of red beans and rice with smoked sausage and the crawfish etouffee. Unfortunately, our server thought we chose the crawfish and pasta (penne pasta with crawfish tails and tasso in a reduced cream sauce). I didn't mind too much about the mix-up, although I would have liked to try the etouffee since it's a local favorite here. However since our server insisted that we ordered this dish (and it didn't seem likely that we were able to convince him otherwise) and it was already out on the table, I dug in. It was good, so no harm no foul. The red and beans with sausage was also very delicious. \n\nIt was the perfect first meal in New Orleans. I'm so glad we were able to have some classic gumbo while we were here.",

But Jahan Kabob proves that you can get interesting, high quality food at a fair price...even out in Bucks County.\n\nChicken chapli, beef seekh, lamb tikka, all bold flavored and delicious. I haven't tried everything but I'm sure the rest of their kabob menu is great as well. Special shout out for the deep fried cauliflower. This stuff is outstanding and it's f'ing cauliflower! I have to say, it's usually hard to get excited about cauliflower, but there you have it. It's a must try.\n\nJahan is one of my favorite restaurants in PA so far. Five stars.",

  "text": "This was the first stop on our night out in St. Louis. We stopped by another bar called Lush and it was empty. We asked the valet guys at Lush \"where do all the fun people go? not the posers\". They suggested we go to Lucas Park Grille. Good suggestion.\n\nThey had some kind of a special on sparkling wine and we ended up ordering bottle service. Our server Tabitha was awesome. She came back frequently to fill our glasses and chatted with us. We asked her to suggest an appetizer and she recommended the mini sliders made with Kobe beef. Excellent suggestion. The mini-sliders came with sweet potato fries. Delicious!!\n\nWe went back the next day for lunch. I ordered the smoked chicken sandwich with sun dried tomatoes. My partner got the prime burger and our friends got a tilapia blt and the burger. All dishes came with fries sprinkled with shaved parmesan cheese. Fabulous. \n\nThe food is good. The only inconsistency was the fries. My friend's fries were cold and tasted stale. Our fries were fine. \n\nThe crowd is very typical for an upscale restaurant minus the diversity. I was the only colored person on premises on both days. it doesn't matter to me, just an observation. There was a sea of blond hairdos. \n\nThe outside seating area, although not open, looks beautiful. I bet it will be a nice place to sit and have a drink once the weather gets warm. \n\nThe service on both days was impeccable. Both our servers were cheerful, pleasant, and professional. Overall, a fun place to eat and drink with friends.",

  "text": "3.5 stars if I could...\n\nCafé Conti is a little restaurant inside of the Prince Conti hotel. With four stars and over five hundred reviews I knew it had to be a quality place. The service is a little iffy, but the food is fire.\n\nThe inside of the café is kind of tiny, but both times I'd gone during my trip to New Orleans there was no wait to be seated, however, when we visited the second time, the waiter was telling people, \"it'll be ten minutes before I'll get to you.\" That I thought was extremely odd. They did seem understaffed, but it wasn't that unmanageable in my opinion. The first visit I thought the service in general was a little on the slow side, now I see why. They like throttle their service like my ATT does with my data plan.\n\nAnother thing to note- soda refills (tea included) are not free. I wondered why they didn't necessarily ask me for a refill because once I saw the check I paid $6 for two drinks.\n\nMy first meal I had was the Croque Madame which was out of this world. A huge piece of sourdough with ham and Swiss, bechemel and a sunny side up egg on top of it all. Side of potatoes came with it but you could do grits or fruit if you'd like. Second meal was a crepe. Have to do at least one crepe, right? I got their chocolate and strawberry crepe and it was so decadent. I shared unwillingly with my friend. It was the perfect size for the price. You'd might want to split it with someone, I didn't want to , but I did anyway.\n\nI thought the prices overall, aside from the refill thing, were reasonable.\n\nRestrooms are located in the hotel, not in the restaurant.\n\nWe had to get our check from the counter when we visited because the servers did take too long. It's a place you'll enjoy if you're not in a hurry for sure. The food makes sure for the lack of service absolutely.",

  "text": "I think I misunderstood what this place was going to be.  I had in my mind a charming bed and breakfast, when in reality it is more of an upscale motel offering several unique amenities.  With easily more than 50 rooms available, it couldn't possibly have the charm of someone's Victorian home and carriage house.  But not all was lost.  The rooms were clean and rather standard.  A swimming pool and whirlpool were available for guests.  Additionally a free DVD library and free bike rentals were available.  The breakfast was a basic continental offering.  However, in the afternoons and early evenings, things picked up considerably.  From 4:30pm to 6:30pm they offer free wine and cheese.  They had two large decanters filled with house red and house white wines respectively.  These were available alongside a plentiful selection of Camembert and crackers.  From 6:30pm to 8:30pm they had milk and cookies.  The cookies were pretty good and included oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, macadamia nut, and peanut butter.  During the day they also put out a selection of coffees, teas, and snacking cookies.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.  I also enjoyed the free wi-fi and the use of a small refrigerator in my room which was perfect for chilling champagne.  The drawbacks were the lack of intimacy and the motel feel to the inn.  Rack rates varied during my stay but were between $135.09-$158.20 per night.  \n\n\n3.5 stars",

Wait was about 40mins, we were given a pager and was told we can walk the marina. \n\nBeautiful day, busy with families and couples and fishermen. Sat on a bench and enjoyed the sun and the view. \n\nFast forward to 40mins, pager buzzed and we were seated outdoor on their patio. \n\nAppetizers: 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell ($9.95) and calamari. Oysters were clean and not too big, served with marinara and horseradish. Probably the cheapest we've come across all weekend in SB. Calamari was perfectly battered, served with dipping sauce (I think some kind of Cajun). You can taste the freshness. \n\nMain course: crab cakes and seafood pasta. BOMB! I was already getting full from our appetizers that I was only able to finish one crab cake, the other one would be my snack for later. Seafood pasta included shrimp, scallops, clams, squid, embedded in fettuccini. DEE-LISH-USSS!! \n\nDrinks: bf had kona coffee (had liquor) and this was served warm, he liked it but asked for a glass of ice and preferred it cold. I had a Stella Artois FTW. \n\nOverall great food and experience except the part where an angry hostile seagull kept thing to fly in to snatch our bread. He came about 5x in the beginning of our meal so that kinda had us nervously eating our meal. Otherwise still enjoyed the beautiful view on the patio! Go, go, go!",

  "text": "Sport's Pizza is located at the end of Makefield Road, just before it reaches Woolston Avenue in Morrisville, Pa.  It is far off the street in a dated strip center behind a gas station. It is very easy to miss, as I did the first time through.  It is a small shop with 6 booths, and clearly deals primarily in take away.  They have a wall of pizza boxes at the ready.  \n\nI was there for a light meal to replace the dinner I was too late to prepare at home.  I saw a handwritten sign that they had chicken noodle soup as a special, which piqued my interest on a chilly night.  Walking in and chatting with the woman at the register, I learned that the Brooklyn Pie was a new item.  There were a couple of squares left in the display, and I went for the corner slice to maximize the crunchy crust.  I also asked for a bowl of the soup.  Both were under $5.  \n\nI like my tomato pie well done, and asked for that.  It arrived on paper plate before the soup (?), not as hot as it should have been, but still warm enough to satisfy my desire for a hot meal.  I don't understand why some places can't handle requests for well done (reheated) pizza, and insist that everyone wants it the same less than optimal temperature.  Still, I recognized that the crust was done decently, and the sauce/cheese ratio was fine.  Nice touch to see a sprig of basil.  I've had better. \n\nThe soup was another matter.  It was very hot (microwave reheat), with lots of chicken, veggies and a few noodles, in a nice mild bird bouillon. A shake of black pepper and I was in business.  I liked it a lot. Enough to remember to order it again when in the vicinity. \n\nI enjoyed sitting down next to a poster of Allen Iverson.  I would love a real meal with him to talk about his election to the Basketball Hall of Fame and what an awesome basketball warrior he was.",

This particular location is pretty big. \n\nFOOD:\nChopped Salad - Chopped iceberg, tomatoes and crispy prosciutto with their house dressing. I was surprised at how tasty their house dressing is, not tangy at all. The prosciutto gave the salad a nice salty balance. Got the bleu cheese on the side cause that's a yuck for me. \n\nCalamari Fritters - Tentacle & ring portions, yes!  The breading was a bit heavy but the flavor was good. Comes with marinara sauce for dipping. The portion is huge, even for 3 of us. \n\nChef KB's Lobster Carbonara - They were out of lobster but substituted it with crab which was totally fine. The amount of crab was very generous. The pasta was cooked nicely and the cream sauce was tasty and not heavy. Came topped with fresh & crispy snap peas and bacon crumble. Delish!  I wish I didn't eat so much calamari and salad because I couldn't finish it. \n\nSERVICE:\nWalked in without reservations at 6:45pm on a Monday and got seated immediately. The last booth we got was next to the kitchen so it was like watching a server's marathon. Our server Mike was great. Very friendly & professional. It was restaurant week in Philly so they were packed. All the servers were buzzing around the entire time. \n\nOVERALL:\nA totally nice surprise of a restaurant. The food was great, prices good for the portion received and got good service. I wish they'd open in Hawaii instead of Olive Garden!",

Cool artwork on the walls and even some vinyl to sift through. Very reminiscent of breweries in Brooklyn (minus the prices).

My review is just for the Bourbon part of this location, as I did not use the Barber aspect.\n\nThe bar is located on one side of the room, with tables to sit at, or stand at, and seats at the bar.  A couple of televisions hang on the wall behind the bar. The barbershop aspect is on the other side of the room, with a dividing wall between the two sections. They have an excellent patio area out back, with string lights overhead, plenty of relaxed seating areas, and fire features they put on after dark.  The have a nice big parking lot, so parking should never be an issue.\n\nWe sat at the bar and were taken care of by \"J\", who, although not a gin fan, completely knew her cocktails.  I started with one of their specialty cocktails called Young Gerald's Apple Hooch. Delicious!  Made with moonshine and cider, I loved the sweet flavor. I was just a bit disappointed it didn't have the brûléed apple slice - apparently they were out of apples: you know, the easiest fruit to buy, anywhere. My next selection was the cucumber gimlet, served up. This too was perfectly made and delicious.\n\nThey don't serve food, however they have a permanent food truck located on the side of the building serving up tostones with toppings of chicken, pork, or seafood, and mofongo.  Keep in mind that craft cocktails do take time to make, so you will probably have a small wait.  They also offer an interesting draft assortment, which they do offer happy hour specials on.",

Happy hour goes until 7 p.m. Don't look at the online happy hour menu; it's out of date.\n\nI understand there's a new chef at Modesto: http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2012/03/modestos_new_chef_selects_spri.php\n\nThere was a mandarin orange sangria special. Not being one for sweet drinks, I asked for a taste. Perfectly accommodated. It was fine and dandy, so I got one.\n\nOther dining partners got the same sangria and a mellow cab.\n\nOur server was fabulous, and water was replenished perfectly!\n\nFor food: At happy hour in the bar (ONLY) there are one- or two-bite hors d'oeuvres for 75 cents to $2. We had from the happy hour menu:\n\ngrilled shrimp with aoli (perfect)\n\nmussel that had a fabulous lemon-infused breading (I had two; could have had 10)\n\nchicken liver mousse on a toasted baguette (fabulous; I had two)\n\nchickpea puree with Manchego cheese on a toasted baguette (I'd pass on this next time)\n\nbleu-cheese-stuffed Gordal olive (It was hot -- temperature-wise, and I wasn't expecting that; not desirable)\n\nchorizo corn dogs (I didn't try)\n\nSadly, gone from the happy menu were the stuffed mushrooms, pork and veal meatballs, trout-stuffed red peppers with onion and caper, and bacon-wrapped dates with cabreles cheese.\n\nFrom the regular menu we got:\nFlamenquines de Lomo de Res: grilled beef tenderloin rolls with mushrooms (three to the serving)  $9 -- addicting\n\nlovely ensalada mixta: red onion, almonds, Manchego cheese and fried garlic with sherry vinaigrette (we got the dressing on the side) -- $7 --  that was huge even for three people on a beautiful triangle plate (I could have put it in my purse.)\n\nPapas Rellenas: potato croquettes stuffed with Cabrales cheese, almonds and olives -- $6 -- I'd pass on those next time\n\nWe each had one drink, and our total for the three was $67. I guess we ate a lot of food. I was stuffed.",

  "text": "Five stars for two words: Bada Bing! \n\nThis \"Chef's Selection\" entree was ordered as an appetizer, which is a very clever way for the whole table to get in on the act (Good job Mom!). For you see, the \"Cavatelli Bada Bing\" is prepared table side (for a video, head to the URL - It's on the \"Menus\" page). It's hard to find the words to describe this one-of-a-kind creation, but just imagine fresh pasta, flambeed with vodka, then dumped INTO a huge wheel of Parmesan cheese (to soften it). While it's softening, prosciutto, basil, tomatoes and a touch of red pepper (\"To open the taste buds\") are also flambeed. Now the pasta, and a generous portion of the softened cheese, are scrapped from the wheel and mixed with the prosciutto. Absolutely fantastic. On this dish alone 5 stars were in the bag, only a disaster would keep this review from a perfect score. Do note that this a very rich dish, and I personally think it would be way too much as a main, but I do think it is absolutely perfect as an antipasti. \n\nOK, so now onto the rest of the meal, which was also quite good. \n\nCesar salad + Pizza Biancaneve (a white pizza), a lasagna bolognese, a Spinach salad + the Calamari appetizer as a main, and for me the Rigatonacci alla Vodka with the Wedding Soup as a side (vs. a salad). None of these dishes disappointed, though the lasagna, clearly in a baked dish, was just barely above warm. If mom was not so hungry, I think she would have sent it back. \n\nService was very refined. Very nice dining environment. I was also told there are some good early bird specials (Mom & Bob like to see an early movie at Baywalk and then have dinner here).\n\nNote: There are lunch and dinner hours. Lunch ends at 4PM, and then it's dinner. There's no break in the action, just (I suspect) a menu change. \n\nPS. Some outdoor seating via tables on the sidewalk, but I think the weather would have to be perfect (with no chance of rain), to make it enjoyable.",

The sticker was one of many pathetically bad attempts to connect with an audience and, only appropriate that I got to remove it.  Why? Well, I have intimate knowledge of that mess of a station and some of the horrendous decisions made there both by New York management and a former Bucs defensive lineman who should never appear on any radio or TV show.",

  "text": "It was a cloudy afternoon in Tampa Bay. My brother Johnny and I were in the mood for Yummy House as I had been hearing raves about it for a while now, (they say its better than Tasty Wok!) But to our disappointment, Yummy House was closed that afternoon (I think the family went on a vacation to China for a few weeks?)\n\nSo off we went down the street to China Yuan, the next best Chinese place on the list.\n\n\nLocated in a small strip mall typical in these parts of Tampa, China Yuan belies its gritty exterior where inside is a rather large, clean, and most importantly, authentic Chinese restaurant deriving from the Cantonese traditions.\n\n\nWe ordered three dishes, all reasonably priced and all in very large portions. The first dish to arrive was the seafood tofu hot pot, a rather fresh seafood tofu pot with steaming tofu, squid, vegetables, and succulent shrimp. The dish was delicious and ranks up there among the better seafood tofu hot pots, though not \"the\" best. The second dish was the salt and pepper squid, a plate with large pieces of savory squid spiced with salt and pepper, fried to a crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Also a commendable dish. The last to come was another huge plate: the orange beef, double fried in a tangy sweet and sour sauce and all in all a great dish.\n\nAlthough we didn't get to visit Yummy House and try them out, China Yuan wasn't too bad for a replacement. If this place was in Orlando, it would probably be among the top five Chinese places (though that's not saying much due to the lack of abundantly good Chinese places around Orlando)\n\n\n\nfor photos of my food from china yuan!\nhttp://tastychomps.blogspot.com/2010/06/china-yuan-tampa-florida.html",

I shared with him, my typical likes and dislikes and he magically created a flight that was to my liking. \n\nWhat makes Gezellig unique to other beer bars, is the variety. It's impressive that you can not only enjoy a cold draft beer, but you can go to the coolers and select a bottle or can to enjoy as well.

It's Chinatown.\"\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cWnubJ9CEw]\n\nPhilly has a lot of food festivals, but the once-a-month, summertime, mobile Night Market is definitely a must-do.  This episode, 4 Oct 2012, was a return to Chinatown (last there in Oct 2011), a cross of food trucks, tents and tables centered on the intersection of N 10th and Race streets (where David's Mai Lai Wah is located).  By my count 55 food vendors, as smattering of arts & craft, public services, and some music and street performers.\n\nChinatown is the perfect place for NM, because you can also take advantage of the many stores that stay open late (NM runs 7-11PM).  Although I do wonder if their business improves or not?  Did anyone try to get into Hop Sing Laudromat?  Just curious how crowded it was.\n\nWe enjoyed:\n\nKa'Chi (Korean)--Always a long line, which is a good sign, but I was underwhelmed by the Kimbap (Korean maki roll; $5)\n\nLil' Pop Shop (popsicles)--My first time, very tasty, although as everyone says, small and expensive ($3)\n\nLocal 215 (locavore)--A must-try, the short rib on creamy polenta ($7) was large, filling, and one of the highlights of the night\n\nLos Taquitos de Puebla (Mexican)--Tacos al Pastor, 3 tasty softshells, ask for the spicy red sauce ($8)\n\nPhiladelphia Distillery--White whiskey + ginger beer ($6) was pretty potent, there was a long line which I somehow didn't notice and got away with cutting right to the front!  Sorry!\n\nQT Vietnamese Sandwich (or was this Vietname Restaurant?)--Tofu Banh Mi ($5), hard to believe but my first ever Banh Mi (I don't get out much?), this was super tasty and my favorite dish of the evening\n\nZea May's (Native American)--Sweet potato empanada ($5), not that exciting, and a sangria lemonade (no EtOH)\n\nI was excited to try Matt Levin's Square Peg, but I'm sorry dude, your fried drumsticks just looked too boring (although the DJ and light show was appreciated)\n\nSome dishes were large, others were not, but as you can see, the prices can add up.  However, lot of fun and a good place to meet a group and graze your way up and down on the street.  But take my advice and get there at 6:30PM (many of the vendors start selling before 7PM) because it gets super croweded as the evening goes on, and some of the lines get ridiculous (25 min for that Kimbap was definitely not worth it).\n\nSadly, this is the last Night Market for 2012, so we'll have to wait for next summer...\n\nParking was easy in one of the many open-air lots along Vine St, which offer discounted $6 parking for NM.\n\nSláinte!",

  "text": "Like most places in Trenton, this has a tough exterior but it is a completely different place as soon as you step inside. It feels like a place where you can celebrate your Sweet 15 or just come in for a casual date. The restaurant is very spacious and has a chic modern feel inside. Everything is very clean and the service is friendly. I have come a few times and always enjoy my meal. \n\nThe meals served are various Costa Rican dishes and regular American ones as well. My favorite is the fried snapper fish, it is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I also love the plate that most resembles a Colombian bandeja paisa - beans, rice, plantains and meat. Overall, I have not had a bite of something I did not like here.\n\nThey also have a full bar and make a really good margarita. At night the one side turns into a lounge and the parking lot gets super full. Pura vida is really a great place to go for an excellent meal, that is reasonably priced. Oh and they have huge TVs playing sports games as well - Sunday Funday with Soccer!",

This Doubletree is in city center and if you stay on one of the top floors, it's a great view of City Hall and the historic buildings of the city. It's also an easy walk to tons of restaurants, bars, and shopping. The hotel rooms are clean and big, but my favorite part of any Doubletree Hotel is the free chocolate chip cookie they give you when you check in (The secret is that they give you one any time you ask so I had 5 during my one night stay). So amazing! The staff here are also very helpful. Warning: Parking can be pricey here, but the cheapest option we found within walking distance was Latimer Garage.",

It seems most people go with a burger or sandwich situation here, which is what my two friends and I did. I got the fried chicken sandwich which was really good...I loved the pickles. My friend ordered the lamb burger which seemed interesting. \nI would not recommend the mixed drinks unfortunately. My friend ordered a margarita which a) came in the wrong glass (maybe I'm picky, but why not put it in a margarita glass?) and b) was mainly sour mix.

I went with a friend and we shared the artichoke fries appetizer, the brussel sprouts, the cauliflower steak, and the mushroom risotto. We also each got a glass of Charlie's punch. \n\nEverything was excellent and plated so beautifully. I was surprised at how tasty the artichoke was because I'm not usually a fan of the vegetable. I thought the brussel sprouts had great flavor and I liked the sweetness of the grapes and pomegranate seeds juxtaposed against the savoriness of the brussel sprouts. I think my favorite of the night was the risotto though! It was surprisingly creamy and so delicious. I definitely did not miss dairy or meat products after my meal, but I was still quite hungry - which was disappointing given the hefty price tag of our meal ($76 for two excluding tip). \n\nFinal gripe: I don't know why they sat us in the corner near the prep area in the back with all of the empty tables available - my chair kept getting knocked around by the waiters rushing around and it was quite uncomfortable. \n\nI'd definitely recommend making reservations before arriving. I'm not from Philly, but apparently places will tell you that they have a 1-2 hour wait even if they have a ton of empty seats. Not sure what kind of ploy this is, but doesn't really mesh well with me. Parking in the area is also difficult to find and lots are quite pricey.

This entrance-statement has probably even been said before.\n\nI *can* yak about your wonderful Restaurant Week deal. I can tell everyone that I had one of the best meals of my entire life here. I can even reiterate the fact that when I got home last night, I didn't move an inch for a good hour.\n\nLast night was like Yelp-night at Zahav, I tell you. There were several of us spread around the restaurant without actually planning it out that way. At our table, fellow Yelper Ashley S. and I were mind-blown by the amount of food given to us -- despite seeing the reviews ahead of time. This may have been the longest meal of my life, having clocked in at 2.5 hours.\n\nFirst there was the salatim and hummus and laffa bread. I loved the beets especially. Then came the cauliflower, chicken that tasted like Christmas, grape leaves, and haloumi. After that, I had the ribeye -- medium rare, as they suggested. Chocolate mousse for dessert.\n\nOh, and also a Desert Rose (gin) cocktail. Always the gin.\n\nServers were super professional and ready to swoop in with fresh plates and silverware (and also boxes...) when we were done each course. The manager was also very friendly. He asked me where I purchased my change purse since it was clearly Turkish. When he said, \"I hope to see you again,\" I awkwardly replied, \"You too,\" instead of \"Thank you,\" and I'm not even ashamed, because I must go back. They even gave a $10 off return coupon. \n\nSo really. I will return. Who wants to go? I'm serious.",

  "text": "I had a big bunch of limits from various family members for Easter Sunday lunch and the Peppermill fit the bill. We made reservations (a must for a busy day like Easter) a few days before and were seated promptly. Easter had a limited menu but there were easily enough selections to keep us all happy. \n\nSundays have the dinner menu at lunch time which is really appropriate since this is a *very* old school restaurant. Old but solid. All 5 of us were very pleased with our meals. I loved that the salad dressing are made in house. And we had the veal with seafood, the redfish almondine and the stuffed crabs. We didn't peruse the wine list or order drinks so not really sure about that.\n\nThis spot does offer 3 meals a day so that's unusual for an independent spot and my brother has been here for breakfast meetings and says the food is good. \n\nWe also sampled the desserts; a carrot cake - cheesecake, caramel custard and lemon meringue pie. All were delicious.\n\nThe server was on point. The food came out quickly and the tables turned over quickly, despite that we were in a room with a table set up for groups of 20.",

  "text": "Voodoo BBQ is a tasty little fast food BBQ joint on St. Charles Ave. in New Orleans. It's located right outside the CBD, so it's easy to get to if you're in that area and want a quick bite to eat. Locals love the place, so there's generally a line, but it's never too long, and it moves fairly quickly. To me, the food is delicious, but each time I've been to VooDoo, I've been disappointed by the portion sizes. For example, their sides comes served in small styrofoam containers, and I'm always longing for just a little bit more of their tasty corn pudding or Gris Gris Greens. The same goes for their meat portions. I've tried and enjoyed their sausage links, brisket, and pulled pork... but my question is always, \"Where's the Beef?\" VooDoo is located close to my brother's house, so I return there again and again when I'm at my brother's house and needing a quick bite ... but I'm always still hungry after dining there.",

I was pretty excited to eat here since a few neighbors had mentioned that they did good work and because Asian food in Bucks County is exhaustingly lackluster. \n\nAfter checking out their menu we decided to go with the fried tofu satay app which comes stuffed with cucumbers and bean sprouts and a topped with peanut sauce, the clay pot vegetable curry and the beef chow fun. I liked the tofu app alot. It was nice and crispy, and obviously fresh out of the fryer. Just perfect. The curry was super spicy and absolutely delicious. The portion was tremendous, easily enough for 2 or 3. My kids ate most of the chow fun but the few tastes I had were really nice. How can you not love those huge chow fun noodles?\n\nPricing was pretty reasonable, I think it came to 40 bucks for all 3 dishes. The service was good too. They checked on us constantly and had a good time joking with the kids. Really nice people. \n\nAll in all this is a great spot for Malaysian food. I would definitely go back anytime.",

  "text": "I think NashHouse Southern Spoon and Saloon is alright. It's very close to my Nashville office, so I have visited for lunch while there. I haven't been blown away by any part of the experience, but it's convenient, and not terrible, so it's likely I'll be back. \n\nOn my most recent visit with a co-worker we opted to sit outside, because the weather was nice. Perhaps it's due to the fact that we were outside, but our service wasn't great. The restaurant definitely wasn't busy during our visit, so this was a bit frustrating. Our table was also very lopsided, and though we pointed this out we weren't given the option to move, though we were the only two people sitting outside. \n\nI ordered a Coke and opted for the Grilled Catfish Tacos, which were served with pickled vegetables, white bbq sauce, and avocado, and they came with a side of fries. The food was pretty good, but it wasn't anything special. I struggled getting my drink refilled, which goes back to the service issues we were experiencing. \n\nOverall, I'd say if you're in the area and looking for a lunch or dinner spot, I think there are likely better options around than NashHouse.",

  "text": "Well I expected more from the Broad Street Diner - a lot more.  My first time eating there was not memorable.  Mainly because the service was very poor.  We had a waitress who took her time, delivered mixed-up orders, never checked back to see if we needed anything (which I did), and never refilled water glasses.  And the food was average at best.  The house salad had little taste - primarily due to the bland blue cheese dressing.  The pork roll sandwich with cheese and egg was decent enough except for the fact that on the menu it was supposed to come with french fries and cole slaw.  Instead what I got was a pile of the shredded type of home fries which was totally without crunch or flavor.  The waitress couldn't be found to change to the right order so I just let it go.  When I heard another table near to us complain that they too didn't get french fries with their sandwich, I finally got the attention of the waitress who still took almost 10 minutes to come to our booth to tell her the same thing had happened to me. She told me the home fries I was served are what come with my order.  Well not according to the menu!  None of these errors were the result of being busy. There were only four tables occupied in the whole place.  In the land of great diners, this one does not stand out.",

It was nice to have a head start on what was to be a full house at Full Moon.  \n\nClayton, our host and server had his act together and brought all of us coffee as we perused the breakfast menu.  Various omelets for my family and friend, and French Toast for me.  While the conversation gathered momentum, the plates were brought out and laid before us.  Everything looked very good, although I only tasted the homemade Potato Chips, which were good.\n\nMy French Toast was off the mark, however. I had asked for it \"crunchy,\" and was told it would be left on the grill longer to make it all well done.  What came out with the real Maple Syrup were a half dozen pieces of French Demi Loaf that were actually lukewarm at best, and far from the cauterized ends I requested.  I was surprised given the repartee at the ordering.  They had not been on the grill long enough, and had been off the grill too long before serving. Wrong on both sides.  Disappointing, but not wanting to poop on the party I ate everything and enjoyed the real Maple Syrup. \n\nMy mates were satisfied, and the gestalt of the room was pleasing. \n\nThree out of four ain't bad.",

I've had snow cones and Hawaiian shaved ice before, but I had no idea what a New Orleans Style Snoball was.  I have to say that I really liked it.  The ice is shaved into extremely tiny and thin pieces.  That's a good thing because you don't have to wait for big chunks to melt in your mouth before you can continue eating.  They have some toppings you can choose from that you wouldn't normally see at a snow cone place, such as marshmallow fluff and whipped cream.  You can also get sugar free flavors.  They also have several selections that are more than one flavor of syrup mixed together.  I just went with grape syrup only.  While I liked how it tasted it was almost too sweet for me.  Kids would probably love it though.\n\nThe \"cash only\" sign was a downer.

The seared scallops and prosciutto appetizer (sesame vinaigrette gave it a tangy yet nutty twist) was wonderful, as were the mussels in red sauce (slightly spicy giving them an extra bite).  The bucatini amatriciana (hollow spaghetti with pancetta and tomato, topped with Romano) was very bold and slightly spicy - the pasta was very tender and the Romano complemented the tomato-based sauce perfectly without making the dish too cheesy.  The gnocchi was a perfect blend of spice and cream, with rock shrimp as an addition.  I had the skate wing braised with caper butter, which was delicously creamy, and tried the pork loin, which was succulent and flavorful (topped with gorgonzola).  The panna cotta was very rich and creamy.  I was stuffed but had to finish it because it was that good.  For the appetizer, pasta, entree, and dessert, it was ~$33/person.

I actually preferred the Thai wings based on their flavor. Neither had that much heat to be honest.\n\nOutside the buffet, they also have a huge menu (about as huge as the interior which has at least 4 rooms I could see), with the standard wings, real burgers and regular American fare.\n\nWhile not a weekly stop, I could see Quaker steak being a great Friday lunch once a month when you want to gorge.",

The current exhibition is Dehaan Artist of Distinction Group Exhibition that is running from Sept. 3 - October 29, 2021. Included artists are painter Mason Archie, photographer Eric Lubrick, multidisciplinary artist Samuel Levi Jones, and papel picado inspired artist Beatriz Vazquez. \n\nThis is a relatively small but inviting space that's open 10am-4pm from Tuesday-Friday and by appointment. They are following CDC guidelines and recommendations. \n\nThe gallery offers free parking across the street in the Lucille Raines parking lot. There's also metered parking along Pennsylvania. Occasionally, you can get lucky and find free spots along 9th Street.\n\nThe gallery is also on an IndyGo route and it's adjacent to Indy's Cultural Trail. \n\nOn a budget of less than $2,000 annually, Gallery 924 puts on 10 exhibitions annually empowering mid-career and established artists. The gallery is a participant in the Indianapolis Downtown Artists and Dealer's Association First Friday Art Tour. Even when the gallery doors are closed, Gallery 924 is working to promote Central Indiana's artists. \n\nI honestly loved this little space. It's not the fanciest gallery you'll find, but the energy is positive and the love for artists is obvious. I look forward to returning.",

They offer three courses, plus dessert, and drinks via their a la carte menu.  As I've always preferred a variety of food versus a huge portion of one dish when dining out, their type of menu plays to my preferences.  \n\nWe each began with a cocktail and first.  I cannot recall the name of my cocktail, but you'll know it as the one with tequila, watermelon, and a chilli pepper spice.  The spice was not overpowering, but did help ensure I didn't down the drink in one go!  As for our firsts, we shared the beets and corn + truffle custard.  The beet salad came with a cashew butter that helped balance the ingredients.  The custard appeared simple and straight forward, but after tasting I realized it had 'a lot going on' with bits of mushroom and tomato.\n\nInstead of each ordering a second, we split the heirloom tomato.  Like the previous salad, it was well assembled and presented.  I could share more notes, but it went down so quickly!\n\nWe ended the savory dishes by sharing the culotte steak and pork coppa.  I was surprised just how well the blueberry paired with the pork and black garlic chips that came with the steak ensure each bite was excellent.  No worries about temperature as they were both cooked perfectly.\n\nWe ended the night with dessert, including a well place candle arranged by Nataly N.  Their olive oil cake was rather simple but nonetheless delicious.  The panna cotta was smooth and very easy to enjoy.\n\nTo round out my review, I can touch on service and atmosphere.  It was easy to say service was amazing.  Prompt coverage without interrupting our alone time.  Greeting smiles with great recommendations. On atmosphere, yes the dining area was very basic.  However, it was also very bright and filled with natural light as we dined just before sundown.  I feel it helped us be ourselves and feel comfortable while enjoying our fine dining we didn't need to lift a finger to prepare...",

Its so interesting to see how the the styles, technology, and even the use of color changed over the decades.\n\n Indianapolis 500 winning cars? Yeah they had thirty of them.\n\nThey also had many display cases with cool exhibits, a trophy room, and a room with dozens of engines to look at if you're a gear head. \n\nOh, and you can squeeze your way into an Indy car for a sweet souvenir photo.\n\nVroom vroom, baby!",

Impressive menu.\n\nFirst visit was a turkey and bacon club sandwich and it was beautiful to look at and tasted of equal quality. Just the right amount of meat and the bacon was definitely made fresh and really crisp. (The only bacon I've had better the last month is the special kind Doc B's at International Mall puts in front of me while drinking at the bar.)\n\nI returned for a breakfast sandwich, which they make no matter the time of day, and enjoyed it immensely. \n\nThen returned a week later for \"The Hammer.\" It is an advertised special at the counter and combines steak with salami and thousand island. While it is a small upcharge to add ingredients like tomato and pickles, it was the best sandwich I have had yet although next time I want to do it on toasted sliced bread instead of a bun.\n\nNice employees too. I can see everything is made to order right behind the counter.\n\nNow, if only they would update the Eagles jersey featuring Terrell Owens on the wall. Perhaps go throwback with a Harold Carmichael or Wilbert Montgomery in the kelly green back from the NFC Championship Coach Vermeil days? As we Cowboys fans always said about those teams, \"Dick Vermeil...before he dicks you.\"",

  "text": "Ever notice that little gazebo on the hill just off the S. Virginia Street exit of 395? Well I had many times, and I'd often wonder what it was doing up there. Is it part of someone's backyard? Is it one of those random structures left in the Nevada backcountry for weary travelers? Did someone get married up there and just leave it? I wanted to know but I'd never really tried that hard to find out. \n\nBut then, as fortune would have it, I moved into a new neighborhood and I discovered a really nice park, some short hiking trails, and great views of South Reno and benches to enjoy them from! The gazebo itself is actually pretty cool and a picnic underneath it on a nice day is a great idea! I guess it wasn't as mysterious as I'd once thought. It's just a gazebo on a hill for people to enjoy, and that's enough purpose I suppose. \n\nBut In my quest to find the gazebo, I discovered an \"amphitheater\" that looks to have been there for years. It's a number of concrete slabs arranged symmetrically in a v-shape pattern, resting high up on the hill. I have no idea how it got there, or what force of nature might have created it, but my guess is aliens! How else could something that big and heavy get up there? \n\nOn each of my walks now I look for clues on the hillside. Someday I'll crack the case. Someday...",

This location had a fantastic cover band playing Saturday night (IPD - check them out, they were really amazing).  I drank and danced my fool ass off.  The crowd was really friendly (may have been my new jeans, or my drunken dance floor gyrations, but still).\nWe sat at the outside patio bar for a while - I always forget that people smoke cigarettes in other states so that took a little getting used to.  Our bartenders remained attentive the whole time we sat there ringing up a $130 tab.  And that's just what we spent outside before going inside to dance and drink some more!!!  My drinks were only $4.50 or $5 a pop, apparently depending on whether or not you pay with cash or credit, or maybe it depends on the bartender that charges you.  Hard to tell.  In any case, I take very little responsibility for wracking up that bar tab.  And when friends insist that you take shot after wretched shot, it only makes sense that they buy the damn things, so there.  Be prepared to severely damage your hearing if you decide to head inside for the band.  I really doubt such a tiny place needs such a wickedly huge sound system, especially when the dance floor is the same space where the band plays, sandwiched between the door and the bar.\nOutside bar tab = $130 before tip\nInside bar tab = $100(ish) before tip\nWatching my Aussie friend sing AC/DC songs with the band?

I love to OD on MSG every once and a while so I stopped in to check this place out.  \n\nThis used to be the Old Country Buffet and the new folks didn't change it much.  Like most Chinese buffets the atmosphere is nothing special.  Of course you didn't come here to admire the décor but to eat yourself into a stupor! \n\nI stopped by for a weekday lunch and the tab was $8.59 + $1.99 for an unlimited soft drink for a total with tax of $11.21.  That is very typical buffet  pricing for this area.\n\nI was impressed by the cleanliness here.  The restaurant itself was spotless and the men's restroom was immaculate.  Sorry ladies but I didn't check the women's bathroom.  I wasn't in the mood for all the yelling and screaming that was likely to ensue!\n\nThe wait staff was fine.  My soda was refilled and my plates were whisked away with no problems.  I even received a nice smile and a thank you as I prepared to leave.\n\nSo what about the food? You need to know that I don't eat sushi.  I'd rather have a root canal with no pain meds that eat raw fish!  I'll leave the sushi review to someone else.  The Chinese food here is solid.  Every selection was full and kept that way while I was there.  All the temperatures were proper.  Won-ton soup was great.  The dumplings were very good.  One of the most popular buffet entrees is chicken with broccoli.  Here it was tasty but they need to use more care with the broccoli.  There were quite a few substandard pieces.  The hibachi station was excellent.\n\nNobody expects gourmet cuisine at a Chinese buffet but here you will get solid fresh-tasting A-OK food at a decent price and friendly service.  I'll be back.",

  "text": "While I have two semi-local Wayback locations, I haven't been to either in years.  Part of it is location but a lot of it is price in relation to what is being rendered.  \n\nWe rumbled in here last weekend late afternoon and aside from one other couple the place is deserted.  The order was simply four of their \"classic\" burgers with various different topping combinations.\n\nWhat worked best was actually the yuppie/hipster brand of black cherry and root beer sodas they offer.  They're nothing extravagant but because of the cane sugar sweetener they are very good.  \n\nThe burgers are...ok.  Look, if we want energy independence from OPEC we just need Wayback to make more burgers which we could then use for drilling because there is plenty of oil/grease in those puppies.  The taste is there but so is the (Burp!) aftertaste.  Noteworthy are the cumulative amount of cheese choices, veggies and sauces you can add on for free.  The average person should be more than covered.\n\nEven though no other orders aside from ours were occurring it still took 15+ plus minutes for them to bring the food to the table.  A lot of this was due to the talking/goofing around from the staff.  No one was what you would call in a hurry.\n\nBack in the day Wayback offered a burger of the month or some kind of special.  Maybe I missed it but I didn't see any verbiage about something like that currently going on.  \n\nThe whole fresh not frozen thing is to me an overrated marketing gimmick. Seemingly everyone does that now. What else do you have to offer that is unique or that differentiates you from the myriad of burger places that are everywhere?\n\nSome people want to group Wayback in with places like Smashburger or Elevation or Shake Shack but I don't think that's applicable.  The difference is that the aforementioned places either attempt to pimp/hipster their burgers which is why they charge a premium for them.  With Wayback it's all about simple.  If you're in the mood for  greasy ass patties that are smashed on the flattop then this is your spot.  If not then you're going to feel like you didn't get your money's worth.",

  "text": "Be still my beating heart. I may have found a new love. I've discovered a restaurant that has three of my favorites and they do them all well. I'm besides myself with excitement and can't wait to tell you about it. \n\nMy inaugural  visit here was with the ISC (International Super Club). As my usual, I arrived early. This gives me an opportunity to relax at the bar before all the members arrive. Tonight I started out with one of their signature adult beverages.  One of my favorites is a Manhattan,  which we will talk about later.  However, their Heartbreak and Setbacks is kinda similar, so that is where I begun. The. Bonded Rye was smooth and being served on the rocks made a refreshing cocktail. \n\n As I enjoyed my cocktail,  I munched on their Crab Avacado.  Once you have enjoyed this appetizer, it will be hard to go back to regular guacamole.  It's a smooth blend of avocado,tomato,onion and cilantro.   Then it is topped with shredded crab meat and served with lotus root chips. It's the perfect nosh while sipping a cocktail. \n\nSomehow my H&S was gone before the appetizer and I needed a second adult beverage. For my next cocktail, I went with my favorite, a Manhattan. To test the masterfully skills of a barkeep, I take mine up. She nailed it. Happy boozer, here. \n\nAs our members arrived, we moved to our tables. Here I started out with another of my favorites, chicken wings. They were served crispy and the mix of lemongrass and Thai Chili, was a delicious mix of tangy and heat.\n\nBefore I could order my entree, Stevie needed another cocktail. #3 would be an Old Fasioned. Again, the young barkeep nailed it. It's good to see that in addition to being creative in mixing and creating new cocktails, they are still mastering the classics.  \n\n Finally, the piece of resistance of the whole night was the Bao Soft Shell Crab.  Soft shell crab is not only one of my favorites it is one of my weaknessess.  Whenever I see it on the menu it is a must have.  This is the first time I have had it on a bao  and I can honestly say it will not be the last.  I was expecting the softshell crab to be in pieces, but to my surprise it was one entire crab placed between the bao. I first enjoyed eating my way around the bao, experiencing the delicious soft shell crab. Then I ate the bao getting the full experience of the; eel sauce, masago, kaware and mayo. That is when I said, be still my beating heart. I was in love. \n\n The ambience is extremely comfortable and modern. Their service is detailed, friendly and professional.  A combination that provides you a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. \n\nI'll be back? - Hell, yes.  They've got three of my favorites.\n\nWhen - June 21, 2018\nWhy - International Supper Club",

The standard is most definitely chicken (large fried wings) on waffles (homemade: sweet potato!) with (warmed!) syrup & (peach-infused!) butter! Game on.\n\nMaxine's being attached to a gas station is misleading; it's a full on restaurant! For a long time, I thought it was truck-stop style; nope, full on noshery! 'Twas a Sunday morning at 1030am & much of Indy had the same idea we did; then, account for those sneaking in such a brunch before the Colts kick-off at 1pm, too. The \"15 minute wait\" was in fact 15 minutes. Enough time to read the tale of Maxine and how all this came to be -- direct from Love Town, apparently!\n\nThe service was mighty attentive, and mighty refreshing. The coffee was always filled & warm. We got lucky with a larger table for two, so there was plenty of room for the Sunday paper!\n\nSo I had to figure out how to get the smothered chicken (which was on the menu) on top of a sweet potato waffle. You're right... that's not a tough feat in this day & age. They combined two dishes for me. And I gotta say, yes, I blew the minds of the powers-that-be at Maxine's with my apparently ground-breaking order of gravied chicken on a waffle, but mine looked totally better than their house special.\n\nOften, establishments will do these nice little touches of service or try and fail at them, Maxine's made the finest touch of classy service I've witnessed -- warmed maple syrup. Hell, it might've been warmed under a heat lamp -- whatev -- replacing the cold, old syrup with the warm stuff was a strong move.\n\nHowever, no bacon? A sudden waft of weaksauce has overcome Maxine's. Bah! Peach-infused Butter on a Sweet Potato Waffle with gravy-smothered chicken, topped with warmed maple syrup! Waffling on a decision where breakfast or brunch is no more, Maxine's is the tops!",

  "text": "I've eaten everything on the menu... more than once... what does that tell you about this place? \n\nRice Box Kitchen is the restaurant I've always known our community needed, and when I discovered it, I immediately reached out to thank them for opening in Reno. Unsurprisingly, Rice Box Kitchen's cuisine has surprised many who have visited in the best way possible because what they're serving is almost entirely new to our community. \n\nRice Box serves Thai street and comfort food and their dishes aren't found on many menus in town. Chef and owner Perapol puts love and attention into each offering because these are the dishes he grew up eating in his mother's kitchen, and he strives to make sure we can feel that in each plate.\n\nI can never decide between the Khao Moo Dang and the Khao Man Gai, so I will usually just flip a coin to decide. \n\nThe Khao Moo Dang is rich, roasted pork served in a deliciously sweet, savory, and slightly spicy sauce served over rice. You can get extra spice on the side, which I recommend. \n\nKhao man gai is a steamed chicken dish served over coconut rice, which is ADDICTING. The rice might, no IS the star of this dish. That and the ridiculously herbaceous sauce that goes over top of it. This is a light dish despite its components and good to the last bite.\n\nDon't skip Sundays! Perapol does a delightful dim sum menu! Order ahead Fri and Sat and make sure you get some because it sells out! \n\nThis is the kind of place I've been waiting for, and seeing the community's response has made me so happy. It's a sign of major progress for our food scene and I can't wait to see this place grow!",

  "text": "Free Tours By Foot offers a variety of tours throughout the day with no upfront cost!  At tour's end you pay/tip what you can afford OR what you feel it was worth.\n\nThe available walking tours are the French Quarter Tour, Cemetery Tour, Voodoo Tour, and Ghost Tour.  While each one is led by a local and licensed guide, they fill up fast so plan weeks in advance.  \n\nAccording to the Travel Channel, New Orleans ranks as the #1 most haunted city in America.  Because of this fact, I chose to attend the Ghost Tour that was led by Sean Chick, who was enthusiastic and friendly.  Due to my love for horror movies, I was looking to be spooked, but to my disappointment it turned out to be more PG-rated than I had expected.  However, the dark, dirty streets in NOLA did project an unsettling atmosphere and Sean provided an entertaining narrative that was informational and historical, just not horrifying.  \n\nDespite that, I still feel like the tour is worth it since Free Tours By Foot allows anyone, poor or rich, to enjoy NOLA, in depth.  The highlight of the trip was being able to see the famous LaLaurie Mansion in person--the mansion where a physician and his wife tortured and experimented on slaves. \n------\nConclusion: A business model that bests every touring company in the country!  If only they could intensify the material.  Each tour is only about 1.5 hours so you can plan all of them in a day if time slots allow.  When you book online, the tour guide will email a few days beforehand to ensure you'll still be attending. Then they'll give you a location to meet and a picture of themselves so you'll recognize them on the day.  Remember to tip your guide!  They supposedly offer food, swamp, and bike tours! Take advantage!\n\nExtra Notes:\n-Tip with Cash\n-Tour goes on rain or shine, so bring an umbrella and dress in layers\n-Bring water and comfortable shoes\n-This tour taught me that Nicholas Cage is one sick-minded guy lol\n-No restroom breaks",

When I have, the experience has never been so memorable that I yearn to return.  Well I'm guessing you can call Sardi's Peruvian Chicken a la Brasa fast food as it is a small chain and it doesn't have waiter service.  And if you can count it as fast food, let me give my first five-star rating ever to a fast food eatery. \n\nFirst of all, what a great idea it is to have a fast-food Peruvian eatery.  Peruvian pollo a la brasa is such a tasty dish and guess what - it is here as well.  It was juicy and flavorful and perfectly grilled.  The side of Peruvian corn was yummy.  Did you know corn is indigenous to Peru and the Inca Indians?  The corn at Sardi's is the big kernel corn variety which is a real treat.  My other side was an arroz chaufa.  It was great as well and this stir-fried rice dish brought to Peru by Chinese immigrants and then adapted completed a very enjoyable and filling meal.\n\nI ordered by phone and everything was packed & ready when I arrived.  Well if Sardi's is what fast food is all about, I better have a more open mind!",

However, this one has a really excellent location, with an awesome view of the water in the Gulf as well as in the harbor, and it wasn't a bad spot at all for my first meal on this trip to St. Pete.\n\nThe food here was actually surprisingly good.  We split two shrimp dishes and enjoyed them both.  The shrimp cocktail comes with huge shrimp, and I liked how they did the cocktail sauce-- a lump of horseradish on top so you can mix it in to taste.  The coconut shrimp were even better.  The beer menu isn't particularly inspired, but they have some decent options on tap.\n\nThe boardwalk at Madeira Beach almost definitely has restaurants that are less kitschy, but I don't know that it has any with a better view.  I want to check out the more local options while I'm in town, but don't regret my visit to Bubba Gump one bit.",

  "text": "I have seen quite a few movies at this Muvico for one main reason, the popcorn seasoning!  They have a ton of different flavors, like nacho cheese, white cheddar, kettle corn, etc.  I know, I know, I can buy those seasonings at grocery stores and put them on my own popcorn for much cheaper, but there is something special about being at a theater with a huge tub of popcorn absolutely covered in seasoning and butter.  I like getting the endless popcorn buckets.  However, last time I was there they ran out so I could only get a large.  This was disappointing.  \n\nThe theater itself is pretty nice.  I appreciate how they will validate parking at the parking garage across the street.  The seats are cushy making them really comfortable.  Like other reviewers have noted, the theater is pretty cold, so bringing a sweater is suggested.  Some of the theaters are pretty small, but I'm not picky about size.  Honestly, I really do go for the popcorn seasoning.  \n\nSometimes when there are large movie opening, like the last Batman movie, you actually choose your seats instead of first come first serve.  Just something to be aware of.",

This was my first stay at Four Seasons and if there was no beach across the street and the pretty grounds/vibe, there would be no reason to stay here.  Across the board at all the dining options, some dishes were good and some were just so boring or underwhelming.  It's odd that it is very hit or miss.

They opened at 9:30am but I arrived a little early on Saturday, and was still allowed to enter as a walk in.  The salon is nice and they have lots of pretty colors from which you can choose. \n\nThe nail tech was busy working on another lady and asked her co-worker Leah (Lia?) to wrap my current gels nails so they could be removed.  Leah is awesome; she is a 5-star chica! Nice, personable, and friendly. She told me about a new mermaid chrome application.  I asked to see a photo, but they didn't have any. I decided to try it anyway.  (See my photos to see what it looks like. The look will vary based on which base color you use.)\n\nThe nail tech was also friendly, but seemed to be rushed because they were short staffed that day. She gave suggestions on what colors look best with the mermaid chrome. The price for a full set of gel nails is $25. Not bad! The chrome application is $35, which is ridiculous. I don't mind paying for great quality, but for 20 seconds of rubbing glitter powder on my nails? C'mon.  Anyway... I didn't fuss about the price. I am, however, fussing about the quality.  The polish on my left thumb nail was somehow crumpled.  Unfortunately, I didn't see this in the shop, but the nail tech (Nancy?) did.  I remember her examining that nail and reapplying some clear polish. I didn't realize why until I left the shop and saw that she allowed me to leave the shop with a jacked up nail, AND still charged me full price! That is horrible!  The other nails look nice and I do like the mermaid chrome look, so it would have been a 4 or 5 star review if she hadn't tried to get over on me like that.  She knew (from our conversation) that I was visiting and wouldn't be able to return to get it fixed.  Shame on you, girl!  \n\nIf you decide to come here, check your nails in good lighting before leaving and before paying to make sure they aren't messed up!",

I had never been there before, as I don't usually eat out at Italian restaurants. But I was very excited to experience a Reno institution! \n\nAside from a few glitches, our dining experience was very nice. The glitches included being seated at our table but then having to wait 15 minutes before our server Erika came to take our drink orders and the bread coming out too close to the salad course. I had read on so many people's Yelp reviews that the seafood lasagna is to die for, so I ordered it as my main ($24). I did not know that it would come in a white sauce, and it was a bit... weird. Don't get me wrong, it was very tasty, but totally not what I was expecting. Perhaps I've been corrupted from all my years eating Stouffer's lasagna in all of its delicious red sauce varieties. \n\nSo many details were done correctly, though, from the chilled salad forks to the warmed bread. I really appreciated that the bread was cut into wedges rather than horizontal slices. It made it even more delightful to dip in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I hear that eating bread with pasta and putting olive oil on restaurant tables are things that are not actually done in Italy, but I don't care: in America, we love it and I expect it. Johnny's did not disappoint!\n\nMy Caesar salad ($2.50 extra; house salads are included with entrees) was delicious. Not made table-side, to be sure, but still excellent in flavor. I didn't have dessert, but I tried a bite of one friend's tiramisu ($6.50) and another friend's Florentine cup ($7.50), and both were quite tasty. The Florentine cup is one of their signature desserts: ice cream and strawberries in a cup that was made of almond brittle, with balsamic syrup and zabaglione drizzled over it. In the future, when my sweet tooth calls, I will have to remember to stop by for a glass of wine and a dessert enjoyed at the bar!\n\nThe large windows that faces the hills of southwest Reno gives the restaurant a beautiful feel. It really is a gorgeous old-timey but well-maintained interior. But it's really not my style for date night or even for taking parents or grandparents. One of my friends tells me that her department at UNR often takes job candidates out to dinner there. I won't be recommending it to my department for such purposes: it's not the right feel for millennial prospective hires. But I can see why it has been a Reno institution for so long!",

The food has a slightly different flair than what you find at many New Orleans style food places and they have some unique items.  I really prefer the food at R&O's so I only end up here when the wait is too long there but this place can certainly please the palate when needed.",

It looks like a giant, aged mansion, and that makes it even cooler.\n\nWe admittedly first came for the advertised \"Free Appetizer\" (with Yelp check-in), and wound up not even using it. (You have to purchase 2 full entrees to get it, we wound up with something like an entree and 2 appetizers. No big deal.)\n\nThe balcony is fantastic, service is good, and the food is impeccable - all right in the Quarter. I highly recommend the crab claw dish.",

  "text": "I pass this place every day on my way to and from work.  Today is the day I didn't have the energy to cook dinner, so I decided to treat the fam to some Black Diamond BBQ for dinner.  \n\nThe young man at the counter was very friendly and accomodating -- even going to 'check the meats' to see which ones looked good for me.  I took his suggestion on the rib tips and then opted for the brisket and chicken.  Got the \"hungry man dinner\" (or something of the like) with 3 meats and 2 medium sides plus bread -- about $26 total (no drinks).\n\nThe smell in the car on the way home was intoxicating!  Smoky, sweet, meaty... I couldn't wait to get home and try what I got the fam for take out.  Turns out, that is kind of where my intense imaginary BBQ love affair ended.\n\nDon't get me wrong--the brisket was SUPER tender with a good smoke and the chicken fell off the bone...yet the white meat of the chicken was dry??  The rib tips were pretty good and the sauces were good, too.  However, the sides were below average at best.  Based on another yelp review I tried the mac and cheese and baked beans.  The mac and cheese was straight velveeta...no baked goodness, no love was felt by this self-professed mac and cheese guru.  The baked beans were actually really really sweet tasting--which would have been fine if that is your thing-- but we like a smoky, deep BBQ bean instead.  To each their own I guess.  \n\nI would have killed for some cobbler to try, but it is only available on the weekends.  Boooooo.    \n\nAsk for the cornbread--it is in the back, not out like the loaves of bread they will give you if you don't ask.  Cornbread was pretty darn good.\n\nOverall, we would go back for the brisket and skip the sides.  I would also like to try their pulled pork.  Maybe a lunch special is in our future.",

  "text": "This was the perfect spot for me and my girls to have our last meal before heading back home from our mini-getaway.  SOOO glad we picked this place!\n\nSanta Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You're also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don't feel like waiting. \n\nWe were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  \n\nThe four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!\n\nWe started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!\n\nMy friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  \n\nOverall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)",

They were good and served with two sauces: sweet and sour, and hot mustard.\n\nThat was perfect for me. I usually mix the two sauces for both crab Rangoon and eggrolls.\n\nFor an entrée I got a shrimp-cashew dish that included raw white cabbage and perfectly small diced water chestnuts in a broth, but it could have been a sauce. But it was light. And wonderful.\n\nThe cabbage was on the side, so I had to mix it, and it worked.\n\nThe shrimp were rather large for this type of dish. Many skimp with a smaller shrimp. These were large, perfectly deveined and perfectly cooked.\n\nGreat dinner, great company! Thanks, Aaron, for the crab Rangoon appetizer.\n\nThanks, Brian M., for organizing this UYE!\n\nI took home a lot of my entrée  . . .  which was good for two more meals. And it was fabulous, 'cause those little small-diced water chestnuts crunch worked so well in heating up in the microwave. And I held the cabbage out so it could still be fresh and crunchy.",

How am I supposed to feel good about eating a 3 minute chicken. The miso soup made my belly feel good and so did the sweet potato tempura. Broccoli tempura? Not so much. I'd say it was an underwhelming lunch, BUT my friend and I did share the mochi ice cream. Mmmm mochi.\n\nPlans of getting to NYC today, canceled. Thanks guys, I blame you.",

I've been making my way through the tapas menu and so far everything I've tried has been great.\n\nLast night, I made some reservations for wine after dinner. We were seated quickly, no issue. We did not want to eat though, just wanted wine, and it seemed like our server did not like that. We tried to order a bottle of Zinfindal and all he said was, \"no.\" We asked if they were out and he just kept saying, \"no\" with no explanation, so we had a bottle of Pino Noir. I was kind of confused there because this purported as a wine bar so is it so weird that guests would order wine?\n\nOther than that the experience was pleasant! After some time our server kind of warmed up to us and was being a lot more friendly. The space is small, lovely and warm, and makes for some great ambiance. I'm all about small places like this. I also love sitting in close proximity because we got to engage with some other tables! There was a woman walking around taking care of tables as well and she was also very friendly!\n\nIn my prior visits here I ordered the patatas bravas which are the best!

  "text": "Easy to get to nursery and landscape center right off of State Street in West Boise.  So far the best of the nurseries we've visited in town for selection and with the most beautiful tree and shrub specimens; almost as if each one was hand selected for their inventory.  Service is cordial.  Prices seem competitive.  They provide landscape design consulting and installation services if you need them.  They're having a fall sale right now on some items that are summer season focused (like ornamental fountains and some perennials) so might be a good time to go in if you're in the market.\n\nPRODUCT\nTrees, shrubs and sub shrubs, perennials, annuals, seeds, ornamental grasses, vines, decorative fountains, benches, garden ornaments and soil outside plus an inside space with garden maintenance items including tools and fertilizers and garden themed decorating items and gifts.\n\nWe were on the hunt for fall annuals and perennials for pots and carts for a patio in a rental home;  we didn't want to make a huge dollar investment but we wanted good specimens.   We found the best assortment here of really interesting things in great form at fair prices and we were at several nurseries and \"big box\" garden centers in Eagle and Boise to reach that conclusion.\n\nThere are things here we simply didn't see anywhere else. We're still too new to the area to know for sure, but this seems a hard to beat spot for perennial gardeners.  The tree and shrub specimens were also top quality and form. For my husband and me a place like this is like an art exhibit for plantings.  And the great thing is, you can afford to buy them and take them home. \n\nPRICE\nGallon containers of fall annuals were only a buck more than some \"big box\" stores, for example, on some items and comparing same to same the specimens were much better here.  On some perennials and shrubs you might pay 20% more than big box outlets but the superior product and shopping experience at Farwest are worth the investment.  In comparison to other specialty nurseries, the price points here seemed par with much better range of selections.\n\nEXTRAS\nThey offer classes and seminars (like how to use ornamental grasses or how to make wreaths) at nominal fee.  ($25ish each I think.)  They also do container (pot) planting.  Hard to find good experts in this field so happy to have discovered this adding to the potential list for next year.\n\nPARKING & ACCESS\nPaved parking lot makes getting from parking into the plant sales area easy by foot or otherwise and the paver pathways down the center aisle sure make pulling a cart with plants on it easier.  Striped access aisle for ADA van accessible parking is sometimes blocked by display materials. Large packed gravel is surface for the side areas.  Gift shop / retail store is level in.",

  "text": "Sorry Yelpers, but I thought this Jose Garces restaurant was just okay.\n\nVillage Whiskey is pretty tiny.  About seven round tables that could fit maybe three people (might be able to fit four, but highly unlikely) and some room at the bar.  Came for lunch at 11:30am when they opened, and by about 12:15pm, all the tables and most of the seats at the bar were taken.  \n\nWe were the second group to be seated, and although there was no one else in the restaurant at the time, our waitress seemed to be preoccupied after taking our order.  She knew we were still deciding on drinks, so why didn't she check on us again?  Hello!  She wasn't very attentive and seemed like she would rather be elsewhere.\n\nI ordered the Village Burger (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with Boston bibb lettuce, tomato, and house-made thousand island dressing: $11) and added Jasper Hill cheddar cheese ($3.50) and fried egg ($1.50).  Perfect brunch meal right?  Eh.  Was just okay.  The burger wasn't anything spectacular, definitely not anything to rave about.  It was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Usually the bun makes the burger (for me at least), and I thought the sesame roll was okay.  Tasted like an everyday burger bun to me.  The cheddar cheese and fried egg were a nice additional to the burger.  At 8 ounces, this burger is pretty huge!  Could definitely serve as another meal or late night snack.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=QZ4Yn47TLprQlbCRWMtZdw\n\nWe also ordered the duck fat french fries with sly-fox cheddar sauce ($7) to share.  I've always always wanted to try duck fat fries.  These left me wanting more.  Really...is this what they really taste like?  I hope not.  These fries were more soggy than crispy, and left a weird after taste in my mouth.  The cheddar sauce was a welcomed additional, but not necessary.  The sauce would have been better if it was hotter.  \n\nWhen our waitress finally came back with our food, we were able to order the Irish Car Bomb shake ($9).  Ours definitely didn't look like a lot of the pictures that were posted on Yelp.  For $9, this shake better be spectacular!  Again, it was just okay.  I did enjoy those chunks of brownie pieces though! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ?select=EbqJLiD6Pkw7u1KgFVmJAA\n\nRG ordered the Whiskey King (an 8 ounce burger on a sesame roll with maple bourbon glazed ciopollini, rogue bleu cheese, applewood bacon, and foie gras-$26).  Massive burger.  The bleu cheese was almost non-existent.  I tried a bite, and the foie gras was pretty good.  The applewood bacon was a nice touch.  But again, the burger was just okay.  \n\nFYI-Don't look up at the ceiling fans, they were so filled with dirt, that you might get dust in your eyes!",

We were lucky to be seated in a private room on the side away from the noise of the Carousel bar (but I heard it's one of the best bars in the area..)\n\nStarting with drinks, the sazerac was done properly and was very strong.  We started with house rolls and olive focaccia, but the highlight was the butters: sea salt, brown sugar, and herb.\n\nOnto food:\n- Prosciutto de rosa: pretty much a caprese.  Tomatoes aren't exactly in season, and the mozzarella was just ok\n- Crab and corn cake: well seasoned, hearty but not too heavy\n- Redfish with tomato jam: the redfish was cooked just right and topped with lots of crab.  The tomato jam over the pasta below was really the highlight - it was swee, not too tart and a nice contrast to the rest of the dish\n- Baked gulf shrimp bienville: lots of crab stuffed into large shrimp with a pretty decent risotto\n- Mushrooms: probably my favorite sides\n- Winter vegetables: cauliflower, romesco, brussels sprouts, green beans; nothing extraordinary\n- Spinach: not too oily\n\nEveryone in our party of 7 liked her food.  Our server knew the menu well and was very nice.  It was a good way to kick off our weekend in New Orleans.",

  "text": "I have been curious to check out this place and since it's an hour drive for me, the opportunity presented itself last minute and I got to check it out with friends. I ordered elote( corn, lime, aioli and cheese) and Las Favoritas( chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon) to start. The elote was with clear winner between these two dishes. I also had the opportunity to try Bombas Contigo( fried potato with bacon with brava sauce); I love potatoes and I loved theses as they were formed with potato shreds and not fried mashed potato.\nI enjoyed shared carafe of red sangria followed with a Pisco Punch and they were standard for me. Just OK cocktails. My husband and I shared the Parillada platter which is described as: Ribeye, chorizo, morcilla, lamb chop, roast marrow, salsa verde, chimichurri, and seasonal vegetables. So basically it was a plate of meat, which is what we were expecting but no real side to the dish. My husband and I loved the morcilla (blood sausage); who knew blood sausage could be so tasty? All this was finished off with one surprisingly great dessert called the Capirotada( bread pudding with figs and goat cheese?), that was rich without being heavy.\n\nIt was a very busy night and so initially our service was attentive and then it went down hill.\nIn the midst of conversation, the waiter handed us our bill.  So I asked him, he aren't you going to tell us about your great desserts?  However, it took so long to arrive that I regretted ordering dessert; a line had crossed. My husband wanted to leave as the place was getting increasingly crowded but we were in limbo waiting for my dessert while sitting outside in a breezy evening on the patio at 8pm, with an hour drive home in our future.",

  "text": "This was my first stay at this location although I am a Spire Rewards Member and have been staying at IHG properties for years. I chose this particular hotel because of the location and because of the reputation of the Crowne Plaza Brand. There seems to be some minor construction out front but it doesn't seem to affect the hotel's operation.  I was fortunately upgraded upon check-in to a \"Cabana Suite\" these accommodations I'm sure made our stay a lot more pleasant than some of the past reviews - the living area was very spacious and filled with comfortable furnishings. There was a nice area for eating or preparing food including a hidden refrigerator and microwave, all the appliances were clean and operational. The bathroom was spacious as well but lacked the proper lighting although there was a plug in lighted mirror provided and stored under the vanity - the walking shower was very nice and the shower had adequate water pressure and the complimentary toiletries were of good quality. The bedroom was comfortable but again some lighting issues all the shades and blinds functioned and were in good condition the bed was comfortable and the bedding was very nice, fresh and clean.\n\nI was offered a voucher for a cocktail at the bar or welcoming points I opted for the points but was a little disappointed that I wasn't comped for breakfast - I thought the continental breakfast for ten dollars plus per person was a little weak and the dining area staff was a little too concerned about ensuring they secured breakfast charges verses providing good customer service. The second morning I opted for two small cups of coffee in to go cups for five ninety-five it came with food service coffee mate non dairy creamers. The hotel check-in and check-out experience was good the staff was very friendly over-all it was a pleasant stay, I only wish I had avoided the restaurant, the entire setup is awkward and uncomfortable and a bit ridiculous for what it is and needs to be looked at by the management team - this alone may make me consider staying at a different property in the future and the restaurant experience makes this property just okay in my opinion maybe, I will just book the room and look for other options for dining and refreshments in the future...",

  "text": "Man, you know when you see someone's food pictures and all you want to do is run to that restaurant to try it? Welcome to my world. I saw Cin's pictures and couldn't get Rostizado's chicken/pork/churros out of my mind. Too bad the pictures were better than the meal we had. Not that Rostizado's is bad or anything - unfortunately, overpriced is the word that keeps popping into my mind.\n\nAs a group of 5, we decided to check out Rostizado's during their opening weekend (another bad idea as I generally wait for a restaurant to get the kinks out). We arrived at 6:30pm and were told that we had to wait for about 30 minutes. Not a big deal as they have two comfy couches to chill out at and you can order drinks/appetizers while you wait. They bring you out this small bowl of chick peas/nuts/other stuff (a satisfying bowl of bar snacks, if you will) that is SO good. I could have ate a couple bowls to myself...but I'm nice and shared it with the group.\n\nThe place itself is gorgeous and everything is open concept style. Take a peek at the kitchen where you can see the chickens roasting in the background. Wow. I also like how they use the old school vinyl's to play music. You are most definitely paying for the trendy, cool atmosphere.\n\nOther things - one friend pointed out the logo looks like it came from Tinder (that cracked me up) and the way the servers use iPads to take your order is very efficient but lacks a bit of warmth/customer service. As well, I found it odd how the server kept on having to come back to our table to refill our glasses for water. Why not just leave a bottle or two on the table, it would make life easier for everyone.\n\nWhile we waited, my friends ordered a couple bebidas (beer, lemon, and a couple of their specialty drinks) and perused the menu.\n\nFor food, we split our table in half for sharing and so that we could try a few more dishes off their menu.\n\n- Rosto-pollo ($32.00 half order) - one pair of friends shared this and had to order more tortillas. They weren't very impressed with the chicken but did consume all of it. No chance you're wasting $32.00 for half a chicken!\n- Chips and salsa ($10.00) - you get to select your two sauces. My friend went with the pico de gallo Yucateco and salsa de rabanitos. A nice dish to start our meal off.\n- Platter for 2 ($55.00) - combination of chicken and pork, roasted potatoes, and tortillas. We split this between the three of us. Again, they don't give you enough tortillas! We had to order more ($1.50 extra) and we also ordered a Manzano hot sauce (they charged $5.00! For a sauce.). You would think $55.00 would cover at least having enough tortilla wraps, but apparently not. The pork was great - tender, flavourful, just the right amount of fat to it but the chicken, we sadly weren't blown away by. It was good but it seemed like the rub/spice that they used didn't fully penetrate the whole chicken. The roasted potatoes were delicious though!\n- Roasted cauliflower ($13.00 for full order) - Chile de arbol, garlic, cumin, sea salt, lime juice and cilantro. It was nice to have a vegetable dish to go with all the meat we ordered. I like how they put whole pieces of roasted garlic in it! Yum.\n- Ceviche de robalo ($16.00) - Chilean sea bass in lime juice, habanero chilies (gave it a nice hint of spiciness to the ceviche), white onion, oranges and avocado. It was flavourful but the dish was TINY. It also randomly came with a small bowl of chips.\nChurros con dulce de leche ($8.00) - these were great. Churros came out piping hot. Nice crunchy texture. The dulce de leche sauce was good but seemed overly runny? We all agreed it would have been better if it was thicker.\n\nI'm happy that Edmonton is finally opening up new restaurants and wish nothing but the best for Rostizado's. Hopefully, they work on a few things and make some changes price wise, otherwise I can't see myself going back anytime soon.",

  "text": "Bowood Farms is not your typical nursery/landscaping store.  Sure, it has a nice selection of indoor and outdoor plants, flowers and trees, it's well-stocked with seeds and supplies and containers.  It's even got books to help you figure out what to grow, whether you've got a huge lot or a postage stamp-sized patio.  It's true, a lot of stores offer those things.  Bowood, however, also offers free speakers and programs to help you become a more successful gardener--and they have FOOD.  \n\nI'm a major sucker for both gardening and food, so I'm totally sold on the place.  \n\nRight now they offer bison that's pasture-raised on their farm in Clarksville; they're also hard at work on getting the Bowood Cafe up and running.  In addition to serving bison from their Clarksville farm, the cafe will offer produce from their garden across the street and herbs grown on their rooftop--it doesn't get much more local than that!\n\nJustin and I had the chance to attend a program featuring Diane Whealy of Seed Savers Exchange and learn a bit about heirloom gardening and biodiversity this weekend; we're already looking forward to the Creative Composting class in April.  Such wonderful resources for FREE!  And they have heirloom seeds and compost containers available at the store (not for free, of course). :)  \n\nEven if you're not planning on buying a ton of plants or becoming a Master Gardener, Bowood Farms has tons to offer--educational and practical programs, plenty of things to inspire even the most inexperienced gardener... and coming soon, wonderful locally grown food to fill your belly!  I think I'm hooked.",

  "text": "Joella's Hot Chicken is the first Indiana location of a small Kentucky-based chain of \"hot chicken\" restaurants with Ohio soon to join the crowd. \n\nHot Chicken, for the uninitiated, is a \"tradition\" that is said to have started in Nashville, TN and basically takes your traditional Southern fried chicken and gives it a kick. In the case of Joella's, that \"kick\" comes in varying degrees ranging from \"no heat\" (which really is pointless if you're actually coming here) to spiked honey (sweet mild), Ella's Favorite (a sort of mid-range option), Tweener (medium heat), Hot (spicy fire!), and Fire-in-Da-Hole (the hottest, indeed). They have six chicken plate options including, yes, an actual vegan option. I ordered a 3 Jumbo Tenders Plate that comes with one of several dipping sauce options along with one of several sides. You can get the tenders grilled upon request. \n\nThe drink is not included in the plate and my entire meal, including drink, came in at just over $11, a fairly standard price for this Indy/Fishers border area. \n\nJoella's also offers \"Sammies,\" Salads, a handful of dessert options, and they do serve beer, soft drinks, bottled craft/flavored sodas, and both sweet/unsweet iced tea. \n\nIn case you don't realize it, Joella's took over the spot vacated by 96th Street Steakburgers. The interior is in more of a Southern/Americana theme and it appears that they are working on adding an outside dining area. They do not offer drive-thru - worth noting since the drive-thru in the building is still present. \n\nThey have a couple of accessible parking spots and you should note that the only curb cut is on the east side of the restaurant (the same side as the accessible parking - for once, logic prevails!). \n\nAs you enter, you are immediately surrounded by the dining area and the ordering counter is straight ahead. You order, they give you a number and you get your own drinks from a fountain to the left. The fountain is not particularly wheelchair friendly, though I was able to make it work. \nI thought the cups were a tad small - not sure of their size, maybe 16 or 20 oz, but for a place that emphasizes hot food I definitely found myself wishing I didn't have to go back up to get a refill. \n\nThe food? The chicken is hormone free and you can definitely taste the difference. As I get older, preservatives kick my booty and my body did fine with this chicken. The jumbo? Definitely not jumbo. I found myself looking at it and thinking of at least a half dozen local restaurants with bigger tenders, though certainly I would consider them jumbo compared to most chains. The fries, which I chose as my side, were of a shoestring variety and were served in a nice serving size. \n\nIf I could, I'd likely lean toward a 3.5 star rating. However, I really liked the friendly service and felt like that hospitality factor allows me to up the rating rather than lower it. I wouldn't say this is my favorite chicken, or even chicken tenders, in Indy but it's a place I wouldn't hesitate to eat while in the neighborhood.",

The only complaint I have is that they call it a \"Grill.\".  Well, it's not.  \n\nIt's a sweet little neighborhood bar with a great patio and they serve a limited menu of sandwiches, small pizzas, hummus and such.  While the food doesn't blow me away, it's food, and it's cheap and it's fine.  Much better than having to choose from a neighborhood bar menu of freezer to fryer foods or going to a neighborhood bar with no food at all.  I'm actually impressed, because these little places that are stuck in the middle of a neighborhood really struggle to stay alive and on the radar and usually don't offer any fresh food at all because they can't keep it fresh.  Ggood job Thurman!! \n\n I wish they would change the name from Grill to corner bar or something like that so they don't mislead anyone, but if you are looking for a a solid neighborhood bar with a diverse clientele and a sweet patio to hang out on and you live in the neighborhood, don't over think it.  It's better than most neighborhood bars.  They offer  low key entertainment on some nights.",

  "text": "I found out about Katie's a few years ago, when my mom was visiting during Jazz Fest. It was a Sunday, and we were looking to eat before Jazz Fest food prices emptied our pockets.  \n\nThey only have Brunch on Sundays, and one of the joys of this brunch is the bottomless Mimosa, Bloody Mary or Sangria. The reason I believe this to be the best bottomless cocktail in town is because they give you wine glasses instead of champagne flutes and they're keen on making sure your glass is never half full or half empty, either way you see it. Well worth the $15.\n\nSo my Jazz Fest food of choice has always been the Crawfish Bread since I was old enough to stand in the mud at the Fairgrounds and jam out, but the price has gone up while the quality has gone down. \n\nEnter the Crawfish Beignet at Katie's...I ordered the Crawfish Beignet and my mother ordered another dish and we said we'd split...we said. We both were head over heels for this God's gift to Crawfish Bread lovers. It's an an overstuffed beignet filled with crawfish, jalapeno peppers, onions, and three kinds of cheese; fried then topped with a jalapeno aioli.  Since this visit, I have the most difficult time ordering anything else, though their menu is great and their specials will make you drool. \n\nSince this fateful Jazz Fest, I have visited Katie's with my boyfriend, with a 6 top, to eat at the bar, to eat outside, ordered to-go and never have I been disappointed. \n\nIt's a family-owned restaurant with a great atmosphere. David has been my server a few times, and he's a hoot! I believe Ms. Mary is the hostess, this little lady who'll rock her black and gold on Saints game day and ask you if everything tastes great? And, of course it does. \n\nOn Sunday, get there early because the wait gets to be a little long come 11:30/noonish, but I believe it to be worth it. Also, if you're a 5 top or more during Brunch, the food comes out just a little slower, but catching up with friends and enjoying my bottomless Mimosa is exactly what I want to do on a Sunday morning.",

  "text": "The price sort of sets the tone for this one - it was not the W Hotel in terms of price so it really did not need to woo my pants off with amazingness. This is a good option if you have business anywhere nearby and decide to stay out here rather than take the long drive in from Philly.\n\nExercise room: fail. TV at awkward angle. One failboat elliptical, one treadmill (the only good part of this section,) one stationary bike, and a failboat selection of three dumbbells with the heaviest one being twenty pounds. Failboat water dispenser that had an aftertaste of disgusting. And failboat blinds that don't adequately shut, making me think someone is staring in the window and about to stalk me. Channel selection on the cable was pitiful but maybe that was not the hotel's fault - or maybe it was? Long story short, do not expect to keep up your LA Fitness standards when you come into this exercise room. But it is better than nothing.\n\nThe room: no complaints. Beds, shower, toilet, yep it is all there. And poor cable channel selection again - but maybe not their fault.\n\nThe breakfast: goooooooooooood. They have bagels and cream cheese! Always! I love the everything bagel and it was always well stocked. And they always have a lot of cream cheese to scoop up. For the coffee they have those little flavored hazelnut (and irish creme also) packages to dump in your coffee. The coffee was not always well-stocked, a couple times it was out, but eventually it came back. It seemed like an alternating scheme of disgusting stuff (sausage patty and weird egg/cheese monstrosity) and awesome stuff (biscuits and gravy!) morning to morning. But eh, they have waffles, bagels, muffins, and enough other stuff to fulfill your morning requirements as you jet out of the hotel and on to business.\n\nThe best part: free water bottles at the main desk on your way out.",

When I recently went to Washington, MO for a day trip I discovered, Tony's Sweet Heat Bloody Mary Mix. I wanted to add it to a gift box I was creating for someone and really wanted to avoid having to make the trip back to Wash MO to buy another bottle. \n\nOh, did I mention Tony's is a local brand? It is, it is......Fenton, MO. \n\nI visited Tony's website and found out who carried it locally. I tried to buy it from small local shops, but they were all out (tells me how good it is), so I had to buy it from a BIG chain. However, I will say the price was $2 lower then what I paid in Washington, MO. Also, I was surprised by the attentiveness and friendliness of sales associates assisting on the floor. \nThe cashier was even a pleasant asset to the store. \n\nWill I return? - They rescued me once, I bet they do it again. \n\nWhen: December 13, 2017\nWhy: On a Mission",

  "text": "Ugh, there are times you could kick yourself. This one of those times. I wanted to go to Bab Cafe but the rest of my fam wanted some place more authentic. I found Hana Garden and thought it would be a solid choice despite reading some of my friend's negative reviews. In hindsight, I should've taken their word. \n\nWe walked in and we must've arrived after the lunch rush because there were tables with dirty plates and not enough bussers to clean them. Should've walked out then! Argh! We found a table by the window. We placed our order and waited. The lady who I placed the order with never asked about drinks, so I went up to the counter and I could see the tons of dishes stacked up and a young girl washing the dishes by hand and stacking them on a tray to dry. I've worked as a dishwasher before and I know from experience, those dishes aren't going in any type of machine? \n\nAfter I sat back down we waited an awful long time for our food to arrive. I ordered a beef bulgogi set which included soup for $14.99. Hubs ordered a non spicy ramen $6.99. Daughter ordered her usual Dolsot Bibimbap. \n\nWhen my bulgogi came out, I was quite shocked! It was basically all onions! I took it up to the counter to ask and the lady didn't understand me at first. She explained to me in broken English that since I ordered the set, I get less meat. It literally looked like it was all onions, there were maybe four tiny slices of beef. One piece had so much hard gristle, I couldn't even eat it. \n\nMy daughter's Bibimbap had an off taste like soap residue. We didn't bother to mention it to the staff since no one spoke well enough for us to try to explain. While we waited forever for our meals, hubs waited even longer! His food arrives just as we were pretty much done with our meals, with no apologies. Plus, the broth was super salty and Top ramen would've been better than this. \n\nWill we come back? No! Is it authentic? Yes! It's a hole in the wall, mom n pop restaurant. I really would've loved to have had a better experience but unfortunately, this was pathetic for a business to run this way.",

  "text": "I am back to review Koizi exactly two years to the date. I am happy to say that we liked it a lot. Everything was pretty tasty. Sunday's are the same menu all day for 15.95. If I were you, and you could do lunch times on weekdays, that's the least expensive, under $10. \nIf you haven't been here before, this is all you can eat for one price. Yes, the menu for each item has a price next to it too. That can be confusing. That's if you opt to do a la carte. I guess perhaps for people who do take out. Not sure if they have lots of orders for a la carte.\nToday, we ordered golden chicken soup. It's like egg drop soup texture with chicken and corn(tasty). I ordered a ginger salad. Usually, I don't see that as creamy. This one seemed like a ginger ranch. I also ordered the dancing crab roll and the sexy girl roll. I liked the sexy girl roll the most. I tried the coconut shrimp. That was just okay but mostly batter.  \nMy hubby ordered mango chicken( like sweet and sour chicken, but sauce a tiny bit different(tasty). He also ordered QQ balls. Weird name,huh? That was quarter sized bills of ground turkey beef chicken something, on a stick with like a hoisin soy type sauce. I didn't like that. He lastly had a hibachi plate with n.y. Strip and chicken. It came with fried rice, noodles, and his favorite, not really(broccoli).  Yes as you can tell quite a bit of food. It is all made and brought to you. You don't have to go through a buffet line. \nYou also can choose to sit at a table, or a hibachi table. \nThere is dessert too. Either ice crea, or fried dough, I guess like doughnuts.\nWe chose piña colada and green tea ice cream. Mine came with a birthday candle and the whole staff sings to you. Just in case, you like that stuff, then go here.\nOur server was great. He always checked on us to see if we wanted something. You don't need to order everything at once. Take it slow. Don't overdue it. They. Might charge you, if you have half eaten food. Don't know if they really do. If you like doggie bags, or leftovers, I don't think this is the place for that. I like it here, and there's another location of Koizi in Brandon if you are more convenient to that area. All in all, I like it here, & it's a good option when someone in your group is sushi, & others are anti sushi, or anti seafood kind of people.",

Because Dale Mabry Carrollwood area is definitely a restaurant pocket. With that said, I think will be a good contributor to the community with great food with easy selection. \n\nI like the new restaurant with outside seating that allow many dog owners gladly visit the restaurant. This is a plus in many way just by sacrificing a few parking space with outside seating. \n\nThe restaurant Mediterranean cuisine has a lot to offer. You can have kabob, bowl, sandwich, pita, salad, and piadinas. We got the salmon bowl with Mediterranean Salad Trio. I am good with that. The best is salmon kabob with roasted veggies and quinoa. This is very good dish. The salmon is fresh and grilled very well. I like roasted veggies with a lot flavor. I would go for double roasted veggies incomparable to quinoa. \n\nThe manager did make around our table to see how is our food. I also like to suggest the Mediterranean Lamb Kafka as starter if you happen to visit them.",

As soon as a friend and I walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by the wide smiled owner who was literally doing everything and being everywhere at once. The spot itself is small, but set up in a way where no matter where you sit, you always near the food lol. \nThe decor is nice and fitting for the type of food served.\nSince its all buffet style I did expect there to be more options, but there were only about 6 hot food options, a salad bar and about 2 desserts. \nI did like that fact that it was  100% vegetarian. Not that I'm vegetarian, but there are very few places like this in center city so its a great change of the norm imo. \nMy favorite of the hot food items was the spinach dish. It was flavorful and spicy just how I personally like it. I mean everything had some level of spice to it which I personally loved. The chickpea dish was okay, but not as flavorful as I expected it to be. \nFor the price point of around $8 for the lunch special, its totally worth the try. I'll be dining here again soon just to chat with the owner again and enjoy some good food.",

We were there to celebrate the last day of the Yelps on Tap week and maybe even have a pint of the nevadabeer that was made by the community of Reno with Under the Rose.\n\nAfter a long hot day of getting things done about the house, it was nice to walk into their walk in cooler and pick out a nice cider.  They have a pretty extensive selection of ciders.  Honestly the two I picked weren't really all that.  The second would have been great with dinner.  Almost like a chilled white wine instead of a cider.\n\nBut really the review isn't about the one or two ciders I had.  It's about the cool place that you can get many different beers, wines and ciders at an affordable price and enjoy the nice environment as well.  \n\nThe large windows and all that natural light really make this place feel homey and upscale at the same time.  The women who were behind the counter were very friendly and uber helpful.  One reason to come back to a place is the staff making you feel welcome and this definitely was a very welcoming staff.  They talked about different ciders and beers I might like and suggested a good number.\n\nI will go back.....just not for awhile, I think my liver needs a break from Yelps on Tap week.",

All the old standard bbq dishes are here, such as pulled pork, ribs, smoked turkey, and brisket. \n\nI tried the combination plate, with pulled pork and brisket. There are various sauces you can have with your meat, such as mild, hot, and chipotle. The combination comes with 2 sides. I chose hot sauce with potato salad and vinegar based coleslaw. \n\nThe meat was a bit fatty, and both the pork and brisket were doused heavily in the sauce, making it hard to distinguish which meat was what. The substantial amount of sauce made it also hard to taste the actual meat. What meat I could taste had an overpowering charred flavor. The \"hot\" sauce was more of a mild to medium level to me.\n\nThe sides were decent, but nothing I'd really crave. The real highlight of the meal was actually the banana cream pie. It was light, not too sweet, with a pleasant creamy banana flavor.\n\nService was very friendly and cheerful despite having a lot of patrons to take care of.",

The only challenge is whether the water level (the park is a retention pond for runoff from the interstate) floods out part of the trail.\n\nThe park is a bird sanctuary as well.  In the middle of the eastern most pond, there is an island that is off limits to park visitors, yet close enough to be seen from the shore.\n\nThere is art scattered around the trail, but none of the pieces has information about the name of the piece, the artist, or when it was added to the park.  It seems that if you want to be an art park, there should be some information provided.\n\nThe parking lot is on the east end of the park and seems to be plenty for the number of visitors.  Note:  Watch out for the speed bumps on Dequincy as you head north from 21st St.  \n\nReview #575",

I felt so full for a couple of days after eating here, so I definitely recommend coming hungry to fully enjoy your experience here.",

  "text": "I've had a love affair with La Super Rica Taqueria for 20 plus years.  In all that time I've never been disappointed and have always walked away more than satisfied.  No trip to Santa Barbara would be complete without at least one meal from La Super Rica!  I am so addicted to their food that I will wait outside the restaurant 15 min prior to opening (trust me, I am not the only one).  But even if you end up going during the rush-hour, the line moves pretty quickly.  So be patient...it is worth it!  \n\nYou would think that after all these years I'd have the menu memorized and wouldn't need to even look at it.  But because we end up ordering about 8 items (3 items to eat at the restaurant and 5 or more items to take home), I always bring a pen and paper to write down my order.  Although our list frequently changes, we always order #16 Super Rica Especial, #6 Rajas, #19 Frijole Super Rica and #20 Gordita de Frijole.  Ordering works like this...you place your order at the window, pay, get your receipt, and find a table.  They will call your number once the food is ready.  There's a mini salsa self-service near the pick-up window.  Trust me get a few containers of salsa to go with your meal.  The salsa are fresh, spicy, and delicious.  \n\nThe kitchen is extremely small but so efficient.  There is one person taking orders, one lady making corn tortillas, and 2 cooks on the grill/flat-top.  I don't know how they all fit...but it seems to work for them.  \n\nThe food is tasty, perfectly seasoned, made with fresh ingredients, and authentic.   This is homestyle cooking at its finest...warm, satisfying, and comforting.",

  "text": "Easily one of the best dining experiences I've had in recent memory.  I sat at the bar, and both bartenders were amazingly helpful - I'm glad I was there a little on the early side so they weren't too harried, but I got the feeling that everyone got the same treatment, even as the place filled up (Nashvillians have dinner later than I expected!).\nI went with several of their recommendations, and they didn't steer me wrong on a single one.\nMy Uncle Val was easily the most balanced, nuanced, surprising, gin cocktail I've ever had.  It was light and refreshing (notable for something that is nearly pure alcohol) - it was tropical, but citrusy, and somehow soft and velvety in my mouth - I could have had 12 of them.\nI ordered way too much food for one person, but how could I not try at least a few things?  I started with the poutine which, I'm going to sound like a broken record here - was the best batch of smothered fries I've encountered.  There is some kind of. . . . citrusy/lime blend salt on them I think?  So if you just got one of the fries that was sticking out of the mound of sauce and cheese and chicken, it was this little burst of WOW - can you guys please package and sell whatever that spice blend is?\nI went with a dish that both bartenders recommended - the lamb korma, and the garlic Parmesan naan (I was a little unsure about Parmesan with the korma, but it was amazing).  I would be a regular takeout patron for the curries alone.  These two things were EASILY enough to share with someone and still go home full - as it was I felt horribly guilty that I was only sampling, and waving goodbye to these delicious dishes half finished.\nThe bartenders really went above and beyond - checking in about dietary restrictions, walking me through the menu and their favorites, and then when I was trying to decide on the best libation to go with my korma, they poured me little samples of three things they thought might work, so I could pair them once the food arrived.  THAT is customer service, and why I would absolutely say that this was a five star dining experience.\nKudos team - you are definitely doing it right.",

  "text": "I really like Wild Wings. I've had good experiences with them in the Carolinas and so I have been excited to go the Tennessee location. We walked in rather late and were told, the kitchen closes in about 30 but the fryers will stay open for another hour or so. No bigs, it's all about the wings so we go to the bar to and order. The bartender comes up and when we ask for menus he had to make sure the kitchen was still open. We were a little surprised and told him what the host out front told us, he went to check anyway and then came back to tell us what we already had told him.\n\nWe ordered wings and they were as I remembered them: pretty good, distinct flavors and with a good amount of meat on the bones. Full and happy I was ready to pay the check and leave. We waited, waited and then waited some more. Our bartender was preoccupied with a waitress who had obviously come off shift and her phone of youTube clips. We would have tried to get the manager's attention to complain but he was over there yukking it up too. I'm sure I've seen more unprofessional behavior before, but not in recent memory. As I was whispering to my friend about doing a possible dine and dash the bartender managed to tear himself away and asked how we were doing. Good timing on that one. \n\nI'll wait until another Wild Wings opens nearby or until I go to another location out of state.",

  "text": "The Olde Worlde Bakerye & Café has 30 foot ceilings and suggests an old villa in Tuscany, with faux stone and large bread racks showing their attractive wares.  It does seem a little out of place sitting on Smithville Road in Eastampton, NJ, but that does not detract from its pleasant scale.  Outdoor patio seating for nice days is a definite upgrade from the ordinary java joint.  \n\nI stopped in around 10 am for a light breakfast and coffee.  The large menu is suspended from the ceiling behind the cashiers.  Only brekkie sandwiches are available during the week, although a full brunch operation happens on weekends.  No sweat.  I wasn't looking or a big and hearty meal.  The unmistakable aroma of baked bread permeated the room, although they were not baking anything when I was there. The racks behind the counter were loaded to make a bread lover swoon.  All shapes and sizes demonstrated the artistry of the baker. Impressive.\n\nMy Sausage, Egg & Cheese on a Roll was okay, but not more. Their bread was fresh, but lacked the texture and yeastiness I expected from a homemade offering. The sausage patty was about the thinnest I have encountered, but still tasty.  The fried eggs and cheese were ample, and clearly cooked/melted on the grill.  At under $6 for the whole shebang I was ultimately satisfied with the value, if not the exuberance of the sandwich. \n\nMaybe their brunches have more of a \"Wow!\" factor.",

They're a specialty style that not everyone carries, but we thought that perhaps, just maybe Accu-vision Optical might carry the replacement pad for them.\n\nGoing inside. the place was neat, but small. They seemed to be doing a fairly busy trade for 2:30 in the afternoon, so when we got to speak with someone, she said that they used to carry the glasses, but currently they don't. She did look around to see if she could find the nose pieces, but being that they are a specialty style piece, she didn't think they had them.  Sure enough, a few minutes later, she came back empty handed. \n\nNo worries, we were determined to find what we needed, this place just didn't have them. No harm, no foul.",

  "text": "Let me preface this review with the fact that I had to wait an entire 24 hours to think of how I wanted to explain to you, the lovely people of Yelp, how I feel about Lacroix. \n\nYou see, I'm totally in love with the place and at a loss for words. And that is a rare, rare thing indeed.\n\nPlus, I needed a whole day to digest the brunch I ate yesterday. In fact, when I left, I felt like I had a food baby in my belly because I looked about 5 months pregnant. And my food orgy went on for a good three hours, so there was plenty of time to eat my way through the restaurant.\n\nFirst of all, I have to say that I knew it was fancy there, so I kind of expected to feel a little out of place. But as soon as we walked in, there was a friendly, casual vibe that I was totally not expecting. The staff was amazing, and it goes beyond the servers and managers. You see, part of the experience (and seriously, eating brunch here is a total experience) is going back into the kitchen and mingling with the chefs, who are super rad and make me want to go back just so I can sit around and hang out with them. \n\nFood, food, food as far as the eye can see, buffet style in a beautiful setting, and it's everything from the traditional (eggs, waffles, etc.) to the Iron Chef of brunch. Poached quail eggs, strawberry wasabi shooters, scallop sausage...I could go on forever but there's a word limit on reviews and besides, I don't want to spoil all the fun for you. Just take my word for it and go. You'll have a lovely view wherever you sit, can eat the yummiest food you'll ever put in your mouth and have a story to tell your friends and neighbors. I loved my meal here so much that I'm going to make a bold statement, so I hope you're sitting down:\n\nLacroix is so good that I wish I could go back to every 5 star restaurant review I've ever written (with the exception of maybe 3) and change them to 4 stars so you understand how awesome it is here. So take my word, Philadelphia. This place will make you weep with joy. And don't forget to wear stretchy pants or a dress, because I promise that when you leave your belly will be ginormous and you'll be ready for a nap. \n\nBrunch at Lacroix, will you marry me???",

Easy to see why so many dig it, too. It has the best atmosphere for everything you could need over a good cup of coffee, beer, dessert, popsicle from Las Paletas, or even a full meal. The entire menu is pretty awesome.  \n\nWhen I was in living in Nashville back in 2007, it was a mainstay in my day to day life for coffee or somewhere to plop down and do work for my internship. My wife and I recently were in Nashville for the day and stopped in to pick up some whole bean Bongo Java and also pick up a few iced coffees to-go for the next morning on the road. The place hasn't changed much from what I remember -- same bustly atmosphere, great selection of edibles and drinkables, and more than enough room to accommodate a slew of patrons. \n\nDefinitely a huge asset to the Nashville community.

We sat sat inside, which we liked because it was shadier but also still well ventilated because the roof is made of a canvas material that is open is certain areas.\n\nTen stations and some memorable dishes:\n- Carving station: prime rib, rack of lamb, and cedar plank salmon\n- Crepe: savory or sweet, I would pass next time - worst crepe I've ever had. The pancakes are pre-prepared\n- Omelette: looked good\n- Breakfast: egg white muffins, two types of sausages, waffles\n- Lunch: looked un-memorable, pass\n- Salad: something for everyone \n- Cheese and crackers: more like bagel crackers. Also had cold cuts liked aged beef\n- Seafood: five types of caviar, prawns, oysters, and crab\n- Kids' fare: mac and cheese\n- Dessert: the most extensive I've ever seen!   I liked the pastries. \n\nOther things I liked about the experience: a photographer was present to take a complimentary photo before eating, many dishes in the buffet were lined with flowers, the chairs were huge and comfy, champagne or mimosas were unlimited, and the staff gave the mothers a trio of macaroons in a clear box wrapped in a ribbon at the end for them to take home. \n\nThe regular price of the buffet is $70 per person but for Mother's Day it was $105.",

Upon walking in I was blown away! My nose was immediately flooded with soothing aromatherapy and the environment just oozes tranquility and relaxation not to mention it's absolutely gorgeous! The spa looks small from the outside but it's quite large. There was a room to the right for foot massages only and about 6-8 private treatment rooms. My massage itself was fantastic. I believe the massage therapist name was Rachel...I highly recommend the 80min massage! She used organic lavender oils which is my absolute favorite scent.

They actually have an extensive menu with salads and eggs benedict (around $10) as well as cheaper toast/bagel options. \nThe one barrista is super sweet, the first time I came in when she was working, she was so friendly I had to stop and figure out if I knew her and she was actually a best friend I'd forgotten I had, or just super awesome. It was the latter. She also took pity on us and brought us water after we'd been miserably staring at our screens/books for a few hours.\n\nCONS\nDrinks are a bit overpriced (2.75 for a tea?) and they don't have a huge selection of teas. \nThe AC was spotty last week, but they've resolved the issue I think.\n\nHighly recommend as a study spot, or a place for weekday/all day quiet breakfast/brunch/snack/solo dining.

Latin music adds an island flavor to the ambiance. The hearty sandwiches, with a healthy layering of ham, slow-roasted garlic-and-citrus-infused pork, Genoa salami, Swiss cheese, and pickle slices on fresh Cuban bread slathered with yellow mustard, are grilled in a special press, known as a plancha, before serving. The addition of salami is unique to the Tampa Bay area - where the sandwich first became popular in the States - due to its large Italian population at the time, a bit of trivia offered by the friendly owner while we waited for our meal. I have no idea how these compare to others in the neighborhood, but they're very tasty, filling, worthy of a return visit, and likely to become fully famous before long.",

It has a really cozy feel to it, very comfortable.It also has great drink specials during the week from 2-7pm, with specials on margaritas. \n\nI went to Vallartas after a shopping excursion around 3pm. The complementary chips came out warm and and salsa appeared to be very fresh. I also had the 2 for 1 margaritas and they were delicious. I ordered two tacos off the special which were $1 each and you could get both soft and hard tacos. I had both  soft chicken and beef tacos. The tacos came dressed with lettuce and tomato and queso and they accommodated my request for no cheese. The tacos were quite flavorful and were a nice accompaniment to the margaritas. The bartender was very attentive and friendly which was nice. \n\nI definitely will visit Vallartas again as I had an excellent experience. Vallartas is an excellent value!",

  "text": "I agree with Jake P's review.  This place is not up to Sheraton's reputation.  It's pretty ghetto.  It's not really dirty, but it's badly in need of updating.  And for the price, you're not getting much of a value.   You are solely paying for location when you stay here.  The rooms are just so lamely cookie cutter and stuck in the 80's, it's not even funny.  This place totally preys on the family members of students attending colleges in the area.  They are familiar with the school schedules and inflate their prices whenever an event is going on.  I can't say that I had a bad experience, but for almost $200, I should have had a great experience.  I felt like I was staying in a Days Inn.",

  "text": "Dark wood, mellow jazz, and candlelight join forces to create a warm ambiance in a large but uncluttered dining room. The menu is primarily American comfort food with a British twist. The creamy potato-leek soup was lighter than expected, as were oversized lobster ravioli in a tarragon-infused cream sauce, leaving plenty of room for tender and flavorful pepper-seared beef tenderloin with dense mashed potatoes flecked with rib meat and onions. A vegetarian special of pecan-crusted thyme pancakes with Gruyere sauce and grits was both filling and satisfying. For dessert, the liquid-center chocolate cake with coffee ice cream and mint leaves and the fresh berry souffle were superb. Sadly, the outstanding cuisine - in artistically-arranged presentantations - was not matched by the service. An arrogant, pretentious waiter, clad head-to-toe in black, acted as if he was doing us a favor when fulfilling any request, and made sure he took his time doing it. His disdainful attitude was enough to put a damper on the meal, and lose a star for this otherwise excellent dining spot.",

  "text": "Checked out KC's w/JJ for a few fruit bubble freezes.  Portion size, price, and quality easily earn them four-stars.  I mean, 3 bucks for a real fruit smoothie with bubbles. On my next trip, I decided I'd give their pastries a chance too.  There are a ton to choose from, so your bound to find something you like.  I know I managed to come across quite a few reasonably prices, fresh and nice sized pastries to enjoy following one of our meals in Chinatown.\n\nNot much else to say. Its a small shop that I think is family run.  I haven't seen more than 1 person working the counter and it is usually quite busy.  They are friendly, but usually appear to be running around too much to help with suggestions.  Given the prices, my advice is to roll the dice with anything you think looks good... it probably is!",

Stop and enjoy some music from bands playing in some of the dining establishments.  I had a two hour layover between my flights so I can't comment on the parking, TSA or ticketing agents but, my layover was comfortable here.",

  "text": "Our work team took Sunday afternoon off and decided to wander around the French Quarter. The group consensus favoured a place where we could sit outside and enjoy some live jazz and an adult beverage. And that's what we got! Service was friendly, but we had to come to them at either the bar or the coffee shop area. The music was quite good (the name of the band escapes me) and the expected free will donation at the end was a small price to pay for such a pleasant and relaxing part of our afternoon.",
